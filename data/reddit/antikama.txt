I read a report about a year ago saying 2% of the world owns crypto.

So many retarded comments in that thread I dont know where to begin
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:51:16
Going over to that subreddit is weird. They actually believe that bcash will be the  cryptocurrency in the future despite the fact that it has only been going down in btc ratio over all these years.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:59:40
It clearly will

Half of the posts over there are talking down bitcoin (the real bitcoin) and the others are posts like some tiny lawnmowing business accepted bcash lmao. Also whoever is giving reddit gold to the downvoted pro bitcoin comments on is hilarious, it must make them so angry

Just need some higher highs now
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:11:28
If your cryptocurrency isnt a store of value first in my opinion no one will use it to buy things. Who is going to use a coin that goes down over time like bcash as a currency? It doesnt make sense.
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:47:35
I didnt care about trump much before but because he mentioned bitcoin in a negative light, now Im pissed

The notch at the top ruins em.
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:41:29
Exactly. When it happens to stocks / crypto it shoots up way past fair value. Comes back and finds equilibrium but at a higher level than before the spike. Yet people always say its all over when it comes back down. It doesnt make sense.

We should call bcash bcrash from now on 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:04:42
When companies finally start using crypto they won't be using alts and other shitcoins it will be bitcoin and maybe a few others like ethereum etc. This is one of the reasons I believe bitcoin will perform better than altcoins in the future. Im 100% bitcoin btw.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:16:23
Any relation to rogercoin aka bcrash pumping? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:31:50
I hope you don't regret it
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:21:12
I cant believe that countries are actually considering negative interest rates. Just another reason to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-25 09:26:31
We must be getting close to breaking out of this wedge that we've been in for so long. Any day now.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:45:10
Plenty of people waiting on the sidelines looking to get into crypto imo. I read today 30% of people in London were planning to invest in crypto in the near future which seems high.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:45:55
Things just keep getting worse for bcrash
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:51:34
Im aiming for 100k. Bitcoin seems to hit nice round numbers before pulling back. But then again when bitcoin runs it tends to go further than people expect so I dunno.
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:13:22
Oh well if your step father says it....did he even say why it is "fundamentally flawed"?
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:02:42
Then they see it go up to 50k and say "why didn't you tell me to HODL"

bcash getting dumped hard
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:48:04
I used to think it was an issue but according to Andreas Antonopolous if the number of bitcoins is getting too low we can do things like increase the number of decimal points a bitcoin can be divisible by and other things like hard forks.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:59:28
increasing the number of decimal points isnt inflation you numpty. The number of bitcoins stays the same it just means you can divide a bitcoin into smaller amounts. I cant tell if you are even serious with that comment.
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:05:15
Getting ridiculous now
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:12:27
Im saving as much money as possible as I too believe bitcoin will start the next bull market in the next 6 or so months. An ETF approval comes and the next bull run starts sooner imo.
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:51:17
Is the reliability of transferring bitcoins on the LN the reason it isnt supported by wallets yet?
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:26:50
I regret not buying bitcoin when it was sub 1000 for so long and I just kept ignoring it like a fool.
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:16:27
They are quite delusional
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:51:59
Anyone holding BTC more than a year is in profit and you shouldn't really hold something as volatile as this anything less than one year anyway unless you are a trader. Think long term.
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:14:16

The word rogercoin made me lol. Never heard that one before.

It is. Im gonna start using it too.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:01:42
I think the Winklevoss ETF was supposed to be 0.1 bitcoins per etf share / unit. Not 100% sure though.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:35:32
With the higher lows we are getting we must surely be close to breaking up or down out of this formation. Its mind numbing.

Its one of the hardest things to do. But its what you should do
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:50:35
 Of course a bitcoin ETF would be good for bitcoin. It means any institution or person with a broker account can just buy them as shares which is much easier than buying them on an exchange and setting up wallets etc.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:18:35
This having an effect on the price or just technicals?
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:36:18
Ive got all my money in BTC so I may as well.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:27:08
there was always more than one ETF on the table Check out the link below
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:38:15
What app is that?
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:22:07
I don't think bitcoin will suddenly be worth millions no idea where you got that idea from. I've been investing in stock markets since 2009 nearly 10 years. Having the option for institutions to buy BTC via etf's and not having to set up their own storage systems for holding BTC etc. It just makes it that much easier than without it. If you can't see that at least giving people the option to invest in bitcoin via etf units/shares will help the price of BTC then I can't help you.
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:49:05
You don't need it. But it will help the price to go up. If that matters to you.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:18:43
Give them 1 star on the web of trust add on for firefox and chrome if you have it.

@_date: 2018-08-30 10:39:11
I feel kinda sorry for them. They must be so sure that their little shitcoin is gonna take off, one day....they say. The market has spoken and it has chosen Bitcoin as the number 1 and bitcoin cash is only losing its market share.
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:32:00
If you want a bigger returns I don't know why you'd be against a bitcoin ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:56:18
And because everyone wants to use eftpos but the fees are too high for a coffee. It makes perfect sense to use BTC when fees are so much lower than eftpos
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:45:28
He actually thinks bcash can overtake BTC as the real bitcoin. Hes delusional.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:55:23
Would it be illegal to 51% attack bcash? Probably not.
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:44:59
Hes a great investor but he knows nothing about technology
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:39:09
Do you know if a bitcoin futures etf is better or worse than a bitcoin etf that buys and sells actual bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:42:05
You need to think longer term with crypto. It has huge booms then it falls back, but to a higher level than it was before the boom. 8 months is way too short to judge bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:40:50
Hopefully this will trigger other large companies to accept BTC
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:08:11
I'm not saying we'll definitely get one soon, just that it will be good for the price of bitcoin like with the first gold etf. Whats on the 15th?
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:47:44
I thought it was known he said he doesnt understand technology stocks so I don't know why we'd get his his opinion about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:28:21
Anyone think bitcoin may start rising again in the lead up to the VanEck- SolidX Bitcoin ETF. From what I've read people think it has a slightly better chance of approval than the Winklevoss ETF did.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:06:48
I have over 10 years experience in the markets and I initially wrote bitcoin off as just being geek internet money. Once I learned about the tech and learned about what makes money money it was easy to see the appeal of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:14:55

Bitcoin can be programmed to make it more user friendly. Satoshis or mBTC can be used for units of account. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:04:17
I don't understand that logic either. The price was just under 20k for a few days at most. As most of us know bitcoin generally overshoots the mark as the world starts talking about it, falls back and finds equilibrium at a higher price than before the bull run. Hold long term and this eliminates that problem (so far at least)
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:04:18
Do bitcoin and binancecoin have an inverse relationship? Often whenever binancecoin goes down we go up.
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:04:36
You arent late in my opinion. We are still in the early days of adoption
@_date: 2019-03-26 18:23:23
I read that a while ago that only 2 percent of the world owns any crypto. In my opinion we are still early adopters. There is plenty of room for another bull run.
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:36:37
Split it imo. Not worth putting all your money in a savings account for only 5% per year. And FWIW I think bitcoin at 4k will be seen as cheap in the coming years, its still a good time to get in.
@_date: 2019-03-17 11:14:58

You figured out bcash was a scam before most other bcashers at least. Most of the people over there will be watching their coins lose value against bitcoin for years to come.

I'm amazed that all them bcashers over there are using the bitcoin ticker as their subreddit name. Its a shame they get away with crap like this.
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:34:46
Its not until I learned about bitcoin that I learned how bad some of the things are in the banking system. I mean every weekend for quite a while now my online banking account has been under system maintenance. This doesnt happen with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:13:43
I read some old threads and people are saying the same things now about crashing just like how it was when it went from over 1000 to 300. I'd say we are probably at or near the bottom but who knows.
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:26:12
1mb blocks were part of his vision too. But even so its just what one person thought many years ago.
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:06:32
Thats a nice statistic to follow. Also good to see bcrash growing near the slowest of the top 10 despite rising the most in price.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:36:02
Its a shame satoshi didn't buy bitcoin.com when he had the chance. bitcoin.com is one of the scammy things keeping bcash alive.

XRP is now where it was on May 2017, it often gets pumped then falls back to where it is now. BTC dominance is still rising so I think its a good idea to buy bitcoin. Keep in mind this is a bitcoin subreddit so most are going to say buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:48:50
Like TCP / IP?
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:13:03

@_date: 2019-06-29 15:48:49
bcash is continually losing its market share to bitcoin. Currently at 3.6% of bitcoins market cap. Plus why would you want to buy a coin that gets 51% attacked?

Well the price of bitcoin tends to fall in the days leading up to the expiry of the futures and it tends to rise after the expiry as shown in the article below.

Keep in mind when we went from 10k to 20k that was the at absolute peak of the bull market. Im not one to rule it out however, bitcoin being bitcoin

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:41:11
If bitcoin goes to 50k or higher I dont think you will care whether you bought at 9k or 8k. Now is a good time to buy imo. Im still buying as I get more funds
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:52:13
why anyone would buy a coin that gets 51% attacked is beyond me
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:56:52
There are services available that take the bitcoin payments and convert them to fiat currencies which removes a lot of the volatility. The volatility of bitcoin will decrease as the market gets bigger as well
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:22:24
Its likely we will eventually pass all time highs eventually

Anyone can buy crypto even stupid people. I guess thats why people buy bitcoin SV
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:03:42
Does anyone think that the reason we havent had any 40% pullbacks like in the 2017 bull run is because of the institutional presence in bitcoin this time around?
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:59:14
Its amazing how much foresight they had back then.
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:46:54
A bitcoin ETF means higher bitcoin price so Im all for it.

I think in a bull market you are better off just buying at market price
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:39:47
It dipped 20% a couple of times. That was the time to buy. People are just expecting too large a dip

bcash has already failed as a coin imo. Only downwards from here. Nice video
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:52:49
I hope this is a joke I cant tell
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:11:54
Its pretty funny. Say you bought $100 of bcash in the last year or so and $100 in bitcoin. Even though bitcoin has a slightly higher fee those smart bcashers lost HEAPS more because the value of bcash has gone nowhere since it came out and bitcoin has gone up heaps in comparison. They never talk about that.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:13:21
Andreas antonopoulos has a good book on bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:07:22
No one is even using that coin. Over 50% of transactions are coming from one single address AND it got 51% attacked recently. Why on earth would anyone with any common sense buy it?

Its funny isnt it. I try telling people about bitcoin who really should understand it better but they think its "all over" lol. People who say that simply dont understand the market cycles that bitcoin goes through.
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:26:26
Bitcoin shorts are the lowest they've been since march '18
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:15:57
In my opinion a lot of it was caused by us breaking through long term resistance at 4200
@_date: 2019-02-06 10:14:44
When people say this kind of thing why do they ignore the lightning network?
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:08:03
I doubt he predicted that we would go from 4100 to 5200 in just 7 days either
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:08:26
That feel when you heavily bought the bottom.
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:35:23
I want to get rich and I have no problems saying so. Most people holding crypto do it because of this also.

My experience tells me that bitcoin tends to go way past what people think it will go to. Then fall back a lot further than people think it will go, but finishing at a higher price than before the bull run. So yes, I think 100k is possible.
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:46:27
No idea but Im holding long term either way
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:20:21
bcash will need to do a lot more transactions per second to be a global currency. What they have now wont cut it. The lightning network can eventually scale to millions of transactions per second.
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:30:31

Less than 1% of people in the world own bitcoin right now. My point is that its still early days in terms of adoption its not too late to get back into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:03:38
Personally I'd wait a bit longer till its in a clear bull market

The amount of people who I talk to about bitcoin that think its all over amazes me.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:13:12
A block size increase just kicks the can down the road a few more years (like bcash). It doesnt solve the scaling problem at all.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:06:43
You are right. We havent even hit max fomo yet. Plenty of room for more gains over the coming months

@_date: 2019-04-05 16:31:44
After investing in stocks for over 10 years and crypto for a couple I'd say technical analysis works more with crypto than with stocks. In my opinion this is because there is a lot more normal people investing in crypto compared to the higher amount of institutional investment in stocks.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:11:31
Do you know why veriblock are doing what they are doing with bitcoin? I dont know much about it.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:03:54

bcash nearly up 50% now. Feel like vomiting
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:57:04
Last bullrun on bitcoin we had pullbacks around like 40% and yet it still went up to 20k. This is normal for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:53:12
I still dont get why people think it was dead? Even at a price of 4k that is still right up there going off where it started at. I guess people just dont understand bitcoins market cycles.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:30:01
This is great!
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:45:06
100k by 2020 maybe - 1 million sounds too unrealistic
@_date: 2018-11-04 11:27:52
Any chance of approval or just the usual?
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:28:35
I agree. Last major bull run we saw pullbacks of like 40% but it kept going up to 20k
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:04:09
Its just going through normal market cycles
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:39:14

The decision on the 9 bitcoin ETF's is due today I think. I know people are getting sick of the ETF's but thought I'd point it out.
Edit: I think its just the comments deadline today.
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:48:33
I believe its just a simpler way to buy bitcoin. Anyone who has a brokerage account can buy them like they buy shares and dont have to worry about the keys etc.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:38:14
Bitcoin has over 3500 developers last I read. Is it true bcash only has around 150 or so?
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:10:38
Thanks bcrash
@_date: 2018-11-17 11:36:38
I don't like seeing people lose money but with bcash it sure is satisfying seeing it plummet.
@_date: 2018-11-07 06:41:53
Couldn't help but laugh
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:27:45


The timing of it all says it all really
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:15:15
Maybe because bitcoin was talked about more in 2017 is the reason there were more obituaries. Not sure though.

@_date: 2019-09-02 21:17:38
They are using Coinmarketcaps bitcoin dominance which just hit 70%. Others websites may have a different number
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:05:33
You'd think the price wouldnt go down as adoption of bitcoin becomes more widespread. We are right near the beginning imo.
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:03:35
I think most people start off thinking bitcoin is a scam. It wasnt until I looked into it much further that I realised it wasnt a scam
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:44:59
I think the main reason it kept getting delayed was that it didnt have approval from the SEC which it currently does
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:49:40
You'd think if they didn't think the ETF would pass they would just announce it. I can't think of a reason to delay unless its to finish the little details. 
Zerohedge also published an article yesterday saying 2 inside sources thought the BTC ETF would be delayed a while and then approved FWIW.
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:56:45
There will be times it will be far ahead of the prediction line and times that it will be below. Expecting a slow, steady and consistant rise like that line suggests aint gonna happen.

Peter Brandt, the man who predicted the great crypto crash of 2018 and the price increase this year when everyone else was talking about price capitulation thinks we may have entered the next parabolic phase for bitcoin. I know predictions are just predictions but I thought it was interesting

@_date: 2019-05-13 19:25:27
tether FUD, bitfinex FUD, china FUD, exchange hacks. None of it is really affecting bitcoins price really - only a temporary pullback then straight back up.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:08:20
I read a couple of weeks ago that it only took around 2 billion dollars (I think this was the number) to push bitcoin from 300 to 20,000. It doesnt seem like much money compared to the market cap does it

I read an article saying 50% of transactions on bcash lately were from a SINGLE ADDRESS!
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:21:59
Hope it wasnt a lot!

Sell enough so that I never have to work again and HODL the rest
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:15:17
how I feel lately
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:16:33
Bitcoin tends to reach all time highs and smash right through them so I think this is conservative
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:47:46
If it was possible to just remove peoples bitcoins like that I would want nothing to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:33:30
Its fun watching bcash die after all the damage theyve caused
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:12:47
Cant expect it to go up in a straight line
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:29:03
If anyone talks in absolutes when it comes to crypto it just shows they dont understand crypto.

Imagine having roger ver as your leader like bcash. But you are right, its one of the best things satoshi did.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:20:22
Its common to use logarithmic charts when the stock / crypto etc goes up 1000's of percent.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:00:59
Was about to post the same thing. Bitcoin up slightly and bcash down 7.5%. People are finally waking up after the whole hard fork bullshit
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:17:57
I dont like either of them alts. Ripple hasnt moved in like 3 months while bitcoin is up over 80% in the same time period
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:27:22
They are good as an inverse indicator but thats about it

Netflix is no substitute for blockbuster
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:22:31
If it passes 20k I'd expect it to go well past it judging by past bull runs.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:30:56
If it does happen I wont keep it in fiat Im going to buy other assets that produce consistent income. Ive got enough bitcoins that if it did hit 100k I could sell enough to live off and because my living expenses are so low I would actually be making much more money off these assets than I would be using even using conservative estimates.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:39:46
that was fun
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:00:06
Its a sign that we are at the start of the next bull market. Things like tether FUD, exchange hacks arent really affecting the price now.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:05:53
The creators of XRP own 60% of all XRP. Centralised much?
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:19:35
thats an awesome pepe
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:44:58
absolute disaster
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:27:18
In the last major bull run we had pullbacks as large as 40% and yet it still kept going higher. If you set a stop loss you will run the risk of getting stopped out only to see it go higher. Unless you can watch the price every single day its not worth it. Personally I just HODL
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:13:59
The majority of the volume was at around 6400 or so not 6000 IIRC but we could go straight past it who knows.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:49:06
If you expect bitcoin to be at all time highs every day you are gonna have a bad time
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:57:38
Exactly. When I was watching from the sidelines while waiting for the next bear market I thought 2.5k was the top. Then I thought 5k was the top then 10k and it still went to 20k.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:46:42
Is CNBC the 95% accurate inverse indicator that people talk about or is that another one?
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:21:25
Unfortunately it has affected just about every other coin negatively. Its fun watching it die though.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:30:44
I used to watch the channel krowns krypto cave, he said bitcoin wouldnt go above 6000 for the rest of 2019 back in feb. The fact that he talked in absolutes about something like crypto shows he has no clue about crypto and yet people think he knows what hes talking about. These youtube TA experts often have NFI.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:05:49
If bitcoin goes up 1000% then falls 85% I have no problem with it. Whereas bcash is the lowest its ever been.
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:05:45
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:16:04
Thats why Im so excited by the lightning network - it has exponential growth and can eventually support millions of transactions per second. Increasing the blocksize just kicks the can down the road.
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:56:17
I used to be a bitcoin skeptic. Like a lot of people I thought it was just geek internet money. Then the price hit 5k and I thought "wow there must be something more to this". I think the higher we go the more people will look into it.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:31:39
Still pretty low imo
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:11:31
I bought bitcoin at all them levels lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:28:51
He doesn't seem to understand that something like tulip mania or other bubbles of the type only really happen once. They dont tend to repeat, going to higher and higher levels after each downturn.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:42:00
I think everyone who owns bitcoin has said this at some point
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:01:24
I think the last major bull market started about this far from the halvening too
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:36:26
Thats what Im saying - that because bitcoin  goes to higher and higher levels after each downturn it isnt worthless
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:04:23
Im very much expecting to get enquiries from friends and family when the price starts mooning again.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:08:43
I like how over there they are trying to play it off like its no big deal
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:12:45
I would have sold at $100 or so anyway
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:02:06
why not
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:15:48
When you think about it going from under 300 to 20,000 in a year and a half, it only seemed logical that it wouldn't get there. But bitcoin does tend to surprise Ive learnt
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:29:00
In my opinion most people just look at the price, see that its going down and think it must be all over. Having been in the stock market for over 10 years and crypto for just under a year its pretty obvious that the market isnt always as logical as people think it is.
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:24:05
Hes trying to buy adoption and that wont work.
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:08:41
fucken bcash ugh
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:27:39
How good is it waking up in the morning and seeing a higher bitcoin price so often. That crypto winter was so depressing, glad its over.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:24:45
It must have been pretty euphoric to watch bitcoin go up so much so quickly. Hope I can experience it the next bull run.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:38:48
I learnt the hard way not to try to time my bitcoin purchases
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:57:11
I recall a post on this sub around $300 saying we wouldnt see these prices again and he was right.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:33:29
As long as roger and bcash dont fuck things up again I think now is a good time to buy but no one really knows for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:55:30
I have like 300 in cash in my bank account and 1.6 BTC all up. I think im addicted to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:11:31
Well its better for new investors than trading bitcoin. Thats a great way to lose all your money.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:35:37
When I use my phone I generally just go on the youtube app or browse reddit. I dont go on websites that have malware on them so in my case my phone is probably more secure than my desktop
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:28:28
Im locked and loaded bois. Its moon time.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:06:33
I mean...if thats the best you've got....
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:15:29
losing 85% isnt losing all your money especially when it goes up over 10x. Do you even maths? Bitcoin has done this several times before as the market tends to repeat itself.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:35:52
shitcoins gonna shitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:46:13
Its funny listening to them talk about how much they dont like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:35:10
A lot of people will buy as it is going parabolic and sell at the bottom.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:04:58
We broke out of the formation Ive shown in the link below and many people bought the breakout which caused the price to spike. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:26:24
When we get up to 40% pullbacks like the last bull run just remember - HODL
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:08:47
Even though its dying slowly they keep posting rubbish about becoming the worlds fist global currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:31:27
bcash down over 11%, bitcoin about even. Today is a great day.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:16:39
I have a feeling you'll be back eventually
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:33:40
I saw that litecoin has as many active addresses lately as dogecoin so make of that what you will. Its bitcoin or nothing for me fwiw
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:10:54
The REKTER phase according to his little pic is much lower than where the rally started whereas bitcoin is still well above the start of the last rally so he is technically wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:58:41
This bcash pump cant be natural
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:37:46


thats pretty cool!

Confirmed transactions per day are the highest in 16 months according to the link below.

@_date: 2018-12-14 10:33:10
down 13% lmao pulling the market down
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:17:01
My online banking shuts down at night basically every single weekend for maintenance. Its not until I learned about how amazing bitcoin is that I realised how bad our current banking systems are.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:12:23
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:39:59
HODL mate
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:30:56
Theres a massive difference between bitcoin and 99% of altcoins
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:43:29
But bitcoin had a much higher run up than stocks did. A larger pullback is to be expected.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:33:15
sue him
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:02:25
I know many people on here dont follow technical analysis but a lot of people do and trade off that. Its a self fulfilling prophecy. Because we just broke out of the ascending triangle we were in many people bought the breakout.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:17:46
I bought more bitcoin today too after sending money over the weekend too. Seems like a good theory.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:26:58
are you new?
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:38:13
I did think we were still pretty early in terms of bitcoins development. This just confirms it for me

He also tried to get jimmy song to agree to a 1 million dollar bet a while back
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:33:03
maybe its easier to manipulate than bitcoin considering the smaller pool of capital in it.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:31:51
Dont panic if it falls, we are at the start of the next bull run imo. Just HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:00:33
