I just took a look in there, seemed much closer to my first vision of overly negative crop unfortunately... But I'm not someone to put my money somewhere without having listened to the reasons why I shouldn't, mostly because I don't have a lot of it to put, but also because I'm a cheap bastard.

Honestly they seem to have already done that. They recognizes their biggest threat and attacks it, very understandable. You don't blame Voldemort's attacks on Harry Potter on his poor intelligence.

Ok I see, I'll have to read up some more it looks like.

Ah, I see. I have noticed that while the atmosphere here is very positive towards bitcoin, and I always like to hang around positive people, I did receive both massive downvotes and positive help at the same time last time I actually tried to ask questions here . Maybe it would be good to subscribe to both subs, since it does seem rather difficult to hold a critical discussion here, and it's easy to get carried away. I don't quite agree with your criticism that you put forward here, but I'm not really in the mood or place to make a discussion about it, and I'm sure you've already heard it all anyway.

Yeah, you're right about that, although could atlaest have the potential to be a strictly positive sub, for example by only focusing on support for atheists and how to deal with difficult situations in areas where atheism is in minority. It could also highlight atheist/secular "wins", etc. I haven't been, but I'm guessing that the majority of the posts aren't about that, though. :)

Wow thank you! Does this mean I own Bitcoins now? I'm way more excited than what would seem reasonable for such a small amount of money. :D Cheers!

Thank you, right now seems to be an interesting time to start with bitcoin! Someone should make the first graph but with a Minimum mean square error line instead, would look much nicer. Will be looking more into investing a small sum as a start.

Wtf.. Please tell me that is not a whole sub dedicated to being negative about bitcoin... Why do people like that exist? Passionate about being negative..

As someone who has a curiosity and has passively followed it on and off in the last couple of years, what do you mean by exponential growth? The rate today seems to be at about 1 Bitcoin to 360 dollars. As I mentioned, I haven't followed it that closely, but it seems to have been on a fairly steady fall since the 1000 dollar peak. I don't remember exactly when that was, but it seems like bitcoin has been going downwards for about a year now. Comment?

Wow, thanks! Between getting called troll by several people and getting downvoted for asking questions and people giving good advice and randomly giving money I have no idea what to think about this community. I guess ignore the trolls and embrace the nice ones as usual.
But please no more now, I'm starting to feel like a beggar, and that was certainly not the intention. Cheers! :)

Haha that's actually quite funny. :D I guess his good taste in names didn't get passed on to his taste in posts.
EDIT: I bet you don't want to really start the game where you get judged by your name though, ! Thanks for mentioning it though, atleast made sense of the other troll comment.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:16:12
I'm bitter as fuck about that as well! 
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:35:36
looks like you got downvoted anyway
@_date: 2015-02-20 09:52:35
Didn't watch it, but it sounds like something someone would say when they want to show how progressive and positive towards this idea that is alien to them is. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:49:15
Ah ok, I see, thank you!

I always only had a vague understanding of BTC, so I always just figured I had misunderstood something... Isn't BTC commonly praised for its anonymity? How does this fit together with every BTC being tracable?
