The problem with your line of thought is that it expects thqt unregulated/deregulated industries should still be idiot-proof. Fact is, people need to learn to use critical thinking and to take responsibility for their choices. 
Gox fucked up on many occasions already,  and should have been abandoned by the market long ago. People are dumb, lazy and used to being protected, that's why they kept going back.

You won't refer to the majority people as pigs, and I won't have to to prove my point.
Most PEOPLE wouldn't know what to do with gold (or how valuable it is) either. Sure they'd know you can make jewellery with it, or that they can sell it on the open market, but they don't know the value of holding it as a value store or as a hedge for inflation. People aren't pigs, but they're not always a whole lot smarter, either. And the ones that are, know the real value of gold beyond making shiny trinkets.
The fact is that most people want immediate gratification. Wealthy people understand that. And they provide it. Then they patiently collect their money and sit on it until more good opportunities arise instead of spending it on the next thing that will give them a tiny dopamine rush.
Yes, it's been slow, and yes it sucks that you lost money. I get that. But if I were you, I wouldn't divest completely. Now, if your whole portfolio is BTC, that was your first mistake, and I'd probably sell a huge chunk of it. That being said, I'd hold on to a fair amount. The key to doing well long term is a balanced portfolio, and I don't think BTC is going away.

not yet, but you can bet your ass they will, and depending on your country, they have anywhere from 5-10 years to audit you.
Building a system that can do that won't take much, just hook into some APIs that already exist (or, just create their own system - it's our money they're paying with anyway), and voila - "remember that tax return where you tried to launder money with bitcoin? Oh yeah, we're going to need all of your wallet addresses to prove the source of income...."
The fact they do it right now with paper shows their pretty boundless resources to even do it all manually. What makes you think this "declare your mining income" isn't just something they'll use as a flag to audit you later?

I think you greatly underestimate the amount of back market currency dealing that happens in countries like that. No one wants to hold bolivars. Something like BTC would catch on pretty quickly.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:57:55
i get you, but it looks like he just exchange ~$200USD of BTC for ~$200 of Bolivar. So that's not really a "deal" of any sort.
Now if he could find a way to convert those back into USD at the official rate, I'd be impressed.

@_date: 2016-02-24 22:30:53
I dunno - I just don't think bandwidth is a real issue. It is already sort of a one-time issue at start-up, but that's sort of unavoidable. Private settling networks like LN fix one part of decentralization, but break another part of it.
Don't get me wrong, LN isn't a bad idea for people that opt-in to it - banks will want to use LN because it would be too costly for them to dump all of their transactions onto the blockchain. It can also be good for privacy. But that creates some centralization. It should be an option, not mandatory.
This option resolves the important latency/bandwidth issues during the block hashing. If there were 1000 sub-blocks, most people would have 950-999 of the other sub-blocks before the last one is hashed (and could actively keep getting the rest while the remaining are being hashed), then it's a quicker catch-up for the last-step finalization main-block hash than it would be to download one monster final-hashed block.
essentially, this is pre-hashing parts of the block in smaller pieces and distributing the finished parts.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:41:47
Not quite.
Transporting 16x1mb is different than 1x16mb because it won't happen at the same time. The latency issue is about moving a big amount of data, all at once, fast enough. Since sub-blocks won't all solve at the same time, the solved ones can download while the unsolved ones are still hashing. At the time of the final sub-block solve, the load will be roughly equal to now. we can even make sub blocks smaller to reduce latency, but still get more throughput.
And 20% was just. a number I threw out. Could be 10. It doesn't mean it has to always be full, just that there needs to be reasonable room to scale up and avoid dropping transactions.

@_date: 2016-02-24 22:33:17
Interesting point, though, couldn't that cause another sort of attack, where the miner "sets" a big block size externally, uses a small block size internally, solves it, and then says "oh, my bad guys, I actually said small block, and here's the one I solved...ok, now lets try a big block this time"...over and over... causing him to run a long chain of small blocks, lying and telling everyone else they should be big?
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:08:00
will banks here really give you the official rate though? If so, I'm buying some bolivar direct and doing that....
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:04:32
well, with this proposal, we can actually reduce the sub-block size, but still process more.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:37:28
Hi! Thanks for the feedback!
Though, not quite - a transaction wouldn't only be recorded once per block, it may in fact appear multiple times. There may even be conflicting/colliding transactions (double-spends) but the one that gets propagated in the most sub blocks would "win" when the block is finalized.
We'll probably reach a point where the need for security and/or speed will determine how many subblocks the transaction will be on.
- If a transaction needs to be secure, but not fast, it can still be in as little as one sub-block
- If a transaction needs to be fast, but not secure, it can still be in as little as one sub-block
- If a transaction needs to be fast and secure, then it needs to be in &gt;50% - seeing it on &gt;50% of the sub-blocks means it can no longer be double-spent. This could also mean an intermediate confirmation (say, when 80% of blocks are mined, but in them the &gt;50% of total blocks with the transaction were included)
of course, with all this double-spend data (since attempts would be stored in-chain) some sort of "follow the coin" mechanism can be built in to monitor for risky-payors. If someone has tried to doublespend the last 5 transactions, chances are you'll want to be careful with them and wait for some confirmations.
Also, each broadcast to a sub-block (block-cast?) would cost a nominal amount, meaning that there would be added cost to double-spending since both the validated and invalidated spends would cost money. The more sub-blocks you need to buy into, the less attractive the attack becomes, especially for low-cost items.
@_date: 2016-02-26 12:44:41
You can submit it with the same input (see the part you didn't quote), but to submit it to 16 sub-blocks, you'd need to submit it with 16x the fees.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:38:54


@_date: 2016-02-26 02:59:08


The total bandwidth isn't the issue, it's the latency caused by the peaks. The arguments I've heard point to (peak) bandwidth as a problem BECAUSE it causes latency. Fixing the bandwidth issue is attacking the symptom, not the problem.


Wrong, the fee would be for each post to a sub-block. If they were posting to 16 sub-blocks, each would have it's own fee, (16x fees). DDoSing actually would get more expensive the more the sub-blocks there is (making it more secure as it grows). 
Realistically, a transaction would be "safe" from a doublespend risk at posting to &gt;50% of sub-block (in this case, 9), but doing that would only be required if the transaction NEEDS to be secured.
We'll probably reach a point where the need for security and/or speed will determine how many subblocks the transaction will be on (and thus the cost will reflect the importance, and will discourage spam transactions)
- If a transaction needs to be secure, but not fast, it can still be in as little as one sub-block
- If a transaction needs to be fast, but not secure, it can still be in as little as one sub-block
- If a transaction needs to be fast and secure, then it needs to be in &gt;50% - seeing it on &gt;50% of the sub-blocks means it can no longer be double-spent. This could also mean an intermediate confirmation (say, when 80% of blocks are mined, but in them the &gt;50% of total blocks with the transaction were included)

I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing.
I'm also proposing smallish blocks.
What's I'm saying (and I may have misunderstood your message) but what in your method prevents the solver from lying (setting the number of sub-blocks extremely high), solving as small number of sub-blocks, and then saying "I said small number of sub-blocks, btw, I solved it, so I choose high!"..and repeating that.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:51:49
We could. But then when that fills up, will we half again? And then again? At what point can you no longer half? Then we still need to increase block size.
And when you pull from both ends like that (bigger blocks, shorter times) you increase the chance of latency, which increases the chance of working on the wrong chain, which means a ton more orphaned blocks.
Check out BIP 2049 instead - we have some good discussion going on in each of the threads.

See my other posts for a reply to this.
Too big blocks breaks centralization because it creates latency. Too small blocks creates centralization because stuff has to be settled off-chain. Both points are valid, and are not mutually exclusive.
This solution side-steps both of those issues. Sub-blocks can remain small, and can spread easily, while the transaction volume can still increase. This also avoids messing with block times, which would create orphans. 
This also has the effect of not forcing LN onto everyone, but still solving the same problem. LN can still exist and would have some legitimate purposes (for banks, for example), but it would be optional.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:03:51

@_date: 2016-02-24 20:43:29
2 isn't really an issue though, storage is cheap and I'm pretty sure the cost will fall faster than the point where it will matter.
Also,  is a seperate issue, but there should be some protocol for optionally pruning the ledger somehow - like, you can download the whole thing, validate it as of a certain date, and then dump old transactions for a slim wallet. 
AND/OR 
make it extremely for users to set up a trusted node with QT that validates the chain and have mobile wallet clients "log-in" or pairs/trusts it - so sort of like everyone has their own personal version of blockchain.info
both of those reduce the effect of  - but at the end of the day, the blockchain IS going to get HUGE, even with LN. We just need to get better with handling it, and reducing the amount of data that needs to be moved around to get things done.

I think the real problem is that the success of the system relies on people perpetuating the BS that the system is ok. No one want to be the one to ruin the party, so it'll keep going until we're out of bullshit options to prop it up.
And holding tangible assets won't always help. The price of everything is pretty inflated. Expect the value of a lot of assets to drop precipitously in tandem with fiat currency if/when there's a correction.

"It's not backed by anything"?
What the hell is any currency backed with, especially when they just print more of it whenever they please and their basic premises are that people must keep consuming, and to do that, they dollar has to get less valuable, and instead of ever really paying off debt, let's just make our money worthless.
Economics is bullshit pseudo-math giving a false sense of precision. The reason they don't seem to take bitcoin seriously is because they're so caught up in their theoretical fuckery, that they don't realize what a blunt tool it all is.
