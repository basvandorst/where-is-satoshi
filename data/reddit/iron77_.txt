2bitidiot himself isn't 100% sure what happened, so yeah, I don't think this request really blames him or anything.

Haha, if you manage to listen to at least half of it you get a sushi bonus!
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:34:21
Yeah, true.

Bailout would be, if the network would artificially do a charge-back of these coins, on the same blockchain, and that would be tragic for bitcoin.
Though new currency is just like issuing completely new crypto that would be traded on the free market and not tied to BTC. And, there is a slight chance, that at least fraction of the value, might be someday recovered :).

Surely, he would need to be involved. Though for millions of reasons it might be hard for him to do it.

So perhaps keep the number intact, and pay miners from Mark's alleged share if he is found responsible for losing it? :)

I was also thinking about exactly same thing! :)
There is chance that these GOXBTC currency will become valuable someday, as possessing them is like having pieces of a fallen museum xD (Or they can even maybe 'someday' accessible, as opposed to their current 'unavalable', state atm)
Also, if enough influential people would posses GOXBTC, they will make sure they will get valuable someday :). Crazy idea but perhaps an interesting way forward in this hopeless situation.

That's most likely because there is a barrier on the usability side, I mean - where the heck is the bitcoin address?! I went to original link, Ctrl+F "bitcoin" "btc" "address" does not give me anything, nothing in the comments here as well. BTC donation link should be easy to find if one likes to see coins coming. Sure everyone can dig deeper (I guess it might even not be that hard to find ;)), though it is a laziness barrier that will stop many if not most people - well, that's how life works. So - make sure the donation address is visible and proofed to be her and I don't think she'll need to wait to long for her coins :).

Also, they shall not be called 'JusticeCoin', but 'GOXBTC' or 'GoxCoin' and the issued total should be exactly same number as of total Mt. Gox BTC liability - that would make them to appear kind of cool! xD 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:25:28
Why shall it be traded 1:1? Let the market decide what the value would be! xD

I'm sure that since at least early 2013, for Trusted it was 10K BTC daily limit and $100K daily limit. I cannot remember about 2011 for sure though, so perhaps I'm wrong there. 
But well, if you're saying there's no strong evidence that 550k was Gox's transaction it might still not be even their address.

Even so, there should be a solid chance that at least he can point to some of the public addresses that the coins were held in. Even if he lost a password and forgotten/lost public addresses, there should be blockchain trail to these funds and with his little helps these cold addresses should be easily identifiable, I'd imagine. If after XX years they would start to move, people would at least know what happened.

no matter how pleasing it might sound to everyone who had btc on gox, it would be very hard hit to the bitcoin itself if chargeback like this ever happens

Just inb4 assuming this 40k was simply a user withdrawal - I think there were always, and at least at that date already, quite strict withdrawal limits, surely under 40k, even if you were verified to the max.
