I have a strap of unloaded, unique paper wallet sitting on my desk. They are used as a conversation starter about Bitcoin and can be used to explain public vs private keys... Etc
But really they are for the strip club... gonna make it rain.

You can save your seed words on several inexpensive encrypted memory cards/flash drives.

Just curious,  why EUR? 
 If you expect a USD or bitcoin price drop and want to shore up losses you could convert to other cryptos and hold offline.  With fiat you are kinda stuck with trusting them or taking it out.  
I have not heard of problems holding online,  but I don't know many who would recommend keeping serious weight online.

Sign up at coin base or Kraken,  both are US based.  Or find an exchange in your country. 
Follow their sign up instructions and link a credit card or bank account and buy. 
After that,  keep your coin on their site if you wish,  or transfer to a privately held wallet.  You could make paper wallets or download an app on your Android or Apple.  
YMMV on these 
Paperwallets : bitaddress.org,  bitcoinpaperwallet.Com 
Apps that people like : Myceliem,  Jaxx,  breadwallet

So....  Mining had never really been 'worth it'.  With that said,  originally you would mine with a CPU that you already had,  then a video card you had,  now you have to buy purpose built hardware to mine. 
Originally when a CPU was used,  it was not really worth it because of the potential damage it could cause,  and btc was almost worthless.  Then GPU mining took off and the GPUs cost hundreds to thousands to mine and the BTC was worth dollars.  Now miners cost thousands to 10s of thousands,  and the btc are worth a lot..... 
It's always relative. 
Mining cost to run a setup to net 100 btc in a year would cost about $100k-$200k (estimated) or more. 
If the price continues,  in 5 years people will say mining was worth it.  But the same will be true about buying and holding. 
When I gpu mined,  I spent about $200 for a graphics card plus power.  My buddy spent about $500 card and a couple power supplies,  which burnt out during mining, plus power. I would say we paid about $1000 total.  For that we have about 100BTC,  at the time they were $3-$12 each...  We should have just bought $1000 worth ($80 per month for a year)  and we would have many more BTC then mining. 
Clearly,  my mining paid off as of now...  But buying and holding would have been better.  And that is factoring I still have a good video card to use for games (porn). 
If you want to mine competitively,  you need to constantly upgrade hardware and add more power since the btc network is increasing difficulty.  
TL DR : My opinion do not mine,  buy and hold.

Since you asked... You can get a low end antminer from Amazon. 
But as everyone here has said,  you are probably better off just buying.  Run a Calc and see what your expected return would be.

I guess I understood the Fed as the federal Reserve, which is a private bank who makes our monetary policies and sets interest rates, and directs the mint to print money. 
I pay taxes to the IRS.
 
Can someone explain the relationship between the two, or how post 1913 changed things?

Talk to your bank,  if they freak out go to another bank...  Seriously not all banks are 100% awful,  don't let them think you are their hostage. 
I work at a smaller local bank and buy and sell btc,  ethereum and  litecoin regularly. 
If your bank does freak out because you are a millionaire,  fuckem.  You are a millionaire,  other banks will be willing to lick your genitals.

I have never been told they would arrive on a weekend. Trying to figure out the Timeline here baised on the post... 
We're they due on Friday or Saturday? 
Was the money debited from your bank, or was there a bank problem? 
Considering a bank transfer is less automated then one might think, there could have been a timing issues and the money didn't arrive correctly, and then you should have then Monday once it's resolved. 
Otherwise can you call Coinbase and ask what happened?

Just a thought, and you are going to pay a premium for sure, but you could buy denarium that is preloaded.

I completely agree with you, but given the age issue, your options might be limited. It was just a suggestion.

Me and a buddy got in when you could mine with a $100 gpu,  and used a mining pool.  Received about 1 BTC per day...  That was when they were worth $3-$7. Made a killing

I think the Alts are very likely going to drop in price once the bitcoin network congestion gets resolved... Which ever method comes out ahead. 
With that said, I like ethereum, litecoin, and ripple, and lumin. Could also watch counter party. 
Will have to see how they progress.

I guess the premium you will pay at a atm, might be worth it considering personal safety during a in person buy. 
My 2 cents. 
Where did you get your first coins? Is that no longer an option?

Coinbase, I loved and hated by many. But to buy with a credit card from the US, they seem good. They have higher fees then others, but they are a legit company (as much as one can be) so YMMV

I was in a mining pool based out of the Prague.  Over about 6 - 8 months I mined and hold over 100 BTC.  With a gpu...  Different times.

I guess it would depend on your hardware wallet. But if you have your backup seed, you can load it into a new unit and have access to your coins.

So, not tax advice and this is most likely illegal and I'm not saying do this, but... 
Buy gold, silver, platinum online, many sell as cash price or even a discount if using btc to pay. (they don't like cc fees either) 
Take said metals, once it arrives to a local coin shop or coin show and collect cash at melt prices.  They won't report it, because they will resell and not report themselves. Also, I've been told trading gold, silver, etc for cash is a hard asset and not required to file paperwork since it basically cash for cash trade. 
YMMV
