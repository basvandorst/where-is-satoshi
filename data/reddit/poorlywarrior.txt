Does this suggest Bitcoin is a dinosaur amongst other coins? ��

It's that fine balance between asking ourselves "What if I die tomorrow?" and then asking "What if I don't?".

Right on the money, you elaborated beautifully.
I've made mistakes based on the mindset of tomorrow could be my last day, but as I've matured I increasingly ask myself what if I don't, and now I'm looking at ways to plant seeds to grow for the future, bitcoin being being a seed.

My thinking... It would be great to say that the bottleneck here is that not enough businesses are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment thus limiting the amount of places to spend Bitcoin and mass adoption.
Even if the opposite were true BTC needs to be at a stage where it can deal with millions of transactions in short time and be lighting fast in order to be used as a currency and to deal with on a mass scale. At the moment it seems it just isn't quite there yet, so at this point it's mostly used as a store of value.
Correct me if I'm wrong of course.

Do you think they'll back if/when the all time high is breached again?

This would damage the brand of the company?
