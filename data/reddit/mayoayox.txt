Now is a bad time to sell anything. Hold on til May, then cash out and never get back into this.
It was so encouraging seeing that you got your hands back on this little fortune!! Before reading the edits, I was sure the ‘Coin was lost permanently. Reddit is sooo good!!

Maybe for Android.

Thank you for posting your story here. As the oldest son of a single mom who recently transferred some funds into crypto, I relate to you and this story is encouraging.

That’s true for crypto too. Crypto is more similar to ForEx than it is to stocks. It’s more volatile, and holding on doesn’t make them increase or decrease in value.
Not to say that was or wasn’t your point, just piggybacking on what you said.

That seems related to the idea in trading of 24hr volume

Yeah fr Haha. I expect that stuff on IG, didnt expect it here on Reddit. Its whatever though, I'm not insecure. I got into this game a month ago, hes late to the party.

This is so spectacular!! (no pun intended)
Your daughter is gonna be so grateful for that one day, I hope BTC moons so that her investments help her pay for college or a house. It's so exciting introducing young people, the next generation, to the future. Keep her ahead if the curve!

Lol like 5 bucks. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:10:08
I love this. Do you do commissions? If I paid you upfront, would you put something up and put my qr code instead?
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:53:13
Yes! This is what I've been telling my friends. The bitcoin white paper is as revolutionary as the American Declaration of Independence.

Dang wish I had bought lol
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:37:07
This is cool but what's the point if you can buy it on your phone?
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:47:07
And I guess you have the option of storing to a paper wallet or a cold wallet, maybe..? that would make sense, I guess. My initial thought was that it sends the coin to you via your phone.

I mean, if the market is using it, it has value. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:10:38
This is good but ... well I guess when bitcoin goes way up the news will tell you so. Just dont miss the peak
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:03:57
