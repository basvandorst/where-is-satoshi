Id like to hear the logic behind this.

We could use a whitelist. The cloud of misinformation, fud, and fakery surrounding so many coins and tokens makes this an uphill battle. 
Not to mention how many exist right now.  
I'd love an app that literally goes through a checklist against all available currencies and spits out a traffic light colour. There do seem to be a small number of projects out there with some real world traction, but if I put my top five down I bet we couldn't agree on more than 20% of them.  
We need a cull of the trash.

That's quite a reply, thx for your time :)

yeh UK is a hard sell. I think we'll get there but it needs to be much easier to get into first. Im talking idiocracy proof.  
At the risk of repeating myself, I also think that leaving Europe could put us in a position where inflation becomes an issue in the UK. If inflation becomes an issue then the conversation about bitcoin gets easier.

OK. Some fair points tbh. It just feels like a matter of principle to avoid this. Having said that I've only had time to research about ten cryptos and I'm sure I'm going to find other scams out there. Just the bcash one feels so blatant.  
  
I think the point about accidently ending up with bcash is more about being mislead. If the very first thing I had bought was something pretending to be something else I'm not sure I'd still be moving forward with this.

Yeh. It was in fact only their wallet that let them down in the end. I was like 'bitcoin cashhh or bitcoin corrre? Who knew there were so many bitcoin?' 
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:37:08
Just the down vote would have told me that tbh. 
Cest la vie.

Used to play eve online. Heard about bitcoin right at the beginning in a game chat. Ignored it. Idiot. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:20:37
Looking, thx

He was just a man. A man with a talent for secure communication in the presence of a third party. Living an ordinary life, until one day.... the accident. Admitted to hospital with a long term condition he became....  
The Crypto Patient.

edited OP to reflect your answers, thanks for taking the time to respond :)

OK I'll bite. I bought my first bitcoin 20th July. The same day I downloaded the bcash wallet. 
Since then I've bought a hardware wallet, learnt about the block chain, and started to look at where alternate coins fit.  
I'm aware that there are several forks other than bcash. I'm also aware that none of the other forks advertise themselves as bitcoin, own bitcoin.com, or run a subreddit called r/btc. 
None of the others refer to actual bitcoin as 'bitcoin core'.  
  
So yes, in less than a month I have decided I don't like how bcash do business, and I don't want to support anyone that helps them continue to operate. 
In the end you will project your own beliefs about 'hidden agendas' etc. It's the Internet - if you don't want to believe me then don't :)

Yet another moron blurring the lines. 
Democratic socialism has yet to be tried, and is undoubtedly the best social model available to the world.  
This is 2018s version of 'damn commies'

hey. I bought my first 1.5 BTC a couple of days ago. I came into some money, paid off my debts, put some into a 2 year tax free saving, and the rest into BTC.  
  
The reason? i live in the UK. Recently the country has been steered into shit creek, and the paddles have long since gone overboard.  
  
I bought BTC because I am almost certain Brexit is going to be a financial disaster for a large number of people in the country. From my perspective BTC looks much better than US dollars. The common feeling here in the UK is that America is being run by a fucking lunatic so having dollars is pretty much the same as having pounds.  
  
just a little anecdotal evidence to support the idea that BTC appears to provide a safety net from the retarded decisions governments make - certainly enough for me to roll the dice.

Hi, newish person here. I'm happy with the underlying theories and ideas, and I'm in for as much as I can afford.  
  
What I want to know about are alt coins and how they fit into the picture, are any worth looking at? Any links to further info? Thx!   
  
cheers for the replies. im going to stick to 99% going to bitcoin. There are a couple of alts out there that seem to be trying interesting things so they can share the other 1%.

sure I can :)  
  
the post underneath that starts ''are you mental...'' pretty much sums up the UK right now. You have two camps of people that are literally never going to agree. We are talking a lifelong feud. So the country is (and will remain for generations) totally split.  
  
''Youths strongly favored Remain, with 75 percent of Brits 24 and younger reporting they voted for Britain to stay in the European Union, according to a YouGov poll.  
  
A majority of people age 25-49 also backed Remain, on 56 percent, while older voters preferred Leave, the poll shows''  
source:    
  
so effectively enough people will have died of old age by 2020 that if the vote was run again it would be in favour of Remain. Rose tinted glasses, and the idea that we can somehow become a powerhouse export nation again, making deals on our own terms like we did in the 1970s.  
The reality of course is that we are going from being a member of a huge trading bloc to a single entity with very little negotiating power. Personally I cant see a single scenario where we will get a better deal than the ones we already have.  
  
A sample of companies leaving the UK because of brexit:  
1. EasyJet  
2. Diageo  
3. Goldman Sachs  
4. Deutsche Bank  
5. Microsoft  
6. Smiffy’s  
7. Barclay’s  
8. Lloyd’s of London  
  
In fact the financial times predicts 1 in 7 companies will move their supply chain out of the UK. Several large car manufacturers have already jumped ship.

Immigration was used as a hot button issue during the respective Brexit campaigns. There was a huge amount of bad information/fake news in the public domain, and its still difficult to find good information because any info you do get is either from a leave or stay perspective, no one is pushing information marked ''neutral'' (although it does exist).   
  
As a sample though 1 in 8 workers in our national health service is non-British. The service is already in crisis because various powerful entities are desperately trying to make our healthcare model the same as the US one - and we all know how that ends. Couple of sources for you here:

since we are talking about currency, here are Lloyds current 3 year predictions:  
   
  
Obviously I am biased myself - i voted remain. I would love to be proved wrong in my analysis of the situation but the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to a disaster waiting to happen.  
Just in the last couple of months the media has covered stories such as ''Government buys processed food stocks - just in case'' , ''Holidays abroad are going to become hugely more expensive'' , ''Areas outside London will see cost of living rises averaging at 1%''.  
  
I am in the process of acquiring an Irish passport so I can remain part of the EU and leave the ship if necessary. Millions of people are not so lucky.
