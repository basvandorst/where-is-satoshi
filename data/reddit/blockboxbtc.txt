Very possible, and what recourse will you have? Is there any collateral backing the loans? Can you sue? Do you even know their real names? 
I got screwed on prosper.com, it is very, very easy to walk away from unsecured loans and no one cares, so be careful. 
Odd jobs, bitwage, create a company, these are better ways to increase your BTC.

Sorry this happened to you, check out these links:
Good luck!

Hahaha.. Dude, that is fucking awesome.

It has a balance of zero Bitcoins ($0).
So, the newsbtc, WaPo, and Chicago Tribune articles are all click bait and lies. ISIS would be pretty fucking stupid to use Bitcoin, this whole thing is bullshit and the media should be ashamed of themselves.

What's the point? We just did a stress test. We know the limits. 
A solution is forthcoming, everybody calm down.

There is an ATM up in PA, and mine is over the border in Sterling, VA, but i do not recommend paying off crypto-ransoms.  Hope those links helped.

That's not how it's going to work.

Not if the tx is part of a closed loop and/or you receive wages denominated in btc.

Like XBTeller, and until I activate 2-way, I will be happy to buy a reasonable amount of bitcoins from anyone.  Just reach out via email dmvbtc
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:24:09
Technically, it's not on a stool, but it sure looks like it.. we are exploring adding 2-way functionality with the Lamassu stand. Stay tuned!

Assuming you live in USA and file taxes properly, 
My advice to you is to spend the bitcoins on something you would buy with fiat already (gyft cards for target, spend on household goods), then replace the bitcoins you spent. 
What this does it is creates a taxable loss, and lowers your cost basis.  You keep 2 BTCs, but you get to write off the "capital loss" on taxes, and the btc you repurchase are now $235.  Don't just hoard btc. Use it, replenish it, wash rinse repeat.

This is something that I've researched as a potential for my company. The one caveat is having consistent internet access(especially in a city with tall buildings), but there are solutions out there using 4G/LTE which make is actually pretty feasible. I have field tested a Lamassu in the middle of a parking lot tethered to an ipad and it actually worked.

Funny. It is encouraging that it's been six weeks since the last death. RIP and long live bitcoin.

Resubmit the same transaction with a .0001 BTC fee. It should get picked up and the current one discarded.

do make a backup just in case your phone dies or gets lost.

This is the exact setup I want to run, is there a link to instructions?

what country are you from?
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:49:08
First of all, your opening statement is factually incorrect. We are not here to force bitcoin on anyone. It is here if anyone wants/needs to use it. Plain and simple.
And what, exactly, are you doing to help Greece/bitcoin? Go do something instead of being a keyboard warrior and troll. 
I learned very early on to never generalize when talking about a group of people. Very few are "reveling in the misery of others". Don't insult everyone due to the actions of a few. BTW, this subreddit doesn't run bitcoin.

airbitz IOS app works pretty well for importing private key. Not sure what you mean by "bought some paper wallets", a paper wallet should contain the public and private key.  you would scan the private key into the airbitz app.  Assuming you loaded the paper wallet with bitcoins, they should now be on your phone.

You would get the scam landlord to put his bitcoin address in writing(easy) and then you could always sign a message from your bitcoin wallet proving you own the wallet that sent $1000 on 9/15/2015 at 2:30 PM. 
In turn, Landlord could also turn around and say here is the address(signed) I ask scam tenant to pay, and as you can see, there is no payment.  
No need for middlemen.

Some transactions can be much larger than others, which reduces the throughput of the network by clogging the tubes.

Yes, this is nonsense, Merck &amp; Co shows up as owner of a lot of amazon cloud addresses in my experience. That's all they are going on here.  Why would a pharmaceutical company host websites? Ridiculous.

I was just down there tried to find the food truck. Couldn't find it... Then, the person working at the cafe didn't know how to process bitcoin so i paid with fiat and moved on.  It was a tough experience, but merchant solutions are still very new/difficult to grasp for most owners.  I do the same when I contract work out... I offer more in bitcoin than fiat. Good job!  
@_date: 2015-11-03 03:09:02
If you did hundreds of transaction, you would have a large number of change addresses and hence keys, but if you used the same address over and over then you'll have just a handful of keys.  You can use the debug window and the dumpprivkey command to get the private keys.  This is tedious if you have more than 10 addresses in that wallet.  
If it's not tens or hundreds of BTC, it would probably be safe to use bc.i.. i'm probably being harsh due to their random/extended downtime over the years.

GoUrl.io has the most usable product so far from my testing. It can be integrated with WooCommerce, and as ozme jokes below, it actually does take an electrum seed and deposits funds directly to the merchants local wallet. They charge 1.5% which isn't TOO bad, but we can build better and cheaper methods. I'm excited to read more about baron!  
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:01:03
"Who is Jamie Dimon?" - said everyone out here in the real world.
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:59:09
How many keys are we talking about?  a few or a lot? If just a few, then you can just dump them and sweep them(because  you cannot import them into the seed) into electrum wallet.
I've never used a wallet.dat file other than in Qt, so i'll leave that to someone with experience.
I would not use bc.i to import your wallet, but that is an option as well, but do so at your own risk! (don't do it) 
good luck!

Because I live in Virginia and Virginians are essentially barred from any of the actual innovations being made in bitcoinland.

You should use bitcoin where accepted because the merchant probably prefers it over CCs.
Those reward programs are great until the companies can't afford them anymore.  All they do is raise the costs of goods for poor people anyway(even more than the CC fees already do). 
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:37:17
The fee used to be .05 BTC until half way thru 2012.  Now it is .0001-2 or even as low as .00001.  So, the tx fees paid back there were quite large %-wise compared to today.
As the price has come down the fee has also gone down.  I don't think this will be a problem until way into the 2030s.  remind me then.

It's stuff like this that makes me appreciate the bitcoin community.  All he wants is pizza, WSJ.

.0001 is defaulted by many clients, however the true lowest transaction fee was .00001 for some time now. If you use Bitcoin-QT you can configure it as such. It is now .00005, or 5000 satoshis

Been playing with gourl.io lately and it works GREAT if you just want to keep BTC and not convert to fiat, however, I'm not cised about the 1.5% fees, should be more like .5% and it would gain more traction. 
For brick and morter, I think coinkite's terminal is the bee's knees at this point.

However, if you zoom out to 5 years, it's down 99.97%

Bitcoin Core? 
Patience, mostly. It is likely not stuck and is working behind the scenes. 
If you hover on the status bar on the bottom, it will show which block it is receiving, that should be jumping up every 15 seconds or so. 
You can also look at network statistics and see data coming/going. Try closing and restarting if it is stuck after all this. You may also want to download the latest client, make a backup of your wallet.dat first, of course.

They can't give you coins until the transfer from your bank clears. Too may fraudsters out there.
Alternatively, you can use a local BTM instantly if you are close to one:
