I don't use btc as a currency but as a store of value so for me it's quite usefull i think twice before using my money, and i do it only for good reasons.
As a currency i use fiat currency.

Being patient is the biggest quality of a bitcoin hodler, you should take your time and open a normal account to avoid the fees
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:17:45
It's not as if there was an alternative, what would i do with my money ? Put it in the dollar scam ? Na... i'll die with bitcoin if it dies
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:01:51
Lol, what if everyone who sells bitcoin come here to tell us his life ?
Very good idea, you're smart, have fun, be happy, i guess it's what you wanted to hear :)

If you're looking for profit bitcoin is not the answer. If you're looking for freedom it is
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:57:12
Yes it's only a question of guessing... which grain of sand is the good one...
Some people tried, still looking for it, and may spend their lifetime doing so. I sincerely hope they will find it, but i doubt

It's wall street mentality, bitcoin people don't think this way

Thx for roger ver, he's already a millionaire but he needs more

No matter, i just want to have some bitcoin lovers point of view about that, because it runs more and more into my mind
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:24:41
The first thing i wish i knew : hodl /
The second thing : if you don't hodl, never sell during the dip, sell high or keep hodling /
The third thing : hodl

I'm from france, so just asking. Is a 529 really secure ? What if the dollar collapses ? I'm very surprised because if i had to invest for my children futur i would be more confident with bitcoin than with fiat money or any state controlled plan.
Though, nice story, you seem to be a good parent and that's probably THE main security for your son, even more than bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:00:11
Buying and hodling has always been and will always be the best strategy
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:12:15
For a short time you can keep them on coinbase, but learn how to keep them at home. It also depends on the amount, as the fees are high don't move small amounts of btc

No it will be emmanuel macron, but probably in 2018

Interresting, thx

Btc sometimes crashes, then it comes back, but it's hard to deal with it if you're new in it, you'll probably panic sell a loose a lot of money, we all have to go through this

Listen to everything andreas antonopoulos says, he's the mvp in that game

First time i bought btc was in 2013, at 500, then it went to 200... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:56:09
I guess it's the minimum fluctuation on the bet. If the btc price is 6000, you can bet it will be at least 6025 or 5975

Lol, gg

It's future contracts based on bitcoin price, it allows institutionnals to bet on the futur price of btc without having to buy btc. It's used for quiet everything, oil, corn, shares... it's a way for investors to protect themselfs from price volatility. Trillions of dollars are invested in futurs, and they all look at btc growth with stars in the eyes but till there is a futur contract they are not allowed to invest on it because it's not secure enough.
Sorry if i'm not clear enough, it would be easier for me me to explain such a technical issue in french :)

He'es already billionaire, i don't think he cares. But showing him respect and calling him bitcoin jesus seems fair

nobody can withdraw btc from their platform, i guess it's the way they deal with that problem ^^
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:24:31
have you seen all the people asking for support before they close the trollbox ? Some of them waiting for weeks to get their btc or just to get an answer...
I'm in btc since 2012 because i hate beiing f***ed by institutions, in 2012 i was being called a troll/conspirationist for criticising central banks and quantitative easing...
And as i went through mtgox scam i tell young investors about strange things i see in the cryptomarket. If that's a troll attitude then i'm more than a troll, you can call me an ork ;)
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:22:21
last time i saw a platform behaving that way it was called mtgox...
