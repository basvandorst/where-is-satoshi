Ah, the excitement has gotten the better of me. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:04:45
Correct, but miners are still going to switch to where it's more profitable for them. With bcashes EDA this is just going to form infinitely reducing difficulty (likely on both chains) as hashrate moves back and forth, until a fix is made.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:00:17
half of what exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:59:46
Yeah, for a day. Since nobody is actually using it it's not a problem. Then it's back to 30 blocks/hour.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:24:52


It already adjusted when segwit activated, as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:30:32


I don't need to do anything, I don't give a shit about bcash. I'm happy they're forked off and I'll let the market decide - if the crash and burn that's fine with me, and if they don't that only makes me richer. I think their way of handling this is wrong but you got to try different options sometimes and see what works and what doesn't.
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:46:34
eclair wallet is amazing but it's not really what lightning is all about as it's using a single, direct payment channel.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:32:34


I just want to point out that this is making transactions smaller, not increasing the block size - a very different approach to "on chain scaling", if you can even call it that.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:13:11


I'm saying that it's not possible to have *all* the addresses with non-zero amounts.


@_date: 2017-08-31 16:35:43
u/nullc could help here.
 Why would you say that the new state is "false"? If a re-org happens the new chain has more work and as such is the correct chain to follow.

Agreed 100%. I just wanted to point that out to those that might not know that, because this is not at all how bcash is doing ~~online~~ on chain scaling and it's how it should be done.

Not necessarily. We have 4 nvidia gtx 1070's and 2 gtx 1080 at our firm, that are mostly not used so we started mining. Made around $600 last month alone for about $100 in electricity costs.

Pretty sure Warren Buffett would disagree with someone being 100% in gold as well.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:50:05
A lot of people speak of gold as in it being a stable investment, but one look at the price over the last decade pretty much tells the exact opposite. It might be a "stable" investment over thousands of years, but it definitely is not for the duration of our lifetime and as such is definitely not appropriate for the majority of the funds to be in.

A large percentage of mining power moving to bcash also isn't helping things.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:41:20
that's a common misconception. the chain with the most work matters, as others have already pointed that out to you.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:07:09
exactly. In fact it's best to set sell targets (up and down) before you invest into anything and stick to that. Of course you don't have to sell everything all at once. Investing based on emotional decisions like it seems majority of bitcoiners do is a very bad idea.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:42:28
Ah america, the best country in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:36:40
If I'm not mistaken bcash difficulty should adjust in about 450 blocks or so (at the current rate in about 12 hours) - after that most of the hash power should switch back to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:58:22
You're getting the same result but you're not putting more stress on the network.

There have been several reports that the intermediary they use for usd transfers is causing problems. It all works fine with eur so I doubt it's a problem on their end.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:26:00
It all depends on how much you're willing to lose. You're asking for advice and my (moderately conservative) advice (that panned out *really* well for me, might I add) is to split 1:3.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:29:50
the next difficulty (now reached) is only a bit higher than the last adjustment a few days ago, and that readjusted down within a day. why would it be any different now?

Not really. Could've been his sources' sources' source. 99% sounds more accurate.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:18:27


It's actually not, because the amount of satoshis is very likely much, much less than the amount of addresses available.


If this were to happen all the addresses would be contained in the blockchain.

longer chain doesn't matter, the chain with the most work does. You can mine a gazillion block with your mobile and that will only have the work of a few blocks on the actual network.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:50:21


It went from $1900 to $1200 in the last five years. Saying it won't lose value is pure speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:49:42
There's no way around it - the fee is too small. You can use CPFP if you need it to confirm that badly - otherwise it's going to be confirmed sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:16:23
well i hope you're right withthe prediction but i'm sure it wont take more than a day, like the last time bcash difficulty was at 30% btc.

Why would it? This is just going to keep happening.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:17:00

It's kind of funny every time i say i sold something here people are telling me how i *should* feel disappointed. I was taught to invest with a goal in mind and i have always stuck with the decisions that were made well in advance, i have never in my life made a financial decision based on emotions. It has worked out extremely well for me. Thinking about a lost opportunity like you're saying gains you nothing - and it was probably a lost opportunity for a reason.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:00:53
the price might drop but the eda will just trigger enough times that it will become more profitable to mine anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:47:16
So they mined *one* block an hour and a half ago and nothing since.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:32:31
thanks for correcting me, that is indeed amazing. I am really amazed how well it works (even if it were only over a single channel) and I can't wait to try it on mainnet. Thanks for all the hard work!
BTW i have one channel that won't close at all for about a month jow - it says it's in closing uncooperative state - what's up with that?

Let's say there's a 2mb block made, and your spv client gets it. To the client it all checks out, but it has no idea the block is actually invalid.
Until fraud proofs are sorted out this will continue to be a problem. Just because it's unlikely to happen it doesn't mean all is fine and dandy with spv clients. I fully agree with u/luke-jr here, if there's a chance a client is following an otherwise illegal chain then, ultimately, it's not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:39:28


Absolutely, you can consider your private keys known to anyone with a (capable general purpose) quantum computer. I predict bitcoin (as well as most other stuff) will switch to quantum resistant cryptography long before quantum computers are a real threat.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:37:23
Pretty sure SPV clients are much, *much* more widely used.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:55:02
What exactly do you think this exploit does? Because I don't think we mean the same thing.
The exploit referenced in the thread crashes nodes with not enough memory. It has nothing to do with a block containing only few transactions, that is by design and has always been possible.
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:27:21
Correct. Pretty sure electrum is spv as well as it downloads the block headers, if I'm not mistaken - it just gets the data from a server rather than from nodes directly.
edit: [yup, Proof Checking Electrum Wallet verifies all the transactions in your history using SPV.](
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:28:35

Next time set targets before you buy, like
* will sell if btc reaches $6000
* will sell if btc reaches $3000
and stick to those. Making emotional decisions is how you lose money.

@_date: 2017-09-12 11:06:08


He's talking about the fee. (Most) transactions are greater than 200 bytes, so you can absolutely make a transaction with a fee less than 1 satoshi/byte.

How does that matter? They accepted bitcoins, I paid with bitcoins. What they did after is none of my business. In the end it's more convenient for me and I don't have to deal with (potential) credit card theft, I think that's very important.
I'll expand a bit further - when you're in europe, you can't use usd to pay anywhere, and if you can it's first converted to euros - does that mean you can't pay with usd? Does it mean usd is not a currency in europe but just in the usa?
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:09:22


Maybe it's bitstamp, which recently started using segwit addresses and has (presumably) already been using multisig addresses in the past.
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:42:06
Hopefully, it would be best for bitcoin in the long run, the FUD around china all the time is unreal.

You already have 2.5 btc, which is about 10% of your portfolio - what I would consider a healthy investment into a volatile thing as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:26:29


Of course they never run out of bitcoins, because for every bitcoin bought there's a person selling one. It's a 1:1 match, these aren't "new" bitcoins that are given out.
This doesn't mean there are always people willing to sell/buy - look at the decentralized exchange for proof.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:30:30
Why would you close the payment channel immediately after making a transaction? That defeats the point entirely. They aren't open indefinitely but they can be opened as long as both parties are willing to keep it open, which can be a long time.
I personally can't wait to start using it when it's available.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:08:41
I don't and I don't care, exactly because the merchant pays for them. I'll use whatever is cheaper for *me*, not for the merchant.

Where is this pub?
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:16:06
Sure, but my local beer shop doesn't give me a discount if I pay with bitcoin just because they don't have to pay anything, so in the end that is more expensive for me. I gladly paid 10 cent fee every time we went to get a few beers to be able to use bitcoin, but now the fee is 10 times that and it's getting a bit expensive.

bip91 is already locked in and in full effect so there's no point in signaling for it anymore - it can in fact be dangerous to do so because those bits can be reused to signal for something entirely different in the future.
bip91 was signaled on bit 4, sw is signaled on bit 1, meaning anyone that has 2 (or 3, as a matter of fact) in the last digit of version field is signaling for sw. the ...12 means they're signaling on *both* bit 1 and 4, so for sw *and* bip91.

The whole bitcoin security really depends on pretty minimal amount of code - as such if there was a security hole it would've been found by now. The easiest way is probably breaking ECDSA, and if anyone did that bitcoin would be the least of your worries.

Ugh, I stand corrected, I honestly didn't notice. They are exactly the same commits OP posted in his jpg so I never thought anything of it. It's still true however that those segwit removing commits date back to April even on the master branch, is it not?

If it's income (payment for services or mining) then you pay tax on that as any income, at the price you get it, but there is no capital gains tax for bitcoin so if you buy and sell at a profit you don't pay anything.

Most of us don't give a shit about these kind of accusations. What we do give a shit about however is all the misleading and incorrect bullshit CW has been spewing.
What he's frequently been doing is preparing by reading a few vaguely related technical papers and using that in his talks, hoping nobody will actually go verify. Two examples of this from the top of my head are the "lightning can always be attacked because any network with more than 3 hops can be attacked" and how "malleability is a feature and can be solved with self signing signatures".

Yes. They can already remove signatures. They also don't have to verify any of them, but of course they risk such a block being ignored by others. As long as there's not 51% of mining power colluding they really can't do anything bad, and if that were to happen they can do much worse.

I will reword because it seems you're not reading things to the end:

Segwit is absolutely a block size increase, because transactions are still as they were. The only difference is that the block limit metric is changed from limiting raw bytes to limiting by weight, where singatures weigh less than the rest of the transaction - and this is all set up in such a way a block is at *least* as big as it is now.

Definitely not with you. I just came to point out to the person you've called an idiot that it's pointless to try to discuss anything with you.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:37:02
Let's be honest, you deserved that ban.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:53:41
The support seems to be a lot more responsive here on reddit. I personally have never had a problem with them.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:22:54
For sure, especially when his net worth is bigger than bitcoin's market cap.

Probably by losing money.

What does this have to do with OP's post? It's purely technical and has nothing at all to do with economics.
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:28:41
Interesting, i've never seen that. Where is this option, I don't see it in the tools menu?
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:50:32
Yeah, people are ridiculous here (and more so on r/btc) in this regard.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:07:31
Absolutely, all empty accounts.
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:25:57
I have never had a problem with kraken in europe - apart from their website being slow, but that's a minor inconvenience.
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:51:20
Of course you are, sweety.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:35:12
Absolutely. *eye roll*
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:20:11
Yes, you can use several other wallets that support trezor, like electrum or mycelium. I have been using electrum from day 1, only used trezor.io to update the firmware.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:18:02
I am perfectly satisfied with Trezor, it works painlessly with electrum. Also had Ledger hw.1 and that was also very good.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:48:21
If that's what you have to tell yourself to feel superior, absolutely!

I can confirm I had no problems withdrawing eur (inside eu) last week.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:17:16
Keep trying, it's going to work at some point.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:10:13
I've had good experiences with kraken. I would definitely suggest a hardware wallet though.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:06:31
I don't agree. I understand it but am still not comfortable putting any meaningful percentage of my portfolio in it - not because I think there's anything wrong with it, in fact I think it's pretty great and it's only going to get better but because price is determined by the free market and that is way too easily manipulated and with way too many stupid people.
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:43:59
Just ignore u/pokertravis next time. He likes to feel superior and brings economics in every discussion no matter of how little relevance it has, he does that here and on bitcointalk.org. If you continue having a discussion with him he starts throwing random articles at you and then ridiculing you for not wanting to read them. He's just a salty, sad little sack of shit, so ignore.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:26:11
We do, because he's filthy rich and we are all envious.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:15:02
True, but I'll still take a painless experience over nice charts any day.

Most wallet software is opensource, so that wouldn't work.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:13:30
They can. In fact when there was a bug with BU implementation and the majority of those nodes crashed what was left was most likely core nodes spoofed as BU.
You should take the numbers with a grain of salt but there is really bo point in signaling for something you don't actually support.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:39:16
If you got a seed to back up when you created it then it's deterministic - meaning everything is derived from that seed and that is the only thing that needs to be backed up, ever.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:46:34
You need a full UASF node, not a full core node. If you have that then you're already signaling for UASF, and if you don't and don't plan to actually run UASF node then there's no point in signaling with uacomment.

Edit: If I made a grammatical error - english is not my first language.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:37:11
Honestly it's incredible what kind of bullshit people here have to say in order to feel superior.

Inside job, keylogger, or a bunch of other possibilities on hashnest's side.

Ah, I've never traded on margin so I wouldn't know about that.

It really doesn't. The number of passwords up to 29 characters is only a drop in the bucket compared to the number of passwords of length 30.
The number of passwords of length 30 single-case alphanumeric characters is [97% of all passwords of length up to and equal 30](

I'm not from US but in my experience KYC on bitstamp is much much harsher than on kraken.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:49:33
I don't think P2PK is actually still supported in any of the wallets, so you don't have to worry about that. Also p2pk doesn't use addresses.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:48:26
This should be higher. Those mean absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:48:34




Sure, honey.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:20:58
Because it is, for the majority of your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:09:22
This is the correct way to invest - small investments are usually the most risky and as such will contribute to a high chunk of the profits.
I'll expand a bit on the first part - the main percentage of your portfolio should always be properly diversified by geography, currency, etc. but as you get older this should be in lower risk investments - meaning that at 20 yo this should mostly be stocks and at 60 yo this should mostly be bonds and fiat.

I am so glad i'm not a us citizenen.

This is the disagreement. Blocksize is very clearly defined in bytes and as such blocksize with segwit is absolutely always as big or greater than it is right now.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:46:56
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:49:49
Of course you did, darling.

It's probably because you're not forcing bitcoin down other people's throats. He posted "under [this thread](

How would you know it's a segwit address?
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:42:36
kraken works just fine if a little slow, still a lot better than bitstamp where you're grilled for every tiny transaction.
