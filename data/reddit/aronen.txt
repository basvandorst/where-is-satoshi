What is it with all these people willing to eat their genitals if bitcoin reaches x amount?

Looks more like the Himalayas to me.

Hate to break it to you buddy, but if you waited a few more weeks you could've bought a garage full of lambos with those coins.

I hope it will rise this time

Moon? Haven't even made it past stratosphere yet.

It's neither of those, Bitcoin is non-binary.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:02:47
The price seems to be a tad off.

Patience you must have, my young padawan.

Dying is the ultimate state of hodling.

I feel like we need a new cryptocurrency specifically tailored for porn industries. All aboard the wankcoin train?

If one satoshi were $10, a bitcoin would be worth $1 billion. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:38:41
What's that g-spot in the middle?
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:26:04
I have a dream.

From 100 to a 0 real quick

Still selling panties? My friend was asking, he'd like to buy some.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:58:52
Diversify, don't keep all eggs in one basket. Look up and compare different altcoins that have unique features and great potential, and invest in those as well. Then just hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:39:04
[Hodl the line!](
