Apart from the US, most 1st world countries don't use checks anymore - they still exist, to some degree, but they're not used much. Besides, non-domestic payment options are limited to cashier's checks, wire transfers or online services. Most use bank wire transfers, which are slow, expensive, and subject to the individual bank's rules - e.g. transfers being frozen until the bank is satisfied with the information offered about the transaction.

You can do that in the Ledger app, no need for Electrum. But then he'd have to calculate the fee himself, which he presumably would be doing already if he knew how. The problem is that the fee calculation algorithms are wonky. Same for Bitcoin Core, even though the fee calc stuff got patched recently.

I assume you mean blockchain.info, which is a web service. BreadWallet is a software wallet. Lots more info here:

If you're on android, Mycelium is a decent wallet. On IOS you can use BreadWallet. Both are personal wallets where you are responsible for backup etc, but you control your keys and hence your money. Using a mobile wallet leaves you at the mercy of the company who owns the service. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:59:39
The OP suggests that the miner end game is increased block rewards, not (only) higher fees. I'd argue that it's about control.

Yes, as long as you get your private keys from the bitcoin.com wallet you can swipe/import them into any wallet.

According to Trace Mayer (good talk:  the miners are the least important part of the ecosystem, as their work is only valuable because of all the other participants. In as such, they're only big players because they have access to lots of bitcoin, not because they're miners.

You have to lock up 1k dash to operate a 'master node', which can theoretically earn you fees. I think this is what Jihan is referring to. You can move your coins at any time, which revokes the master node status. There's some other stuff to avoid sybiling, but I won't get into that here.

The device does not run on batteries. The coins are not stored on them, the private keys are, and you get a mnemonic seed you can back up any way you like. It's **much** safer than a paper wallet.
