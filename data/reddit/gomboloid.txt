This depends on who you ask. But if you ask me, the answer is a resounding no. I think there's way, way way more room to go.
Most intelligent adults think bitcoin is ridicuolous. It _might_ be too late once most intelligent adults grudgingly admit that they were wrong on bitcoin, but even then, i don't think it'd be the case. 
At that point, people won't call it "investing in bitcoin", they'll just call it "saving" which is a thing people used to do before money was ruined by printing way too much of it.

I expected this kind of future spike which is why I kept buying them after the crash of 14.
Lots of folk like me did. Well keep buying.

i've been wondering the same thing.
the 401k/ira availability could be the key thing: i can do this with my roth ira, so i don't need to worry about taxes.

You can make tipping optional. Bitcoin upvotes are worth more  than nonregistered votes. Downvotes cost you 10x. 
Or you could just take the data from the blockchain and interpret it however you want. People who don't like you will ignore all of your submissions, regardless of how much money you give away. People who like you will read all of them, regardless of how much money you give away.

do you value history?  if you think history is helpful for people, you should support bitcoin.
corrupt people and organizations are always trying to change the past. they delete and modify historical records to hide their crimes. anyone who values history suffers as a result.
bitcoin is powered by the blockchain, which is a **permanent public record** that cannot be censored or edited to please people who'd rather history weren't a real thing.
the more successfull bitcoin is, the people can become aware of this amazing thing. it is a revolution in trust; nothing like the blockchain has ever existed before. if there were no money involved, people would be screaming from the rooftops that we could finally have a public record everyone can trust.

i'm not really sure where that notion of 'reputation' comes from.  people will still judge you, and it's not like you can walk around all day being like 'hey, here's an audit that shows i didn't pay for my degree' - that just makes you look worse.
people judge each other for all kinds of things, some of which make sense and some of which are ridiculous. there's lots of things other people can do to fuck up your reputation. certainly this doesn't mean you yourself have no control.

i've been trying to explain how bitcoin works to people. educating them on how to use it isn't enough - imo. they need to understand things like the blockchain to really see the value.
to me, the idea of a shared data store that nobody can fuck with - it's amazing! it's like the biggest thing in human history in terms of enabling trust! it's... i just can't talk about the blockchain enough, and what it means for transparency, for open government, for truth and science and fucking history!
if there were no money involved, people would be shouting from the rooftops about the blockchain  - but then if there were no money involved, it wouldn't be so hard to break.
here's a [post i wrote on fb]( to explain bitcoin to people. maybe i'll work on it more and republish it.

to add on: if shorting weren't possible, what do you do in this situation? you sell coins if you have them, but if you don't have coins,  and you know for a fact that something bad is going to happen to bitcoins, you can't signal that reliably to the market.
when shorting is possible, it tells people "this market can be signaled in both directions." when shorting is impossible, it's much harder to tell whether you're in a circlejerk or the real deal. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:25:11
don't explain bitcoin, explain the blockchain. a permanent public record that anyone can contribute to and no government, company, or connected person can remove entries from, is obviously valuable. 
once they  say 'hey such a thing would be nice but it'll never happen', explain that it already exists, and bitcoin is what makes it possible.

i know there are huge challenges. they certainly aren't "done" yet. it just seems very likely that they will succeed. i got my college friend an in there, and he's been busting his ass since then. the thing is, the company would have succeeded without me working hard. clearly - it did. so i could have stayed there and not really known whether my success - and it would have 10's of millions at the latest valuation - was something i 'earned' - or whether i had just picked an winner and was along for the ride. 
i'm not trying to criticize anyone else's choice; i just don't think it was for me. i think i'm happier now having learned what it was like to lead a smaller company that ultimately failed, instead of being an early player in one that eventually did well.

i was an early uber employee - like number 9 or 10. i don't remember which.  i was in the office in june 2011 during the   '$30 bubble' - and we talked about it a lot. since most of those guys are still there, i think there's a good shot it'll be picked up.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:09:13
i got an offer to be CTO of a gaming startup. i moved to the bay area to do the startup thing, and i figured that would be more fulfilling.
i knew uber would be huge, and having worked in finance early in my career, knew i wouldn't react well to having huge amounts of money that i didn't feel i'd 'earned.' uber was such an obvious winner in my mind; "picking a winner" that would succeed regardless of whether i worked hard or not felt like a lame way to get rich. of course i'd love to have that much money, but i know if i got it that way, i wouldn't feel like i earned it and it'd make a lot of things harder for me, socially speaking.
i don't regret leaving.

how about just a list of addresses whos owners say 'i'm in for this.' the addresses are posted on a public website, and anyone who wants to can check to see who has participated and for how long. it'd be a good yardstick of how much trust there is in bitcoin. A lot of people doing this on a regular basis for a long time would convey a bunch of trust to it.

travis recruited me heavily to join uber. the first offer they made me (august 2010) would have brought me in as number 5 or so; the options would be worth over $100M then. i liked travis, but didn't trust the ceo at the time.
when travis took over for that ceo (graves), i joined uber. we had a pretty good relationship;  right after i joined, i got this offer to be CTO once the money came in, and i told travis right away. he was cool with it.
he does see himself in an egotistical light, but honestly you'd have to in oder to do what he's done. if you have doubts about yourself, everyone will tear you down. you have to be almost ridiculously full of yourself to think this is possible.
i'm still fb friends with the early people at uber, and one of my best buddies from college joined after i got him the interview. he's still there, managing a team of managers now, and he's really stressed but happy about what's going on in his life.
when i was there, i was super addicted to weed and smoked every day, usually around 4:20 - and then came back to the office. i had a reputation for being weird, wild, but interesting. for a year or so after i left, whenever i went to party with my friend that was still there, people at uber would be like 'oh wow, you're is gomboloid? i've heard about you!
for a while, fucking up the git repo was called 'pulling a gomboloid'. 
i left uber and was cto of my own game company that had some small success, with an exit that gave me no $$ and left me with the 40k in credit card debt i'd wracked up thinking the exit would give me a couple hundred grand. i crashed hard; 5 stays in a mental hospital in a 12 month period (2012).  i made it through, though - got a great job, and a woman i dated years ago (2008) came back into my life right before the crash, helped me through, and is now my fiance. we get married in a month.
so no, i don't have $80 million, but i have friends who stuck with me while i was losing my mind, paid off $50k in debt (credit card, medical) in less than a year, beat the addiction i'd struggled with for four years (haven't smoked in 7 months, thanks largely to my girl and married a girl i've known for years while i bounced from woman to woman, learned how better to trust people, read emotions, manage my own emotions, save money (you have to when you're in debt, not so much when you have millions) lost weight, and largely come to peace with the way money functions in the world and the moral responsibility i'd have if i were in possesion of a bunch of it.  money is power. most people agree on this. with great power comes great responsibilty. most people agree on that. most people also seem to think that lots of money frees you from your responsibilities, and i've never felt that way. 
i think travis will do well for himself too. it's easy to underestimate him - although i do agree he'd do better to improve the public image.

[10], eh?
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:20:15


there are plenty of ways. if 10 of my friends say 'hey, this guy is the same person', i'll trust them over a bunch of newly created accounts. 
if i see users posting things repeatedly which i like, i'll friend them and put more weight behind their donations, too. 
** edit**  i realize what i'm proposing is not common knowledge or thought about much. i also realize that the bitcoin part isn't what enables this to work. distributed trust systems are worth looking into, though.

they provide a reliable signal: a person giving money to someone else values that content. if someone i trust claims "bitbubbly is the same person as b0tbubbly", i can filter self-donations out too.

i suppose you could question my judgement here, but that would presume you know me better than i do.
money isn't everything. of course i'd love tons of money, but having a bunch of money and feeling like "i didn't earn this" wouldn't do me any good; it'd make my life much harder.
i learned all kind of things which you cant learn if you have a ton of money, because you won't be afraid of failure and won't have the same incentive to try. 
i was also late to the 'learn about people' phase of life, and i'm sure it'd be much harder to learn about people when you had tons of 'new friends' and had no idea who you could trust because of how much money you had.  hitting rock bottom can be invaluable because it can show you who you can really trust if you do make it big. there are people in my life who never left me even though i risked dragging them down. 
i have a sense of certainty that if everything in my life is gone - whether because i squandered it or because it is taken from me - i'll be able to get back on my feet, because i've done it so many times.
a wealthy man can never buy those things. someone who got wealthy by joining an early stage startup can never know if he could build one of his own without tons of money behind it, while afraid of failing and being poor. he'd have to give up his fortune to do that.
i've seen a lot of boats go by in my time. i've ridden a few long enough to see the emptiness in wealth that's given to you. i'd much rather build a dinghy than catch a ride on someone else's yacht.  i built one, it floated for a while, and it was much more rewarding than going for a ride on a much bigger boat that i didn't build and wasn't captain of.

it's impossible to really know what the people buying shorts are betting on.
perhaps they really think it should be worth less than it is now. perhaps they think they can bring the whole thing down.
i'm not anti shortseller; i think whoever originally posted this is operating under the mindset that there are a lot of people shorting bitcoin who just want to see it fail. i don't think it's an unreasonable hypothesis.

This has to do with shorting. It doesn't apply in reverse.
If each of us just puts in 10$/day and ignores the coins, the price will go up like crazy.

I built a tool to automate DCA because of this exact problem.
This tool let you dollar cost average automatically, without paying any transaction fees using the coinbase pro api.  Everything is fully automated; it buys for me and a few other people every day, and we pay nothing in fees. Eventually I want to charge a small fee to use the site, maybe something like $40/year, but as of now, everything is totally free.

Yep. Makes it far easier to just ignore prices and focus on stacking sats.
