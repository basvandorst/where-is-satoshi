If it ever reaches $0.01 I will give you all my BTC for free.

I thought Paypal took a percentage rather than a set fee?

If it works like any normal auction the buyers identity doesn't have to be made public, it's optional. Don't know if it's different with seized assets but can't see why it would be.

He talked about that on the SR forums shortly after his arrest last year; he said that everything he did was above board with receipts and records.

Yes, everyone can share both my coins to offset any losses they are facing.

I'm British and I wouldn't trust me.

Either way we now know the coins are there and not stolen. Gives a LOT of hope to the people wanting to settle this through courts, even if Mark isn't preparing to return them in a honourable way.

He wasn't the only forum admin though was he? And the popular theory at the time, as to why the forums stayed up, was that they were hosted elsewhere and possibly hadn't been compromised. So if it was a member of his own team, they could have been going in to delete evidence before LE could.

And when SilkRoad was taken offline the US government seized 170,000 bitcoins and sold them at auction for peanuts compared to current prices. Hindsight is a beauty. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:06:24
I'm not sure venders will dare cash out their BTC yet but yeah, this is going to have a potentially large impact on prices.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:14:49
The general consensus right now is that Ross is talking to get a reduced sentence. Backed up by 3 of his Silk Road staff being arrested last week, who he had personal details of. If he's preparing to sell everyone out and plead guilty I guess trying to fight for his btc back is worth a try, no matter how incredibly unlikely. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:25:05
Yeah true, I agree. My first thought was that between the hundreds of venders who are turning over a huge amount of money; they must be sat on a rather large volume of incriminating btc.
@_date: 2013-03-06 12:57:14
Think it's a bit of both. The amount of users in going through the roof, you only have to look at the the vendor page of any popular dealer to see how many people are finalising within a 24 hour period. It's crazy.
Any dealer not cashing out their coins over the last few months is going to be doing well. Very well.

Bubbling like the soluble drugs it's being used for.

If the average Joe, living in the US, is having problems buying coins then it's a big problem for everybody not just him. 
It's kind of funny that Bitcoins are being seen as a threat to banks but right now; it's the other way around.
@_date: 2013-09-05 11:10:34
Looking at the quality of some of the older posts on there, it looks like someone could be using/selling guest blog posts. Usually done for SEO link-building purposes.
@_date: 2013-02-12 11:07:35
I don't think that there is much resistance for $30, it'll be there by the end of the week the way it's going. 
Can only see it then crashing back down to around $15-20 because this growth is just unnatural and unsustainable.

If you live in the UK, they have been for a while.

I'm sure some people would, it doesn't mean they are right though. Whether he used bitcoin or not, I think most sensible people believe in a trial before conviction.
@_date: 2013-03-05 09:16:06
What the fuck. It went from 37.8 to 40.5 in little over 2 hours.

Not saying this has been hacked but if someone wanted to stick that post up, they wouldn't have to hack ebays servers at all. This is just a Wordpress blog. A lot of Wordpress blogs do have security flaws, especially if they aren't upgraded often or use 3rd party plugins. Really not that difficult to get into.

I've used a guy off bitcointalk.org called bitcoinfridge - 
Last time from submitting a request form to having the coins in my wallet took less than 25 mins. He charges +2.5% on mtgox current price.
@_date: 2013-03-01 12:12:18
There certainly are a small amount of venders who sell cheap low quality products but any vender selling mid-high quality generally charges 10-20% more than street prices. In the UK I'd say weed prices are about 20-30% more on the road. Guess some of this is used to cover scam buyers, vender account fee, postage, vacuum sealers etc.
Overall though, yes I would say people are turning over an enormous profit.
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:28:52
With all of them coins buying a new passport from SilkRoad 2.0 shouldn't be a problem.

Bit weird that no other blog posts on deals.ebay.com are using a CDN, if that were the case.
Edit: Proven wrong by is4k - still a bit strange how 99% of the images/css/java don't use a CDN though.

Maybe most people would prefer to wait until a person is found guilty before calling them a murderer.
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:27:52
Exactly. I have seen a number of venders who either didn't even use pgp or had messages saying that it was coming soon, once they figure it out.
At the very least all venders, after paying their fee, should be given a checklist of security which they should comply with before being approved.

The main link is to a fetish porn site. Not sure where you work but if that is safe viewing, you are in the minority.

SR does have a backup wallet feature where all users who put in a backup address will get their BTC back if an admin is able to hit the switch. Too early to tell if that will happen though.
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:38:33
Would making it open source also make any exchanges built on the code more vulnerable to security issues?
And would we end up with people running exchanges who don't fully understand how their own site works from a technical perspective?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:13:09
You keep saying that you have no regrets but that just means you've got enough money to not care about taking a loss. Good for you but it doesn't make it any less of a bad decision right now, no matter how far you bury your head. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:27:36
Too easy to dismiss it as a faction of the world. It's got the second most internet users of any country by a long distance. The difference between coins being easily available in the US or not is gigantic.

It's a free UK newspaper and goes out to 1.3 million people everyday, so this is great coverage. Despite being free, it is actually fairly decent quality.
The Metro is owned by the same people who run the Daily Mail which is one of the biggest newspapers in the UK, it would be nice if they ran a story on it too.

Bitcoin in the only currency used on the SilkRoad.
