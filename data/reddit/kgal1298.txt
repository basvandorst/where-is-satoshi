The ones for parties have to be. I was watching some Dropshippers and they were like "Yeah I was going to go to the mansion party, but there was an issue with the venue and they wouldn't let me in unless I was over 21" umm if it was his property and his party and he insured the venue and made sure to check for ID then this wouldn't have mattered. I'm sure most of his mansion parties are at rented mansions. I wonder where he really lives. Either that or he's on short term leases in the Hills you can get leases for weeks or months at a time. I'm sure he's bringing in some money, but it's just annoying how he sells people on this.

He's selling credit repair now. LMAO I hope to god people don't listen to him there's about 100 other financial experts they should go to before they go to him.

He sells knowledge that he knows is free online, but still chooses to sell it to people who don't know any better or just don't have the time to research. I noticed the same thing in the dropship community where more people are making more money selling their "knowledge" than they are actually dropshipping. Ughhhh Tai Lopez annoys the crap out of me and it sucks so many people look up to him.

Hahaha so my bf does Credit Repair and I saw Tai is now doing Credit Repair and shilling it by showing a guy that has like a 3 million dollar credit line. That's now how that works your credit line is based on income we all know this and it's annoying he really does jump on all the trends to make courses on them and his courses just rehash info you can get for free out there.
