Sure everyone has different preferences. I was just tired seeing negative posts without critique that actually refers to the content (BitAsset mechanics)....

And all that with the average miner mining at home? :)

I think we should carefully distinguish. Only because in both cases it says "peg" it can still be a totally different mechanism to reach parity.
That is like saying E-Gold didn't work, let's stop all that internet currency bullshit!

It is true that there is no Counterparty risk in holding a BitAsset. There is of course one for the time until you get the BitAsset.... The article I linked above clearly talks about the risks involved. Counterparty risk in the sense that a central party could default on what is backing BitAssets (like with an exchange where you have USD or BTC or with services like Bitreserve or CoinUSD) is not one of them though.

How does a crypto currency with price stability and no fractional reserves (like Nubits probabaly has) not have utility??
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:13:36
...depends on where the interest comes from...

You have some interesting thoughts there! 
But mining doesn't equal nodes. Mining resources and the resources a node demands are not the same! And now the crucial thing: Miners compete with each other the exponential growth of hardware advancement does not matter. So the result is centralization due to mining hardware advancements. If mining hardware would not enhance anymore then the centralizing force would be cheap energy. Now some argue that hashing power could come from the heat your boiler requires. I doubt that because you boiler would have to handle a lot of bandwidth if tx would be as high as we both assume :)

"Helping the Bitcoin ecosystem" should be understood as standing up for the values Bitcoin stands for, otherwise it is just directed towards material interests of various groups. I prefer the first!

Looking at your posting history... You just hate on everything and did not present one argument here.

The wiki is outdated. Behavorial confirmation is not necessary anymore since a price feed (only applies shorts) and a 30 day maturity was implemented.

I am pretty sure that you did not read the whitepaper! Here it is  
Critique it in a rational way and contribute something to the discussion!
Overall it can be said that there is counterparty risk for the time where you exchange USD to BitUSD or CNY to BitCNY. As soon as you have your BitUSD/BitCNY there is no counterparty risk if you get it of the exchange that did the USD/BitUSD conversion. From here you can trade a price stable asset against other Assets that are pegged to other commodities or pay with your price stable asset.

Can someone enlighten me what the (moral) reasoning behind the censorship is? What argument can be made for deleting such free speech?
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:06:27
It's not trust based in the sense that you don't have to trust a centralized issuer that backs its value. See the video on bitshares.tv on how BitAssets work.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:28:12
Counterparty is not a side. It is a metaprotocol that is used to write and interpret arbitrary data attached to bitcoin tx. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:11:55
It's pretty simple and very comparable to Bitcoin: 
Bitcoin has value because it can be used for transferring value because people value it. But in order for people to value it it has to have utility in transferring value. Then speculators speculate on Bitcoin's adoption which gives it value and therefore allows for transferring money.

A "sudden crash" would be something like a 50% fall within a few hours... More sudden that it ever happened to Bitcoin...

How are the relations between mining pools more transparent? 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:28:37
There are two parameters: 
1) Volatility.
2) Counterparty risk / needing a third party to facilitate tx / needing a third party to maintain the value of the money (your bank could go broke).
Bitcoin has no counterparty risk but is volatile. BitUSD also has no counterparty risk but is non volatile.

What harm (except the privacy issue) could the actually do to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:49:13
You are only vulnerable for the time you use the gateway (done within minutes). On centralized exchanges you are waiting days and month to make your trade and are vulnerable during that time.

This is not that complicated:
Mining pools have about the same power as delegates (include include tx, black/whitelist tx etc). 
Miners have about the same power as Bitshares holders. Miners vote for Mining pools and BTS shareholders vote for delegates. 
Here are the two advantages of Dpos: 
- Miners have less incentive to act in favor of the value of BTC than BTS shareholders. 
- 6 Mining pools can more easily collude then 101 delegates. 
- For roughly the same security POW needs 2000 x more ressources (energy/money).
There is one advantage POW clearly has: Even if the internet would be shut down and you could not communicate with other Bitcoiners you could still determine what the longest chain (long range nothing at stake): Discussed here: 
Short term nothing at stake is not a problem: Delegates who sign more than one chain are voted out (can be automated).

The only thing BitUSD has in common with the dollar is the same purchasing power! It does not have counterparty risk like the dollars you hold with your bank. And BitUSD does not create demand for the USD of the FED! 
Here is a quote that describes what a dollar is: "This example demonstrates that a dollar is just an arbitrary label assigned to a certain amount of value. Just like you could have a dollar of silver or a dollar of gold, you could also have a dollar of corn, a dollar of oil, or a dollar of anything including a dollar of bitcoin!" ....So a BitUSD is always a Dollar worth of BTS.

There are many correct things you said. BitUSD has a lot of disadvantages (not accepted everywhere or rather nowhere atm (the software is still alpha) etc.) but it has a few things it is superior to the dollar too: Is is convenient to transfer (will be when the light client is out ;) ). 
BitUSD does not have counterparty risk in the sense that there would be someone that could loose the USD that would be held as collateral, you can read about the details and the risk assessment here:  
I am well aware of the POS discussion and it is tiring to me to go over it over and over again. You might also want to do some reading :) Here are a few links to common misconceptions about POS:   
I don't want to convince anyone. I just find it sad that such discussions often seem so biased. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:35:44
Bold claims without any arguments. Feel free to share why you come to this conclusion :) 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:03:11
That is true. The purchasing power of a dollar fluctuates of course and the exchange rate (to EUR, Gold etc.) fluctuates too. 
I just wanted to emphasize that BitUSD is not "the same" as a USD issued by the FED. The only thing the two have in common is the purchasing power. And if someone does not like that there is BitGold. Also a BitAsset based on a basket of goods is possible.  
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:32:06
I have read  (it describes long term nothing at stake, see above). Besides the link above, here is another post which explains why it is not a problem practically (=there are way bigger trust problems): 
I will read  But it looks pretty outdated. Maybe you could summarize the content?

There is a decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges, much like Bitcoin is a decentralized alternatives to centralized banking and government money! It is called Bitshares decentralized exchange. It works like this: There are so called BitAssets (for example BitUSD and BitBTC if you want to trade those two). BitUSD always tracks the value of the USD. 1 USD is always worth 1 USD. The value is not guaranteed by a centralized party but by the protocol / blockchain that makes sure that there is always sufficient collateral (200 to 300%) for each BitUSD (like wise for all other BitAssets) in existence. The collateral is held in BTS. 
More detailed info: 
If you want to trade USD against BTC you trade BitUSD against BitBTC like you trade the USD-IOU against the BTC-IOU on a centralized exchange with the exception that the BitUSD and BitBTC have no counerparty risk, i.e. there is no centralized entity that could loose your money since the blockchain holds the collateral and not a company or person that has received your USD/BTC. 
More detailed info: 
Now the question remains how you get from BTC and USD to BitBTC and BitUSD. Atm you have to buy BTS and buy BitUSD and BitBTC on the decentralized exchange (requires downloading the Bitshares wallet). But soon there will be so called gateways that will exchange USD/BTC for BitUSD/BitBTC 1:1... The wallet/decentralized exchange software can be tested already and works perfectly well:  (still a few problems on old computers; but light wallets are in the making). A fist gateway (BTC to BitBTC and back) already exists: 
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:12:38
Not yet... Gateways will come that do fiat too, i.e. exchange BitUSD for USD.
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:02:31
Nubits volume is due to market markers (inherent in their system). What counts in the end is what non geek users care about. Non volatility is clearly a value proposition.

We had that in another thread. But I am glad that you bring it up so everybody can be clear about the process and its risks: 
You are at counterparty risk for as long as it takes to get from fiat into a BitAsset and equally if you want out again. In contrast though to bter, bitstamp and mtgox you are not at risk that the exchange looses the funds you sent to it during the time you have your money in the exchange (trading and waiting to trade). 
And if you want to trade cryptocurrencies only (like on bter) then you are never at risk of the exchange loosing your funds.

That is what I mean, you are not able to hold a discussion that is based on arguments. Good luck to you!
