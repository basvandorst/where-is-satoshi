ehh you sound like my mother in Atlantic City. Right now you have X amount of dollars worth in fiat of BTC. If it drops you lose that money. Still losing money if it drops. If you cool with that thats cool but not best mentality to have

Biggest problem is conflating BTC with block chain. Block chain is the future, but there is nothing to say BTC is. Its like the .com Bubble. No shit the web was the future, but investing in anything with .com in the name with no basic fundamentals supporting the price and solely hype is how you get these crazy prices

How do you define adoption. Velocity has staid pretty much stagnant
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:33
But thats the problem until there is real adoption of BTC more the a HODLer asset. For everyone who buys on these dips the last money in gets burnt. Even a correction to 8k there needs to be something more to hold these prices even 8k is too much until something changes

Do you view BTC potential as a currency or an Instagram account? Adoption as a currency and adoption as a hyped up speculative asset are two different things. No one is using BTC they are buying with the intention of selling to someone else at a higher price

I bought at 3800 after China and sold at 10K. As much as I wish I waited a couple weeks, it was a great quick flip (It was like 1 month total). People need to realize no one has made money until they sell.

Im in other crypto groups both on facebook and reddit. Its worth discussing. By your logic every subreddit should be a bubble that supports whatever the topic is.....
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:17:58
Lol also at all business proposals in block chain being called white papers....

You described crypto/blockchain........ There is nothing special about BTC at this time other then first mover advantage, and does not justify the price until its starting to be used as such. Its like the guys at Pets.com pitching the web. Bitcoin isnt used much as a 


Its traded on exchanges and people looking for gainz.

Its clear at all the random  companies throwing block chain in the name of description have seeing their evaluations go up a shit ton. Bunch of biotech companies have thrown block chain in their descriptions/ future outlooks and saw huge gains in valuations

So did .coms, the point is that their fundementals in no way a correlate to the price increases. Your not seeing corresponding fundamentals with price increases. No one is using BTC way BTC is meant to be used. An the amount of people uses in as a medium of exchange (currencyish) are no increasing at much of a rate. (Pretty much look at Velocity of bitcoin over time)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:51
You are confusing new capital investment and actual adoption........ Buying and holding does little to velocity.........
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:33
I mean you can support and believe in BTC and still see the writing on the wall...... Its not abandoning BTC or scared money to sell right now and wait for after a correction. Make more money then just waiting it out
