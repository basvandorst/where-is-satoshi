bittrex is way better than cryptsy, bill rami and ryan are always on irc. cryptsy has cost me so much money over the last year that I refuse to use their junk. Let me know when you do launch your pool if you would, I can get a ton of hash for you guys.

this is a retarded arguement to a valid concern of many with all the shady shit that gaw keeps dishing out. So you don't care about buying hashpower that they can take off with at any point? If they had been more upfront about shit and gained some trust that they are going to be legit than maybe i wouldn't worry so much about it, but they keep doing fucked up shit and more and more as time goes on. 24 hour guarantee is gone, it was there 4 days ago. They dropped the ball this weekend and didn't send codes to a shitload of people, rather than say sorry and honor the 24 hour guarantee they took it down and are ignoring the tickets people filed well within their right to do so. This kind of thing should concern everybody. why? because if this is how they handle things they won't hesitate to bail when things get tough. and more importantly they are opening themselves to several lawsuits by not honoring their guarantee and then trying to act like it never existed. well when (not if) they do this and it catches up to them guess what they have to close up shop and their goes the hashlets. this is not the kind of company i'm going to trust not to fuck me over given the chance.

they are getting more and more shady everyday. the 24 hour guarantee is no longer on their page. this is convenient since myself and several people bought hashlets last weekend and didn't get activate codes until we called to complain monday morning. and yes now they are just ignoring my tickets. You guys want to buy these hashlets from a company that keeps getting sketchier by the day and trust that they dont disappear at some point with all your hashpower and btc? Regardless of how they started out they are losing the trust of their customers with all their shananigans.

i find it funny that gaw has fake pictures of their fake hashlets. photoshopped pictures of their "datacenter" and take down the 24 hr guarantee after they fucked up a bunch of peoples orders this past weekend and are now ignoring the tickets and acting like the 24 hr thing never existed. These guys that are defending them must not be very bright to see that a company that operates like this is not really a long term sure i trust you to not get sued and close up or just take off with my hashpower kind of business.
