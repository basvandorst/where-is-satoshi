If bitcoin rises to the heights that you hope, converting it back to fiat currency wold be considered stupid.

Trezor isn't available till Jan 2018, and ledger is a bit expensive for the amount that I currently have. Any cheaper alternatives?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:04:04
Hey thanks for this tip. I got my trezor a few days ago and it is a fantastic hardware wallet. Cheers

search your hd for a file called wallet.dat
Also try seeing if the "deleted email" was actually deleted. A lot of times they are either archived or marked for deletion but not deleted. Check your left side gmail tab and search through every tab for an email containing the words "private key", "wallet", "bitcoin", etc.

Is your hd damaged?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:24:37
Yes, but just this one time for you sweetie
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:53:26
This is fantastic. Well done

Do you think I will profit from this method in the long run, since I'll receive B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:03:15
Look up Satoshis, this idea is redundant.

Where is this from?

Mail it to me, I'll take care of it all for a small fee.

SR raid? Care to explain?
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:32:10
Doesn't seem deleted to me...
To answer your question, I just set up a full node for btc. The file size was like 145gb? Just download the client and it should tell you.

This subreddit is so cringe sometimes

2xers are admitting defeat and hopping back onto the real currency
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:07:37
And yet it's still at 120,000 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:34:25
Cool, would be interesting if they had longer term statistics on this. Although it would probably create tons of FUD
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:08:06
Wait till the difficulty adjustment
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:38:59
Oh my god that's amazing. Good for you both

Don't use coinbase. Use GDAX. They only do ACH from my understanding, so the funds must be in your GDAX account before making an order. Coinbase I believe makes the order under the assumption that the transfer will go through, and if it doesn't, they have to reverse it.
Also, GDAX fees are like 1/6 of coinbases.

By "uses", what do you mean? Long term investment, or an international form of cash?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:08:23
I'm aware of this, why was my transaction confirmed so fast then?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:59:01
I'm brand new to crypto, GDAX was my first choice and I'm very happy with it. Transfers take a while but they are 100% confirmed once they come through. Trading is fast and low fee, great UI and easy to use website.

How are you measuring sentiment? What reasoning do you use to make the conclusion that this may be worse than MtGox?

I see it this way: I’m hoarding a resource that I know will be the future of currency. I may not use it as a currency now, but I know it will be used as such in 10-15 years. I’m getting in now because the currency is much cheaper than it will be. I’m holding until bitcoin has figured out things like the lightning network, and I’ll be glad to use it as a currency once widespread adoption happens.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:48:11
Makes sense to me. But who knows?

I have a measly .14, and I am happy with that
