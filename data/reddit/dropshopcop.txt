There we go. Thank you for the help.
Still not sure on why crypto is better than my money currently resting inside a credit union, but it's not something that looks to leave the public eye soon. Might as well learn it before it becomes the norm.

You literally copy/pasted your last comment. 
Fuckit. I'll go search another forum.

You again? Lol broken troll is broken. Learn to lurk my friend. You are garbo.

I'm not amused in the slightest. Try again?

You're saying that the concept of blockchain prevents any cryptotheft from occuring? Or how their website puts it, not in favor of even the miner to commit theft?

Yup. You're exactly right. Can we get a new troll for this sub? This guy lost his touch ages ago and won't give it up.

Could you briefly reexplain all that for me?

I want to do stocks instead of crypto but it takes so much research and verification to get it right. You almost need an inside to make your mark. 
Not to say every day trader or term investor loses their ass but I want to obtain the knowledge it takes to never go less than what I put in. Don't we all though.

How so?

So you are that dumb. Gotcha.
