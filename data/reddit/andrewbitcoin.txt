Maybe in a few days or so, I'm thinking of 17th Friday or the week after. Keep checking the fee per byte :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:03:01
They have a choice. Let's be real, BCH holders want faster processing time with lower fees, why not just use ETH?
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:24:03
So the formula used for Mining is


Where 'max' is 2 to the powered of 224 (2^224) which means the probability of finding a hash is,


If you use this formula, which equals to, 1 divided by the difficulty times two to the powered of 32,


So the probability of finding a hash is calculated by


So to answer your question Nathan, if the average time to solve a block is greater than 10 mins, the difficulty goes down. However, if the average time to solve a block is less than 10 minutes, the difficulty goes up. BUT if the average time to solve a block is 10 minutes, the difficulty stays the same. In terms of why miners switched back to BTC, it is because most hashing power is pointed to BCH which means that the BTC PoW Speed went down, plus transaction fees piling up in unmined blocks, which made BTC more profitable to mine.

qouting this for future reference.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:29:29
Agreed, overpaid your fees.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:29:57
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:25:04
I heard that some miners will force the B2X update. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:38:57
It depends how low the fees will drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:07:49
You mean just today?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:20:27
BCH is basically free money, enjoy while it lasts.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:07:14
This is exactly the same story with me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:26:07
Everyone should start placing posters up for BTC and clean off the shitcash ones
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:15:00
If you only bought BTC and held them till today you currently have BCH, BTG. BTG wallet isn't out yet but BCH is what you currently have. Theres tutorials out there but in short terms, you need to have a BCH wallet (be careful on what you download) then send the BCH to an exchange that supports BCH then sell for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:06
Low dip = High Jump
$10k BTC confirmed??
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:34:13
But you have to realize, BTC took time to develop while BCH is basically just a clone of BTC that's heavily modified.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:05:16
I remember when I tried to explain bitcoin back in 2012-2013, no one gave a shit until now. SMH
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:48:07
If you are here to make money, I would recommend in looking out for other cryptocurrencies of course. But personally, I have 85% in BTC, 10% in altcoins and 5% BTC reserve for weekly trading.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:08:11
Yes you can dump your BCH, you need to obtain a BCH wallet then import your private key (make sure you use a trusted wallet), afterwards use a exchange BCH/BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:42:20
Woahh, did you make it yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:35:22
Been holding BTC since 2009-2010, I've seen many attempts of other coins trying to bring BTC down. Honestly, I do believe BTC will be replaced but not in a very very long time as long as we work on a constant solution to the problems.
Bcash is an example of trying to mask a shit smell with a freshener spray. The problem is still there but you're doing something that covers the main problem up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:50:22
Agreed! And if exchanges start releasing BCH to BTC holders, very sure most of them would sell their BCH.

Its going to take quiet a while, can't you change the fees?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:19:06
You have a point, but I'm sure in that span of 20 years we can find a way to solve BTC's problems without creating another problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:29:43
It might dip to $6000-$6200 at its lowest but keep an eye out.

As a trader you shouldn't be affected with FOMO, learn to read charts and indicators, back it up with facts and history.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:26:30
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:19:35
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:58:13
Welcome to the world of cryptocurrencies.
I'll simplify it for you.
Bitcoin is like KFC, anyone can just copy the idea, add some spices, some different variations to it. But if you have the original recipe, sure, people can make something as close to or as good as the original recipe, but it will never be the same as the original. Back in terms of cryptos, if slow transaction times is a big problem to you (most newbies hate this problem) then just switch to a different alt like ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:00:47
Learn how to read charts and indicators, pair it up with a bit of media and news and you've got yourself a good base.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:58:12
That could work, mine is 85% in BTC and 15% in alts anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:17:05
You have to perform a child pays for parent action in Electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:28:40
Some un-cirumstances could be a pump and dump in other coins where they would sell their BTC for that certain coin to earn profit. Lots more reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:06:35
I'm not calling anyone stupid, it is a problem, but for the mere fact that people say making another altcoin is the solution, it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:08:03
Make sure it makes BTC dip so I can buy in more BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:30:47
Okay so, you state you're a panicked BTC holder, that just gives me a hint your new into this cryptocurrency "game". Second thing, you shouldn't panic in situations like these, back then the same old story happened with LTC, ETH replacing BTC. In terms of ETH, ETH isn't an uncertainty, I would understand if we were talking in terms of a different altcoin about the uncertainty but we once had a flippening with ETH (check coinmarketcap BTC dominance with ETH) people thought that ETH would overcome BTC, but surely it didn't.


You have to also take in consideration if BCH is really the future, why didn't they do it earlier? Why didn't they do it when the problem first occurred? Why did it take them this long to release BCH? Also, if you think BCH is the fix, remember that to fix something, you have to fix it properly, not mask it with something, it's like saying I have a big scratch on my car, but I'll just fix it with a sticker to hide it. To really fix a problem like BTC, is to come together and find a solution, BCH however is only a temporary solution to the problem, how you may ask? If BCH was really the future, this and that, why are people resistant to change? Because most of us know that making another altcoin like BCH isn't a full solution, because its already been done many times but never wins. Remember, to fix a problem is to fix it from its source, not to create another problem.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:29:25
I do get out, a good trader must know whats going on around. We are basically dealing with money.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:05:33
The downvoters are real.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:07:26
Of course using BTC for microtransactions at this point in time is not practical, but meanwhile, if we cannot perform it, why can't other people switch to another alt while we get this fixed?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:17:14
That's good enough
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:39:53
And whys that?
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:01:16
Of course, but in this context we are talking about the BCH and BTC thing.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:08:16
It will have to correct or hover a bit before launching off. I'd say End of this month.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:48:31
Your right, money is money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:06:22
More like "resistance against shitcoins"
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:45:14
I don't see a drop, however if there was going to be a drop due to FOMO and uncircumstances it would have a $6000-$6200 support range. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:07:48
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:32:23
Never, never, never leave your assets (BTC) long term online especially on a website, who knows what might happen to them.
I've seen people actually engrave their private keys in a small metalic slab/sheet if you want to go that route. (But of course, no one will know what those numbers will mean)
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:16:35
Welcome to the world of cryptos my friend. Many people trying to do crazy things for money. *cough* BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:39:02
Calming things? More like actual real facts compared to that shitcash. Most people just want faster transaction times and lower fees, then move to ETH or something, not that hard.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:36:01
But in this case, I needed dump BCH for some more BTC before the prices of BCH plummets down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:49:45
Since 11' ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:46:17
Honestly, I can't be assed arguing at this point. All I see in BCH supporters are impatient people that want faster transaction times with lower fees and chucked their BTC into BCH and are now in price loss.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:03:38

Everyones gotta love fried chicken.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:17:25
In the end of the day, we should be happy our assets are in BTC, not BCH 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:43
Theres plenty more surprises to come, if you hold BTC, just hold it during those times.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:04:38
And never buy Bcash! 
Bcash supporters






@_date: 2017-11-13 13:01:34
Its most likely going to go up to $8k.
Just hold it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:03:35
Eh, that's still good enough.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:14:49

Forgot to add also learn to look for social media information too and all those stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:26:01
Yes, of course. You can mine other altcoins if you want to make money,

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:25:27
Well, close to peak. You can tell in the charts when it rises more than a certain percentage then dips.

I think your in the wrong subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:26:22
I'm guessing you're a BCH supporter? If slow transactions with high fees is such an issue for you, why not just change to ETH? I would like to know your response.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:22:58
It was worse yesterday at $25 median fee, some even at $50-$100 (higher bytes of course). $11 is getting better.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:01:21
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:38:26
Because they hold private keys and you don't, so when they suddenly disappear or become hacked, that's the last of your asset. If you say that they're insured, the process of trying to reclaim your stolen/lost funds is a hassle.
I have my private keys on different usbs in a zip file with a master password.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:08:59
Especially when you hold more than 25 BTC, hehehe.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:16:30
Still good enough ;)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:24:28
Let me guess, you dumped most of your BTC savings to BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:08:52
Microtransactions? Yes, its hard to do day-to-day transactions, so why not use ETH for that? We are in a process of trying to speed up the transactions and lower the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:52:21
STRAT, SC, MCO. I will start to invest weekly once I'm not that busy. But BTC is my main asset.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:34:01
* 1) Soon, give it some time.
* 2) A long time (depends on how much your sending)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:29:25
I regret not selling it at peak, lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:30:29
Its now at 709sat per byte for the fees  It was 950sat/byte yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:27:42
No one is qualified as an expert, however, I've been in this for a long time now, but that necessarily does not prove that I'm an expert but I do have some knowledge in this field.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:45:15
We just needed to educate new traders to never fully dump your BTC to something like BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:04:45
That's not only the reason.
We sell our BCH for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:52:36
Bittrex and dump that BCH for BTC. Simple.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:39:32
Practice makes perfect.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:06:27
Bcash supporters claim that they could have won if the transaction times were faster so they would sell their BTC.
PLOT TWIST, What if the transaction confirmations were intentionally slowed down to avoid people selling their BTC to BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:04:12
But it dipped during the crisis, wouldn't that mean you should have bought during the dip?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:21:45
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:44:44
You got to factorize in something before you say its better. Sure faster this, lower that. While you shit yourself and complain why not just switch your BTC to ETH while we work on BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:40:10
I know its best to trust your gut feeling but you got to factorize in the current facts. Based on  BTC has most of its miners mining for it. Most of the unconfirmed transactions in BTC is also being processed already (more than 50k) the fees are also dropping too. You can check out other statistics there.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:45:35
And have a banggin year!
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:17:33
Good thing you didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:32:46
Why is it ridiculous? 
I am a firm believer that there is a solution to BTC's problems. If everyone believed BCH was the future, this and that, why don't we all agree on it? Because it is centralized. Sure, the BCH blockchain is decentralized but did we really ALL agree to have BCH? No, we didn't. If people wanted change, most of us will have to all agree on it, not just a portion of the people. BCH is basically those running away from the main problem, because from what I've observed, is those who were panicking because they were afraid of loosing their BTC, they weren't agreeing with the idea of BCH. They just switched because they were **afraid** to loose what they have.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:32:05
What? Can you rephrase what you just said?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:07:53
Good decision my friend.
