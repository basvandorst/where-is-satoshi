I moved from my house when I was at college back home and it got lost in the move. Probably one of my parents threw it away lmao

I emptied the first address in 2014 to put a down payment on a house. The rest are just extra addresses I have in cold storage. My heart skipped a beat because I lost a paper wallet back in 2012 that would be worth millions today. This was not that wallet. I’m still poor.

I thought about making this into one of those “laying awake in bed at night” memes. But honestly it doesn’t bother me that much. I still got a down payment for a house off of basically $0 investment. Ironically, if I would have waited to buy my house until last year I could have just bought it outright instead if having 25 years left on a mortgage.  Such is life.

Its got some good advice and some ridiculous advice. Kind of fun to read I guess. I caught some fish using one of the artificial dam methods one time, then fucked it all up when I tried to cook it using one of the oven making methods. 
Its a nice coffee table book or conversation piece, the covers are a tough feeling textured rubber.

That's still "buy a Tesla" money! Shit.

I checked the rest of them after I found this. No luck.

The worst thing that could happen is people send money to those addresses. I burned the first one in 2014 but the rest are still mine and secure, and empty.
