Yes, you can, and I personally think that's the smart thing to do. One of these days, customs agents will start scanning laptops for Bitcoins, and it's going to hit some people out of the blue. They'll do it whether it's legal or not. The reality is, border agents do pretty much whatever they like, and you can't do anything about it.
But if you have no trace of Bitcoin whatsoever on your laptop, then... "these aren't the data we're looking for. You can go about your business. Move along."

Because "not a scam" and "100% safe and secure" are not the same thing? Because Bitcoins aren't FDIC insured?
Coinbase is used by thousands of Americans. It's not a scam. But you should hold your BTC yourself, where *you* control the private keys.
But at this point, you don't need to buy buying $6k worth. You should be buy $60 worth, max, and get to know how it works over the next few months.

Shortest answer: Because people *want* to make other coins.
Longer: Maybe people don't like all the features of Bitcoin, or the algorithm used. Or maybe they just want a coin named after themselves.
But the cryptocurrency cat's out of the bag now. There's no one to tell someone "No, you can't do that, we already have Bitcoin." There *is* no authority.
Whatever their reasons, ultimately people just do it because they *want* to, and they *can*.
To answer your question, "What are the purposes of altcoins?" Whatever people want them to be. It's really only up to the people using the coin to decide that.
I don't understand what you mean by "we" having Bitcoin as "our" main cryptocurrency. It is the world's most popular as far as I know, if that's what you mean.

Coinbase limits the amount you can purchase (instantly). This can help a lot of people who want to be paid in Bitcoin and can't *easily* make large(-ish) transactions.

How to calculate minimum tx fee?
Apparently the minimum tx fee for Bitcoin is determined by a number of things, one of which is tx length. If it's 1000 bytes or under, then 10000 satoshis, 1001 - 2000, then 20000, and so on.
But when you generate a raw tx, you have to include the inputs &amp; outputs *first*, then sign the inputs, and then you will know the size of the raw tx.
So it is necessary to first make a raw tx without any fees, sign it, then look at the size to determine the proper fee *and then* make a *new* transaction with fees included? Or is there another way?
Also, is there an algorithm or pseudocode for determining the minimum required tx fee for any given transaction, taking into account unspent input amounts, priority and tx size?
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:26:19

If only it were that easy...
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:11:49
If you're going to do that, then just encrypt the seed, back it up, and export the master public key. Then you can continue to send funds to new addresses all the time and only access them with the seed. Just don't lose the seed (better if you memorize it).
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:57:21

The current credit system is really fucked up. *Any one* of millions of businesses in the US can claim that I owe a debt with just my SS even if it's not true.
That happened to me with a business I'd never heard of. I had to call a business who had reported me just to find out what they even did and why was there a hit on my credit report. The business is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I was traveling outside of the US the entire month that the hit occurred.
I contacted the company to get them to take it off &amp; they didn't have the time to look it up. I then contacted the credit bureaus to have it disputed and they rejected my request, saying it was valid.
My next step would have been to get a lawyer and take some kind of legal action - which at the time I couldn't justify paying for.

I just wish more charities would be open to accepting Bitcoin. I've emailed 2 now, and only got one reply, which was:
"We have bitcoin but I am not comfortable using it right now... I hope you understand..."

The "fee" they charge you is not 100% for the Bitcoin protocol transaction fee — it's the fee they charge for withdrawals.
They usually split that (at least in the past) into a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC (given to the miners) and a 0.0005 BTC fee for BTC-e themselves.

I see nothing about Bitcoin on your website.
I suggest:
1) putting the "Bitcoin accepted here" logo at the bottom next to the Visa, etc. logos.
2) Making it available when I add an item to the cart &amp; proceed to check out. All I saw was a Paypal button and the name/address, etc. input fields. I didn't see anything regarding Bitcoin or how I could pay on that page.

How do I "Bitcoin sign" a message using either bitcoinjs-lib or bitcore (Javascript Bitcoin libraries)?
I've been pounding my head on my desk, trying to figure out how to produce something like this Ruby output, but in javascript:
    $ irb -rbitcoin
    &gt;&gt; message = 'Coinkite'
    =&gt; "Coinkite"
    &gt;&gt; k = Bitcoin::Key.generate
    =&gt;    
    &gt;&gt; Bitcoin.sign_message(k.priv, k.pub, message)
    =&gt; {"address"=&gt;"1LJZLjseZxKHvr1bhQqripns36CZvDAkMT", "message"=&gt;"Coinkite", "signature"=&gt;"IHJpg/A0DIz39sa8Se2mWyzE4BxFLFarexdqCpR4aMRULyDlHvcp9oV+jIi9hsZ6Ea2aTiHERIS4DHFPnuxEr/U="}
All I would like to do is get the 'signature' part, but I don't think I'm encoding the signed message right.
What I have so far using Bitcore (but something is missing):
    var bitcore = require('bitcore')
    var Address = bitcore.Address;
    var key = bitcore.Key.generateSync()
    var addr = Address.fromKey(key).toString();
    var message = "Coinkite"
    console.log("address = ", addr)
    console.log("message = " + message)
    // == "compressed" message format signatures
    var signed = bitcore.Message.signMessage(message, key)
    console.log("signed = ", signed)
    console.log("signed.length = ", signed.length)
    console.log("signed = ", signed.toString('base64'))
    console.log("signed = ", signed.toString('hex'))
    // == DER message format signatures
    //var signed = bitcore.Message.sign(message, key)
    //console.log("signed = ", signed.toString('base64'))

I believe that this is how all network infrastructure will operate someday. Small fees included with each request will be the incentive for hardware to accept/forward connections.
The internet infrastructure (routers, etc) will be decentralized like a mesh network (in fact that's what it will be exactly if I understand "mesh networks" correctly).
Large companies won't have a monopoly on infrastructure, because anyone can run a node. The nodes with the lowest fees will get the most traffic and create healthy marketplace competition.

Hi Eric,
Regarding what I'd like to see, would be less merge commits/bubbles (theoretically none), because they're just noise. Also more meaningful commit messages to master, e.g. "fixed" is probably not too helpful.
May I ask the reason that you avoid FF merges? Feature history is all I can think of, and that can be accomplished using tags if really necessary. (It looks like it's currently done using commit-message prefix namespacing, if that's even a thing. I'm thinking all the "paypro" changes.)
The Copay and Bitcore repos are what I've looked at the most and what I'm currently referring to, but Insight has a lot of ugly merge bubbles too.
I will PM you with details of specific examples.

This would have happened eventually regardless of the catalyst. Gox was just the first big free-market failure. Government will *always* want a slice of the profits.

The global internet infrastructure is currently extremely fragile. One single ISP or government could take out a large portion of the internet via a "kill-switch".

Everyone has to have a "fixed residence". If you bank, of course you have to have a "job". It's all bullshit, but it's pretty much required to use a lot of the modern conveniences (banking, credit history, etc).
You could incorporate and give yourself a "job" that way. You're now a Senior Software Developer at You, Inc. Problem solved.

How so? It's a solid technology. Your paragraph above is opinion and completely subjective:


How did it "pretend" anything? And how do you know that Dash's creator did anything out of fear?
Do you have any concrete empirical evidence of Dash being a scam? That's an awfully emotionally-charged statement. Can you support it with facts **backed up by evidence**, as opposed to just re-writing the above?
I can logically assume you'll look at my reddit history and start calling me out as a Dash "shill" or some other such nonsense, so I'll, go ahead and co-opt you by stating that yes, I'm a fan of Dash. But it's got a solid technology and team behind it, and that's *why* I'm a fan.
