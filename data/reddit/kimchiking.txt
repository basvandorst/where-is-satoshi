Thanks man.

Oh okay, so it's a different Graphene from the Trademarked Graphene that Bitshares uses. That's odd.

Is this the same Graphene technology that the Bitshares Decentralized Exchange is built upon?

Could you explain how this Graphene is different? I honestly want to know.

While this new form of Graphene technology seems promising we can't say for sure when or it it will ever be used by Bitcoin. For now, the BitShares DEX already uses Graphene technology.
This blockchain has an average block time of 1.5 seconds, 3 seconds max, and has been tested to handle 3300 TPS with a theoretical capacity of 100K-180K+ TPS. Therefore, it can already handle the trading volume of BTC, ETH, and Visa combined.
BitShares has been operational for three years now and powers it's own decentralized exchange.
People do not understand everything that BitShares offers so they immediately discard it as a scam. If you do your research you will quickly discover that BitShares is the furthest thing from a scam.

If you try to draw your symbol by hand it will look sloppy each time. With the design I propose it's easy to draw and isn't confused with the symbol for USD.

Or just start using the Bitshares network. Makes Bitcoin seem like a snail.

The situation in Venezuela is absolutely terrible, but I'm glad some of the locals have found a solution that helps to protect their wealth and demonstrates a real world use case for crypto.
I'm just sharing an idea so take it for what it's worth. I would like to introduce a possible alternative to using BTC there in Venezuela. I'm sure you've heard of EOS and its creator Dan Larimer. The alternative I'm talking about was actually Dan's first crypto project called BitShares. It's been fully operational since 2013 and currently handles the most blockchain transactions per day than any other crypto on the market today. You can see for yourself at blocktivity.info.
My idea is for the locals to use either the BitShares token BTS or even a price stable token like bitUSD for daily commerce and wealth protection. Localbitcoin provides a valuable service, but since it doesn't support BitShares based assets we needed a better alternative. Thankfully, there's a new site called mrkt.cash which does exactly what Localbitcoin does and supports BitShares based assets. Mrkt.cash is still very new and requires active users, but the infrastructure is there for use.
The ability for local merchants to accept crypto is also very important so I suggest they use the new PalmPay system. It's free for merchants and allows them to accept up to 8 different cryptocoins. They can then use the mrkt.cash site to convert their crypto into fiat or use any one of the fiat gateways built directly in the PalmPay app itself. For more details about PalmPay please visit palmpay.io.
I hope that you take this information to heart and share it with every person you can there in Venezuela. They need as many solutions as possible to make their lives better. Relying on the government is no longer an option.
