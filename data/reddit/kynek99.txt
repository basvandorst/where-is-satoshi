I'm pretty sure someone will finally build a fully decentralized exchange where bitcoins are locked by smart contracts, and private keys are on the customer side. No hack like that will be possible.  
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:27:56
~ $2500.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:00:03
It will be  $5700 at the pick dropping to ~ $2500 after September of 2017.

Bitcoin is data protected by the blockchain, so why would we need to pay VAT to own data. If so, should I pay VAT for every bit of data I publish online or on my own PC ?

Unfortunately it wont drop to 300s, we would be already there after the hack if that would be the case.

I would say opposite. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:17:11
I was hoping it could drop more before another run. It doesn't look like we will stay in $600s for long time, so I'm trying to collect more B and the amount of $$$ to do it is limited :).

Stolen coins never end up on an exchange. They won't move for months or years. The same way Mt Gox and the previous Bitfinex hacks cons didn't move to any exchange. Most likely they will be used on the black market. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:52:12
I still don't understand why the price tanked. Those coins just changed the owner (they didn't disappear), and I'm pretty sure wouldn't be touched for years. 
What's different between now and 2 days ago ?

Agree 100%, but that's how it's right now. It doesn't mean that it's always going to be like that. It's possible for bitcoin to be even more fungible since everyone can own some on their phone and exchange for pretty much everything.  
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:30:31

- There will be only 21 million bitcoins ever created - you don't exactly know how much gold is still under the ground.
- You can store million of dollars worth of bitcoin on your cellphone or paper - gold would weigh tons.
- You don't impact anything else by increasing price of bitcoin - If gold price would be $100.000 all electronic could be way more expensive.
- You can by more and more things using bitcoin - There is no place I'm aware of I can go and buy thing in exchange for gold.
- I can easily send any amount of money using bitcoin to my family or friends all around the world. - It's super expensive or maybe not even possible to send someone bars of gold.
- I can divide Bitcoin into 100.000.000 pieces - Gold is not divisible after some point. 
I could keep going with this, by my point is that Bitcoin is way better than Gold and Silver combined.

I agree that we need to keep building out infrastructure for payments, but building thousands of mile of roads is way more time consuming task than create services from bitcoin.

It's called an investment to open a channel. 
Payment channels between mining pools and miners will be the only way to get paid in the future. When reward is going to be less then 1 Bitcoin per block, nobody is going to pay transactions fees every time mined bitcoins are sent to the miner. No matter how big block are, this is not going to work.

If I don't ignore it, what should I do ?

That's right. Bitcoin will be a units of measurement in the digital assets world. We don't need bitcoin to be a reserve currency at all.

It looks like there is only $1.618 billion in Tether
Also I really don't care how people are getting their Bitcoin. The main goal is to have as many Bitcoins as possible. You can work for it, you can buy it with dollar, Euro or any other fiat, you can also create fake money somebody is willing to accept in exchange for Bitcoin. It doesn't matter. The fake money will die, and my real Bitcoin is going to stay under my private keys.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:17:07

In 10-20 years that $15,000 is going to buy you much. Interest rates are not going higher, passably going deeply into negative area, so value of your savings are going to go down drastically.  Good luck

I don't mind people selling em, because it allows me to buy more. I'm collecting them the same way as I'm collecting $$$ on my 401K... so I'm not going to sell no matter what the price is going to be. I will buy something "big" one day and pay with bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-04-08 18:20:54
I'm pretty sure miners won't stop mining because of halving. They don't sell mined coins right away. Their vision is to collect coins and sell when the price is right from them. Also the biggest farms have long term contracts with their power supplier, so if they don't mine they lose more than have 50% reward.

Why would you care. Don't you just need transactions to be validated and new blocks created? Let them mind until they hit the silicon chip technology limitation wall.  Also, because of the cheapest electricity, they are going to win anyways.
Bitcoin is an open system, so we should not be blocking anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:15:46
There is so much support on many levels between $10,000 and $1,000 that I don't think we will ever see $1000. I even think that we might not see price under $10,000 ever again after the last dip two days ago. There is more, and more people buying bitcoin and holding for long term every day that I think will support the price higher and higher every single month. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:01:43
What you mean by "cryptocurrencies are crashing naturally" ?
The price of Bitcoin went down because more people sold then bought in last few weeks. Now, somebody like Tether is doing their tricks to get more Bitcoin at this price. 
If you find a better idea how to get Bitcoin in exchange for something else someone is willing to accept go for it please let me know.
The most popular way at this moment is to give away your fiat for Bitcoin, but people like to discover new things that gives them what they need, and Tether it is one of those things. 
The only risk I see is when you sell your Bitcoin in exchange for Tether in times of Bitcoin price decline to protect your profits. Now if Tether collapse that day than you wont be able to buy anything for that Tether. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:41:19
Bitcoin on average goes up by 450%. Last year was about %1000, but in 2015 was a lot less, so I'm expecting about 286% gain this year.

@_date: 2018-01-19 18:39:04

This is actually a good news. I bought more.

Each node knows only nodes that have open channels with. It almost works like network routers that know only about their own gateways , and the gateways will connect to other gateways. Once the network grows the number of possible routes increases and speed increases as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:04:26
1 BTC is 1 BTC, the price discovery is driven by people buying and selling Bitcoin. Nobody wanted to pay $20,000 for one Bitcoin, but it looks like a lot of people will pay $11,000 for one Bitcoin. Bitcoin has it's own value, but for now we just translate in dollars how much people are willing to pay to get Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:19:16
The limitation is network bandwidth between source and destination node. Since there will be many paths between nodes I'm sure the network it large enough it will be able to handle millions transactions per second.

Do you know what logarithmic scale means?  When you buy something that is very limited supply, the price goes expectantly not linearly. You always look at the % gain, not at the price with Bitcoin.
It was way harder to go from $0 to $100 than from $1000 to $10000

I would rather say "Nobody wants to spent bitcoins" We are at the stage where most of those involved believe the price will go way higher. This is the opposite of the current financial system where money is losing it value from day to day, so everyone wants to spent money and gain more physical goods now.
Would people spent that much if let's say interests rates are 40% and everyone is making money by keeping them in banks.

If you add additional ~ 200 PH/s hashing power, the price will go up. If the price go up, even more hashing power will be added my miners which will cause another price increase. I think if someone would try to add a lot of hashing to try to control 51%, it would be a good thing for bitcoin actually. I hope someone is going to do it.

They don't get it that there is no blockchain without bitcoin. No one is going to run 50MW hardware to protect the blockchain without reward, and if it is not protected by thousands of computers, it's just a database you can maintain for a few dollars a month, and that's not the blockchain.

Sure we can have more zeros, and divide 1 bitcoin even more. The author doesn't understand that the actually number of bitcoin units is 2.100.000.000.000.000, and we can keep adding zeros as many as we need. The price of 1 unit will be the same.

By the time we have quantum computers, the protocol will be improved multiple times, and with full Earth of quantum computers you wouldn't be able to do it. At some point bitcoin is only going to be a protocol for payment processors the same way TCP/IP is for communication between OSI layers , and the private/public keys are only going to be used during the transaction period. You would only have milliseconds to find the private key. It would be like sessions ID in SSL-WebSeal communication, and good luck with cracking that :D

@_date: 2015-06-24 17:24:05
In order to do that, most people would need to sell their coins, and I don't think that will happen. I pretty sure that there are some Bots waiting for the price to drop to some level to execute major buys. It means something that the price drop stops at $230 level. 
I think even with multiple countries banning bitcoin the protocol is valuable to some group of people :) and they will buy them if the price is right, and I'm pretty sure it's not going to be $1.

Yes, because bitcoin is something many people, organization, and institutions were waiting for long time. Bitcoin isn't perfect (nothing can be perfect), but it solves so many issues of the current financial system, and it's open to everyone. Now everyone can built a business on top of that protocol, and doesn't have to go through corrupted organizations that might not allow her/him to accept payments because of whatever reason. Open source is a future of many things, not only "money".

No one is asking them to come up with regulations!!. It's our (people) network, not Banks network. I think, whoever has a full node running or whoever is mining Bitcoins should be working on regulations, not banks only. Why we have to agree with theirs regulations? They should agree with our regulations!!! Banks didn't build this ecosystem, we did, so it should be in our hands how the system is going to be regulated.

@_date: 2014-12-03 21:23:34
That is also true, but keep in mind that it doesn't have to take that much power to process even all possible financial translations on the planet. Power usage is only related to the ongoing competition about who gets more Bitcoins before the reward drops. As we keep going with new generation of miners the power usage will drop as well.
With this protocal we can use heat generated by miners to power another equipment. I don't see a reason why we couldn't build electric furnace that mines bitcoin and heats your house during winter and pool during summer. 
Banks data centers are used to store and analogize data, bitcoin ecosystem can be use for multitude options, imagination is your only limit.

Bitcoin needs to be regulated somehow in order to start using bitcoin services without the risk of loosing your coins.  Right now if someone is taking your bitcoin for anything , you're not protected, and you might not get whatever you were looking for. For instance, I can create a website, sell things for bitcoin and never send anything to anyone, but of course collect all bitcoin. Wild, wild west is good, but too risky to fully explode in usage.

@_date: 2015-05-29 22:40:38
The reason why bitcoin is so great is because it has limited and predicted supply. If something else, physical on this planet could have limited supply, it could be even better as a store of value.  Give me one thing beside bitcoin and other cyrpto that have known, limited, predicted and measured supply, easy to track the flow internationally...

Bitcoin = savings, 
All others = debt - 
debt = inflation = lost of value.
If money wouldn't lose any value in last 100 year, you wouldn't have to work so hard to buy a house or a car, because you would use your grandfather money to pay for things. But because he was making 10c an hours, you can buy a bubble gum with his savings. 
Think twice before you say Visa or all other debt related source of payment are better then bitcoin. Right now it's more risky and difficult to use bitcoin, but wait and ask your grand kids what they would prefer.

Why they don't sell at $966 ?
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:24:10
Another option is to buy more BTC and just keep them on the exchange. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:29:48
Thanks. If you need some advise, let me know.

@_date: 2015-01-04 01:42:12
Very true, the drop will stop when BTC close the lifecycle of payments. We pay merchants, they pay wages, products, electricity and other expanses using BTC  than the price will continuously grow. I don't think this is going to happen in less than 5 year... but I can wait. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:50:28

With this price big farms will go out of business quickly :) Home mining is going to come back! 
@_date: 2016-03-30 14:25:41
Mining centralization is going to end soon. 16um ASIC chips will allow to integrate mining into all electronics and let everyone mine coins on decentralized pools. 1 billion 100Ghps devices will take over hashing power. 
So, I don't think we have a problem here at this stage of the network. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:27:52
Bitcoin sucks, blockchain rocks... I'm sick of those people already.  Why they are so excited about something that bitcoin introduced, but hate the actual bitcoin which is the fuel of the blockchain technology.  Please stop.

Keep in mind there is 25BTC being generated every ~10 min, It is impossible to buy them all till around 2140 :) You can try, but the price will be crazy and the hash rate will sky rocket as well... so please try and let see what is going to happen

@_date: 2016-03-29 18:16:05
There is no prof that we have any unneeded transactions. I think a lot of people just transact between bitcoin addresses which only shows the growth of the bitcoin network.
If this is going to be a problem for longer period of time, we will find a solution. Also there is already several ongoing developments to increase bitcoin transactions bandwidth 
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:06:56
All set, I sent 7 BTC to make sure everything is fine. Please process your transaction.

Some people cannot reconcile with the fact that open source is taking over a lot of things.
Whatever they would create that should be "better" than bitcoin wont be open source and someone will control it. That will get us to the place where we are right now in next X amount of years again. 
The POWER of bitcoin is that the free market controls it, not corporations. Free market should be the organism that controls things like value, because it cannot be manipulated. Bitcoin price relies on buy &lt;-&gt; sell mechanism that is the healthiest factor of good economy.

640K ought to be enough for anybody.” -Bill Gates (1981)
INTERVIEWER: I read in a newspaper that in 1981 you said, “640K of memory should be enough for anybody.” What did you mean when you said this?
BILL GATES: I’ve said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time.
We at Microsoft disagreed. We knew that even 16-bit computers, which had 640K of available address space, would be adequate for only four or five years.
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:53:48
What does it mean ?
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:18:58

Great recap.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:53:32
With appropriate fees you can have transactions go in 2-3 blocks. 
Just wait for layer two applications to have unlimited amount of possible transactions :P. When that time comes you will have to pay $10,000+ for one coin.

By having so many bitcoins he can manipulate the price so other people can buy cheaper. I'm sure if he would want he could drop the price to $5 and than bring it back to $500.

@_date: 2015-01-01 23:32:24
Yes, that's why I used "&gt;" so 30 GB as of now, and that will last for next ~ 3 months. 
I'm asking how much CPU and RAM full node needs to operate efficiently.
I'm planning to stand up several nodes on old servers I manage, and I want to reserve (ESXi, VitrualBox) as minimum resources as possible beside HDD. I will have 250GB dedicated for each of them.
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:12:36
If this makes you 1 BTC a day, what is going to happen of 30 million people buy this product ?
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:45:23
I agree with you, but I think China might have the cheapest hardware, so the investment is low.

Here is the link to their website that is showing all online payments, and I don't see Bitcoin

@_date: 2015-01-15 04:10:50

This time will do under 0. First time ever we will have negative price. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:54:24
I have exactly the same strategy. I will either go to crap with my BTCs or gain once the price is higher than I bought. I actually never plan to sell them, I will spend them when they are worth to spend. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:27:14
Whoever owns most of bitcoins can open that bank of his/her cellphone, and keep buying them to stabilize the price at let say $100K

Also we don't even know how many Linux servers are out there. It's hard to imagine Windows servers right now running new startups. Also big corporations are moving from AIX to Linux based systems.

Well, $192 per coin will still over power cost. I guess China will be the only country that is going to produce BTC and the rest of the World will buy from them as everything else :) I don't see a reason why not
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:02:09
we need proof of proof before we can start coming up with more proofs :) BTC hasn't been really tested yet, and we're already making comments that it isn't working. Even though the idea started in 2009, 2013 was the year when public started using it, so it's 2 year only. In 3-5 years we can tell whether it's working or not. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:38:16

Bitcoin is controlled by free market, U.S Dollars by FED. A free market is a P2P relationship. Who is FED, a group of Banks. What Banks want, grain profit at the expense of free market. What FED with U.S Dollar showed us. It can put most powerful country in $17T debt in a decade. So I think that's your answer.

Nope, that was just me moving some coins around in last 3 days.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:43:17
I don't think it will go below $50. There is too much $$$ put into that market right now, and there will be a lot of buys before that bottom.
Whoever invested millions to buy mining equipment will shut down minders and instead of paying for electricity cost, they will start buying them. I suspect hash rate will drop severely next month when price breaks through $100

@_date: 2015-01-27 16:57:57
Not going to happen. It's going to take them several years to do it, and bitcoin will be already replacing a lot of things, and people are going to love bitcoin because it means freedom. Banks should focus on collecting bitcoins since the price is very low, and work on services they could provide using that protocol instead of wasting their time reinventing the wheel. I know they wan to control money flow because that gives them power, but that isn't what people should want.

One interesting thing is this:
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:47:57
I agree with you but I just can't stand those post " I lost $xxx because of price drop". To me it's like you asked for that by selling under the price you previously paid it for.

The questions is why do you think I would, or anyone else sell at $10,000. I bought most of my coins at ~$250, and now the price is 3 times higher, so it should be a good time to sell, but I'm not selling. I'm not going to sell at $10,000 neither. 
Some people invest in Bitcoin very long term, and the price doesn't matter to them that much. At some point of life I want to give some of my coins to my kids so they can buy a house and a car without taking loans, that's the point of my investment.

I think MtGox was the old Netscape, and MS Explorer is now Coinbase.
Bitcoin is the TCP/IP protocol that allows us to transfer value over the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-02-09 16:32:30
I agree, but if the price stops dropping when you sell under the purchased price you end up with less fiat in our pocket to repurchase if you still believe in bitcoin. If you don't believe in bitcoin you should not start this game at all.  
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:55:26
How ?
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:06:50
Are  transactions with in coinbase going through the bitcoin blockchain confirmations? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:23:50
Letting the market pay more fees wouldn't solve the problem either, it would just be a number of times more expensive. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:47:31
That's right. R3 is going to install MySQL and tell all those banks that they are running on the blockchain.

Keep in mind 16 million bitcoins are not in their hands... If the price go to high someone will sell a lot, do drop the price and buy them back for lower price.

Why not using miners to produce heat to heat up things that you need regular heaters, so the cost would be only the hardware. Electricity would be used to produce heat.

What a joke. Roger is talking about Core censorship, but this is not a censorship at all right ?  Can someone start making miners in the US? If China is the only country that makes bitcoin miners, we should also call it Chinacoin instead.

cheaper price would be when there is no transaction fee between miner and user.
Also with segwit and paymant channels miners could get very small transactions on daily, hourly bases with 0 transaction fees. Right now there is a lot of traffic on the network just to send miners payments from pools. Imagine if there is million people mining remotely and want to get payed every day or every hour. You have million transaction on the blockchain. With BU ideology we would generate Gigabytes of data just for remote miners to get their coins. nonsense!  
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:19:41
LOL... Really? This is not even funny. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:25:37
Sounds like we should active segwit
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:10:36
And buy on dip. If it goes deeper, buy even more.

@_date: 2016-03-01 17:57:43
There is no fee needed to create a transactions, and miners can process your 0 fee transaction the same way as they process transactions with high fees. 
Of course they can exclude 0 fee transactions from their mempools, and if all minders excluded them, your transaction will  never be confirmed.
Also, they can process  high fee transactions during large traffic periods first, and after when all the high fee transactions are confirmed, work on the low or 0 fee transactions.

And once again. "Users will buy coins", but what if they wont. Miners will bankrupt quickly. As you see miners should consider long term users benefits, not their own profit. Miners have way more to lose than users. I, as a user can easily sell all my coins and buy something else. Miners investment would be very difficult to sell.

Core provided scaling solution. Why do you think that the only scaling solution is to increase block size?
@_date: 2016-01-08 02:48:49
The 21 million cap is one of the key aspects, and it's not going to change because that would 	negate existence of bitcoin. 
However, it could be possible to add more zeros (1 BTC divided by more parts)  if 2,100,000,000,000,000 units would be not enough in the future.

@_date: 2017-03-28 20:05:20
Do you understand that your calculation makes only sense if you have 1 connection to your node, but that's not the case. Usually you have multiple connections which would multiply your numbers. 
Also keep in mind that there are other uses of the internet  at homes than bitcoin nodes, and 24Mbit ADSL connection is only the download speed, did you forget about the upload? 
Another thing is that Bitcoin is trying to help people in developing countries, and for sure they don't have 24Mbps DSL at their houses.

If that would be be case, he would sell his coins for $1000 and have $1B right now.

you need to start somewhere. In 35 year we will have 10 :)
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:16:07
buy more and wait till the price stabilize...
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:27:51
Yes, let's say every state in US has one, and other countries buy one, it would be really good for the infrastructure. Dump it next to a power plant, and you're good to go. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:24:06
Nope. Retardation is an illness, this is pure speculation and manipulation.   
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:28:35
I agree, but this thing would simplify conversion of other commodities or stocks to Bitcoin, so somebody who has Apple stock would be able to directly convert it to Bitcoin, and I think that's the goal.

@_date: 2016-06-14 18:45:12
I think that's what banks should do right now. Buy bitcoin and make paper notes for offline use. Their rule would be to hold private keys.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:50:36
The bitcoin people are not going to use non-opensource blockchains they are trying to develop. 
By the time they do it( corporate environments require years to come up with an agreement for things like they are trying to do) , bitcoin will be so popular no one would even care about what they do.

If those are the newest 0.098 J/GH 16nm chis, you would be using about 10KW of power. You can calculate how much you would be paying for electricity. 
I think it's less risky to just buy them right now unless you have super cheap or free power. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:23:47
If some miners shut down, the difficulty will drop and other miners will start mining since it will be easier to earn bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:18:32
I'm assuming someone is wishing for the price to be only $400. Missed the bus.  I'm wondering if that person wanted the price to be $200 when it was $400 :)

Good, some other people will buy them quickly for good price.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:30:42
Do you think it's a first time the price is free falling entire day ? I would only suggest to buy more 
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:40:02
Since everyone know the price will go up, the idea is to have bitcoins somehow, by either buying or mining them. Miners won't shutdown, they will keep mining and sell then the price is right for the coins they minded after halving. It's all about the price :D If the price is right, it doesn't matter if you mine 0.1 BTC a day or 0.01 BTC a week. You just sell them when you can make a profit ( immediately or 6 months later)
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:38:57

Normally people do exactly opposite of what they should be doing. They always scarred to buy when price is dipping, and in euphoria of buying when all indicators suggest we are in overbought areas.

Hopefully you bought more when the price was lower.

They are trying to control information as well, but wikileaks still online.. They can't control the bitcoin protocol. They can control services like conbase or circle, but not the bitcoin itself. You always will be able to send bitcoin from the core wallet without any restrictions.

I've had this conversations 10 months ago when the price was ~$250, and some people said "they will wait until the price drop to 100s" And it did drop to 190$ for few hours, came back to $230 for a while, they didn't buy, and now you see what is going on. 
If you willing to invest and hold long time and you are not going to cry a river when we have correction (then buy even more) for some time, buy as soon as possible and hold until you can pay your electrical bill/ mortgage etc with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-06-09 11:57:59

@_date: 2016-06-24 17:28:35
100% agree with you. Also keep in mind other countries are having major economic problems as well, and bitcoin is there for everyone to escape the corrupted and overstimulated systems. Brexit is the only beginning of huge changes in the near future in all economics. Wait till FED start dumping trillions to rescue everyone.

Running a node help the network with blocks and transaction propagation. Also if someone is trying to sync another node it happens faster because there is more sources. The same way like torrent network works, more seeds, faster download.

I know, I'm just against "bitcoin is dead" propaganda :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:20:35
I pretty sure the price will be negative very soon. Everyone would have to pay $$$ not to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:45:48
As long as you don't sell it, you wont lose anything.  I bought bitcoins during the 2013 spike, and never sold them. When we were dropping all 2014 I kept buying for any price (bigger drop, I bought more) I'm very happy now. 
My goal is to have as many Bitcoins as possible. The price is just a factor for me to decide how much I can afford at a moment. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:11:47
Those comments are from Wall Street lovers how hates and didn't invest in bitcoin, so it's expectable to see this hate from them.  
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:31:39
True, but what do you think the market would value bitcoin if the hashing power would be ~ 100 GH/s, ~ 20 tx a day, 5 or less bitcoin exchanges with the volume below 100 USD a day ?
Because all the above are constantly increasing with higher than the price rate, that's why the fair price is higher.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:39:33
Let's say miners add 200% more hashing power. Would this analysis still apply ?
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:14:31

Use all your cash and fiat savings before touching bitcoin.  If you have to money to pay mortgage than cash some bitcoin out, and leave the rest. $1100 is nothing.

If you're going that direction, it would be even easier for Intel as many other companies (ISP, Cert authorises, wifi providers, etc)  to steal your bank and credit card information and use it anywhere.

For you information: Bitcoin is batter money than all fiat currencies combined. Also we can point many use cases where bitcoin is better than gold and solver.

I feel shitty because I didn't buy more when the price was ~$1. I could have cashed out my 401K and retire by now.

@_date: 2017-01-12 12:20:16
Look on Oct 26 2013. We had similar same price drop (from $200 to $175) before going higher. 
it looks like the same pattern right now, just spread in time a little more. I think we will recover to ~$1000 with in less than 3 months.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:43:35
Yes, we might go to $10,000 by end of year.

Look on last the last 2 year markets. We've had 2 corrections like that from ~$500 to ~$320,  next from ~$780 to ~$580. This is another correction from ~$1100 to ~$900. It will stay around $900 for some time before the next bull run.

I can apologize if that improve your life quality.  My point is that bitcoin is not a short term investment, and if you are looking for a quick buck, I hope you lose. But if you believe in bitcoin's values, you will invest and stick with bitcoin for long time. That all I want to tall you.

China's credit is now super expensive after yesterday's changes in rates, so all the money that inflated the price last week is now gone.

And also a drop from what price. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:58:23
So now since  Bitcoin in banned is China, all mining pools will be shut down over there, we can easily active SegWit.
Roger are you on board ? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:06:36
The price of bitgold is also dropping since 1/5, so he is wrong. All cryptos and other digital assets prices are dropped because Chinas credit cost increased drastically on that day, and Chinese speculators pulled CNY back to pay back loans.

it will crash to negative $35 dollars. Bitcoin will pay you in dollars to get bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:17:27
If you have any more cache, but some more now. So when the price go back to $900 you will breakeven instead back to $1110.
Look on Oct 26 2013. We had similar same price drop (from $200 to $175) before going higher. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:19:28
Completely disagree. BTC and LTC will work like one network in near future. SegWit, LN, and atomic swap is going to be on both networks and capacity and speed of both is going to be way higher than all legacy financial systems ( VISA, Mater Card, Banks ) combined.  Bitcoin will be store of value, Litecoin will be micro-transactions network. Just watch.

if you aren't, never sell under 770/EUR. Panicking is the worst thing on bitcoin markets now. Too many people don't understand bitcoin and every time price drops by over $100 they think bitcoin is going to die  and they sell under their price. The story rapids since 2011 every few months.

"A It works a lot like gold in that there is a limited supply. There are only going to be 21 million bitcoins, and right now there have been 14 million that have been released into the world."   This is either 2 years old interview, or he doesn't even know how many bitcoins were already released.  
@_date: 2016-11-09 22:05:46
Sounds like the open bitcoin blockchain is the way to go. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:30:02
So at this point maybe it make sense to create another version 0.13.2 with no blocksize limit + segwit and see if the unlimited side of bitcoin is going to update which would help with segwit activation. And if the core people would not want unlimited blocksize we can we would have segwit activated but unlimited blocks still waiting for activation at 95%.  ideas ?

@_date: 2016-11-16 15:02:03
I agree, but I think higher distribution of large amount of bitcoins means batter price stability long term.
If more people buy 1BTC+ as an investment option, there will be less bitcoins for traders to play with the price in the future. 
There are traders with high amount of bitcoins that can move the price drastically. So, I would rather see them selling it, and average person buying it, than other way around. If the price is too high too fast the average person wouldn't be able of gather that much.
However, small bubbles ($50-200) are good to turn peoples attention and buy some more, and force traders to sell ( make profit) 
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:50:50

If someone has a lot of savings in their notes and doesn't want to use banks to hold those savings, bitcoin can help to avoid problems like this one where government bans banks notes, and force people to exchange to something else.

fungibility = exchangeability so it's easier to  two-way peg if you know what that is. 
Bitcoin without segwit is like the internet without routers. It's like one gigantic network without easy option to connect to other subnetworks.   
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:35:44

@_date: 2016-11-22 15:52:57
Are you talking about segwit activation ? 
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:22:48
That's good. We want the price to be achievable for batter distribution. If it would jump to lets say $10K in a week. Less people would be able to buy higher amounts. Slow growth with small jumps and drops (&lt;$100) in between is a perfect scenario. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:50:33
This is it. We better buy some coins since they are still under $1000. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:52:26
I see you know a lot about segwit... not.
Fist; it takes some time to update nodes. At this moment almost 30% of the network is updated 
Second; the actually activation just started, and going up. 
Third; we have 12 months to go to 95% of mining supports it before it expires. 
If this is slow for you, you should get a job in some large corporation.

@_date: 2016-11-18 23:19:40

There is x amount of bitcoin for sell on exchanges. If more people wants to buy, the price goes up. If more people sell the price goes done. 
There is a lot of traders that are making profit from buying and selling bitcoins, and they hold a lot bitcoins and cash. If they think the trend based on news will encourage regular people to  buy, traders buy even more ahead and move the price significantly. Once they realize there is not enough bullish they sell. 
What is more important for long term investor is not to react to quick spikes. Buy when the price is dropping. It will take coins from traders on the down price moments. They pretty much always re-buy when the price drop to the level they are looking for. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:36:20

Well... since we have a software (nodes) running on thousands of computes, why can't the nodes measure network latency and create a value that could define a block size ?  So the network performance could drive the block size, not the people. The same way as we adjust difficulty to keep blocks 10 separated, we should adjust block size to keep legacy on some level.

Very agree. I'm using layer 7 firewall with SSL keys stored on the firewall side, and the firewall see all traffic not encrypted. If would see right away if my PC transfer data I (as I user) didn't initiate. 
I think if even we have that spying capabilities in our hardware. It's still not is use, otherwise someone would already detect that activity. Also crackers community would use that already to execute attacks. 
I recommend to use mini servers ( such as raspberry pi 3) to run bitcoin nodes.

I think we need bitcoins to be spread through more people. There are traders with too many of them and they can manipulate  the price easily. To me that drop has some relations to Bitfinex maintenance.

The HF would need introduce an intelligent system, not just a dumb size change that would have to be changed again in the future. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:02:59
Soon with 1MB block size we would be able to make thousands and thousands of transactions a second, and the bitcoin's blockchain would be a settlement repository. 
This just proves why segwit is way more important for bitcoin than bigger blocks. Even with 10-50MB blocks we wouldn't be able to handle future transactions if every transaction would be on-chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:29:31
I checked several blocks from today and all of them had over 0.5BTC in fees.
Let's say you have limited amount of hours a day/week/month you can mine, and free hardware. What would be the decision maker for you to start mining for example 3 days a week? Wouldn't that be the time you when there is a lot of traffic on the network you want to mine?
@_date: 2016-12-31 02:50:16
Yes, it will. The run is going to start in about 12 hours. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:14:33
Let us know if you're all set, or still need some help. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:32:21
I strongly believable that it really doesn't make sense to change the block size to any permanent value since there will be a different need in x number of months/years, and we would have to hard fork again ( really bad idea!)
We really need to develop a measurement system of the network performance and load to make sure the block is adjusted automatically under specific circumstances to avoid all the problems we're seeing right now and future hard forks because of that issue.
For sure the bitcoin network (bandwidth, storage and computation) is going to increase its capacity, so the block size should be able to flex to the network performance. The same way we measure fees and transactions in mempool to set priorities, we need to measure block propagation, network legacy and nodes capacity to set appropriate values for the block size and update the size every x mount of blocks.     
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:46:10
And it's opensource :)

@_date: 2016-11-15 23:22:00
But if not there will be less miners and lower difficulty for other (home) miners to join. As long as bitcoin has any value, someone will want to mine it and collect reward and/or fees. It's all about numbers. As long as miners make profit they will keep doing what they are doing.

keep in mind that probably more than 50% people that bought bitcoins after 2014 weren't even aware of that technology back than. 
Also check the hash-rate, amount of transactions a day, a number of  exchanges + volume worldwide etc, overall adoption and awareness.

And this is a great rhetorical question that is building bitcoin  "Bitcoin is broken, nice one, mission accomplished huh?"
Is Bitcoin broken because somebody is flooding the network? You assume that, but the fact is that the network is still up and running. No matter how hight the blocksize is, someone with big bucks will be able to flood it with transactions ( good for miners not for users ). So the solution is to build a logic that is resistant to Bitcoin DDoS, and not to cry like a sissy girl when fees are going higher because of increased confirmation time. Focus on ideas what to do rather than dump questions like "Bitcoin is broken, nice one, mission accomplished huh?" that doesn't help anyone.

Recently those big spikes were cased by hashrate drops. Right now blocks are generated faster than 10 min apart which helps cleaning up the mempool.  
Look on this   When the blue line drops below red line, we have blocks being created slower than 10 min on average, and with a high transaction demand they build up in the mempool  very fast.

If government couldn't kill torrent, it wont be able to kill bitcoin. It might make bitcoin more difficult to use, it it wont stop me from sending bitcoins to whoever I want. 
Nay governments will find bitcoin useful to help with crashing economics and fiat currencies, so just watch how adoption racking up everywhere.

Hehe, if gold would act like our lovely fiat currency with inflation attached, today it would have negative value.
There is a reason why gold is valuable after thousands of years. That's why bitcoin has more value people don't see right now than all fiat currencies. Bitcoin is not going anywhere, and one day once banks can't add numbers to theirs balance sheets fast nought due to HDD limitation :), people will understand why we have Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-12-27 22:56:44
The phenomenon of bitcoin is that a significantly more people on the planet can trade bitcoin than anything else, so the price can really go either directions with no technical logic whatsoever. 
I think there is so much expectation for $2000 per bitcoin early next year that will drive the price throughout resistances quickly.

@_date: 2016-11-03 23:25:58
Well, I think typical bitcoin believer doesn't necessary focus on daily price. I think the main mission is to collect as many bitcoins as the person can afford. If the bitcoin blockchain take off one day as a core of global finance and trust, $300, $800 or $2000 would be just funny numbers to look at. 
Unfortunately there are many bitcoin traders with high amount of bitcoins that are looking for pure profit, and they don't care what the price is. As long as they can make more "money" out of that system, they don't care about bitcoin's vision and long term investment.   
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:53:56

1.2 MB blocks :) Really, why would I listening to someone who is willing to risk bitcoin to split to add 200KB to the block ? What he is saying doesn't make any sense. 
The only conscious reason why we could hard fork bitcoin is when we agree on a solution that would be a permanent solution, and we would never have to come back to the block size debate.
 I would see an automatic blocksize calibration when determined conditions are are attained such as network legacy, blocks propagation time, number of transactions in mempool etc.

Perfect scenario would be:

- Everyone is going to talk about Bitcoin going to $100K
- Price drop to ~$7000
- A lot of people buy for the first time.
- Price slowly starting to go up again. 
- $10K again around Thanksgiving 
- More people buying again.
We just dont want the price to go up too quickly.

If everything would be so hard and bureaucratic to improve in bitcoin protocol, we would end up on the same boat all banks are. They use technology from 15 years ago because it's super difficult and expensive to change anything. I bet most of people that are complaining about changes, didn't believe if bitcoin is going to work out back in 2009. Those people will complain no matter what you do, or not to do. Please provide better solution for our current technical problems rather then just say what others are doing wrong.

It will easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:59:11
50% now. 5% next Monday, another 5% the following Monday and so on. After 2 months you will have an average price. Don't sell anything for at least 2 years no matter of the price.

What do you smoke ?
@_date: 2015-08-01 01:44:49
In next decade the protocol, nodes and wallets are going to be improved multiple times and probably make it completely resistant to any sort of attacks or hacks. I'm pretty sure bitcoin addresses are going to be used during transaction period, and once block is confirmed, they could be transferred to another form of encryption.   
Look where we were 20 years ago with technology, and where we are now.

I agree, but also I think that's the beauty of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:59:02
The best strategy for Bitcoin is to always buy, no matter why, what, when  etc...
- When price is going high buy less
- When price is dropping buy more
- When price doesn't change a lot buy the same amount you bought last time.
After 14 months and 2 days you will be in profit no matter what the price at the moment is..
Always keep some extra fiat for unexpected dips to be able to buy even more.
When price goes up 7+% with in 23 hours, wait 2-3 days before you buy.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:23:30
LOL... there is already government in Bitcoin called. developers and miners.

This attack wouldn't happen to gain anything related to bitcoin, it would be to destroy bitcoin.
Destroying bitcoin would give the attacker nothing.  For sure most of current bitcoin users will move everything to another system. 
Whoever is planning 51% attack on the bitcoin network, should also consider shutting down the internet, and good luck with that.

Does this really matter? Today from 1-7, tomorrow from 7-30, than 30 to 100, etc. In 2 - 3 years several thousand would be aware of bitcoin and potentially putting fraction of their income into btc. As long as there is growth, that is a good news.

@_date: 2015-08-01 02:47:24
not 2 week, it's every 2016 blocks. if block are 10 min apart, then yes 2 weeks, but if we add 4 times more  hashing power,  difficulty will be adjusted in about 3 days.

Unless you have unused solar power etc..

@_date: 2015-07-09 17:26:05
What about if we build a decentralized off-chain services that exchanges private keys and it's directly linked to the bitcoin blockchain ?
Where is will, there is a way. Nothing will kill bitcoin as long as people keep optimizing it. 
I remember times ~2001 when it was a big deal to download few mp3s from the internet. I thought, we will never be able to send videos over the internet. Where we are now?
@_date: 2015-08-07 23:38:18
The point is to use bitcoin to increase the adoption. Imagine one day everyone converts fiat into bitcoin for only one purchase. Step by step, but people will start using it once it's easier to spend.  
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:19:31
I think any amount of transaction shouldn't hold confirmations. There is some redesign needed. We can increase block size to 10GB and someone we enough resources would be able to clog the network one day.
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:03:32
Huge if true 
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:20:22
In theory bitcoin is perfect, we only have technical problems we need to solve to take off. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:31:03
So buy more before super bowl. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:56:17
Microtransactions. Digital world needs smaller units then a penny for value transfer. There are off chain services, you can use to send $0.0001 to someone or something with 0.00000000 transactions fees.  
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:42:56
Awesome! This is what bitcoin is all about, the freedom of your financial choice. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:53:35
You can't do that because you wouldn't have enough storage to check and record all possible addresses. We have not enough sand on the Earth to produce transistors to build enough storage to keep that data at the current technology level.     
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:49:59

@_date: 2015-08-08 16:46:58
Which exchanges ?
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:48:05
Correct, with 1 second blocks we would adjust difficulty in about 33 min instead 2 weeks. In order to reach next halving way sooner someone would have to keep adding hashing power multiple times a day for several days. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:38:35
I'd rather use my cell phone, but for people who don't see that as an

@_date: 2015-07-24 14:07:54
Forget about it... I want to keep buying them cheaper. Below $300 would be great for one more year. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:29:11
I would buy for $1000 now, and the next $1000 spread through next 2-3 weeks. You will end up with the average price on the upper trend. The test $700 reserve for some major dips. I think we can still go to mid 5000s by mid December.  
@_date: 2015-07-18 02:13:48
"it is 1981.. people will be streaming 1080p videos from the Internet" You would laugh even more if someone would tell you that 30 years ago.
Don't worry, in 10 years we will be processing 3 million transactions a second with no problems.

Would would mining ever stop?
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:45:02
If this was/is attack it seems to fail form my point of view. I last 3 days I sent several transactions and the confirmation time was between 15 and 40 minutes.

@_date: 2015-07-08 20:27:34
Why not switch from euros to bitcoin? If you use, lets say coinbase to buy bitcoins, and you have another 100 people using lets say coinbase, you wouldn't see any delays in confirmation when sending them coins. There are multiple ways to send bitcoins off the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:16:15

Well you all wrong! There is less then 0.1 bitcoin in that game that is happening right now. Look on the wallet bellow. Whoever is spamming the network already has resources to execute it, and that person doesn't add any transaction fees so the cost of this is ~ $50 maybe. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:52:07
I think, instead, they will make it stronger by showing us were we need to optimize the protocol. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:44:58
The current speed of Bitcoin network is 400 peta hashes a second. It doesn't equal 400 petaflops. Bitcoin hash rate is generated by ASIC chips. Obama is requesting to build a CPU based computer. A 1000 petaflops supercomputer would generate a lot of hashes, so I don't think it will be used for bitcoin mining.

Turn off the power at your house for a week, see if you still worry about money.  Nobody would care about any kind of money if  power is out nationwide.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:37:50
First, you don't put majority of your money into BTC yet. It's not stable enough, and not accepted by the most. You might see odd price amplitudes due to very low liquidly. Once we have $100bn market cap (currently ~$3bn) , we can think about stabilization. This is a long term investment that might benefit in 5-10 years. 
What I would do, I would hold all bitcoins you have, and try gain money for your expenses from other sources.

He just wants to cause panic sell and buy for lower price.  Bitcoin is too strong to react on posts like that. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:58:40
This is a signal of all signals people. Do the needful. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 03:09:24
critical for what ?
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:32:36
Well well well.... Now the question is how soon before Bitcoin is going to be hodl on the exchange just for the trade period, maybe even for the execution time only. This is very exciting. People finally will be able to trade without the risk of hack etc.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:58:42
So wont see them in 2-3 years.

They need to make profit somehow. Buy directly from an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:13:14
Including the power being used by full nodes and the internet bandwidth as well as the cost of the hardware and the further recycle of all bitcoin network components etc ?

That's OK, I think everyone gets her point. Not everyone is a poet.

If the price double and the hash rate stays the same I don't think anyone would stop mining because of halving. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:18:42
I don't think they were capable to develop their own solution is such a short time with other 2000 clients agreement.  They must be using some other already existing blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 04:20:11
FINE :)
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:59:16
sounds like need to buy more of them before they become difficult to get.
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:16:09
After 5.5 hours the difficulty will be adjusted and blocks will be again generated every 10 min.  
@_date: 2016-02-09 23:44:27
Yes, I'm very new. I just bought my first 10 bitcoins to start using it.

I'm sure you are way smarter and you can come up some genius ideas that will scale bitcoin infinitely. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:01:21
Sure, but you would make $.50 an hour. Would you still be happy ?

The idea of mining pools should be eliminated. Everyone who mines for bitcoin should be rewarded every time the block is found, not just those who used particular pool that found the block. There will be no such thing as 51% attack, and it will also eliminate concentration of mining power.
With 1Thps I want to use my own full node, instead one of the pool. At this moment I can't because I will never be able to find a block. I want to be rewarded by the amount to power I'm adding to the network. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:20:27

In a short term I see LTC and ETH gaining 200%+, but long term 5+ years bitcoin will be the best option.
I would buy LTC and ETH and wait till bitcoin activates SegWit and LN, and other solutions to make sure there will be no capacity problems in the future. Than I would sell LTC and ETH and buy bitcoin again.

Yeah, and everyone would love to accept your gold while starving to death since no food can be distributed without power these days.    
When we have nationwide EMP you would not care about any methods of payment. You would be in woods trying to hunt something to eat and make a fire. 
The only paymant option after that event would be food, not gold for sure.

That's fu.. up, they are going to give away gold for the paper crap. They will never be able to pay off the debt, it will just help temporary. In 10 year they will be out of cash again, but with no gold. Why not default, and start all over the same way Germany did multiple times in the history. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:46:37
Why would they need to? Should the market control it?

If you want to sell now after Bitcoin being 75% down from the top, you are out of your mind. Either hodl or buy more if you have extra fiat to get rid of. 
Yes, sure we can go do ~$3000, but you might be at your crapper at the moment, and the price might bounce back so quickly you might never going to be able to rebuy for those level.

I don't think people care about ETFs or Futures. I'm pretty sure the market is driven by bigger players (traders and capitals), and people just fallow big price swings. 
There is sooo much good news about Bitcoin in last 3-8 months and the price is constantly going down, which tells me no news can drive the price anymore, it's all about BIG $$$ entering or exiting the market.

I really don't care. Everything is bullish to me in that space. This technology just started to be considered a global carrier of value. The current dollar value of it whether it's $5000, $3000 or $15000 is still a fraction of where this thing is going. I keep accumulating since 2014. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:39:25
Whether you buy Bitcoin or not, we are f..ked anyways. Why not than load up with something that can potentially survive the upcoming debt burst ?

You can pay as much for transactions as you want, but it doesn't mean it's a optimal amount. Right now you can easy get $0.20 fee transaction go trough with in 10-30 min. If you willing to donate more to miners you can pay $1000 per transaction, it's all up to you.

I don't think we can go to that levels because it would mean there will be no buys at all at exchanges. I would consider the price to go to $0. 
Either there will be enough support on levels above $1000 or below I would see total crash.

Well... my price target was a joke, because nobody can predict the Bitcoin price. There is soooo much to gain and lose in this space  nobody in their right mind would want to sell right now. The only reason of bigger price drop would be another force sell by biggest players to only rebuy at a lower point. However this could happen so quickly I don't think it's worth trying to risk re-entering the market at lower prices.

Keep in mind that they would never be able to own most of bitcoin since not all of them are for sell, and still over 4 million to be mined.
If they want to buy too much, the price will go to stratospheric levels and they wouldn't be able to afford to keep buying it.
There are many bitcoin holders that aren't going to sell most of their Bitcoin for any price.

By the time we get there, Bitcoin core will add more decimal-points, so 1 bitcoin wouldn't be divided by  100,000,000, but possibly 1,000,000,000,000.

It was a short term investment between mid and end of 2013. Right now everyone is waiting to see what is the bottom of the price . If we test ~$200 few more times some investors will realize that the price will not go any lower and they will start buying. I think we need to wait till mid next year and the price will start moving forward.

Speculation on natural resources and food ingredients by stock markets should be banned. It only causes more inflation, and simply transfer our money to speculators. For example: Why one day I have to pay for gas to my car $4 and 6 month later(with no change on the oil market such as more oil rigs or more resources) $1.99. I could go with the list almost forever. 
Investors/speculators should only be only allow to dump theirs capital surplus into stocks, bonds, fixed assets or crypto currencies that benefits everyone. For example: dumping trillions of dollars into bitcoin will not hurt anyone, dumping trillions into Microsoft stocks will not hurt anyone either, it will only cause more investments and higher innovation.
When stock markets dumps trillions into OIL stock the price of GAS will be let say $10 and everyone will have to pay for that speculation, only a small group of people will benefit... and that's not OK

Keep in mind that they sill discover new sources of oil, also oil can be used once. Once you burn it in your car and someone else, you need new unit.
Bitcoin will not have new sources of supply, and it can be reused an infinite number of times.

Wait till the price is going to go up significantly again. You will see 15 post a min about the price etc.  Bitcoin is not only about the price. There is a lot going on in that space right now, but those people that are working on development don't have time to participate in those conversations.  
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:21:26
At some point miners with get more profit from transactions fees than discovering new coins. With about 5000 transactions per block the reward would be over 1 BTC from transaction fees per block.

@_date: 2019-09-20 13:42:03
I don't think it's a bad news. It only means more market liquidity all over the place. As long as we have regular exchanges all around the World available to everyone, anyone can play the game. The most important thing is that there is no centralized price discovery place like in gold and silver markets. Gold and silver are only contracts being exchanged on 1-2 exchanges. I can really go and buy $10B worth of silver, and won't even move the price by a penny. Try to do that to Bitcoin. The amount to available Bitcoins will decrease instantly and the price will rise on that exchange.
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:06:35
And you're saying that anyone would be able to start producing fingerprints. Anyone can also start guessing private keys and pull coins from other wallets.

@_date: 2015-04-13 02:22:16
Well... how you know what's 100% of bitcoin price? It would be $10000000, so going from ~250 to over 1000 is still a fraction of the whole. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 02:00:28
more like it will be negative 
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:50:30

We're doing the same this year. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:24:37
Right now it's better to buy $400 worth of bitcoins than mine them by something that will cost you $400, unless you have free electricity. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:05:36
What else they want to tax? maybe TCP connections as well ?
@_date: 2015-04-03 15:30:13
It's not about 2-3 % fees, it's about inflation that kills the middle class, it's about an infinite money supply that puts countries in debt, and by taxes generations need to pay for something they didn't spend money for. Currently 1/3 of my income goes way in taxes. My kids will have to pay 1/2 or even more in taxes. Our grand kids will have to work like slaves to be able to pay taxes otherwise they will be homeless. Is that the future you're looking for?
@_date: 2015-09-19 02:24:17
Great, but no one can use Apple unless Apple agrees with that. And if your credit card or paypal is not going to like what you're doing, your account will be terminated... Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:40:33
Very true. I can't wait to see how they are going to create decentralized, and open to everyone blockchain without reward. :)

As you might know Bitcoin is still under experimental phase, and multiple things associated are being researched. Lighting network, offchain transactions, automatic adjustment of transaction fees, etc will tune the network at some point, so no concerns like you have will be valid any longer. 
Back in 1995 you couldn't stream even MP3 over the internet. Right now you can watch netflix on multiple HD TVs at home at the same time using $50/month connection.  
Bitcoin is only 6 years old. Give it another 6 years and you will see things do don't even dream about now.

Since there is more and more Bitcoin uses it's really hard to say who is driving the price. I'm sure forks have a lot to do with it, but I'm pretty sure it's not the only reason.

- If an exchange own 1 bitcoin address with 100,000 bitcoins and the exchange has 4 million uses, you consider that 100,000 bitcoins be "owned" by a lot of people, not 1 person. 
- Own P2P exchanges take over centralized exchanged this statistic will drastically change since users will own their coins, not the exchange.
- With bitcoin value going up those who is holding a lot of Bitcoins  start spending or selling them.

A blockchain developed by google will be like a gmail. All data will be centralized similar to what database is but with some extra permissions features... 
Should't google just develop their own internet transfer protocol or email protocol, maybe even new HTTP?? LOL.
Useless wast of time. 
I think it will take them a while after wasting millions of dollars that they need to build something on top of the Bitcoin blockchain instead of trying their own.

Most of bitcoin investments started less then a year ago. Just wait next 6-10 months and you will be some spectacular things. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:22:00
The formula reflects the profitability of Bitcoin mining with a recoupment period of under 6 months.
The formula takes account of the price of the most profitable hardware for mining (Hardware_Cost), expenditure on electric power (Enerdgy_Costs), and the quantity of mined Bitcoin (Mined_BTC)
Calculation of mined Bitcoin over 6 months:
Time - is computation time in seconds (average time for difficulty to increase);
n - is the quantity of periods with differing degrees of difficulty over 6 months;
R - is the reward per block;
Diff(x) - is a function to determine the difficulty of any future period, based on historical data.
HashRate - is the power of the hardware used. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:43:56
This is bullish 
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:23:45
If they really start buying significant amount of bitcoin (worth 10s of millions of dollars) we can see an interesting price movement.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:38:13
I guess because they can.

So agree, I wish I just could send bitcoin to any cell phone number anywhere and bitcoin would be either available for the owner of the number or converted to whatever the device that is hosting the number accepts. 
If I could just travel to middle Africa and transfer bitcoin to someone over independent wireless connection that would be really revolutionary. I know all phones would have to have some new sort of protocol implemented, but maybe one day. I think 21 is working on something like that where every SIM card has embedded private key.

@_date: 2015-11-20 20:07:27
I agree with your agreement. If 100.000 people would be like us, the price could be above $6522.22 per coin.

"Yet, the fungibility of Bitcoin is at risk because, in increasing instances, one bitcoin does not equal another." this is one of the stupidest thing I've seen about bitcoin in a long time.  
Where those ideas are coming from ?
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:03:07
90% of that 1% are Bitcoin exchanges with many millions of user accounts.
Every time you buy on Coinbase, a new Bitcoin address is created, so, 1 address doesn't mean 1 person at all.

Keep in mind that you don't need to use blockchain to send multiple bitcoin transactions. I can transfer 50BTC to my  account and send 1000 tips to multiple people which won't cause any traffic on the bitcoin blockchain.
In the short future  combination of technologies will allow to transfer more transactions than VISA, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express combine together.    
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:23:55
Well it's your decision, but for sure we will see upper 700s very soon.

Here we have a solution for another bitcoin death. I'm wondering what would be the next reason for Bitcoin to die.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:00:41
TCP/IP hasn't change for 30+ years, and we built internet on top of the unchanged and managed protocol... so. I'm pretty sure there is a much bigger changes bitcoin will be mainstreamed then other open source crypto will take. 
Fully managed and non-open source crypt currencies will be no different then the current financial system where someone can change supply any time, can block people from access the protocol etc...
For those reasons I disagree with you.  
@_date: 2015-11-20 03:28:55
You sell, we buy.

I agree. For sure bitcoin will pass $1000 one day and will stay above $1000 as it stays about $1 which was a target back in 2011. 
Bitcoin has a potential to be worth $10.000+ by 2020.

If you believe in something, or what to have something and save your earnings to buy it, I don't see a reason my not buying it even if it's a big deal for you. All I'm trying to say that not everyone is making $80K+ a year and have $200 like that, and it's a big deal to buy something extra for $200 for those people.

I agree with you, but I cannot understand and explain to myself that something someone created out of nothing should represent any value to anyone. All fiat currencies are only a promise to pay off their debt they have been created out of. If it's impossible to pay-off the debt due to multiple reasons, those units of "value" should not even exist because they are nothing else but just a promise that economy will keep growing to cover the currency supply. If the economy stops growing, the whole concept collapses.  Are we sure the economy will grow forever ?

I agree that the only thing I would see as a reason to drug the price to 0 is a total infrastructure failure which a think would be already discovered, but you never know. That's why I think everyone should focus on building stronger and stronger infrastructure rather then watching the price 24/7. 
Whoever was involved in the project in early days should make decisions quickly and get rid of all those block size debates that are taking so much time and energy. Sometimes I feel I'm working in a giant corporation rather then open source community.

@_date: 2015-11-11 03:21:28
It doesn't matter. The fact is that you're going to have ~ 0.25 BTC. Hold it for at least 2 years. Never look on bitcoin as a source of a quick and easy profit, always buy coins that you're not going to need to use or cash out for at least 2 years. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:36:12
At some point ~5 years there will be no price of bitcoin, it will be just bitcoin. Other things would be priced in bitcoin so let's say  1 oz of gold would be 0.01 BTC, $1 would be 0.000002 btc, etc. The BTC supply will be always known so it's a perfect fulcrum for BIPM

The upcoming financial/debt crisis will spike the price more then 62%. Also I think once big investors  realize the potential of bitcoin and start investing, they will bring the price up.  Next think I can imagine as a price driver would be the implementation of the lightning network and allowing thousands of transactions a second/ not only ~3 which will prevent from the recent spam attacks and delays in the future.

By 2093 bitcoin will be for sure transformed to another form, and running on top of existing protocol, so cracking sha256 will not get them anywhere. If you put some sort of 4096 bit key on top of existing infrastructure where every wallet has additional keys, than no one can crack the core system.

Yes, it is important issue, but I don't think it's extremely difficult to solve. Blockchain and minders could be used for transaction verification only. The actual transactions could be stored in another location signed by minders. Each block will have a stamp from blockchain. We could have some sort of P2P RAID where not everyone needs to have all transactions. The transactions could be store on usenet or anywhere as long as they packaged and signed by blockchain.

The queue is over 10K transactions where most people use 0.0001 fee so their transactions will be processed first. With that low fee you're going to need to wait a while to get that first confirmation. After the first every block should give you another confirmation.

In theory you can lose all your bitcoins if that is true. Someone can have all your private keys. But also if that is true the current IT needs to collapse since nothing can be private anymore so, I wouldn't panic very much. Just generate private keys offline and move all BTC into it.

:) That's why you build services such as changetip where transactions can be processed off blockchain. Once regulations are establish, you can open your own BTC bank that everyone integrates with and transactions will be on your node with 0 delay. To transfer BTC from your bank to my back we would have to use blockchain, as simple as that.

Of course everyone can do anything, but because they can, it doesn't mean they will do. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:43:22
I agree, if they already invested in big mining farms it doesn't make a lot of sense for them to sell large amount of coins and drop the price even more. Also I think now mining is spreed between more people, so no single investor is getting a lot BTC from the pool. 
I think the price is being driven by those who have 5000+ coins.

keep in mind that there are people will thousands of bitcoins that want to make a profit on buying and selling them. Because 1000 other people are buying fractions of 1 bitcoin, it doesn't mean the price will go constantly go up. It will eventually once the floor is built and those that sold their coins for higher price will start buying them again. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:23:59
LOL, if that would be be the real costs the harhrate wouldn't be dropping right now.

Bitcoin is an ownership of data in the blockchain. All you need to do is to print private key to the data you own. If you don't have private keys to the data, you either don't own it, or the data doesn't exist. So, you can't print bitcoin, you only can print "access keys" to the data you own.  
So all Banks would have to do is to own bitcoin (buy them, mine them, whatever) and then print keys on banknotes. However they would have to encrypt those private keys to prevent people from moving attached bitcoins to another address(remove value of those banknotes), but I see it complete doable

I also bought a pizza for 10000 BTC 6 years ago. Now it's getting to expensive for me. Please lets hard fork for that as well so I can have my 10000 bitcoins back. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:11:55
how about now ?

@_date: 2015-02-20 16:40:24
Why someone would want to take it down? It was on CNN so I guess someone had to approve it before broadcasting it. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:27:57
In 10 years you're going to have something you can use to pay for most of things so you basally just investing. I wish I could switch 401K to BTC, I'm 33. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:58:40
Never... Do you have more questions ?
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:53:18
Don't worry. Around May 2020 they will be calling you "a genius" after price suppresses $100K.

Can't tell until we stay for a week above $6500
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:19:10
I'm waiting for $50 per BTC since 2013
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:54:28
How much time you have everyday to watch the price? If not much I would by weekly. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:47:02
Keep in mind. $$$ doesn't represent value. It's only a medium of exchange.

Maybe start with google before you come to reddit.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:12:43
I suggest to buy now and after Aug 1st. ETF rejection was supposed to drag the price as well, and it didn't happen.   
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:58:58
When bitcoin market cap overtake $1T, there will be no pumps and dumps like we see today.  2% daily change will be a huge move.  
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:55:25
Watch what is going to happen with Etherium in next 6 months and you will know. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:27:56
Imagine if Bitcoin would be worth $500,000 and we see $1000 drop ( less than 0.5% ) what people are going to say :)
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:52:40
Why not 84 ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:18:52
I guess he wants to buy it cheaper. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:55:20
If you think about 2+ years investment, yes, it's a good time to buy now, and every time you have some extra $$$ to invest in the future. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 03:19:08
Finally I can sell all my ETH
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:06:44

Is there anything different in that wallet than all others we should pay attention on ?  
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:48:39
Yeap, he was against bitcoin less than 6 months ago. I guess people start waking up slowly.  I'm wondering when Warren Buffett is going to change his statement for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:17:04
In US dollars or Bolivares ?

I predict all those prediction are not predictable.

What about if I have another HTTP server running on port 80 on my IP. This is not a good idea for networks that have multiple servers or VMs.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:49:17
He was buying in 2017 all the way. Did you sell any last year?
@_date: 2016-07-28 13:05:05


They do, it's called fractional reserve. And they "print" way more than FED.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:24:48
Hopefully Bitcoin ETF is never approved by SEC, and Bitcoin companies start their own commission. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:28:32
If you don't need this 30K back for at least 2-3 years, than yes, invest it. I would spread that 30K between 3-5 months. Buy on weekly bases ( usually Sunday seems to be the best day to buy) and when the price dips buy extra. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:27:20
two weeks 
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:44:10
Please! don't approve any ETFs ever. We will build a new separate system

you would need to brainless to sell right now.

Can I use this to donate WikiLeaks ?
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:33:07
As long as you're 100% sure the price won't drop in next month or so, invest all right now.
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:23:28
Not true, they can also mine them"
I like this:
"A central-bank-issued bitcoin would be a means for policy makers to completely control the amount of money in the economy, much like full-reserve banking. That’s not possible right now, because private banks can create money on their own."
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:11:02
"They" can't increase the block size, but they would extend 21 cap??? Yeah in million years... not. Forget about it
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:17:49
What time ? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:03:01
If you look on 100 years history that applies for everything because you technically might lose everything no matter of your investment. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:08:37
– You deposit 	$100,000 	Your bank loans someone else 	$90,000
– That person deposits 	$90,000 	Their bank loans someone else 	$81,000
– That person deposits 	$81,000 	Their bank loans someone else 	$72,900
– That person deposits 	$72,900 	Their bank loans someone else 	$65,610
– That person deposits 	$65,610 	Their bank loans someone else 	$59,049
– That person deposits 	$59,049 	Their bank loans someone else 	$53,144
– That person deposits 	$53,144 	Their bank loans someone else 	$47,829
– And so on 			
Ultimately, your initial $100,000 can grow into $1,000,000 with a 10 percent reserve requirement.
As you see you have $900,000 more in circulation, and that's not "printing" ???
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:05:15
5 more to go
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:21:29
I agree, but I think it's not true that it is not true. Let's say tomorrow 1 BTC is $1000, I'm sure those who did shut down their miners will turn them on. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:49:16
Even it could go down a bit more ( or not), 83% drop from ATH is always a pretty good discount to accumulate BTC.
Getting BTC at $7K, $6K, $5K, $4K, $3K or $2.5K wouldn't matter at during the next bull run. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:45:45
My crystal ball says to ignore RSI. I see price going to $6200, then dropping to $5500, and going $7500 after that with in next 3-4 months. 
Should it trust RSI or crystal ball ?

Oh yes. $3000 this weekend.

does your mom have millions of $$$ to invest in Bitcoin and 7M followers as well ?
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:44:38
And WE the please can also buy cheaper! Keep buying every time media is trying to FUD you.  
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:33:28
I will bet 7 BTC with you on this.
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:41:51
Agree, cant wait 
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:52:42
money is not money either. It's just a piece of paper people accept for their work and can exchange for material goods. Right now there is almost no paper involved, everything is electronic and you just believe in numbers you have on your account, and you don't even know where that account is. Money is nothing else but just representation of value in the form that some institutions can produce, manipulate and store in any amount. Other people have to work, work, work to get something 0.001% population can just automatically create. That is extremely fair. Money needs to go away.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:31:38
No one asked or forced those people to put theirs BTC into that exchange... 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:23:12
I disagree. The value has been going up not much faster than the hash-rate and adoption. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:53:32
Finally. I thought you were never going to do it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:53:31
What would be the difference? Rather than monthly subscription, you would pay for data. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:25:20
Some traders sold to bring the price down as low as possible to rebuy for lower price. Just hold and look for the recovery very soon. I would even buy more if you are planning to invest..  However the drop might be not over and it might go to ~$2500 today or in next 2 days. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:52:54
Bullish AF

It's happening in Venezuela right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:42:05
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:58:02
That would be the stupidest thing they could do. Let's say price go up by 500% with in few months. Before more people by mining rigs, they could use those to still make profit.  
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:33:41
Should we also stop the internet so they can't hack anymore ?
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:57:02
Do you really compare Bitcoin to tulips?

Does it still make any sense to connect to the internet in 2017 ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:55:22
The best way to learn is by not using the technology you want to learn about LOL.
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:30:24
Everyone is losing money all the time due to inflation anyways so I think they will be OK with 50% less bitcoin rewarded for the work. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:30:12
It will be awesome no matter what.

you will have plenty of sleep when you dead... now jut focus on this. I'm sure your name will be written in the history books like other big names that contributed to change the World for better.  Just keep converting coffee into the Bitcoin code :)
