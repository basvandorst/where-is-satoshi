Syscoin, But be warned, it doesn't seem to have any adoption yet.

This one was 35-40% from my perspective.
I only mentioned 25% because I thought someone quoted that number. 
To be honest I'm still not used to the price being above 10k. 
I use coin market cap. What I saw (without checking was 20k maximum 12-13k minimum...)
8/20 = 40/100
7/20 = 35/100
So from my perspective it was 35-45%
I just mentioned 25% because I saw it in some other comment involving a crash. We always say that bitcoin is very volatile. That's part of it.

I checked it on the original site. It's true! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:38:12
I had almost called a crash down to $10,000 when we were at $8,000....
As a joke.
Do the math.

What a douche!
Reported. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:32:30
25% Isn't a crash..
80% is a crash...
That's normal.

Not all the food goes bad in 2-3 days. 
In fact most caloric dense foods take a very long time to deteriorate. Sugar, rice, pasta, serial and honey can last a very long time.
Canned food if stored properly could last a lifetime.

I've been in seriously stressful situations and I can still remember my old alphanumeric 25 character code that I had on my computer more than 10 years ago.
If you repeat it enough times, you'll remember it forever (Or until your brain deteriorates, at which point money is worthless).
  
Just repeat it everyday. Maybe make a little routine out of it. Repeat it in your head and write it on a piece of paper, then burn the paper. After a couple of months, maybe make sure you remember it at the first day of each month.
You will remember it forever, even if it's 50 words.

Buttcoin poster spotted! 
Beep! Boop! I'm not a bot.

If they don't properly understand the risks and benefits of bitcoin, they shouldn't invest. 
Make sure it's their decision, or if you really want to "save" people, buy bitcoin and give it to them.

The punishment should also fit the crime. 
Otherwise, if someone speeds, we should cut off the leg they put down on the pedal to speed with.
That would make a good example of them, but would lead to a bad system.
  
Same as the intent of the top comment that user "urindanger" made.

And thus the term "Dick Support Level" for bitcoin was born.

I was eleven and learning English, I had to take out a dictionary and eventually I followed it. It really is one of the best parts of the movie in my opinion, makes you think.
I don't remember it well but it was basically about how Neo had to make a choice between following his heart and rebelling against the system (trying to save trinity), or the destruction of the human race.
The matrix could never balance itself out completely and the result of that imbalance in the mathematics is "The One". The idea was that since "The one" was already a well known problem, the architect had already planned for him. 
Yes, a lot of it is bullshit and the speech is really filled with unnecessarily big words but it's a good scene and not that hard to follow. 
I think the vocabulary was chosen in a way to characterize the architect as a strict mathematical AI that likes precision. Thus instead of using simple words like "therefore, or so" he uses fancier  more strictly defined words such as "concordantly" 
concordantly vis a vis ergo apropos

Listen the price of bitcoin in 3 years could be the same price as now, lower or higher.
It may keep pace with inflation, it may not.
 What's more important is that the lightning network keeps getting developed so we can eventually, a few years from now scale bitcoin.
