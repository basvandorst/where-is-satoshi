Bitcoin is *not* supposed to be a moneymaking scheme, however, in reality for some it is. But to me its the ability to "vote" directly with my own money and sent it to whomever, whenever or wherever I want. 
This might be a stretch but hear me out, I see Cryptocurrency as being the gateway to a global economy where there are no borders or regulations and if there are economic hardships in say a third world country those people do not lose their life savings because they are tied to the rest of the world. 
You have christian values, i have no problem with that. I was brought up very christian myself and told that computers/internet/TV's were sinful and the devil's work, now theres a few of each in my parent's home. This shows to me that your values may be outdated and crypto seen to be against your personal/religious values and that's okay. but that doesn't mean it will fail.
Based on your other answers, you have a basic understanding of how stocks work. This is not stocks. The price fluctuates while people are still buying. Is it inflated? Almost definitely. There are kinks to be worked out. If you think the banking system you bank on (no pun intended) is better? Its not
As for your generation, they are not stupid. I connect with you people better than my own, but you? Might be.
However, you have got some balls posting this in r/bitcoin ill give you that hahaha

You're making faster and cheaper seem like a bad thing?

Your initial post actually doesn't mention that once. And I highly doubt that you just so happened to come upon r/btc if you really had that much invested. 
And if you did... then it just further proves my point that you made a stupid mistake and want to throw the blame on someone else.

definitely mad... "lets use 3 different coins because our original is slowly failing at its one job of being a peer to peer currency" 
Listen up, this is how crypto will work. I very much hope that bitcoin does not stay at the top of the ladder without some restructuring. As technology progresses there will be faster, better and more secure coins that come along. Competition is good, it pushes the winning team to stay at the top. If you're really threatened by it, then something is wrong. You've basically already admitted defeat.
Side note: I think calling Bcash "bitcoin" is stupid

Quick start: Don't buy bitcoin (BTC) until the fees are lower or you have large chunks of money to toss up to Tx fees. Look into similar alts: LTC, BCH, ETH, etc.

Was it to another one of your wallets? that way you might be able to use their support to gain access once again

You listen to someone who may have misinformed you, make a mistake on your own, and then blame them for it? Right. 
Half of those people probably have no idea what their talking about, but that doesn't make BCH a shit coin. Everyone wants their coins to succeed and grow. Its **YOUR** mistake, now own it. As far as being a coin, BTC and BCH are pretty comparable in their growth (aside from the tx fees, price, and market cap).
**Just to be clear!** I don't know why the hell Roger Ver wants BCH to be called Bitcoin, so i cant speak for that. But don't spew shit cause you're stupid. Shit happens we all will lose money at some point. Stop being a little bitch about it.

Could you explain? I don't hold either anymore, but I am still curious.
I used to send bitcoin between my friends and that loss of utility is what pushed me away. However I still hold high hopes for crypto as a whole

I can attest to this, I used that link. Less than 3 minutes later I realized I had given them my email password and they logged into my gmail from Moscow...(it prompted me to log into gmail to "verify") which I now realize shouldve been a massive res flag. Now I have added 2FA to my gmail :)

Jaxx was recommended to me. Doesn't have Ripple so I primarily only use the marketplace and cold wallets :/

This makes complete sense. However I am embarrassed to say how long it took me to understand what you said....
yet i thought I'd let you know anyway.
