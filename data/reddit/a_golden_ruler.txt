I'm just looking at all my past post where people took his word and was like "bitcoin is a bubble", "bitcoin is a fraud". Now this guy back pedals, where are all those people who believed him?

Yah, I've seen this recently too and it doesn't make sense. They say it's because of about the market cap or whatever, but it's basically making it impossible to move your money during "high" network traffic. I'm looking to get out of coinbase too. This is BS.

Here's the thing. I use coinstar, and they will give you all your money if you boom it to an Amazon gift card. I don't buy off of amazon anymore, but don't want the 10% hit they charge for "straight" cash, so I see this as an opportunity. I would let coinstar users know this for sure then.

Because I don't need to sell. I get paid in usd which pays my bills and rent. And I'm putting money into crypto as an investment. I'm not a day trader so I'm not looking for high and low selling points for the day. I'm looking at the yearly forecasts.

Actually, no, my price point has been 1800 for the last.... 3 years I want to say. I would just be surprised if it hit $1400 anytime soon. Just like my silver, price point is $25, but it looks like that won't happen... for a long time.

Well, that's just it. A while back I commented on the liquidity of precious metals. Other than Ebay and there are some companies that will send you a box to put your stuff in and send it for cash, but other than that, not so easy to convert. Crypto was a lot easier to move around, but cryptos like bitcoin became more of a store of value during the super rise because no one wanted to use it as a currency. For 2016-2017 my predictions were waaaaay off. I thought when certain things like DT winning, I thought the stocks would tank, and gold and silver would boom, even crypto. I was wrong an all accounts. Stocks boomed. And what surprised me is gold and silver did nothing. It didn't dip when I thought, didn't rise when I thought. Just stayed there and continues this trend. Historically if the usd/stocks are doing well gold and silver don't perform well. When stocks and usd are doing poorly, usually gold/silver go up. I didn't see this behavior at all this time around. I hoovered around the $1350 mark for a while. So now, I'm watching the fed res, they raised the interest rates, let's see what happens.

I own both. And let me tell you, gold didn't perform that well. It was actually flat lined for the last couple of years. I would love to see it break $1400 sometime this year. This goes for silver too... hasn't hit over $18 in a couple of years.
