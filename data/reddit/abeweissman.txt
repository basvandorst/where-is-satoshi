Find what you like on blue nile and then have a local jeweler recreate the ring but better as you'll have some input. I did exactly that and my girl is obsessed with her ring. I also went lab grown (conflict free as per request of my girl) and the rock only cost me about 4 g's for a VVSI 1 carat 'diamond', excellent cut, in E color. Me being able to tweak the design a bit was a huge draw to using a local jeweler. I got a ring that cost me around 6k whereas what she wanted (and if I used a real diamond) would have cost me around 10-11k.

Privacy is the state of being unobserved whereas secrecy is the deliberate act of keeping something hidden. 
You challenged his opinion but instead of challenging his opinion in regards to secrecy, you used the word privacy which in essence rendered your statement irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:21:48
I wish you the best of luck, but I would advise against not getting a ring. You can get a customized ring of high quality for 3k on the bands and whatever you want to spend on a diamond. Lab grown diamonds look better and are cheaper too. You can get a gorgeous ring for under 10k EASY. Girl is gonna want a ring, not bitcoin. 
But that's just my opinion.. You do what you feel. Best of luck!

1) I said willing trade partner. 2) value is a subjective term. You seem to be relating the trade value of a “fucking doubloon” to fiat standards which is kind of weird. If economies around the world broke down, gold would take over. Furthermore the concept of “what one paid for it” previously in fiat dollars would not be relevant as those fiat dollars would have been rendered useless. If those fiat dollars were rendered useless, do you think people would be thinking of the amount of useless tender used to purchase said “fucking doubloons”? I don’t. But hey, you do you my fellow earthling. I’m not looking to argue as you have disqualified yourself from having an adult conversation and I have no desire to play in the mud with you.

Bitcoin is more of a credit union. The one I use is non profit and end of the year, after all expenses/overhead (think transaction fees) are paid, the distribute the remaining money across all members evenly. If you use a bank for your fiat, I recommend looking into a credit union.

I'm in the US so i buy and hold for a minimum of 1 year. I have yet to sell at the absolute top, but I have closed my position 4 times now all within around 20% of ATH's (typically on the come down) I then set aside the money required for my capital gains while I sit and observe the market. In the meantime, I take the rest of my gains along with my original investment and add it to other dividend positions I hold. Once the bottom of BTC is 'found' I start DCA'ing until I am absolutely certain (well to the best of my ability) that we are heading up not down and then I make a few "big buys" till I have the rest of my money I want to invest back in the game. Then I DCA till I rinse and repeat all over again. This time around I started stacking around 3,300 USD and got all the rest of my monies back in around 5,500 USD. It's not a very scientific approach as I don't use TA, but it has been working for me... Everyone's goals, tolerances, and strategies are different.

'Speculative investment'... Mind your p's and q's.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:34:48
The definition is dependent on the time scale used honestly... By literal definition, a bear market is when price falls causing major sell offs. So you can say we have experienced 2 "bear markets" I believe, if you look at '14 (I believe) independent of all other years and '18 (definitely) independent of all other years... But Bitcoin is so young, there isn't enough historical data to reasonably conclude it's cycles coincide with the 365 fiscal year cycles we hold the stock market to. In my humble opinion, applying a 3 year cycle minimum, 5 year maximum seems to be more accurate than cherry picking single years to say bear or bull. Early adopters/long time holders have only experienced a bull market. Those who came in slightly before or at ATH have only seemed to experience a bear market currently starting to rebound. So your entry point and time scale used will determine your perspective of the market. (bear or bull)
All of this is just my opinion of course.
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:13:22
I agree with you. I check price daily, but remain emotionless while doing so. I've allocated an appropriate amount to my holdings and buy when I agree with price using additional funds left over from my various levels of savings. Most people on reddit don't seem to keep a basic ledger. It's a hand to mouth type of scenario for most when deciding what they *can or can't* invest. I'm hoping for everyone that this vehicle can change their lives, but until a basic understanding of true financial independence is attained: Most will return to their current predicament in time.

Reading comprehension in English speaking countries appears to be shit. It’s possible I am judging the majority for work of the minority, but I really believe most people can’t decipher written word anymore....... Can’t decipher or don’t have the patience.. Not sure, but I feel it is one, the other, or both.

How do you figure? For starters, we are only 1.5/4 through 2019 so we can’t draw conclusions from its current, depicted candle compared against the depiction of full year candles year ‘17 and ‘18... In other words, we won’t know if years ‘17,’18, and ’19, when viewed as a set, is or is not a three year downtrend until 1-1-2020 at the absolute earliest. 
 Year ‘17 opens at $966.34 and closes at $13,863.10..... I would call that a big up.
Year ‘18 opens at $13,863.10 and closes at $3,691.86..... Obviously a down, but the fall did not go below previous year’s open and it still was 3x that of the previous year’s open.
2019 is gonna be very telling if we are currently in a 3 year uptrend or not. If price goes sideways for the rest of the year, still an up trend. If it falls back to year’s open, or even goes below it then we can start discussing if we are trending downwards or if we really are in a bear market, something bitcoin has not truly experienced.

@_date: 2019-06-01 04:24:51
Why? It's been accepted as a valuable asset for over 5,000 years. Even if the world and nations were going to transition into a new fiat, in an "apocalyptic" scenario as you termed it, something would need to at least fill the gap. Bartering would obviously be used as well, but there would need to be something else for larger trades than something simple such as "I'll give you this rake and accept your toaster." Other assets and commodities would also hold significant value as well, but then we would have to discuss storage issues. Gold is easy, relatively light-weight, and recognizable. There are issues of course, but let's not get lost in the minutiae of that and stay on task.
As for "jumping to apocalyptic scenarios just to try and make my ducats seem useful", why else would I have a portion of my personal wealth tied into something such as gold? I'm certainly not alone on this subject. If I held all my wealth in gold, I would agree that to be foolish, but I do not. For me, I find that I can rest a little easier at night knowing that I have one of many possible scenarios covered by owning some gold. I have soft assets, I own property, and I have a small business to boot. I am not unfathomably wealthy, but I do alright for myself. My biggest concern isn't acquiring new monies, it's protecting what I currently have. 
This conversation is revolving around gold so I am using examples of scenarios where my gold will, in my opinion, as well as many others, be of good use to me. If that is something you disagree with that is totally cool, but I'm not going to back down from my position just to satisfy your desire to be right about something that you don't even seem to really care about. I'm totally fine having a civil conversation/discussion, and would love to hear something constructive from you if that is possible. I'll even tee it up for you... What would you think about if in my position? What would your fears be if (and maybe they already are) all your basic needs were accounted for? Do you have kids? I genuinely would like to know where you stand if you care to share. However, if you just want to keep trying to poke holes in the legitimacy of my plan to action with very little substance, I'll gladly let you dissipate into the atmosphere of the reddit universe. Ball in in your court sir.

@_date: 2019-06-01 00:24:51
Honestly, gold is not an investment. It’s a store of value/hedge. I hold gold and bitcoin. Bitcoin is the better “investment” 100% but to answer your question of “what has gold done in the last 5 years?” It has held its value, just like it has for over 5,000 years... if someone tells you gold is an investment, I would ask them to define investment. But to suggest gold is worthless or something to that effect is silly. Again I hold gold, but not as an investment. I hold gold to “freeze” a portion of my wealth until a later time. The more my gold increases in paper value does not mean my gold value has been growing. It means that fiat value is inflating/being diluted. I hope that clears it up a little as to why some of us (maybe most of us?) hold some gold in our diversified portfolios.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:51:30
That's a very good point. The time parameters I used were what the other poster used "3 year cycle". By webster's definition you can easily call '18 a bear market when looking at it by itself, but that's not how I was looking at it. When looking at it as the set of 3 years ('17, '18, and '19 or '16,'17, and '18, etc..) I believe it is more difficult to single out a bear market. Those who long and those who trade in the here and now will define bear and bull markets differently is what I'm getting at. He used a three year cycle so that's what I ran with and how I arrived at my claim of BTC not experiencing a bear market. Crypto is way different than stock market, I completely agree. As I stated in my post above, I believe 1/1/2020 will provide more clarity as to what sort of trend we are in. This is all familiar, yet uncharted territory.

No it doesn’t. It means you ended or *closed* a position in the black.

Either way, when you decide to close a position, whatever happens after is irrelevant as you are no longer in the game.

I am open minded. I would read your research paper if you provided it, because I love to read, but I did my own research and found essays which supported my own thoughts on the matter. I doubt one paper provided by you will make a difference, but I AM open to read it. You have still failed to provide it however so.... 
If I had to pin anyone with being close-minded, my good sir, I would put that on you as this one research paper seems to be all that you need to form your conclusion.
In regard to your claim, I believe what you were speaking to was more so about how individuals learn, whereas my claim was simply that "reading" was the best workout for one's mind. I made no claims about learning or reading being greater than ______ in the form of learning.. I simply stated that it is **the best workout for your mind, hands down. Always has been, always will be.** You must have glossed over that while forming your argument prematurely. But of course, that is just my opinion.

Not necessarily. There is a number of reasons an individual may purchase gold with Bitcoin. Personally I wouldn’t at this time, but maybe years down the road if bitcoin takes over the world economy and I could get some gold for minimal sats maybe I would. I think it’s very cool that it’s at least an option. I do not stack gold as an investment, just as a store of value/crisis hedge. I’m no pro trader, but I feel adequately diversified and have my hands in a broad range of assets. Some for growth, some for stability, some for long shots, etc. I’m not very materialistic, but I need to do something with my worth as I believe leaving in it a for profit bank is a bad decision. That’s just me though.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:15:00
I will not call it a “draw”. I will say in regard to learning, your claim sounds reasonable and maybe it is factual, but I was not speaking to that matter at all. 
Either way, I have enjoyed the conversation. Just don’t jump to calling someone closed minded for expressing their opinion prior to reading a document not produced lol. Yes, I could have refrained from saying I probably would have found it subjective, but that is a far cry from expressing a closed mind.

True, but confiscating all the gold being held in the private sector would be a daunting task. Nay, impossible. Depending on how it was purchased, ‘some’ gold could be confiscated easily if it ever came to that, but for that to go down would be more so related to illegal activity then simply a whim to confiscate privately held gold. You are correct though.

I don't need to go there and do such because 1) I am not confused as to what the temperature of the market is and 2) what other people have to say about what they think this market, that no one truly knows what is going to happen, is going to do. Call it a bear, that's cool. Call it a bull, that's cool too. If I see a future in it, I don't pay attention to the ebbs and flows. Day trading I would, but I don't day trade so it means very little to me.  
Your definition of a bear market is appropriate for short term traders, but the idea of bear and bull markets are highly subjective and dependent on who you ask. The terms are not concrete. It's not like God came down and said "this is a bear market, this is a bull market". They are just terms created and accepted by humans in an effort to define trends. Bull markets can become bear markets over night and bear markets can become bull markets in a flash as well. 
Last comment, early adopters and long term holders, depending on the time scale they use, have not experienced a bear market. Unless you key in on a single year that is. Those who are long wont do that though which is where you get all these voices who claim there hasn't been a bear market. They call them consolidations or corrections and the like.
The bear markets I see are '14 and '18 with both ending in the next year. I can absolutely understand an argument for them not being bear markets though. Matter of perspective really.

If you’re so right then prove it. Show me where I told people they should sell...  not a difficult thing to do... we both know you can’t, you just don’t want to admit it.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:37:53
"Hodl long enough you win" exactly. So presently, if someone bought in at ATH they would be *losing* but would not have incurred a *loss* unless they were to sell. Maybe it never gets back up there and eventually it becomes a *loss*, once realized through sale or dissolution of BTC, but at the current moment that is not the case. Semantics.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:05:04
Words meant to simplify, yet only add to the confusion as people compare their own perspectives which tend to be different. Apples and oranges. We can apply these terms "bull, bear, correction, recession, expansion", but only if we are to use the same parameters while discussing. I'm with you though. It's all semantics end of the day.

I agree with you. Again, I was working with the time parameters set by the original poster: 3 years. Using the 'halvenings' as the metric is a much better way of going about it. Doing it that way would be using a 4ish year metric.. The only problem with that, which will be solved as more time passes, is that we don't have enough data to really analyze what's happening/happened. 
As for what the original comment I was replying to asked, I do not believe we are trending down based off the last three years. I believe we are trending up, but we truly will not know until 1/1/20 at the absolute earliest. Just my opinion of course.

Technically he’s right though. Regardless of where one might have bought, until you sell or If BTC were to “disappear”, being down is not a loss until it is realized through selling. I believe that is his point.

1) Nobody really knows what’s going to happen. So your own research and you will come to this conclusion. 
2) If you are looking for potential of short term (figure around a month from now) right now might be a good time to buy, but maybe next couple days would be better... how much better? For lower dollar amounts, you’re not talking much. 
3) If you lookin for long term (hold for at least 1 year) now is a decent time to buy.. Price looks like it wants to pass 9,000 but presently there seems to be some resistance. I added another $400 worth the other day around 8,100 price on the pullback from 9k...
4) Conclusion.. Nobody knows what’s gonna happen. Lower dollar amounts you better off just purchasing at a consistent rate.. once a week, regardless of price. 
Lower dollar amounts, the best thing you can do is acquire. Trying to time the market will make very little difference to you. Larger dollar amounts is when it really starts to make a difference for entry and exit. 10 dollars really isn’t much, but is very sensible. Do it consistently and don’t even pay attention to the price. It’s a long road, but could be worth it.
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:02:33
Not necessarily. Most are under the impression they are just immediately liquidating it into fiat, but that’s a non issue. Even if they are, the BTC finds its way back to the market which is a form of circulation.

I’ve bought a set of golf clubs  for 2 - 1/10 troy gold coins before... does that count? I got a deal on face value at the time, and my buddy got a deal due to inflation years later... this was years ago, but that still counts right??
To add, my buddy still laughs at me to this day saying I overpaid because his coin value went up... I constantly remind him that his gold is still worth the same as it was when I traded for him, but he doesn’t get it... he still has the coins as far as I know. He’s a dummy, but I love him for it.

@_date: 2019-06-12 14:34:18
I consider 1/10 to be about 800 at this current time. It’s not a ton of money, no, but if bitcoin went to 60,000 you 1/10 would be worth about 6k... all numbers are usd. 6k ain’t a ton of money either but it is waaaaay more than 0, that’s for sure..
So what do I think of 1/10? I think good for you man. Keep stacking with spare money if you desire, but there are other things you can do with your currency besides and before crypto. Make an emergency fund. That should be step 1.
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:06:48
If you have little to no experience I wouldn’t recommend “trading” at all... what you need right now my friend is growth.. Stock market is unreliable at this time, you can always make money, but you gotta do a LOT of research or else all you’re doing is guessing. What you do with your money is your business so I’m not gonna steer you into any direction other than finding something safe with upside... maybe it’s getting a couple ETF’s ala warren buffet style or maybe you just want to gamble some high risk, high reward type vehicle. Bitcoin is a high risk, high reward vehicle. What ever you invest in Bitcoin could be worth nothing one day... Maybe it ends up being worth a lot.. that’s up to you to decide. 
Rule # 1 though... don’t invest in something someone else tells you to.. end of the day, you only want to be able to blame yourself for a bad investment. That’s the big thing I live by.
Hope that helps, good luck to you.
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:50:27
Not true. Before bitcoin people wouldn’t call today a bear market and tomorrow a bull and Tuesday a bear again.. Mainly because markets outside of crypto don’t move like this. 
And what do you mean “sustained” doesn’t mean anything? That is hilarious you would even suggest that because if you apply that same logic to every word in language then all meaning is lost and nothing means anything.
Google the definition of sustained. Bear and bulls are terms used to talk about the long term trend of an asset. You if it’s bear then most would agree the asset is trending down for the foreseeable future. If it’s bull it’s the opposite.
Whatever you are trying to say needs to be rethought and resubmitted because currently it makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:49:17
Sustained price movement in a particular direction. Up for bull, down for bear... 
Your definition of higher highs and lower lows is a bi product of bear and bull markets but that’s not how they’re defined.
An asset could be down 99% from previous year but currently in a two month bull cycle up 10% from start of the year...
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:00:33
I was pretty clear from the start that I was not contesting your thoughts \*about\* the content, but rather how you decided to hold a position in criticism of something you didn't actually watch. As an observer of your exchange with the OP, I thought you sounded silly. If you refined your position, you could have made a much better argument as there was plenty to contest in that video... Though you wouldn't know.. You didn't watch it. To me, and maybe only me, you came off as very immature. Had you watched the video and held the same position, I would have probably thought differently. But again, you didn't watch it yet you made a claim as if you did while stating that you didn't. So yea, I'm digging at you.

I don’t believe it’s as large of a threat as you and others make it out to be. For instance, if the government decides it won’t accept your bitcoin and demands to be paid in fiat, guess what you’re gonna pay them in.... That’s right, fiat. 
There is really nothing magical about bitcoin. It’s just a digital ledger. A very secure digital ledger, yes, but that’s all it is.
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:05:21
I’m not gonna lie to you and say I understand why the price of bitcoin moves around but I can give a layman’s explanation... 
There seems to be three main contributors that I believe have an impact on price.... 1) supply and demand 2) sentiment (are people bullish or bearish) and 3) manipulation.
1)There is a limited supply and as more people enter the space it becomes more and more difficult to get your hands on it. When more people are trying to get some, price goes up... think of it like a bidding war in a way... when less people want bitcoin the price goes down because people are trying to entice buyers who weren’t buying at a higher price.... this goes back and fourth and is quite normal in any “market” where people buy and sell stuff.
2) sentiment: if people are feeling real bullish on bitcoin, you may start to hear about it all around you. People are talking and it’s all the positives about bitcoin. Some things aren’t even true but are said simply to get people to buy more of it.. example: all the stories you hear about people becoming millionaires and buying lambos.... that’s the hook used to bring people in.. when people are very bearish on bitcoin sentiment drops and people are less inclined to buy because everything they are hearing about bitcoin is all the problems/issues etc.... What’s interesting about bitcoin specifically is all the (and I’m assuming they are paid) shills (people who try to convince others to buy bitcoin. There is a huge war over the common persons mind kind of like how any other product is marketed and advertised.... There are people that want you to buy bitcoin and then there are people who want you to buy other coins blah blah blah..
3) and then finally the last point, manipulation. Believe it or not, totally up to you, but I believe pretty strongly that the price of bitcoin is manipulated to look better (or some instances worse) then it currently is.. Wether that’s exchanges suppressing buy orders to keep prices low or suppressing sell orders to keep prices high, there is something unnatural about this space....
But I guarantee you someone feels differently then I do.. I’m only offering you my opinion which is generally pretty black and white... I have maid investments and cashed out profitably with bitcoin, but I’m not gonna tell you it is fool proof.. I know people who have lost money too.. it’s really just a game till it’s not anymore and who knows when that will end. All I know is that one day there won’t be “bitcoin” in the way it’s described now... to me I believe governments will eventually jump in the space with their own “coin” and eventually everything will be exactly like it was before bitcoin.
Money is power and control. “They” have the power and “They” have the control. Bitcoin will not free anyone from anything. -just my two cents.

I should add.... In regard to TA, I DO look at charts but I don't scribble the silly lines or look to deeply into the patterns like some people do.. I mean, to each their own and all that, but using TA with crypto is a crapshoot in my opinion. With lack of regulations and if price manipulation runs as wild as some people say it does, then why would someone try to apply "the book" to crypto? If people are manipulating price, they know what and where investors are going to buy or sell at.. Just my 2 sats.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:32:01
Aren’t smart why? Because they are choosing not to partake in a ponzi and are keeping their money in traditional investment vehicles?

I consistently acquire gold between 20 and 30 dollars over spot. I do not expect anyone to sell me gold at a loss. I want people to make a profit, I really do. I just don't want to be taken advantage of as I'm sure you don't want to be either. $20-$30 over spot per troy when purchasing weight is not unreasonable. The check/wire price listed isn't bad, but the BTC price is too high in my opinion...

My advice, and please take it with a grain of salt, is to not place trigger orders (unless they are buys) during your waking hours. If while you go to sleep you fear there will be a big pull back or something so you want to place a stop loss or whatever, fine, but cancel it the moment you wake up. When you are awake, monitor it and act accordingly. 
again, just my two cents. Best of luck

Something very cool to note is that gold can always be melted down and recast... They sell all of the necessities if this is something you wanted to learn and perform yourself too. :) I have been in the works of designing my own coining die so I can cast a few coins with my face on them just for the shits and giggles of it haha. I wouldn't melt down all of my gold but just enough to make a few 1oz coins to give to my kids so they can always have a likeness of me in case something were to happen that stored some value. Obviously they would inherit much more than just a coin, but the goal is that it can last for many generations.. Just something fun for me to do in my spare time. HAVE FUN!

Yea because that’s what I want to be: edgy. Fuck no. Call them what they are. Debt notes which are loaned to governments at interest. Essentially, they are a debt that can never be paid back in full using the currency that was lent out. And when I say paid back in full, I’m saying the debts assumed by governments, in the grand scheme, can neve be paid back in full because there isn’t enough debt notes in circulation. That is unless they print out more currency and lend that to the governments... oh wait.. it’s lent out with interest... yep, can never be paid back in full unless interest is paid using another commodity such as..... wait for it....... keep waiting...

To time it is near to practically impossible as there are a lot of “head fakes”, but I as well many others (maybe you too) KNEW it was coming sooner or later.. I salute you for trying to time it, more balls than me... I take profits when I feel satisfied with my returns. There’s always a chance of not being able to re enter profitably and that’s when I pack my things and wait for the next bull run. Best of luck my fellow trader.

Honestly, and I say this with respect, if your plan is to inform people of something you see happening but don’t want to give a reason why then you are really doing 1 of 2 things in my opinion.. you’re either 1) right and are trying to save others from a dip because you truly care about other people (just not enough to inform them of the reason WHY there will be a big dip) or 2) you’re attempting to shake weak hands and influence a pull back so you can possibly increase your own stake at a better rate...
I’m leaning towards  personally, but who knows... what I do know though is that if I was to sell now I would create a taxable event as I live in US and the money I end up paying in tax would offset the usefulness of avoiding a pull back from its current price..
You were clear that this info doesn’t pertain to people long on Bitcoin, so there’s that, but maybe you can clear something up..... 
What do you stand to gain by helping day traders avoiding a pullback?

Did I advocate it? Pretty sure, no, absolutely positive that I did not.. Based off your response, I’m pretty sure you didn’t even know what the word advocate meant before you googled my use of it and put it in your own response..
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:28:40
It goes in and out of style.
@_date: 2019-05-28 04:45:55
I feel you.. Here’s my advice. Everyone is on bullshit, trust no one. Do what is right for you and your family.. Maybe a couple close friends but that’s it. Realize that most of the world will take from you if you give them the chance. Don’t give them the opportunity. 
That’s it. If you need it broken down more than that you’re probably already fucked. Best to you lad.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:27:19
Yea ok... Only speaking for myself here, but I don’t care to actually control “real bitcoin”.. I just want the profit. I’m sure I’m not alone.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:08:25
He asked a simple question... Your response was not only unhelpful, but also stupid in it’s own right.. 
Take a look around.. You’re the troll.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:25:59
I think you are right, but either way that's circulation baby. One small step, one giant leap type shit. :)
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:58:47
Oh definitely, but the cost of mining such gold isn't cheap. I could be wrong, but I wouldn't expect an influx of space gold to cause the value of gold to drop..... Man do I want some space gold though... mmmmmm
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:09:55
I haven't looked in to the matter, just noticed they accepted BTC. I will continue to use check/wire, but am now curious as to the implications of using BTC. You bring up some good thoughts. I haven't thought of it that way.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:23:00
No, visa/card costs more. It costs more than check/wire which is how I choose to purchase my gold/silver.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:48:05
What difference does that make?
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:52:02
Everyone wants it to go up. Some want it to go down first (so they can stack) and then go back up. Government wants it to fail. As for what the price is going to do, no one knows. Asking for investment advice, especially on the internet, would suggest a person doesn't have a clue and should probably do some research and then make their own determination. 
Best of luck to you.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:27:29
Which would explain the slightly higher fee for bullion vs check/wire. So in reality, they are probably offering the same treatment for bitcoin as check/wire, just additional process fees, ceteris paribus.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:40:28
bankers and the judge.... Ouch Bezos..

Edit: I misread your comment and responded poorly. My mistake. I didn't down vote you, but please accept my upvote.
I understand your view and what you choose to do with YOUR money is your prerogative. As for sitting on my ass on the couch? Sir, you haven't the slightest clue what I do or how I conduct my business so please do not make claims as if you do. $50 over spot on 9 troy equals $450 dollars. Still a pittance, but foolish IN MY OPINION. I have no doubts about my worth and in large that has to do with HOW I CHOOSE TO MANAGE IT. Most who are successful would disagree with your opinion, but you're right, to each their own. Best of luck to you.

If someone is simply looking at it as a speculative investment vehicle than what would be the issue of using robinhood? Who needs to “hold” it if you intention is just to flip it? And as for other investors, we should be urging people to purchase while leaving the details of “how” they should invest up to them and their own research.. You want to turn a new, potential investor off to crypto quickly? Talk shop with them. 99% of people will be lost after your first couple words.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:58:14
cheaper to buy 1 oz at a time, yes. Occasionally I go around online and look for good deals if there are any, but most of my purchases come through a local vendor who I have developed a relationship with over the years. 
Coins are cool it that's the type of gold/silver investor you want to be. Everyone is gonna be a little different. Personally I like to acquire weight and try to do so at the best prices available. Numismatic value means very little to me unless I was to inherit old coins or something like that. As for my purchases I only care about weight and purity. Again, every gold purchaser is gonna have their own way of going about things. 
As for resources, google and youtube would be a good place to start immediately. Go to the library and look for books on the subject also. Getting yourself involved with others who like the stuff is another good way to immerse yourself as well... You're gonna always make mistakes from time to time, I do as well. Don't be to worried about that as long as you are not repeating the same mistakes. Alot of people like to DCA with their purchases and others like to make bulk purchases whenever they get big chunks of cash and want to do something with it... The only real thing you can do wrong in my opinion is getting anxious and paying to much or dealing with shady characters.. Take it slow, even when you get more comfortable.. The price doesn't fluctuate wildly.. I wouldn't even call gold an investment to be honest.. It's pretty much just a store of value to help hedge against inflation and such. Just like how you should only invest in bitcoin what you are willing to lose forever, only invest in gold with what you are willing to part with for a long long time. If something crazy ever happens, having gold is a big comfort to me and my family/kids... But again, everyone is different and has different values. Best of luck! Enjoy the rabbit hole!
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:47:37
Yes. Very good.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:15:33
Agreed. But if others want to be early adopters, I'm all for it as it only helps the legitimacy of the currency. We want this coin to spread to the masses in pretty much anyway possible in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:06:25
Tax fraud how? Personally, I am not purchasing gold with BTC and have no plans of doing it so I haven't looked in to the matter. I am genuinely curious though as to what you mean.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:17:42
Good point. AbeWeissman is one of 3 accounts I keep on reddit. I would rather I kept all accounts separate, and a post like this I chose not to tie into my main account. To answer your question, yes I help with some people if I can, but I also don’t go around parading as if I know everything so most of the time I keep my mouth shut if I don’t hold a definitive answer.. 
Am I complaining? I don’t feel as if I am. More so I am bringing attention to the way others interact on here. End of the day I’m secure in my feelings, but wanted to say something on behalf of the newbies is all. If nothing changes at least I said something is how I feel.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:07:33
I appreciate the thoughtful response. There’s been a pullback as everyone is aware. Coincidence or maybe you’ve keyed in on something... Either way, I’ve reconsidered my feeling towards your post and have mentally upgraded you to that of “possibly trustworthy, definitely worth a follow”. :) 
Again, thank you for the thoughtful response.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:52:53
Beautifully done.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:34:39
I reread it. You are correct, my mistake.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:20:27
Do newbies read the “rules” though? I doubt it.. if someone asks a dumb question or breaks a “rule” let the mods deal with it is my point. 
Being friendly is so freaking easy. That’s all.

The cost of shooting ships out in space, targeting and landing on asteroids, bringing equipment/mobilizing, paying 'remote' operators to man said equipment, the process of mining asteroids, packaging gold and preparing for shipment back to earth, unloading mined gold, moving said gold to wherever it is to be stored, etc etc etc... leads me to believe the value of gold will stay intact... I could be wrong, but I don't believe it's as simple as "hey let's go get some easy gold from that asteroid flying around space at xxxx mph."
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:18:36
I believe every state is a little different, but unsure.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:21:38
Ah, yes, of course. I'm sorry, I did not follow you at first but you are absolutely correct.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:22:31
Fair enough, but why even waste your time? Either let them figure it out or someone who wants to invest the time give a thoughtful answer. “Do you even money bro” is funny, I’ll give you that, but it doesn’t add to the conversation in a productive way. Just my opinion of course.
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:40:48
Both of the stocks you mentioned, Apple and Nvidia, are dividend stocks that do pay interest. Is it “guaranteed”? No, but generally you would be notified in advance if they were gonna lower it or cut it. A lot of mature dividend stocks like to raise their payout every year to keep investors happy yada yada....
I get what you’re saying and second your call for him to show caution, but I disagree with the idea of him being “greedy”. If anything, he is being savvy as there are a multitude of dividend stocks out there that many, many people utilize for growth as well as steady income streams into retirement. He is simply asking a good question that doesn’t yet have a good solution. Maybe one day it will... Maybe he’s the guy to start it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:32:33
Right. Have a good day sir or madam.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:50:15
On bitcoin no, but I wasn't hurt any.. Across all of my holdings (which aren't crypto) yes, yes I did. :)
@_date: 2019-05-31 23:15:44
I will take 1 liter of your finest cola
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:47:30
Totally agree with you.
In (*) an ideal world, yes we would have both, and in my real world dealings I typically do... Reddit can be a dank dark place at times though.. Why? I wish I knew.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:33:02
I’ll give it to you like this... I either got in the game way before you or I spent way more debt notes acquiring what amount I may or may not currently have. As for being a piker? I’ve never left a commitment unfulfilled and I LOVE to gamble. &lt;3
