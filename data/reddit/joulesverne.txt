No periods or other special characters? Damn, there go my ideas for Default.aspx and index.html

wtf? I just tried logging in after months of inactivity and it's asking me for a Google Authenticator code.
But I never enabled 2-factor. (because the probability of me losing my phone is greater than the probability of me getting malware, and I wasn't going to use CampBX for large amounts anyway)
UPDATE: I'm able to log in now after a support ticket to remove the 2-factor. The 0.0 BTC and $0 that I had in there are still intact.

blockchain.info isn't like normal sites; almost everything's done client-side in javascript, including encryption/decryption.
What could have happened is someone guessed your username, which will allow them to download your encrypted wallet (**unless you have email 2FA enabled**, which adds another step before the encrypted data can be downloaded).
Once someone has an encrypted file, bruteforcing a password as small as 10 characters is easy.

Oh, so sidechain data would be included with the main blockchain data? 
That makes me worried about unwanted sidechain bloat being pushed to the hard drives of normal nodes. Maybe percentage-wise it wouldn't be so bad though. And certainly fees would mitigate it. But all the limitations make it sound like altcoins will probably continue to thrive outside of BTC.

I'm still not clear on how BTC would get restored on the main chain. What information could bitcoin access that proves that sidechaincoins were burned (or whatever the sidechain-based redemption condition is)? Would it mean that the main blockchain would become dependent on oracle servers?
