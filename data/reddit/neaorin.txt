i didnt say it was simple. I tried my best to give a basic explanation. There's complex risk modeling involved and hefty paychecks for people in the financial industry who can do that sort of thing.

maybe not lending in the traditional banking sense. But they have a bank account at Barclays. So they could theoretically deposit the fiat from my buy btc order, NOT buy any actual btc and earn interest on the fiat sum.
They would likely only do this in a bear market where holding fiat is advantageous. In a bull market they would convert to btc.
I'm not even sure this necessarily makes them insolvent. Yes if a run happened they wouldn't have enough btc to cover everyone but they hold the fiat which they could use to buy in a pinch. It would just take a while and probably push the price up. In FRB that fiat was loaned out by the bank.

like i said during a crypto bull market there's more incentive for them to hold crypto rather than fiat so they would be fine.
but lets say there was a run sometime in 2018. and maybe their crypto / fiat threshold they felt comfortable with was 70 / 30. but also not all of their customers participated in the run, only 90 percent of crypto deposits were claimed.
then they would need to buy the 20 percent of missing crypto with the fiat, the interest they earned on it, and if that was not enough their own pockets and by borrowing from Barclays. so if there were a run they would lose X amount of money.
but you balance that against the estimated chance of actually being a run (pretty low) and the amount you stand to gain. they prolly sold a ton of btc at $10k+ at the beginning of the year and they'd be buying back part of that at lower prices even during a run. 
all that stuff is risk management...

fair enough, let's live all our lives in fear of the black swan and never get inside an airplane, a school (we might get shot), never found a startup, in fact never do anything at all. 
i know it might seem strange to some people but to entrepreneurs, losing everything they own is not the ultimate catastrophe. if it were they wouldn't be entrepreneurs in the first place. in fact most entrepreneurs fail multiple times before they make it. this risk was always unquantifiable and always will be but they went at it anyway.

it's called foreign exchange risk management. banks do it. there is a moving threshold for fiat / crypto holdings ratio where coinbase might feel the risk is manageable. especially in bear markets or if they have also have secured a line of credit from Barclays to draw from in a pinch. Or they may feel its too risky to even attempt. We have no idea really.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:33:43
my assumption is that they have extra cash sources on hand, besides the fiat sent to them by customers. Previous profits. Any interest they earned on their fiat deposits. Access to credit from the bank. Money from their investors.
They'd probably lose money if a run happened, but they wouldn't necessarily go bust. Depends on many factors.

I mean eventually aren't we all trying to send and receive funds on LN? We gotta move past the "send some btc we bought with fiat to a merchant that's gonna convert it to fiat" stage for real adoption, and we'd also be getting cashback from loyalty programs etc in addition to getting paid through LN. Same with that merchant , we don't want them turning their btc into fiat, but paying their people instead.

I assume they require KYC because they need to know that it's *your* bank account you want to transfer some fiat to after selling crypto. 
Any exchange out there who will allow you to only buy via PayPal, and not allow you to sell to fiat while also not requiring KYC?

Thanks - "eventual security" is a nice succinct way of describing it, although I don't think I would use that to explain it to my parents LOL
But you still need to keep an eye on your channel counterpart, assuming you don't already choose to trust them by default (i.e. they are not a paypal-type service that has built trust with many people in time).
Maybe software can do this monitoring automatically (assuming you're online) without the need to run a full node?
Otherwise in practice the users will take the path of least resistance, which will be to trust some authority that others also seem to trust. Just look at how many people have their money stored by coinbase.

NVIDIA stock went up 1000% in two years and a half. 
Or about 550% in three years if you HODL'd through the tail end of the bubble (oct-dec '18). 
And NVIDIA was a Fortune 500 company and had steady revenue streams _before_ the crypto bump. Way less risky as an investment, and prolly gonna climb back up steadily on the back of growing AI workloads.
MSFT and AMZN are also right around 100% over the last three years, not counting dividends (for MSFT anyway). Again, these are Fortune 500 companies so it's not like there was a chance of either of them going bust.

For whatever reason I don't think NVIDIA ever wanted to be associated with cryptocurrencies. 
Their big bet is on AI. Go take a look  at their front page, it's 70 percent AI. It's been like that for a while now.
In fact [a google search on "cryptocurrency"]( on their domain only returns links to dev forums and references to external articles

personally I missed both the initial 2016 bull run (started accumulating NVIDIA at around $95 at the end of 2016 and kept going until mid 2017) and the bubble popping this october (sold it all at $211 a month after falling all the way from $286). Including dividends I'm close to 100% for the past two years.
I bought them as an AI play because GPU based deep learning was beginning to take off and nvidia were dominating that shit (and still are). I wasn't very interested in cryptocurrency at the time so I didn't really see that angle but for crypto geeks I guess it's not unrealistic they might have picked up on the opportunity. Looking back it seems that the bull run was fueled by crypto a little more than AI.
You're right that 1000% was unrealistic unless you got very lucky but 200-400% was possible on NVIDIA. anyway the OP simply asked if there was a better investment than their 100% in three years on btc. They were out there... and NVIDIA in particular is something crypto fans might have run across. It's not like they were some obscure startup which had nothing to do with crypto.

Technically, "fractional reserve" means just that - they don't have enough coin (in this case, crypto) in reserve in their vault to cover all deposits. The fact that banks end up with a fractional reserve through lending is more of an implementation detail. Anything that coinbase holds in lieu of crypto (like fiat) carries risk because of the fluctuating exchange rate.

Another bubble can absolutely happen without adoption. But IMO the last bubble was the only one so far that actively *hurt* adoption.
We've lost important players in the online retail space like Stripe because the bubble finally revealed to many online merchants - and through them, to online payment processors like Stripe - that Bitcoin *wasn't ready for mass adoption*. It couldn't scale on-chain, and off-chain scaling solutions were not ready (I'd argue that's still the case because LN is still beta and not easy to use for non-geeks).
Maybe the volatility risk was a thing some of the larger retailers could have tolerated (even if only by immediately converting to fiat for a while) but the insane fees and confirmation times meant that any perceived advantages to traditional payment channels were negated.
[Stripe's blog post]( makes all this painfully obvious...
Yes, fees and confirmation times have since returned to "normal" but that's mostly because transaction levels have also returned to normal and the network is no longer operating anywhere close to capacity.  And yes that capacity has also increased a little bit.
So if you want to see BTC get real traction, you should hope that the next bull run only happens when LN is ready for mainstream use. Maybe 4-6 months? Maybe a year? I don't know. But that's what I'm hoping for.

Security, Scalability, Decentralization: choose two.
I think that while Core favors Security and Decentralization, LN seems to be all in on Scalability. But it's not clear for me how LN participants will manage the Security - Decentralization trade-off in practice. 
You're basically depositing your coin into a multi-signature address which at the very least requires active monitoring on your part, so you can detect whether your counterpart has gone evil and tried to broadcast an incorrect state of the channel to the blockchain.
In practice, what I fear will happen is that people will simply either delegate this monitoring activity to an authority they trust, or only open channels to other "trusted" nodes in the first place. Those "trusted" nodes or authorities will become a form of centralization, ala Paypal.

The Chinese government would likely decide to take control of the network a long time before the US might.
It wouldnt even take all that much effort. They would simply make the Chinese miners "an offer they couldn't refuse" and take over their operations.
