Ehh.... You can get different versions of the 580 (the one from MSI here has 8gb VRAM, found it at Amazon and another place that probably only ships in my country) for 450-470.

15$ transaction fee, not the kind of currency I wanna use tbh.

And what would you want for that? Cause I can't pay you interest for it. The Bitcoins I would owe you would increase in value over the time I'm in your debt. Paying interest on top of paying back more Bitcoins than you gave me (well, not more in that sense, but by now Bitcoins will be more expensive and harder for me to get) is pretty hard for anyone who's not, well, printing ~~money~~ bitcoins. So either I don't pay interest in which case I only have to worry about bitcoins becoming more expensive, or I don't take any debts at all. Considering you have no reason to loan me Bitcoins if there's nothing for you to gain from it we would be in a system that's solely build around credit givers and credit takers paying back/asking for their money at the "right" time.
Like when there's a huge inflation and people are happy that the debts they used to build a house are now worth as much as a bread. That's what I would have to hope for, "Bitcoin better drop by 40% by the time he wants his money back, if it gained another 30% (/thread) I can go into insolvency instead.
And I dunno if that's 


the term you're looking for.

A currency that's based on deflation instead of inflation will never be able to be a real currency. You can invest in it yeah, but having a currency that discourages you (and banks, investors, companies, countires) to take debts won't bring us very far.

That's a scam, my friend.

So that you can take debts and, wow, suprise, you're also capable of repaying them. Without inflation no one will take debts, which kills the entire economy, it even kills the finances of every single country, state, city and commune. Why would any company invest into anything? You take debts, you'll have to pay intrest for that, and on top of that your debts will grow each year by a ridiculous amount. People wouldn't be able to afford building houses, taking credits for studying etc.

Why would you exchange a currency that's only rising in value? Even aside from the fact that taking debts becomes impossible, why buy something if you can just wait another year to buy the thing twice? 
No one wants to exchange bitcoin, aside from people who *really* got no other choice to get access to their online drugs or something. Like seriously, you gotta be hella stupid to trade bitcoins for money, wares or just the interest the bank wants from you for the money they gave you. 
Edit: Inflation exists to encourage you to get rid of your money, to not just save it. The economy needs that.

No.. You cannot take debts with bitcoin as a currency. There's no inflation in bitcoin, it's not meant to be a currency, it's meant to be something you speculate and invest into.
