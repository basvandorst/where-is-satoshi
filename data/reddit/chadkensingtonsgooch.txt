No I'm saying blocks should be bigger since we've obviously hit the size limit and it's making fees insane.

It was way more than that!


Not true depending on how they were transferred to you. I recently paid $946 for two bitcoin transactions. I paid ~500 sat/byte which was the going rate at the time. Tons of inputs.

how much is blockstream paying you to shill on here?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:24:34
don't worry $40 transaction fees will come back

I know I'm not exaggerating. That's what bitcoin tx fees are like when you receive many smaller inputs to your wallet such as mining revenue. I'm not spending time to find a tx id for what you can easily calculate yourself to be true. Think several 0.01 transactions totalling 1 bitcoin. Then send that somewhere at over 500 satoshi per byte.

your source on this being "fake news?" This is being widely reported.

how so? True conservatives favor marijuana legalization. It was legal long before it wasn't. Conservatives also generally support state's rights.

Shill lies on front page
Average fees are still $30 and literally nobody supports the lightning network.

we're experiencing a lull in bitcoin transactions likely due to the price drop and the shills are celebrating this as a victory for bitcoin because transaction fees are starting to **approach** reasonable levels

It's literally looking at how much bitcoin as a whole is worth compared to other cryptos. I couldn't think of a better metric to show bitcoin's inevitable decline.


Exactly. What's the problem? Just like bitcoin people decided alicecoin had value.

No the transaction that had the highest fee, over $800 was a single transaction with lots of inputs due to the way I received my bitcoin.

So what alternative to openssl do you recommend that has never had security vulnerabilities discovered? Since you called openssl legacy I assume you're using what you consider to be a more modern alternative? I'm surprised you found something with no serious security vulnerabilities ever discovered. That's pretty darn rare. I'd love to know what it is.


Care to explain or is this just more shilling?

what are we doing to recover your funds? praying someone else can recover them!

Yes he should have read more, but this is definitely bitcoin's fault and may very well lead to its downfall. You can't use it as a currency in its current form if every time you go to use it you have to pay $40+ in fees. I just went to move my coins for the first time in 2 years and the lowest fee I could select without manual input in bitcoin core was $175.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:13:29
any idea what the minimum should be to get confirmed?

No it would have been retarded for them to continue using bitcoin. Just like pretty much everyone else at the time. Why start using bitcoin again if it's just going to happen again?
