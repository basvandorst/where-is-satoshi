How is providing everything from, transaction amounts, addresses, account info, IP addresses, miner info etc etc etc etc etc, simple?
I provided everything possible to prove my identity, yet they require one thing that actually does not prove my identity.. 
Why do I feel like I am debating a troll?
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:31:09
Firstly, that's not the issue. They will remove the 2FA if I give them the selfie with ID. But this does not prove ownership of my account.
How is this not a graspable concept.
I could give them your photo and ID and they would unlock MY account. Yet you think this is safe and logical?

@_date: 2014-10-13 18:14:19
With this logic, I could provide them with your photo and ID and they would remove the 2FA, and this seems logical to you..?

And if you think that it was all immediately cashed out, you're nuts. It's still trickling out and will continue to do so. As Bitmain is not stupid enough to cash out all at once and fuck the market that they have cornered.
The same thing happened last year when BFL finally started shipping. Then the value soared. So fuck off. Buckle up. And get ready for the next wave of value increase.

The only cogent thought I see here is in the first paragraph where you state the obvious. 
The rest of this OP is nonsensical, trite and falls off topic.

If they require a specific value for X for validation but there's no way to prove the specific value of X. 
That doesn't pose a logically problem for you?

SO far every crypto "news" site and blog I've seen/read are completely filled with hacks who kiss the arse of the industry.
They all started out with the same mandate. To promote cryptos to get hits and profit off said hits.
They will kiss anyone's arse to get free money.
They're not exactly in it to help or report as they are not filled with "real" reporters who will actually be objective or critical.

I really appreciate your candor and the thought you put in to your responses. Especially because my criticism can easily be taken as trolling.
I assure you, I am genuinely concerned about this and how it is destructive to the bitcoin ecosystem; though I don't take the time to articulate my concerns.
Let me first state that you seem like a nice person and you write very well. I enjoy your writing, just not most of the direction and subjectivity you have for your topics. Which, of course, leads me to my opinion that crypto bloggers are hacks and kiss the arse of the industry.
I can clearly see what you were doing with the piece on Louis C.K. 
* You want to promote BTC as the best option for online sales. Fair enough.
* You want to use a trendy media piece to promote your own work. Fair enough.
* You want to take PayPal down a notch by showing how BTC could save money on the same level playing field. Fair enough.
Those really are the three major aspects of your piece. It's clearly not objective. Unless you honestly believe that Bitcoin has the same level of useability and adoption as PayPal. Then you're clearly out to lunch.
Furthermore, how is using the convenience of the PayPal/Louis C.K. incident not self-serving? You could have written a well researched article of how Bitcoin could be used for international travel. Because, IF you know as much as claim, then you'd know that a $5 transaction is not exactly what Bitcoin is best for. Especially at this stage of development.
Who wants to wait the time it would take to load up the wallet, methodically ensure the transaction information is correct, then wait for confirmations and then delivery for a piece of media?
I can load Steam right now, click a game, add it to my cart, two more clicks, a password and two more clicks and I'm downloading said game. Roughly 20 seconds and I'm downloading what I just purchased.
PayPal is a very viable answer for these kinds of purchases right now. Bitcoin is in no way able to replace that as a option. Supplement? Sure. Bitcoin is an option.
Your piece was self-serving and hacky. It doesn't matter how long you've been involved in Bitcoin. Fluffing up some kind of dreamworld is just as bad as the hardware ponzi scheme's, of which I am VERY aware of. Having purchased from 3 major manufacturers and mining since 2011, I have witnessed many of horrific aspects of the ecosystem. 
Perhaps you should write a piece about how the other bloggers are hacks and give yourself some credibility and REAL hits to your website.
Or do you have the testes?

Duh, back up within a few mins of me posting this.
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:04:00
The first thing I found was the piece on Louis CK. I have to say, my research is not off to a good start.
Bitcoin as an option;yes. But how is BTC better than using PayPal when PayPal is more widely used?
I call BS on that piece right now.
BTC as an option. Sure.
You're seriously slanted on that one.
I'll read further, but I think you're not going to get many kind words regarding being objective. You seem quite subjective and that's the opposite of what bitcoin needs. Radical change doesn't come from conformists. Especially those who pretend to be the voice of change.
@_date: 2014-09-25 16:07:38
Three major shifts of BTC have happened since August.
Why the hell am I the only one who knows this and understand how economics works?
Bitmain sells millions of dollars worth of Antminers, Ethereum raises millions in initial offerings and then jackasses panic sell.
Three major reasons why the value in $ has gone down. Millions and millions have been recently cashed out.
There. Simple enough for you?

Yea.. Maybe we should start a new Alt in his honour and donate all the pump and dump profits from the premine to his protection detail.

perhaps you don't understand. if they have nothing to reference my uploaded ID to, then how does that serve to provide validation?

Your reply is probably the best thing I have seen in in a long time.
Thank you for taking the time to understand the issue and I find it refreshing that you have looked at the issue from another angle other than the obvious tolls in here.
Having my ID in case of a dispute, would be one of the only reasons why it seems necessary for them to ask, but otherwise defeats the purpose after the funds are withdrawn.
Though at the end of the day, I think the only point that matters is that the CS rep is just a monkey enforcing a blanket rule of ID uploading, though it's completely arbitrary and serves no purpose in this case. Which, of course, is the purpose for this post; to expose who stupid their system is.
And I can see from the downvotes, that there are either a lot of CEX shills, illiterate or trolls in here, because I've made this point quite clear and it's very obvious there's an issue with it.
Agree or disagree, I'm just the messenger. Downvoters can f*ck themselves.
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:27:13
I didn't say bitcoin died. Don't assume or claims that I have made this claim.
But since I made my initial statement, it has lost almost 50% of it's value and it's still failing and now we see a lot of infrastructure failing with it.
Care to redact your statement?
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:49:42
current value solely based on USD is severely flawed logic.
2 years ago I could still turn a profit while mining. now, it's non-possible.

That's the most ridiculous thing I've read in a weeks.
Something does not need to die to evolve, in fact, death is extinction and evolution is the exact opposite of death.

Being irresponsible with $500mn of other people's money and having it squandered, lost and stolen.. And he's still talking about it like it's a shock to him.
I would have lost 75% of my coins had I not pulled them out just 4 days before.

I will start with the easiest issue. How and where to store your btc once you have them.
I personally use the original bitcoin wallet to store my coins.
 will show you some options. The original is bitcoin-qt. It's easily encrypted and very straight forward. Some other wallets have more options, but as far as safety is concerned, QT is probably the safest.
Trusting an online wallet to a private individual is risky. Not only to crooked owners of said site, but to hackers as well.
Now to purchase btc. The safest way is in person with a local seller. In a public place, using your laptops/phones. That way, you can physically hold your cash until you see the btc enter your virtual wallet.
Secondly, there are a few good trading sites available. I personally use Mt.Gox. Adding money via international bank transfer, buying btc and then transferring them to my wallet on my PC. Then I can use them via the other online trading sites or hoard them.
If I was in the US, I would probably use BitInstant. 
Try to use companies who have applied to be money transmitters. This seems to be the biggest hurdle in legal terms, for doing fiat/btc transactions. 
The US is struggling to shut down all companies who transact money, virtual and real, who have not gotten a license to be money transmitters.
Not to scare you, but I'd hate to give you advice and have you lose your funds or have your account frozen because of the exchange company not following the US rules.
