Well, it seems that Kraken requires a scanned ID plus Picture of you with your ID for everyone in Germany regardless of the amount you want to trade. Honestly, I don't trust any company that much.
Back to square one, I guess.

Oh nice, still time to participate!

The latter, I think.

I second this! I cannot seem to find any option (at least for Germans) to trade without ID. Some 1.5 years ago, I tried Kraken and Germans were among a few that required ID.

exactly my point. It is strange how wide panic can undermine a justice system.

This was exactly my thought, plus: lifelong supervision? whats that got to do with rehabilitation? I don't u derstand that country. Once they make out an enemy (and ISIS is surely a fierce one) this seems to legitimize any deviance from their system of prosecution.
EDIT: spelling

fascinating, I have no clue what this whole post is about. I guess I am still a btc noob after all.
