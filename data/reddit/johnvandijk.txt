No more!

If you can, buy some more to get your avg down.
Else, hodl. Eventually it will get back there.

Could you share the name of this app?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:20:33
What was the usual number (range) of pending transactions? Pre-hyperactive market?

This recovery could be slower than expected.

Thanks a lot for taking the time!
Holy shit, this is scary.

Serious fuckery by Coinbase. 
I think I’m moving off it very very soon. Check their iOS update release notes.
They won’t be supporting segwit2x now.

Hadn't it gone up to 200k though? It will take a few good hours to come down though.

6300 wall is big!
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:53:49
You know what, I don’t disagree!

Here's my 2 mBTC, In a coordinated attack on BTC, or in other words, going by the market sentiment, lots of people dumped BTC for bitcoin cash taking its value to 2800, a lot of miners saw the greater profitability in mining bitcoin cash, BTC lost a lot of hashing power and transactions piled up. Bitcoin cash difficulty just got adjusted and mining BTC is much more (2.8) times profitable than mining BCH. So hashing power is coming back to BTC now and the transactions should clear in 30-50 hours.

As the ugly coin crashes, its gonna keep going up. Already 2.72 as ugly coin comes down to 1380.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:19:58
Look at what money you can lose without much of a trouble, put in in BTC now, ain't gonna go much lower than 5819.

What app is this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:29
2.8 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:36:18
Check it again in 6 hours when some hashing power comes back to Btc from the other thing.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:33
Can you share a summary of what the bill says?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:25:48
And it will again, but today’s fight against the 6300 wall is clearly one of the biggest obstacles for a rally in the recent past.

What’s curios is that even though bch has lost a lot, a lot of the market cap hasn’t come back to btc, maybe a billion stuck in transactions at the moment, but nowhere near the previous. Most people have only lost in this attack.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:12
If transactions for higher price purchases are stuck, wouldn't that boost price?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:45
Nope, always good to have some hashing power.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:59:41
You should look into buying some BTC when its low!

GDax is showing serious signs of manipulation.
There's huge selling off each time the price goes up by 50-100 bringing it right back.
