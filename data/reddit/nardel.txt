Firelord Dimon. I love this video so much.

Ah, yes well thank you for linking it for me! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:06:35
I'm sure they put out a statement and stopped the FUD right away. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:44:46
Yup,  Just zoom out and realize the amount it’s raised I the past year and hope for the best. Depending on and you invested it matters more.

They're forking themselves is that I thought.

Teeth stealer!

I just don't know when to buy in. I see the dip go down to $3,900 and think i should get some. But I don't want to buy in $100 and see it dip lower. i'm so torn. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 04:48:49
Not you're teeth stop thanking people for them. 
They're teeth. 
This comment feels weird to type. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:24:47
I'm confused, why not wait for the next dip at the spike? Doesn't that mean that you're not buying in when all the excitement is happening and losing later. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 04:42:12
naaaaaah you didn't. Actual pumpkin carver VVVVVVVV

I’ve been close to losing friends because I talk about it too much. I really can’t bring it up that much for fear of starting an argument. 
One guy tried to egg me on a a party and I had to just cut him off. Plz send new friends.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:01:06
no argument here, I'm fine with these prices.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:41:37
There's a lot in there i didn't understand, but i'll try to ask the right questions. 
So, this "fork" is a misnomer. It's more like split with a both chains recombining later? If we wait to make those transactions until after it resolves, with the replay protection be in place? 
And how will we know if the transaction goes through both chains if we only send to 1 wallet address on 1x? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:14:43
I have limited understanding of the programming and tech behind the whole project, but why would we want this without replay protection?
After reading this thread I see 2x isn’t going to be parallel, but part of the same chain? 
Soooo there’s a good chance if I send btc that I’ll loose it? No fucking way. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:32:43
From what I've see all over cryptotwitter, they have the same sentiment. No?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:40:19
Shit you’re right. 
That is how it works though. The more people buy in, use it and mine the higher the price goes and the people that bought in low see profits. We’re not gaining off referrals like bitconnect. If you’re worried about people thinking it’s a pyramid scheme then educate, I have to almost every day. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:12:27
Make it stop. Who the fuck are these people though? Trezor posted some good info today, and I’m sure there will be more info over the next month. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:10:56
If they don’t buy, we don’t see gains and can’t take their money.

Prime suspect for hodling.

He was talking about Ohio excepting tax payments in bitcoin. Everyone has a bitcoin guy. We all are that guy. I think it may have been a jab at all the bitcoin guys and they are fucking with us. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:55:53
Correct 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:56:23
Which episode?
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:57:11
There had to be one guy in that office that was like “uhhh wait that’s not right!” Then they made it a joke because they want to fuck with us. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:35:39
This whole thread turned racist and worse. It fucking sucks.  
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:07:20
ATMs always throw me off though because the price per token is always higher. So why would I buy there and not on Coinbase or other token retail sites? 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:09:02
If only there were a faster means of transfer that didn’t need as much time for verification so we could all move money more quickly and still have complete trust in the system. 
One day.

The price per token is always wrong too. Last week one in my area was off by $1000. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:15:42
Fuck that. Just learn and use 1 of the online exchanges. These these give people a very false idea of what Cryptos are capable of right now.
