Agreed. If you leave the coins on an exchange long enough the coins will be stolen. Considering that risk and that Bitcoin itself has appreciated multiple orders of magnitude in the last 5 years I would need to triple my coins every 4 months for the risk to be worthwhile. I'm certainly not capable of doing that.

I've been here from 2012 and I did not mine all my coins - on the contrary l bought them all on exchanges (MtGox to be specific). Never lost a coin because i buy or sell and I immediately withdraw.

You are just lying. If you’d be around you would remember dates VERY WELL, those were very intense days in which few people were involved. 
In 2013 there were no $20 asic. In March 2013 the first ASICS were shipped to the public by Yifu Guo’s Avalon. It was a run limited to 300 machines, each one costed $1500 and netted around 300 bitcoins if i remember correctly. First person to receive one was At the same time ButterflyLabs was pre-selling ASICS that delivered super late, among them an $80 “Jalapeño” miner. Later that year (October) KnCMiner delivered their “Saturn” miner - the cost of each one was aprox. 6k usd. Anyhow: there were no $20 ASICS on the market. Not in 2013, not in 2014. And if you had an asic miner in 2013 or 2014 you would remember very well.

At current price its a good 30% of my portfolio, and do you know what? I'm not sweating at all.
Firstly, when I first invested (jan 2013) I only invested what I could afford to lose - since then the price has increased x30. It might be 30% of my portfolio now, but its still a fucking gift.
Secondly, and more important, I understand the fundamentals: they are rock solid. I got in immediately after I heard about BTC the first time because I had an intuition. That intuition has been backed by every single fact I've come to learn about Bitcoin since that very first day I rushed to buy that crazy currency of the hackers on the internet.
It has all the indicators - it empowers people, it endangers the status quo, it is distributed and decentralized and it cannot be stopped by "traditional means", hackers and geeks love it, youngsters understand it while old people doesn't... This is a revolution my friends. The chance of the revolution failing exist and denying them would be foolish, but every day that passes the chance of BTC going away are slimmer and slimmer. It is not a coinflip any more. It is not a 50/50 bet. Cryptos are here TO STAY, this is for sure, and looking at the indicators you can bet quite safely on BTC still going into at least one more mania phase. Do not forget we've already been here, summer of 2011 was MUCH worst but BTC simply didn't go away BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SOLID AND UNTOUCHED.
All in all, posts like yours junkit33 just demonstrate that this is a very good moment to buy and that the interim bottom is very close.

Bitcoin is much more than an "asset" or an "investment": it is a revolution, and its fundamentals are still rock solid. It is winning, regardless of the current bear market.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:27:54
Then they should have invested only an amount they could afford to lose on the first place. Giving past history, the most likely scenario is that BTC will recover and go into a bull run again, but heavy volatility is expected. Therefore investing more than one can afford to lose is a huge mistake, because you will get overemotional and make mistakes.
One of those mistakes is selling during the bear market as some suggest: you did bet on this motherfucker? Then you should know that in 2011 and early 2013 price went down dramatically before recovering and breach ATH again. 
Just fucking sell when it is going up and BUY when it is going down - how difficult is that to understand?

No, read again. I wrote I bought bitcoins *the very first day i learnt about them*, it is obvious I didn't know a lot about them, but just reading the Bitcoin Wikipedia entry I had this intuition about *not beingle able to afford being out of this revolution*. After that I passed 80% of my days reading and reading about Bitcoin and I realized that every single fact I was learning just backed that intuition I had.

You say "production quotas do not work".
A production quota is simply a limit on production to control the supply of a certain good.
The 21M bitcoins hard cap is the ultimate production quota. You know it is. Now explain us again why "production quotas" do not work. Or maybe you are thinking about raising the BTC supply indefinitely via inflation just because "production quotas do not work"?

The founders of anarchism (Kropotkin, Proudhon, Bakunin) were all deeply anti-capitalists. In fact anarchism was born precisely as a reaction to the rise of capitalism in the first half of 1800, and that's why at the beginning they were allies of Marx and the communists.  
Bakunin and other anarchists become anti-communists during the 2nd IWPA, circa 1889. 
Anarchists were against all kinds of coercive power, and they considered capitalism as a coercive force per se. Their logic was that when a person can own the means of production and the fruits of the labor of others, this person can have wage slaves. They reasoned that in a capitalist society the vast majority of people is forced to either work for others or to starve. They compared the "freedom" in choosing your career path to the freedom to choose between being shot or hanged. Obviously think that we are speaking about the society of the end of XIX Century.
Summing up, anarchists wanted workers to directly own the fruits of their labor and self-managing factories, farms, etc. They were anti-communist because:
* they didn't believe in any kind of dictatorship, even if it was for the "proletariat". This is the most important point.
* they didn't believe that workers needed parties formed by an elite, or other vertical organizations to organize themselves, to lead the revolution or to manage the production of goods.
* they believed every worker needed to own the fruits of their labor, and thus were against having a central committee collecting and re-distributing the goods, etc.
The list goes on. You then have different types of approaches (Kropotkin's anarcho-comunism, Bakunin's anarcho-collectivism, Proudhon's mutualism, etc.), but all were anti-capitalists in the sense that they were against of private property of the means of production (basically farms, land and factories). 
Anarcho-capitalism is a thing only in the US, a country where "real" anarchism never took hold. For a European all this american talk about rothbardian "anarcho-capitalism" is pretty weird/funny because the word in itself is an oxymoron, kinda like "religious-atheism".

's position:


* I do not agree that Bitcoin needs scaled this very moment. I would have been happy with a version of SegWit that also halved the block size limit to compensate for the increased capacity. IMO, a whole lot still needs done before scaling is desirable and technically sound. The increased capacity of SegWit is a compromise I am willing to make, seeing that the fee discount on witness transactions realigns incentives in favor of utxo consolidation (helps keep the UTXO set in check)
* I disagree with BU's primary principle that the block size should be decided by user and miner vote. I disagree with the block size hardcap on the grounds that it is a magic number. Voting on a magic number does not improve upon this limitation. The only acceptable solution in my eyes is an algorithmic one. To imagine a technical metric is best discovered by popular vote is wishful thinking at best.
* I disagree with BU's design choice in regard of the vote. There are plenty of simpler and more efficient ways to achieve what BU sets out to do than to signal block size per node/miner in a gossip model.
* I disapprove of BU's implementation of that design (EC), on the grounds that it does not achieve what BU set out to do. It is an awkward and convoluted piece of code that tries to hide behind its complexity and an unjustified amount of pointless parameters the fact that only miners effectively have any say over the block size.
* I've had a few discussions with Peter R in the past and I strongly disagreed with his understanding of Bitcoin and his take on the project's development. I suspect I will disagree basically anything he has to say today, seeing the path BU has taken.
* I strongly disapprove of the announced BU miners attack on the Core chain in the event of a fork. I wish to forever dissociate with the people that suggested and support that infamy.
* I have a distaste for the bickering over Bitcoin's name and Satoshi's legacy that people are engaging in. I care neither for the name nor for the posturing of legacy. I only care for the technology. To whom the rest is valuable, you can have it.
* I don't particularly care for the incompetence of BU devs. There is too much BU is getting wrong for me to somehow concern myself with how the codebase is maintained. Even if it was top notch, I'd never run it.

Then you are not watching. [Here you have the proposal to have nonzero inflation by Peter Rizun, BU's Chief Scientist]( It starts at 00:05. "We need bitcoin's inflation rate to be non-zero". 


Please read again what you just posted: "any needed rules and incentives can be **enforced** with this consensus mechanism". ENFORCED. Not changed. Not set up. Not decided. 
What the miners vote is what transactions go in what block, in what order. They ENFORCE the consensus rules. They do not decide what are the consensus rules. They just **provide a service for the network and they get paid for it**.

96% of my net worth is Bitcoin so I really hope you are right... But unfortunately I don't buy it. There are ties between all exchanges, ours is still a fragile ecosystem in its infancy in which every major exchange is interconnected. I witnessed the MtGox collapse first hand (and BTW, I took the exit door *before* it was too late) and this feels very similar. When there are USD liquidity problems in a very big exchange (again: hundreds of millions of USD are trapped right) then BTC becomes extremely valuable, everyone needs it because it can move, and price rises.

That's **impossible** to pull off unless you explicitly make your coin non-listable on exchanges by some technical means. Only usable inside the platform. If the token is tradable then the SEC will argue that people had a reasonable expectation of profit.

I just regret not selling during the sucker rally to $160, but I'm quite satisfied with my choice. I made the money I put in BTC back, while I'm still sitting on massive profits that will allow me to enter the 4 figures in BTC club as soon as the price approaches $50.
