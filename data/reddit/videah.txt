Two and Three are too exchange-like for my liking. One has a more "open" feel to it and has quick overview links on first glance which is useful for the average joe.

LocalBitcoins or an ATM.

It's an important abstraction when it comes to software and the internet. You don't need legal regulations on email software or browsers for instance. That would be absurd.

And I think someone smart enough to create bitcoin would understand the implications of owning said wallet. It's also a common assumption by many that Satoshi might be dead.

So does PayPal, doesn't mean anything when it's centralized and my money can be frozen at any time.

TCP/UDP enables all of this and more. Should we ban the internet entirely?
Evidently, fiat suffers from this as well. Should we ban all money?

Can you point to the "enabling terrorism and crime" part of the bitcoin whitepaper? It was designed as a decentralized Austrian econ inspired e-currency using cryptography, nothing more, nothing less. Or do you have a quote from Satoshi that I haven't seen yet?

... What?


You haven't really argued why other than saying it's unethical, only to turn around and say ethics don't matter if we all agree to be unethical.


It is disruptive in the same way cars disrupted the horse and carriage. But that wasn't the argument you were making, you were implying its sole purpose was to facilitate and enable crime. This was what made the internet ok and bitcoin bad in your eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:17:22


I fail to see how this is relevant at all. You're mistaking the creators intentions with the intentions of a small group of citizens, essentially proving my argument for me. Gun manufacturers aren't planning an uprising.


Yeesh, and you were getting on to me about ethics! What right do you have to stop free exchange of value?


You're arguing that your pre perceived notion on why bitcoin was designed is true "because it's clear". If it was clear then you'd be able to present some form of evidence to backup your claim.

You're right, the responsibilty lands on the user. Browsers and email are not unethical because people do unethical things with them. They do just fine without legal regulation because the unethical things are already illegal :)


Can you come up with some example of an "unethical and harmful" use of bitcoin and a relevant form of legal regulation to counter that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:05:24
It's tightly regulated by software and markets. It's just messages being bounced around.

I suggest you stop listening to the media and do your own research because it isn't comparable to Bitcoin in the slightest.

The price would plumit as those coins were considered lost

It can also be fixed by using a BIP39 passphrase (which you should be using anyways)

If only there was some sort of decentralised payment method they could use
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:14:58
It's even possible to have sub-satoshi fees. Things are gonna get cheap as hell.

[I had the exact same idea!]( It does its job just fine, watch out though because I had some temp problems with the case on. Had to take it off to prevent overheating.

Neutrino isn't ready for mainnet as far as I can tell so a full node's still required. This will change in the future though.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:15:03
They said they have it on the roadmap for this year, after the Android version reaches v1.0
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:19:54
Believe me, if that were to happen the currency would be the least of your worries.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:34:08
I'm glad to be one of them :)

[They're putting it on FDroid once it's reached v1.0](

Once lightning officially releases on mainnet you're gonna have to get a wallet that supports it.

If you boot up an old node it will sync with BTC because of consensus rules.
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:01:39
That's kind of what they want.
