Not sure how many of you invest in stocks, but ELRA might be a way for those to invest in the Bitcoin frenzy without having to spend so much cash.  $1000 buys one bitcoin, where it can buy 10,000 shares of ELRA.

Understood and don't get me wrong Bitcoins are awesome.  This is just another way to capitalize on the coming Bitcoin craze.  This stock moves very easily and could very well hit $1 in a month or so heading into the Christmas buying season and with bitcoins moving up.  That is 1000% gain from here.

Here is a stock that deals in Bitcoins. ELRA-Bitcoins are gaining in media exposure and hype as we all know. This 10 M float, 27 M OS stock is the ONLY publicly traded Bitcoin stock out there. ELRA is creating an online casino using Bitcoins in China AND an exchange. With a OS this small, it will not take much to take it much much higher imo. Bitcoins have risen over 5000% recently, so there is no reason this cannot move 1000% of so from here at 9 cents.
Chart looks great and a dollar or more is possible imo based on bitcoins hitting a frenzy like atmosphere.
