What happens once the last bitcoin is mined?  What so the miners do?  What's the hardware good for?  Will nodes stay online for transactions if there is no reward?

PCI would matter. You'd be selling this to folks who also take credit cards.  And if it touches the POS it needs to be PCI compliant.  End of story.

It's a great idea and I like it.  I only mention this as someone who deals with this as part of my work and that answer would make some refuse to look at it at all.  The PCI part would make it worth a mention to the powers that be.

FYI, I intentionally didn't post my public key or a link because I didn't want to appear to be begging for bitcoins.  I just thought it was really neat I could set it up through this site's 'alternate funds' method.
Though if you're feeling crazy generous to some stranger on the interwebs and want to send a satoshi or two to the new couple, shoot me a message.

I would hope this question is more than the op.  We all use smartphones but until adoption is 100% which is a long way off, there needs to be other solutions.

It reminds me of the recent apple split.  By decreasing the entry cost appearance the number of people likely to join in is greater.  If people don't know they can buy part of a coin it appears that they entry is $500 when in fact it can just be a couple bucks.  Just like apple was keeping people out at several hundred per share. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:46:40
It should be very little.  Would you trade good Mac 'n cheese for crappy because they take a different payment?   Now extend that to medical - a dentist that does a good job, or one that takes bitcoin?  Hmmmm
This is where you say they may provide as good or better service, not necessarily worse.  You would be right, but only maybe.  If you have twenty dentists to choose from on your area, you can select the best.  If you now whittle that down to two that take bitcoin, the chance of the best being in the bitcoin selection is now only 10%.  That's worse than gambling on Gox.  
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:54:08
I can tell by responses like this that the superiority circle jerk is here.  It's not about begging or using name calling.  It's about finding a solution.  Abandoning apple is NOT a good solution.  Would credit cards, cash, paypal, etc work if HALF the people couldn't use it?  No.  This isn't about making bitcoin one ring to rule them all.  It's about making it usable for all.  Isn't that a goal?  Adoption?  You won't get it with half the people missing.  
Read the op again and look for the real topic rather than your knee jerk "apple sucks" thoughts.

You would trade the same info buying online for bitcoin and credit card.  They need a shipping address for both.   Tell me what more does a merchant get when buying  online with a credit card vs bitcoin?
And no bitcoin is not any easier.  They are the same or even easier as credit (thanks to saved fields). 
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:30:29
If you think people will ditch apple and the things they DO like about it for bitcoin that currently is difficult and of no value to them...  Well... Try again

I think you missed my point.  It has to be easily available to all to create adoption.  Jailbreak is not that.

Explain exactly how much personal information is transmitted to that merchant.  I know but I don't believe you do. 
Hint: merchants don't get that much info.  Almost none actually.  The card issuers have that.  And you gave it to them initially.

Exactly.  This circle jerk is miserable.  I will go to who provides the best quality-value I combination of a service - medical, dining, banking, etc.  How they accept payment is NOT part of the equation.

I have bought via bofa in USA from coinbase directly.  
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:55:56
Wrong.  You can't take a new concept all the way with less than 50% market share.  If you want bitcoin to be successful you have to make it available to all.  If you want to do that you have to provide it on their devices, not require those people to change those devices (which are expensive, customized, and likely on contract)
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:42:23
So in an effort to legitimize Bitcoin coinbase acts responsibly for an idiot doing illegal activity in a stupid manner and coinbase is the bad guy?   Ugh.

They announced it last week.  And automated POS integration for these is a long way off.  You don't need to sell this to a brand - you need to sell it to the POS manufacturers - Micros, Squirrel, NCR, etc.

Horrible idea.  I scanned it at multiple times in the animation and it gave back different results.  You want a QR to always deliver the SAME results.

Um... no... what you pointed out was a straw-man argument.  I did a quick search for "string man" and "scarecrow + string theory" and actually ended up at the closest relevant link talking about, you guessed it: STRAW MAN.

While I understand the issues with iPhone, if the real goal is to get user acceptance and more widespread activity, you HAVE to show how it can be done on iPhone.  ANY product that addresses ONLY iPhone or Android and not the other is missing out on half the market.  Paypal, online banking, stock trading apps, etc -- none of these would be truly successful if focusing on one platform and abandoning the other.
The challenge will now be making that iPhone experience even better.  As they are making the apps difficult for approval, building better, more secure web portals will be the immediate answer.
But really my point is - you must include iPhone, even if it's difficult, or many won't relate/join in.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:45:56
straw man, not string man.  
This shows, again, that what you are putting on paper is not necessarily what you are thinking.  Being able to communicate your ideas is key to having them accepted and understood by others.

It's useful in the sense that if that happens to you, and is trusted (real), and happens to others (likely), the supply is significantly smaller.  This can create an imbalance knowing that the actual available is different than the stated available.

They sell at a discount but it allows them to reach a larger audience.  Starbucks and Home Depot and subway can all advertise online or in a grocery store in a sense.  Markdown on cards generally still outweighs margins and overspend. 
As for why they haven't adopted themselves, it's easy - POS integration.  Solve that, and your large scale acceptance will grow.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:47:01
So how is that different than PayPal, banking apps, and square 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:57:15
Agreed.  A handful of decent ones.  But like the WOW forum it's a bunch of trash.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:21:05
To be fair, expecting 10% to come from bitcoin is crazy.  Even paypal doesn't have that.  And is much easier and widespread.

This is not a typo.  "comptuer" or "computerr" or "computr" are all typos.  Mixing up both there/their and your/you're are not typos.  They are issues  with understanding and/or using the language.

@_date: 2013-11-28 22:47:02
But we can't know if the decreased usage is due to hoarding or due to loss.  You have to assume all are available.  There's no way to prove lost.  Otherwise they wouldn't be lost.

Really?  So we should just encourage improper use?  Regardless of whether you can infer the correct meaning or not, this is not acceptable.  As you read on, you see this is not just something that happened once, but several times, in several different word situations.  Additionally, using 'string man' vs 'straw man'.  As more posts go on, it is pointed out that the OP has no idea what they are talking about in general.  Which proves even further that the issues with the communication equate to issues in the content.

@_date: 2013-12-11 01:30:15
On the contrary.  Large chains generally do NOT use custom.  Not in the sense you're stating.  They generally use off-the-shelf products.  There may be some custom tweaks to them, but this is not that type of thing that would be included as it requires much more work than those minor customizations are capable of.

I'm not sure you understand what goes into those.  The software is one thing.  Scanning of the barcode is another.  Then comes payment processing, and integration live with a merchant account.

If you want your material to be considered as serious, it should be correct.  If someone is pitching to me and I see repeated misuse of these same issues, no excuse like 'psychological disorder' will excuse them.  They are a reflection of what they are trying to convey (here, your message.. for me, my business).

By paying through another device like a tablet, they can use bitpay to deposit into an account (owner's personal then transfer for example, or business acct directly).  With larger multi-location businesses, there isn't the ease of handing out account info to each location.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:53:03
Again, it's the POS integration.  It's how you process that.  It's how the POS confirms payment and closes the ticket.  This has to be built into POS software.  It cannot live separate in these large-scale situations.  Until that exists, no luck.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:37:05

@_date: 2013-12-11 01:24:15
You're right... I didn't create one, because it's a bad idea.  If you understand how they work, you understand that.  You want 100% of scans to be correct.  Animated QRs reduce that number.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:50:54
"supposed to"... I live in a world where you must always factor in the things that happen when you don't do what you're supposed to.  And in this instance, I scanned while moving (as some people absolutely will).  And it took me elsewhere.  
It remains a poor product as-is.

For non-credit card transactions.  This doesn't talk about direct cc payment, which is all transactions.  Not just alternative transactions.
