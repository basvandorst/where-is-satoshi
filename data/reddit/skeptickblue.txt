Yes, precisely! Thanks for commenting. This is my first time posting on Reddit. Am I part of the family now? :)
Anyway I was thinking of some kind of crowd funding website like Kickstarter where we can ensure the scientist is using the money for the science. We could also track the progress, etc. I'll figure out how to set up the subreddit you suggest. 
One thing I've noticed is that some of my friends who have made big bucks with bitcoins are just cashing out (USD) and then buying things. This is just supporting consumerism and the all mighty dollar. We should start thinking in ways to leverage the power of bitcoin now, not waiting for it to usurp the dollar (that might take a while and not even be via another cryptocurrency). We could donate to scientists and then have them buy equipment at places that accept bitcoin. Keep it in the loop!

That makes sense that its illegal to donate directly to scientists. That might constitute a bias. I just gave the dude money because I liked his research and its really the only way I can show support besides emailing him. 
That is not what I was saying. There should be a crowdsourcing for us to use bitcoin to fund science. There are already several out there like that for USD donations.

Great idea about graduate student travel. My friend has been in the same boat -- he's a math graduate student and they give him no travel funding.
