people shouldnt be raped, murdered, sold to slavery, or forced to watch Ghost Hunters, but the world is a shitty fucking place. Learn to protect yourself.

Uh, that depends on the documents you sign beforehand. I've again, made it very clear that my shit is my shit, her shit is her shit. She seems okay with it.

I've made it very clear to my SO that if they dont invest a little, they will be left behind and my spoils wont be theirs to share due to their lack of participation.   
If she put in money and lost 100%, I'd share my earnings down the line. But if she doesnt put in a single cent, she aint getting a single fucking cent. Clear as day - no arguments involved.

So... what exactly does she do to fix her own financial situation if shes so against your success? :D

CMC wont beat yahoo because yahoo provides a lot of news when it comes to the markets. If CMC started doing legitimate journalism, they may become bigger than that page one day.

I dunno. Things are going very well on our end. Its nice to know that she doesnt assume she owns my shit because she said "yes". There is no sense of entitlement, and my things are treated with respect. And its nice to know I dont magically own her shit just because I asked to live together forever. And I treat her things with respect because she worked hard for them.

I should make a shitcoin and just start calling it Bitcoin also. /s

Well, is finally turning on Roger with this misinformation bullshit. At least some of them are.

If you have a single track mind such as this, you're batshit crazy.

LOL Why does the thumbnail look like the girl from Google who just broke the PI calculation record?   
Edit:[Its her!!!](

Exactly. With a decentralized system, there isnt a single switch.

Anyone got any links to solid ELI5 info on Segwit as a whole? 
Do exchanges like Bittrex use Segwit now?

I remember seeing it at &lt;$.20. I begged my father. I mean begged. I explained what $1000 could do if this even remotely became a thing, and begged for $250 - $500. I was a kid who just spent all his money buying Flash to learn animation, so I was broke.  
$1000 would be $30m+. Granted I woulda sold at the $1200 marker.

You know what else is moronic? Assuming someone cant afford to lose $300k. Not everyone can, but some will be able to. This individual was one.

Who the fuck is dumb enough to believe someone else actually owns land on the moon, to even sell from the start?

FTFY - Dont put what you're not ready to lose. Not saying you deserve to lose it - Saying your family doesnt deserve to be put at risk because you decided to invest in crypto.

Sending money to an unknown /small business is a gamble.  
If youre that fucking comfortable pushing your life savings to some unknown recipient, I've got the deal of a lifetime for you. Just send over your life savings to my LLC and we'll take care of the rest.

Shhh coinbase might hear you and find a way to charge insane fees on this idea.

imo medical records shouldnt be able to be "changed". Only amended.
