Because they don't want bitcoin to scale.
They want it's own power to scale. 
Push a fork because they don't like a date is merely stupid.

Yes may be Antpool, when you declare war a counterattack is the most likely event. 
They can also publicly declare the attack and say "we do it now to protect the bitcoin network, we demonstrate the issues of this network before it starts".

They don't split the chain if they have 100% HR.

I think an attacker would wait at least a day before attack. This is due to give a sufficient advantage to avoid reorg to the non uasf chain  (for statistical causes). 
You don't see the hash rate of the uasf chain grow up because an reorg attack is competitive not cooperative, so we have max(uasfHR, uasfAttackHR) not  (uasfHR+ausfAttackHR). This is explained here:  
If the hash power distibution is 32% usaf vs. 68% legacy after a day the legacy chain will be ~50 blocks ahead (for simplycity we assume a costant pow per block) and then they can attack the uasf whitout any risk because the hash power distribution will be:
34% attacker
34% lecacy
0% uasf (it was 33% but each block created will get a wipeout and "will be lost in time, like tears...in rain.")
You say "nobody will trust that person" but "nobody will trust ANY person" is the basic rule on top witch bitcoin works, so that is not a problem.
In a normal situation fee and block reward are the Keystone to ensure blockchain stability this is because the miners get the maximum reward to collaborate.
In the uasf scenario the max profit for miners-against-uasf is obtained when the uasf chain fails.

1 block each 16+h, a network that can be attacked by a commodore 64. 
33% is the lower lower theoretical limit to ensure UASF chain survival.

The chain attack will be a problem if the chain has a low hash rate. 
You can read this article on medium who explain the problem:
The 33% limit is a theoretical limit witch requires a perfect management of the attack and a total agreement of non UASF miners in that case an attack is almost impossible. But the risk of attack grows when uasf hash power goes to zero. 
The proposed attack is only one of many possible attack, normally miners does not try to attack a chain because of the Nakamoto's consensus (they will lost the reward and an attacked coin will lost market shares) but when the goal is to kill a chain an attack is the most likely event.
