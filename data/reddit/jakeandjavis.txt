Considering a single contract is for 5 BTC, I highly doubt you have the balls and/or capital to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:04
Lol - it quite literally is, do you not know the difference between a 2 billion dollar market cap and a market cap over a quarter trillion? Anyone can make a little infographic chart buddy; it works until it doesn't. You could apply that to a multitude of things which it accurately applies to and a multitude of things which it doesn't accurate apply to; e.g. see [Housing Bubble] , e.g. see [Tech Bubble]

I don't think anyone's life savings is gonna be a significant amount worth stealing, nor do I think that you'd have the willpower to give back a "significant amount"; i.e. millions of dollars.
Not like that scenario is ever going to come up, but just saying - being real and admitting someone is going to have a bad day if they accidentally put a private wallet key out there that has a million plus on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:21:32
Still don't know what you're saying man, lol - is sending BTC to a paper wallet going to be cheaper from an exchange like Gemini or from a wallet like Exodus? Or both the same?

Why are you so angry
Take a Chillcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:50
Crypto market cap was way smaller back then, though. That's like comparing a 2-story house that burned down and collapsed to a 50-story skyscraper that would have to come down now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:28:19
Meh, better comparison is stocks (i.e. most stocks do not pay out dividends; the price is what someone will pay for it; which tends to coincide with the company's underlying success).

You're saying if someone made a dumb mistake and posted their private wallet key with 1,000 BTC on it right now, and you were able to obtain it before anyone else, that you'd give all of it back?
Pretty goofy hypothetical, but come on man.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:50:23
Wow, shocking - an order that's 0.000067 percent of BTC's market cap didn't change it at all

Seriously, I mean, obviously I love as much as the next person the increasing adoption &amp; money flowing into crypto, but so many people seem to not give a single fuck about the underlying technology that is literally going to revolutionize the world - and it's going to do so even if Bitcoin crashes to a fraction of a penny.

Let's be real for a second lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:20:48
Is that basic transfer even if I sent BTC from an exchange to a wallet, or just wallet-wallet? Was considering getting some family members ~25 USD in BTC each for Christmas in form of paper wallet, but doesn't seem worth it if those are the txn fees right now... (sorry for the nooby question, haven't moved any BTC around since earlier this Summer).
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:15:06
True, but exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini are far different than places like Mt. Gox. They are fully-regulated &amp; insured (granted only in USD) federal exchanges, just like a stock broker.

Lol, the derivatives market trades in numbers that are so astronomically huge that they sound like a number made up by a 5-year old.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:00:39
Unless you're day trading, wtf kind of price drop are you waiting for? Get in or don't. Back to triple digits? Bitcoin is either destined to hit an enormous market cap potentially more than ten-fold what it is now, or just crash &amp; burn to oblivion. It's not gonna float around where it is now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:11:54
Why do you care, though? Unless you're a day trader you should be in on bitcoin for one of two reasons; to use it as an exchange medium (i.e. over the course of 5 or so minutes, during which the chance of a huge price swing is unlikely) or to long it.

Yes, this is a market with more money involved in it than even exists in the world ten times over. Highly doubt there will be a "taming" to bitcoin, but it will certainly assist in moving toward more widespread adoption of Bitcoin and thus crypto as a whole.

This sub is basically just r/wsb at this point. Part of me actually hopes BTC crashes back down to single digits; I'll take that hit to 25% of my portfolio if it means people learn to do their own fucking research before throwing money into a financial market that they know nothing about.

Bitcoin tends to go on these ~2-5% waves after hitting milestones (i.e. 7,500); it's done it at 1k, 2k, 2.5k, 5k, and so forth. Looks like 7k is going to hold from here on out until the next big crash (which could definitely be the fork).

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:09:06
Consulting with r/bitcoin to invest in bitcoin is actually really fucking dumb. Do your own research and decide for yourself; it's your money, not ours.
Sorry to sound like a dick but it's the truth, and I see these stupid ass posts in investing forums all the time "wat do wit moniez idk how market works".
Keep it in a fucking shoe box, checking account, or mutual fund until you know what you're throwing your money at.
edit: That being said - at least from personal experience - going all in and investing in risky securities and commodities is best done when young; it's alot easier to recover from losing your networth of 5-10k when you can't even legally buy alcohol yet than it is to lose 25k+ when you have a mortage and 2 kids. Investing in volatile markets is akin to gambling; moreso a form of gambling such as poker than say roulette or craps, i.e. if you know what you're doing you can have an overall edge, but it's still gambling nonetheless and you can easily lose all of it if you're not on top of your game.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:16:11
You are so full of shit lmao
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:31:21
All you want is reassurance/feel good from people whom you assume know more about Bitcoin price movement than you do, be fucking real.
In the end, it's your money and your responsibility - also, worth noting in this context, that there are 10x as many "financial experts" (i.e. people who know more about financial markets than you, just like how you're seeking people who are "crypto experts) who think Bitcoin is a sham and is going to crash like a mother fucker; so that alone just shows that you want reassurance for your buy that you did without much research - if you really wanted to listen to the experts you'd find a way to bet against Bitcoin, not invest in it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:49:59


Do you have an unlimited supply of money or something? I don't think you know what trading means.
e.g. You have 5.5k to work with. Buy 1 BTC at ~5500, sell 1 BTC at 7500, buy back in with 7500 when BTC is at 6500, and you now have 1.16 BTCs. BTC goes back to 7500, and you now have 8700 worth of Bitcoin versus the 7500 you would have had if you just held it from 5500.

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:48:34
This analogy is decent, but still kind of flawed. Apple and Amazon were both seen as companies that were almost definitely going to succeed - wasn't really matter of if, just when and to what extent.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:18:42
It wouldn't be bad. I absolutely believe in the cryptocurrency market and its future, but there are a large number of people currently in the community (it is mostly all early adopters, after all) such as Illeny that have no idea how real-world financial markets work and live in their own cult-like Bitcoin bubble (I don't think you're ever going to be able to practically use Bitcoin for everday purchases, at least not how it is now - there are other crypto's stemmed off of Bitcoin for that kind of stuff). 
If crypto is to succeed and become a multi-trillion dollar market, you -need- widespread adoption; and, with that will come institutional investors such as huge hedge funds and future markets. This is not a bad thing whatsoever, it's simply a byproduct of an increase in mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:40:24
If you had even an inkling of knawlodge in regards to volatile markets &amp; uncertainties involved, you'd know with a very high degree of certainty that Bitcoin was going to fall back at least ~10% after the fork cancellation announcement. 
Massive spikes and massive dips don't happen randomly, there is always a catalyst involved. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:53

I think we could definitely see 10k or at least some notable resistance right below it by eoy, but very small chance it will hold.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:44:39
You sound incredibly lazy
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:43:13
If you're just buying at an extreme dip and longing BTC I suppose the fees aren't a huge deal, but personally I tended to trade some of the more extreme swings bitcoin has had over the past few weeks and thus greatly preferred the 0.25% fee over the ~3% (especially considering some of my margins were only ~3-5%).
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:42:40
Get into mid-large cap alt coins. Seriously. Until a couple weeks or so ago I was all Bitcoin, then decided to divest half of that into 9 other alt-coins; trust me, you have way more upside potential and your bets are hedged pretty nicely.

Just the correction beginning from the insane bull run over the past 1-2 weeks; personally I still expect it to breach 10k by January, but still wouldn't be surprised if it dips down to 5k within the next day or two.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:00:33
The thing is, in my opinion at least, bitcoin is either insanely overvalued or insanely undervalued; I don't think there's any chance it's just gonna go up or down even just 1-2k% from here and stay around that point for years to come - it's either bound to exit this galaxy or shoot down to shyte.

@_date: 2017-11-15 07:21:46
Do people in this sub not realize that there is literally over 100 billion dollars worth of other cryptos in the market? Bitcoin, at least as it is now, is much more like a store of value or useful for very large purchases - it is not practical to use for everyday purchases, but there are multiple other cryptocurrencies very useful for such things.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:57:10

It's nothing to do with BTC, it's just how financial markets work. Even if Bitcoin should innately be valued at 100k+, it should not be happening this fast and thus a very significant pullback -will- happen.

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:08:08
The "cash out" periods tend to be around milestones (i.e. 1k, 2k, 2.5k, 5k, etc.), and usually don't affect price more than ~5% or so for a few weeks tops. I'm sure you'll see a pretty significant dip around 10k, but again - if you have faith in bitcoin and are in it for the long then I don't even know why you'd be watching it so often.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:11:22
2-3 years to get to 100k is a reasonably liberal estimate, dude.

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:04:51
Use an exchange like Gdax or Gemini, then just transfer to a wallet. Their market trading fee is .25% per transaction; so for 500 it's like a buck.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:46:56
Yes? Lol, I posted that 5 days ago and was 100% correct, went to ~5500.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:51:45
Woke up this afternoon, checked Gemini, saw I had 0 btc and all was in USD... remembered I set a sell order @ 7,925, planned on buying back in post-fork. Actually got a bit of a chub seeing my order executed basically right at the peak.

Why are you using coinbase? Use Gdax or Gemini, it's like 1/10 the fees and Gemini your transfers go through to instantly allow trading

The entirety of the cryptocurrency market shares similarities to a ponzi scheme you daft fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:17:37
Or you could be a logical and profitable investor and sell at highs and buy at lows, rather than just holding it mindlessly.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:58:48
And now what happens? A barely 2% dip? Lmfao. You're not gonna get any significant short-term returns with 300 dollars dude. That amount of money is to buy some BTC and close your eyes for the awhile.
Seriously, if you think you're "too late to the party" then just get out - that literally makes no sense whatsoever.

Yeah, a market worth more than the sum of all money on the entire planet is a scam. Definitely. Forsure.
The derivatives market's cap is a number so fucking huge it sounds like a 4-year old made it up.

A setup to make money? Wtf are you talking about? Bitcoin just as easily could have crashed 25%+ upon this news.

God damn the bitcoin community can be hypocritical and stubborn as fuck. The market will determine its own price, based on prevailing sentiment and perspective of those investing in and using bitcoin. And guess fucking what? Not everyone has a bachelor's in computer science or finances, and so these "analyst" ratings and shit will influence its price; and it literally is not a bad thing or a good thing -just a part of how markets work.

Markets are able to account for future events and factor that into its current price. It's similar to how you can see a stock drop drastically after an earnings report even if the company beat out estimates by magnitudes.

So clearly you don't? Part of trading is realizing your gains. You sound absolutely fucking retarded - you say you "know how to trade" then in the very next sentence completely contradict yourself.
