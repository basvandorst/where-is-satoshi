That subreddit has a lot of potential! Thanks for the link, buddy

Yes! That was it! Mr. Hands!!!!
And yeah, you are better off not watching that video. Unless someone pays you to watch it. And i mean pays you ALOT. Otherwise, not worth the trauma.

Yes! Mr. Hands! 
Was it a horse only brothel, or was it also an animal brothel? I remember it being the latter, but you know, the Mandela effect.
Is the documentary worth watching?

There is a joke in there somewhere, but I’m not clever enough to find it.
Maybe

If the episode is made post 2005, then there is a good chance it is.

Remember that odd period of time when people were recording themselves watching “2 girls 1 cup” and trying to make it through the video without barfing? My friend decided he could show me worse. And the horse video was not the only one he forced me to watch. (I got 10 bucks for not puking through the first two videos)
Anyways, about the horse video, they dumped the guys body at the hospital. Police did an investigation which led to a farm on the outskirts of Seattle where over 300 people were found to have been having sex with animals.

Did you ever watch the video of the guy getting fucked to death by a horse? That’s how I think the porno will end. Someone getting fucked to death by a horse dick. 
I’d still watch it though...
