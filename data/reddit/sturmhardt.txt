Really try to use them every now and then, because sometimes you will find that you are missing something / forgot something / something is not working as intended.

If that's the case people could easily say so. I could google it, but I wanted to have a public discussion about it. I wanted to see how people who know what they do evaluate the security from today's point of view.

You make it sound like Satoshi was a prophet who knew all and could see the future. Don't get me wrong, he is a genious, but let's not view him in a religious light, he was a person after all and even he couldn't have seen it all coming. That's why we have the developers today, who also do a really good job.

Finally someone who bothers to answer my quesion instead of putting words in my mouth, thank you.
No I DON'T know how it works, maybe I wouldn't ask how it works if I knew how it works... well nevermind, maybe now I understand what people meant when they said the bitcoin community can be full of asses sometimes.

Well if you have enough money it basically *is* free money. Just invest in the big funds and you are all set. There were only a few occasions where investing into the Dow Jones would not be a good idea, [it basically is a win throughout history]( Keep in mind that this is a logarithmic scale where the gains look much smaller than they are.
You don't need to be smart to make a good living off stocks like that if you have enough capital to begin with.

Not necessarily, we could just use an example of privatised water supply. Let's say the state water supply is "too inefficient" and "too costly", people want a free market there and the state auctions the water supply rights off to the highest bidder. We then have a for profit corporation that supplies the water to your house. You only have one pipe leading to your house so you can't choose if you want your water from that company or not. The corporation wants to make money and they can try to work more efficiently, but then they will reach a limit and they will just raise the prices. You don't have a choice, you need your water, so you pay. After that they will get cheap in terms of maintenance to save money and you will get dirty water to your house. The last years have shown that privatising water supply leads to less quality and higher prices. This is an example of a market that can't be privatised, it HAS to be regulated by the state, or what do you think?
I'm not saying a free market is bad in all circumstances, but a free market can not solve all problems, you have to regulate certain markets, or people will abuse their power. Markets should be as free as possible and as regulated as necessary.
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:31:24
Yeah, that's true... though I don't know if old people above 60 are ever going to use Bitcoin. But it's right, right now Bitcoin is far away from being as intuitive and easy to get as banking because we have lived in this system all our lives and know how stuff with fiat money works and there are people at banks to talk to and you can't screw up that easily with banks etc. But I think this can be achieved, we are just not there yet (by far).
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:59:37
Old people are not really the core adopters of Bitcoin and I don't think they matter for Bitcoin, as they don't matter for many new markets like smartphones, computers and other gadgets. Old people don't matter for highly advanced technology.
Buying Bitcoin could be easier, that's true, but it's managable.
Security is hopefully going to improve with hardware wallets in the near future, I am really looking forward to getting a Trezor myself, I hope it is released soon.
The last point.... Bitcoin is more than just a Payment system. Let's see how the next global financial crisis goes and Bitcoiners will have a good time. I would not be surprised if shit hits the fan within the next 5 years again, because the fundamental problems that caused the last crash have not really been solved. Time will tell, I hope Bitcoin evolves properly and with a little chance it is going to be something miraculous... well it already is today, but it can be so much more.

Nice, this is actually better than I would have expected.

How do they not get fucked by chargebacks?
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:36:00
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:34:34






Something doesn't add up. You invested nearly $19 000 in something on a hunch, yet you are poor enough to only "drive a $1200 car"? After your investment crashed to $2, you didn't liquidate the remains, you just "forgot", even though you still had $1400 in BTC - more than you car's worth.
After that you say you pumped another nearly $30 000 into BTC at $5.7 even though you hadn't made any gains and just pretty much lost everything. That means you must have had around $50 000 in the bank before you even started to tinker with bitcoin.
Either you just pulled that story out of your ass or you are a really crazy man.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:07:15

@_date: 2014-07-18 18:15:19
Thanks for answering, but I can't really take your arguments seriously because of this:


Are you serious? You really think this would be economically viable under any circumstances? If it even gets to that price point the price will be so crazily high it's a fucked up scenario. Maybe there will be 3 other companies who all tear up the roads and put their pipes in, right? (warning, sarcasm). The cost for everyone involved would fuck the whole deal up big time. You could as well say that the water is going to be imported from competitors in alaska so there will be no problem and it's a free market. If you don't come up with a realistic scenario for a "free market" privatised water supply I guess it won't work...at least I can't think of one where the people benefit from it. There is no magic invisible free market that solves these problems, sometimes people need to get together and do it.
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:48:29
I don't think they will integrate bitcoin directly. Facebook ist for the rather simple minded internet user (not all of them are, but many). FB really doesn't want to get into arguments why the 50$ some guy loaded into his Facbook Wallet is suddenly just 25$ worth (or the other way around). Bitcoin is not easy enough to understand for most people on FB to be a real success.

Can't the software be copied/cracked like usual software once the owner decrypts the software with his key?
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:05:07
No I'm not, let me put it this way: If a game is closed source it's not too easy to develop cheats for it. If you know 100% how it works through the source code, you can bypass security measures that you didn't even know were there before. Sure, open source software can be secure (like the BTC protocol, crypto etc) but open source doesn't necessarily mean it's secure.
Edit: Whoever downvotes me: Bring on some arguments.

Well you shouldn't have told them about MINING for god's sake, you should have told them about INVESTING in bitcoin, which is far more profitable at the moment.

The crashes and surges can also happen because people want to "ride" the bubble und just make profit with it. If I see a bubble coming I sell some BTC at high and buy in low again - that leads to a stronger crash (because I am selling when it already crashes and that makes the price drop even further). I am totally bullish on a long term and I know all the small crashes don't really matter, but I might ride the one or the other bubble to make a quick buck and I guess many other people do that too.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:13:29

Huh... okay... it doesn't really make sense to compare credit card fees to the whole sum of sales in BTC... but I am noone to judge .

There is no precision if you try to take a peek into the future 10 years from now. Nobody can tell what happens in such a long time so you only need a VERY rough estimation of what you believe what might happen. In such cases it is a good thing to use a very simple approach. Everything else would be bullshitting yourself, because there is no precision for predicting something as disruptive as bitcoin 10 years from now, no matter how many variables you put into your equation.

I store a small amount of BTC there as an online wallet and I can pay stuff directly with the withdrawal option. Or at least I could before the new boom emerged, so I'm not sure how it works right now, might be slower. You have to include the miner fee though, but I guess that goes without saying.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:48:44
Yup, incompetence is my guess too. Occam's razor, the simplest hypothesis is with the least assumptions is probably the right one.

What I don't understand about the seed phrases and electrum: 
The dictionary electrum uses to seed the wallet is known, let's say it has a few thousand words. What keeps me from trying many many combinations of words until I find a wallet that has BTC in it? That does not sound very safe to me....
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:38:50
If you have money in bitcoin that you need for rent or as security for an accident you are having too much money in bitcoin. Expect to lose it every minute, only invest what you can spare. Don't forget that Bitcoin is a high risk investment - forgetting that can destroy lifes, so don't make that mistake.

It's unbelievable how the fail of one single exchange can bring the price down on all others. I honestly don't know why people start selling when MTGox is unresponsive.

While I agree that we also have to USE the Bitcoin to increase the shop adoption rate, I don't believe everyone who speculates with Bitcoin is the devil. Actually those bubbles aren't too bad because they get the Bitcoin media attention and spread the word. Personally I try to use my BTC once in a while (just bought Steam Credit yesterday and bought a new receiver 2 weeks ago through all4btc on amazon). If people do this it's a good thing, but you can't blame anyone who just buys some BTCs and holds onto them because he uses them as long term investment. See it als the Gold of the future.
@_date: 2013-10-16 06:26:04
AFAIK they only have to pay the 1.5-2% worth of sales made through bitcoin, so when they don't sell anything through bitcoin they don't have to pay fees. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:35:16
They are not better or saver, but the impact of a DDOS is smaller if everyone deals at different exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:26:44
I am still holding. Sometimes is sell or buy 10 BTC for an arbitrary profit, but I'm holding :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:53:24
It's a real competitor to credit cards and other online payment systems, I see a huge potential there once it's widely accepted. Imagine if amazon could increase their income by 2-3% just by switching from credit cards to bitcoin (Credit Card companies take around 4% for their services). 2-3% is a lot in amazon terms. This is still not even on the horizon, but the potential is huge.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:59:41
That is why I never traded on BTCe - bacause it's in russia. I will not trade through any website/company outside the US or EU  because I know that I have at least a small chance of getting my money back through legal action there.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:34:54
Absolutely, if nobody uses them they will be worthless eventually. The best thing I can do is use some of my BTC to buy stuff and buy more BTC at the same time. That way the number of BTC stays the same and my BTC are worth even more because I am spreading the good word.

They also monitor your IP address. If you don't login from your specified "home" country for 14 days  you can't listen anymore. What I'm trying to say: Paying with Bitcoins should work, they have the restrictions in place based on your IP address.

Slow down there, I never said anything about china being better. Just that the USA are not the magic free fairytale country some believe it to be.

Hm, maybe I have a biased view on that being from Germany. Many people here carry cash between 100-200€ because you can't pay everything with plastic (especially in small shops and diners). Still nobody gets robbed, I guess it's a distribution of wealth thing. 
But don't Americans carry around $100 too? I mean stuff comes up where you still need cash sometimes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:45:52
I think many people here are in it for the long run, so exiting is not yet on the table for most of them. The fewer people have an "exit strategy", the more stable the ride, because people don't jump ship so fast.

Can I take that back?
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:41:37
That's right, but you really need that reasonable amount of money for security - and not in Bitcoins. Let's hope we will never need more than that security fund of a few thousand $ or € on a short notice. 
It's just meant as advice for the risk-taking newcomers: Don't invest money in bitcoin that you can't affort to loose.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:30:28
I don't think MTGox itself has an incentive to bring itself down. They earn money with every trade made and I think they are interested in the long term success where they can make money for the next 5-10 years.
All those other people using scare tactics really DO have an incentive: They want to buy cheap.
So don't be scared guys, keep your bitcoins and in a few days everything is going to be okay again. I don't think the price of bitcoin has reached it's peak yet.

It's not a stock, it's a currency. The difference is that you can DO stuff with it, be it legal or illegal, it opens opportunities. A stock can't do anything, it has no use.

Sure, but it's a step in the right direction. Better than the BTC just sitting in his wallet. We all need to USE the BTC more instead of hoarding it.

Please, stop it with this extremist libertarian crap. "They take not only your money in the form of taxes, they take time out of your lifetime by conscripting you to be part-time accountants, they take your freedom by forcing you to obey laws you don't believe in, they take your aspirations and dreams by regulating and licencing" 
When I read stuff like that I know that you don't know anything about life and that you are just seeing yourself. A society needs rules to live by, those rules will not be loved by EVERYONE but by most. Laws are not a bad thing a priori and some stuff has to be regulated, you can't bring a chaingun to school. You also have to get a job to make a living, that's not the governments fault. If you don't like your government, create your own party and change what you don't like - if enough people think like you. This thing is called democracy, use it or leave it.
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:53:09
Except if you dare to look over your border. There are countrys where you can see (some of) the tax money at work. Everybody here in Germany can get a decent education even if he/she is poor as hell because it's free and paid for by society. Health care - no problem as well. There are some fields where private companies just suck and make it worse for everyone because their purpose is to make a profit. These are expecially infrastructure (roads, water supply, electricity...), education, the prison system etc. In those examples the interests of the citizens (get a good quality of service for a reasonable amount of money) is opposed to the goal of private companies (get the max possible output of money with the least possible input of money from their side). In the example of fresh water supply you would get expensive water with low quality from a private company because they want to make money but don't want to invest in infrastructure. That case can be seen everywhere around the world where the water supply has been privatized.
For those sectors you need taxes and a competent government. Of course they can screw up as well, and a lot of tax money still goes to hell, but private companys are not a solution either. There is a lot wrong with what our taxes are spent on (military, banks etc...) but that does not change the fact that in their core taxes are not a bad thing and needed.

It doesn't even have to be something that drastic, even smaller things can impact the BTC a lot. For example if only a few countries ban BTC in, it would make the BTC less useful, yet not useless, thus decreasing the value. People crying for 0,0001% in a calculator making a prognosis for something happening 10 years from now have been using computers for too long, reality can not be predicted that precisely on such a scale. In other words: Whole percentages are enough.
