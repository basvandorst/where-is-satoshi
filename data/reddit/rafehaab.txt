In what world does anyone get a say on how others spend their money?
I have had a couple street pups before my latest dog, and not a single one of them showed any loyalty to us. One of them my mother had to give away because it liked to jump at the clothing on the drying rack and tear it. I was too young to train it, and she was working too much to have the time to watch the dog 24/7 for a month to teach it to stop doing that
My second dog was well trained because I was older and was now capable, but didn't have an ounce of guarding instinct. The house got mugged three times before it died from the thief getting tired of feeding it poisoned meat each time he wanted to steal from us and decided to just shoot the dog and be done.
And the third dog, a mixed labrador, just got stolen because it was too trusting and liked to destroy our fence to wander around the neighborhood.
Then we spent money on a purebreed belgian shepherd, and we got a smart, loyal watch dog that wouldn't leave us unprotected for anything in the world. Sometimes buying a purebred pup is the only way to get a blank slate where you can train in the nehaviors you want, because they have been bred for generations to be well suited for the purpouse you need them for.
By all means, adopt from a rescue if all you want is a pet to sink time in with the only reward of a bit of love. But when you need a dog to fit a specifict purpouse, your only option is to buy a pup of the right breed.
And as long as you pay for it with your own money, no one else should have a say in what kind of dog you get.

That's why I watch dumb youtube videos. When they are bored enough, they will stop spying me.
