My feelings as well when I tried to be 'that change' while working there.  At least you tried, sorry.

we've been running them since August like that.  Some of our customers have been modding their rigs with heatsinks because they overclock the H-boards.  Wattage is at 0.9 a GH.
As I stated above, ventilation is key.  The chips like to run warm, but by aiming a fan at the boards it will take care of things.
This new unit is not yet available, but our 400gh kits have been.  We are currently out of M-boards and will probably get them back in stock after the Chinese New Year, as everything grinds to a halt over there.

thanks, i was looking for a link like this

agreed - we all know at this point that any USB miner will not generate a steady ROI with the rising difficulty as of late.  The USBs are more aimed at hobby miners who are just testing the waters.

I order Papa Johns via Gyft, and once the driver told me that I had a 'Papas Reward Card' or something like that, which means it shows up as a different type of semi-anonymous Gift Card.

You'd think that would like to have reps from mining companies helping out, but instead they get banned with no explanation.  Not cool.

Thats great! I'm happy to see the word spreading in Thailand.  Sent you a PM since i'll be there in 2 months for my honeymoon!
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:53:09
I had a couple buttheads talking about how worthless Bitcoin is.. so i sent them pizzas using Gyft.  
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:22:08
as someone who is going to Thailand for his honeymoon, this is like the best thing i've read in a while.
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:21:38
Jim was on his honeymoon as well as another member.   It's called 'having a life'.
Judging by your frequent reddit postings and sock puppetry, looks like you need to step outside and do that as well.

I love it when people say "Cali".  Only one person can say that, and only if they are returning back to said spot: LL Cool J.

anyone with half a brain would realize how much of a Ponzi scheme it is.  The numbers just don't add up.  Combine that with the extreme censorship (who hasn't been blocked by Garza on twitter yet?) and it's a blatant money grab.

Hi gang - I work with Megabigpower, if you have any questions about our products or services let me know.  We just got back from the Texas Conference and I am really excited for the future of Bitcoin!
FYI: At the time the segment was filmed, bitcoin prices were higher, and we have a European operation that is also 1PH now.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:32:36
As someone who has 2 velvet unicorn paintings, and a writeup on page 2 for MegaBigPower for our company - I am very pleased.
I saw the alt covers for this issue, and this is a better choice then unicorns pooping bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:00:56
I found a way to set up Bitfury / Megabigpower rigs up for p2pool.  You'll find it in the newly updated FAQ page here: 
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:55:08
It's not easy.  I just installed everything and nothing worked - if there were some easier step by step instructions, it would bring a ton of miners over. 
EDIT: here's a windoze step-by-step.

I worked at the Foundation, never heard of the dude.  They have Jim and Greg fulltime, with Patrick as an advisor until the shitstorm shakeup last month.   Sounds like even more smoke being blown up your ass.

Chips, M-boards and H-boards are all ours, custom made.  Customer needs to supply the PSU, rPi and SD card.  Here's my how-to guide:  
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:45:23
I worked for the Foundation for 3 months.   Those assholes let me go immediately upon returning from my honeymoon blaming me for their lack of direction. The Affiliate Director has no direction.   No one has any direction there.  It's basically like Jon flies around and everyone jumps at his whim.  
I wanted to be the change and was excited at the opportunity to help make the Foundation seem like a better group that wanted to truly make things better.  Sadly, it doesn't and it doesn't look like they will make anything better unless it gets an enema.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:53:38
They cannot answer this because they do not have any direction nor answers.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:23:52
I really enjoy the positive attitude here as well.  As a miner, is doom and gloom, with nothing positive for each post.  I even got banned for no reason after posting about our rigs when we slashed prices.  
Thank you all for the news, insights and great information here.

Our chips, H-boards and M-boards are Bitfury: all custom made.  When we have extra stock, we make it available to the public.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:29:40
haha the cold monolith BTCF downvoting machine in action.  I can see Jinyoung clenching her teeth &amp; fists while telling other employees to downvote this.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:56:39
Ventilation and power are the 2 most crucial things for mining rigs.   As long as you have a fan aimed at them, and a good PSU: you will be fine.
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:40:48
I figured out how to tweak it for chainminer on stock bitfury / megabigpower rigs:

No, he cannot continue to hide in his heavily moderated forum.

Thanks for the gold.  I feel special.  Tonight, i'm going to put on a fedora and an ugly vest, douse myself in Axe body spray and go get some suckers to join the Cult of Gawyana .
By the way, this is going to a golden scene in the upcoming "Fall and Fall of Paycoin" documentary that will probably come out after this turd gets flushed.

This needs to be put in neon lights - money talks.  
I'm sure that Garzas security and lawyers won't help him blocking Q&amp;A like he does on Twitter and in his highly moderated forum though.

Upvote if he's blocked you as well instead of answering questions.  I'm sure his blocked list is over 9000 by now.

As someone who wanted to be the change (like you) and worked there fulltime for 3 months only to get shafted, I also saw the ineptitude and lack of compassion for the technology they were supposed to represent.
