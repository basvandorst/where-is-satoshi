A futures contract is an agreement between two parties – a buyer and a seller – to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. 
Each futures contract represents a specific amount of a given security or commodity. The most widely traded commodity futures contract, for example, is crude oil, which has a contract unit of 1,000 barrels. Each futures contract of corn, on the other hand, represents 5,000 bushels – or about 127 metric tons of corn. 
Futures contracts were originally designed to allow farmers to hedge against changes in the prices of their crops between planting and when they could be harvested and brought to market. 
While producers (e.g., farmers) and end users continue to use futures to hedge against risk, investors and traders of all types use futures contracts for the purpose of speculation – to profit by betting on the direction the asset will move.

I want to invest in Australian beer now after learning that the demand for it can move a $178B currency market down -6.7% in 24H.

I'm sure they will consider it as seriously as they've considered Brexit, sending the U.K. currency tumbling on the prospect of years of uncertainty about how the endeavour will work.

Absolutely not.

Yeah, fugazi, fogazi. It’s a wazi, it’s a woozi. It’s…fairy dust. It doesn’t exist, it’s never landed, it is no matter, it’s not on the elemental charge. It’s not fucking real.

Weak hands who have invested more than they can [psychologically handle]( and probably even more than they can afford to lose, will *always* lose.
It's only natural.

I wish I could buy $400k worth of something and forget about it.

That will only happen once there wouldn't be a need to refer back to fiat currency to know the value of what you have.

It's called manipulation. You won't find someone talking about a subject on National TV for no reason.

Cryptocurrency is currently **completely** **unregulated** **in** **Ukraine**. 
Literally not a single piece of legislation. Even if you want to pay taxes on it you *can't* because there isn't even a category for cryptocurrency to fall under (it's not categorized as an asset, it's not a security, not property, nothing). 
So it's basically a legitimate way for them to launder money.

These discussions are basically the blind leading the blind. Don't look for advice here, it's all speculation.
