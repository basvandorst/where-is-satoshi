there is a much higher chance BTC goes to 0 than the US dollar.

what do you mean by this?
If the coin is 100% backed by the US government that's all that matters, right? 
I'm sure there are benefits to it being out of centralized control, just 99.9% of people I would bet do not care about these benefits. They would prefer safety and ease of use. I'm looking at this from the perspective of widespread adoption.

i'm speaking from the perspective of widespread adoption.
99.9% of the general public will agree with my statement. Keeping your money in USD is MUCH safer than bitcoin. 
Also bitcoin and other crypto are heavily subject to price manipulation. decentralized doesn't mean the price isn't controlled by a handful of people.

USD is MUCH safer than BTC. Also, inflation is necessary and good for the economy.

me response:
Such a coin is certainly possible. If more people use crypto for everyday transactions I think it's very likely.

i changed it to *theoretical usd backed currency.
what if the us government made a usd backed cryptocurrency that was 100% guaranteed?
my point is that a 100% backed crypto is inevitable (IMO). why is btc better?

fair enough. 99.9% of people do not care about this though. They want convenience and safety. I'm looking at this from the perspective of widespread adoption. 
(Ignoring illegal stuff) I'm ignorant on in what scenario this is beneficial, except in the one in a million chance the government collapses or something.
