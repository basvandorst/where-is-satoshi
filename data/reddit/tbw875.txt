Sure, but at $116k per transaction? And following it back a half hour in history and it's lost 20btc.

Thanks for the explanation. I think I follow. You're saying if I want to send 0.1BTC to a friend, I have to send all of my Bitcoin in a transaction, one of which is a new wallet of mine, another is the actual recipient?
This makes sense for one transaction. But what about for hundreds like this bot is performing? I just don't see the benefit to multiple consecutive transactions, always giving a little to the miners, and only clogging up the block.

But Bitcoin *is* a tradeable asset. It's simple supply and demand. Sure the whole idea that you should trade into btc and then just use btc for regular purchases is all well and good, but not realistic at this stage. 
For someone wanting to maximize the outcome of his day job's paycheck, this is a promising short term investment, and even a good (however volatile) long term investment. But should watch the market closely and have a strategy for a quick exit. Oh, and don't pour in your life's savings.

How do you actually pay the tax?
