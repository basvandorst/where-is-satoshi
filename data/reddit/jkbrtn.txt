Cool thanks

Do you not understand buy low sell high? I mean that’s not just BTC that’s about making a profit on selling anything.  Sell BTC for more than you paid.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:59:37
Seems OP is going to be perpetually broke.
@_date: 2019-07-22 05:30:18
No that’s a housing ghetto. We’re talking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:30:47
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:58:41
Seems you’re the dumb one.  Your question was not phrased in a way for you to get the answer you wanted. Take a lap.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:26:25
Pretty  dope actually
@_date: 2019-07-22 02:00:14
You sound like a psycho. Get help. Who gives a fuck about Iran.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:03:03
I apologize. Ok let me answer the question then.
“Sell BTC for more than you paid.”
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:21:51
Crazy that a dude that is so smart could give such a dumb  and uneducated answer.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:20:50
This does not answer OPs question though. He wanted to know how to sell BTC for profit. You directed him how to sell BTC. Please don’t confuse OP.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:00:32
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:19:13
No surprise looks like OP is falling for a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:59:04
That’s awesome, cool item for first purchase. I really like the stone selection. Congratulations, hopefully you can pass that down along with btc to your children.��
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:27:17
Is there a link to this or anything?
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:01:10
I remember having to use Dwolla
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:53:08
I fully expect the real bull run not to start util creditors are paid back. Lots of people will liquidate I imagine right away 
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:11:42
Bummer, has  this been implemented yet?
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:47:34
Switch banks fam....fuck em. I only use credit unions.
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:33:39
Take it up with the bitcoin council 
@_date: 2019-11-02 03:26:54
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:24:24
Isn’t local bitcoins a thing?
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:22:29
Used BMW X5. “Murdered out” 
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:55:18
Hopefully 1-2 BTC....I plan on paying for it too in BTC but I don’t need three engines.  I just ordered the dual engine AWD.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:53:14
Bitcoin is as much a “brand” as gold is
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:14:46
join a credit union and dont ask....problem solved
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:20:34
a bajillion dollars
@_date: 2019-08-18 04:45:40
Wow, is that even possible. How many bitcoins is that? That should be tracked on the blockchain
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:08:30
Ok you drive a hard bargain.  We split 70/30 you. Deal?
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:55:21
When do the BTC prices update?  Is this once a day and at what time?  Seems the calculator has listed BTC as 9300 USD for a while
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:53:24
Let’s split the findings. 60/40 you I think is fair.
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:51:35
No of course, not nitwit.. is every non-violent criminal locked up for consecutive life sentences. use your brain and understand the distinction.  
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:39:28
And it will take 6 Satoshis  to buy an apple
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:33:09
Looks interesting..nice 
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:13:35
ahhh got it thank you. Makes sense as to why it seemed the timing of the updates fluctuated .
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:55:59
I would delete this thread.  Someone at coinbase if they haven’t already will read and be on the look out. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:45:30
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:53:45
Again a little confused here. Wasn’t all parties involved actually federal agents pretending to be SR drug dealers that were making up a story that they were going to dox users of SR. And the “hitman” was also federal agent? Were these charges not dropped? I’m confused here . Thanks for clarifying. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:31:53
1. I’m confused, why was he trying hire to hit men?  Wasn’t it because someone was pretending they were going to dox SR users and the “hitmen” were federal agents?
2. I’m confused, I thought no one was killed and the charges were dropped?
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:47:50
I’m confused. didn’t the guy “he ordered A hit own” threaten to dox users of Silk Road?
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:55:15
I’m a little confused here and maybe I’m misunderstanding what the words mean, but why is he a psychopath and why is he murderous? 
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:56:33
There won’t if you don’t touch it 
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:07:48
“My thread”.... to read later
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:36:39
I care.
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:23:35
Thanks for the heads up didn’t see it on the app at the top right....and did people really downvote me?....lol get a life 
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:42:29
I’m sure some people don’t want to get audited. The article states many people did not file for gains the year before so I’m guessing the same people don’t want to file their loses if they didn’t file for their gains..
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:08:14
Meaning I can look at my activity and find this post more easily 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:19:58
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:25:16
My thread so I can refer to it later...didn’t see the save button at the top right of the app 
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:24:08
I intend to!! Will definitely drop a review thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-18 00:24:53
Nothing like a dirty pressie 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:34:44
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:43:41
you should buy pack in and call it a day
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:54:02
The second part  of your comment is not related to giving btc as a gift. Paper wallets are excellent  for that. That's my point.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:09:12
Where is this?
@_date: 2019-05-05 02:46:54
I don’t care for Milo I think he is a loud mouth slug troll buffoon .  I dislike Coinbase more.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:45:00
Meh...paper wallets definitely serve a purpose. Very easy to put in a card and give as a gift. People love getting bitcoin. It’s a unique cool gift.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:08:06
What’s the difference between that and a CC its literally the same concept? The credit card company as a third party pays the vendor in cash and you pay the CC company. Bitpay as a third party pays the vendor in cash and you pay Bitpay. No large company will ever allow bitcoin as a form of payment when BTC volatility is high.  Your post was pointless, rambling and the use of bold text was rather annoying.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:51:49
Does anyone they have an invite code the could please DM me?  Thank you in advance!
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:08:54
To clarify, I agree that Milo should 100
percent be allowed a coinbase account. I don’t support censorship.
