sure, but that's not really the point of us sponsoring a fighter.  We're not trying to make an established fighter richer.  This is more about trying to help out a struggling newcomer or an up and comer by providing a bit of financial assistance in exchange for some exposure for our community.

You're not going to see headlines like that.  This isn't the 90s anymore when the UFC was seen as a barbaric blood sport.  The sport is widley accepted today and has grown significantly.  John McCain famously led a campaign to ban the UFC back in the 90s calling it "human cockfighting".  But even he has changed his mind since then, claiming to have watched the last Lightheavy weight championship fight between Jon Jones and Glover Teixeira.  
The fact is, UFC makes a great choice due to the strong internet presence of the media, the fans and the various communities that support MMA.  It has a fairly strong global presece as well compared to a lot of other sports that are either only big in the US or just big in Eruope.   
As for Joe Lauzon, he's really the best person for the job as well.  The guy is a super exciting fighter in the light weight division, he's a huge redditor, and is big into the whole nerd/tech scene.  I think he even graduated with a computer science degree so I'm sure he's very familiar and can talk about Bitcoin quite knowledgably.

which episodes did he have bitcoin ppl on?  And who were they?
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:41:02
Yeah Lauzon seems like the best choice here.  He's a big redditor as well which is a plus.  Exciting to watch, but the only thing is he's probably not the kind of fighter who needs financial support.  The dude gets tons of fight of the night awards.

How do you expect volentary trade and donations to even match 1/100th of the money generated through taxes?  I don't really see that as a realistic option nor does it address equal input towards societal needs by all its citizens.

The Correction we've all been waiting for.  Time to buy up all the cheap coins boys and girls.

It wasn't meant to come across that way.  I'm not looking to temporarily boost the value of bitcoin, but rather increase awareness through his popular podcast.

You're overeacting quite a bit.  There's no need for a lawyer when they've already stated that checks are in the mail.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:10:01
well if you were to base it off current trends, we should be hitting $400 in a bout a week.  ;)

canadian exchanges are below 100.  that's already telling you a lot since Canada prices tends to be higher than the States.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:10:40
wow.  Has their volume increased at all though?  I barely see any trades on there.

He is aware of SR.  He's talked about it on the podcast.  This is incidentally actualy how I first learned about bitcoin.

well so much for this subreddit.

I just want to point out that a correction may not necessarily mean a drop in price as everyone is stating.  It could imply that an asset is undervalued (due to a massive sell off for example) and the price becomes much lower than it should be.  In this example, the price correction is upwards.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:49:05
It has Crashed.  It's already below 100 now.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:45:45
Strange, I was curious about this myself and I was reading on r/bitcoinmarkets that in Canada, it's actually treated as fully taxable income.  People were claiming that many Canadians don't realize this and will be filling their taxes incorrectly.  Not really sure who to trust now.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:10:51
yeah but this sort of lag is very uncharacteristic.  Even the new canadian exchange Vault of Satoshi is way ahead of Virtex and I can't see how they would deal in more volume seeing as how they're pretty new.  
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:12:16
This might sound like a really idiotic question, but could somebody not manipulate prices on an exchange by seemingly buying and selling bitcoins through 2 different accounts?  So one account would sell the bitcoins at a slightly higher price than the current market value and the second account would buy up those coins by setting the price to the same value?  
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:15:10
Yes its rising fast, but we've beeen here before 6 months ago when it recahed ite highest peak.  How can this be another "bubble" when the price is merely recovering back to what it was earlier in the year when the last so called "bubble" popped.  
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:00:04
I get your excitement, but its still good to be somewhat cautious about these things.  Not everything that showed good potential in the beginning made into the mainstream fold like the examples you pointed out.  In fact, many have failed.  
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:11:58
yes this is an issue at the moment, but it won't be once the price stabilizes.  And it will once it becomes a mainsream thing.  These are all problems that any currency will face during its initial stages of adoption.  Bitcoin obviously has a highly ambitious goal of being a global digital currency and thus these price fluctuations are pretty much inevitable until it reaches that goal.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:43:10
actually, what you described is very much a bubble in my opinion.  Panic selling due to these factors you descirbed is indicitive of the general public not having complete confidence in bitcoin's value.  And a drop of that magnitude in price pretty much shows how many people were speculating on bitcoin as get rich quick type investment.  Bottom line is the price would not drop that much had it not been a bubble (or something truly damaging happened to bitcoin which effects its fundamentals values).  With that said, I personally love bitcoin and see a great future with this revolutionary currency.  But I still say at the moment, its still full of speculators.  
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:06:36
Fair enough.  But people will fixate on price regardless of having a price ticker on the side. 
As for which price, I would imagine it would be some sort of last price average taken across all the big exchanges?  And then display them in a few different currencies?
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:17:18
no offense, its completely ridiculous that you're whining about bitcoin being open to scams and theft when you're out throwing your coins away in sketchy unregulated gambling sites.  You can easily get scammed doing that with any currency, so maybe you shouldn't use bitcoin as your excuse for your poor judgement.

The precious metals are where all the real action is today.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:22:15
yes but like i said above, even smaller exchanges are not lagging to that extent.  Vault of Satoshi is already past 1100 while only dealing roughly 125 BTC volume a day.   Virtex does well over 1000 BTC a day.  Something doesn't add up.
