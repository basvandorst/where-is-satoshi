Thanks, Armory looks like it does exactly what I'd like (the offline transactions).

Do you value your time at all? As has been mentioned higher up, the amount of bitcoin you have could be purchased easily at current market prices from coinbase for $22. If it took you more than 3 hours to acquire that amount you have been working for less than US minimum wage. I can't pretend to know your location or income situation, but no doubt there are more profitable activities you could be engaging in, and then use that income to purchase bitcoin if your goal is simply to have bitcoin to play with.
Additionally, the "spammy" nature of places like bitcoinget is that they create lots of tiny transactions, which in in the best case only waste space in the blockchain that ever full node stores.In the worst case they are effectively DDoSing the network and slowing the propagation of other transactions.

Just to make sure you are aware, the flash backups are only guaranteed to be refreshed if you move/copy the data onto the microsd card again. Simply checking if the data is still readable is not going to refresh it. Also, if you are going to check it, you might as well copy it over to a new storage device instead of just checking it.

I got this a few hours ago, sent to an email address of mine found in the 2011 mtgox leak.
The "password.txt" file is ~450kb and begins with a header for a win32 executable. Yeah, nooo.
OP, I'd recommend taking out the link to the infected files to prevent curious people from accidentally screwing themselves.

Can you expand on what could go wrong? 
I have a significant number of coins in the existing wallet, and I'd rather not make them live if I don't absolutely have to. 
In my wallet I have several large value addresses, and then a few small test addresses I can use to confirm the conversion succeeded before destroying the originals.

The first point is easily solved with the same method I used for the original paper wallet creation: Running on a system with no storage and no internet access.
For the second point, I do plan to destroy the originals as soon as I confirm success of the conversion.
For the third point, the benefit I see is that the coins would never be "exposed" on my internet connected machine.
Of course, this wouldn't matter if I could create the transaction offline and import into my internet connected system. Is this possible?

Just return them to the same address, the owner will see the transaction and know they need to move the coins and change the password. Of course, you probably already know this and have no intention of returning them.

Same, there are only 2 bitcoin related places my email has appeared. 1. Coinbase 2. The 2011 mtgox email leak. I have never signed up for any mailing lists.

Your math is off. Using an LTC price of 3.80 USD, 100 LTC = 380USD. If fees are 0.72 USD, that is 0.18%, not 0.0006%.
I just moved 0.5BTC for $0.37 and it made it in the first block, so my fees with BTC were 0.06%.
According to this math, **BTC is 3x cheaper than LTC**.

I think you are confusing terminology in your question, which has caused everyone to get really defensive. 'Cracking' a SHA256 hash means that you would be able to create your own transactions moving anyone's bitcoins around, and the entire system would be broken, this is what everyone is defending as impossible. 'Mining' or 'solving' a block is very different, this is what occurs on average every 10 minutes. The average of 10 minutes is hard-coded into the protocol.
When you solve a block, you broadcast your solution to the network, and if you were the first to solve it, it gets added to the blockchain, and then everyone starts working on solving the next block. The difficulty of this problem is intentionally set many many orders of magnitude easier than 'cracking' a SHA256 hash, and is automatically adjusted every 2048 blocks to maintain an average time of 10 minutes per block. [Here's a plot showing the history of the network hashing power and the difficulty adjustments.](
When you say 'just mine with powerful computers and influence the amount of blocks', you are basically describing what it would take to perform a [51% attack]( which is a theoretical risk that if a single attacker (or colluding group of attackers) has 51% of the total computing power in the network, then they become a 'gatekeeper' and can control which transactions are valid, and which are rejected, but still can't spend other people's coins. Due to some technical reasons, the exact number to carry out an effective attack is not exactly 51%, but that's not really important here. The biggest roadblock to performing a 51% attack is the massive cost compared to the minimal harm it would do. Current mining hardware is highly specialized, so much so that the [most powerful general-purpose super computer in the world]( could start mining bitcoin and they would only make up approximately 0.001% of the network power (assuming a rough approximation that a machine capable of of 3500flops/sec could calculate 1 hash per second with it's integer hardware). This means the only realistic attack would require the attacker to buy up more than half of the specialized bitcoin mining hardware in existence.
