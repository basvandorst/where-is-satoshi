Thanks mate.
So as of now one should just export private keys and then after if fork ever happens then there would be enough support/tutorials from community itself to claim out free coins.
Also as you have pointed out for BCH, at that time Exodus has provided functionality to get free BCH by just providing BCH wallet so same could happen and exodus may provide such support for upcoming forked coin.
Let's hope for the best.

First of all thanks for answer but that second part of your answer has blown away my mind.
Honestly I did not get anything from second paragraph. It would be great help if you can explain that with the example.
Like I have 1 BTC in my exodus and I have my private keys printed on paper before hard fork takes place. Now suppose I have trusted wallet [say Bitcoin Gold Wallet] of that newly introduced currency. Next, what to do ?

So from your reply I can filter out some data and I can say :
First step : Move to paper wallet before fork.
More question on it :
1) How ? [May be through exporting your private key on paper]
2) Why ? [I don't know, literally]
3) What could be the next steps ?

Yes. Hope to get best answer as this is critical for all BTC holders. You never know what will you miss by not storing your private key and not using it properly. Who knows you may get lots of free coins if you follow proper steps and you may loss at the same time if you do not follow.

Yes, that's why I mentioned Exodus as it gives option to export my private keys. But then what ? What are the next steps ? I have my private keys, then what to do ? That is the question. How to claim free coins from hard fork ?
