Um, prior to 1775 we did have municipal governments... We predicated much of our legal system on the common law precedents of england....

Capitalism doesn't look out for society... It seeks to commodify everything, from the environment to humans....

Cultural anthropology, sociology and history have shown us that societies are actually most peaceful internally when the external conditions are harsh and thus we need strong cooperative efforts to eek out a survival.

Who are you fooling? Work is worth the value that the labor produces.
 Exploitation is paying someone LESS than the value they produced so your lazy ass can pocket what you didnt create. 
If you support a system (which conservatives do) that encourages paying masses of people below subsistance level so that a few people can make obscene profit than you most certainly do NOT give a flying shit about the integrity of your fellow beings.

Funny thing is this fantasy was described by Marx, it's communism... It never fails to amaze me how self styled anarcho capitalists think communism is statism when Marx theorized the eventual abolition of state. Goes to show they fail to read whom they heavily criticize and inadvertantly have much more in common with than they realize.

Anything to dissuade ourselves from falling into the deep introspection regarding our own meaningless mortality....
