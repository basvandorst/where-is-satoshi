It's a lump of metal that speculators attach value to. I understand that it being a physical object might make you more comfortable with it, but that has little impact on it's value over time.

Gold does indeed have many uses, but the amount needed for those uses is negligible compared to what's sitting unused in various bank vaults and bunkers.

The *liquid* supply, as in how much is available to purchase. If a bunch of institutional investors start purchasing large quantities of BTC, and especially if they are keeping them off of the exchanges, there's going to be a lot less available to buy and the price goes up.

Whitehouse can certainly influence legislation though (and the president does, in fact, submit a legislative agenda). It's unlikely Congress will bother legislating something they know the president won't sign unless a) they have the numbers to push it through a veto or b) they're trying to save face with their electorate
Edit: And it should also be noted that regulation doesn't necessarily require an act of congress or even an executive order

You're still reducing the supply, and thus increasing the demand.

It doesn't matter how many novel methods of exchange there are, there's still a fixed number of coins in supply at any given time. The fewer that are available to match the demand, price goes up.

Because they'd be buying a lot.

What part of supply and demand don't you get?
