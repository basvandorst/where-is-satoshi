You are right, it's impossible, that is why there is no tax on bitcoin, only on the money and objects you acquire with bitcoin.

There is a lot of cult like "if people just understood bitcoin they would love it!" but lots of people DO understand bitcoin and don't. It's not exactly a thing that is solving problems most people have and is just a vastly worse version of the money systems they use now, and the ideological side isn't exactly appealing to mainstream.

Bitcoin doesn't actually solve it. Not in a mathematical sense, and it's not the first thing to solve it in a practical sense.

It's part of the scam nature of bitcoin, start you out able to get bitcoin 'for free' then transition to a model you have to pay to get more. Mostly meaning pay the people that got them for free.

Unless it was mandatory all that would happen is the exchanges that used it would cost more to use, the ones that didn't would be cheaper and the majority of oh so smart captains of industry would think they were being so clever using the cheap ones and would forever be losing their money. 
Like right now, there is no regulation or anything, but look who people are using mostly: a weird anonymous exchange run by secret Bulgarian mobsters who run a shell company in england or something because it's the cheapest one.

Hiding your public address isn't about coins being stolen, you want to only ever use a public address once because the more times you use it  the more public transactions you have, and basically anyone could get really serious into tracking things you do. But generally public addresses are safe in that you won't get robbed. 
More you want to just have a secret wallet no one knows about, so you want a secret wallet you made in linux, put your money in, wrote down the public key (printed or in words or whatever) then basically never touch or look at because the more people that know it exists the worse off you are with security. Since remember that internet hackers are the big concern with bitcoin but people in real life steal too.

The giant spikes basically happened when bitcoin was pegged to cocaine and drug sales. The bitcoin drug markets have been gutted over and over and nothing has replaced them. 
People in the bitcoin community take a very superficial view of the "price" of bitcoin by taking the most recent buy price and multiplying it by all coins, and while the price has fallen there, it has fallen much more dramatically in volume. For a while when something listed a price of 650 it meant hundreds of people buying at that price, now it means just a dozen or so.

Change addresses are an inherent part of bitcoin. 
generally bitcoin presents thing like you have an account with a certain amount of coins "in" that account. But in real life there is just a big giant ledger with inputs and outputs and all your private key does is make it so if you send a transaction it will verify.  
If someone sent you 1 bitcoin and someone sent you 2 bitcoins there is no where that says "you have 3 bitcoins" except in the gui of the wallet. And if you need to spend 2.5 bitcoin it has to mash them together then send the left over somewhere else.

The weakest link in bitcoin logic is the reverse early adopter mechanics it has. 
Get in early? Like a true believer? Bitcoin took no special equipment to mine, and very little money to buy. I think bitcoins are dumb as hell but I got a few because it was literally just "run this program for a weekend" to get a bunch.

Honestly bitcoin markets are so comically bad I can't even imagine bitcoin going to zero. The death of bitcoin will be a death of volume. But since bitcoin can't go out of business or anything I thing the long term of a dead bitcoin would be a couple dummies clinging to whatever huge percentage of bitcoin they had, making meaningless trades in a way that volume is low enough that whatever remaining version of bitcoinwisdom shot up to the millions per coin but with no one actually buying in the number not meaning anything or able to be realized in any way by anyone.
The corpse of bitcoin is going to be ~100 true believers trading to each other in a fantasy that means they are rich. Because their single satoshi trades at 100 dollars each to eachother means that each bitcoin is worth billions and they have millions so they couldn't not be rich. (even if no one would cash them out)

I always feel like bitcoin people must be extremely young. There is always this weird sense that people think things like the internet and email were really widely hated underdog technologies that were championed by a few people against all odds. Despite that being a thing that never ever happened. There was like, occasional "who needs it" articles sometimes but in general the whole thing was starry eyed and hyped as the next big thing from the absolute first second possible. Within the first year of the world wide web's existence. By 1994 11 million American households had internet. People jumped on that stuff like crazy. It's not like bitcoin where 5 years in the number of bitcoin users is outnumbered by the number of people that bought tickets to smurfs 2.

Like of course it'd be really nice if bitcoin could handle small transactions, but they really just break bitcoin.

There will never be a time it's like that. It will always be in that sorting process of new places opening and the only way to know if they are frauds is to wait to see if they defraud you. Then not use them again when they do. (if you have money left).

Bitcoin is weird too, because someone that bought in at 1. They will tell you they made money. But the way bitcoin works is iffy on that. 
Like one dude that bought in at 1 dollar could sell out today and get 800 dollars profit. But not everyone could. Bitcoin only have value so long as not many people are cashing out. For any one person to have made money most people have to have chosen not to. So even if there are thousands of people that told you they made money in the 1-&gt;800 rise, on the long time scale 90% of them will never be able to realize that wealth. So did they have it at all?

And unsuccessful double spend won't show up in the block chain as anything, it will show up as a regular spend followed by some guy in a room somewhere saying 'oh, didn't work that time, don't release the malicious blockchain we made". there is simply no reason to release a competing blockchain unless you know you will succeed. If the real one stays longer than the one you made then you drop yours silently and never send it out.

But like, you know how much it's annoying when institutions dick you around over money? Imagine how damn much they would dick you around with money if regulation didn't exist. It's a road that goes both ways. Protection from market manipulations, protection from fraud, lack of protections, it all would disappear along with the regulations that bitcoiners don't like.

This is why "MYSTERIOUS CREATOR" is a thing bitcoiners love so much, you don't have any idea who satoshi is or why he created bitcoin (or why he kept like 5% of all the bitcoin that ever will exist for himself). By not having any information you get to pretend whatever you want were his motivations. I say if he didn't plan to get rich he wouldn't currently have 1 in 12 bitcoins sitting in his pocket. That is as equally valid an interpretation if we don't know anything about what he was doing.

@_date: 2014-04-08 13:34:02
People will deny it but yes. 
The idea is that "profit goes down, miners will drop out, difficulty will go down" "profit goes up, miners will join, difficulty will go up". 
But that has a HUGE flaw in the logic, if there ever is a time people drop out and the difficulty goes down there is still going to be people sitting around with their 500,000 dollars worth of equipment and those people are going to be really fucking angry at bitcoin (because they lost a whole fuck load of money). 
How do you think the combination of someone that is really mad at bitcoin will go with that being the same person that now has enough mining power turned off but still around to ruin bitcoin forever? Everyone around here is guessing "it'll go fine, satoshi's gift! free market!", I'd put money on 'it'll go exactly how that sounds like it'd go".

good news and bad news aren't the only forces working on bitcoin prices. Two things have happened:
1) lots of websites have started taking in bitcoin and immediately selling it, they don't speculate so they will buy at whatever the current price is, tiger direct doesn't care if the price went down, it'll be just as happy selling at 100 as 1000 as long as it does it fast enough the price on the website is the number of dollars they get. 
2) the price has dropped, and since it has dropped lots of people think they are being uniquely smart in saying "I won't spend or sell any now, it'll go back up" while other people say "it's going down, won't profit much if I buy now"  so the volume is in the toilet, less than it's been in ages. and with no volume all the lowball buys are going through and lowering the price bit by bit.

Not really possible, but the greater downside would be that it would make the dark side of having a large pool even more alluring. If you got up to 51% and aren't getting good rewards it makes it even easier to say "welp, might as well use this to steal a bunch of shit"

It's hard to say how wealthy the people with mega wallets really are. It's absolutely not a matter of looking at the current market price and multiplying by the number of bitcoins. 
It is very unlikely that the mtgox wallet that had the most coins could actually find any way to convert their 613,326 butcoins into 613,326,000 dollars or even 600 million dollars worth of goods. 
Big wallets are certainly worth SOMETHING, but it's pretty iffy to say how much exactly. 100 wallets hold 20% of the total bitcoins, it is very unlikely they could sell without radically altering the market prices.

Here is the thing bitcoiners don't want to talk about: There are real people that do security for a living, and if you talked to them and said 'I want to keep all my money at my house" they wouldn't go through listing a specific distro of linux to use and what kind of offline printer to make paper certificates with or whatever they'd laugh and say "what? no".
Even banks with million dollar security budgets aren't dumb enough to just take technological solutions and hope they made a security system perfect enough. They have whole layers of insurance and assurances and reserves that simply could never exist in the bitcoin protocol. If someone with a hundred thousand staff and a billion dollar budget don't think a solely technological answer to security is sane why would it EVER be a thing that works for bitcoin?

It's volatile because the structure of it is that the creator took 980,000 bitcoins then disappeared, then early people got thousands or tens of thousands of bitcoins basically for free or at negligible cost and the structure since has been for people who got it free sell it to people for money and the people that bought them bought them so they can sell them later for more money, on and on such people need to put more and more in to get less and less out and bitcoin is based on propagating this structure with some idea it's sustainable.

It's good that bitcoin is making sure to build up a huge persecution complex early, that way when the thing fails and a bunch of people lose their life savings there will be a prebuilt **THEY** caused it to fail! ready. So the same people will go in a second round. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:23:10
The reason random hackers can't bring down bitcoin with 51% attacks or DOS or whatever is you need a lot of hashing power, the argument is that it'd cost too much to buy hashing power just for a prank or the argument that anyone doing it for profit would be better off just mining legitimately. 
But if mining becomes unprofitable the miners that lost money don't disappear, they still exist and already have a huge amount of power, if bitcoin gets too low most miners will have to turn their miners off because they cost too much to run. But they aren't going to just throw their miners in the ocean and make them vanish. And so you are left with a guy that has been screwed massively by bitcoin and also holds the power to break bitcoin back.

You gotta admit that there has been a lot of technical flaws that only ended up okay because bitcoin wasn't used anywhere for anything important. Find any of the major issues bitcoin has and ask how they would have played out if businesses were relying on them.

The point is, ghash might be a saint, the best guy ever, never would abuse their position. But if they have 51% and then go down, suddenly someone with 26% will have over 51% and maybe it's not so easy to trust a small player with a sudden opportunity for mischief as it is to trust the established big guy. Especially in regards to selfish mining, where someone with 26% might rather have 100% when briefly given 50+%.

paper wallets aren't a solution either.

Well satoshi has 980,000 coins, and since you will need each coin to be worth at least a million dollars just to make it so the hard cap of 21 million coins allows enough money to encompass the world economy that will mean satoshi will have 980,000,000,000,000 dollars alone.

You are assuming they care about the long term health of bitcoin.
If you offered me a trick to net me a million bitcoins at the price that bitcoin would crash down to a dollar a coin the second I did it I'd do it without a second thought. I'm not gonna turn down a million dollars, even if it puts bitcoin in the toilet. 
Heck, give me a million bitcoins and crash the price down to one penny a bitcoin and I'll do it. What do I care? free money is free money! Sure that ruins the long term prospects of bitcoin, but that is not my responsibility! 
Free coins are great as long as the price isn't literally zero right away. It can go to zero after if it wants. especially if transaction fees mineing turns out to not be very profitable.

The fact it would take a long time makes it MORE scary, not less. 
It's the fact that hours/days/months after that all your transactions are still up in the air and could reverse at any minute is what makes bitcoin totally unusable. 
It means that if you make the wrong transaction with the wrong person that there is never ever going to be a time ever again that you actually know for sure things are okay and that at any time in the future they could just reach into your wallet and pull the coins back out.

here is what I find frustrating that people don't understand. 
Say you bought in at 75 and now you could sell out at 750. Cool, you made money. 
but how many people can do that? If 1% of bitcoiners sell at 750 they might get their money, but what if 10% or 50% or 100% wanted the 750? almost none of them could get it. It's an investment where 99% of the people couldn't get their money back if they wanted. 
Bitcoin is this weird mess, where every single person can look at their account and say 'woah, I could take a bitcoin and get 800 dollars/buy 800 dollars worth of stuff" and individually every single one is right but as a group almost everyone is wrong. 
Any one person can get the reward, on the condition that almost everyone else doesn't.

Bitcoin distributed wealth in the dumbest possible way, forget about satoshi, he at least came up with the idea.

Bitcoin can be split to 8 digits, also it can only handle 7 transactions per second, both are artificial limits based on the fact that the bitchain needs to be kept updated by everyone and if you let it grow too fast it will grow faster than anyone can download it and become unusable.
If you ask anyone about this problem you will get a lot of promises that it will be fixed "later" so for now there is hard limits on how many transactions you can make per second and how small the transactions can be. "later" this will be fixed, "somehow'.

Bitcoins are a dumb pyramid/ponzi scam, it's never meant to be a currency any more than cutco is actually about selling knives. The first bitcoiner printed a million bitcoins then disappeared, then a bunch of children and manchildren used videogame machines to print themselves hundreds of thousands of coins. And since then the scam has been to sell coins to someone else for more than you spent to get them. And no one plans to ever use them as a currency in any real way (beyond cashing out ones they got earlier at lower prices than the thing they are buying), but the conversation has to remain that they are perfect and will storm the world and that they are the money of the future because if people don't keep that idea spreading no one will be the next layer of the pyramid or want to buy bitcoins for more than the sellers bought them for and the house of cards collapses.

Because it's a brand new linux OS install that has never been online and only has known stuff installed (although the guy is asking you to install electrum so I guess it has been online some but not much and I guess that counts as good enough?) there won't be any keyloggers or viruses on there to steal your info.

There is probably a reason every single currency on earth decided on the same general range and no one really goes outside it wildly. It's almost like people decided worldwide that is the range that makes sense for a currency.

That is an extremely naive answer. Once the power is concentrated all it requires is hackers/obama/payoffs/software bugs/whatever to take over even if the pool owner doesn't have malice. 
I mean lets not gloss over the fact ghash took THREE ENTIRE DAYS to notice all their funds were being sent to an address a hacker put in instead of the correct wallet not all that long ago!  
Beyond that, ghash DID do double spends. the bitcoin community brushes that off because it was zero confirmations and because it was an unpopular gambling site. But it's pretty important! That a pool that could very well hit 51% is even playing with that stuff.

Seriously, it's the actual downside to the comical pyramid scheme shape of bitcoin distribution, when a few people have a hundred million coins and most people have a hundredth of a million of a coin it's not going to really be very hard to convince them to run the client that makes them getting more coins possible. And because the pyramid resulted in relatively few early adopters who got the big rewards and so many late adopters that never will the people in favor of a massive jacking up of the number of coins massively outnumber the guy who joined in 2009 and sat on the coins like smaug.

better yet, miners can change what they accept at their own free will, it's quite possible you could eat lunch and pay quite honestly and try and hit the minimum fee and estimate wrong and have your transaction evaporate from no fault of your own.

Which you then have to store somewhere, which has all it's own major issues on security and storage. And if you do keep that object safe you have only tackled the part of the thing where you have kept the coins safe IN LONG TERM STORAGE, and doesn't really address any other aspect of security in the other parts of bitcoin use lifecycle.

Bitcoin has 500,000 to 750,000 users. That is less people than bought a virtual boy or saw smurfs 2. Bitcoin could disappear in a blink of an eye if a real company made a real stab at fully modernizing digital money. It wouldn't even need to be a cryptocurrancy and could easily just be a thing mastercard and visa agreed on as a standard like they did with magnetic strips. 
This might shock you, but features like "no one runs it, we don't know who made it" and 'every transaction you make is public but maybe you could hide your identity through money laundering websites or transferring your whole account around after every thing you buy" isn't as appealing to normal people as it is to weird internet libertarians.

Other than weird ideological things that very few people share, and some dumb speculators who lost a lot of money and won't rebuy, it's silly to think people are going to spend 5000 dollars to buy some bitcoin that might only benefit them abstractly. 
Even the fake scarcity of bitcoin is done since there is thousands of other blockchains now. 
Furthermore the highs for 1200 was just mtgox faking trades, and hyping up a fake market with no bitcoins even in it. And even the current price is blatantly falsified on other exchanges.  
Other than some dumb belief that bitcoin must always raise in price, why WOULD the price not be dropping?

Because it's easy to convince hard core early adopters why it's a bad idea to mess with things but it's gonna be a lot harder to keep huge numbers of people from going "wait, so you mean if I run this version of the client it'll give me free bitcoins!?' and seeing why that isn't actually a good idea.

Bitcoin is widely used for tax fraud but it's not like no one has thought of "I'll pay you in pogs but the pogs are worth 1000 dollars each!" so it's not a kind of tax fraud the IRS doesn't already know how to deal with.

People take IOUs for bitcoins all the time anyway. Every time you put bitcoins into whatever bitcoin market you use you have traded your bitcoin for an iou that you can have that bitcoin back, many of them just keep bitcoins in a shared wallet instead of letting you control your own wallet.

This is what it says: "According to the Revenue Agency for the purposes of tax treatment, income from the sale of Bitcoin currency is treated as income from sale of financial assets. Taxable income and the tax base in this case is the sum of the gains realized during the year specified for each transaction, less the amount of losses realized during the year specified for each transaction. Realized gain or loss is determined by the selling price is reduced by the cost of the financial asset."

It's happened to altcoins. Bitcoin isn't magically immune. 
As for motivation the motivation is easy: Mining is often done at a loss. Which can be weathered short term, but eventually leads to a situation of creating the desire to ruin bitcoin (out of spite or out of a desire for short term gain) in the hands of people who have the means to do so.

Bitcoin is a get rich quick scam to some people and a road to some horrible libertarian hellscape for others.

It's the lack of scaleablity of bitcoin. Every single transaction needs to be transmitted to and stored forever by basically every single bitcoin user on earth.

That is absurd, there is nothing magic about small transactions that make it okay to not get confirmations. A bitcoin transaction simply has not happened at all till the first confirmation. 
I mean I can see merit in not requiring 6 confirmations for a cheap thing, but until you get one there is nothing stopping a person from reversing the transaction (because no transaction has occurred yet). Once you have one confirmation you can feel safe that only pretty advanced attacks can undo things (although blocks are orphaned constantly and you can find it back at 0 confirmations) but before you get one literally nothing is stopping the person from changing the transaction and getting something else mined into the next block.

Here is the description: "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank."
It sure seems like it thinks bitcoin is money, not some dumb penny stock.

If everyone is selfish mining who submits the chain first? Do you expect people to just mine for fun knowing they will always only get orphaned blocks? 
If the idea is that people would build up chains of 10s or 100s or 1000s of blocks and submit them knowing that luck would mean that they sometimes would be the winner then yeah, that would work, but what is bitcoin gonna do? Just go for hours between confirmation as everyone hoards blocks too scared to submit?

Bitcoin actually has a massive issue where it's open sourced but barely anyone looks at it.

Of course they want to know your bitcoin worth. Bitcoin is awful damn close to a pyramid scheme (even if you can tell me the reasons it can't be) and knowing how much personal gain you hope to get is a really important part of figuring out why you are saying these great things about how great bitcoins are and how you should totally buy bitcoin (at this higher price than I bought them at).
Like, if you put your life savings into bitcoin of course you are going to tell everyone you know they can only go up uP UP and everyone needs to invest all their money (because if they don't you've lost your life savings).

The max number of bitcoin is just a variable, they absolutely could change it. You can say "no one would ever go for that! there would be riots in the bitcoin streets" and sure that is true now, but will it always be true when bitcoin has wide adoption? 
All the captains of industry now reject that idea on principal, but when bitcoin is taken at walmart and the early adopters are a tiny fraction of the userbase are you really sure that "Hey if you run this client you get free coins" won't take off? spurred by people that don't know why that is a bad idea?

But at the end of the day you are still storing a ton of money and that isn't easy. You can do what you can to reduce certain issues but it's not gonna be easy, if you are storing 500 dollars it's okay to stop with something good enough, but if you have serious amounts of money there isn't an easy answer.  Like you can get your chances of it being stole down to 0.1% or something and probably live your whole life without anything bad happening, but geez, that still means 1 in 1000 will get screwed over and that isn't very good a solution.

Everyone's bitcoin in theory have the same price but bitcoin was distributed in a very pyramid shape. Satoshi has the most bitcoins, people that got in next have triple digits, then people had thousands, then hundreds, then single bitcoins, and maybe fractions of bitcoins. 
So basically each coin is equal, but how many coins you have is based on how early you get in instead of any sort of labor or work or skill or anything. 
now say that is exactly like a share or a stock or whatever, but shares and stocks and stuff are shares and stocks IN something. Which bitcoin is not.

Bitcoin has a field called the transaction ID. 
All the captains of industry here knew that wasn't really a transaction ID and anyone could change it but mt gox didn't and it turned out you can just mess with transaction IDs all you want even if it's not your transaction. 
Because of this it turned out mt gox wasn't really keeping records of transactions because they used the ID. And so people were having them resend coins and it was saying "oh I guess we have no record of it going through the first time" and getting away with taking double the amount of coins they were owed. 
The community has now decided that transaction ID being used as an ID of a transaction is a mistake only one company in the history of the world would ever do and have declared bitcoin perfect and mtgox to be the one and only place this effect and has put their head back into the sand. 
also at some point the developers of bitcoin claimed this wasn't even in the top ten software flaws bitcoin has and somehow that was supposed to be good news.

ECDSA signatures are randomized: each signature consists of two values (r; s): the value r is derived from an ephemeral public key kG generated using a random per-message secret k, and a signature value s that depends on k. It is essential for the security of ECDSA that signers use unpredictable and distinct values for k for every signature, since predictable or repeated values allow an adversary to eciently compute the long-term private key from one or two signature values, as explained in Section 2. In a widely known security failure, the Sony PlayStation 3 video game console used a constant value for signatures generated using their ECDSA code signing key, allowing hackers to compute the secret code signing key [15].

In bitcoin whoever has the longest blockchain has the real blockchain. 
If you have 51% of the power you can always with 100% of the time have the longest blockchain and make sure the one you like is the winner. 
A 51% attack is basically you send someone coins, buy whatever, that transaction goes into the blockchain then you say "oh hey actually I have a longer blockchain and it doesn't have that transaction in it at all!" and so the transaction disappears and all the coins you just spent come back.

Several high-profile settlements have been inked in recent years; in December 2012, HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) settled allegations that it transferred billions of dollars of illicit funds for sanctioned nations like Iran and enabled Mexican drug cartels to move money illegally with a penalty of $1.9 billion. Dutch bank ING (NYSE:ING) settled its own money laundering charges with a $619 million fine in June of 2012; Lloyds (NYSE:LYG) reached an agreement with the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the Justice Department in January 2009 to pay $350 million in fines for accepting funds from Iranian and Sudanese clients; U.S. regulators fined Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) $536 million in December 2009; and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) agreed to pay $298 million to settle charges that it accepted client payments from Cuba, Sudan, and other countries under U.S. sanctions.
As JPMorgan’s deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan’s District Attorney’s Office indicates, government agencies are increasingly bringing cases under the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to ensure a client’s money has not come from criminal activity. Originally, the Bank Secrecy Act was “a hook where the federal government could go in and go after drug dealers etc.,” as Asheesh Goel, co-chairman of the anticorruption and international risk practice at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray LLP., told the Journal, meaning that law enforcement could prosecute specific individuals or institutions that allegedly helped drug dealers or mobsters launder money. But, “now what we’re seeing is money laundering enforcement for money laundering enforcement’s sake,” Goel added.
The new focus of regulators on money laundering enforcement means banks need to understand the source of their clients money, which is both a challenge and an expense. Additional money laundering enforcement could also fundamentally change the industry. “It creates this awkward situation where instead of being more inclusive and bringing entities into the banking system where the records are available for law enforcement when they need them, banks are now saying ‘we are not going to offer these products and services,’” Rob Rowe, a vice president at the American Bankers Association, explained to the publication. “Then it goes underground or offshore, and law enforcement no longer has access to the information.” Plus, banks do not always have the ability to figure out if a client’s money is illicit or if their business is illegitimate.
Still, Raman told the Journal that the Justice Department’s goal is not to prosecute an institution each time illegally gained funds enter the financial system, but rather to identify a pattern of problematic behavior. “We’re not looking for one-offs,” she said. “We need to show a willful violation of their duties to ensure that there’s an effective compliance program in place.” If banks scrutinize customers more carefully, money laundering can be made more difficult in the United States, she added. “When I say we want the institutions to harden themselves against these threats, it’s because at the end of the day we don’t want, as a country, our U.S. dollars to be the way that criminal proceeds are flowing through and across the world,” Raman said.

Write a long ranty letter about how bitcoin should be tax free because you mistakenly thought you could get free money for some reason even though even when people make money in a way that actually benefits society they still don't get the money tax free and there was no real reason to think that some totally useless act like mining would for some weird reason be the exception and totally tax free.

From gmaxwell, bitcoin developer:
"The excuse giving for years of why consolidations of ten percent, twenty percent, or even more, in the hands of pool operators didn't effectively disprove the Bitcoin security model was that pool operators were more obligated than a typical miner to behave with the public interest at heart because the hashrate controlling miners could vote with their feet. I've never been too fond of the argument: evidence (e.g. miners voting with their feet very slowly even when a pool is clearly robbing them) suggests otherwise... But that argument doesn't even exist for GHash.io/CEX.io: the miners are captive and cannot leave. Worse, there is a moral hazard because an unknown portion of the hardware is paid for by other people (at top dollar rates too) and so if some stunt they perform debases its value... so what? Heck, perhaps it drops the market value down to nothing an cex can buy their obligations back for a song. This means that CEX.io can probably profit from an attack even if that attack ultimately fails."

It wasn't premined, since premining means mining before the coin is released,  but there was months where all the transactions of bitcoins are just stuff between the original people involved in the project, they all mined and traded and made wallets and stuff, and were doing it so early they all have huge amounts totally out of scale what people that came later did.

@_date: 2014-03-02 23:33:10
Yes. The idea is that that will only make bitcoin EVEN MORE scarce and raise the price. 
That idea is dumb as fuck because there is no central way to see what coins are lost so in the glorious future where there is only one bitcoin left and it is the entire world economy and trades in trillionth of satoshis the whole world will be at constant threat that some dude find his grandpas computer had 6000 coins on it and fuck everything up. 
Without a good way to know if coins are lost they are just another source of how bitcoin is doomed to eternally whip wildly around in price. Right now 78% of coins have never circulated, they could all be gone or they could all appear next week, and no one can ever know which while trying to price coins. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:10:58

Bitcoin is a currancy backed only by faith. There is no government, no economy, no product or object behind it. Only faith. Is it really shocking that it's gotten mired in people using the kind of words that have been used to raise faith for hundreds of years to try to scam people into valuing bitcoin more than bitcoin is actually worth? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:26:56
The price people use for "the price of bitcoin" is just taking whatever the most recent highest bid on a bitcoin was and pretending that is the price of all bitcoins. 
Yes that is idiotic, no that makes no sense. But it lets people pretend they have more than they do so you will see that sort of price almost exclusively and never any sort of other calculation. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:44:47
To be clear, bitcoin does not 'Solve" the byzantine generals problem. It provides a practical implementation of a pragmatic heuristic but that is not new at all, and bitcoin is not in any way mathematically a solution and more than any of the other many many many ways people deal with the problem in practical situations. 
It's like the 'traveling salesman problem", it's an intractable issue in computer science but at the same time is something even NES videogames have implemented solutions for.

In tax law, "realized" losses and gains refer to investment losses or profits that can be used on your taxes. A loss on stock is not realized unless you have sold the shares. If your stock shares went down $10,000 in value and you did not sell the shares by the end of the year, you do not have a loss that can be deducted. Furthermore, you cannot sell the shares to book the loss and then buy them right back. If you repurchase shares that you sold within 60 days, the transaction is called a "wash sale" and the loss will be disallowed for tax purposes.

I never get why bitcoin people paint banks freezing transactions and making you confirm as some persecution from the bank, it's a feature for the customer, not the bank. 
Like it'd be better if banks were magically perfect and only ever made you verify when something was actually wrong, but it's not a system they put in to be mean to you, most people end up really thankful for the system when someone steals their account and is about to move all their money away forever and the bank calls and says "dude, you sure?" and you say "no".  When it's not a thief and the system trips on a false positive the bank isn't angry at you, you just call and say "nah, it's real" and they say "cool" and the transaction goes.

Because bitcoin doesn't really do anything that interesting economically. 
And I mean I will get ten trillion downvotes for saying that.

Bitcoin wealth largely only exists in imaginations. Only a few could ever have cashed out, all the exchange value numbers have always meant only the value for a small number of transactions.

Bitcoin is so absurdly shitty for poor people. I mean ignoring the fact it's losing value like crazy and would devastate a person that needed the money to buy food that wasn't just a mountain dew flavored cheeto or whatever. 
But specifically bitcoin is USELESS for small amounts of money, the fees are fixed cost and absurdly high for small denominations. They might be cheaper than western union if you are sending 6000 dollars but if someone is living on a dollar a day or something and that dollar is in bitcoin? Even a microscopic amount of things bought would mail almost the whole dollar to the miners with no benefit for the poor person.

It's basically "pay people money for having money" and nothing about that system sounds good and the literal only reason anyone anywhere would support it is if they think they are going to be the rich in that system because they got in early, I can't imagine anyone thinking that was a good system.
Like you think entrenchment of wealth is bad now? Imagine how bad it'll be in a deflationary world where the rich stop even needing to do anything to get richer, and literally can just keep their money in a sock and get more a year than most people will see in their life and every year starting a business is a worse idea and will get you less of the pie.

The trouble is that you don't even evil hackers for miners to reject something. Miners pick what to include and can pick on whatever metric they like, with some pools trying some wacky stuff to get an advantage (basically: everything discuss fish does).
Basically you don't know what a miner will include until it's included. You can only say "well this is what would make sense using defaults" but who knows what could get one transaction picked over another, only the miners know and you can't know exactly what they do until they do it.

In the end, even in the worst ponzi or pyramid scheme the money goes somewhere, someone is getting rich off it. Every dollar spent on bitcoin will eventually be in someone's pocket. 
The problem is that it is a ponzi scheme. bitcoin only exists as the price is going up uP UP. A few people can cash out but if many do the whole house of cards collapses. Likewise, if the long term trend is stabilization and there is no speculator aspect left you likewise end up with a product that is sort of just an okay paypal competitor that is hard to secure and the value crashes. 
Even calling it a bubble is too generous. It's a ponzi scheme, but even in a ponzi scheme a few people that buy in early and cash out early really DO get the money.

@_date: 2014-01-02 19:30:57
Investing *IN* bitcoins and investing *WITH* bitcoins are very separate ideas. 
With a deflationary currency you can take a coin, shove it up your nose then sneeze it out a year later and have made money, and so can anyone else. In that way, investments need to have a return higher than your nose would, which on a currency this deflationary is unlikely.

You can do it with obscure script commands in a transaction to make a transaction spendable by you or the other person. Also the odds of a store understanding or checking what your script does is pretty close to zero right now so it's an easy way to steal back coins!

Walmart alone did 10 million transactions just on Black Friday. That would take 180 days for bitcoin to process. Just one store on one day. It would also take 4gb for that one day.

In the libertarian fantasy of the idea world bitcoin is this super decentralized thing, but at least currently in the real world the bitcoin foundation pays the payroll of the tiny number of people that do 3 out of 4 of the edits that get rolled into the bitcoin protocol and reference wallet and also are made up by many of the exchange heads and mining pool runners. 
Bitcoin COULD be really decentralized, but in march 2014 the bitcoin foundation has very very very broad control over bitcoin and runs it very centrally. The idea is if they messed up somehow that would change. But right now they even own the bitcoin trademark and bitcoin is basically made by and for them with only minor players outside it.

You are missing an important point in this story. Imagine mtgox steals all the coins and shuts down then the price of bitcoin recovers to exactly what it is. 
Man, if that happens, imagine how it now feels to be a so called credible exchange. To know that you can just peace out with all the bitcoin and just nothing happens and that you don't even harm the price of the bitcoin you are stealing. 
Other than some moral thing why would anyone ever run a credible exchange at all? I mean at best you are playing a game where you need exactly one exchange to still exist to be able to cash in your coins, but until the whole ecosystem has crashed down to one exchange it feels like every single exchange would be signaled by this "steal the coins, there is no downside"

Early on you could get in basically for free, no special equipment needed. Maybe a slightly gamerish system if you wanted an advantage. You could download the blockchain and store it on slow internet and a small hard disk. 
It's got the exact opposite of the curve things usually take. To mine now you need absurd specialty equipment. And even just holding the blockchain requires a not insignificant section of hard disk and downloads at a rate you need broadband. 
It is basically got the curve exactly backwards. Making every aspect easiest and most appealing for early adopters and becoming more and more difficult to play with and understand as it bogs down into a mess.

What problem does that even solve? The problem with pretty much every bitcoin storage solution is that they make this horrible mistake of thinking that it's super useful if bitcoin has to be stored in a way that actually using coins is absurdly complicated.

visible and then what? Say ghash got 51% and used that to block everything and get 100%, what are miners gonna do? leave? miners are getting 100%, it's great for them, I bet people will even join the pool when they hear they are getting 100% of the block rewards. No need to even do it in secret, they can flat out announce "hey, we are getting all the rewards from now on, join in" and people would flock to it.

Bitcoin is a currency you just buy with other currency. Either directly or by having hardware. It takes no skill or creativity, if you mined early enough it didn't even take risk while getting in later takes more and more money or equiptment. It's like the exact opposite of a meritocracy.

but at the end whatever price you show on an exchange doesn't really matter. There isn't really any organization that pays out that price.You can fuck with it in any direction you want, but if someone manipulates the price it doesn't really make any sort of depth behind it, it just makes the price less accurate. It doesn't matter if the price says 1 dollar or 100 or 1000 if people don't actually want to buy/sell at that price.

It won't. Currencies don't stabilize naturally. Bitcoiners love the idea that the reasons governments have financial regulation is some conspiracy of global jews or whatever but there isn't actually any real force driving currency to stay a certain price in the natural world and you actually need people directing things to keep things stable. 
Bitcoin's whole financial plan is "print tons of money for the next few decades then don't print any ever again" and that isn't actually a plan that reacts to anything in any way and perpetually keep the money supply at odds with the market reality.

Not what the developers say, here is a quote from that gavin guy who is a major developer of bitcoin:
This is Bitcoin-101 basic tech support stuff, so I've removed it from the development discussion subforum.
If Jimmy can find you, he can send one transaction to you while sending a conflicting transaction just to major mining pools. You and your immediate peers (via you) will hear one transaction but a majority of the hashpower will hear another.  So jimmy has pretty good odds of ripping you off. Also, presuming the trade you were making with him was a fair one (one where he wouldn't mind losing the doublespend race) he doesn't have to be 100% successful, he would be happy if he only won the race some of the time.
Miners are restarted sometimes, and some miner may be (or may start to) accept later conflicting transactions if they pay a higher fee. Until a transaction is confirmed you really don't know what miners will mine.  Jimmy may have made the first transaction unattractive to the network for reasons your node doesn't understand, it's also paying so blacklisted address or it's violating some new anti-dos-attack heuristics... sometimes later transactions get confirmed instead of earlier ones.  Jimmy could also be partnering with a miner or paying one off more explicitly.
Indeed, its trivial to announce the transaction concurrently to fractions of the network so one half gets one version and another half gets another. This can give jimmy 50/50 odds even when he doesn't know where you are on the network.

It says "if you saw this transaction before don't add a second copy of it". But nodes don't see every transaction instantly and don't keep a record of old transactions that goes back infinitely long so it's only a very surface level defense.

The whole point of bitcoin was that it was supposed to be mathematically secure. It's a big change if bitcoin starts having to be just about trust. A bitcoin was supposed to be unforgeable, if the new way is that they are totally forge-able but we totally have faith in the people that could to not do it, then bitcoin basically didn't need to exist, we could have just made a system you trust companies like paypal and not worried about the whole cryptography thing.

Bitcoin works really differently under the hood from how people think it works.

I am sure a rich billionare could run the price on some exchange up to 10,000 a coin in a weekend through some at a loss buying and selling, but that doesn't magically make all the other coins actually worth that if no one is actually buiying that. Bitcoiners get too hung up on "highest price on exchange * number of coin" valuations of bitcoins, but real investing doesn't work that way. 
You could waste a bunch of money and make the price super high, but if no one is really buying at that price but you then who cares?

Why? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 15:52:34
Which part is wrong exactly? This seems totally correct. All three points:
1) Transaction time is variable and normally over ten minutes, this makes bitcoins unusable for any in person transaction that needs to happen immediately.  
2) Bitcoin can not currently scale, it has hard coded limits on transactions per second and has issues that if the limit was removed that the blockchain would grow too fast. There are proposed solutions but none of them are implemented or have time lines for when they will be. 
3) bitcoin doesn't have any sort of support line,  and there HAS been serious software flaws in the past and likely will be again,  and that is hard for businesses to deal with. Remember the times the blockchain have forked and you needed to follow bitcoin news to know about updating your clients? Remember in 2011 when they rolled back every single transaction that happened in a period of most of an entire day? This stuff was cool when bitcoin was play money buying weed, but do you think a business would accept that? Is there any reason to think that stuff that happened in the past could just never happen again? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:54:29

Bitcoin is a pyramid scam where people only make money if someone buys in later at a higher price. 
If people aren't constantly pushing 1000x returns then the scam stops bringing in people and the early adopters can no longer cash out and the whole thing falls apart. 
I think most people except the most delusional don't think it'll be worth a million in a year, but if they don't say it'll be worth a million in a year over and over and over they worry no one is going to buy their bitcoin for 600 dollars in a year and they will have lost all their foolish investment.

It has nothing to do with socialism. It has everything to do with the unsustainablity of it. Every ponzi and pyramid scheme drys up eventually when you have exhausted the number of people that you can bring in. You might have bought a bitcoin for 1000 dollars and now you need to find someone to buy it for 1001 dollars to make money, but will the person who buys it for 1001 be able to sell it for 1002? Do people really think that can simply go forever? Wishful thinking at best. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:27:15

bitcoin doesn't store amounts of bitcoins just the transactions. If someone sends you 2BTC then sends you 3BTC you never have "5BTC" stored anywhere, you have 2+3BTC. Mostly that never matters, but if you ask for 4BTC it has to make new transactions to make something that adds up to 4 and 1 and needs to send it to a new address. Paper is bad at making new addresses.

Bitcoin has very long transaction times. People talk about a transaction being safe at 0 confirmations but at times there has been 4 block orphans (and once the blockchain had a 53 block orphan chain.) It's rare, and normally the same transactions mostly go back into the nonorphaned chain, but imagine being the exchange that said "eh, it's rare" then saw all their money disappear one day.

Bitcoin is way more centralized than any other currency.
One guy made all the financial policy that can't be changed. The plan is "print shitloads of money for a few years then little bits for a hundred years then none ever again". That is a level of central control that no government on earth has ever come close to, for having that level of absolute financial policy so set on such a long time scale.  I bet even north korea can't tell you how much money they plan to print in 2120 exactly.

FUD: spread by gmaxwell, one of the major developers of bitcoin!
"This is Bitcoin-101 basic tech support stuff, so I've removed it from the development discussion subforum.
If Jimmy can find you, he can send one transaction to you while sending a conflicting transaction just to major mining pools. You and your immediate peers (via you) will hear one transaction but a majority of the hashpower will hear another.  So jimmy has pretty good odds of ripping you off. Also, presuming the trade you were making with him was a fair one (one where he wouldn't mind losing the doublespend race) he doesn't have to be 100% successful, he would be happy if he only won the race some of the time.
Miners are restarted sometimes, and some miner may be (or may start to) accept later conflicting transactions if they pay a higher fee. Until a transaction is confirmed you really don't know what miners will mine.  Jimmy may have made the first transaction unattractive to the network for reasons your node doesn't understand, it's also paying so blacklisted address or it's violating some new anti-dos-attack heuristics... sometimes later transactions get confirmed instead of earlier ones.  Jimmy could also be partnering with a miner or paying one off more explicitly.
Indeed, its trivial to announce the transaction concurrently to fractions of the network so one half gets one version and another half gets another. This can give jimmy 50/50 odds even when he doesn't know where you are on the network."

@_date: 2014-02-16 02:40:11
Basically bitcoin has artifical scarcity built in, there can only be so many coins. That way to be actually useful for lots of people the coins have to be worth a bajillion dollars each. So basically if bitcoin grows it needs to be worth absurd amounts of money or it will be useless. If bitcoins are a dollar each and 21 million people use it then I guess everyone will need to average only having a dollar.
Of course the long term is that no one will really use bitcoin, and will just adopt something more useful if the idea of crypto currancy catches on, but bitcoiners are really really really stuck on the idea that everyone is totally going to go for dealing in thousandths of bitcoins while they have thousands of bitcoins instead of doing something actually sensible like using some other cryptocurrancy when there isn't enough bitcoin to go around.

For god's sakes, one of the central forces in deciding the price of bitcoins is a website that was made to trade magic the gathering online cards. Not even magic the gathering cards! cards in the online game!

It's hilarious how everyone who has a bitcoin plans to hold it until it's worth a billion dollars without thinking "if everyone holds these and they aren't used for anything, why would this get to a billion dollars?".
Like, everyone is convinced they are the only one that thought of "just not spend this and I'll be rich" and think everyone ELSE is going to be the ones creating a real economy. When in real life no one spends them and they become less and less useful and trade volume is going down and down instead of up and up, which bodes very poorly for the future of bitcoin.

You are missing common sense. Bitcoin is a tiny speck. How does this plan even make sense. 
If china dropped the price 100 dollars then bought every single coin on every single exchange that is only a profit of a few hundred thousand dollars when the price recovers. China is the second largest economy on the planet, what use is some elaborate evil scheme to so little money?  
I mean there is like 12 million bitcoin right now, even if they bought every bitcoin that ever existed in the history of the world dropping the price then raising it back to where it was after they bought would only be a billion dollars split between all of them.

Until a confirmation comes you don't really need to do any sort of hacking or anything to make the transaction drop, just send the money twice and it'll drop one. Once you get one confirmation you need some crazy network of evil miners and malicious clients and stuff, but you can send out as many unconfirmed transactions as you want, and only one will ultimately end up being real. It's not exactly rocket surgery.

Here is the thing I don't get: how do middle and late adopters work?
Like the whole deal of bitcoin is that it gets harder to get in the later you get in. Mining was easier, prices were lower. Early adopting sounds okay, if you have 120 or so coins you have 1/1000th of all the money in the whole bitcoin world right now, that sounds appealing. 
But like, bitcoin is totally voluntary. Why would anyone later on look at the bitcoin and say "oh man, I'm bored of being middle class in real money" and then voluntarily become super poor in bitcoin world? Unless something is forcing people into bitcoin, how does it look like a good deal for anyone later on to intentionally join? Why would someone doing okay in dollars decide "I'd rather be super super super poor in bitcoins!" and spend their life savings for .00001 bitcoins, where someone else has 10,000. 
Is the idea that everything will still be magically priced in fiat even when bitcoin takes over so no one will ever price anything taking into account there are multiple billionares and trillionares?

Early on mining bitcoins was very easy, running a computer program for a day or two would get you dozens. As time goes on the amount you can get from mining decreases. So later people had to buy from the earlier people for higher prices. Then the people that bought it from the first people sold it for even higher prices. In general bitcoin is based on the idea this is going to work like that forever and you will always be able to buy it and then sell it to someone else for more, and then the person they sold it to can sell it to the next person for even more forever and ever which is a pretty dumb idea, but whateves!

Downvoted because there are charts that show exactly how many transactions are in a block right now. And sure, you can say later on in bitcoin future that number might be higher, but even that is irrelevant because in the future presumably the Hashrate will also be higher and the mining coin reward is going to be much lower, making it not clear that just "more transactions will happen later" even solves the problem.
In any case, at this moment the bitcoin network needs to basically throw 20,000 dollars into a fire every 10 minutes just to stay where it is, and that is a system that is hemorrhaging money at an absolutely astounding rate.

Bitcoin has several large known flaws, the bitcoin community will put it's head in the sand about them forever, always claiming they are no big deal and could never be exploited and then when they happen claiming that they were not a flaw in bitcoin at all but an intentional feature of bitcoin because they went unfixed so long. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:33:54
Bitcoin pretends it's magic internet money. But every dollar you made someone else had to lose. It's zero sum. As the price drops you basically start requiring people start supporting it at a loss as a charity, and bitcoin is enough of a cult that can go on for a while, but not forever. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:17:58
I mean, in this story bitcoin has taken over the world economy and displaced banks. In that version it'll be deflationary, in real life it's not that and is actually wildly inflationary, but that is generally ignored for bitcoin fantasy since it's seen as a temporary state of embarassment. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:54:09
So wait, you are saying bitcoin are worth 10 billion based on multiplying the 2014 price by the 2120 number of coins? (which STILL is less than 10 billion?)
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:18:43
A currency that changes value more than a tiny tiny percent a year pretty much ceases to be a useful currency. 
Someone could maybe argue advantages or disadvantages of 2% inflation or deflation but bitcoin's fantasy world is basically that photo of a Zimbabwe trillion dollar bill except with the one on the other side of the zeros and a period at the lead and somehow this sounds like a good thing instead of a disaster because bitcoiners seem to only think of money as a thing you put under a pillow and hold and not as part of any sort of larger economy.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:44:59
That doesn't appear to be a rocketship to the moon. Especially since the other charts of "volume of bitcoin" and "volume of dollars" are both down.

People have wasted their life savings on bitcoin, it'll take a lot to get everyone to walk away. The main point though is that if you grab enough coins that as long as the price isn't literally zero it'll be worth it for an individual that gives no fuck about bitcoin long term.

The price has stabilized because volume has gone in the toilet. Of course the price is staying the same if the number of people buying or selling bitcoins is at like 8% what it was at the peak.

It's not that it's 'unfair' that the system is bad. I'm not complaining about the 1% because it's abstractly unfair. I'm mentioning the pyramid nature of bit coin is inherently and blatantly unsustainable.  That this sort of thing isn't exactly new and always ends the same way.

Yes, a 51% attack does require 51% of the hashing power, that is the point. 
But as long as you are a little faster than everyone else combined you can ignore when blocks orphan, keep going, and eventually have the longest chain, and eventually get every single block reward.  
This is terrible far beyond the fact it means you can double spend. Because it means transactions will appear and disappear, it means no other miner will make any money and all will drop out, making the 51% zoom quickly towards 100% and it's generally just a disaster even if the 51% guys never double spend.

"One, and perhaps the only solution is for Bitcoin exchanges to agree between them to restrict the size of buy and sell orders so that tens of thousands of BTC cannot be bought or sold at one. Such limits would have to be daily limits, otherwise very large orders could simply be divided in to a number of smaller successive orders. A "per trader" limit of 1000 BTC per day seems reasonable, and more than enough for most traders who have no intention of gaming the market at the expense of everyone else. Of course it would not be effective in situations where the market is manipulated through rumours causing mass selling panic."

Greater Fool. You need to cash out before so many people cash out that it becomes impossible. It'd be cool if next year magic the gathering online exchange says each coin is worth one trillion dollars, but that is no use if you can't actually find anyone to actually buy 100 coins at that price. So if you have 100 coins you do have to hurry and spend them while you feel like you still could.

Say you start block A at noon, and finish it at 12:01. then you start working on block B. 
No one else will start working on block B until block A is finished. If you secretly finish block A and not tell anyone you get a bunch of bonus time to keep working. Then hopefully by the time someone else is done with A you are done with B and can release both at once and get twice the rewards (and be already working on block C, which everyone else would only start that second)

Bitcoin is touted as a replacement for banks because bitcoin only makes you money if some sucker comes in later and pays you more for your bitcoin than you bought it at. 
Because this is silly to assume that it could go on forever bitcoiners limit it down to assuming it will only keep growing until it's replaced literally every other financial service.

A common mistake around here is the idea that if people just knew correct information about bitcoin they would love bitcoin. 
A huge issue is that many of the largest 'advantages' of bitcoin are all things that are advantages only if you have a very niche set of values. 
There are many people that even if you explain you can be your own bank and that the money is decentralized and takes money out of the hands of governments will just say "I have never wanted to be a bank, and I don't want to smash the state even a little bit".

Here is the reason: bitcoin fails if the number of people buying into the pyramid isn't ever increasing (and/or the people in already push closer and closer to 100% converted). That sort of infinite growth sounds super unlikely so people make up fantasy of taking over the country then the world to try to formulate a situation bitcoin can keep growing and having people buy in at higher and higher prices as close to forever as possible. 
If bitcoin stops bringing in new people bitcoin crashes, so the only possible fantasy is a growth until every human on earth has traded all their money to bitcoin.

Also anyone saying ghash would never ever do anything naughty has an attention span short enough to forget they were hacked in November. So it's not even like their security is some impenetrable fortress. 
CEX.IO official statement:
In October the development of the “GHash.IO” project was transferred to the CEX.IO development team. 
The team worked hard to completely rewrite the whole GHash.IO engine, as well as perform other stability and responsiveness improvements, which you all may have noticed. 
We have also removed the 3% fee and released merged-mining alt coins to the miners.
We would like to state that CEX.IO does not have any affiliation with the double-spending attack. 
As a part of the bitcoin community we condemn such actions, which harm the bitcoin network.
We have conducted an internal investigation and can confirm, that from the 25th to  27th of September, the GHash.IO pool was mining on the address:
1MA7CKbWMyKdPkmsbnwmfeLh1hYy5A3gy8 
to which we do not have any access or connection.
However, the rewards for mined blocks on the above mentioned address were paid out from the GHash.IO wallet as per usual.
Following further investigation and server log analysis we have noticed that several private keys were imported to the GHash.IO wallet within that time period. (exact date could not be determined). This was done to conceal the missing bitcoins, since there was no direct deposit transaction.
We haven’t found any signs of the system being compromised, but we believe that the attack was made from within the former development team.
At the moment CEX.IO LTD is the lawful owner of the CEX.IO and GHash.IO projects as well as their domains. 
Our team at CEX.IO LTD. will do everything possible to prevent pool capacity manipulation in the future.
We understand the communities’ concern

They don't exist, there is no implimentation or even description of an implementation, they are a randomy idea and they will very likely never be added to bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-20 16:44:03
I think a price that wildly swings up and down makes bitcoin attractive to people that want to make some cash but kills any usefulness for being a currency that is useful as a currency. 
And when the use as currency is killed it will eventually also kill the enthusiasm and kill the rises back up after the falls.

I love that whole point of bitcoin was to have a money system that was totally mathematically secure and 100% backed by cold hard math where forgery and false transactions would be 100% totally impossible by the very rules of mathematics. 
Then not too long in this happens, someone controls enough of the network they can do whatever they want and the response is just "meh, we gotta trust them" with the idea it'd be dumb to mess up what they had. 
I mean cool, maybe that is true, but why even bother having the math part if we didn't really care about that and we just were gonna go on faith anyway?

"Speculation is the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short or medium term fluctuations in the market value of a tradable good such as a financial instrument, rather than attempting to profit from the underlying financial attributes embodied in the instrument such as capital gains, interest, or dividends. Many speculators pay little attention to the fundamental value of a security and instead focus purely on price movements. "

No one seems to have answered you so here is the answer:
You are allowed to muck around with other people's transactions after they are sent, but not change anything 'important'. This changes the hash of the transaction.
This became a big deal because it was letting people basically take money out then say "I never took any money out! no transaction exists with the hash my transaction had!" and then mt gox would check it's records and say "huh, no transaction with that hash ever existed, better resend" and the person would get the original AND the resent transaction.

Well of course like all software the authors try to write it in a way that hacking is as unlikely as possible but the answer is: 
It can happen. It HAS happened. Someone at one point created 184 billion bitcoins by figuring out an exploit for creating negative bitcoins. Another time there was an exploit that let any person spend anyone's coins from any wallet.
Every post following this will tell you that was years ago and things are better now, and yes, that exact hack was fixed, but it happened, and no one really knows if something similar could happen again. 
At best, we can say it's been been a little while since anyone has figured out a way to do anything bad. But bitcoin is software and every software has security flaws and no one knows when the next time one is discovered. Maybe never, maybe someone knows one right now just hasn't been noticed yet.

Miners get to choose what transactions are included. This is a huge fucking problem. 
Right now transactions are irrelevant, they account for less than 1% of the money a miner gets and are widely ignored, but at some point they will be all that pays for miners to mine as the block reward shrinks. But right now they throw in whatever because it doesn't matter anyway. 
This leads to a future where there is no way to know if a transaction will EVER be included at a given fee. Leaning to something worse than double spending since double spending at least requires some minor malice. At some point in the future you will just have to guess a fee to include and if you guess wrong no miner will take it and you basically get your pizza for free since the transaction will eventually cease to exist for no reason that is apparent to you.

Prices wildly fluctuate, bitcoins have changed value as much as 500 dollars a day. Buy a xbox with a bitcoin and you may have stuck the company with a payment that is worth half what it was when you bought it. 
The thing people say now is "well just hold on to the bitcoin, prices just go up uP UP!" but even if that is true holding bitcoins securely at a corporate level isn't free, not even close to free.

Everyone is just going to nag at you on the technicality you used the word "all" the bitcoins and they are going to use that as an excuse to not think about the question beyond that since it'd be impossible for any organization to mine 'all' the coins. 
But yeah, you are right, bitcoins are a fragile system and a large company could crash it all basically at will. Likewise all the early miners that have amounts of bitcoins that are totally out of scale with later adopters could cash out in a way that destroyed the value of the coins. 
Bitcoin is basically based on trust that it's okay for individuals to have the power to totally sink all bitcoins at any time on the assumption they wouldn't want to.

The best part is thinking the mixing service won't just take your 8.5 million dollars and put it in their bank account instead.

Pyramids such as bitcoin

Everyone prefers dollars to bitcoins except crazy people. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:50:12
Is there actually any actual known cases of a 'whale' actually using their bitcoin millions to actually become millionares? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:30:25
Also, with so few ways to cash out, lots of people have made much of their money only in their imagination. 
If someone suddenly acquired 1 trillion dollars of bitcoin, they would not actually be able to buy 1 trillion dollars worth of goods.

 Even captain bitcoin who hated dollars could still buy 5 billion dollars worth of stuff using bitcoins and crash the whole market. If I had a hundred billion dollars of bitcoins I'd shed no tears if I had to give bill gates 10 billion worth of bitcoins to get his house, even if it's not worth that in dollars, because who cares?

No you see inflation is the us government stealing from our fiat money! :bitcoin has like 200% inflation over like 5 hours:
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:26:51
Massive spikes and crashes in prices aren't going to help anyone move to bitcoins. It makes them absolutely stink as a currency.

"Just email this guy all the passwords you use and your bitcoin wallet, also you SSN and your bank account, it's a good idea!"

It's interesting how people could catch this and are likely going to be able to track down who it is. I guess if you want your transactions confidential or secret you should use dollar bills, not something like bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:47:09
Yeah, but they don't really work as currency when the price changes by hundreds of dollars per day. For god's sake you find people on here complaining the US dollar is useless and based on theft because it has single digit inflation measured yearly. Bitcoin is a currency which hits triple or quadruple levels of inflation and deflation over the course of single months.

No you see magic the gathering exchange says I have 6 million dollars! what do you mean "take it out?" That isn't an option!
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:54:13
The future of money! It's like keeping your life savings under the mattress but even easier to lose!
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:05:25
Deflation is really as bad for a currency as inflation is. Deflation seems fun because it feels like making money in the short term but long term it's a road to death for something being a currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:23:28
Yes, to several decimal places?

Bitcoin: because keeping money in a government insured bank is risky and you should trust in keeping all your money on an SD card stuck in a raspberry pi someone sold you. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:31:03
bitcoin people: continuously the most gullible people on earth. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:15:59
So wait, are you a spokesman for the website? because I thought you were just some guy who just happened to tell us how great this website you send all your bitcoin wallets to was? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:41:26
I like talking about holding, it's like bitcoin people have quit entirely talking about bitcoin being a currency, now it's JUST an investment. But without value as a currency what sort of investment is it other than a pyramid scam? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:40:28
Giving people wallets like this is idiotic as hell and I think it's hilarious bitcoiners have taken to it as a reasonable way to pass money to people. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:56:22
The currency of the future isn't tied to silly concept like "having a consistent value".
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:07:19
There are no known cases of bitcoins making anyone rich. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:17:23
It's funny that bitcoin is totally being abandoned as a currency, I guess it's a commodity now?  But backed by nothing and not useful for anything it's more a ponzi scam. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:30:43
I bet someone could too, but that isn't very scaleable. A person could probably cash out $50,000, I bet two people could, maybe even ten. But could 100? could 1000? Could 50 people cash out a million dollars? Probably not. 
You can pretty reliably get a sandwich with bitcoins, mostly, but the more and more money you are talking the less reliable actually buying or cashing out becomes. There is a lot of bitcoin millionares that have no actual plausible way to become actual millionares based on that. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:07:15
You don't. A huge part of why bitcoins are rose so much in value is that there isn't an organized way to get money back out of the system so it's easy to get huge numbers in your account that don't mean anything outside of the account and that makes people trade for hundreds of thousands of monopoly dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:59:38
That is the exact problem, people use them to "introduce" people into bitcoins. By introducing them to the worst imaginable use of bitcoins. 
No one anywhere should be doing it. The fact people are seeing that as the easiest way to transfer bitcoins is a horrible flaw in the system. You almost have to work to be able to think up a less secure form of money transfer. It's almost comical how bad it is at every single level.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:17:20
Oh well if the scam website says it's not a scam then it's gotta be okay!
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:01:47
something meant to be a currency shouldn't be growing 1000% in a year at all!
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:57:38
At that point why even have the bitcoins? Why not just skip that part and go all off blockchain?
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:45:39
The fact this is voted up says literally everything you need to know about the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:24:48
Bitcoin is already widely used for money laundering. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:40:04
They would do it because if you have 100 billion dollars in bitcoins you are gonna be happy dumping them even if you only get 5% of the money. There need not be any ongoing relationship with bitcoins after that. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:40:55
That bitcoins are easy to steal and not linked to anyone is a major feature of bitcoin, not a bug. It's libertarian! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:24:26
That didn't actually happen though? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:43:11
None of them actually did do that. There has been one or two news worthy cases of people buying specific high price items, but basically nope. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:58:44
I feel if I can't convince you of the fact "deflation is harmful" that you might be one of those bitcoin cultists that doesn't actually care about actual economics. up uP UP! to the moon! 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:38:30
It's hilarious that people that don't trust banks DO trust some random website that is like 8 months old and a magic card website to be the centers of finance for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:26:34
Paper wallets are the failure of bitcoins. Bitcoins are not a useable medium of exchange so people started trading private keys, the exact last thing people should ever think is a good idea.
