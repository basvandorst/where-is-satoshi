There are some misconceptions in your question. More miners != more security. If there were no miners a transaction would never get confirmed and the btc would be "stuck" in the system, that doesn't mean that the transaction could be faked or reversed. (assuming a legitimate blockchain).
Let's say you were the only person on the network and you now have 100% control. You can now write whatever nonsense you want to the blockchain but having 100% control of the network still doesn't offer you much advantage: you can't create bitcoin and you can't steal someone elses bitcoin. The worst you could do is block transactions from getting added to the legitimate blockchain or reverse some of your sent transactions.
There is no incentive for a person to attempt to DOS a pool or gather the enormous computing power it would take (at the moment) to get &gt;50% of the network. 
Edit: there is more information here [

Most people will rely on the exchange with the largest volume, that was MTGox and is now Tradehill. Keeping your money with any exchange at this point is silly until one of them can demonstrate why they are any more secure than the rest.

I think most people who use bitcoin (and actually understand it) are smart enough to not panic because one (amateurish) exchange happened to screw the pooch.
Bitcoin is the same today as it was last week. Those of us that didn't hold all our BTC @ Mt. Gox have no reason to feel that the value of BTC has changed dramatically.

Bitbills are these fucking assholes  to their credit, probably one of the first to even entertain the idea of mass producing physical bitcoins. A failed student project. Nothing more.
**Bitcoin itself and by extension paper wallets are public domain.** 
Unless you think Satoshi himself is going to try to battle that claim it'll probably stay that way. That's what's great about the patent system, if no one gives a fuck either way the patent system stays out of view.
This patent could only be a description of the particular method to achieve physical bitcoin. It would make sense to file a patent like this if only to secure your security features as part of a complete product over some competitor. 
If bitbills were crazy enough to actually attempt to enforce this patent, like some others would (oracle, aapl) then we really have to start questioning how exactly does bitcoin fit into the current legal structure? Is it speech? as in 1st amendment, protected speech, speech? If so, what does that mean for the rest of **SOFTWARE PATENTS**?
The issue is, if not bitbills today then how long until some greedy patent troll with funds enough to matter decides to "claim" bitcoin or some part of it? Does it matter if it's a big one claiming everything about bitcoin or many smaller ones arguing about how to make paper wallets? What happens to the entire legal structures around software, speech and patents especially in the case where the nom-de-plume is no where to be found to defend against said troll?
What's causing MY personal wtf is that I was pretty sure these guys were bitcoin also-rans and gave up them long ago. But now the people who couldn't update a site in like 2 years (9/1/11 was last update) all of a sudden file a patent on this failed shit? NOW is when you want to start the patent trolling? R U FKKN SRS?
1. bitbills, you have THE WORST customer service like, ever.
2. bitbills, your customer service is followed only by your legal team.
3. "So I wanted to post here to see if anyone would want to buy a few if it were to restart. If we get enough interest..." **GOOGLE ANALYTICS**.
4. Satoshi, you smug Japanese fuck, you probably saw this coming didn't you? You were a little off, Jul 4 would have been more fitting.
who the fuck are you bitbills? Thanks for the can of worms.

and *Bitcoin 2012 London: Mike Hearn* 
I'm kind of surprised these haven't been mentioned yet. How did coinbase miss this? According to Mike Hearn metered micropayments that don't bloat the blockchain are possible today.

There are several mistakes in this article but this is the funniest to me.

I like the design plus the stickers are the only holographic you can get with bitcoin on them. I use them as a main store and hand em out to people I talk to about them.
I still have a soft spot for these though
