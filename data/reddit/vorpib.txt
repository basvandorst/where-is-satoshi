So does PayPal, with lower fees and instant transactions.
People are not banking on a peer to peer payment system.

same thing, pay taxes on those gains
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:52:16
I.e. predictable 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:48
buying goods for bitcoin? same as selling 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:48
You're right
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:15:31
More coins? Higher value per coin? 
The payout for them is literally double what it was a few weeks ago. There’s a point where greed is too powerful

The company is the utility, I.e. they do something. A share is just that,  a share in the company. Dividends are largely irrelevant for this discussion.

dumbest comment of the day
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:42:41
Oh boy... 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:52:52
In a century. BTC does that in a week 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:37
not for the 2017 year
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:13
I've never seen anyone quote keeping 40% for taxes
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:59:24
More money ? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:23
Crazy talk

You can’t just throw out a number and say “prove me wrong”.

He doesn't. There's no such program. Nor is he making 3% in ANY bank account. Even in the UK the base interest rate is 0.5%. no bank is giving 3% out. 
And if OP is switching mortgages every 2 years, he's getting destroyed on fees,  booking fee, arrangement fee, etc...
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:23:26
Reasonable? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:42:55
So you ARE resetting the terms of your loan every time you switch mortgages? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:22:38
How much consensus is there right now? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:33:07
Less than 1% of all online stores 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:55:17
I say the number is 20k. Tell me why that’s not true. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:44:08
That’s a limited offer, only until April 2019 and only on balances UP TO 3000. So you’re getting 180 bonus.
On top of it you need to have 3 direct deposits to qualify. 
AND you need to deposit 750 per month. 
Edit: another mistake people make often when refinancing is that they effectively reset their terms as well. 
A friend just reset to a new 30 year loan after paying in for 5 years and was amazed at the lower payment. No shit, 5 years more payments 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:42:09
I don’t understand how that means there is consensus ? 
Ask 100 people in the street what Bitcoin is and you’ll get 99 blank looks.
Like it or not there is a LONG way to go until any crypto becomes day to day.
Step out of the echo chamber.

Don't forget the 4 hour work days, the lifestyle caught up 
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:17:24
The eledery are the ones who voted! The Greeks have benefited from their own policies for a LONG time 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:19:20
That’ll be too late

I was obviously joking, treat it like any investment and understand the risks
