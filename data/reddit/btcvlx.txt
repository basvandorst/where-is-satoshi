I said that years ago that those firms would change the landscape for the retail trader, I am not concerned at all personally as I trade a vast array of instruments but those that think the market they have come to know isn't in for big changes as well the stratgies they have always used working are in for a rude awakening

$500k is hardly an amount even worthy of suggesting liquidation -- that is why Ver is irrelevant

having summoned to be one of the first people back in the day to do that debate with Peter and a great job at it I might add I would love to hear the master that is Voorhees rise from Camp Crystal lake to debate Peter again. I do however think Peter has been around the correct people to explain bitcoin he just at some point realized he was wrong but his business(es) depend on those to buy gold as well as he went on record too hard to fast against bitcoin to back out now imo
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:00:40
The only thing to be liquidated is any remaining credibility Ver has -- guy is a cry baby that doesnt grt his way and has been wrong about everything for years, remember he was the one assuring us MtGox was solvent ..lulz

These was the opinion of BFX and it's lawyers not necessarily the CFTC


There is no way you could know this with certainty, you paid the fine for one instance of violation, that doesn't mean they wouldn't come back months later and fine you again. In fact the BitGo solution was merely an experiment at attempting to comply in a non-traditional sense, one part of me does respect that because the space itself must adapt to new digital assets like bitcoin but the part I have issue with was the reassuredness and candor that was displayed in believing the situation had been resolved which I felt was rather misleading, reminds me of when Giancarlo said that with BitGo BFX would be "unhackable" quite meme worthy

The source of that Phil Potter comment ?
Phil Potter : "We recieved so many LE requests that we wanted to take ourselves out of the process with segregated wallets"  I don't know why the video was taken down ? most likely because Phil didn't like being caught saying that but you will have to ask the WP community if there is a recording of it elsewhere : 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:57:37
this is extremely FALSE -- even accordingly to Phil the BitGo integration was on the way before they were made aware of the CFTC gathering information about their platform, in fact Phil points that the biggest reason for segregated wallets wasn't because of proof of reserves etc, it was so they could point LE to specific accounts due to all the phone calls they were getting at the time -- this is confirmed by discussions with Zane on our Hangouts about BitGo before CFTC emails ever surfaced. Now with that said BFX (and their lawyers) believed their implementation fulfilled the delivery requirement of the CFTC but is only THEIR opinion and not that of the CFTC -- the CFTC doesn't tell a company how to comply they simply say they aren't in compliance and fine them. Even though the likes of came out and said that everything was fine and they were in compliance with regs that is only their opinion and not that of the CFTC -- so it was not in fact the CFTC that forced anything upon BFX, BFX choose that themselves  
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:34:04
it seemed fairly obvious they would imo 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:39:11
Corporate structure and proxy -- makes it harder to seize assets by any one country. I wouldnt use BFX after the hack as they have gotten desperate -- better off using  if you want to trade on leverage

Margin trading reduces volatility

Ummm no left BFX 2.5 years ago once I realized they couldn't keep up dev talent wise with OKC -- all been documented for years me saying the same thing 
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:09:20
What's wrong with high leverage though ? It prevents gox-like situations because it drastically reduced the amount of capital that a trader has to keep in exchange (counter party risk)
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:55:18
for the market itself it adds liquidity and a two sided market -- it is the equivalent of just adding more players to the market -- I know it flys in the face of your intuition but you only need to look at VOL chart of bitcoin to see it has decreased over years and that with the inception of 20x-100x futures -- if that wasn't true then we would see VOL of bitcoin INCREASE and not DECREASE with the inception of those products
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:58:35
well they have to move the whole market to margin call you -- not really an issue but some people that lose love to build these conspiracy theories 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:40:26
someone bet against bitcoin with a $10million short position (most like $1mill to $500k collateral) and that was position was the largest contract holder on OKCoin -- that person just lost everything on that position

They will launch futures and then launch an ETF tethered to those futures-- I said this right after the ETF rejection due to "unregulated markets" -- there are so many CME futures that have ETFs around them now -- they are just taking a different path

well in bitcoin CP risk is just as if not more palpable -- so in order to mitigate that I would rather just hold 1/20th or less of my principle on exchange instead. Those that traded on gox lost 100% of their principle to CP risk -- thing is OKC could go down and take all my funds with it but it would still be quite managable from a risk standpoint

It is actually a disservice and dangerous to give people the impression that the economy "works like a simple machine" -- this is why central planners think they can "manage" it -- so actually this is a **terrible introduction to economics** -- in attempting to simplify it actually misleads

my bar code scans just fine for WF -- I am not sure what phone you are using as I even have screen protector and it works fine with almost no issues. I will say about 1.5-2 years there were issues that you describe but it appears the Gyft app now brightens the screen automatically so it scans better -- my guess is either you are on a really old phone or you decided not to give the app access to your brightness settings. Just my 2 cents and I use WF almost every day with the gyft app

Your post lacks a ton of context: 1) just because you are unable to make profits trading does not mean it is not possible -- trading is a profession like any other and requires 10s of thousands of hours to become proficient enough to make profits so 2) how long have you been trading ? How many hours have you put into trading ? Was BTC your first and only foray into trading ? 
Without knowing all this your post is the equivalent of "start playing football in 2015, tried out for the New England Patriots and was cut after 2 weeks with no pay, let this be a lesson to all those thinking they can play NFL football"

Have had issues where I purchased WF cards from Gyft then had them emptied before I even used them -- either Gyft is buying shady cards or someone is getting Gyft's codes -- I have gone with smaller value cards and havent had an issue

This is good stuff -- glad to hear Giancarlo is swallowing some pride and admitting some incompetence on his part on choosing bitgo -- the bigger question is what the plans are to correct this incompetence as the hack although is the biggest mis-step BitFinex has been plagued by issues surrounding their ability to actually correct problems they are well aware of

This has all been good work to dig into the actual offering and the structure that was left out  -- I am wondering has anyone looked into if any of these parent companies were newly incorporated ie post hack and such to strengthen the case that assets have been shuffled around and moved before this offering occurred ?

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe has agreed to do a hangout with the WhaleClub panel of long time bitcoin traders to talk about a variety of topics including multi-sig security in the wake of the BFX hack and their products, services and business model as a company. I welcome sourcing questions from the community to ask him on air and we will be creating a Google document beforehand of the questions so he has an idea of what we will be asking as well as outlining the structure of the Hangout.

Because this sub will always devolve into echo chamber pleb ville -- I am a trader so I just use it to gauge sentiment -- but pretending you are some oracle in "warning" people of a bubble it is just what bitcoin doed over and over again -- it is like running around saying a whore is going to have sex and then thinking your god when it happens -- no you dont realize how this is the fiber of BTC price action

If you can't stomach the historical volatility of BTC then you shouldn't be playing in the space -- also it is great for trading -- imo BTC is greatest instrument to trade for a long time of reasons but being volatile is a desirable characteristic
