Winklevii?

Use Authy! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:00:00
What makes you think it is a scam? If anybody shows interest I'd ask him/her to buy them off me from localbitcoins anyway. I'm just trying to reach more people. Not everything is a scam. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:36:04
Removing post :) 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:21:04
I hope they release a mobile app soon, that would break the back of Coinbase for good. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:04:47
Fake news mate! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:06:32
They won't accept bitcoin to do what? I mean what exactly can we buy from them for bitcoin? Nothing comes to mind. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:26:42
Can someone do an ELI5?

Enjoy the freedom!

They were behind the BCH fork from day ONE, they sell assets way above market price, ripping off buyers. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:23
If the addresses are linked to exchange wallets? Don't the wallet providers have IP info for each address, I'm sure they do; but I suppose that can obfuscated. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:42
Since the transaction can be tracked as in we can know what addresses it is being moved to, is it not possible to find out who's behind the hack? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:18
Localbitcoins as I mentioned! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:49:53
Hirschman applied this logic to consumer behaviour, so if a consumer is ditching one brand, it is plausible he can become loyal to another. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:37
 A lot has changed since I made an account on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:08
More importantly, D.Y.O.R. Localbitcoins is solid, but still do your own research and who knows you may find other alternatives as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:05
Exactly, it is valued against fiat or other commodities; if it can't be used to get either it is pretty much worthless. Theoretically, the person in question could use it to buy stuff online anonymously, but converting to fiat is nearly impossible, unless he sells this stuff in person to someone. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:49
Last I checked btc on lbc was cheaper than Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:51:55
Shit your pants and eat that, neo-liberal shit bags! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:50:01
Could it be the other way round? That shorting btc was the end game after all? Big Short movie comes to mind, wherein the people who owned housing loans were shorting them!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:37:10
No voice = bailing out wall street 
Exit = putting money in bitcoin 
Loyalty = holding
I suppose Hirschman would approve that his model is being used in this manner. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:07
That's you interpreting it that way probably because you already have a negative perception of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:46:59

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:53:11
All hail localbitcoins, peer to peer, cheaper than shitty Coinbase and segwit ready! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:26:14
Did Coinbase let him choose miner priority? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:32:32
Dude just use localbitcoin or localethereum 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:13
Yeah, I never said 'they' deleted my account, neither did I imply such a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:30:08
Individual research projects do they qualify? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:33:15
Voice and exit! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:57
Does it work for windows?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:36
Localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:28:34
Good luck with that! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:32
Their predatory attitude and tendency to centralise crypto, which goes against the core ethos of this entire ecosystem. P2P is how it should work, that's why I have always recommended exchanges such as localbitcoins.com 
EDIT:  
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:25:10
Does exodus support segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:11
No, you just go to security tab in the settings page, scroll down and click on close account, the next page asks for a confirmation and then you get an email. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:47:40
Sorry, it was a Morgan Stanley trader. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:21
All transactions can be tracked on the blockchain, can't they? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:53:34
Loyalty in the model is a dependent variable on voice. If there is NO scope for voice to be heard in the current system then people EXIT and if the cost-benefit analysis is positive in the new system then loyalty for the new system emerges. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:45
Delete account when you get your money and I don't think you can delete your account while you still got some funds in the account. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:57
I hope the guy corrected her! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:32:26
I know that, but to convert to fiat it would have to go to an account with a name, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:03
AFAIK the other guy misunderstood me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:03
There is more to it than just what you said. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:44
No, I deleted my account, I was surprised that it was so quick! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:41
BitWallet for iOS has segwit 
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:16:50
He means he read about Bitcoin in 2010, but bought at ATH last year, IIANM
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:01
WaPo is owned by Bezos, could this be his way of paving the way for Bitcoin to be accepted as a payment method at Amazon? 
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:33:18
If I am not mistaken! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:06:12
What's the context? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:42:04
Who won? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:49:46
Cool! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:03:01
I wants it!

@_date: 2017-11-18 21:15:44
Boycott COINBASE!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:09:12
Fuck Coinbase, they had released an update yesterday for the SegWit2X 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:02:56
I call *weak hands*
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:01:32
Funny I wanted to do the same thing, fortunately had my BTC in Exodus, who have disabled transactions for BTC temporarily. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:04:41
Ressentiment! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:39:03
Nothing, just take the coins out, I personally use exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:18:01
They are nothing without buyers, the same buyers and sellers they tried to push off a steep cliff onto jagged rocks! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:39:50
No such user exists 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:37:21
Wiped lol! As if that value just vanished, people cashed out and that value is circulating somewhere in the larger economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:17:46
At least they have included an update from Unocoin
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:46:51
Wait a minute! Did he sell all his BTC at 6k and 8K, why did it go unnoticed on the day of the crash? Or  am I getting it wrong? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:29:13
No clue, does CMC show Korean trading now or not? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:08:00
Don't give them hits, dry up that ad revenue 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:24:12
If enough people believe that it may turn out to be a self fulfilling prophesy 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:46:55
It only takes a match to light a fire, but also only a gust of wind to extinguish the said match. Soooooo —__(&gt;.&lt;)__—
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:50:17
The title says he sold at bottom $6k
EDIT: The article is clear though, but still that's a huge amount of BTC from a single seller to go unnoticed. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:12
Haven't Koreans started trading again? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:19
It is interesting that Inclusion of Korea markets in the price only raises the price by about 10$ 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:09:08

Can someone pull up how they had rated the derivatives and other synthetic bonds in 2008? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:02:43
Localbitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:17:46
Buy from trustworthy sources, read reviews! 
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:14:18
Shape shift to Altcoins and chill. Greed kills the goose. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:52:55
I’m not pitching vertcoin as a solution as the author of this article has. There must be other ways or other ways must be devised. Only the principle of decentralisation must be treated as gospel, everything else must adapt.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:22:08
Are you saying that what happened to Vert makes the ASIC critique of core unworthy? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:19:23
That’s what let to centralisation, when GPUs were made redundant for mining. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:57:44
All that is missing from this is a live commentary, I bet someone will soon open a live YouTube broadcast and start commenting on this and invite others and pretend to analyse the market.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:27:23
Wonder why we have Bitmain then, the centralisation of most hashing power, leaving people vulnerable to forks and mood swings of fuckers such as them. Bitcoin has become centralised and that’s what is killing it.
