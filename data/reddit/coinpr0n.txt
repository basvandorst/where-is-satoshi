Nice to see this sort of stuff. Yes, it was really hard to get into programming with Bitcoin because of lack of tutorials and resources. BitcoinJ is a good library for Java, and the documentation was improved fairly recently. You're right about JavaScript libraries being a little lacking (especially in the documentation!) but I found BitCore was fairly easy to get started with and I found the project was pretty well-documented. Also, the book 'Mastering Bitcoin' is great for familiarizing yourself with the Bitcoin reference client and all the important concepts (addresses, transactions, etc..).

Fees should paid according to the tx size, not the fullness of a block. I don't see why more people using the blockchain should make me have to pay more fees per tx. This will just lead us to ridiculously high fees like the ones we try to avoid using from the traditional financial systems.

A little. EUR fell to the USD slightly, but BTC is rising against the USD too.

Another reason why "bits" is a bad name for uBTC. Now I don't know which bits you're referring to!
