Its not pointless. 
Investing in Bitcoin is gambling. Some people are under the impression that it can only go up, which really isn't true (at least in the long term). Maybe it's gambling with great odds, but without a time machine that's just opinion. 
It's important to emphasise that Bitcoin is very volatile and may either burst or dwindle into nothing because some people have invested way more money than they can afford to lose, or will invest more than they can afford to lose if someone tells them how amazing it will be without the disclaimer of "it might just be a bubble". 
Some people invest in the stock market. Assuming you've got a very diverse portfolio, you're unlikely to lose 10% of your money over a couple of years and very unlikely to lose 30%. Long term stock market crashes bigger than a third are rare, especially since after most crashes most companies mostly recover after a while. If it's more than that then the world has bigger problems. Therefore a sensible idea is to only invest in the stock market if you would be fine only keeping 70% of that capital, whether for retirement or whatever. If you can only save 5k/year and have a 5k expense in one year's time, investing in stocks is relatively risky. 
But with Bitcoin, because we know so little about it, it's hard to say what the risks are. Is the "reasonable risk" -10% over a couple of years? -50%? If it's completely crashes it might be -95%. We just don't know. So you should only invest what you can afford to lose ALL of. 
Do not encourage people to gamble more than they can afford to lose.

Don't feel bad. One day the price will fall and stay low forever. There are people investing money they'll never make back.
