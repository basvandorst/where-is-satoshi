Oh I'm prepared to hold until the zombie apocalypse. My goal is a down payment on a house in a crazy California market, so I won't be tempted for a very long time!

I have a bunch of stuff to sell so I'll be looking for opportunities to take payment in BTC for sure!

Probably not. And from what I've been reading there should be a dip soon. But the overall trend has been a steady climb so I'm ok with the ups and downs. As long as I'm on the ride.

I thought about coming in after the fork as well. But if I keep saying "after it hits *this*" or "after the fork" I'll never buy!
I'm a noob myself, so I would look for advice from trusted sources. 
Honestly, I sought out sources that aren't necessarily Pro-crypto (Fortune, Forbes, etc.) and got a feel for the way the world looks at BTC.
The things that sealed the deal for me were Japan and Korea's level of investment despite China's withdraw. It's only a matter of time before similarly stable countries adopt crypto, IMO

I'm prepared for a drop in the near future. And if B2X fails to grab the market share, I think BTC will rise even higher and faster.

Yes, thank you for the concern. I'm keeping it as simple as possible and using the Coinbase app with a regular backup to track things.

Yeah I plan on buying a few thousand more as long as I don't lose my shirt in the short term. I'm not even going to learn to spend BTC until I can put a downpayment on a house.

I respect that. I'm gonna treat this like Mr. Bone's Wild Ride, though. I'm strapped in.

I'm not going to panic sell. I figure I'm either out $1000 completely or in for a big profit down the road. It's in dog's hands now.

That's great! What franchises were you looking at?

That’s how I’m looking at it. I live frugally and have other modest investments, including a pension I can’t touch for another 20 years. I’m not thrilled I bought at ATH but I’m happy I’m in before 10k, 20k, etc.
