Owning bitcoins isn't perfect but gives people options in crisis situations.... Holding physical euros is better atm, especially for pensioners, but holding large quantities of paper currency isn't safe, due to risk of theft and fire. I'd rather have physical cash, then have my savings locked inside a crumbling banking system....... Yes, plenty of greeks are holding physical cash....

A Greek debit card is now limited to 60 euros a day, whereas a bitcoin wallet has no limits. I don't think people should have 100% invested in bitcoin, a more appropriate solution would be a combination of: physical cash/ gold/ silver and bitcoin. Having that setup makes a big difference vs only having a Greek bank account. 
What if a family member gets sick, and you need to spend 200euro in travel costs to visit them...... How are you going to pay if your savings are stuck inside a greek bank? 
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:34:37

So is this prick withdrawing cash from his fund, and putting it under his mattress? I thought not....... What if someone has millions in the bank? Good luck withdrawing that to cash.... And you need to put that cash into a fireproof safe for insurance reasons, plus you have to notify your insurer so you're covered...... And after all that the central bankers are going to inflate your purchasing power away. I'd rather have bitcoin.

I do agree with what you said, and the story about your uncle is very inspirational. However your approach is very cold and heartless. Again, I know you mean well, and, I understand where you're coming from. 
However, sometimes people need support and guidance, just like your uncle needed support after his accident. Personally, I am autistic, and as a consequence I'm poor too. After years of struggling, I now look for inspiration in people like you Trace.  But we can't all "figure out ways of adding value to society", especially when some haven't even figured out how to survive.

You can keep a copy of the phrase at a secure location. A brain wallet doesn't mean you cant write it down. And because this is emergency money, you only need to deposit a small amount of bitcoin. If the entropy is good enough, then you're safe. In the unlikely situation you lose access to the funds, the amount lost should be tiny to your overall funds. Remember this is emergency money, not life savings.

Every market has speculators and investors, bitcoin is no different. You need to accept it. Originally I bought bitcoin because of the technology and was exited about its potential. That excitement hasn't changed, and I believe it can be incredibly successful in the long run. However I'm also excited about the price, because as bitcoin improves, the price should appreciate and reward the visionaries and founders. Bitcoin is an ecosystem and we must nurture it by making it more dollar valuable. 
When I said I would've sold bitcoin above $1000, that was me looking back in hindsight. Back at the ATH..... I found it very emotional to deal with and decided to hold and not make any decisions.

I think there is some confusion about what bitcoin is and its purpose... That is what is holding us back. Bitcoin isn't really a currency its a decentralised trust system which acts like a commodity. Once sidechains get implemented we can have currencies and other services attached to the bitcoin blockchain. Then we'll see some real growth.

I don't live in the US or China, but if my country made it illegal, I'd personally still use bitcoin, but in a more stealthy way... However, I don't think any govt will make it a crime to transact in Bitcoin. If they do, then law abiding citizens will turn into criminals over night, and history has shown that people don't suddenly stop.  
If it were banned, then large bitcoin businesses would shut down or open shop elsewhere, which would be disruptive to the ecosystem, and the market price. Adoption rates would slow amongst the law abiding folk, but criminals would continue to use it. New businesses would be setup to deal with the situation, for example smuggling, or underground mining.
In the soviet union, USD was illegal. However, many Russians hoarded USD to protect themselves against inflation etc... Just because something is illegal, doesn't mean the end.

I like Wences, I think he's a good guy. However, his advice for only investing 1% is silly. If someone had £5M a 1% stake would be £50,000 which if appreciated 4,000 times would total £200M. Which is a great ROI. However a large majority of people today have less than £1,000 in savings, and if they invested 1% it would be a pathetic £10, which would total £40,000 after a 4,000 increase. Now, £40K is nice, but not a life changing amount of money unless you move to vietnam. So, I would urge people to forget about percentages and do the maths. If people truly believe in bitcoin they need to be smart about how much they invest, today. The window of opportunity is closing fast.

Mycelium wallet seems great for everyday use and keeping a small amount of daily funds on my phone. But I would feel uncomfortable putting all my bitcoins into a single BIP39 address on a potentially compromised phone. So I'm looking for advice......... My plan was to move my funds from BIP38 wallets into a 2 different BIP39 wallets. One BIP39 for phone for daily funds, and another BIP39 for cold storage. Trezor is nice, but its another device I have to carry and look after, so, I thought about running electrum offline using tails, but it seems electrum doesn't support BIP39 (yet).
So, where does everyone keep their savings? trezor, BIP38, multiple BIP39, or single BIP39?

The ATH was just a blip in the price history, and its only important to those that bought in at the top. I don't understand why people pay much attention to the ATH....... 
If you look at the chart, you'll see the price has gone from $200 to $300, which is a 50% price increase. If you had invested $20,000 2 months ago, you'd now have $30,000. That's quite a large move, but is only the beginning.
The hype will start to build regardless of what we say, because more people are starting to realise that bitcoin is useful and is severely undervalued, and it's the only way to protect themselves from the devaluation of fiat. But anyway, the price of bitcoin has already gone through the roof at $300 considering it was worth pennies 5 years ago. However, at $300 it is really undervalued, and will go much higher. 
I just wanted people to understand that quantity is important at these prices, because in 12 months time, the price could easily be $5000 or more.

I don't have all the answers, and I'm not an expert. A future of autonomous corporations maybe a fantasy atm, but could be made a reality eventually... Will it be easy to implement and run, hell no. Ten years ago we could have said, Bitcoin is a nice idea, but it'll never be practical and it wont work.....
Bitcoin was obviously a massive step forward towards an autonomous world, and using a bit of imagination its possible that technologies like bitcoin and driverless cars could be combined to make self owning and self maintaining cars.... 
Many bridges already have tolls in place. If those tolls were replaced with computers and Bitcoin wallets, the bridge could manage itself. It could raise and lower prices based on demand. Cameras could be used to inspect the bridges for defects, and so forth. The bridge could outsource help to fix things if broken, and outsource to inspect the work was successfully completed. Contracts would be managed on a decentralised protocol. 
The whole point, would be to make things more efficient and less bureaucratic. It is possible in the future, that the richest entity in the world isn't bill gates, but an airport.

Society wouldn't fail without a state, but instead would thrive. Rules would still exist without a state, but autonomous entities would govern and uphold rules, instead of a superstate.
Most nation states are bankrupt and are already collapsing, so its up to entrepreneurs and geeks to figure out solutions..
For example, a driverless autonomous car has the incentive to make sure roads are roadworthy,because if they are not, the car may keep getting punctures. Therefore, the cars would be programmed to analyse the road, and issue contracts for road repairs. Construction companies would bid for the contract, and the car would accept the company which is the most suitable, based on distance, duration feedback and price etc. 
Driverless cars would fund the projects from wages earned from driving people about. The car would transfer bitcoin into escrow, and release funds once the car had driven over and analysed the road was fixed to a good standard.
@_date: 2015-10-01 08:09:34
Societies do not fail. They get destroyed by the state due to excessive regulation, taxes and debt. 
We already have the roads... Driverless cars could detect defects in the roads and would pay for road improvments.

@_date: 2015-10-16 18:24:58
what happens when someone shits on the floor? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:04:26
Bitcoin is useful, therefore it has value. The more people who use Bitcoin, the higher the value due to scarcity.

Totally agree. Theymos is a terrorist 
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:20:08
This is huge
@_date: 2015-11-22 03:48:14
That's my point. It'll affect everyone. No need to threaten me or you with prison, just the heads of corporations..... Hence why we need autonomous corps

I'm entitled to my opinion.

Bitcoin is beautiful
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:50:23
Again, you are making a big deal over the ATH, which was just a minor blip in the history of bitcoin. And if you don't take the quantity of your bitcoin seriously, then that's your problem. Greed is good. P.S The chinese are realising it, and from speaking to some chinese friends, they are worried...

In a world of Wikipedia, what use are encyclopedias.... Once people experience superior technology, they never go back. The banksters know this, and are panicking. Thank you Erik, for everything you do.

No you're the retard. The US dollar is a terribly flawed currency, backed by the most corrupt and debt-laden government in the history of civilisation. Now fuck off troll.

That doesn't mean Europeans now like each other. Spanish hate French, Greeks hate Germans, French hate everyone. Expect another European war.

@_date: 2015-10-28 20:45:52
it woudln't surprise me if bitcoin is trading at $8000 before jan 1st. And yeah, I know how unbelievable that sounds, but bitcoin has gone ridiculously parabolic before.

I think its a fantastic idea.
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:52:59
Bitcoin will eventually appreciate.... Buy and hold with a long term strategy. The price will never go as low as $1.
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:10:30
because monero is more sophisicated than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:42:18
Awesome. Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:35:51
oh I see. I didnt know it actually exists. I'll check it out.
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:48:18
Buy bitcoin today and hold for 2-3 years, and you'll make a decent return. I predict 50 to 100 times your initial investment. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:24:03
Yo! Thank you Sir.
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:23:56
congrats my friend. Its a good achievement. i'm currently at 0.7btc and trying hard to get 1 btc before it booms. must feel great to have a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:11:42
you're correct
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:41:02
thank you sir
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:32:31
Bitcointalk doesn't portray a professional image to new users wanting to learn about bitcoin. Bitcoin is a technology, but if we cannot run a web forum properly after 5 years, then it looks bad.... I never donated, but I feel sorry for those that did. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:53:00
Obviously they'll be discussing the block size. Gavin wants to push ahead and increase the size this year.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:17:58
thats quite clever.

Don't sell. Keep holding them. Bitcoin is currently at a low. Wait a few more years.

what about face recognition. Laptop only responds to your face. If it detects trouble, it deletes the decryption key.
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:50:00
Theymos is a joke, and bitcointalk sucks. The site is full of scammers and trolls and the shite, sorry site, should be deleted.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:14:17
Do you have your life savings in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-23 11:42:30
In order for bitcoin to be successful it needs to be apolitical.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:53:07
Can you do me a favour and roll me a new cold wallet address? thanks
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:29:41
Looks like junk to me.....
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:21:27
Not true. I use bitcoin all the time, and many people do.
btw Amazon doesn't even accept bitcoin, yet.
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:47:33
Bitcoin has zero debts. The fiat system is hundreds of trillions in debt.

I thought changetip was limited to $25?
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:57:32
Yeah, too risky. I'm going to keep my life savings in dollars until bitcoin becomes stable at $100k.... Better safe than sorry. Love U.
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:03:10
Was it claimed?
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:43:48

@_date: 2015-02-01 13:41:03
yeah, bitcoin crashed 90%. The Governor is crapping himself, diarrhoea all over the place.
