I will wait at least 1 hour for a response from you that you are expediting my transaction, like you have done for others on some of the reddit threads before I begin making the rounds warning others of my experiences, both good &amp; bad.
I realize that this message will simply get me pushed to the bottom of the "pile" if not ignored completely, but fuck it. About to commence Actively recommending BitInstant Boycott on every page I can humanly post too, &amp; I won't be the first person. It would seem it is the only way to get a non canned robo-sponse from what appears to be a non-existent customer service "team"
I have never had a problem with BitInstant in the past &amp; even recommended it to other as the way to go. I generally have a lot of patience &amp; as a business person I am fully aware that shit happens &amp; it may take a while to correct, but as a recurring customer, your lack service surrounding this situation is atrocious. You are not only directly fucking with my finances. You are playing with my physical &amp; mental health. I realize that it's less profitable for you to process my measly $150 order than all of the other people with higher$ orders you are seemingly processing in random order (most profitable).
&amp; FORFUCKSAKE, Schrem (owner of BitInstant) even advises against investing bitcoin. Nice way of CYA against potential fuckery that ensues from potential mismanagement of a financial service. I'm not stupid, I am aware of the risk, so don't insult your entire client base while offhandedly excusing yourself from falsely advertising a service. Make this right. Figure out what you have to do to implement a few simple "best practices" because from my side they are seriously lacking.
Might save your company a lot of venom &amp; some rep in a situation where you might justifiably have a reason for this lack of service. Hard to tell with all the inconsistency.

" If ?? it's been properly logged?"  next you will claim the transaction ID was incorrectly given just like you claim incorrect wallets id's are the problem.

Logged issue several Times.  Still waiting for you to provide me with a RESPONSE, much less a solution.  I also refuse to accept "unannounced guests" at my place of business or my home.  But I don't generally piss off 1000's clients by playing with their money.  Enough to cause a raging mob.
