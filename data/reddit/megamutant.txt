Dude you went 20 levels deep fast. I think this guy just wanted to know if blockchain.info itself was a legitimate site. Which most people would agree it is. Still what this guy said is true.

I mean obviously you would be stealing someone else's bitcoins so theres that. Which stealing is illegal but seeing as bitcoins are a weird area atm don't know what would happen if you got caught. Although since bitcoins have an exact U.S. Dollar equivalent people might be mad.

I know but he still did literally what the side bar said not to do.
* My address is below in case anyone is curious/feeling generous
That is someone asking for bitcoins which is against the rules.
Edit: Also said he has already bought .5 Bitcoins but his wallet shows nothing.
Edit 2: Which I know he could mean to buy later but he said that he finally decided to buy .5 of a bitcoin today which why is he doing that after writing this instead of w/e heh got bored writing this.

Not sure why you would photoshop your address onto a stock photo.

Haha no problem, you should see trying to link the rules in a subreddit like advise animals or funny. They don't like listening to rules. I like rules.

[HOW COULD YOU](

Read the sidebar 
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

Hmm brand new account no other posts besides this. It is probably a sales pitch. Not saying that they are not reliable, just this doesn't give any credence that they are.
