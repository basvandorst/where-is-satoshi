Or maybe (and more likely IMO) JPM is going to open a crypto trading desk just like Goldman and it’s hard to fire people for a desk you wanted opened.  He had to backtrack either way.
I think the desk is more likely than the unload because unloading would mean he thinks it’s over.  A desk means he’s finally admitting that this is just getting started.  He’s too good of a banker to think he can predict the high mark of a bubble or movement before any real evidence suggests it’s slowing.

I like the UI better with coin ranking but it doesn’t easily show the info I use coinmarketcap for, which is seeing the market cap of coins on a single list as well as the market cap of crypto as a whole without scrolling a million miles down.
If they can fix those and I’ll probably never visit coinmarketcap again.  Without it, coinranking is basically useless to me.
Just honest feedback in case the coinranking people stumble onto this.
It really is a much better UI.

I read this in Conspiracy Keanu voice.  It works.

You could look into a service like Bit Wage as well.  That works even if the company doesn’t want to play along.

Great.  Now the secret is out about PistachioCoin.  It’s going to moon before I finish developing my position.

I actually agree with this.  It’s a classic [False Dilemma](  scenario.  It really lowers the effectiveness of the answers you get because it forces some non-small percentage of people into an inaccurate answer.

Your points aren’t wrong, but you’re replying to a troll account.  There’s a bunch floating around right now copy and pasting this exact sentence into nearly every bitcoin thread.  A bunch of usernames (almost all less than 3 months old).
Not sure what stirred the troll nest for this batch.

ETF rules in many countries require that the underlying asset is “regulated.”  Futures contracts are considered “regulated” whereas BTC itself is not.
So people looking to set up an ETF have to get it past the SEC (in the US, for example) and think that by making it about futures, it will be more likely to check that box and so be approved.

I think you’ll find that it is what’s called a “backronym.”

Assumptions are not great for surveys like this if you want useful data.  If that was the intent then the correct route would have been to add two new answers, one in which the answer is “both but more store of value” and the other would be “both but more a currency”.  This would isolate people who think it’s only one or the other (of which there is no shortage) so they can also be heard.
Assuming those people’s opinions don’t exist is deeply problematic.  And that’s before we consider that phrasing it the way its currently phrased is practically insisting on being both misunderstood and misinterpreted.
