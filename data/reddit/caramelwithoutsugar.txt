I found some! They are in a secret hot/cold/warm wallet that can only be opened with a secret decoder ring that some dead/live guy has! Right now, I am researching for the perfected [asset]( platform that has the cheapest exchange on the market and also offers a demo account for users who want to try it first, but I'd like my 100K, fiat only please, no crypto, I have bills to pay, and like to eat food.

From what I know, For each winner 10 losers. Bitcoin has to be seen as a sovereign asset that is beyond the control of any government. From there emanates its value. It's like digital gold. Those who do trading, those who buy it without knowing anything about cryptology, those who keep their bitcoins in exchanges, and those who buy it because the price has risen recently, have lost a lot of money. And that represents the majority. This isn't the best time for me to reply since I am still researching about online [casino]( where you'll find a constant stream of bonuses/promotions and also offers multiple traditional table games and slots plus they also offer fantastic five- and six-figure Bitcoin prizes right now but even many people buy ripple for the same reasons, Ripple unlike bitcoin is not sovereign money.

From what I know, it would be on the blockchain by using the private key hidding within.

For a while. To be honest, If someone had access to Satoshi's BTC and decided to sell it all in a short period of time prices would crash more than ever before, and it would be pretty much the only circumstance I could see myself taking out a loan to buy crypto.
Satoshi has been out of the picture for a good while now though, and probably wouldn't be able to force any unpopular changes to the protocol. Nothing he could do at this point would permanently tank Bitcoin. Even if he decided to come out and endorse BCH (A bit late), that would just start a lot of drama and discussion that might or might not end with a flip from BTC to BCH. Right now, I am [trading]( but honestly, they are basically the same coin.

Bitcoin could be issued as physical coins redeemable in Bitcoin. And for the first time in history it would be possible for anyone to check the reserves on the Blockchain. Also, I have a free time so I will take the opportunity to research about online [casino]( that offer fantastic five/six-figure Bitcoin prizes and offers a slew of live Bitcoin casino games with live dealers. I am trying to find the best casino right now.

Alex's Yalls node is on a pretty unique position. But it doesn't matter, LN has a fee market, albeit not really matured yet. One crucial thing is that wallet developers should educate people and suggest to open multiple channels to different nodes to avoid overpaying. Probably autopilots will eventually take fees into accounts if they don't already. From experience we will end up with some best practices of how to use LN if you manage your channels manually.  
Either way, already we have some big nodes that have really low fees, although that doesn't mean they can't change them to higher later on. So maybe in the future the protocol might have a "fixed fees" flag so you don't open to a cheap node which later puts some crazy high fees. This isn't the best time for me to comment since I am still researching about upcoming [exchange]( but wallets should also improve their UIs and warn of high fees before completing the payment. This is crucial.
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:23:18
 


You can't control what the market will do, but I think (LN) wallet providers might eventually provide historical info on nodes (if their fees are stable for long time etc.) which would be also fed to autopilots and users, to weed out any "maliciously-greedy" nodes. Also AMPs (Atomic Multi-Path Payments) will help enable more routes and thus reduce fees. Pushing for 3+ channels per user will make things much easier. Also, from what I understand the fees are headed to a % of the amount without much of a base fee. At the moment there's no max fee cap, so it depends on the volume you transact, so from a point on it makes more sense to transact on-chain.


I had imagined speed, but till now I haven't thought that multihop routing could be visualized as a lightning bolt, nice one :D
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:59:41
It will, 5 years from now. :)

This is why so many people believed in the upgraded Bitcoin Cash instead of the Lightning Network tokens... because the original whitepaper works and that's why Bitcoin Cash is King. Also, today is a busy day for me as I am on the quest to find a good [casino]( site which offers multiple traditional table games and slots plus they also offer fantastic five- and six-figure Bitcoin prizes. I am trying to figure out the cons and pros of every site.

 I think that the truth is that many people in Mexico (and in the world) have done poorly to get into cryptocurrencies to see it as an easy way to make money and understand the need to be regular in the best way.
@_date: 2019-02-09 14:19:48
Bitcoin Cash ABC. Most exchanges still list it under BCH, but some started listing it under BAB. Kinda ironic that Bitcoin forked into BTC/BCH, then BCH forked into BCH-ABC/BCH-SV, and now BCH-ABC is listed under both BAB/BCH depending on exchange. Got to go now as I am on the case to find a [cryptofund]( marketplace. I am trying to figure out the cons and pros of every market.

This is a pretty well known phenomenon in the crypto trading space. Gemini has been extremely defensive about gusd and banned many of their top trading clients from their exchange in an attempt to stop the flows of redemptions.
I'm pretty glad to see them getting exposed.
@_date: 2019-02-19 12:16:13
Maybe you are right. From what I know, Most people thought it had bottomed at 5k lol and then they got rekt. Anyway, I'm off, gotta [play]( now.

Blockchain doesn't lie so if the funds are still moving than that only means there is something shady going on. Who gives the password to one person? IDK sounds illogical to me. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:36:52
what is this raspi lightening? I may aware of other terms but this is something new for me. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 12:38:43
Thank you very much. I'm in the middle of my [game]( but I'll definitely check on those.
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:31:29
The blockchain makes all transactions public. I'm in the middle of my [trading]( session, but I don’t think the technology is the issue - it’s the regulation on the businesses.
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:49:56
That's not a bitcoin account.  is pro bitcoin.
 is pro BAB and that's villain who's behind that account.
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:38:03
Another stablecoin, except this one, will not be used by any other banks and will be subject to counterparty risk. Yeah, points for trying though. There was an attempt.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:13:49
It's tied to usd. So no real threat to Ri pple. You're exchanging usd for jpm coin which gets destroyed when you exchange it for usd. I'm in the middle of my [game]( but Ri pple allows you to buy their x rp with usd and the recipient can exchange x rp for their native currency. So... ultimately this is chasing own thing.
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:38:07
On the other hand, BTC hasn't reached the bottom yet, but if you held all your portfolios of 2018 and are selling now, that's definitely a bad move. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 15:27:03
Every GUSD is created by a person depositing a dollar on the Gemini exchange, so it is entirely from the public that builds the treasury. They then stop the people from returning the GUSD to exchange it back for 1 USD they can withdraw to their bank.
This isn't the best time for me to reply since I am still [playing]( but people like to get upset with Tether about their policies and rightfully so, but Gemini pretending they are the "regulated" and "legitimate" exchange and do things like this makes me happy to see them get bad press.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:31:12
 Yeah, I know. But still, comparing your company with something this negative is very ballsy, even if it's just a joke.

Fun theory: Satoshi is dead dude. Someone found out who he was and killed him for his Bitcoins. Only real explanation at this point.
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:13:13
I think if an algorithm designed to waste a resource is not something I support. Removing bitcoin’s grip on the market can only be a good thing for all projects, but it wouldn’t go away in any case. Mining would just move elsewhere, there’s too much money at stake. I just hope blockchain, in general, won't center around money. I saw some good project such as [Afrihealth]( that aims to provide superior medical solutions to the African continent, ultimately building a more efficient medical care ecosystem. Now that is something!
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:07:22
In a fiat system with potentially unlimited paper, shorting and paper gambling with futures should be banned. The odds lie with the guy who has unlimited fiat. Just to share, I am conducting a reaseach for the nonpareil crypto [casino]( that offers a slew of live Bitcoin casino games and also let you stake Bitcoins and chat with live dealers directly on your desktop or mobile device with live dealers, but probably not going happen so eventually bitcoin will have to rek fiat the long way

Or that it was never an individual to begin with and a fake name. The fact that there is no previous work or easily findable history or academic progress is a major red flag. You don't just stumble into this stuff without leaving some trail or a build up to it. Nevertheless, I am examining which crypto should I buy on this mind-blowing trading [platform]( I love it because it offers the highest paying referral for OTC services in the industry. 25% of the profit from the referral will go to the referrer. I think other exchanges will find it hard to match these offers. Going back, There are plenty of people who were around that could easily produce records/logs of the interactions from back then, and the same dead ends would come up.

I think it’s fair to say the whales were successful this week in shaking out buyers and longs. Just ask yourselves, does this price action entice people to buy more or sell more? Nevertheless, I am examining which crypto should I buy on this mind-blowing trading [platform]( I love it because it offers the highest paying referral for OTC services in the industry. 25% of the profit from the referral will go to the referrer. I think other exchanges will find it hard to match these offers. Going back, I think that the answer is to sell more. Whales create a mirage with the price action all the time in BTC, they don’t want you to profit with them when the price shoots up. They want you as FOMO bait.

Pretty courageous move, I say, comparing your own product to the tulip mania as a joke is pretty ballsy, since that mania was undeniably a real bubble. Just to share with you, I have set this day as my research day, I am looking for the perfect [asset]( platform that has the cheapest exchange on the market and also offers a demo account for users who want to try it first, but whether crypto is a real bubble or not is not yet determined, but if an exchange/broker is suggesting so, that's pretty hilarious. Kudos for bitpanda, although I don't know them in any way.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:33:09
Never-mind what you think about the coin. If people lose them after the 30th of April, that is completely unacceptable. Nevertheless, I am excited tonight as I trade on this finest crypto [exchange]( I just love this because Darb is engineered from the ground up with security, stability, speed, and scalability in mind. I am sure other platforms will find it hard to beat this. Going back, I think this is one of the many reasons that this space doesn't look professional. How often have you heard about banks/brokers saying: "Oh yeah you had British pounds by us but we decided on no longer dealing with them and since you didn't react within 2 weeks we get to keep them."
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:15:40
Agreed! I also love that Primedice utilizes the “provably fair” system for every roll of the dice. A player can check any bet they have placed, against the verification, and see firsthand, that it will confirm a win or loss. As it is the standard for Bitcoin gaming, it is also the only verification that could be used with a site’s popularity and transaction rate as high as Primedice’s are. This is one of my go-to-casino aside from [Vegas casino](
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:41:33
This is absolutely a world breaking record! Yea, this record should be added in Guinness world records. The owner of this online casino(Luckygames) must be really proud! Also, I like this altcoin casino because it has four fast-playing games with chat boxes and extra devices to use. They are all from their own proprietary software, and they have more enticing graphics than games at most casinos of this type. You have to be signed in to play them, though.
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:42:38
Great article! Yes, With Bitcoin it absolutely lower the costs for online casinos, the transaction is way more affordable as compared to the high fees paid to credit card processors. I also think we should push not only bitcoin but other cryptocurrencies to Online casinos. I think that  Gambling with cryptocurrency is simpler compared to gambling with traditional currency. And we’ve already established that online gambling is simpler than traditional land-based gambling. So, by using cryptocurrency, you’re making thing even simpler. Most cryptocurrencies aren’t considered to be currency. If you live in a country where online gambling is prohibited or severely restricted, like the US, you won’t be able to play real money online casino games, But you will be able to gamble using a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Litecoin without any problems.

Nice! I'll try that next time! I am more into their Roulette which is the standard European wheel and layout, with one zero and up to a 35-1 winner on the line.Their Cells game is kind of like Minesweeper. There are 195 cells and you are looking for a big multiplier. You can hit up to 5x your wager.
The minimum bet amount for each cryptocurrency is only 1 Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), and the maximum bet is 0.5 BTC. There is a mobile version of luckygames.io you can reach through the browser of your iPhone, Android or e-tablet. This is actually one of my favorites aside from Vegascasino.io.
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:37:37
Wow! A generous offer from Ignition Casino. I think this 200% btc deposit bonus is one of the best bonus, I've seen so far. I believe that is way cooler than other gaming site since they offer a wide mix of gaming options from developers such as Betsoft, Genesis Gaming, Relax Gaming and Random Logic Software. But the majority of games are provided by RealTime and Rival Gaming. Gamblers can therefore enjoy a good variety of games for a great gambling experience.
With a single account, you can access the Poker platform at this online casino too. Casual poker players will love basic poker cash games such as Fixed Limit, Pot Limit, and No Limit Hold'em and Omaha and Omaha-Hi Lo. There is also a high-paced, exciting poker game called Zone Poker where you are given only 15 seconds to act before you are relocated to a different table. This is my usual website for playing apart from [Vegas casino](  By the way, What do you like most about this casino? Please share it! Would love to know it.

It's truly a wonderful news! I was able to sell out some of my other crypto, and bought a good bag of BCH, I was actually only using BTC to play before and with Primedice, I will be able to now play using my BCH directly. From what I know, Primedice is one of the first ever Bitcoin gaming sites, the industry has slowly built to a large market of Bitcoin related transactions. Primedice was the first to launch a site, and although it is only a dice game, is still the most popular place players play at with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:30:48
Agreed! I also believe that playing online casino games with cryptocurrency allows faster, more secure and fairer gambling. On top of that, your winning chances are slightly increased, due to the fact that you don’t have to pay any fees on deposits and withdrawals and that you can benefit from lucrative bonus offers. Cryptocurrencies and online casinos are indeed a perfect match. I also play time to time at Vegascasino.io since I don't have the time to go to land based casinos.
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:46:15
 Not necessarily a bad thing it also means less short sellers bitcoin doesn’t need Cboe it does nothing for the network it’s irrelevant.
