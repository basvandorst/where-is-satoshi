What can you build with an Arduino that you cannot build with any computer?

I know.. I didn't come here looking for sympathy but rational arguments and ideas. I'm afraid this community is just about a bunch of kids that think they're smarter than the rest of the world because they bought a winner lottery ticket, and the only forward thinking they have is "to the moon!!!". sad.

So you think a world with more inequality than today is great?

Then I wouldn't use bitcoin at all...
Besides the technical concerns I was asking about the strategy. Do you guys think brainwallets are safer than paperwallets? And, among all the brainwallet options, is WarpWallet the best option?

I guess that the current wealth inequality in the world is ok to you. And I guess more inequality looks even better to you.
What I do not understand is why any attempt to fight this differences are derided. I'd appreciate a serious argument (if you have any).

1) This is just obvious. I never said everyone should have the same.
2) I don't know (and nobody knows) what fair distribution is. What I know is that current distribution is NOT fair. And I'm afraid Bitcoin can make it worse.
3) Can you elaborate on this?

The "laws of nature" argument doesn't really convince me, you could use it to say that wars/killings are natural and I'd still find them not good. We're given rationality to act "antinaturally" in all sorts of ways for the benefit of all of us.

I get your point, put it this way: in a world where there's only millionaires/billionaires and zero poverty, money is basically meaningless. Is a world where everyone has their basic needs more than covered and there's no struggling for survival. So, it's a world where inequality has come to an end and having 100x more money than another is no different from having 100x more pokemons in pokemon go. The world you just described is the same I'm defending.

"there's no rational reason to care that one person has a billion times more wealth than another" that's a bold statement. High levels of inequality implies tension is generated in lots of different dimensions: between workers of a factory and its owners, between poor and rich countries, etc. This tension causes conflicts, riots, desperate emigration... in short: high levels of inequality bring pain and suffering to a lot of people. I'll read these authors, however, you just have to look around to see that the world is pretty fucked up.

Gosh... I did not say wealth should be distributed equally. It's the current level of inequality that disturbs me. It causes refugees to cross the sea in desperation and die and lots of other injustices that could be avoided.
I'm just asking: imagine future in which wealth is more unevenly distributed than ever. Do you think bitcoin can pave the way towards that escenario? Do you think it's an encouraging future?
