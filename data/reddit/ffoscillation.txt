The thing now we don't care about Satoshi's Vision, he ain't GOD. He doesn't have implementation of sharding mechanism when blockchain size too big to fit on regular pc hdd anymore.. and lots of other problems..

I've gone through 8K to 5K drop.. 19K to 15K doesn't seem that much anymore :v
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:38


Lol.. why? That affects all coin not only bitcoin.. If you invest 1M, $30 tx fee is super cheap
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:14
That's basically what Segwit is, TELL ALL COMPANIES TO IMPLEMENT IT ASAP
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:31:40
in short, an attack against bitcoin.. long story, bch's fucked-up EDA taking away lots of btc hashpower because the possibility to mine lots of coin in short time (peaking around 42 blocks/hour).. slow block time leading to high fees, people fears they can't sell their btc on time, price drop.. etc etc.. roger ver using that knowledge to pump the shytcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:17:55
If you buy in an exchange and keep it there, there's no tx fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:47:05
Don't just post link and leave.. explain the thing.. people won't click a link just because you leave it there

He doesn't even have balls to dump all his btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:43
Looks like all these backlog will get processed in less than 24 hours.. last few days was a pain cus miners chasing EDA flash time sale
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:07:46
Nah.. just a stupid post, if miners can control it then that's not "bitcoin". Bitcoin is what most people agreed upon, by nodes, miners and users, no matter what Satoshi's opinion right now, afterall that's what he envisioned himself. No stopping it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:26:49
That's good for bitcoin too, no more miners left to hunt flash BCH time sale ;p
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:17:52
Maybe you should read why the tx fees can go up that way.. in normal case it won't take a fraction of that.. it's not about blocksize, less hash power lead to less block per hour lead to inflation of fees.. bch's EDA was the fault, not btc blocksize.. miners were chasing that very last EDA time sale, reducing btc hashpower significantly.. IT'S AN ATTACK AGAINST BTC, no matter intentional or not
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:32:32
If you don't see LN as a scaling solution then you're a moron
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:05:10
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:32:32
That's why they mine it to the hell today (around 26 blocks per hour).. after fork it'll no longer that profitable, they'll dump all bch soon (in 1-2 days) for instant profit. And the price will plummet
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:08:36
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:56:28
Nah. BTG will stay altcoin, but we can change PoW through consensus and stay Bitcoin. Well, every algorithm that not giving huge boost towards ASIC are good solutions, so when shits like this happens, non miners can just start their PC to help the network
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:09:07
Time to spread it all over the net and real life ;)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:55
I don't have pending txs but thanks for good work anyway :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:03
Then enjoy your profit and hold the bch.. i don't care lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:18:38
See that mempool size going straight down XD
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:21:19
Too late, the snapshot for the fork happened around Oct 25th

Lmfao "investor" .. that's just a mindset of short trader
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:03:51
helped a little with guiminer ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:38:20
better get all user to use segwit wallet and pushing service providers to implement segwit.. it's basically 2mb block
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:29:21
You'll be grinning very hard soon after bcash sinking hard (anytime within 2 days)
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:32:07
This, totally.. It annoys me very much when someone ask what to do with his money. "Do what you want" that's the best answer.

*cough* ETC *cough*
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:04:20
+1 man.. the clone coin morons would try to sell you argument that miners control the network and that's by satoshi design. whereas the truth is nodes, users, and miners must reach consensus to move blockchain forward, if one component is toxic, majority can ditch it. We can change PoW to toss these toxic asic miners aside. If necessary
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:02:13
all is ok.. it's expected as each node hold different set of txs
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:48:08
Yeah. the community can just pull the trigger to change PoW, toss these asic miners aside. And i can say that's better future for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:44:47
In the worst case we can still do PoW change.. let the shitty asic miners die
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:15:06
Look at bitcoin mining difficulty and number of running full nodes.. that's parameters to decide whether bitcoin is more decentralized than BCash
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:05:36
Hmm.. there was one guy want it for .1btc .. search it in sub
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:30:15
What? only miners can decide the fate of bitcoin? you jest. We can easily get rid of current miners and get new one..
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:25:24
Segwit should be similar to 2mb block if widely adopted. However, most of the wallets, exchanges, services reluctantly moving out of legacy address. They're delaying implementation of segwit for whatever reasons.. I don't get it
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:14:46
bitcoin daily github commit VS the last commit was 12 days ago for bitcoinabc (bcash)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:01:40
You forgot one thing, core can just change PoW instead of accepting s2x. Making all asic miners hardware obsolete, swapping this greedy big company miners with fresh one.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:53:03
Well, PoW change can happen if majority SHA256 miners attacking BTC.. No way that users and core devs would let their betrayal go unpunished.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:04:12
buy specialized asic miners or just run something like guiminer on PC, only run it when these shits happens. emergency hash power reserve
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:15:40
But someone over there clearly saying "bitcoin cash is bitcoin"... time to sue
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:32:29
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:50:11
Sorry but putting everything on main chain is not always the best scaling solution.. Just like when you install an app you sometimes left out unneeded features/modules aside.. With (optional) side chain new node can syncs faster by not downloading unnecessary parts (the sidechain) and smaller in size main chain. There's no 1 person can create perfect tech by himself, techs always perfected by the successors, it's foolish to blindly cling to Satoshi's designs. Sure you won't copy 1:1 Wright brothers designs for current gen aircraft right?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:33:35

what's down big time? from PoV of $4K buyers last month it's still hugely positive..
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:24:36
I'm waiting :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:07:15
when you under attack, retaliate..
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:57:59
if you think miners are most important aspect of bitcoin, then you're wrong.. nodes also part of bitcoin, those nodes always running on charity mode without any rewards unlike miners.. now, selfish miners want big blocks without consideration of nodes expenses.. greedy
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:05
it's over, the bcash fake pump. that's it
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:46:41
No i'm not going panic sell, i just wanna smack roger and co. in the face..
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:03:02
tx fees will back to normal in a few days.. no more EDA shit
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:06:35
Who knows... XD
They should though, afterall they take the risk opening futures market it is their responsibility.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:02:47
Lol when miners finally going back in rush to mine bitcoin after they done hunting bcash flash time sale?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:08:38
Yea that's pretty much it
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:33:56
Well they will steal code (again) for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:44:48

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:33:50
Don't tell me hitbtc too.. there are a lot of reports people got hacked on hitbtc with 2FA enabled
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:29:02
Yes. PoW change will lessen dependence against big company miners.
Eww,, jihadists
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:38:32
incoming 2mb block upgrade.. those block maniacs lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:57:15
Why not.. difficulty can go down, not always up. You should read wiki somewhere instead of asking tons of basic questions
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:24:20
They can reach very quick consensus that's the very proof of centralization
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:22:38
Tiny fees because the price is also a fraction of bitcoin.. Don't forget TX fees based on the crypto value not fiat
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:10:54
more difficulty + more nodes = less centralized.. if we can do PoW change now, that would be make bitcoin even less centralized
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:11:18
That's why you should never HODL pump and dump coin :p
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:02:15
This is what they get for zombifying the bitcoin implementation.. it will bite em back in ass
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:43:23
+1 miners gaming bcash EDA for the last time, cus they can't do it after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:54:53
give it a week, not everyone looking at bitcoin 24/7
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:26:55
Why.. because bitcoin can upgrade its block size anytime, while big-blockers chain can't just do block size reduction without big fiasco.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:05
I bet someone already did it.. if you want to help just keep pressing F5 on their page
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:41:47
Hashrate defects means one thing, that currently btc/bch mining are hugely centralized. PoW change can alleviate the problem. GPU mining will be more resistant to PoW change, unlike custom built ASICs. If majority of SHA miners really moving to bch, that's good, easier to pull PoW change trigger, toss bad actors aside. After that we can change PoW every once in a while to render new ASIC hardware obsolete.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:53:54
Nah.. looks like paid bcash shill
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:43:21
Do what you want no one is stopping you.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:07:19
THIS +99999. Man honestly these people talking about scaling actually has no idea about the concept of scaling.. noobs
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:47:12
They'll all left bcash soon after difficulty retarget in less than 24 hours. The last one buying bcash ATH will bear the burnt big time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:42:47
wait.. no you won't lose your bitcoins.. miners have just come back from their hunt of bch flash time sale :p
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:11:05
And as usual b(it)ch chain as dead as ever without help of their EDA (next DDA)
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:06:23
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:12:15
that's why you add whitelist of nodes you trust.. you can never do it alone
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:15:45
What fork? no fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:54:36
Looks like dead again
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:57
why? miners are doing their job right now.. they were busy chasing the very last EDA time sale
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:18:45
S2X (fork from BTC chain) is cancelled, while Nov 13 fork (from BCH chain) is just an upgrade, no free coin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:14:22
+1. Someone with at least half year in btc market would be unfazed by this correction.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:20:21
Thanks to that i can HODL moar :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:34:17
We (as users and devs) can just change PoW, toss the bad actors (miners) aside if necessary, they'll be stumped with their obsolete asic hardware.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:53:44
Huh? After bcash difficulty retarget btc will be 2x profitable
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:52:43
Japan will make some probably
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:14:50
Even better if you put it in the date and details :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:21:36
It's obvious of most obvious but morons still trying to jump in. lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:30:39
Basically EDA keeps BCH alive like a zombie, DDA put it back to its place among altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:21:39
whatever.. you clearly breaking this sub ruless anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:58:41
what gainz? btc can go up fast before that coin can even react.. pump and dump session is over for that coin
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:47:11
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:21:12
Sticky this pls
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:42
Or they realized that they were used for evil purpose.. stopping it before they get the burnt too
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:50:43
Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman :p
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:05:50
It should be coming faster when these morons not doing any drama hardforks
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:23:58
Nov 13 bcash hardfork..
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:37:26
But man.. honestly every failed take over will make bitcoin stronger, as new timers learned how to HODL correctly
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:26:29
That and miners revolt.. that's why devs keep evaluating possibility of PoW change
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:23:22
This, in normal use case it segwit should be similar to 2mb block. That's the best stop gap scaling solution right now. The thing is, i asked various wallet devs they seem reluctantly implements segwit. So to the day most of segwit block are still in 1mb-ish range. *sigh*
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:57
Time for bitcoin fomo :p
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:27:13
Honestly bitcoin is still working really fine if there's no 0 fees spam attack from small block haters. They keep doing it outta greed
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:47:10
No, also we have testnet
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:41:27
If miners keep exploiting EDA, BCH price can only go downwards. Not my problem though, i already sold all that free coins already.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:40:34
No, maybe you should learn more about the world. Not all average guy has spare money to buy 1 bitcoin, especially in growing countries with most recent price. Moreover, bitcoin has limited supply, it is designed that way 21 millions max. More blockchains? Yes, but not bitcoin... ethereum, litecoin, and many other coins. People constantly trading these alt-coins against fiat or bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:33:45
as if all 7 billion of people even heard about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:13:34
not yet, there'll be another multiple inflated expectations as bitcoin moving to get wider adoption
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:55:13
Nuh uh.. people will never sell it for $0 after spending that big chunk of money on electricity and hardware
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:15:31
It's always win-win but it might be far lower than your expectation. If you don't want that just stfu and invest elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:50:07
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:23:20
You can draw a conclusion that lack good samaritans in country where such law exists. If there's need to force people to do good deeds then there's somethings wrong with the (country's) society.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:19:22
Pls no, it's worse than ads if they forced upon you
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:54:01
Yeah disgusting bcash religion, they should accept it that the biggest market cap is the true bitcoin. These purity obsessed jihadists should just kill themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:03:22
yeap recently hordes of indian spamming their ref links all over the net, especially exchanger's trollbox
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:55:13
the biggest cap = bitcoin, anything else is shyt coin
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:00:50
well all boils down to miners, if somehow bcc beating btc market cap, they can put high tx fees anytime.. i don't buy "big block solves tx fees issue" claims.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:41:28
fork the firmware :p
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:17:18
HODL and RISE forever
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:36:02
why should i care.. HODL
i've done it since $900
