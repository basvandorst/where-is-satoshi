So the same as how banks work with USD except these LN nodes do not have accounts with each other, they will use the bitcoin protocol to exchange value between each other. In traditional banks they have accounts in each other or a third party that they debit and credit USD in their books at the end of business day.

Some people think a technology needs to do everything. In reality it just has to do one thing very very well. Instead if cryptocurrencies being generalists they need to be specialists. I would like for bitcoin to get a very large valuation, have a very low price volatility, and have the most secure network. Ideally to one day replace gold. There are other cryptocurrencies that can perform instant, anonymous transactions.

~~Nothing~~ What is stopping bitcoin from being used in fractional reserve banking? All that is required for a bank to be using a fractional reserve banking system is to take deposits and make loans. Alice deposits all her currency into the bank. That bank shows her balance as X. Bob takes a loan out in the amount of Y. The bank keeps a small portion of Alice's money, the reserve, in the bank and uses the rest to give out loans to people like Bob.
If you give your private key or transfer your bitcoins to another entity that controls the private keys, then they can easily lend that bitcoin to someone else.
Currently, the thing stopping bitcoin loans is the dramatic price appreciation of bitcoins. It would be terrible to take a loan of 1 bitcoin back in 2012 and have to pay that bitcoin back now.

The bank does not create their own money. The central bank may do so if they have that ability mandated by their government, like the Federal Reserve does. To combat a bank run the central bank could reduce the reserve requirements and/or the bank could call their loans.
The bank creates money because the liabilities the bank has on the deposits are considered money itself. If Alice put $X in the bank she has $X on the books even though 90% of that has been loaned out. At no point is the bank printing money.

Don't be condescending. You have no idea what I am looking for. Bitcoin won't be the best store of value until the extreme volatility goes down.

If something like bitcoin is used as a store of value and replaces something inefficient like gold then the value of a single coin would be more than $100,000 a coin. I'm not saying that will happen but if central banks start owning cryptocurrency on their balance sheets then the price is going to go a lot higher and will stay there.
Bitcoin is still only at Stage 2. Stage 1 was getting it started and starting a community around it. Stage 2 was about having adoption outside of the cypherpunks community. The technology still needs to improve to remove points of failure. One that is still occurring is security. We should be able to exchange bitcoins without the need of an exchange. Stage 3 won't occur until the next financial crisis and the USD implodes.

Calculating the average return is meaningful unless someone sells when it goes up to 10,000%. Most likely they are holding during the ups and downs. 
Imagine you have $10,000 and it grows in year 1 at 100%, leaving you with $20,000 value. The next year the investment falls 50% which makes the original value to $10,000.
Over the two years you neither made or lost money. The zero percent you received is the CAGR. If you computed the average return it would be 25%. You didn't make a 25% return. This shows that average returns is pointless.

[More]( like a few dollars a month to $20 a month for a node running on AWS. Nothing huge.

Once the Segwit gets activated via BIP91, couldn't the nodes just upgrad to Core with Segwit and not go through the hard fork to increase block sizes to 2mb?

I agree. I just think being written in MS ~~Doc~~ Word is not a valid criticism. 
Edit: I don't use Word so I forgot its name.

To get ahead in China people often join the Party. It is like joining the Boy Scouts in America. It is for personal or your specific network's promotion rather than national interests.

I am not aware of any organic molecule that machines would need if they are using nuclear energy and electric motors.
If they are using petroleum based power like we do for most things then it could be a problem, but they would not be in any different place than were we currently are.

They would probably need plastics which are made from petroleum and some are made from plant based materials.

When I reread the first page it only talks about online transactions and the lack of trust merchants can give to customers which causes the need for centralized third parties and high transaction costs. 
1. There is nothing about buying a cup of coffee or goods in person. 
2. Bitcoin can be said to have higher transaction costs for many things than traditional third party vendors. 
So it seems that is where the current split is over.

It doesn't vindicate him. He was still embezzling coins. He just couldn't embezzle as much as he wanted because someone was secretly stealing bitcoins from 2011-2013.

Most likely those that are not interested in a new altcoin would sell theirs even at a discount to people that would support the new altcoin. 
What do you think of increasing the miner reward back to 50 each time to support users that are now mining the altcoin?

No it doesn't mean that. FDIC insurance is for USD only and on those exchanges that have that insurance. It doesn't cover bitcoin and people can just put their coins in their own personal wallets.

There are two situations here. One is the increase in the money supply. In hyperinflation business don't have a greater need to sell goods because they can wait to sell them tomorrow and get more money for it. This is one reason why goods become more scarce and more valuable. The demand is still there but now there is less bread being sold so like you mention the price will still climb. 
Substituting their currency for another would be the first step. It will take time for the supply of goods to increase but first a valuable currency needs to be established.

Read [this]( on capital losses and how you can use to offset your gains. If you sell and have a loss you can use that loss on future tax returns to shelter any gains.

Great analogy. As the [Wright brother's patents]( stalled development of the aviation industry in the U.S. it is especially needed to kill any patents or develop broad patent pools in the early stages of bitcoin.

I agree, but I read a study that I cannot now find that showed a large percentage of nodes were being hosted from AWS.
I have noticed when I run a node that my uploads are larger than my downloads and many people's home internet have very small upload amounts than their download.

When a government or central bank inflates the currency it is in effect reducing your purchasing power and stealing the value of your money. Not that gold cannot be inflated. Adding more gold to the market reduces the value of gold and its purchasing power.

The only return that matters is the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) because it smooths out the volitility. CAGR since 2012 is 228%. Since 2013 when I believe bitcoin became more mainstream CAGR was about 150%.

I sold some in 2013 at a 400% profit. Glad I did because I kept them all in Mt Gox. A few months later Mt Gox was gone.
