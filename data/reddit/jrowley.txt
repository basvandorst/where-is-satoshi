As a longtime Bitcoin user, I understand the idea of soft-forking being a simple restriction on transactions. But, Bitcoin is also my academic interest, and academia requires citations, which I've been hunting for for a while. If you have citations I'd be very grateful for your sharing.
Also, care to expand more on OP_CLTV? I've been out of the loop for a few months while finishing the last of my coursework.

I know I'm 4 months late in asking for followup on this, but your point is interesting. Any links to articles I should read? This is really interesting from an academic^1 (and practical^2) perspective for me.

I know I'm many months late, but can you provide links that back up your math?

What I like about Alex is that sometimes he's a troll, but sometimes he writes really well thought-out pieces. This is just him being a troll.

Hi there! Since I have your attention, what's the origin of your username?

If they used Gox as an exchange partner, maybe.
@_date: 2014-11-16 03:31:54
Right, because the price is volatile and recurring payments would unnecessarily expose gilders to exchange risk.

People have broken into houses to steal Bitcoin mining rigs.

It's a MacBook Pro from a few years ago. Still going strong.

Cool! Thanks for answering my question. 
Keep killing it!

The model train company had a privacy policies that limited their ability to disclose revealing information (like his email address) to untrusted third parties, this guy could sue the hell out of them.

How's APIcoin going?

All I'm saying is that with time the identity of the creator of anything doesn't matter, once the technology is publicly available in the form of a patent or open source code. 
And that I think you're giving members of the public (who'll ultimately use Bitcoin) too much credit. A good percentage of the public believes "Bitcoin has been hacked" and an even bigger percentage believe that Steve Jobs invented the computer. Both are untrue. 
As a thought experiment, let's say that Satoshi is ultimately revealed to be a front for the Yakuza. This *might* cause a crisis of credibility in the Bitcoin ecosystem. But then we'd all just shift to a crypto with known founders, like Litecoin.

As someone who has used and abused your service (much to the chagrin of my friends, family and co-workers) I'm proud to have your sticker on my laptop. 
Your service has empowered so many people with the knowledge that they too can find answers to questions *on their own*. Thank you.

I still have a hard time buying your argument. The origins of many of the things we rely on, not the least of which is the financial system we use today, are unknown and at this point largely irrelevant. That we know some things about Satoshi Nakamoto's purported ideological leanings is more than we know, say, about Nathan Rothschild, the progenitor of modern international finance in the early 1800s.
As for a set of questions you ask in an edit:


I would say no. Take for example the TOR network, a safe haven for black markets and privacy-centric folks (some of whom harbor anarchist and radical political beliefs). It received its initial shot of funding from the US Naval Research Laboratory, under the aegis of DARPA. Support for TOR was subsequently handed off to the EFF and then ultimately to a standalone 501(c)3, but as of 2012, as much as 80% of the Tor Project's annual budget comes from the US government. 
Does that matter to developers and users of the TOR network who usurp power from the US Government in small and sometimes large ways? No, because its open source code stands alone from its creators, to the point that its creators and their financial backers do not matter. Not to devs and not to end users.

Two questions:
1. Is there a relationship between bizhongchou and JUA.com?
2. Is there a relationship between 8btc.com and yangyang.tv?

Hi there! I wrote this little article.

I... feel kind of dumb. Thanks for the reply.

That's always an option
