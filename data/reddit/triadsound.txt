Only 10k BTC? What are you waiting for!

Wasabi uses coinjoin. You never give your bitcoins to someone else.
Check out [this last wasabi coinjoin tx]( for instance and you'll see. You just couple your transaction with other people's transactions but you send to one of your own addresses. Because you all send the same amounts, an outsider can't tell who is who after the tx.
I have done a few of those now and it really works nicely. You just have to wait a while until enough peers are ready but this will surely improve with increasing usage over time. Another similar project is [joinmarket]( where you can even earn a little bit as a liquidity provider, but I haven't tried this out yet. I think these coinjoin privacy methods have among the most promise for Bitcoin because we can actually use them right now and we don't have to trust someone else with our coins.

Woha calm down tough guy :D
Please elaborate and share with us your boundless block forensics wisdom. I am looking forward to some entertainment.

Yes it could but only reasonably when sent to empty addresses. Otherwise they will be just sent along with the funds already in the address which would achieve nothing.   
From my observation these satoshi spams are typically advertisments. This was also the case here - a mixer used this method to advertise for itself.

I'll keep joining and I think you guys will reach 100 soon enough. Just yesterday there were quite a few joins with 20 peers. I can imagine in the future there will be differently sized pools (eg. at 0.05, 0.1 and 1 maybe?) to accommodate various user needs.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:08:29
I'm no expert, but if you are careful with your coins after going through a few coinjoins I'd say you are safe. Even after one with 20 peers it is not likely to identify a user just from that transaction but I think they estimate optimal privacy at 100 peers so they aim for this number of participants per coinjoin.
u/nopara73 is the dev of wasabi, I have read many of his posts on Bitcoin privacy here before so he can surely give you some links!

This story is fishy though. So supposedly evil bots 'manipulated' the price by dumping USDT wich resulted in tether losing its peg and the accounts of these people had to be locked. Are tether holders not allowed to sell their USDT? If tether is backed by USD, what's the problem - just buy every USDT back to keep the peg. Bitfinex and tether are as shady as they come.

Thanks for the OSX support. Tried it out today and it was pretty neat! My last round has been hanging without confirmations though because there seems to be a spam attack going on currently.
Is there or will there be a way to view  coin balances per address inside the wallet? So far I haven't seen a way to select or view the exact addresses my coins are in, only select them as a 'group' so to speak when sending/coinjoining etc.

Stupid and unfriendly is not a great combination mr internet tough guy.  
Learn about manners first, then about 'block forensics' second and when you come here again you won't have to make a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:01:13
But what would this 'dusting attack' achieve? You don't need to send BTC to an address to trace where it sends funds to. And if they/their wallet combine outputs from multiple addresses you can also see these connections without sending them dust. Can someone elaborate please?
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:59:37
You don't need to send BTC to an address in order to trace where it moves funds to.
@_date: 2018-10-20 20:40:55
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:05:29
Yes previously used and empty. Well you really have to spell it out for some people :D
@_date: 2018-10-23 21:30:43
Act quick! Create a new tx with a much higher fee to an address of yours. Look into 'replace by fee'
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:54:39
Agreed and I think it is this guy:  
[  
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:58:43
Hm that might be possible. It would explain the low amounts and the 'Unable to decode output address ' message
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:04:49
Where do you see that this is their address? I doubt they have 80k BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:07:21
Hahahaha  
Please continue.. top shelf entertainment!
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:06:01
Ok epic!
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:38:56
Are you certain the BTC in your possession are not tainted and linked to crime? The only way to be certain of that is if you mine them yourself or don't use Bitcoin at all. What about the cash in your wallet, are you sure it is not linked to crime?
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:38:18
I sometimes wonder if when shit ever hits the fan, physical bullion would actually be a viable payment method. Personally I'd have no method at hand to discern whether a coin handed to me is real gold/silver or something else.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:02:42
It's really strangely stable right now. I think just when we get used to it we will see some action again.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:12:10
Then it would just be sent along with the funds already in the address and achieve exactly nothing.
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:48:02
Thanks for the thorough explanation! It's really an awesome project you are working on there, wish you all the best. The coinjoin tx finally got confirmed after hours of waiting.  
Another thing, what is the technical reason for the need to have the wallet running? I assume that all participants have to sign the full tx together, but is there at least a theoretical method for the individuals to sign their's and broadcast it to your backend where they are later combined when the full number of peers is reached?
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:21:20
Ok you're probably right, I really can't think of any other reason for these sends. I have always been wondering why people do that. The only times the motive for these dust spams is clear is when a message is attached or when the sending address itself is some sort of advertisement e.g. 1BuyViagrax1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX
@_date: 2018-10-27 11:35:02
Careful out there guys. At least two of those 'top 5' don't even exist anymore. Use wasabi wallet or joinmarket instead.
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:14:24
Yeah I mean I get your point. Authorities could just observe the exits of the 'coinjoin pool' and inquire about all coins that are sent to exchanges. But eventually this will be useless and I think true fungibility for Bitcoin is an absolute necessity and coinjoin projects can help take us there.
