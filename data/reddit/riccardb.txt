If you give people your money, then your are giving them your trust.  You do not have to use a bank to hold your cash with fiat or with bitcoin. 
 Or you can.  Either way is your decision.
Bitcoin doesn't prevent people from using any array of financial services they choose.  What Bitcoin DOES prevent is central debasement of value.

Bread might kill you if you have a wheat allergy.  That's not what gives things value.
Yeah, we've heard the argument a million times.  It's how laymen understand value. Anyone off the street will tell you all about intrinsic value because that's what someone told them and it makes sense at first blush.
But value is nothing if not a number reflected in terms of money or some instrument of barter, and intrinsic value is circular logic that will never give you a number.
It's just not a valuable concept for academic discussion or understanding of how value is really set.  Again, it's circular logic:  it has value because it has value.  You're not saying anything.
When you can show me a dollar amount as a result of your explanation, then you've explained value.  Until then, you haven't.  
My explanation leads you to being able to determine a dollar amount.

Warren Buffet - a very smart man - cannot understand how to put a valuation on Apple or Google.  He also thinks Bitcoin is going to fail.  He is a smart man, a man of his time.  Bitcoin will have its time, but Buffet will not be around to see it.  He doesn't understand it, but that is not a fault of the man it is a perspective born of his education and experiences.  
People born more recently will readily accept Bitcoin because they understand technology and how technology has liberated their generation.  It will be a matter of time before the "new school" becomes "old school".  One way or another, given enough time, Bitcoin will happen much in the same manner that the Internet happened.  Over time.

Perhaps, if we stick to potatoes it will help out.  Banks want potatoes, not BTC.  They want the oil, the gold, the real estate.  Not the BTC.  Nobody wants BTC... they want the potatoes.  That's CRITICAL to understand.  What's important is value.
You want value, I want value - banks want value, everyone wants value.. not money.  So lets stick to potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 1BTC can buy you 104 potatoes
That's 4% deflation. The BTC amounts never change, but their purchasing power does.
Banks want to increase their *VALUE* using money... so they want to get back 5% more potatoes, and they don't care how many BTC they get.  
So, with 4% deflation on 1BTC, now .96 BTC buys 100 potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 0.96BTC can buy you 100 potatoes
The bank wants to make a 5% profit which means .96 * 1.05  means they need 1.008BTC to clear a 5% profit 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:22:21
Well, they aren't correct in regard to scarcity - because BTC is infinitely divisible.  It would be almost impossible to have a fiat currency, or gold currency, that's deflationary because you can't divide it as the value increases which leads to scarcity.
  This is a commonly misinterpreted point about bitcoin.  This is one thing that can be changed about bitcoin: it is currently divisible to 8 decimal places, but the protocol can be updated to allow more divisibility.  There will not be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin under the current protocol, but rather 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis.  And then we can divide it more if needed.

NICE WORK.  Obviously they have a gap in their training if their tellers don't already know how to properly handle deposits and withdrawals depending on whether it's the account holder in front of them vs someone else.
Hopefully they send a memo out to everyone and adjust their training.
And to anyone that thinks cash offers reversibility: it never has offered this.  If people choose to give you money back, that's a choice they make not a feature of a particular currency.  Visa offers reversal, but Visa isn't cash.  Visa one day will probably allow you to pay your bill with Bitcoin.  Irreversibility is a feature of the bitcoin protocol, but it's also a feature of cash.  Another big mistake many people make when comparing bitcoin to cash.  
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:01:49
It works exactly like gold.  
Inherent value is not what gives money value.  It's never been what gives money value.   
That's why we have bank runs...  Paper fiat works until people doubt it. Value is all about perception. 
Obviously I'm right - because bitcoin can be used to buy things, ergo it has value. Value is external, not internal to money.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:42:09
 For the sake of discussing divisibility let's say BTC increases in value forever. (Deflation)
If the dollar did the same thing, a penny would eventually by a car.  How do you buy a sandwich?  You can't divide a penny so you can't buy a sandwich.  How many people could afford to own a penny?
BTC doesn't have that particular problem.  In can always be divided smaller, if needed.  For example, into 100ths of a penny...

This type of attitude is great for soundbites and media coverage but this type of thinking will not be very useful in securing the future of Bitcoin.  Allowing people to believe that Bitcoin's future is absolutely secure is doing the community a dis-service.

Man, I think we're saying the same thing - we're getting caught up in a slight twist of semantics...  
 I'm saying that the graph shows the gap between production and REAL wages and that it would not exist if not for inflation.  I'm positing that one of the /effects of inflation/ is to take away the /benefits of increased production/ that we would all benefit from if it were not from inflation...    You don't see the gap unless you /adjust wages for inflation/... therefore the adjustment for inflation is what's showing you the gap, therefore showing you the effect of inflation in regard to that particular issue.
Listen to this:  
I'm saying that a deflationary world currency is what we need in order that we all benefit from increased efficiencies in production.  I'm saying that central money "printing" is siphoning off the increases in economic output.  
I'm saying that a deflationary currency is the proper way to distribute efficiencies in production, fairly, to all of humanity.  Reference this comment:   
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:50:38
Right yes I suppose in absolute terms you are correct. 
However, if you did not know that the box has $125 and then you were simply speculating.  I'm not sure that discussing speculation is particularly useful in understanding value.
 Also, consider that the value of the currency is in fact completely set by market forces, so you are actually also arguing that the $125 face value is in fact still worth the $125 in purchasing power.
But it's a very interesting argument, and then we are tempted to call all market forces speculation simply because we can prove speculation exists - but I believe that is really the answer to your question:  yes, speculation exists in the market... But eventually the real forces that drive value in the market will win out.  For example, competition or manufacturing innovation, or in the case of Jackson Pollak, perhaps modern art goes out of style.

That being said, if you ran a store with high traffic you would see counterfeit money, outright theft, and everything else under the sun.  You might even see a few idiots try a double spend.  They will not get away with it any better than a theif gets away with stealing outright by taking something off the shelf.
In practice, this is a non issue.

Sounds good to me.  If it works, do it.  You could use separate wallets and separate exchanges.  Perhaps coinbase and other companies and exchanges could offer multiple "wallets" or "accounts" as a feature so you can do this sort of thing.  Banks offer people multiple accounts for the same reason.  We can use separate wallets at each layer of the ecosystem to do the same thing.  Makes perfect sense to me.

This is not specific to Bitcoin.  This is a general computing problem at all datacenters and computing environments.  That being said, this is especially a priority in HPC environments, such as supercomputers or bitcoin mining. 
Solving it is not really the question.  We know how to use liquid cooling for very high-efficiency cooling, and it's becoming more and more mainstream:  
The heat is simply a byproduct of inefficiencies in processing technology.  Now you've harvested the leftover heat.  The question now is simple:  What do you do with it?  
1) You could use this to heat water  (we can also easily use the sun for this, but the sun is sometimes hidden by clouds - which is why we currently use gas and electricity to heat water)
2) In winter months, you could heat living areas
3) There's a ton of other ways to harvest heat.  You can even use heat to cool:  
Really, there's a ton of ways.  The bottom line is simple, though. People need to be able to save money with the technology, whatever it is, or they are not likely to use it.  In many other countries, for example, they rely on solar heating for their hot water but in this country it's almost non existent.  So another factor beyond saving money is - do I save enough money to make it worth my while?  In poorer countries, any money savings usually justifies the innovation - however in richer economies it usually takes very significant savings to justify an innovation in green energy.  Keep in mind that poorer nations are usually poorer in terms of resources at EVERY level, not just the individual level, so often times the resources must be conserved at any cost.   Whereas the abundance of natural resources in richer nations is in fact partly the reason they are richer.
Anyway, there's a lot of cool stuff out there for saving money on energy, if you're interested..

Personally, I have never found any money on the ground and picked it up.  For example, I did not find $50 in a parking lot one year during the Christmas holiday rush and spend it on gifts.  Also, when I delivered pizza for a while there... I reported all my tips.
People talk about economics professors *swearing* that they report everything on their return.  Obviously they say that because you'd be a dumbass to admit to tax fraud.  You'd also be a dumbass to report a found quarter on your tax return, or $50 you find in the parking lot, or a mined bitcoin... unless there was something you could gain by doing so.
For example, you might be able to gain the home office tax deduction if you have a bitcoin mining operation wherein you dedicate a room in your house to the purpose of mining bitcoins.  If the dedicated room took up 25% of the square footage of your house, then you'd be able to deduct 25% of all rent, utilities, and equipment costs from your income.

Ok, so that's the "real world scenario" concept.  Where the end is always "guess who didn't use bitcoin?"  And it conveys a way that Bitcoin can improve their life.  Could be anything:
1) cash under mattress, theif taking it
2) made a big sale but check bounced
3) got paycheck, but huge fee taken out
4) poor kid needs to send money for some heartbreaking reason, scrapes together the last cent but breaks down in tears when he finds out western union is going to take a fee

Yeah that's true now, because right now anyone with any sense knows that it's up for a huge growth sprurt.  Almost nobody uses it today.  As people CLAMOR to ride the increase in value as worldwide adoption continues, eventually there will be enough adoption to where the value levels out and is relatively flat.  Bitcoin will be inflationary until 2140... so your entire argument has nothing to do with deflation.    Bitcoin is actually inflationary at this stage.  What you're seeing now is simple supply and demand economics.  Bitcoin WILL BE deflationary, but not in our lifetimes.  The biggest innovation now is that there is a HARD CAP on inflation that nobody can change.

The point I’ve been trying to make is that in an inflationary economy if you set the nominal rate at 15%, and you have 4% inflation, your real rate is 11%.
To get the same real rate in a deflationary economy, just set the nominal rate at 7% and you have the same 11% real rate.
That's what I've been trying to say., but using different terms.  The point is that you can structure a loan, when all factors are considered, to make a profit for the lender, and the borrower would borrow if they thought they could benefit from the loan.  This is how it has always worked.  The idea that it cannot work in a deflationary world is simply a misunderstanding in regard to how interest is calculated and ignores the fact that deflation is simply one variable in the overall equation.

Miners are investors.  Many of those miner-investors are not technical people. For the rest of us investors, the profit margin wasn't there for the rest of us early adopters for it to make sense to mine, so I would agree that most of us are investors, but many are not miners... But we are all early adopters.  Seems to me you have time timescales mixed up.  These are very very early stages.  At least for a year more.  
My point is simple:  you're twisting the OPs meaning, playing semantics by using the term "early adopters" by sliding the timescale to trying to make it out like bitcoin has "been adopted" and that only rich white people have adopted it.

I understand regulation is a good thing.  
But all regulations currently in place are not necessarily good.
Keep that in mind folks.  Bitcoin will not necessarily be helped by regulation.  Some regulation yes, but do not automatically fall in love with any and all regulation.  Regulation has the power to refine and protect, but also the power to suffocate.
All sensible regulation should be met with suspicion, and carefully weighed.

Well without getting into all that, I would suggest that power is a force that is so closely intertwined with human interaction that it is easily conflated with rights but that rights are in fact a completely separate thing from power.  
Whether rights exist as a result of power or whether power is an expression of the rights is easily confused.   Not until you are able to separate them and examine them individually can you understand their true source.  


Anyway, back to my question... I agree that there are many reasons to hold something; respect it, find it sacred, enjoy it... yes...  and none of those require the concept of ownership.
But the answer, in my mind, in regard to ownership is this:  Hunger.  Hunger teaches us to own something.  It teaches us to have something for the sake of ourselves.  Our most primal needs and desires are what teach us ownership.  These needs exist with the first human.  It is survival.
Property is something inherent to the human experience and exists not as a result of rights and power, but rather rights are beliefs that are extensions of our most basic instincts.  Power is merely how we express or protect that which we believe to be our rights.  The outcome of the expression of power does not define the right, it defines the *effective rights* or rather the result becomes *the actual outcome* but not the right itself.   In other words, rights are ideas and power is the expression of those ideas in the real world.  The outcome does not make the beliefs disappear.
Anyway, the point is that property exists with one hungry human.

No, the bitcoin backed currency would be issued by a private bank, central bank or government.  I'm not suggesting that it's a good idea, I'm simply saying that it's possible.
The advantage with bank-issued bitcoin-backed paper bills and coins is that you can do the same things you can do with fiat, but the Bitcoin network provides the ability that we could publicly verify bank funds and be able to trust that our paper and coins was backed by real bitcoins.
Again, I don't think it's necessarily a good idea... but it's possible and might make sense in certain scenarios.  Also, keep in mind that only a very limited about of overall circulating bitcoins would be in this paper form... similar to how fiat is mostly in digital form even today.

Well, I think although surely he found fault with a few points in the article, he was simply trying to point out that the overall attitude of the UBS article was largely dismissive of Bitcoin's threat to modern banking and monetary policy... which is, arguably, indicative of hubris.
Something like Bitcoin has never existed before, so I find their dismissive hubris rather uninspiring myself.  I'm invested in Bitcoin, and I know it's not a sure thing, but to read this paper and not be smacked in the face by the arrogance of their analysis would be hard to do.

No, there is no objective value.  You're trying to say that the universe is a thinking being that can assign value and meaning to objects as a result of what they are.
This is impossible.  The universe does not think.  
You and I think, the universe does not think or have needs or desires.  Words have meaning, just like objects have value.   Words and objects exist outside of ourselves, but they do not have meaning or value outside of ourselves.  Value, like meaning, is external to the object, not inherent.  
It is a perception, a thought, a desire, an emotion, a concept or a need.  
It is *utility for a purpose as far as a person perceives its utility*, combined with *market forces* that assign value.    If you can't put a number on value, then you haven't a valid theory on value.  To suggest that "it has value because it has value" is circular logic.  You need a number.

I just realized... in the short term, this is actually great news for institutional investors.  We need more capital in the system.  Treating bitcoin as a product for tax purposes will allow institutional investors to treat bitcoin like a stock, bond or other investment and is a much better treatment for them than a currency.
In the long term, this is not good news... but bitcoin needs to grow more before it truly becomes a solid, stable currency.  This tax treatment will help it grow.

You're confusing economic terms with philosophical terms.  In economics, intrinsic value is simply "cost to produce".  It has nothing to do with usefulness.
  Usefulness in economics would be an external factor, it would be an idea in your head. It's external to the item's value because it has nothing to do with the cost to produce.
Market forces are supply/demand, yeah.
Maybe I confused a few things, but I think you're a bit more off in your terms than you realize.  If you understand that intrinsic value is simply "cost to produce" when discussing economics, and you understand that supply and demand COMBINED with usefulness are ultimately what set prices.... Then... You are also in agreement that the "intrinsic theory of value" is false.

No.  They do not lend out a fraction!
Unless your idea of a fraction is 20/1. 
They are "printing money."  If they have $5 in deposit, the fed will ALLOW THEM to loan $95 NEW dollars.  They can print money as long as they have a fraction of assets in reserve.   The assets can be various instruments, like credit default swaps.  And they can be valued according to various bullshit accounting practices.
 Thats why banks want deposits.  Deposits are the ticket to printing money on which they can charge interest.  
They get to print money (causing inflation) and charge interest on it.  What a great deal for the common man!
Fractional reserve just means "printing money as long as you have a small fraction of the overall total backed by a real asset"

Again, this is something that is absolutely viable for quick-serve scenarios where there is essentially low risk to the merchant.  For larger purchases, waiting ten minutes is the right way.

Inflation is measured in prices, because prices are a reflection of value.
So I'm really not sure you understand how it works.  Everyone knows most dollars aren't in printed form.  Basically everything you said doesn't counter anything I said.

Also this comment sums up the horror of this mans beliefs.:
CS Lewis -
"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their consciences."﻿

The loan principal could be pegged to a consumer price index.   The interest rate would be set according to whatever was reasonable for the bank to make their profit.  
This is possible now with an inflationary or deflationary currency.  The currency is irrelevant.  It's all about selling a loan product that makes sense for the lender and the borrower.  
As a consumer, I'd be looking for a loan that has a fair interest rate for a borrowed principal that is pegged to inflation or deflation, so that I neither of us lose out on the movement of the value of the currency and the bank makes money and I am able to borrow at a reasonable cost.
This is done in many places around the world already.  In other words, you create a loan product that works for the circumstances.

Deflation means your house loses value?  
That makes no sense.  First off, houses generally do not beat inflation or rise in value.  Deflation means my bitcoin buys more house.   The real value stays the exact same in either economy.
My EXISTING investments denominated in USD may return less if USD moves from an inflationary to deflationary state, but if I am using a deflationary currency TO BEGIN WITH and making investments, then those investments are going to be structured properly so that I make money.
Loans will cost the same in terms of real interest.  The difference is that deflation will set a floor on the real interest rate.  Meaning that if we have 4% deflation then the bank will need to charge at least 5% to make any money.  You will not see a 4% or less loan in an economy with 4% deflation.  That's not the same as "loans costing more".

Again, as I said in my other comments to you, I think this is a correct statement.  But something interesting to think about:
If you consider the motivations of institutional investors, stockholders in general, individuals and companies both private and public... And you consider carefully the drivers behind their investment strategies... Inflation is at least a partial driver of investment.
In a world without short terminism, inflation would be even more important when considering long term strategy. 
But take it a step further... What effect would deflation have?  Would deflation in some ways disincentivise short terminism?  
I think it would... 
One of the primary reasons economists believe inflation is good is that it creates an urgency to invest, ergo deflation would seem to have the opposite effect and incentives toward more long term thinking...

Of course it is.  Anyone can see that.  That's my point.  You haven't said anything whatsoever that isn't repugnant to the basic knowledge of every man in the world *today*.
You expect me to believe that the proof of your contention lies in a world that no longer exists.  You expect me to believe that my property has been forced upon me by *my own might or the might of others* or some other unnatural and unseen force has convinced me that property exists. 
You are the one that has convinced yourself that because something isn't certain, or that because some ancient group of people do not desire property, that property is not a right.  
People such as yourself love to claim the trappings of intellectual thought and education, but almost always it's simply a facade that a mere scratch uncovers that there is no real thinking behind your contentions.
You obviously do not understand fully the concept of rights, since it is merely where my rights begin that yours end... and the community agrees on what those rights are.  The consensus of the community is the basis for my right to property, and whatever you may argue about a non-existant civilization does not prove your point in the least.
I think therefore I am, I have property therefore it exists, I have rights therefore yours begin where mine end.  I assume next you will argue nihilism as proof that I have no rights because we cannot even be sure we exist ourselves?

Money printing = increase money supply.
It's worse than that. 
If 95% of the real money is lent which increases the money supply, and then that money buys a house, and the guy that sold the house puts the money in the bank, and that forms the basis of the next money supply increase, etc etc etc.
Eventually you have a gargantuan house of cards that nobody could speculate how much real money is out there. We know it's a lot less than 5%.

@_date: 2014-03-28 10:50:11
Yes, that's right.  But I was talking about divisibility just for the sake of pointing out that we will not run out of currency to put into people's hands.
I did not mean to suggest that divisibility was the only problem, nor that dividing a bitcoin in and of itself affected the value of bitcoin, because obviously dividing a bitcoin would have no effect on the value of it.  It just means you can always use a smaller peice of one, if needed, to buy a sandwich.
Deflation has other effects - and I agree that the other effects are perhaps the more important issues to discuss.  The effect on hoarding and credit are probably the only serious arguments against bitcoin.  
However, this is where we need to separate fear from reality, and fair from unfair.  
Fear from reality:  Did we have a credit crunch because of deflation? No. The government gave the banks free money for years, letting them loan to ANYONE at any price!  This is what the current money system had allowed through INflation over the last 10 years through fractional reserve.
People couldn't afford the free/cheap credit that the fiat system allowed! Surprise!  That's what happens when you give money away to people who can't afford to even make the payments.  
Then what did they say?  "We need EVEN MORE INFLATION" to fix the credit crunch now that nobody is paying their mortgage.  If you don't give us a bunch more money, the entire system will collapse.
  Well, they are talking about the fiat system collapsing.
How did they fix it?  TRILLIOns in quantitative easing.  Ok, so now we don't have a credit crunch and we still have a fiat dollar *whew*  lucky us.
Inflation saved the day!  
Well, it also got us into the mess.  And, we aren't out of the woods yet.
 What if banks had simply loaned money the NORMAL WAY.  Then they would have been giving loans to people that QUALIFY to pay them back, and we wouldn't have seen a massive default, and we wouldn't have had a credit crunch.  
Inflationary monetary policy through fractional reserve in a fiat system is what created the credit crunch.  On the other hand, we would have never had all these crazy money shortages if we had been using a real currency all along.
Now... Is inflation FAIR?  ask yourself: who benefitted from all the inflation?  THE BANKS benefitted.  BANKS benefit from fiat inflation.  It is LITERALLY an upward redistribution of wealth, but they've somehow convinced academia this is a good thing.
I gotta tell you, it does seem to make sense that inflation us good.  It really seems to fit as a solution in a lot of scenarios.  But like so many things, what seems good on paper and how it works in practice are two different things and we should never forget that.
Inflation is not fair to people.  A man named Alan Watts spoke about the economic surplus created by automated manufacturing and lamented about how robots were supposed to free humanity from work.  But how do you allot all that economic surplus fairly to each individual?
The answer is by holding a real currency, such as bitcoin, that's not being inflated by central bankers.  Inflation just takes money out of your pocket, man.  
That's how the central bankers siphon all surplus economic output and keep it for themselves.  Why should the 1% get all the benefit of economic surplus?  We should all get that benefit.  That's fair.
Also, deflation would be rather slow if we all used bitcoin. Bitcoin, as you know, is actually inflationary in terms of money supply (at the moment) but the demand is increasing exponentially which is causing the value to rise regardless...  It's also highly volatile due to the small liquidity pool at present.  But this is a short term situation, perhaps.  
IF the world pours into bitcoin and we reach a steady state, deflation will be muted.  Prices would be fairly steady. Just like in an inflationary world, prices are fairly steady.  The average joe doesn't even notice.  For investors, they would just consider the rate of deflation or inflation in their investments to make sure they make money long term.
Let's take a loan as an example: in an inflationary world, you take a 2% inflation rate, plus a 4% real interest rate to get a 6% nominal rate for a loan.  The 6% number is the number you would see advertised.  
In a deflationary world, say 2% per annum, it'd be similar.  You would take the 4% real rate, subtract 2% deflation, and get a 2% nominal rate.  2% is the rate you'd see advertised.  In both scenarios, the cost of the loan for the borrower is the same and the profit for the bank is the same.  That was not an example of a real loan, just an example of how the rate would be calculated.
Deflation is not such a bad thing.  HYPERdeflation would be bad, just like HYPERinflation is bad.  But BOTH of those /could/ happen in a fiat system too.  And both are Much less likely in a hard currency system such as bitcoin because people are less likely to have sea changes in confidence.

Deposits are not insured against drops in value.
According to the FDIC, only individual depository institutions are insured. A depositor will receive up to $250,000 of losses covered, if one of the covered banks goes under.
If the entire system collapses, or if your dollar decreases in value - there's no insurance for that.
Hoarding bitcoins provides benefit to bitcoin holders, not the economy in general.  Nothing wrong with that.  That being said, there will always be savers and spenders and ways to hoard value outside of an inflationary fiat system.

Well, we don't know exactly how much money printing they do or don't do, ultimately.  Ultimately, in the fiat system, when it's all said and done it comes down to people's perception and faith that everything will be OK.
Anyway - as far as bitcoin, we don't have to have blind faith.  For example, there's been no Fed audit... people are scared what they'd find.  With Bitcoin we won't have that.
And obviously we don't absolutely know if deflation would be predictable, but my hope and expectation is this:  If everyone in the entire world is using one currency for transactions, trade, and savings - you will not have capital flight in and out of that currency like you do now between currencies and certain asset classes.   That must provide some level of stability heretofore unseen... deflation, yes... but I doubt it would be dramatic.

What is the intrinsic value of a Jackson Pollack?  
What's the intrinsic value of used fryer oil?  It has none unless you also have equipment to clean it and a diesel engine to run it in.
Not only is value external (what it can do for YOU) but it's also market based (what it can do for YOU compared to other things or as a result of other factors)
What is the value of a dead and putrid animal?  It has none... In fact you might think it's a hazard.

I would agree with that.  But it's exactly that vested interest that will drive Bitcoin forward, and as more and more people have a vested interest, the network effect is going to drive adoption, leading to an increase in value which will also drive adoption.  Those people with a vested interest aren't just going to walk away... and the cryptographic computing power is what is protecting their investment. So, in a way, that will not convince grandma but it will convince those who are looking to invest and understand that the cryptographic computing power is what will prevent the network from being overtaken.

You're right, I have it backwards.  The way it was described on the website confused me.  Doing it on paper helped.
Anyway, my point is that in an inflationary economy if you set the nominal rate at 15%, and you have 4% inflation, your real rate is 11%.
To get the same real rate in a deflationary economy, just set the nominal rate at 7% and you have the same 11% real rate.  
That's what I've been trying to say.

Considering the network effect: what I find most interesting in trying to gauge the fundamentals of Bitcoin is surveys dealing with who has "heard about bitcoin", or if they "know what bitcoin is", or do they "have any bitcoin".  
By far, most people haven't even heard of it.  This means there's huge growth ahead in my mind.  Another factor is the even handed media coverage of late, and the regulatory clarity that's forming.  This leaves room for Bitcoin to grow in many places because as people hear about it, they are much more likely to hear positive or even-handed information about it when they do.

You're comparing timeframes with different economic factors.
It'd probably be easier to just look at pre 1971 vs post 1971, because that truly ended the gold standard and offers striking contrasts in context with the modern world, modern trade politics, etc.

Perhaps, if we stick to potatoes it will help out.  Banks want potatoes, not BTC.  They want the oil, the gold, the real estate.  Not the BTC.  Nobody wants BTC... they want the potatoes.  That's CRITICAL to understand.  What's important is value.
You want value, I want value - banks want value, everyone wants value.. not money.  So lets stick to potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 1BTC can buy you 104 potatoes
That's 4% deflation. The BTC amounts never change, but their purchasing power does.
Banks want to increase their *VALUE* using money... so they want to get back 5% more potatoes, and they don't care how many BTC they get.  
So, with 4% deflation on 1BTC, now .96 BTC buys 100 potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 0.96BTC can buy you 100 potatoes
The bank wants to make a 5% profit which means .96 * 1.05  means they need 1.008BTC to clear a 5% profit

No it wouldn't really matter.  As long as there's nothing out there with more hashrate than we have.  It could go down, or up.  As long as there's nothing powerful enough out there to do hashing as fast as we can.
edit: It's probably important to note that I am speaking very loosely.  Specifically, the threat to be concerned about is whether or not someone gains control of something approaching 50% of the computing power on the network.  The most likely source of this would be mining pools colluding.  We would see that coming.  However, I can envision other scenarios that we wouldn't see coming.  So, more hashrate means it's harder for something to sabotage Bitcoin in a way that we would not see coming.

Well you didn't address anything I said, you simply repeated yourself. You have no evidence to suggest that the average person knows anything about inflation and that it would affect their spending habits.  You also have nothing to support the contention that inflation promotes SOUND investments... in fact if you think about it, it promotes investing for the sake of investing for the fear of losing all your money.  That's not sound investing or beneficial investment strategy.  That's urgency created for the sake of urgency.
Inflation is wealth transfer from all dollar holders to the central bank and the government.  Who benefits directly from the wealth transfer?  Not the middle class, not the poor.  
You can look at the fact that wages have been stagnant despite prices going up to see the effect of inflation and the upward distribution of wealth.  We are running out of people to buy the things because the middle class is disappearing.  
Inflation sounds good on paper, but in practice it benefits the 1%.  You should wake up.

Tally sticks. 
Rai stones. 
How most countries see it today is not necessarily how they will see it tomorrow. You can call anything money if you want.  I'm not trying to prove to anyone that it is money.  I am not trying to write regulation.  But it is money.  It's money whether you call it money or not. 
It is simultaneously other thing as well.
You can call it money, and a commodity, and a ledger.
You will be right on all three counts.
 But you are right - I absolutely promise you if you go around calling it money people will look at you sideways.   
Call it a public ledger that can only be adjusted by following the rules, and cannot be falsified.  Instead of needing a bank to tell you how much money you have, you can use this central ledger.  
Call it "magical internet money". This diffuses the adversarial tone.  Then explain it is a ledger.  A bank is essentially a ledger, just like Paypal is a ledger.  Then talk about tally sticks and rai stones.  Bottom line, if you cannot corrupt the system it can be used as money.  Anything that /can be used as money/ *is* money.

MtGox was the top, now BTC-e is the top.  BTC-e allows leveraged bets.  We do not know if they have any money.

Let me clarify -  Currently, by dropping the double spend we are blinding the rest of the network instead of warning the rest of the network.
I'm suggesting propagating double spends.  This would make the network safer because wallet software would be able to warn the merchant when a double spend is seen on the network.   Instead of "unconfirmed" the transaction would move into a "suspicious" state in the wallet software.
After 10 minutes, it would either move into a "1 confirmation" state if it was accepted on the blockchain, or it would move into an "invalid" state if it was not accepted.
Now we would have relatively save 0 confirmation transactions for quick-serve and low-value scenarios.

I think there's a lot of truth in your statement.  
However, all companies and individuals are forced into investing (to some degree) due to the sense of urgency created by inflation.  
As long as inflation is a driver behind investment to some degree we will always suffer from some amount of short-terminism.
This relates to Bitcoin insofar as it is the only realistic potential competitor to centrally controlled fiat currency.
2-6% annual inflation is a very large number when calculated in a long term strategy.

Market value is not a combination of intrinsic value and extrinsic factors, that's the whole point man.  They can diverge such that intrinsic value = $100 and yet market value = $0.   You're either deliberately misunderstanding what everyone is trying to tell you or you're incapable of understanding it.
In other words, if it costs you $51 to make a ton of rock salt, that doesn't mean anyone is going to give a damn about your rock salt, much less pay you $51 dollars a ton for it.
THEREFORE - value is ACTUALLY a combination of extrinsic factors (usefulness) combined with market forces.  PERIOD.
Intrinsic value (cost to produce) ONLY tells you if it's worthwhile to produce more.  Will competition in a free market drive prices down toward intrinsic value?  YES... but that is NOT WHAT GIVES IT VALUE... and more importantly a free market will never "drive down" the price of an original Jackson Pollack, so to speak.  How much did it cost to produce it?  That will only tell you if it's worthwhile to produce a second *original* Jackson Pollack painting.  Maybe.  Bottom line: intrinsic value has limited utility in understanding value of many, if not most, items. 
 It's ABSOLUTELY NOT RELEVANT to understanding the value of fiat currency or bitcoin.  Yet - miraculously - both have value.

Reform will never happen from inside, no doubt about that...  
But... if bitcoin becomes the currency for world trade, that could change things from the outside - on a worldwide scale. 
 In fact, bitcoin is more likely to change the rest of the world before it changes the US (or other first world countries)
Even the UBS paper recognized that it will be readily accepted in countries that have weak or nonexistent banking systems.
Now consider: IF it changes the rest of the world, that means it could change the primary currency used for world trade (which is currently the USD)
 ...and if that happens.... 
well, now everyone in the first world will want bitcoins.

Yes, you're right.  For the time being, deflation will be extreme.  But that is the expected result and why it's such a great investment right now.  The people pushing it as a currency don't understand that, /for the time being/, it's better suited as an investment and commodity.  We need billions, if not trillions, more "dollars" in the value pool before it becomes extremely stable as a currency.  That being said, I do believe it should be expected to grow into use as a currency.
Ultimately, deflation is a result of simple supply and demand economics that affect all currencies.  Increased demand, limited supply, the price goes up - and you have deflation.
Therefore, eventually: once everyone on planet Earth has "bought in" that intends to "buy in".... at some point deflation should come to a plateau. And remain fairly stable and predictable in the rate of deflation.  
You see glimpses of this today whenever the price goes down, that is defacto inflation due to reduced demand.  Inflation and deflation all comes down to supply and demand and it's irrelevant if we are talking supply side (money printing) or demand side.  
Anyway, I do believe that day is far off...  (at least five years)   but predictability is the real heart of whether it can work as a currency - and ultimately I believe it will be predictable.

Exactly my sentiment.  Companies like Visa are really the better point of sale and escrow solution, today.  I do not see gas pumps and mcdonalds buying new point of sale infrastructure that works with QR codes.  Also, people like their credit cards.  That's the reality of the market.  The benefit to Bitcoin is instant market adoption into an existing ecosystem that people understand and know how to use.  Of course, people still need to be able to safely obtain and keep bitcoins - and that's a challenge that is being solved by legitimate players already in the market, and entering the market today - and will be further secured by multisig strategies.  I think it absolutely makes sense in the reality of the market today.  We can't put on rose colored glasses and ignore the challenges and in the process ignore the solutions.

Bitcoin is a way to store value.  It's not an altruistic effort to help the economy.  Economies are served by the collective effort of each individual going about serving their self interest. 
Bitcoin is in fact proof of that.  The miners build the network (which has real costs) in order to benefit from the value of the mined BTC and transaction fees.  If people did not continue to put value into the system, there'd be no incentive to mine and there'd be no network.  The entire bitcoin framework relies on human self interest. All parts are inseparable.
In fact, this is how the macro economy also functions.  Bakers do not bake bread for the love of bread, but to earn a living for themselves.
Hoarding bitcoins is natural and good for all bitcoiners.  If you want to spend them, fine.  But please also hoard them. :). Thanks!

I think in the beginning it made sense to start with a high value of bitcoin creation to get the bitcoins out there and get the whole thing started.   Then, you want to kinda taper-off... 
They had to find some way to start high and then lower the output over time.  But to me it doesn't make any sense to completely stop the production of BTC... but we won't see it stop until 2140, so I think by then we'll have built out the network completely and transaction fees should be just fine to keep it going.  By then we'll have other problems to worry about, like quantum computing or something crazy.  We might not even use money by then... who knows.

A loan can be structured in an inflationary or deflationary or steady state economy that makes sense for both the borrower and the lender.  In an inflationary economy, it's easy because the bank simply sets an interest rate on the loan that's a bit higher than inflation.  
So you're paying two things:  
1) Paying for inflation
2) Paying the bank for the loan
In a deflationary economy, you aren't paying for inflation. 
The bank would still make money using an interest rate.. but they would also be making money on the deflation, because if the principal is static and you are paying off the load with deflated dollars, then they are at a great advantage.
So you would want the principal to adjust downward based on a consumer price index, or perhaps a simple interest YIELD (in your favor) to compensate for deflation and also leave something on the table for the bank.
Or something like that.
IT CAN BE DONE.

Bitcoin is software than can be improved without disrupting the network, and is being improved.  Worst case scenario, with a block chain fork, the effect would be analogous to a power outage.  It would be fixed and everyone would still have their Bitcoins (except the few that got caught in the fork).  And that's really stretching things. But there's your worst case, IMO.

Meaning is to words what value is to an object...  Same thing.. Value is what's in your head.  It's "what it can do for you." But it's always external to the object, just like meaning is external to words... 
If intrinsic value were a viable theory, bitcoin nor the fiat dollar would have value.  Bitcoin is at $450 because the buyers and sellers in the market *right now* are comfortable with that price. Likely, because most of the sellers bought for less than $450 therefore it's a good price for them - and the buyers think $450 is a low price for the future.  
We don't know what the people on the sidelines are thinking.. They might be thinking that they will never sell until it hits $1000... We don't know.  And if so, it would be fair to state that Bitcoin "will be worth $1000" but today it's worth $450.
That's it.  
People trust that bitcoins will not vanish and that they will serve some sort of a purpose.  Throw in market dynamics: and that's its value.

He was pre-loading the hidden private keys of the bitcoins with 1 BTC, therefore he was effectively converting fiat into BTC.  That makes him a money transmitter.

FinCEN will regulate anything that can be used to facilitate wealth transfer... including products.  
IRS has two primary categories:  currency or product.  Everything falls into one of those categories, and only currency that is declared as legal tender by a government will be classified as currency by the IRS. If we can get bitcoin declared as legal tender by any jurisdiction that the IRS recognizes, then bitcoin will become a currency.  Until then, it's a product as far as the IRS is concerned. 
Gold is considered a product according to the IRS, and it is also regulated by FinCEN as money.

My first thought was that this sounds like a great idea.  
However, then I realized that if everyone is part of a single distributed mining pool, then we'd have no way to cut off an attack.  At least with independent mining pools, we know what to target if they are doing something fishy... 
With distributed mining, a mining pool couldn't collude to attack the network, but that would still allow a virus or super large organization to control a high percentage of mining equipment... of course a virus or organization is still a threat to the current system, so my point is simply that distributed mining doesn't really solve that problem entirely.
Ok, so what about this:  Integrate mining pool server, payout rules, and miner membership into the protocol.  All mining power must be part of a pool defined in the bitcoin protocol.  Anyone can create a pool, with whatever payout rules, and anyone can join any pool, but now we have deep visibility into the power of pools and this makes detecting and blocking bad pools more viable... through various methods.
This definitely leads to disincentivising membership in a pool that is approaching a certain percentage because their blocks would be much more likely to be rejected... anyway, just thinking out loud.  I'm no expert.

What is their funds availability policy for cash?  
Also I would agree this seems to be something that they should cover.
Even if it is their policy to give back the cash, if requested, the guy still made an unauthorized withdrawal from your account.  
This isn't like going into walmart and getting a refund as long as you have the receipt - it's literally an unauthorized withdrawal from your account.    This is why you do not need ID to make a deposit, but you need ID to make a withdrawal... because only the account holder can make withdrawals (or an authorized agent)  -- So that's their choice to give back the cash.  They should cover it.  It sounds like a bullshit policy.  
Another bullshit policy is charging non-account holders to cash a check written on an account at the bank.  A check is an instrument that orders the bank to pay you the cash on demand.  They cannot embezzle a fee out of that.  If they want to charge anyone a fee, they would need to charge the account holder, not the named recipient.  I've called bullshit on this policy before and not payed the fee.  Banks are shit institutions.

Except you just said that value and cost to produce are the same, now you acknowledge they can diverge.  Either they can or they can't!  Intrinsic value theory says they can't.   It's wrong.  Stop trying to make excuses for it.
You dismiss the value of gold as speculation.  In fact it's not speculation, it's supply and demand market forces.  If nobody wanted gold for money, and nobody wanted it for dental, and nobody wanted it for jewelry, and nobody wanted it for electronics, it's value would be $0.  
Bitcoin has gone to $0, and come back. Why?  Immutability.  They don't evaporate, just like gold does not evaporate.
You and Ptolemy would be great friends.  The intrinsic model is much like the geocentric model.  Explains *almost* everything.

Ok, perhaps that's what he means..
It definitely has first mover advantage. But Bitcoin is not a company, and it had no intentions.
Instead, it's market is whatever people want to use it for.  People choose to use it as a currency, therefore it is one.  It's not a payment system.  It can simply be transmitted easily, unlike other currencies, which makes it resemble a payment system.  PayPal, money orders, checks, western union, etc, have no ability to actually transmit money.  They simply have a central ledger but it requires a bank or cashier to ultimately finalize the process.  Bitcoin is nothing like that.

The Chinese people have immense faith in their financial system. That's why Chinese banks put stacks of cash on display to reassure customers of their deposits.  Their immense faith explains why the Chinese people run to the banks at the slightest hint of cash shortages.
Obviously there's no way they could possibly get Bitcoins if the banks don't interface with Bitcoin exchanges, and certainly by banning it that would make Chinese people want it less considering their faith in the Yuan.
No.

The bank can structure the loan however they want to assure a profit that is reasonable for the lender as well as the borrower.  In an inflationary world it's easy because they just set an interest rate that is higher than inflation.  In a steadily deflationary world, they could simply set the principal to decrease at a fair rate.
That's the easy way.  Another way is to set an interest rate that represents the bank's profit, and peg the principal to a consumer price index that allows the principal to grow or shrink based on the true value.
This is definitely possible.  The only question is creating the loan product by writing up the contract in a way that benefits both borrower and lender.  It's really that simple.

If you define "the economy" as people lending money to do things, then yes - it would not be fast, loose and absolutely irresponsible like it is today.   But the world doesn't need to run up insurmountable debt in order to do everything.  
Savings, credit cards, VC and angel investing plays a much bigger role than bank loans in starting businesses because a bank will not loan any money to an as-of-yet non-existent business.
There's all kinds of credit out there for daily operations - including peer-to-peer credit in the form of NET 15, NET 30, NET 90.  
If a business person learns to hold savings in a deflationary currency for what he WOULD HAVE used a line-of-credit for, then instead of paying interest and being a slave to the bank (like the poor farmers who need banks just to plant seeds) then he will be *making money on savings* instead of losing it to wealthy bankers and able to handle his business without the need of a bank.
You argue that rents give money to the wealthy, but somehow you argue that interest payments do not evaporate the middle class and centralize wealth?  How absolutely twisted!
  Inflation robs from all holders of the currency in order to profit those who the bankers and government favor.   
Deflation is less of an enemy to the average man - it empowers him and requires him to manage his finances responsibly, which is in direct competition to the bankers desires to always have the average man enslaved.   Inflation is enslavement no different than rents are enslavement.

Perhaps, if we stick to potatoes it will help out.  Banks want potatoes, not BTC.  They want the oil, the gold, the real estate.  Not the BTC.  Nobody wants BTC... they want the potatoes.  That's CRITICAL to understand.  What's important is value.
You want value, I want value - banks want value, everyone wants value.. not money.  So lets stick to potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 1BTC can buy you 104 potatoes
That's 4% deflation. The BTC amounts never change, but their purchasing power does.
Banks want to increase their *VALUE* using money... so they want to get back 5% more potatoes, and they don't care how many BTC they get.  
So, with 4% deflation on 1BTC, now .96 BTC buys 100 potatoes.
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes.
Year 1: 0.96BTC can buy you 100 potatoes
The bank wants to make a 5% profit which means .96 * 1.05  means they need 1.008BTC to clear a 5% profit

The main problem with the argument, is that if the network is not used to store, move and gain value - then there is no incentive for the network to exist, because people must spend quite a bit of value on maintaining the network.  It is a logical fallacy to separate the two, in practice.

You seem to be more interested in discussing definitions of words, rather than communicating.  In other words, you're more interested in reiterating the barriers of semantics than breaking them down into their underlying concepts.  
You seem to be more attracted to making vague appeals to authority, and seem more attracted to repeating things that you've read, rather than engaging in thought and pushing the bounds of what you already know and believe.
Look - I understand that you have your position, and you're entitled to it as am I mine, and you can defend it however you wish - but if you insist on that method then I might as well simply read the books that you've read and bypass the whole conversation process altogether since the fidelity of the information in that case will be truer.  
Rather, I'm interested in communication and original thought which requires flexibility in semantics and it requires pushing the bounds of what you and I already know, which requires a *great deal* of flexibility in semantics and pre-existing ideas in the course of conversation.
If we merely regurgitate already formed concepts and defined words, then how are we to learn anything new?  Again, I might as well just read a book and build my thoughts around those of other men using words as defined by others.  In the end, I will know their ideas very well, perhaps.  But, again, I am more interested in discussion and expansion of ideas.
If you don't investigate the source of meaning of each and every word that you use, it's rather easy to get caught in a circular trap of logic.  For example, might is right.  Ok, that rhymes.  
In Chinese, for example, might and right is often the same concept.  However, power in Chinese also means "in one's hand", "to have", "to grasp"...  
However, if we look at rights in chinese we see the combination of power with interests:  
Do you see the circular nature of the words?   It is a web of interconnectedness that is very useful for daily life, but not very useful for discussion of the words and concepts themselves.
So I think if you start digging around in the confusion of language in your head you will realise that the words you use are the most blunt objects to discuss anything... and if you are not willing to maintain flexibility in communication then you will run around in circles without ever discussing anything while convincing yourself that you have indeed discussed a great deal.
Chinese is a facinating language, and I don't claim to know it.  But for example, the word for idiot is a mouth on top of the symbol for a tree.  From this do we conclude that all conversation is idiocy?  No. Do we conclude that anyone speaking loudly from a high position is an idiot?  No.  But, perhaps a Chinese person may think this? His word for idiot is clearly conflating the two.
And I think that there are many words in Chinese like this that show us that our words can confuse the discussion of anything.  The point is that our words define our thoughts, and they also confuse the discussion of them.  
English is no different.  If you try to discuss the essence of an idea, it's virtually impossible to use those same words to do it... so you must be willing to be flexible in conversation. 
Using the chinese word for "right" as an example, could we suggest that "right" is mere ability to excersise interest? I think at its essence that my believe is actually very similar (read: similar, not exactly the same) to this chinese word.  
As a man alone if I have merely the interest to hold food and eat it, do I have property?  If I eat it do I have power?  Does the fact that I ate it mean that I have the right to eat it?  I would argue yes on all three counts.  But does that mean desire begat property and power begat right?  Or did desire begat right and power was simply the inherent ability unopposed by another?
What happens when you take the interest or desire of two individuals and put them in conflict?  One man's perfect desires against another man's perfect desires?  The opposite of my rights are your rights.  Somewhere in the middle, we compromise.  Power may be involved in the compromise and affect that compromise.  From this activity we develop concepts such as right and wrong, or legal rights. 
 But ultimately, you must be flexible in your use of words otherwise you cannot discuss the origin of the concepts.  Power is merely the excersize of inherent rights that you have IF you are unopposed by others.  
You have to ground yourself somewhere in conversation, that's true, but it's also very dangerous to assume that you've actually done it.  At first, you must determine the origin of property before expanding to higher concepts such as morals and law.  And therefore we must agree on the most basic desires of man. To do this, we must look inward.  Inward we will not find power since power is external to our mind therefore it cannot be the source of property since we haven't established the motivator of the power if not for the property that already exists in our mind.  The mind is where we must begin... 
I would argue with one man you can have property simply because I have the desire. Because I have the desire I then act upon it.  That the action is merely the external representation of my desire.  Therefore my desire is the ownership.  I therefore own with the most basic of instinct:  hunger.
Power is merely my ability to effectuate my desire, or the lack of opposition to the effectuation of that desire... does power therefore equal *legal or moral* rights?  Well if we are to agree that mere ability is a legal right, then yes.  But ability and law are not the same otherwise the theif would be right... so yet again it's circular.  Might is not right.
Bottom line, I'm just asking you to think a bit more about it.  Maybe you come to the same conclusion... maybe not.
Anyway, you might find this interesting:

Seriously, it's not a secret that money can be counterfeited.
Inflation, quantitative easing, debt spending - these are all colloquial terms for money printing.  Whether the govt. does it or criminals do it, it doesn't matter.  It's possible, it happens literally every day all day long, and it's well known.  
I'm sorry that you believe that this is a libertarian thing, but it's not.  Intentional inflation and money printing is actually a truth that is well understood at every level of society and is in fact endorsed by economists as a "healthy" thing...

Voting doesn't make a difference in regard to many issues because we use a fiat currency that allows them to print money and finance programs regardless of who we put into office.  
Ultimately, though, there will always be vote whores because they do have to win the election... So issues will be involved one way or another.
 If bitcoin takes off, then they will not be able to print money and votes will matter more.  It's all about the money.  With bitcoin, they would need a war tax to go to war instead of having endless wars financed by money printing.

Plain and simple, Bitcoin is not related to any tech bubble 2.0 because the technology has been on the minds of computer scientists for decades.  Tech bubble 2.0 is a different animal.
  See Byzantine generals problem:
The next logical conclusion to the above solution is digital currency, among various other proof of ownership or proof of identity scenarios.  We've long used public/private key cryptography for that - but never before has it been able to be decentralized.
Furthermore, Bitcoin is the most important "crypto" currently due to greater hashing power, which is very very expensive.  It's the "backing" that a viable digital currency needs.  It's what keeps the network secure.
  Bitcoin is not just a piece of software.  It's a huge hardware network.  It is it's own thing.

Right, but an investment is not money.  You can invest in money, but you can invest in things that are not money.  
For example, I can invest in Yuan using US Dollars..  Yuan might rise against my US Dollar.  I can use Yuans to buy things, or I can buy back my US Dollars after the rise.
When you buy stock, you are agreeing that someone will be able to *do something* with your money for some period of time.  In a 401k you are deferring taxes so that you can allow additional money to be put to use and grow further without taxation.
Bottom line, Bitcoin investing is similar to currency investing.  That doesn't make a 401k a bad idea.  You can even hold Bitcoins inside a 401k, if you want.

Simply put, you cannot value a stock like you value a currency or commodity.  They are not similar.
Currency/money is pure supply and demand and perception.  Fiat systems has other levers like QE, debt monetization, taxes, and interest rates that make things even more complicated.  Take a look at forex markets.  Currency valuation is virtually impossible.

Yeah, I definitely did not and would not advocate "investing" in Yuan.  In fact, you might argue that it's one of the worst currency investment choices out there, currently.  
I also agree that investing in currencies is absolutely much more risky than stocks... if you're already holding US dollars, that is.  If you are an Argentinian, you might want some US dollars.
That being said, while those statements may be true of currencies and stocks, Bitcoin is different in that its immunity to *supply side* manipulation make it act different than other currencies.  Many have described this aspect of bitcoin by comparing it more closely to commodity investment, such as gold.

Wow.  There are many errors in this article.  For one, they suggest a 51% attack could "destroy bitcoin".  It would, maybe, allow someone to complete a double spend and that would temporarily impact confidence but not destroy bitcoin.  Miners would react and join a new pool, and so would the rest of us react as appropriate, and nobody would lose a single bitcoin.
Also, they say that there is no way to stabilize the money supply as with fiat - sure there is: as adoption plateaus, so will volatility.
Also, this idea that anyone would build a payment network for banks and the visas of the world using bitcoin technology is born out if a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin survives today.  And even if they did that, we would still use bitcoin... 
I'm only on the second or third page.  But the most interesting thing is that they absolutely consider it a serious threat to value storage.  
Edit: value storage (ie deposit banking)
Edit again:  and then they go on to give a full bitcoin tutorial.  Brilliant stuff.
They truly do not seem to feel threatened by bitcoin.  The believe the emerging market distrust of banks will lead to increased bitcoin adoption, but do not see that as playing a role in the adoption of the first world.  Obviously, that is a very micro viewpoint.   At a macro level, worldwide adoption would threaten the currency used for worldtrade.  If everyone uses bitcoin for world trade, then THAT would affect banks in the first world because now you don't need a bank to store your currency, not because people distrust banks.

The point I’ve been trying to make is that in an inflationary economy if you set the nominal rate at 15%, and you have 4% inflation, your real rate is 11%.
To get the same real rate in a deflationary economy, just set the nominal rate at 7% and you have the same 11% real rate.
That's what I've been trying to say., but using different terms.  The point is that you can structure a loan, when all factors are considered, to make a profit for the lender, and the borrower would borrow if they thought they could benefit from the loan.  This is how it has always worked.  The idea that it cannot work in a deflationary world is simply a misunderstanding in regard to how interest is calculated and ignores the fact that deflation is simply one variable in the overall equation.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:11:19
I think they don't understand that inflation and deflation is simple supply and demand economics.  It doesn't matter if you have increased supply (money printing) or decreased demand you will have inflation.  Vice versa for deflation. 
Ergo - a plateau in demand is a plateau in deflation if you have a static money supply.

Firstly, A is not true - inflation is limitless.  The banks role
Is to try to keep it in a "band" or range that is supposedly "healthy" for the economy but there's no guarantee that the monetary tools will work in all scenarios.  Fiat money is fiat money, after all.  Over time any wealth kept in the fiat system will evaporate.  A pound from 50 years ago might buy X, but today buys X * 0.10.   So, I guess you could say there is a "limit" but that limit is by choice.  It is a choice the central bank makes.  They use complex monetary tools like taxation, Quantitative Easing (money printing), and interest rates and so forth to try to inflate or deflate the money supply in order to TRY to make their choice a reality in the economy.  Doesn't always work.  
B) It is true that there is nothing inherent in Bitcoin, or any other currency or store of value that necessitates its rise in value.  Rather, it is human nature COMBINED with limited supply that causes this.  Like a rising stock value or any other thing of limited supply that can store and cause wealth to grow, people will gravitate toward that object of value /when they see the price rising/:  
So, in that regard, since you suppose right that Bitcoin competes with all currencies and Altcoins compete not with Bitcoin, but with all currencies, there is no reason to suppose that any currency will succeed except the one that is limited in supply, well known, and rising in value, because people will gravitate toward it.
Edit: basically, I'm saying that Bitcoin is going to the moon.

It's amazing how few people are aware of the most important event of our century in regard to finance, and ultimately freedom.  1971, Nixon actually took us off the gold standard.  People think a floating paper currency is an old thing, but it's not.  It's 40 years old.
Previously, paper represented a fixed quantity of gold.  It ceased being redeemable for gold a while back, but its value was pegged to gold until 1971, and yes that really does matter.  This current floating system is a new and fast failing experiment, but nobody seems to be aware of that fact.

I agree that rights are allowances from those in power, but it's obviously more complicated than that since we have endless examples of people rising against oppressive powers when the *granted rights* do not conform to what the *community believes is right*.  Therefore I believe rights, ultimately, derive from the consent of the governed, and this is certainly what you might equate with "American" thinking, however I believe this is a universal thought among men. Obviously your effective rights are going to be somewhere on a sliding scale between oppression and consent.  This is why we have a *republic* here in America, and a balance of powers so that there is competition in government among the states and local governments and branches of government, and other levers, so that government can be brought back in line with the consent of the governed.   
But that's fine, we can leave rights out of it...  because I agree rights do not have anything to do with whether property exists.  But I'm not so sure that you are able to separate rights from property in your argument.  You continue to use terms such as "restricting others from a thing" in order to create property in your mind.  In other words, you're discussing rights when you say "restricting others"  you are discussing relationships.
So let's leave rights out of it.  Rights are relationships between people.  If we are to leave rights and relationships out of the conversation, then we must discuss a single person.
Can a single person own something?  We do not need anthropological records to tell us the answer to this.  For all we know, they were communists that disliked their manner of living and were forced to live that way by their oppressive governments.  Probably not, but we cannot know.  Anthropological records from our ancient past are useless to discussing philosophy, ultimately, anymore than the anthropological records of China would be useful to philosophical discussion of rights 1000 years from today..
We cannot discuss other civilizations and avoid the discussion of rights and relationships and politics, so let's talk about a single person.
Can a single person protect an item from sun , rain, or fire?  Can he protect meat from the ravages of time by preservation using smoke and salt?
What force drives a single person to take something in their hand and protect it of not the sense of ownership?

If you type "academic papers on" into google, "on bitcoin" turned up first in google suggestions, and lead to plenty of results.  I see the wiki has a list, I saw something from Princeton.
There are things Bitcoin needs to fix, but one person's lack of imagination is not proof that the failure to find a solution is inevitable.

Well, this is where things get somewhat complicated, I suppose.  
And really it all depends on what your definition of USD is.  Did the dollar exist before the federal reserve was created in the early 1900s?  Did it exist after the bank runs 1929?  If you think it did then why did they order all citizens to deliver their gold to the federal reserve in 1933 and prohibit its use as a currency, despite constitutional protections otherwise?  
Is it the same dollar today than it was in 1971 when Nixon took us off the gold standard and allowed its value to float freely, ending Bretton Woods?  Is it the same dollar now than before 2008?  If we weren't operating as Keynesian since 1971, we're sure as hell Keynesian now.  Do you have a Keynesian dollar?  KSD?  
 So one could argue that it's the same USD for all these years, but you could also absolutely argue that it's a different form of money when you change the rules.  Did we change the rules in 1933?  What about 1971?  What about 2008?
Let's say, for the sake of argument that it's the same USD.
Now the USD is the primary instrument of world trade.  If any other currency weakens, where do people go?  They go to the dollar.   But keep in mind, nobody likes running to the Dollar, they'd rather not have to run at all.  And they don't like the power that this gives the American government.  I for one, don't think this is a problem since I am American, but obviously the entire world disagrees with me.    And that matters because the rest of the world is looking for alternatives.  Let's say Bitcoin challenges the USD's position as the primary instrument of world trade.  
That would mean people run to Bitcoin.  If they are running to Bitcoin, they are not running to the USD.  They are running away.  This is essentially a bank run.  What does the Fed do to solve this?  They cannot solve such a massive problem, because they cannot change the rules of Bitcoin.  Therefore they are ineffective.  They have no gold to steal this time.
That doesn't mean the USD goes away - it's value will obviously change.  We may need to re-print all the money using a new denomination.  1,000,000 may become 1USD.     Is it the same USD?  No, not really..  but we'll call it a USD.

Very smart guy.  
Very interesting overall, however I disagree that economic energy created by a robot should be credited to all of humanity through the accounting of a unit of some sort.  
Rather, this already exists.  It's called money.  This would automatically occur if we used a non-inflatable currency such as bitcoin.  This is in fact the very heart of the evil of fiat currency: that all economic growth is siphoned out of the system by the central bankers rather than being evenly distributed to all holders of the currency.   We have the solution in our hands today: it's bitcoin.
Now, making people comfortable with reducing prices and reducing pay as the value of a bitcoin increases... this is the real challenge.

The article was exasperating about why nobody has got the message about intrinsic value having been disproven even though it's been about 100 years since the intrinsic theory of value was disproven.  The article was written in 1969, so it's been about 145 years now.  Here's some slightly better discussion about the details: 
Regardless, I think the most important thing for you to examine is that you're using the terms intrinsic and extrinsic as they are meant in philosophical arguments.  To the extent that you are discussing value in regard to philosophy, you are generally correct, I suppose...
However, in economics value ultimately gives you a dollar amount, so to speak.  Additionally, those two terms don't mean the same thing in economics.
  - "Intrinsic value theory" means labor value, or cost to produce.  It argues that the "baked in" efforts or value (dollar amount, again) are what ultimately lead to the price.  The problem with this theory is that there are many "dollar amounts" that can never be explained with it, so it's not complete.
  - "Use value/market value" means your subjective value (philosophical value) of an object for whatever reasons (intrinsic or extrinsic philosophical value) *combined with* market dynamics is what ultimately leads to value (dollar amount)
Will the "cost to produce" (intrinsic value) affect it's price? (Market value)   Yes, in many scenarios.  However, if I produced something for a cost of $50 and nobody is willing to pay more than $25, I will accept the $25 in order to cut my losses.  
I hope that clears things up a bit.

Your question assumes that you can be wrong about value.  You cannot. I was trying to address that fact.
Cost does not determine value. Cost merely determines whether it's worthwhile to produce more of a something.
Edit:  You're conflating immediate value of a thing with predicting the value of a thing and the fact is is that the market dynamics in the future are unknown today.  Therefore you're talking about something different.

We can be certain that the most recent negative cycle was created by the supply manipulation. (Loose fractional reserve policies for the banks that created huge amounts of cheap credit.)
I'm also pretty sure that the twenties involved similar very loose monetary policies that lead to the loss of faith, 1929 crash, 1931 confiscation of gold, etc. They tried to fix that with QE as well.
Fixing too much cheap credit with gargantuan amounts of cheap credit?  How do two wrongs make a right?  I'm not sure this is going to work out the way economists are predicting on paper.  I understand that muted and predictable inflation sounds good on paper, and then if you have a credit crunch QE will loosen those markets...  and hopefully it all plays out... but in practice I think this idea is much more dangerous than allowing natural economic cycles to proceed.
We see central bank policies failing all over the world today, and we see them having failed in the past.  I do not see anything particularly unique about our central bank except that we are the primary reserve currency... which certainly grants us a position of leverage far beyond other central banks... but to what extent?  We are not immune from failure.
With a currency that's not subject to manipulation, we would have natural economic cycles.  Some good, some bad.  But we would NOT have debasement of the value of the currency.   Ultimately, in practice, we would have the same economic uncertainty as we do with fiat!  But no inflation, no upward redistribution of wealth...  
Sounds like an improvement to me.

Bitcoin is the perfect currency.  It is the first currency that is a pure money instrument that is not confused by industrial and recreational uses like gold, nor is it corrupted by central banks.  
It accurately represents value because it is only used for storing and transmitting value.  Alan Watts had an interesting idea that the automation of machines should be able to benefit all humans, if only we had a way to measure the economic output and deliver it to all people somehow.
This is now possible: a deflationary worldwide currency will automatically deliver all economic surplus to all holders of the currency.
The real issue with deflation is not our money, but our perception of lowering prices.  We need to get comfortable with lowering prices.

No, the point is that fiat/gold is money 1.0, bitcoin is money 2.0, and other crypts don't provide anything that bitcoin doesn't already provide and they aren't going to catch on very easily.
  Bitcoin can be upgraded to support additional features, and the ecosystem is evolving constantly.  I don't think there is a big market for unproven alternative cryptos.

What are miners thinking?  We might see this by looking at the "hashing rate" and "difficulty" and "market price" and correlating them.
I would suggest that when hashing rate goes down in response to prices going down, then miners are not willing to mine for that price and therefore you could suggest that means something.
So you tell me, how can you determine the value of anything?  You suggest that the future can be predicted.  Everyone knows that it cannot.

Oh I see where you're coming from.
I was just trying to explain the value side and how you would need to subtract deflation from the overall interest rate.
Yes, you're right that ultimately you would want to increase your total BTC from the lender's perspective since doing nothing would already get you 4% gain... but I was just trying to show that there's more value gain than it looks like initially.
There are alot of other factors when considering to lend.  If I can make more money elsewhere, say 10% a year, then I'm going to want to charge more to loan you the money.  Maybe 15% interest, and then subtract 4% deflation - and you get a 9% interest rate.. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:47:36
Because you bought for $100, you are not likely to sell for less than $100 without a good reason. 
Circumstances may change, that doesn't mean you were wrong. 
 The fact that value changes based on external factors is ultimately why it's more useful to understand value in extrinsic terms.

Hmm... and now the IRS suddenly believes making your own currency is simply income, not an illegal thing after all.  My my my..... how the government changes their stance when there's nobody to send to jail and no office to shut down and no coins to seize.

I am certain that it would not be "trivially easy" to ban as you suggest.

No, you're right - the rate would need to be much higher for it to make sense... but my point is that you would need to subtract the deflation rate from the interest rate... but yeah, if theres 5% deflation, then at a minimum your interest rate is going to be over 5% for a loan.

Balance sheet.   That's a good one.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:35:37
* 1a.  You are correct, gold is immutable.  So is dirt.  Immutability is important, but it does not give it value.  It gives it trust.  Bitcoin is effectively immutable as a result of its highly distributed nature.  The blockchain is stored on thousands of computers and can be independently verified by any one computer.  This makes it effectively immutable.
* 1b.  Gold, nor anything else, has intrinsic value.  "Intrinsic value" is a shorthand term used by laymen to understand money, but it is effectively meaningless in an academic sense.  The quicker you shed this absolutely false notion, the sooner you might begin to understand money.  The easiest example of this is art and diamonds - two things with value completely beyond any "intrinsic" purpose .  Another thought experiment is fryer oil.  This is something that fast food restaurants consider garbage that they will pay to have removed from their premises, however the ability for the do-it-yourselfer to run a diesel engine off of oil creates a situation where the market has now given used frier oil a positive value somewhere below the price of refined diesel, but certainly higher than garbage.  You could not have predicted this with an equation, because it is the market that gives everything value.  People give it value.  Value is always external, never intrinsic.  If gold were not used as money, and gold fillings went out of style, and the vanity of jewelry were no longer fashionable, you could not tell me in the million ways that people perceive gold what its value will be tomorrow.  The fact is that nothing has value except what the market dynamics place upon it and market dynamics are mathematically infinite.
What bitcoin has, like everything else, is some kind of usefulness for some purpose.  Value is built around that by market dynamics, and is a hell of a lot more complicated than you're trying to make it.  Eventually people will determine what moves the bitcoin price, but like everything else it will be an estimate, not a sure thing.
* 2a. If people lose faith in the currency you will have a bank run because people want to get their money out before everyone else does.  This is so that they can buy gold, another currency, real estate, or bitcoin with their fiat before its value goes down completely.  People intuitively understand basic market dynamics in regard to currency.  They know that the sooner you get your money out, the better.  This is not conjecture, this is fact.  Do you watch the news?  This just happened in Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina and Venezuela and is happening in China.  This ALSO happens if people lose faith in a particular bank.
* 2b.  Traditional currencies have the same value as bitcoin.  Whatever value is put into the system or taken out.  If you have bank runs, aka currency runs, the value plummets just like with bitcoin.  If you have a loss of faith, then people will sell at unreasonably low prices (less than what they put into it) causing a drop in price.  All currencies or stores of value work exactly the same in this regard.  Market dynamics.  Supply and demand.
* 3.  The answer will be both.  Merchant acceptance via instant conversion to fiat does not directly add value to the system, but it does add some legitimacy and notoriety.  The net effect of that will grow the ecosystem.  People using it as a speculative investment will also drive the price higher, which will likely tempt others into investing more.  Ultimately, this is real value put into the system, and its *effective* immutability means that although perceived value will fluctuate, the bitcoins will never go away and if the price sufficiently drops, there will likely be buyers willing to buy at that price.  Eventually buy pressure will overcome sell pressure because everyone knows that do you not lose your investment until you sell the item.  I believe this will happen in 6-month cycles (based on what history has shown us) as people say to themselves "Holy shit, that stupid bitcom thing is still around.. maybe there's something to it.  What?  $500?  Christ.  How do I get a bitcom?"

Anytime a new search engine came out everyone jumped ship.  Bitcoin is nothing like that.  Bitcoin competes with all currencies, so to suggest that first mover advantage applies here is ridiculous.

Regardless, those passwords (like all digital information) will always need to be stored somewhere... and digital information is always stored physically.  
Whether that be an SSD drive, magnetic harddrive, or paper.  It's all physically stored somewhere.
But anyway, good joke.

I'm curious - you are one of the few people that have drawn the same conclusion that I have:  that true quality of living increases are being "siphoned off" as a result of the inflation.  In other words: real wages have essentially been flat despite economic output having increased... 
And of course this forces one to ask themselves: Who is benefitting?  This isn't what's supposed to occur in practice, according to the economists.   
What led you to that realization that inflation is having the above described effect in practice?

By your argument all property, state owned or private owned, has no basis in philosophy.
I would argue that the existence of property is self evident and one therefore must only argue by whose right it is to keep. 
Since the personal desire to keep property exists among all men naturally, then it is only the desire for state ownership that requires "might" to make right, and for private ownership "might" *is my right*.
I have the right to be sure in my home and effects.
We believe these truths to be *self evident*.   They are universal, as I said originally.  Your argument simply attempts to confuse the *obvious truth* with convoluted and false yet rational-seeming thought that ultimately seeks to dilute freedom for the sake of state power.
You might as well suggest that color has no basis in philosophy and the sky is therefore not blue.  It's fucking absurd.
What you're talking about is religion since it requires faith in an unseen item, and I'm talking about serious politics that all men want.

Value and money are separate things.  A good analogy is meaning and words. 
 Value is in your head, as meaning is in your head.  Money is the thing that you can use, like words, to represent that value.
How is the value of a thing determined? Supply and demand market dynamics. 
If you want to buy a bitcoin, someone will have to be willing to sell you a bitcoin.  That price is the price that you both think it's worth.  If the price is $500 at the moment, and there's no sellers at that price - but you have buyers that want a bitcoin - then they will bid the price upward until someone is willing to sell a bitcoin.  Perhaps that happens at $501.76.  That's supply and demand in a nutshell.
That's how all markets work, and how all value is determined.  Bottom line, if you think a bitcoin is worth $700, then you're not going to sell unless someone offers you more than $700 for it.  That is the value that YOU placed on it.  
When you look at the price on an exchange, that represents the current price that all active buyers and sellers are currently agreeing on.  And it will move accordingly.
That being said... That is just the current spot price.  
At any given time you will also have a huge percentage of people on the sidelines that will not sell until the price reaches X value or Y conditions.  For example - myself - I will not be selling until the price is over $2500.  There may be many more people like me. But you will not see the price go to $2500 until all the people that want to sell at $450-2499 are done selling, and the buy pressure outweighs them causing the price to move up.
Ultimately, Bitcoin is worth what you think it's worth.

I am not separating them like a fool, I am simply not confusing them and conflating them.
Might doesn't make property - the decision in your mind makes property.  You're confusing theft with rightful acquisition.  As long as you continue to equate the two, then you will continue to argue that might creates property.  
It absolutely matters under what conditions the property is obtained.  The community decides what is right or not.  If anything is done according to community consensus, then it is right.  
If it is done contrary to that, then it is not right.  But might does not create property, and property would exist without might.  The decision in your mind that it is yours is what creates it.  The nomads owned the land, or at least believed that nobody owned it.  When confronted with usurpers, did they leave?  No, they fought.  Therefore they *had decided it was theirs* they just didn't have a formal concept of it as we do today.  
This was property like any other.  That was their land.  The forced acquisition did not create the property.  Might does not make right, rights are something you decide and form from community consensus.  The usurpers violated the nomadic communities sense of what was right.  Might *without right* is theft.  I do not think the usurpers thought that they were not stealing, I'm sure they realized they were stealing, hence the needs for weapons.  And the nomads fought eachother over territory as well.  
Property is as old as the first human.  Might defends it, or steals it, but it does not create it.  Our thoughts and desires, and community consensus do.

You are right in many regards, except your understanding of how much real value is siphoned off the fiat system by central banks' money printing (QE) activities.  To casually compare the Bitcoin and fiat systems in that regard is absolutely insane.  Bitcoin has an extremely limited supply compared to fiat. 
 Neither is gold completely limited in its supply.  But Bitcoin is the first that is limited in the supply (we will not discover a bunch of Bitcoins in the side of a mountain, like gold) and is able to be used as a currency (easily transportable, divisible) and is able to be transmitted without a middle man.

In many economies, people are forced to mail cash due to lack of
Bank access, and "fees" get taken out by postal workers.
Bitcoin to SMS gateways (text messages) will reach any of these people that don't have access to computers.  They will essentially have access to a global network (bitcoin network) that relies on huge first-world-economy investments, directly from the third world.
People need bitcoin.  From that foundation, Bitcoin will be unshakeable.

YES.  It's nice to see someone on here who understands that TRUE inflation is orders beyond because we don't know what *deflation would have been*.
The economic surplus from improved manufacturing has been stolen from us by the central banks and exported... People wonder: why has productivity increased but wages remained flat since 1971?  Fiat dollar.
The theft is staggering.
I can only assume economists think this is a good thing because they Learned economics, and they have books and facts...  But they never went beyond the knowledge to develop an *understanding* of economics and why inflation is really not good at all.  WHO ultimately benefits?  Not the average person.  It is absolutely an upward redistribution of wealth.  To the point of elimination of the middle class.

I absolutely believe that what you described is exactly the case.  
Something must happen to kick off the next set of dominos in the network effect.  Something happened in April 2013, something happened in Oct/Nov 2013, and I believe that something will happen in the future to kick off the next wave. 
For me, in November, I said to myself "Holy crap, that Bitcoin thing is still around?  Holy crap - they're $400?"  and I started reading about it and realized it's not a bunch of coins stored on people's computers, but a proof of work solution to the two general's problem and a decentralized ledger, etc, etc.  I read the wiki and so forth, and realized that there was an explanation for all my questions, and those answers made sense.
It was enough to make me feel comfortable putting money in the system.
I think others will have the same "holy crap" moment.   They might have heard some negative information about Bitcoin... but 6 months later when it's still around, they will get curious just like I did.
The network effect dictates that each wave will be bigger than the last.  That's something we can be pretty sure of... that is: if we're right about the network effect.

But bitcoin cannot be banned anywhere that the internet is generally allowing encrypted traffic because I can run bitcoin on a different port, or using Tor, or obfuscate the protocol to look like a jpg image download on a porn site. 
And even in places where the internet is "banned"... then we see mesh networks in these oppressive regimes completely circumventing government action.

The term miner is very effective in helping *miners* understand why they would want to mine, but not effective in describing the innovation of Bitcoin itself.  In other words, the term miner serves its purpose well.
...but too often the term miner is used in the most basic description of Bitcoin:  "Bitcoin is a digital currency that is created by "miners" who use computing power to ... blah blah blah"  Horrible!
This type of description is worthless in describing how Bitcoin works and we need to come up with something better, yet simple.

The network is indeed the innovation, but the currency application is what makes it work.  The currency application is what allows the network to function.  It's what provides the miners the incentive to mine.  Without that, the network would not be very useful because without the miners, it would not be secure and would not be able to pass messages.  There has to be real value in the network to make the network work.

And the federal reserve will have much more difficult time managing the money supply and convincing people to use USD.

I agree with you. I was just trying to understand the line of thought.  
I don't believe in technical analysis... but I find their astrological signs fascinating... and I think there's something to be said about the fact that if everyone believes the full moon is a bad omen, then it is.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
I find it more useful, though, to understand the fundamentals.  I do not believe fundamentals will predict the future, either, but if fundamentals are strong then it increases the chances of positive results.
So - if you have strong fundamentals, and strong chart signals, then you'll probably see the market move upward even more than without positive chart signals.   
In this case, I believe the network effect is the fundamental driver of Bitcoin, and it's strong.  How will that translate to a market value?  I have no idea.  I'm not selling my Bitcoins, though.

Yes, you *would be* right if intrinsic value theory was correct.  It's been disproven for almost 150 years.  As long as you continue to view the world in those terms then you will continue to miss the reason everyone around you is buying bitcoins.  smart people.
Fiat value is not "set by the government".  Its value floats freely against other currencies according to how currency traders value it.  This has been going on since 1971.
Commodities are traded similarly.  You cannot dismiss all trading as "speculation".  You cannot say that gold has intrinsic value, yet dismiss that it's actual value is well beyond the cost to produce.  Wheat is no different if the market suspects that gluten free is going to be a big thing, the value may go down regardless of cost to produce.
Ultimately, the cost to produce does not determine value.  Listen: the value determines whether people will produce it.  The value determines if it's worthwhile to produce the thing.  Intrinsic value theory  got it backwards.
When I buy a bitcoin for $500 I am not likely to sell it for less than $500.  It's really that simple.

Inflation/deflation is a matter of money supply on one side, and money demand on the other.  If demand plateaus once market saturation is more complete, then deflation will be muted.
Volatility is a matter of the size of the liquidity pool in relation to the average movement of value which can definitely reduce as market saturation greatly increases.
In other words, I think that bitcoin is maturing and in about 5-10 years, it will look much more stable, with muted deflation.
In regard to how bitcoin and why bitcoin works in practice, you have to look at human nature in juxtaposition to the bitcoin framework.  In describing the entire picture.  If you want to focus on the paper alone, you're missing the bigger picture.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:00:56
This is the key.  Market saturation.  Nobody knows the saturation point.  
There is a saturation point - every value storage medium has one.  We don't know if it's a percentage of the market value of gold, a percentage of a particular currency, or a percentage of all the currencies....
It could be gargantuan, it could be less.  I believe it's much more than what we see today, though - and I believe there will be a snowball effect ongoing for a while.  As adoption increases then more people will adopt it, and on and on.

True, that is correct in regard to how loans are structured now.  But another way to structure a loan is according to value instead of monetary units.  The question for the lender to answer, is what index they would like to use in order to determine principal in terms of value.  They could make their own index and write that into the loan.
As a side note, bitcoin is hard coded to be inflationary in terms of money supply until 2140.  However, inflation or deflation is not supply alone, it's also demand.  So if you have demand that outstrips supply, you have deflation.  It's just supply and demand economics, and this affects all currencies... a fiat system simply has the ability to change the supply side of the equation by printing money... you could theoretically manage inflation or deflation using other levers, though.

I don't think it's overplayed.  Hashrate is our wall against defeat. Specifically, the threat to be concerned about is whether or not someone gains control of something approaching 50% of the computing power on the network. The most likely source of this would be mining pools colluding. We would see that coming. However, I can envision other scenarios that we wouldn't see coming. So, more hashrate means it's harder for something to sabotage Bitcoin in a way that we would not see coming.

I understand where you're coming from, I truly do.  And yes, we should always defend against anything that would lead to creating hassle for bitcoin, and certainly anything that could lead to bitcoin being banned.  And I agree it should not be treated as property for tax purposes... but I assure you that the IRS is nothing to worry about in that regard.  They come up with all kinds of odd definitions  so that they can tax things however they want.  
The US government is a 20 headed beast that ultimately is controlled by the people through congress.  We might face some bumps in the road, but ultimately everything will work out.  The FBI loves bitcoin due to its traceability.  FinCEN will never call it property, because then we wouldn't need to comply with money laundering regulations.  The Federal Reserve has no regulatory authority. 
Ultimately, the government cannot ban it unless it is inherently bad, and money and numbers are not inherently bad.  The IRS's definition means nothing for the bigger picture in the regard you are suggesting.
edit: Just to give you an example, stocks and gold and so forth are regarded as property for tax purposes.  This is very normal and expected for the IRS to treat bitcoin as property.  No, it's not good, but no, it's not bad in the way you are suggesting.

... Sorry what didn't I address?
You suggested that money would not move in a deflationary economy.  I said that it would move just the same.  I said that it would move just the same because people have bills to pay that will never go away: rent, food, utilities, TAXES, and the various things people like to do with their money such as have fun and travel, go to school, etc.    And I also said that people will buy things with their money because they want what money buys, not money itself and we can see this most easily in a lottery winner that is broke a year later.
... Do you think not having inflation will foster more sound investments?
My position is that inflation fosters unsound investments, whereas deflation doesn't foster unsound investments.  
... Do you want no inflation or do you want deflation?  Or just a free wheeling fixed quantity currency?
In the short term, any currency is free wheeling because monetary policy is not going to impact daily price swings and reactionary capital flight.  Monetary policy is a slow and long-term tool.  What will keep price swings muted is a greater liquidity pool.  A global currency that is infinitely divisible is POTENTIALLY the greatest liquidity pool I can think of - and if adoption reaches great numbers then volatility will be muted and deflation will be as predictable as global GDP.  But in cases of lower demand you could also see inflation.  I don't care which, as long as it's natural.  I want real money that isn't vulnerable to arbitrary wealth transfer "for my benefit" or the benefit of someone else.  
... Is inflation to you, in this discussion the value of a currency or the quantity?
Inflation is rising prices or the decrease in value of my currency as far as I am using the term... and can be caused by a lot of things.  Increased money supply, decreased money demand, loss of faith in the currency, decreased production, decreased competition in the marketplace, news of various sorts... lots of things.   But the inflation I've been watching and the inflation I'm most concerned about is being caused primarily by money printing activities (QE, debt monetization, fractional reserve) that are so large that it surely overpowers all other possible causal factors.
... How does inflation transfer wealth to the government and fed?
Debt demonetization made possible by the Fed, which causes inflation, which makes EVERY man's US dollar able to buy a little less, which is a defacto wealth transfer.
... Pretty well every businesses carries debt. Pays some of it's employees with its loans, and uses the loans for research and expansion. There would be no one to facilitate these loans without a central bank making dollars available. This would result in much fewer jobs available. This helps the middle class.
The fractional reserve free-wheeling preceding 1929, and the fractional reserve freewheeling preceeding 2008 CREATED the crisis.  You're arguing that it ALSO saved us from the crisis.  That's theoretical.  It did not save us from 1929.  And the QE of late is not over and not proven.  Regardless, it created the crisis and therefore your argument that we need loans that people obviously cannot afford is contradictory at best... so I disagree that we need that level of credit access, and I also disagree that we would not have loans.  We had loans on the gold standard.  It's not hard.  In an inflationary economy, a nominal rate is calculated as thus:  inflation+real rate=nominal rate.   So, a loan for 7% created in an economy with 6% expected inflation means a real rate of 1% for the bank. They make 1% on your money.    In a deflationary economy loans will just cost more.  But if you need money, you will pay.  It's true that people won't WANT loans as much, but the net effect is that the money doesn't go to bankers, it goes to the economy in other areas.  And there are other ways to gain capital investment beyond simple loans.  VCs know all about that.
... When was the middle class really created? Shortly after the depression, right?
Depends on how you define the middle class.  I like to think that the entire American experience built the middle class.  The Frontiersmen and women broke the yoke of feudalism and built the middle class.  I would argue that it simply evolved over the years, and really rose during WWII and the rise of American manufacturing, and the GI Bill raising the bar of education for the average American.  There's lots of ways to measure wealth beyond per capita wage.
...You could argue that it started in the twenties, but that financial system couldn't handle the debt placed on it, which led to the Fed.
You might argue that, if free money that doesn't really exist is your definition of wealth and a rising middle class, but the Fed was created in 1913 and arguably led to the fractional reserve fiasco that culminated in 1929.  It did not save us from it.  WWII saved us from it.  It created the depression.
...Median income has risen 89% since 1990. Actually grown slightly more than inflation. (from ssa.gov) so you are wrong there. People would make about 1500 less per year if it had only grown at the rate of inflation.
That's impossible, man... come on.  Think about it.  89%?  Think about it.  That's not accurate.  Our economy has been in economic decline for decads.  It's striking.  All you have to do is drive around anytown USA!  It's shocking.  Common sense tells you that.  That number is obviously not inflation adjusted.  
Look up "real wages".  It's the term used to describe inflation adjusted wages.

OK, a standard simple interest loan is like this:
1000 loaned dollars, 4% annual interest RATE. So in one year, you will owe 1040 dollars. Also, consider that your dollars have lost 2% due to inflation.  So you are actually paying the bank $1019 dollars worth of VALUE. 
Except, the bank already expects that.  They expect 2% inflation, and they expected to get $19 of value out of you for the year.  In other words, it seems like a good deal but really it's exactly what everyone expected to happen because the loan is written up that way.
In a deflationary economy you might do this:
1000BTC at 2% interest YIELD, so in one year you owe 980BTC.  Also, consider that your bitcoin have gained 4% due to deflation.  So, you are actually oweing the bank 1019BTC of VALUE.  
Yet again, 19BTC left on the table for the bank.

Another layman here, but I believe most people are absolutely unaware of the exact amount of inflation or deflation at any given time.  They are only aware of prices, and only over short periods, such as 1-3 years.  I think most educated people are definitely aware of the definition of inflation and deflation, but they are not paying conscious attention.
In practice, therefore - only run-away inflation or deflation has an actual impact on perceived prices - and therefore in a currency with a relatively stable supply and relatively constant market saturation, nobody will notice that it is long term deflationary.  However, nobody will have their money robbed by inflation over time either.

No, Watts was not arguing for bitcoin, that's true.  That being said, Watts did not want to argue against the prized nobel economists of the day. 
 So, he had to argue his position within the constraints of the framework that the economists forced him to argue it.  In other words, the economists said "inflation is good"... and so Watts was forced to argue his position within that framework otherwise he would have a much more difficult time having his ideas taken seriously.  
Accordingly, he had to come up with something else that could fairly distribute the economic surplus.  Some separate "unit of account"... However, it doesn't exist and nor COULD it exist.  
In other words, a deflation oriented currency is exactly what could evenly distribute the surplus economic output evenly to all humankind... but the economists said that deflation is bad... so Watts ultimately left the question unanswered.  But a smart audience can see that perhaps the economists are in fact wrong about inflation... Watts leaves that to the audience to decide.
A deflationary currency is the only solution to fairly distribute economic surplus.   Bitcoin is that incorruptible worldwide deflationary currency.  Although, I would argue that upon full adoption, deflation would actually be very muted... but ultimately this is fair.  
Inflation is not fair.  Inflation is where central bankers get to siphon that economic surplus and distribute it as they see fit.  Why shouldn't we all benefit from the advancement of society?
REAL money has always been the solution.  The economists are wrong.  We do not need to prevent deflation.  Deflation is not the problem, it's actually the perfect solution.  The problem that we need to address is people's perception of deflation.   We are the problem, not our money.  Our perceptions are the real issue that needs addressing.

@_date: 2014-04-07 17:15:44
Inflation is caused by alot of things.  The inflation that we're talking about is the result of central monetary policies.  Fractional reserve, debt monetization, QE, etc.  In other words:  money printing.   The inflation we're talking about is the result of centralized redistribution of wealth by bankers and governments.  
It's enabled by the fact that the currency does not have a limited supply since the 1971 ending of Bretton Woods.   Now, if you eliminate those centralized money "printing" activities then you limit the supply of money and as a result this type of inflation stops.  
The absence of human-directed influence on the money is more natural by any definition of the word natural.  
Now, you might think that if money supply is static, then money itself takes on a static value, but we know that it actually starts gaining value.
WHY IS THAT?  This is an important question to answer in your mind because now you realize that inflation is taking a lot more value out of the system than originally considered.  The reason it gains in value is that economic output is generally positive.  Economies grow, but furthermore efficiency in economic production generates more value output for less value input as time goes on. Think about robotic manufacturing and better farming practices, etc.  In other words, GDP is rising. 
But who gets the benefit of the economic growth?  Why shouldn't we all gain the benefit of those increases in production?  Well, we would ... if not for inflation.
Think about it:  If we have 4% inflation since last year and we eliminate money printing, we don't have 0% inflation.  We have (for example) 4% deflation.  That means that while inflation is 4%, money printing is actually taking out 8% of economic value out of the system.
That's a shitload of money.  This hurts everyone (not just the middle class) because ask yourself:   What could the free market do with 8% more capital EVERY YEAR.  Where is it going?  Who benefits from that directly?

@_date: 2014-04-08 13:51:14
I was simply using community to illustrate that someone outside of one's self is required in order to establish rights.  Rights is a communal concept.  Rights, morals, etc.. have no utility unless there is at least one other person or entity in the universe.
In the same vein, I am also arguing that you do not need to have more than one person to have property.   A man alone will have his home and garden and things that he directs to his own benefit and that he will protect from the forces of nature as he would protect against any other man, beast or even himself if he is prone to fits of rage.
You cannot combine the two concepts (right and property) since property can exist with the first human, whereas rights cannot exist until you have two.  
Therefore property existed with the first human, but the right to property existed with the second, and the defending of the property existed with the one who went against that right.  I would note that the right existed whether the second person agreed or not.  It was the mere disagreement of the first that was required to create the right... but it did not create the property.  Since the force was unrighteous, it was theft.

In any economy, people spend money to pay rent, eat and get all the things that money gets you.

Well for one here's someone who actually understands what gives things a value: perception.  Not some intrinsic property.  And that's a fact.
But his arguments against it are interesting:  Central banks will not give up control, and traditional retail does not price items in BTC.
Valid short-term arguments, but I disagree that these are long-term arguments.  But that's a matter of whether or not you believe Bitcoin will survive, and whether it is something people NEED.   Because if people need it, then people will use it.  Once adoption becomes greater (in a few years) you will see more and more merchants holding BTC, and therefore denominating products in BTC.

The federal reserve is the lender of last restort.  It is a revenue stream for everyone at the top.  It gets money by printing money, aka inflation.  It has no money, that's why it has never been audited.  The audit would reveal no money, and everyone knows that so there is really no reason to audit the federal reserve unless you want to destroy the entire system.

One of the largest mistakes people make is that they think Bitcoin competes with Visa.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Bitcoin doesn't do what Visa does.  Cash does not allow reversing a transaction, Visa is what creates that ability.  Visa will eventually accept Bitcoin.  They already accept and convert every other currency in the world.  
The challenges that Bitcoin has will be overcome.  Its value in the protocol is that there is no central controlling power and it cannot be counterfeited, and it can be "transmitted" anywhere in the world.  
It might not be used to buy a latte, but it will be used to pay your Visa bill... The protocol IS Bitcoin - it's always been about the protocol.  The rough edges need to be smoothed out, and the right pieces need to be connected together, and a lot of innovation is still yet to be done.  We are still in the beginning... The protocol is a computer science innovation that creates something that has NEVER existed in any form in the entire history of the world:  A solution to the two generals problem.  Satoshi would be winning a Nobel if they hadn't chose to be anonymous.
What can be done with the protocol?  Again, think Internet 1984.  The sky is the limit.  The world wide web is a '90s thing.  SSL for e-commerce is a late 1990s thing.  Facebook didn't even come out until 2008.

The point I’ve been trying to make is that in an inflationary economy if you set the nominal rate at 15%, and you have 4% inflation, your real rate is 11%.
To get the same real rate in a deflationary economy, just set the nominal rate at 7% and you have the same 11% real rate.
That's what I've been trying to say., but using different terms.  The point is that you can structure a loan, when all factors are considered, to make a profit for the lender, and the borrower would borrow if they thought they could benefit from the loan.  This is how it has always worked.  The idea that it cannot work in a deflationary world is simply a misunderstanding in regard to how interest is calculated and ignores the fact that deflation is simply one variable in the overall equation.

I understand your argument *perfectly*.  
I was pushing it to the next logical conclusion, that if *you* want to argue that property is forced, then it must be forced *away from me* as much as it's a force that takes something *away from anyone else* and that's not what's happening in the world.
No, I gained my property by lawful work that others willingly and gladly payed me for by bartering or by value exchange through money.  This is a mutually beneficial exchange of labor that communities participate in.
If we go back to the "original" controller of the resource of land, we would find nobody controlled it.  Therefore the original "source" of property is the universe, and therefore your argument is invalid.
It is therefore the *protection of property* not the *acquisition of property* that requires force against those who would like to separate you from your property.
The agreement of the community IS the justification for my rights.  It's that simple.

Bitcoin is perfect money.  It works exactly like gold, without the confusing alternative uses and with the benefit of digital transfers and storage.
Inherent value is not what gives money value. It's never been what gives money value. Obviously I'm right - because bitcoin can be used to buy things, ergo it has value. Value is external, not internal to money.  It is something people and markets give it, not something it gives us.

My man - you've got it backwards.  Inflation is where bankers receive money fresh off the presses (fractional reserve banking) and where politicians get to spend money on their friends (monetizing the debt).  Inflation refers to the fact that the SUPPLY OF MONEY has grown, which dilutes the value of all existing money.  This effectively gives the people at the top some money by taking it away from everyone else.  In other words, your money is worth less over time.
Deflation is the exact opposite - your money increases in value over time.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:42:45
The point I’ve been trying to make is that in an inflationary economy if you set the nominal rate at 15%, and you have 4% inflation, your real rate is 11%.
To get the same real rate in a deflationary economy, just set the nominal rate at 7% and you have the same 11% real rate.
That's what I've been trying to say., but using different terms.  The point is that you can structure a loan, when all factors are considered, to make a profit for the lender, and the borrower would borrow if they thought they could benefit from the loan.  This is how it has always worked.  The idea that it cannot work in a deflationary world is simply a misunderstanding in regard to how interest is calculated and ignores the fact that deflation is simply one variable in the overall equation.

There are always two people in any trade.
The subjective value that two people place on an item will always be slightly different otherwise trade would not occur.  Everyone wants to get a "good deal".  So to speak.
You could say both people are wrong, but in fact there is no objective value. Therefore they are neither wrong nor right.
If you centralize trading into an exchange, you simply have many two-party transactions happening in one central area which makes valuation much more efficient.  
This centralized and aggregate value might seem more "accurate" or objective, but it's an illusion because there are many factors that sway the market and the sum of all subjective opinion at a given moment is not the same thing as objectivity.
The sum of subjective opinion leads to efficient pricing and liquidity.  It does not lead to objective pricing.  
If you take any two random traders off the exchange, and put them on an island, they will likely reach an agreement that suits them both at some price that may not be the same that they would have reached in a larger group.  
That just illustrates market dynamics, it doesn't make anyone incorrect.  You can't have objective value.

Anyway succeed because there are many ways that you get disqualified from receiving the profits from your downline.  By the time you qualify for anything, amway has made more than enough money to pay you.  It's called multilevel marketing.  It's different from a pyramid or Ponzi, because there are specific rules that you must follow to get any money,  various cutoff points and disqualifications that prevent it from becoming a full pyramid.  You're just a salesman with a commission that's tied to growing the business rather than straight sales.  It works.
In the other hand, fiat is similar to a pyramid.  A Ponzi has no product.  So I would suggest fiat is a pure pyramid.  The old reason it doesn't automatically fail is that people are constantly putting real value into the system and the govt. can dip right down to the bottom using QE and taxes.  So it's a pyramid with a relief valve.  But eventually it will come crashing down if there is competition (such as Bitcoin)

Well... directly from capital loss deductions, no.  Capital loss reduces your real income.
But there are a BOATLOAD of additional deductions you might be able to take as a miner considering that you could treat it as self employment income.  So even if you made 1 cent as a miner, you could deduct a portion of ALL of your operating expenses: electricity, water, gas, internet, rent, property taxes, insurance, equipment costs..  etc.  It's called the home office deduction.. and it's apportioned according to square footage of the office, not actual costs.  So if you have a 2000 sq ft home, and your mining operation takes up a 500sq ft office, you can deduct 25% of almost all of your bills, plus 100% of your equipment costs.
edit: spelling and also this would be the bitcoin miner tax loophole, and the IRS would be forced to either retract the bullshit treatment as income or they would have a hard time explaining why this income is different from some other form of money making activity that involves real costs.

Right, if you added it it would.
You shouldn't add it... Your target nominal rate is 15%, so in a deflationary economy you would subtract the deflation rate to get 11% as your "real" rate and add 4% deflation, which brings you to 15% nominal.

You do realize that the FDIC does not protect from theft?  It protects you only in one specific circumstnace: if the specific bank that you're using fails completely.  For example, if Chase Bank failed.
Of course, if all banks fail or if the USD fails, then there is no insurance for that.

First thing, we will always be governed by human nature.  The trick of any system is to funnel human nature into a framework that helps us.
Bitcoin relies on human nature: call it greed, call it survival instincts, call it passion for improving life on earth, many things...
Bitcoin takes that and funnels it into a framework or rule set that effectively protects the network without requiring a central authority.
In other words, I can use the network, and that benefits me.  I can improve the network, and that benefits me more.  If I try to disrupt or harm the network, I gain very little.

Exactly.  People buy when they want to buy.  I do not consider inflation when I make a purchase today, and I won't consider deflation when I make a purchase either.  Unless it's HYPERdeflation.  
Over long terms, deflation will push merchants to lower prices ahead of the deflation curve (or with it) instead of raising them ahead of the inflation curve in order to remain competitive, so to speak.  
People are spenders by nature.  Irresponsibly so. They have a "now now now" mentality. Bitcoin and a little deflation will not change that.

Wow. There are many errors in this article.
 For one, they suggest a 51% attack could "destroy bitcoin". It would, maybe, allow someone to complete a double spend and that would temporarily impact confidence but not destroy bitcoin. Miners would react and join a new pool, and so would the rest of us react as appropriate, and nobody would lose a single bitcoin.
Also, they say that there is no way to stabilize the money supply as with fiat - sure there is: as adoption plateaus, so will volatility.
Also, this idea that anyone would build a payment network for banks and the visas of the world using bitcoin technology is born out if a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin survives today. And even if they did that, we would still use bitcoin...
But the most interesting thing is that they absolutely consider it a serious threat to value storage. (ie deposit banking)
Then they go on to give a full bitcoin tutorial. Brilliant stuff. They truly do not seem to feel threatened by bitcoin. The believe the emerging market distrust of banks will lead to increased bitcoin adoption, but do not see that as playing a role in the adoption of the first world. Obviously, that is a very micro viewpoint. At a macro level, worldwide adoption would threaten the currency used for worldtrade. If everyone uses bitcoin for world trade, then THAT would affect banks in the first world because now you don't need a bank to store your currency, not because people distrust banks.

Why do you spend so much energy on this particular topic?
People cannot be their own depository institutions today - how could you possibly gauge desire?  Nobody has even thought about it. 
 Now they will.
 
Bitcoin is new and evolving in terms of features, ecosystem, usability, etc.  Just like 1989 Internet usability problems, there will be solutions to the usability issues of Bitcoin.
Multisignature will provide people with various opportunities for security in unprecedented situations.  For example, I could have escrowed micro transactions in the middle of nowhere.  Multi sig will show uses in areas we can't even imagine.  It's huge.
 Trezor shows us that a hardware wallet can be easy to use.
Software is improving and will improve constantly: night and day.
But I don't need examples, I just need problems.  You show me a usability problem, and common sense says that someone will solve it in the next 2 years.
Everyone is working on making the ability to use, hold and work with Bitcoin an easy reality.
Improvements will happen and need to happen not just for me but for millions of other Bitcoin users.. So it will not be "which bank do I use" but rather "why so I still need a bank".. And if the answer is deposit security, I'm not sure that's going to be a strong attraction anymore.  There will be other reasons I would need a bank...  But who needs a CD at a piddly 1% yield when I have deflation?  Lol.
How will banks make loans when deposits go down and fractional reserve goes out of style?  
VC style investments or peer to peer loans, or seller financing may become the norm...  
Banks will need to evolve.

Exactly.  Money is what makes it work.  It's what gives people an incentive to build the network, to mine, and to grow the ecosystem.

You're right, to some extent, but you will not have centrally controlled fractional reserve with FDIC hiding the failures.  People will be stung hard by the Mt Goxxes of the future.
They will be more intune with whether their bitcoin is under their control or not. Depository institutions will need to provide more incentive for deposits.

@_date: 2014-04-02 14:48:01
I won't disagree...
...but I think it's not as freaky as people make it out to be.  In order to meet current KYC regulations and FinCEN regulations there's no way to make an automated bitcoin CURRENCY EXCHANGE machine unless it has a way to positively identify you.
Machines need a way to make sure you're not converting thousands of dollars per day in order to meet those regulations.  They need digital identify information about you in order to do that... or they would need a human being standing there instead.
You and I can identify eachother using our minds and memory, using facial recognition.  We remember eachother.  People are very good at this, but of course machines are better but they need the right information.
 Faces are a biometric, so is a fingerprint or vein print - but you don't get freaked out when you go to a bank and the teller stares at you and checks your ID and looks up your account for suspicious activity while you stand there like an idiot.   
Using computers, I can also capture a digital representation of your face without you knowing... so I don't think this is as creepy or impossible as people make it out to be.   
The main difference here is that the information can be stored in a database and potentially shared with organizations without our consent. 
 It would be better if we had another way to handle KYC and FinCEN requirements that did not involve biometrics... or to change the regulations... but until then I would rather see Bitcoin gain wider adoption than try to slow down robocoin .
If Bitcoin gains wider adoption, then I believe we will be in a stronger position to push for change.

The blockchain is a result of hardware power and a huge investment on that hardware by miners.  It's also a bit of software.  It's also the entire ecosystem because nobody would use that blockchain unless there was a financial benefit.  So no, bitcoin cannot "simply be replicated".
The computational power doesn't actually create the coins.
 It's used to verify transactions and that process is what preserves the integrity of the network because the transaction history can be trusted without relying on a central party.
There is a completely arbitrary reward for verifying transactions which is entered into the blockchain as a transaction for the miner that discovered the block that confirmed those transactions.
The blockchain is an incorruptible central ledger, bitcoins are just unspent transaction outputs.  All computational power is used to verify transactions according to a set of agreed upon rules.
The block reward could be 0, 25 or 25,000,000.  This is just a transaction sent to the miners address, as part of the verified block that the miner discovered, that effectively rewards the miner for verifying that block.  As long as the block meets the rules, then the block will be accepted by everyone else on the network because everyone else can check the math and see that all is legit.

I am not *advocating* hoarding.  People are not hoarders by nature.   Whether I advocate it or not, people will not hoard.  They will spend.  You have to consider human nature.  People want what money gives them and therefore they want to spend their money.  You don't have to convince them to do that. 
I would argue that people are irresponsibly spend-oriented by nature, and a little nudge in the opposite direction would be a good idea.  
My point is that the savers are the ones who start businesses, and inflation only punishes responsible people.  
You're never going to convince anyone to loan you money if you can't save, and you'll never convince a bank to loan you money unless you already have a cash-flow-positive business.  You will never start a business with finances like you described in any economy.  Accordingly, you will always have a job.

But if you want to start the next fast-food franchise craze?  Watch Shark Tank on ABC.  Plenty of food related VC funding going on.
And take note:  You must have collateral to secure almost every loan.  That means SOMEONE saved something in order to get the loan.  It's just a cart before the horse mentality.  A "now now now" mentality.  There are other options.
