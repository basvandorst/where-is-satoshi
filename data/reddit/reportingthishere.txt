I'm saying it appears worse than just increasing to 2 MB.  Certainly more complicated. But bandwidth and number crunching-wise, if I want to maintain the same level of security receiving payments as I currently do, it is worse than a max block increase.  (Maybe only a few percent...)
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:31:52
I've never settled off chain, so I wouldn't know about that.  What percent savings are you getting going the off chain route?  I mean, is it really worth it for all the hassle?  You used the present tense, so actual numbers, please...  If you are saving money by going off chain, doesn't that mean Miners make less income and the main chain is comparatively less secure?
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:28:08
Who knows.  It all depends on the urgency of the transactions (subjective to the senders themselves) in the backlog of transactions based on time preferences.  Where their pain points are is anybody's guess.  You should totally trust our Federal Reserve Board equivalents in the Kore Krew to manage the dials in that regard for everybody.  
My other concern here is:  If users are "saving money" by using LN, then, by definition, miners are "losing money."  You can't have it both ways can you?  A magic money making machine?   How will the main chain be secured against 51% attack when at least a worth-mentioning-on-reddit portion of fees are being consumed by LN operators instead?  Is that wise?  To what degree is that wise?

Why not just always settle?  I've just always used the blockchain directly.  Haven't you?  Seems less complicated and usually making things more complicated then they need to be doesn't make sense...  I tried Mt. Gox's off-chain wallet but did not like the experience.

My buddy paid me from his XT client right to my phone when I was watching.  Other altcoins don't work like that.  What is different about XT as an altcoin that allows it to interoperate with the bitcoin network like that?

Don't worry, the company under scrutiny here is only like 15% of the hashrate.  If it were like 51% of the hashrate, maybe adult diapers would be in order.   Right now only 50% of POW backed coinbase transactions are voting for larger blocks.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:52:02
Ok, but is that wise?  Insecurity of the main chain defined by how cheap Miner competition can get?  Sure it is great from a user perspective, as long as the main chain preserves value...

The bottom layer currently only has room for about 350k transactions per day.  That's like 1 tx per day for 5/1000th of 1% of the world.  Access is restricted by bytes.

Decentralization is a tool. Tools are not goals. Tools are selected and used to reach goals. What is the goal? How might decentralization be used reach that goal and to what degree does it help? What are the costs associated with that tool? What other tools are available?

Before you go spending it you should probably check how congested the network is at that point in time and how many satoshis people are generally paying in fees to get accepted into the first few blocks.

By that same logic, I can ignore them completely.  They are not hired by me to do anything.  Sure they can code hobby projects in their spare time but what is that to me?  I didn't ask them pigeon hole bitcoin and constrain the flow of transactions.  I didn't ask them to throw their influence around the splatter boards, I just ignore those childish antics.  Nope, I didn't sign up for any of that.

With RBF and a huge backlog of transactions, folks who need to can enter into a bidding war in order to settle.  There is no constraint on how high the fees can go.  The blockchain can process about 350k transactions per day.  There are 7 billion people.  What is that ratio?  Like, Bitcoin's capacity is servicing the needs of 5/1000th of 1% of the world per day.  Things can get very tight very quickly.   
Or folks just switch to Litecoin (cheaper, faster settlement, more capacity).

Information Science 101: when you break apart the signatures and deliver them some other complicated supposedly secure method, you force me to link those signatures back to their original transactions.  That link is additional weight on my network and cpu.  I am forced to download additional data and put more wear on my CPU compared to traditional transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:56:16
When you want to access your cold storage, how long are you willing to wait for your transaction to be confirmed by the network and how much are you willing to pay in fees?   
Kore Krew have been warning us for some time that initial confirmation times and the costs can become very large.  Perhaps it is just best to leave your coins on Coinbase? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:41:24
Except for the part where you fail to mention the so-called "developer community" has unfortunately gone down some other path that isn't exactly what the white paper is on about.  The "developer communicty as a whole" (whatever that means) is de facto hostile.

You'd think they'd try it out on Testnet first before selling it to the entire world?   I know I would before signing my name on something but I'm just a comp sci student.  I guess they do things differently in billion dollar industries.

It seems Litecoin fees won't get out of hand as quickly as Bitcoin and they have just about as good a track record at, you know, processing transactions.  Litecoin certainly has more capacity.  Ethereum looks promising.  From what I can tell Ethereum development is much better funded and the funding keeps coming in.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:03:36
It makes sense to no longer sign for transactions in the blockchain?  
Why sign at all?  Okay, if we must provide signatures to spend money, what are the logical steps that make sense removing said signatures from where they've been up until now?  
Don't conflate malleability with scalability.  
Segwit is just dandy if technically feasible, bug- and risk-free, and doesn't cost me anything.  I may never use it but I don't care if others do.  Solving malleability is cool.

So, you are saying:


Getting back to the topic of teh thread,  isn't doing this Alt-coin thing exactly what Peter Todd is quoted as recommending?  You agree with Peter here, right? That competing teams should release competing code (ALTCOINS)?  Not to mention the fact that severely restricted blocks are a bastardization of what the White Paper stands for, an altcoin in and of itself and a failure of self-appointed devs to address the issue in a timely manner.  
If you are not focused solely on Peter's quirky view of Bitcoin(tm), can't you see that an Altcoin presented to humanity that is the same as Bitcoin in every respect except that it allows more participants the ability to write to the blockchain, and that if such an altcoin navigates security issues successfully, that such an altcoin would be a net benefit for humanity?

Funny and unpredictable things happen when demand outpaces inelastic supply.  Predictions based on demand and supply both floating do not apply.

The difficulty thresholds for Bitcoin and this new Classic coin are identical.

Miners effectively sell us block space. They should have the ability to manage the supply of the commodity they are selling.   Seems to me to uphold the spirit of Satoshi's whitepaper... 
Coinbase transaction voting to communicate with users and industry what the max blocksize will be (calculate and adjust max block size during regular difficulty adjustments).  
Miners *should* set a max size that maximizes profit/hashrate.  Meaning users are happy with the size miners choose as reflected in miner profits.  Perhaps a leap.  If not Miners then who else do we TRUST to set all the dials   "close enough to work"?   Is that what we are hoping to get from these TBD trusted entities, a minimum viable product?

An answer to the question: "How can we make this thing more decentralized" will always be a valid answer to the question "How can we make this more expensive."
