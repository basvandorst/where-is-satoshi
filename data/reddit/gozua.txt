I like the way you format text but the bold on the Nostradamus apocalyptic "there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point". Is like telling people bet on roulette black color after red came out 10 times. I disagree also on the "To reduce risk" part. At that point why not change it in "How to reduce risk of a risky investment".
Most of the one who invested in BTC hopes one day to have more wealth in BTC than in fiat. A better suggestion is "invest what you can recover".

On 2010 I read about BTC on an holdem AI forum (O.H.), started mining, few days later i thought about ecological impact and stopped it.

All other fiat will keep going down with inflation, so more dollars printed more needed to buy btc.

suppose you can buy a BTC at Euro 500 and i've payed it Euro 50. Suppose one day BTC worth Euro 10.000, you gained 9500 euro, I gained 9950. Will you feel far behind me?

Not a good point. when they say "it's backed by government trust" ask them "like in venezuela?". Ask them "what about government seizing bank account money in Cyprus?"

Sorry for that, I can imagine how do u feel.
Probably they keylogged you for days. 
Best option is to format and sell that computer, buy 2 new computers and use any software that allow you offline transaction signature.
You can get an idea how far from secure transfers you were giving a look at Glacier Protocol.

your btc will never be 100% secure, there are only different levels of security. Have a look at 
The worst level of security is when someone is the owner of your coins (owning your private keys) like in the case of exchanges.
Invest in btc what you can loose and leave on exchange what u really don't care to loose.
