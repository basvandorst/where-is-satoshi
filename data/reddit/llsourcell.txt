Please define what other avenues are possible. As far as I'm aware there exists only two-way and one-way pegging as sidechain options.

1. Having a single identity doesn't mean everyone can see which services you use. I have a single identity in the real world, but no one knows I go to a Yoga class a few times a week. 
2. Not every website would have to adhere to the protocol, there would still be completely anonymous websites, you just wouldn't be paid for data you share. 
3. Valid point on how to check if someone hasn't created multiple identities. Someone could, there's no way of stopping that, it would just be counterintuitive because your payments would be fragmented. I'll have to think about how to solve that. 
4. Yes, thats the plan. I wanted some market validation first. 
5. Properties about yourself like name and location would help because this specific wallet would be connected to the internet. It would serve as your identity, wealth, and authentication method to use major services. 
6. The most popular ideas that are re-shared do gain the most economic rewards, because they deserve to. The system would have to be fair enough that people who aren't posted super relevant content to everyone still get paid a reasonable sum. A web crawler could check with guaranteed certainty, Google uses one for that exact purpose. 
7. Thank you, I did. Thanks for the critique.

you're saying the change doesn't go "live" in the network unless other people pull the updates to their bitcoin client? What if someone just pulls the changes not knowing what that code change means since they aren't a programmer and that single node just fucked the entire network?
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:22:19
The reason for decentralization is so that you can own your data. People can pay you for your data with micropayments. No central authority owns your data.

of course they would..any money they can get from us, they'll take.

The fact that if adoption increases, the value of their coins will increase as well.

I've seen that diagram but it doesn't answer my question. Which one of those is bitcoin? Distributed or decentralized? I thought that a distributed network is one that relies on all nodes for computation. If one node goes down, the whole network goes down. A decentralized network doesn't require all nodes, if one node goes down, the network can still operate. In that sense bitcoin is decentralized not distributed, but even satoshi called it distributed in the paper! Confused.

That's awesome to hear!

'What is Bitcoin?' video made by me, hope it helps: 
@_date: 2016-01-02 18:13:21
Ha! It is a pretty out there idea. I spent a few months trying to solve "proof of identity" but couldn't. Perhaps there is a decentralized way to prove uniqueness but for now gov ids are a possible way. I'm not a separatist, I believe we should use existing infrastructure to augment Bitcoin and vice versa. Thanks for the comment and for watching!! 
@_date: 2016-01-03 03:38:35
Woot i'm so glad! I'll keep em coming
@_date: 2016-01-02 18:10:29
Thanks so much! Will do

Decentralized consensus isn't seen as a measurable advantage when building a decentralized social network/search engine/ride-sharing app? How so?

Yup, located in the US. Thanks, will do

No I just meant like 1 point for the bitcoin movement, woot. 
but thanks for that lifeboatz, I didn't know how to do that either. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:29:11
thats what i was thinking. quickpay is basically already their digital currency-esque implementation. they'd have to go global to compete with bitcoin. ain't gonna happen.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:14:18
Where are you located? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:56:20
Learning while doing. Just googled those 2 things, now I do. Thanks for the friendly advice! (I think I have a high probability of success, but let's agree to disagree).
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:42:25
wtf is that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:52:02
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:10:38
So they'd re-sell the bitcoin to another currency exchange like Mt Gox in return for fiat? Then who does Mt Gox sell the bitcoin to in order to get fiat? Is there a never ending chain of people just selling bitcoin for fiat? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:02:52
Let's take BitPay as an example. They are targeting just merchants. All they do is let merchants accept bitcoin. If I'm a merchant that wants to accept bitcoin, I sign up, attach my bank account and start accepting bitcoin. At the end of a business day, I have 10 BTC in my BitPay account. I click 'Sell BTC and send my bank account the converted USD'. Do they just keep that BTC and give me USD from their own company bank account? They accept the value of BTC as being equivalent to the value of USD even though its so volatile?
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:01:39
Taenk, I get your idea, and I too find it appealing but...
Isn't that basically a bank? Correct me if I'm wrong. Doesn't a bank basically store and ensure a user's currency?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:14:34
Ha, what a joke. They can't do shit.

Hey, everyone's got to start somewhere. edit: also noticed ur in NYC as well. where at? I'm on the UWS. maybe we can catch up and talk btc
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:59:01
Buy them from your friends or locally using localbitcoins.com Don't listen to Darkwings_08. Bitcoin's price is volatile. Its a new currency. Thats what happens. We have a long way to go. Coinbase just raised 25 million, Bitcoin ATMs are just starting to be created, an entire network of services are just getting off the ground based on this bitcoin protocol. Its the internet in 1994, bitcoin is going to be huge. Buy in while its cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:35:45
What the hell, stop flaming this guy. Sorry dude, there are some hardcore libertarians on here who hate any notion of government whatsoever. 
Listen, I agree that a lot of regulation sucks, but there are certain things that I think ought to be regulated. The world isn't binary you guys, do you want to privatize building roads, the school system, healthcare, etc? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:01:55
Well said BoomISay. How do you think Bitcoin could factor into all of this? I mean this is a hard economic problem to solve. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:26:08
Where are you located? Bay Area? If so, I'd be interested in teaming up. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:05:42
Good point. Damn. Well, we need some centralization for things like roads and healthcare. If bitcoin can't be a source for taxation, the dollar will remain. Maybe bitcoin will get huge, but not necessarily undermine the dollar. Maybe thats the ideal scenario.

Amazing. Question: Where you influenced by Jaron Lanier's system of micropayments? I was thinking about building this, glad to see someone did it.
