How do you see it? All P2SH begin with '3'.

For the next transaction use this address as another input.

Rebroadcast your BCH TX, miners did not get it.  
Also, you overpaid in fees.
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:44:32
Just rebroadcast it. Maybe you only sent to one node which did not propagate your tx.

It's every 2016 blocks. But the whitepaper does not state this number anywhere. In fact it says that the "proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour" which is closer to the DAA used in Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:07:30
There is no Bitcoin Cash lead dev. Amaury is lead dev of Bitcoin ABC which is the most used implementation (about 60% of the nodes running it).

That's Bitcoin and not Lightning **Network**. Payment channels are old tech.

Weird that you haven't been ce/ns0r3d yet...

How is Lightning Network Peer-to-Peer? Peer-to-Peer means that a payment goes directly from person to person without a third party. In Lightning, a payment goes through one or more nodes before it is received by the other person.
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:26:16
You are looking for the three-letter sub. But instead of the Lightning circlejerk here, you will find BCH circlejerk there. At least it's a little bit more mature though.
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:56:01
I'm not referring to the network structure and the title of the whitepaper does not mean the network structure either. It refers to the payments being Peer-to-Peer.  
In a way, Charlie is correct that Lightning is more Peer-to-Peer on network layer than Bitcoin, but that's not what the title means. So apparently, Charlie does not understand the title of the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:10:34
The idea of Lightning Network is to form a network of payment channels to route payments - this is not peer-to-peer as a payment goes through multiple parties. Yes, you can open a direct channel, but that's Bitcoin (you don't need Lightning) and not the default way of paying on the network.  
Yes, Lightning has some advantages over Bitcoin on-chain, but that does not justify Charlie's statement that Lightning is Peer-to-Peer - it's not.

With SegWit you get cheaper transactions.  
However, for storing BTC, Legacy is more secure.

This is true for the first few blocks. But later, many other miners did join, so it's unclear which blocks do belong to Satoshi and which do not.  
Satoshi might already have moved some coins but it can also be any early miner, have a look [here](
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:23:28
Satoshi might still be active in the Bitcoin community.  
Some days after the BCH fork, an early miner [moved some block rewards to an exchange address]( This might very well be Satoshi.  
Interestingly, these block rewards are still unspent on the BCH chain.

You are right that there is no solution for routing to work in a distributed manner. The Lightning whitepaper suggests that "eventually, with optimizations, the network will look a lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs".  
But finding a route is not the only issue: You need to find a route with enough liquidity in each channel. There is a proposal of AMP (split one payment into smaller payments and route them through different channels each) but that will require the sender to calculate multiple routes. When the network is large, this will take quite some time. In the mean time, liquidity in the found channels has changed and your payment fails with high probability.  
That's the reason why Lightning Network will end up depending on hubs that provide liquidity for it to work.  
People don't want to hear that but it's the truth. I'll probably get downvoted to hell but voting does not change facts.
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:18:54
Yeah, you can call LN a PoS system: The nodes that hold the most liquidity route the most transactions, therefore they get the most from the fees.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:07:28
The fees you are stating are not correct, for both. On BCH they are about $0.002 and Dogecoin fees are lower than that. However, Dogecoin is inflationary so that's the reason why it's cheaper to send.
@_date: 2018-07-10 23:18:05
Thanks for writing this. I just can't believe how many people think they are safe storing coins on SegWit addresses.
@_date: 2018-07-01 08:38:14
That's what I meant with liquidity but your explanation puts it straight.
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:09:18
Unless you mine, you do not contribute to decentralization.  
How should a non-mining node contribute? It can not do anything when the network gets attacked, e.g. 51%.  
Edit: Nice, getting downvoted but nobody gives counterarguments...
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:18:16
Nodes only ban peers for themselves, they can not do this for other peers.  
An own node does nothing in case of a 51% attack that blocks transactions or double spends. Have a look at Bitcoin Gold: The attacker did reorganize the blockchain by 21 blocks and no node was able to prevent this attack.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:58:08
You don't secure the network. If you run your own node you can verify for yourself that miners are not cheating.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:23:09
Excuse me for being the party pooper: You don't "contribute" by running a node.  
Also, from an economical perspective you should only run a node if you have a benefit of doing so.
@_date: 2018-07-15 04:08:07
Well, they are safe on Bitcoin Cash. No miner can steal them.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:54:43
Which people do because you offer the best liquidity and low fees.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:40:47
What's your point? You're shifting topics.
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:25:30


  
That's a naive assumption. History has proven otherwise, e.g. Betamax vs VHS.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:16:17
It even shows Doge transaction fees to be [slightly higher](
@_date: 2018-07-16 05:22:01
Yes, it does. That should be pretty simple to understand: In an inflational cryptocurrency you have the block reward that makes up for a part of the fee. Have a look at Steem: Free transactions with the disadvantage that it's inflationary.  
It's funny how I get downvoted to oblivion for presenting facts with sources. I'm sorry if they don't fit the narrative. This sub is a joke.
@_date: 2018-07-10 23:14:17
SegWit is a fix to unintenional transaction malleability and was a kind-of block size increase as well (1MB -&gt; 1.7MB blocks). The malleability fix allows for some features on the lightning network.  
Just remember that for regular payments you are best using SegWit transactions as they cost less, and for holding coins use legacy transactions as they have been proven to be secure for 9 years.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:29:58
Using averages with transaction fees is not very accurate. You could send one $100 fee to the network and can manipulate the value. In fact, many BCH wallets send with too high fees.  
Median is a bit more scientific but what you are really looking for is the lowest fee that gets you in the next block. Latter is not supported by this website though.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:40:29
Awesome work!  
Seeing that you did include "the rise and fall of Bitconnect": Will you add Verge on 17th then?
