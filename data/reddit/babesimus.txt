His company's sales are equal to less than .01% of the total Gold market...which makes it impossible for him to manipulate the market even if he wanted to. 
Also, Arbitrage is not the same as an agency transaction. Arbitrage is buying and selling the same product on two different markets at the same time. That is not what he does.
He helps meet retail buyers with wholesale sellers. And yes, he does charge more to the buyer than he pays the seller, that is how he makes money. But this is standard practice in the Gold market as well as all other kinds of markets...example here is car dealerships.
I am not going to tell you that he is not a scum bag, but it is not because of his Gold business. It is an above board company and he truly believes what he is doing helps people.
You have an irrational hatred of him.

That is a very long ramble about a myriad of personal choices. Some people keep gold at their house, some cash, some diamonds. So I'm not sure what your driving at.

Long answer made short as possible...selling debt as a nation requires ability to tax, ability to tax would still exist under full bitcoin system but is severely reduced due to loss of the ability to confiscate, which the state currently has, and bitcoin is resistant to. Without ability to tax sovereign debt is too risky.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:57:02


Gold is a resource, true. But is has no "intrinsic value", it has "utility value". But that is irrelevant since you are asking about how it comes into existence.


Bitcoin is created by man, true. But it is not easily copied...In fact it can not be copied at all. Just as prime numbers can not be "copied". You can write 7 on as many pieces of paper as you want but it doesn't double the essence of 7. There is only one 7. Just as there are only 21 million bitcoins and that's it...no duplication possible.
And again, this has nothing to do with how they come into existance. They are found, not created by Miners and you did not refute that in any way.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:19:35
I am not against Doge, but if you are looking at crypto as an investment, stick to an alt with a limited supply. Money supply elasticity will destroy doge over the long term. Bitcoin  "skyrocketed" because of the growth of users and because it adheres to fundamental principals of money, namely maximum supply. Doge has had user growth, but can never gain those large investors who understand constricted money supply as a necessity. Doge violates this principal and will therefore never experience what Bitcoin has.

See you don't even know why people chose Gold over the other metals. It is because Gold is the EASIEST metal to use as money. It is easily manipulated into smaller or larger pieces. It doesn't hold germs, it doesn't deteriorate or rust. The rarity of it has nothing to do with it. All metals are supply constrained on this planet so Gold had to be chosen for other reasons, and since you don't even understand why they chose Gold...why are you so confident you understand what is going on with Bitcoin?

Again, you are not getting it. There are as many substitutes to Gold as there are metals, and more than that too. But people CHOSE Gold because it was the BEST CHOICE available. That is no longer the case.
Bitcoin is now the BEST CHOICE for certain uses of money. People are choosing to USE it as money because it is extremely efficient. It satisfies those certain needs for money that neither Gold, nor the Dollar can. And as more people come to understand that it serves those uses, more people will choose it also. Its value comes from peoples desire to USE it as money...which is the SAME place the value of Gold comes from. This is what you are failing to comprehend. The value of Bitcoin will not just up and disappear one day becuase its value is not arbitrary, it comes from its "use value" as money. Money is a tool and Bitcoin is a high precision machine for the 21st century.

There are currencies all over the world and throughout history that fluctuate wildly in price and yet are still used. Just because something is the norm (stable price) does not mean it is a prerequisite.
Then you move on to a circular argument that it must FIRST be used as a currency to achieve stability. ..which you precluded in the first paragraph...so that according to you nothing could ever achieve currency status because it would first need to be stable.

To be Satan, you have to first be an Angel (or one of the "chosen ones"), this would have to be an early adopter or Foundation member. Then you have to rebel against God or the Creator, and deceive Mankind.
My candidate for this position is Brock Pierce. He is an early adopter, a member of the Foundation and is now pushing his bull shit Dollar backed "realcoin" (if there ever was a doublespeak), which is a direct rebellion against the Creator of Bitcoin. And if ANY of the other allegations against him are also true this puts him up there for those reasons alone.

True...he did say he doesn't know. I personally believe this is just a ploy to avoid the subject. 
A key idea in "Anti-Fragility" that he repeats many times...Positive Black Swans are much more difficult to predict than negative ones, and making predictions about Positive ones is a fool's game. And so I believe he is just following his own advice about not making positive Black Swan predictions, while simultaneously cheering Bitcoin silently. 
Also in Anti-Fragility he basically endorses Bitcoin with this idea, summarized "If someone uses more than one argument against an idea, you know the argument is bullshit." When was the last time you heard someone say, "Bitcoin will fail because X reason"? Nope, it is always, "Bitcoin is stupid and will fail because X,Y,Z, etc." They never stop at one, because one is not sufficient.

I'm very interested in your opinion if you're being serious because I have yet to come across a person such as yourself.
Here is my question. Do you think Dollars have value? If yes, then do you attribute them value solely becuase other people do or for other reasons? If yes, then isn't it irrelevant what value you attribute to Bitcoins and only what others choose over the long term? 
And obviously thinks that over time most people will choose to give Bitcoin value. If that happens, will you then think Bitcoin has value?
If you're arguing that other people will not choose to give Bitcoins value over the long term that is sort of a different question. If this is the case, why would it not gain market share in cross border transactions of money at the very least? It is cheaper, all cheaper systems replace older systems.

If people could have chosen a decentralized system of accounting to move from barter to trade, they would have. But no 3rd party could be trusted, so they chose the next best thing, Gold. Gold ACTS as an accounting system because each unit is the same and can not be easily fudged. It is also hard to create new units inside this accounting system. But Gold is not perfect. It is slightly inflationary and can not be sent over wires. Bitcoin improves on Gold in many ways. 
We think of commodity money as the best option, because it always has been. But there is no universal law that says money must be a commodity, it is just that before Bitcoin there was no way to facilitate trade with a decentralized accounting system. Now we have that in Bitcoin and alts. If people could have chosen a system like this 5000 years ago, they would have and Gold would not even be an afterthought.

No it was just a long-winded way to say you think people keeping money at home are dumb. And that you don't like Bitcoin security features. Which I guess are both fine perspectives, but you went a long way to make the points, which aren't related to the thread very much.

ok true. But it is not the rarest metal, so that can not be the explanation as to why Gold was chosen.

The CPI calculations changed dramatically in 90s and ever since has understated the real inflation rate. Every one with power and money prefers this because the richer you are the easier it is to escape/protect against inflation with strategic investing.
You properly adjusted it for official inflation...but the real inflation needs to be another multiple of ~8 to get near the price of that house...now I'm not saying that the "real" rate is 8 times higher than the official rate because like you said other things around the house have changed as well. But I think that real rate is somewhere between the official and the rate necessary to get to that high price the owner is asking for.

Well, sort of. I agree the word has history, but you were saying what it "meant", which is incorrect. As far as "n*****", being a similar word, I would say not quite. It is correct that the word finds its root in the Latin word for black, "niger". I am not offend by either word, though I realize that some people are. But either way it does not change the meaning of either word.

He didn't sell his name. He sold his services for wages...just like I presume you do and I do everyday. He didn't have access to, or knowledge of the business activities of the company (nor does any typical technical advisor to any company).
Having said that, I agree that it would nice if Andreas would answer the community's questions. He is a trusted figure and to keep that status, which in my estimation is not damaged by these events, he should share what knowledge he does have.

No, bc of the Prisoner's dilemma. Even though there may be some people who want to use a different coin for ideological reasons, they are out weighed by greed. Bitcoin will continue to win because the monetary incentive to mine, use, accept etc. is larger than any other coin.
edit (add): also, that article is horse shite because many people own many bitcoins spread out over hundreds of wallets. Making it appear as if there are many poor individuals, when that's not necessarily the whole picture.

All value is subjective to the human mind. Subjective theory of value described by Carl Menger. "Intrinsic Value" is just a euphemism for something that has high utility value, or strong history of consistent value.

I did misspeak by implying that all transactions are greater fool, only a subset are. The ones where the buyer perceives a lower "personal utility value" for the item than the general public. Thus relying on what he believes is a miscalculation of the prevailing price.

By asking that question, you've effectively proven you should not open an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:46:28
Ok. You're right about most that...
But what "keeps you from starving" is not the dollar bill itself, but rather the greater fool theory at work in the mind of the shop keeper. He trusts in the dollar system, and is in constant game of exchanging dollars for good and goods for dollar always believing he will benefit from those transactions. There is nothing objectively stopping bitcoin from performing a similar function (given shopkeeper adoption).
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:10:24
Ok, but dividends are paid from earnings. Earnings are the result buying goods (Land, Labor, and Capital) at a price and then reselling them on the market for a higher price...thus the greater fool theory. Yes, there is usually (though not always) a function performed in the interim, but it is still a speculation that those actions will lead to a higher future selling price, or a greater fool.

I also didn't deny that there are large owner's. You then assert that this problem will get worse with time, but you can not prove that, nor can you know the future. If you can prove it, I would like to read your paper on why this will be so.
