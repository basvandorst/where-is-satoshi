Can you elaborate on the legal problem? I'm a lawyer and have been looking to do a little cryptocurrency legal activism.

Interesting thought experiment. Though I can't imagine the NSA vaporizing an entire sector of the finance economy (lots of respectable investors now) just for the shits of ruining bitcoin.

You can also directly convert Doge for US dollars at Vault of Satoshi now.

There needs to be an easier way to convert fiat to crypto. There's a hydraulic effect where we cut out the annoyance of the Visa/PayPal middleman which is good for businesses and replaced it with a Coinbase middleman which is annoying for consumers. So much for the beauty of cryptos... until we can minimize the fiat conversion transaction costs.

Actually I would **love** to work for EFF, but my background is animal law not patent law so they would likely reject me.
Spitcoin rhymes with spitcoin. And "split" is the opposite of of "bit". Get it?

Well the coin increase is fixed by units not by percentage -- so it will only be 5% the first year, then 4.8% or so, and so forth until it approaches zero on a long enough time scale.
Also, you are assuming that the growth of dogecoin keeps pace with population growth. However, if the crypto took off, then I expect that the number of new users would vastly exceed population growth for the first several years. See, e.g., Facebook. Thus, the extra coins would just marginally decrease the rate of deflation.
Which brings up an interesting point about cryptocurrencies in general: the rate of coin production is fixed. I think a superior cryptocurrency would have some federal reserve bank equivalent to set the rate of coin production at the same level as the increase in new users so that the currency  neither gains nor loses value. Kind of like Goldilocks's porridge. Too much inflation and nobody wants to accept your coins since they will be worth less a week later. Too much deflation and nobody wants to spend their coins since they will be worth more a week later. There needs to be a non-arbitrary mechanism to aim for the sweet spot inbetween.

I agree wholeheartedly. I started at Dogecoin but got sick of it and now subscribe to and buy Bitcoin (though admittedly *very* little due to the steep price). There's a very friendly and intelligent community here!

Good observation. Different rules can apply under different circumstances and you never really quite know until you open a dialogue with a lawyer about your very specific issue(s). The C.F.R. links I provided should lead to a whole body of regulations that can be sifted through that might provide OP with additional guidance particular to his circumstances.

Best comment so far.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:16:16
Really? Somebody tipped me in bitcoins on earlier today. Very disparity. So unwow.
P.S. I subscribed to the dogecoin sub after the Jamaica bobsled story broke, but it got me to buy a few satoshis and subscribe to this bitcoin sub a few days later. Just one anecdote of symbitosis. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:18:47
I see bitcoin being crypto gold to dogecoin (or some other's) currency. Who wouldn't want a slice of the small pie that started it all?

We need a lawsuit to compel a deposition under oath. That's the only way to truly sort of verify what happened.

Okay, dug up some of the federal regulations. [29 C.F.R. § 531.27]( generally requires that "prescribed wages" (i.e. minimum wage and overtime required by law) be paid in "cash or negotiable instrument payable at par." As I understand it, the legal question is whether Bitcoin is "at par" with cash. If a Bitcoin-paying employer was ever sued by the Department of Labor, a U.S. Attorney, or a disgruntled employee, then this question could go either way depending on the judge and quality of legal council. In my opinion the safest route would be to pay the minimum wage, overtime, and any other legally-mandated wages in dollars, and only use Bitcoins for wages you pay that are above-and-beyond the legally requirements. You could also contact the federal agency and ask for guidance, or even submit a citizen's petition for rulemaking to DOL to clarify that Bitcoins are allowed for wage payment (*see* [5 U.S.C. § 553(e)]( which you are legally entitled to do under the Administrative Procedure Act. I am not a labor law attorney and did not conduct exhaustive research so do not rely on this as legal advice without consulting an attorney that can conduct more specific research into any issues. Also, I just looked at the federal regulations and not any state labor law requirements or other laws. 
**Edit:** For a little more clarity, [29 C.F.R. § 531.34]( provides some examples of inappropriate ways to pay wages:


Cryptocurrency is not addressed. A more specific legal question for us under the Fair Labor Standards Act is whether cryptocurrency is more like a dollar or more like a coupon.

Dogecoin's value is mass appeal and big spending. Adding a few billion extra coins a year in perpetuity enhances rather than diminishes its value as a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:20:08
Still a little awkward to call them "micro bitcoins" or whatever. It's not natural to say that "I make fifty kilodollars a year" or whatever.

Overstock.com is experimenting with this by providing a 1% credit to all bitcoin purchases.

Depends on what powers a global government has. I certainly wouldn't mind one that can freeze the global assets of member states who initiate warfare. Or one that guides human space exploration.

[Dogecoin Just Solved A Problem That Bitcoin Is Going To Face](
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:38:45
I would look into federal and state labor laws. There might be an issue here about paying in non-dollar currency. For example, if a restaurant provides a free meal at the end of a shift, can they count that towards an hourly wage? There could be some issues with Bitcoin's volatility as well. How pissed would your employee be if you paid him or her $1,000 in Bitcoin for their paycheck, the price of Bitcoin plummeted 40% that weekend, and now your employee can't make rent. Might come back to bite you in the ass.

Well the founders purposefully decided not to fix it two nights ago. So now the inflation is purposeful.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:25:56
You are improperly conflating coin production with inflation. 
Just because doge is going to keep producing more coins doesn't mean it will lose value. As long as the market cap keeps pace with the rate of coin production then the value of doge will remain constant. It's conceivable that the market cap may exceed the rate of coin production in which case there would actually be deflation, although the deflation would be less than if no coins were produced. The month of January is a perfect example of this. We started the month with doge at like 50 satoshis per doge, and, although we added billions of doges last month, the market cap exploded and the value of doge is now three to four times higher. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:14:54
I drove up the price of bitcoins earlier today when I bought some... so that I could turn around and buy doges. Just one example of DOGE having a small effect on the BTC market.

Holy shit - people in their tweens are using cryptocurrencies? Crazy kids. Back when I was that age, I was playing Number Munchers and goofing around on dial-up AOL chat on an old Gateway 2000 computer.
