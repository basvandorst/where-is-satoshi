Funny how after failing to predict the future in that internal memo, Western Union went on to be a major influential and successful company in its field, and stay in business for almost 150 years, pivoting several times to meet industry developments.
(Also, it was *this* telephone -- ie. the apparatus at the time, which did have significant limits in a business sense -- not *the* telephone as a concept.)

You could say a similar thing about bitcoin evangelists who wade in to every finance, payments or economics conversation with "Bitcoin user not affected!" or "Shoulda used bitcoin!" or "Banish the banks, bitcoin is the future!"
Or those on reddit in particular who leap on every crowdsourcing or fundraising drive -- or even just sad stories -- to show off their tipping skills.
Or those who hijack AMAs to get a Notable Person to say something positive about bitcoin, so they can then go and write half a dozen blog posts about it and submit them all here to keep the hypemill turning.

You are missing the point, a bit, I think.
 It isn't designed to be an expertly researched and explained article. It is part of the Deb Amlen's "Buzzology" column, which is described like this:
*Every week, it seems there's another viral, hot, buzzy Internet meme. A YouTube video. A dance craze. Absurd terminology. Also each week, Yahoo Tech's Deb Amlen arrives to explain it, for your cocktail-conversation pleasure.*
*"For your cocktail-conversation pleasure."* The column is supposed to be from the viewpoint of somebody who is, in tech or online terms, a bit dinosaury, and just wants an overview they can vaguely understand.
It's meant to contain snark, a bit of "What's it all about?" ignorance, and humor. You might not find the humor funny, but unless you go to cocktail parties and talk about things "the kids" are doing on the internet, then you're not the target audience.
Why is this important? Because people were writing articles and columns like this about every tech innovation -- "On the internet nobody knows you're a dog", etc -- up until the point those tech innovations were just part of our everyday lives. So the presence of these articles is some kind of indicator of how far bitcoin has come and how far it has to go.

So PayPal probably does have some legal rights to freeze assets.
Furthermore, in the EU, PayPal *is* registered as a bank, based in Luxembourg.
And in Australia, it is registered as a deposit institution, which means it is subject to banking regulation.

... except when it comes to streaming media (music, movies), there is also the whole minefield of copyright and distribution rights for different geographical territories. 
The media industry companies that produce the films and TV series often sell distribution rights for each geographical region separately, to maximize revenue.
I would say these are bigger issues for Netflix than payment methods. Netflix is available in the UK, but its selection is not as big as that in the USA. There's no technical reason why. It's rights issues.

... and you are still wrong to say that it will always be going up. 
"Past performance does not indicate future results."
Lots of things could take place that would cause bitcoin to go down and never recover.
You might think these things unlikely, and you might be right. But they still exist, so you should not make blanket, X-will-always-be-true statements.

Seriously loaded response options. 
The following options aren't available:
- interested in bitcoin, don't think it will last, prefer traditional currency
- not interested in bitcoin, do think it will last, prefer traditional currency
You offer other categories on that opinion matrix, so why not those two?
You seem to be more interested in reasons why people aren't interested, since there are more "No" options, so I suggest a two-part question. First ask "Would you like to be paid in BTC?" (Yes / no / maybe) and then, if no or maybe, a "Select all that apply" follow-up for reasons why.

For me, the big statement in this piece is this one:
**The European Banking Authority warned last month that consumers were not protected by any refund rights under EU law when using virtual currencies for commercial transactions.**
I had missed this. I had suspected it but not seen it confirmed. 
It means I would be very unlikely in future to use bitcoin to buy any non-trivial goods or services.

Hi, great site. Love the design and map interface. (Is it custom or based on a framework?)
Great that you are accepting user submissions. You might want a note on the submissions page clarifying that you're looking for "legal and regulatory" permissiveness, as opposed to market permissiveness.
For example, in the UK and to some extent the US, several banks appear to want nothing to do with bitcoin. There have been reports of them being hostile towards account holders with bitcoin activity. This is even though there is technically nothing in the current legal and regulatory frameworks against bitcoin itself.
I can see a situation where people might submit "Bank accounts closed down because bitcoin", which is (as far as I can tell) not what you're site's about.

The Uniform Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), a process setup by ICANN, which regulates .com domain names, might disagree with you.
Although their "bad faith" elements (one of three needed for a complaint to succeed), talks about intentions at the time of registration, the UDRP is made mandatory when you register a domain administered by ICANN and includes a line that the registration *"will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party"*.
If Mt Gox is trademarked in any way, it's arguable that rights *are* being infringed upon. They may be even without a trademark.
**edit to add**: Mt Gox does have a live trademark,  so I would say there is a case.

Although I think this submission is good quality content, I have downvoted this because of the title. It's overly editorialised to the point where it reveals nothing about the linked article.
For a moment I thought it was a direct quotation from the article, and was very surprised to see such comments in a mainstream newspaper.
When I clicked through, I realised I had, in essence, been duped.
Why not use a descriptive title -- *"Irish Central Bank issues warning about bitcoin"* -- and leave your sensationalised conclusions in a comment?
It is it easier and kinder for people who scan the list of links, looking for something to read, if they know what vaguely what they are going to get. It's tiresome having to parse a bunch of multi-line, heavily-opinionated titles.

Michael Lewis has written a lot about Wall Street and the recent financial crisis.
Stephanie Flanders (formerly of the BBC) and Robert Peston (still of the BBC) don't appeal to everyone, but they've done a lot to explain the inticracies of the finance world in terms easy enough for the layman.
Gillian Tett of the Financial Times writes very clearly and saw the financial crisis coming long before many others.
I have learned more from reading and listening to all of the above than I ever have from Max Keiser. (And I have given him a go.) 
I'm not saying Max Keiser doesn't know anything. I just find his hectoring, know-all, told-you-so attitude and his immature, shock-jock language completely unappealing. He acts like a demagogue.
I find it hard to actually learn anything from him. I don't want listen to a man who paints everything in extreme terms. Comparing the eurozone to a "Fourth Reich", for example, which is inappropriate and insensitive, in my view.

(That's why I included the European Union: lots of legislation there covers more than one country.)
You yourself talk about "posting about laws in a country with a fraction of the population".
So the native language of the visitors to is not the issue. The issue is labelling US-centric posts to help non-US visitors, of which there are many, and maybe more than US-based visitors.
In any case, "native English speakers" is disingenuous. You don't need to be a native speaker to read reddit. Lots of people in the world are fluent, can speak or read, in more than one language.
India has more than 100 million people who can speak English. Pakistan has nearly 90 million. English is a very popular language for learners worldwide.
