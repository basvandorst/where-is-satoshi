As long as it is understood that the comment was sarcastic, has no basis in real life, and will never be the case.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:45:42
You Dont need an exchange to get bitcoins...  You Dont understand that a lot of people dont have access to banks?
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:56:27
So your company lied about your sales?

I thought it was Steven seagal
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:10:10
Hmmm how does one fail at failure... Isn't that called success?  Go back to the jungle you bonobo.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:20:26
Yes... The criminal who is trying to steal cash finds cash inside a bitcoin atm and is dissapointed....  I'm sorry how does this comment make sense.  I'm assuming the 30 upvotes are charity?
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:24:23
What's your point?
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:10:12
Why the fuck do we need people to keep telling us that bitcoin haters are wrong.  It's just the same arguments over and over again.  At this point , if you are still needing reassurance, you may have downs syndrome.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:30:44
Sarcasm is doing something that you don't really mean as a joke.  Are you saying the comment was sarcastic and everyone knows the criminal will be thrilled when he finds lots of cash?
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:03:40
Thanks bruh.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:37:40
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I had not understood the altcoin scams till you educated me with this meme.  Please continue to share more, as I can't wait for your next post.
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:11:41
Only the weak apologize for something they believe in.  That is what makes me cringe.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:36:12
Haha haha.  By all means, pick the genes of whatever bonobo you want.....  Hahahahahahahahahahaha seriously though..  thanks for the laugh.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:01:22
You should educate yourself before you form opinions.  This is a valuable skill in life.  The fact that no government can destroy your bitcoin savings and people without Access to banking now have a way into the market is reason enough.  The fact that you didnt consider this made me hesitant to reply.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:41:20
Lol who actually thought this guy was satoshi?  People are so small brained.  Go back to the jungle you bonobos.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:30:25
I remember my journalism professors told me to make sure my information was correct..... How lovely.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:39:20
Thanks for letting me know.  I was just about to sell them all and then I read this post.  Thank you bitcoin Muhammad.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:39:53
Why do people care what I ask you?
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:19:34
I gave a lot of thought to that insult.  You're certainly not as dumb as a lion or a tiger, but certainly not nearly as smart as a human,  so I used a relatively smart  primate.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:04:28
The fact that you're so butt hurt means that you are probably a bitcoin circle jerker.  Keep reading my comments,  I can't wait for you to realize that you were stupid before you read them.

It sounds like he got hit with that virus that encrypts information on your computer, unless you pay the ransom...

Works 80% of the time , all the time..
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:07:49
It wasnt until i became passionate about bitcoin that i began to understand how uneducated or corrupt the media is.  You have my sentiments Erik.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:46:29
Cool dude.  Thanks for letting me know how you felt about closing your PayPal account.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:03:19
Sorry, I must have a higher standard of comedy.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:35:27
Servers don't claim 15% of their tips,  they claim 15-20% of their total sales as tips.  They would never get away with 15% claims on their tips.

Im on the edge of my seat.

Yeah! Just start a revolution.

Thank you for letting us know how you feel about cnn.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:51:37
Why does this have 500 upvotes.. I wish I giggled at retarded shit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:13:04
First of all, nobody in their right mind thinks that cryptocurrency, with Its current acceptance, will change the financial systems.  As it grows in popularity, you wont need exchanges to get them.  You dont need them now, but they help.  So what if poor people dont spend a lot of money?  It makes their micro transactions a lot more profitable, and allows them access to the internet economy.  First its good for the poor and small businesses.  As the price stabalizes and becomes more popular, it will be better for storing your wealth.  Even now it out performs a lot of currencies plagued with hyper inflation.  It sounds like you dont see a world outside of America.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:29:51
Thanks for letting us know what your dad thinks.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:21:18
Thanks for letting me know.  I was getting worried that only I knew about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:27:48
I bet this is related to the silk road.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:29:55
I get it.. People traded drugs on silk road,  he comes back and has blood shot eyes... Did he do some drugs?  That's so funny because it's true.  +9000

Perhaps Im missing something, but who provides infrastructure, like fiber optics and what not.

Thats not a gox.. this is a gox!!
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:49:13
IMHO, we should be able to say what we want.  Whether or not the publicity is good, fuck is just a word.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:24:22
I didnt find this funny at all, and i didnt even have money in mtgox.
