i don't understand your logic, you're saying JUST use the extra energy to mine bitcoins? why not JUST buy huge batteries and store the energy there and then ship the batteries to energy deficient areas? coz it's cost inefficient and wasteful that's why.   
maybe if unlimited energy existed in the form of fusion your logic would make sense but with limited reserves it's kinda kooky

except there's tons of energy lost in mining bitcoin and then mining again to confirm transactions(transfer of energy in this example)   
would be cheaper to just pay to transfer the energy directly via oil pipelines or coal shipments

while there are a couple of startups in india letting you buy and sell crytpo, i don't think the reserve bank of india has officially weighed in on the legality of cryptocurrencies. kinda has a cooling effect on it.

 you obviously wouldn't leave the actual private keys in the will. that'd be like putting your bank account password in your will. probably a safety deposit box with the usb containing the actual keys   
you guys act as if death should be a seamless experience with no one helping people deal with the transfers of property

yeah they'll just magically find the keys, the 1locker password to their account, know what kinda service to use the password for etc etc

doubt they'd want to
