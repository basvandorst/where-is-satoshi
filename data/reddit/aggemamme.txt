They are just annoying to use (wait for camera to be ready, point it, focus, all adds up some seconds) and ugly. Contactless small-value transactions can currently be done in a matter of 0.5-1 second, Bitcoin shouldn't lag behind in this regard.

Cash just gets crumbled, gets lost, is annoying to use, can be stolen easily. It's a bad solution for payments.

Same in Denmark, Iceland, and I'd suppose Sweden. Takes 6-10 seconds. Less in Iceland where they don't care about pin or signature.

So you agree cash sucks, but you carry it out of necessity sometimes? Then cash shouldn't be the "goal" or solution to make Bitcoin payments successful.

It would be great if you could publish it on F-droid, or alternatively post an .apk! This way you don't need to subscribe to Google to use the app.

Note how the ink/toner of some other text can be seen near the bottom address (this corresponds to where the paper was folded in 3).
I noticed that prints from pc2paper.co.uk have this same 'glitch'; perhaps they are using them for the letter sending? Or perhaps it's a common issue with mass-scale letter printers/folders

I thought we were comparing with the "QR installed base" which requires some sort of smartphone and camera.
Contactless payments are just so much nicer and quicker than QR codes, chip-and-pin, manually typing URLs, or cash.

How could they?

"Kash" I think. The Danish one was "DanMønt".

Would be nicer to get rid of cash altogether, not revert back to it.

Right, only around 500,000,000 phones...

A single click will do! :D

In my country too, but that's a shitty interest you get.

Nice thanks!!

In a lot of countries, rent is collected by the landlord in cash.

Received this one as well.

Capi-Lux runs these stores in CPH and AMS, amongst other places.

That's what I already did once when a rental car broke down. Drive-now operates a fleet of hundreds of cars here in Copenhagen. I'd leave it and grab the nearest other available car.

Of course I'd push it out of the way if it was possible. And their customer care will take care of it, or call roadside service.
That's no different from calling roadside service yourself.

[Here's a sort of Bitcoin graffiti mural]( I saw in Kiev, Ukraine around a month back. It seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin shop.

So the RPC password was dumped in the clear, but since it listens on localhost only I bet it's not the biggest deal in the world. OR IS IT?

"In a specific case, the Danish FSA has approved that a company doesn't need a permission to establish themselves in the country in order to do business exchanging real currency with the so-called virtual currency, including Bitcoin, and vice versa."

Here's a real translation. Source: I'm Danish.
**Warning against virtual currencies (bitcoin, etc.)**
The European Banking Authority, EBA, has issued a warning to consumers against virtual currencies, including bitcoin. The Danish FSA supports this warning.
In the warning, EBA notifies the consumers about a number of risks associated with buying, selling, and owning the virtual currencies:
- You risk to lose your virtual currency on a market exchange.
- You risk that your virtual currency will get stolen from your electronic wallet.
- You have no assurance that you will be able to use virtual currency as a means of payment in the future, or that you will be able to exchange back to real currency.
- The value of your virtual currencies can change very rapidly, and can in principle become zero.
- Virtual currencies can be used for criminal activities.
Purchase and sale of virtual currencies may have consequences on taxes and levies.
Bitcoin has recently been an object of certain media attention. There is no public data about the prevalence or extent of the trade of Bitcoin or other virtual currencies in Denmark.
The Danish FSA has assessed that virtual currency is not subject to the current financial regulations in Denmark. In a specific case, the Danish FSA has thus approved that a company doesn't need a permission to establish themselves in the country in order to do business exchanging real currency with the so-called virtual currency, including Bitcoin, and vice versa.
This was based on the fact that the Danish FSA judged that the activity could neither be viewed as issuance of electronic monies, supply of payment services, currency exchange, receipt of deposits, or stockbroking, and that the activity thus is not subject to the financial regulation.
**Background information about virtual currencies**
Virtual currencies are a kind of unregulated electronic money, which as opposed to real money is not issued and guaranteed by a central bank, and which in some cases can be used as a means of payment.
Virtual currencies have emerged in many different kinds; first in connection with on-line gambling/gaming activities and in social networks. Later, virtual currencies have evolved to be used as alternatives to real currency.
Bitcoin is the most widespread virtual currency, but also LiteCoin, ZeroCoin, and Linden Dollar could be mentioned as the more well-known ones.
Bitcoin are today being exchanged with real currency and is increasingly being accepted as a means of payment, both on-line and off-line in the regular economy when purchasing goods and services.
