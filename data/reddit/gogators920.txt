I was clearly just confused since I just started doing this bitcoin stuff. that's why I put "Noob" in the title.
 
sorry for ruining your night man

it's all good man. people just advise you to transfer your coins to your own wallet so that you actually "own" your coins. 
While coinbase says you have your own BTC/ETH/LTC wallet, it's just a wallet on their exchange. You don't fully own those coins until you grab them off of the exchange. blockchain seems to be an easy wallet that i've heard people use.
IMO, don't freak out about having your coins on coinbase, it's just risky if something goes wrong and they lose all your coin, then you could be screwed. If you have your coins in a wallet and coinbase goes splat, then you're fine. That's all, you didn't do anything wrong

i've seen people say that coinbase is fine to use, but to just keep your coins off of the exchange itself, in your own personal wallet. I've seen people have problems with coinbase as you said but I, myself, have never had a problem with them whatsoever in about 2 years.
I have read here tho that transferring your funds to GDAX (who is owned by coinbase) is a better idea. GDAX avoids the high fees you'll pay when buying and selling on coinbase
