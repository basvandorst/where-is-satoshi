In other news, Coinbase CEO says they may never answer your calls if demand continues to grow.

I think Bitcoin vets are the people collecting the coins that fell out when the ride looped. My cost average is under $1000 but I regret not selling high and using that money on these swings. If you can invest in something that swings 30%+ in this short period of time you can beat the stock market by just trading the swings.   
If I was to do that with a stock broker he will charge me to buy and sell and on top of that I need the investment to swing up bigger than analytical data projected.

Exactly, if you sell Umbrella's you need a good marketing person who knows about the sun.

what happened? I was watching the  DOW crash and must have missed

We did it the other way. When PayPal was just a product and not the fucked up monster it is today it needed to do more than just allow friends to settle up lunch with digital cash. Merchant processing was ignoring or had banned a certain set of merchants. It wasn't like they did not want to take payments, they were just not serviced or had a questionable business. So we started with members of the team putting items up for sale that were PayPal only but on eBay. We did not think we could or want to recreate a marketplace to conduct transactions, we wanted to show people an alternative way to be paid or pay. There was no square back then, it was the big guys, the gih risk players and really no one else.   
In many ways I see the same here. Maybe not with this system but with Bitcoin. With PayPal we still had to wire or send you checks. Merchants can settle Bitcoin like they do credit cards so it is better.

This is pretty big. When PayPal was a company called Confinity this was one of the applications we felt was possible. In the aerospace industry they sell a hundred million in jets. They use expensive escrow systems that require several steps to release funds. Importing works similar, the shipping party wants to be paid FOB you want to know it was done. So the banks, freight carriers etc all have systems created and they are all adding cost and humans. Thus causing timing delays and timing is everything when dealing with interchange. A bitcoin solution could create a like for like currency swap treated like a lock box transaction. All parties meet the requirements and BTC is release at the ACV. 
I am not sure if anyone can do this cheaper.

Have traveled with lots of money and never heard this. If you are coming in internationally they have declaration forms but interstate travel?

To be fair, you only lose when you sell at a loss. Holding is not a loss, unless you lock it in by selling. We do not know what happens in the future. What if Beanie Babies become popular in China and people are willing to buy those for $500 each? He just bought several college educations. The minute he tosses them out, stops treating them like something with an upside he has lost.

I would love that. I could short your stock and maybe start my own Amazon. We would take Crypto like we do credit cards, expect a USD cash settlement within 24 hours and under 2.75%.

So many people overly invested in other peoples holdings. You do you I will do me.

Actually this is not totally the case. I have tested it myself using eTrade and Scottrade. In the small caps and OTC the market makers will take trades and not fill orders. The Canadian exchanges have way more transperancy. 
I would put orders out to sell and use odd small numbers 327 or things like that and at some point during the day you see the trades go off on level II. Refreshing your account over and over and your order reads pending. Market Makers may not even fill your order at all that day. If you ask the trading desk they will tell you the order was not filled. Yet the tape shows it. Market makers can naked short stocks. Online trading houses show the full trade to the market makers so they know what the overhang is and the buy side demand is. They have the ability to manipulate at their leisure. It is not rare to see wholesale market makers working in coordinated efforts to block stocks from any natural trading patterns. The Canadian exchange show the buy and sell side demand to buyer and seller along with the market makers. 
TLDR; Traditional electronic trading systems can be manipulated and lack transperancy
