can we do this through the website?

My gf was pretty sceptical for this one but I think I won her over in my local Starbucks when it worked..still have to convince her that about bitcoin though 😂

If you reply to someone's comment it'll tip them, if you just leave it as a regular comment it tips the channel.

We're relatively small compared to networks like Maker Studios, Machinima etc. but we've gotten pretty big and we just passed our first year back in October! We just hit 450million monthly views  across the network.
Here's a list of some of the top users with us: 
We have a lot of partners from countries like Vietnam and Philippines  where Western Union is the only option for them, so we look forward to saving them some fees! :D
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:12:46
Don't think it'll be accepted, journalists aren't allowed to be influenced by m oney when writing news. Also there was a journalist a year or two ago on here that was tipped a huge amount of bitcoin that's worth thousands now, but I assume it was never accepted either.
@_date: 2014-12-29 12:25:34
You can do that also, however this is earnings based on the actual video views and the adverts that are displayed on them.
Changetip is great too for tips through comments, but you have to depend on your audience's generosity in that case.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:52:31
the second post on the front page is discussing the price.

You're an animator too? Wow there's actually a lot of us animators on this subreddit! Woo!
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:13:09
This isn't a big deal, it's just one of those tiny laptop repair shops in dublin... Last time i went by their shop, they didn't even have a bitcoin accepted here sign
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:21:13
Lol damn you autocorrect!
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:14:45
For 2D animation, the easiest and most common is Adobe Flash! 
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:55:32
No, your article still literally ends halfway through a sentence.
"Note: I also asked about whether they buy bitcoin, and they said no. So if you’re looking for someone to buy your bitcoins, your best Irish bet is still "
I assume it's meant to say '..still localbitcoins'
People are curious about bitcoin but when i got my phone repaired he was shocked i wanted to pay with bitcoin. He said i was the second person ever to pay by it. ( they've been offering bitcoin for nearly a year by the time i went in)
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:59:14
Still no bitcoin option to pay for the worldwide shipping site of overstock :( Also the tax to deliver to ireland on a $450 tv is $200 ouch
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:37:50
find a local bitcoin atm.
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:55:05

@_date: 2014-11-25 16:14:41
It's nice, but what would be the easiest way to turn it into fiat (let's face it 99% of newcomers want to change it into their common currency)
@_date: 2014-10-11 21:55:48
they set up a 9 acre camp for homeless people called satoshi's forest, provided something like 30,000 meals through bitcoin, and he ran across America over 4 months raising awareness for bitcoin and his charity! I thought it deserved a shoutout anyway
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:29:02
it's more a case of the laws in individual countries, hence why overstock is taking so long to roll out international bitcoin payments
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:36:27
got a link?
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:55:25

Yes! Was very slow at loading I was surprised I got it!
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:57:18
That makes sense but I'd say if a network wide catastrophe did happen to bitcoin, any other cryptocurrency would have a hard time regaining traction since nobody would trust them!
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:21:56
no tips for you!

@_date: 2014-02-20 13:38:08
Looks great. Sometimes I forget that there's a huge community out there of people from all sorts of backgrounds.
I plan to attend a bitcoin meetup in ireland next week for the first time.

Is this still happening?? :O
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:33:55
I got my phone repaired there with bitcoin. They're  quite over prices but since there's hardly anywhere in dublin now, what option do we have. The baggot inn has since stopped accepting bitcoin.
You article ends halfway through a sentence....
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:10:59
I appreciate the effort but her camera is slightly out of focus and the vocals need to be mastered or touched up as it sounds a bit grainy at the moment. But I'm sure she's done this all herself so I can't complain! Good job! :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:19:35
Tastypic and OP are the reasons I'm so excited about Bitcoin.

Am I the only one sick of all these alt coins popping up?
Bitcoin is confusing enough for the general public, these things aren't helping much. Why can't we stick to one cryptocurrency and refine that until it's perfect? What's the point in doge and coinye and all the others? Someone please enlighten me!
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:57:13
That's a great idea! I think i'll tip them on twitter, might be easier, and all their followers can see too.

Great to see bitcoin being used this way rather than the extravagant ways that make the news. Maybe reuters will pick up on this, they're pretty good at that!
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:39:48
To be honest I think one of the most popular pubs in Ireland accepting bitcoin is bigger news, coupled with the fact that they're installing a bitcoin atm in the pub too. Geeks would already be going to this posts store, but a pub caters to everyone, and is a way better way to create buzz about btc.
Here's the pub! 
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:27:31
You're lucky, here in ireland there's literally nothing! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:43:00

Are you paying in BTC? If so consider crossposting to @_date: 2014-12-12 14:35:53

There are twitter bots and sms bots that do it but I think the reddit one is the most widely used forum type bot anyway.

Goddamit. I was planning to go there. Now there's no pubs in Ireland that accept it and only one food place in Dublin . And this one got loads of publicity for being the first place in Ireland to sell a Guinness for bitcoin .

Wow in the same room I graduated in last September! And circle will be there? Great news.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:18:02
Maybe post it to Twitter and Facebook too. Agoda are a great site  , I used them for Thailand 
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:33:56
Yeah noticed this yesterday too. They're also selling the 'highly collectible' physical copper bitcoins too for 5euro a pop. Meanwhile they're ten cent each on ebay.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:35:39
Why male models?
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:03:03

Tiny transaction fees, instant payments. It allows people to be their own bank as it were.

@_date: 2014-01-30 11:44:43
Does everyone here have a gilded comment?!
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:30:09
Yeah I'm currently editing a new showreel, but you can see lots of videos I made on the 'Animations' tab.
[Here's the direct link!] (
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:31:18
They were more interested in the fact I created animations and illustrations in exchange for bitcoin . It created an income for me when there was no jobs after I graduated, and I landed some awesome connections through it. I got hired by [Tapeke]( (bitcoin personal finance management application)to do lots of art for them which wouldn't have been possible had I not accepted btc. They want to hear " my experiences with the bitcoin movement." So I have a good feeling that the general attitude towards bitcoin is getting more positive... Regardless of my satirical toon ;)
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:35:22
I'm in ireland, and I wouldn't recommend buying from these guys. I would however recommend  , much more professional, and priced properly.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:09:49
I'm pretty sure they've openly expressed enthusiasm for bitcoin and dogecoin in the past
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:53:24
Very interesting, I hadn't heard of this yet. Good work, I plan to use this! 
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:44:31
I use multibit and never had any problems with it. 
I had a query yesterday about them removing mtgox from the live ticker the have and within minutes one of the developers replied to me right here in this subreddit, so that's a plus!
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:32:47
or check out  :)

And their website still has a big section on bitcoin, are you sure they've stopped?

Good on ya!

I know nothing about upgrading to mavericks, do you know if I install it will everything I have on my computer be lost? Like my adobe suite and bitcoins etc.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:50:15
This is huge. I've been on fiverr for two years, it a great place to order stuff. 
I even have a fiverr page where I do testimonials! 
I remember messaging fiverr months ago about bitcoin and they said they were looking into it, I'm very surprised that wasn't an empty claim!
Although I'd wish they'd integrate the option to withdraw bitcoin if you're a seller, because currently paypal takes a cut from your earnings. Which sucks because for every fiverr you earn the website takes $1 of it already.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:21:45
I can sell you some if you want.
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:52:38
Looks great. Do you guys need a proper animated explainer video? Check out my site.

This whole thing is depressing. Look how easy one of the top exchanges can just plummet and not  be trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:31:43
Surely you're joking
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:13:25
They already take $1, from the gig seller. I sell gigs on fiverr, and you only get $4per gig and then it takes a PayPal fee when you withdraw it. It's a pretty bad system.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:52:52
a heist sequence where a team of savvy teen hackers take over millions of bitcoins but get greedy and kill each other over who gets to keep it. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 10:52:22
well i have osx 10.6.8 and it requires 10.7, no go from me
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:19:38
It's way better to advertise bitcoin to new people. If you sent it to someone who already has a address, chances are it'll not introduce anyone new. I had a QR code at the end of my bitcoin animation, but I still got most tips through changetip.
@_date: 2014-01-31 10:58:42
1.Back up your coins.
2.Don't panic sell.

Our number one friend, Mark, retweeted this a while back.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:41:47
Yup! 
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:22:39
There's no way they'd make it. Sathoshi is too niche

that's actually ten dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:35:58

Doesn't look like the have a credit option to store in your account, i guess they don't want to hold any funds for the moment... Yeah I agree, nobody wants to pay for video, but I thought the same with Patreon.com and that seems to be funding creators thousands per video, so who knows. I guess if you have a large dedicated fanbase already you could get some support that way by releasing early access or exclusive content on this site, but it's gonna be tough for small creators for sure!
@_date: 2014-11-09 10:49:37
I was collaborating with some developer on here to make a bitcoin spin off of the cookie clicker game and breaking bad clicker. I was really excited about it and made some art assets but then he disappeared :(

I wonder did any one record when it fell over and all the pieces came flying off :P
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:33:40
They'll probably post an update saying that an update to their update will be updated soon. :P

 does this better and is client side encrypted.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:40:30
Yeah that could work easily, they'd just need to enable embedding and it could open it to anybody's site/blog/even facebook
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:20:14
It's only 22 states at the moment
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:38:50
Yeah Youtube experimented with a tipjar, and still are however it's usually reserved for charities and I'd be very surprised if they used bitcoin. Knowing Youtube they'll implement some useless feature or redesign rather than adding something cool like a tipjar
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:43:22
So transaction fees are kept low or almost zero right now because of miners. What happens when all the coins are mined? Will transaction fees rise?

Wow, I was not expecting his accent to be that strong.

No they don't pay out and you only get $4 of each $5 job.

the collective gasp when it happened was hilarious 
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:42:26
yeah i agree, people want stuff for free. Maybe some sort of virtual tip jar would be better instead of pay per view.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:33:04
The transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:45:33
Just saw your Al Jazeera interview! Keep up the awesome work.

Is there a fee to withdraw it to bank? and how long does it take?

Pretty sure it's just Ireland, mostly Dublin restaurants right now. I'd say it will grow larger in the coming months anyway, it's a former Just-eat executive who set it up.

I guess it would encourage people to actually spend time creating good content, rather than the plethora of shit we see on youtube right now with unboxing videos and pewdiepie type channels where they literally film something in twenty minutes and upload it.

@_date: 2015-09-08 09:54:23
You've done a great good for this community! My first day here you tipped me 0.1($100 at the time) and I flipped my shit. I've been here every day ever since. Hope you stick around, as you're one of the few remaining good things about this whole sub.
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:52:03
The price of bitcoin fluctuates a lot, so I'd probably have to update it every day on my site, unless there's some sort of live price widget I could add

Thanks :D
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:29:38
Haha! Most of it is from doing animation commissions work and it was long gone before it was the highs of today! That said when I originally released this I got around $100 in bitcoin tips through changetip which I appreciated. Revenue from the video ads is around $40. Shame changetip is gone, it was great for supporting creators online

You got me started with bitcoin on my very first day here, with a tip of .0.1 ($100 at the time) I've been hooked since! Even spent many hours creating a cartoon about bitcoin which has gotten me countless animation jobs paid in bitcoin.
Thanks for getting me started. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:55:29
Using a tablet.
Photoshop brush stokes for the colour backgrounds to give a painted look, and drawing over photo references (most of them anyway, especially when it features a specific person ) and painting them in white  underneath to give a hand drawn look.  If anyone wants a similar one, I can do it! I accept bitcoin for art and animations.  
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:51:08
I added a QR code to one of my animations, but I think the majority of tips came in via comments using Changetip! 
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:19:41


That's wrong, it's still at least $1000, often more.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:44:05
If it's that easy...I would have thought sidebar ads would be more enforced, what if someone advertised a fake blockchain phishing advert or something?

Not MtGox anyway after last night.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:31:45
Well currently i'm not sure what i'm looking at on your site. Is that chart for todays fluctuations or 3days? That's why i'd like a timeframe option so i could view how the charts are performing and make estimations on it's future.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:57
I only own 0.1 in bitcoin, so I'm not going to sell it. But when it goes down low enough I'm going to buy as many as i can afford!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:51:33
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:12:53
woah over $40,000 in bitcoin was once in that account, how come you didn't hold on to any?

Woah. No words. Thank you so much!!!! My bitcoin adventure can begin! :D
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:36:21
What about mining altcoins? Surely it's easier to do that than bitcoin at the moment.

@_date: 2013-12-14 21:02:32
Seriously? Wow. It's depressing how easy people are duped into this stuff, we're at the forefront of a new digital currency you'd think we'd be a bit more internet savvy
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:48:39
Yeah, but can it get much higher than $1000 per BTC? I've seen some estimates that it could reach $10,000 but I'm not so sure.

[Here's my entry! :) ](
What do you think?
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:27:39
Yeah but isn't the ultimate goal to have bitcoin accepted everywhere? It would be nice to go and buy groceries with bitcoin but I don't think I'd enjoy doing risky transactions on a silkroad type site if it was banned.

I only have about $100 invested, it's nearly halved from yesterday! It's disheartening to watch, but i'm gonna stick it out for the long run and hope for the best! :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:26:29
If i had $800 I would :P

I wish they'd make the big exchanges worldwide. I'm in ireland and couldn't buy bitcoin easily, only over priced bitcoin from local sellers.

why won't he reveal his identity?

I've never used an online poker site before but I'd like to. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:27:07
Ah okay I'll rescan! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:41:49
Thanks very much! :)

I'm from Ireland, the bitcoin community here is tiny, almost non-existent. 
If you pick me, I'll go to and promote it and give away $50 of it in tips.
The rest would remain in my reddit wallet for future tips all around reddit to promote the world of bitcoin! :D

Try faucet sites like [freebitco.in](
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:41:15
holy shit! Did you just tip 0.2 BTC?!! So generous! I just started with bitcoin and hope i can make such tips in the future :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:52:26
the nasdaq has a fibre optic cable stretching across the entire atlantic which shaves off 1 second of lag. It's not so easy
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:01:42
I hope he donates at least some of it to SeansOutpost.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:26:01
holy crap! That was awful nice of you! My grand total of bitcoin is $0.98 , I hope I get to a stage where I can get equally generous! I only started bitcoin yesterday :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:13:04
Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. :) 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:34:35
I think you have ascertained the title of badass motherfucker after that tip! :D
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:03:25
what site is that?
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:38:15
That was really nice of you Rob. I've only been in this community for 5 days and it's awesome!

Add a timeframe at least. And make the chart line more interface friendly. All the charts i've seen are very ugly and cluttered, too much information going on! Yours is okay, but a bit too simplistic, could use a redesign.
It would be cool if you could set an alarm on the site if bitcoin goes under or over a certain level so you could be notified when to buy and sell without constantly looking at the charts.
