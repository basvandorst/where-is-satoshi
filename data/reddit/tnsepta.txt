At worst, it's the equivalent of having them in a safe. You need a key (PIN or 24 word phrase) to open it that only you should know. It is also much more secure to being cut open or stolen than a safe

Just to put this into perspective, the bandwidth consumed by the blockchain currently is effectively 1MB/10 mins = 14kbit/s. This is literally slower than a dialup modem. It's likely there's a nontrivial proportion of people here that have never even used one of those because they're too young. 
The reason why nodes use so much bandwidth is not because of bandwidth consumed in propagating new blocks, but because of bandwidth used to "seed" the blockchain to nodes that don't already have a copy. This bandwidth used in such a scenario is proportional to the size of the current blockchain and not the block size.

Retarget time is likely going to be 31 Dec, and it's not that big of a jump (expected 7.3%) compared to the one that kicked off the recent mempool ATH (17.7%).

The value of Bitcoin as an investment depends solely on the degree people believe it has value. If it cannot be used as currency, its only value is as a speculative vehicle.

It basically talks about [Bitmex's article]( (without linking to it) that claims Bitmain incurred a $300M valuation loss by trading and holding BCH. 
The article then speculates, without any evidence whatsoever, that this will cause Bitmain to go bankrupt. The title literally says "It's rumoured that Bitmain will go bankrupt because of $300M investment losses."

So, what you're proposing here is for a system of DNS resolver equivalents to be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol addresses, much like real life DNS works on top of IP addresses. 
On your github page, your list of possible remedies for someone hacking the OpenCAP server includes the following (emphasis mine): 


If "being able to redirect payments made to your alias arbitrarily" isn't an inherent insecurity, I don't know what is. 
Furthermore, unless the operator of the server is paid by its users, they will always have a monetary incentive to exit scam and redirect all payments to themselves. Therefore, this system is not secure unless operated by you in a safe and secure manner, and I'd say that not many people know how to operate a DNS resolver in that way (myself included).

Precisely for that reason, I don't use my phone number as a 2FA for my bank. It is extremely difficult for phone companies to carry out sufficiently thorough security checks to prevent this attack model. 
The attack described is extremely old and has been known for a long time. Yet instead of holding his crypto securely following good practices, the guy decides to use a known insecure 2FA method and sue the phone company when he's hacked. 
To me, it's the equivalent of leaving your wallet on the pool chair and suing the hotel for not having enough security to catch the thief. Sure, they could have done something, but it's 90% your fault.

I'd not call that good news, they're covering 2500BTC of the losses, but it's likely that other investors will still get hit by this. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:40:01
Unless AT&amp;T and other providers mandate background checks on the level of getting a new driver's license/passport before allowing people to renew a lost SIM card, they can't actually prevent this attack. Phone numbers are easily transferrable by design, and therefore your phone number (as opposed to a key on your phone) is not a secure channel and should not be used as one. 
The fix is not to patch a system that wasn't ever designed to be secure, but to stop using that insecure system for high importance security.

Wasn't the whole point of covert Asicboost that it wasn't compatible with Segwit, but overt Asicboost was, which resulted in Jihan supporting the BCH fork/S2X fork over the current BTC fork? 
What's the economic incentive that Jihan has to not mine Segwit transactions? As Johoe mentioned, he seems to be losing profit doing this.

It was a 2 in 2 out transaction, so it doesn't even have the excuse of being large from having used many UTXOs. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:39:01
So I've tried to install the Lightning App on Android, and it seems to keep crashing when syncing block 583107 (which appears to be the most recently mined block). 
I've funded that wallet with a small amount before it finished syncing, and now I can't get the coins out of it, since the seed is not a valid BIP39 or Electrum seed and I am unable to import it to a different wallet. 
Is this wallet using a different derivation algorithm? I've got the seed words written down.
-edit- Apparently the seed is using a completely different derivation algorithm [as mentioned here]( and it has nothing to do with either BIP39 or Electrum. This is a pretty significant change and IMO should have been specified upon wallet creation.
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:14:46
So this is a standard-ish 2 input, 2 output transaction, with most of the value coming from a large 66k BTC UTXO which was returned as change. The actual amount being transacted was 500BTC. 
In any case, everyone should know that the absolute amount doesn't matter, only the size of the transaction. $5 per transaction is still pretty high for a small 2 in 2 out transaction. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:48:53
I'd like to restore the seed into a normal wallet, as it seems that the Lightning App's on chain wallet enforces a 6-block confirm fee, which means basically most of the amount I'm funding it with will be eaten up by the miner fee when the mempool is mostly empty. 
In either case I think this is likely a failed test and I don't foresee being able to reclaim any coins until they fix their wallet to display the actual on-chain wallet keys. I'm trying the LNbig wallet to open a channel, and I'll take you up on your offer when that happens.

I think I'm misunderstanding something. Why is this being touted as a "victory metric"? Since the costs of running a full node are so low (~$50/month for a decent quality dedicated server), it seems that a Sybil attack by parties who have millions to billions of dollars to lose would not be too difficult, especially considering these parties also own large amounts of BTC, which many server hosts accept as payment. For example, it would cost them $500K worth of BTC to sybil 10,000 nodes for a month, with worldwide distribution. With a contentious hard fork, what's stopping them from deploying 10,000 sybil S2X nodes and gain a majority over nodes?

I checked out the site (lnmainnet.gaben.win) on your other post, but was unable to find a source where I can download the raw data, and it seems that you need to [poke around in the network explorer]( in order to find the actual JSON raw data. 
Is there any easily-parseable CSV (or similar) format for the routing capacity data that I can look at? Also, would it be possible for you to link to the actual JSON file(s) used as well as the original data source? Thanks!

If you believe this, then you clearly don't understand why Bitcoin has value. Like fiat currency, Bitcoin has value because people believe it has value, and this has very little to do with whether it's deflationary or not. 
Anything that is out of print can be considered deflationary, and it can be considered currency if it's used to trade for goods or services. Zimbabwean dollars are deflationary currency. Not all deflationary currencies go up in value, and you can easily look at the hundreds of Bitcoin forks/clones that are also deflationary.

Of course an address is not a wallet, and nobody here is making that claim.
Addresses are generated from a public key and a private key pair (which is the true wallet). You don't require any software to send a transaction, you can do the signing with a pen and paper and submit the signed transactions directly onto the Bitcoin network, just as you can mine hashes the same way.
