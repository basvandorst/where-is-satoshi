Remember when we were celebrating 15k? Fuck the "coin" that shall not be named. Fuck Ver and his grimey friends. Bitcoin is in there like swimwear. I'm done stressing, I'm going to bed. Oh yeah and PS - FUCK coinbase - HODL TILL DEATH  PRIES THESE GODDAMN CHUCKY CHEESE TOKENS OUT OF MY COLD DEAD HANDS.

And in the accounts tab they put bch at the top, haha like they don't even give a fuck about any kind of plausible deniability. They don't even have the bch logo uploaded yet, fucking clownshoes

Yep and they won't say shit either. I knew they were grimey but this is next level shit -  - look for the rectangle candle on gdax that shoots bch up to 9 thou, it could be seen on coinbase for a bit too but they've tucked it away nicely. Dont tell me that was a mistake or something, that was either someone/s blowing their wad early or gdax/coinbase skewing the market. Definitely intentional. What a scam in every way!!!

Download coinomi from the playstore and sweep any and all private keys that had btc on it at the time. Its good you moved the coin from that wallet, it makes the retrieving process safer. Step 2 is to sell all of your bitscam for less than the current price, that way you start the downward trajectory that kills bch and your named king of the bitcoins

Btc accounts for most of the crypto ownership, when btc gets hit almost all of the others feel it too. He made an analogy, he didn't insult your mother.

 I like that one but its kinda weird in what coins it lists

Probs a dead cat. Makes me sad in both meanings of the phrase.

This song just popped into my head for the first time since I was like 14. Never felt more relevant than right now ����
