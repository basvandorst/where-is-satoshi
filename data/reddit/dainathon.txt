Nope, bitcoin was first so it will always be the best! /s
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:15:05
its a currency tho
it needs to be able to handle attacks
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:44:28
Id say at the moment the block size is more important as transactions are expensive as fuck
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:14:30

one day
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:53:04
Yeah its sad
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:04:44
I call it BCH
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:42:14
Its not even down much though
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:07:02
allows content of all bitcoin chains, including forks
However, since BCH posts are removed here as well as posts talking about blocksize increases, the people that want to talk about those things end up there
Which makes that sub very BCH oriented
If all r/bitcoin users and r/btc users used r/btc, it would be good imo
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:36:12
What about monero and anonymity
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:53:45
On r/btc most people like BCH because BCH supporters are pushed away from here, not because of the sub itself
This place pushes an agenda way more as it actually removes posts all the time that talk about BCH, Block size changes, and other things. Yet is totally 100% okay with posts about those topics when they're saying how bad they are
r/btc is mostly about BCH but at least its because of the voting system on reddit and not the mods removing BTC related posts
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:59:48
Hope this is supposed to be an "/s"
The idea that having even 8MB blocks would cause centralization is ridiculous

@_date: 2018-01-06 22:00:14
Who cares?
Why do we need to shit on BCH
I hate seeing these kinds of posts on the front page because anything that regards bch that isnt shitting on it is "talking about an altcoin, against the rules"
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:15:36
Because thats how reddit works?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:47:58

@_date: 2018-01-07 03:29:41
There can be and are many
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:28:08
and BCH on chain transactions are like 1000x cheaper than BTC except its here and doesnt need to be loaded
(not shitting on LN, more at the communities refusal to upgrade the block size limit despite 1mb not being enough for the whole world even with LN)
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:38:59
I don't believe so but LN is such a big deal now its not like we will just drop it if we upgraded the block size
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:26:58
Its 10% still
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:18:11
Tell me why a blocksize increase is a bad idea despite 1MB not being enough for the world to use BTC with LN
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:14:39
We should always be developing additional infrastructure
The fact that BTC is the way it is rn and how far away LN is, warrants a blocksize increase
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:32:52
what is the point of this post
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:28:50
because lots of people dont like off chain solutions
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:34:12
People need to realize that BTC, while it has a solid ground and the branding of "The first coin" has the ability to be overthrown as  coin, everyone please stop claiming BTC is basically the god of money and cant be beaten

Holy shit
Okay no r/btc is a sub where anyone can post their opinions and the reason r/btc is so BCH oriented is because anyone who tries to talk positively about BCH here gets banned or their post gets removed so they go there
BCH posts get upvoted way more there but people dont get posts removed for saying their opinions
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:14:40
Yeah but ~~memory~~ storage isnt that expensive these days and it would take like 10 years for 8mb blocks to fill a 4tb HDD which by then ~~memory~~ storage would be much cheaper than now
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:51:05
I think people see LN as a miracle cure
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:14:38
bitcoin shouldn't be looked at as "gold"
it should be a currency
that's the whole point
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:56:59
Yes but at the same time, more transactions will be clearing so more people can use a congested 2/4/8mb network than a congested 1mb one
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:36:40


That is 100% mocking, you're basically saying "you are making a stupid decision but im not going to comment on it despite just commenting on it"
"Bitcoin isnt guaranteed to go up, it might plummet one day"

Its not against the rules to talk about the same thing again, and even so, at least say thats why its being removed
They claim im promoting a hard fork when thats not at all what the post was

Fuck off, let him cash out on an investment without being mocked for it
Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to go up, it might plummet one day.
Sometimes people are actually okay with 5000% profit
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:34:02
this is more about them seeing a question about why bigger blocks are a problem and saying "you're promoting a hard fork, removed."
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:42:06
I see posts shitting on BCH all the time here but that's seemingly acceptable 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:32
i just call it BCH because no one gives a shit then
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:36
Im saying that bitcoin shouldnt be just "a store of value"
We want it to be currency
Thats the whole point
People who dismiss the problems of the network with "its a store of value" are missing the point entirely 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:45:35
Storage isnt that expensive anymore and gets cheaper as time goes on, and what sounds better
• miners spend extra on their rigs
• users spend like $30+ per transaction 
Im pretty sure the network can handle a small blocksize increase and be fine
Ex. Ltc has 4x the amount added to the blockchain every 10 minutes yet it is extremely decentralized 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:43:36
How did they fail, bch forked off and while its not as valuable as btc it still has some major backing
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:14:08

Because people should see that a post this innocent is being removed as "promoting a hard fork"
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:18:57


@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:32
I do think that huge blocks isnt really viable, however why is something like BCH or LTC's approach okay for now
As in why not have 8mb blocks or more blocks per 10 minutes for now if it would help make the network better
I understand that its just delaying the issue but its not as if people couldnt handle a size increase like that
The only real downside i can see is maybe loweing pressure for LN to be added

it isnt
its just that it shouldnt replace BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:17:39
I understand where you're coming from (and actually your response does provide some clairity to me) however I would say the biggest reason BTC is the largest crypto is that it was the first and most people have heard of it. Ask a stranger if they know what Bitcoin is and they'll probably say "i've heard of it"
Ask a strainger if they know what ethereum is and they'll probably say "no"
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:16:50
Yeah contrary to popular belief, some normal people believe in BCH
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:22:30
I personally call it BCH to avoid any conflict at all, but no its called Bitcoin Cash because its a fork of Bitcoin. Not everyone wanted it but enough did that it became a thing. Bitcoin Cash has the rights to the name, just not the rights to say "Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin" or any of that shit because thats just stupid
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:01:27

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:25:49
The sarcasm and insulting really helps
But yes I understand why the network is clogged, my biggest concern is that the network can get this clogged in the first place, intentionally or not.
I just think that people are too quick to assume that someone being concerned for the BTC network is a shill.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:12:54
They think they can block me!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:33:18

Because thats basically saying "gg alt coins you win"
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:09:47
Again this is just my opinion, im not saying we should block these transactions. I mean that the network should be able to handle it.
And small being roughly less than a dollar while massive being idk 10$ or something
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:56:29
I didn't mean that, I'm saying that many people are being dismissed as shills when they express a concern toward the BTC network when they actually want the best for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:54:21
How was it a stupid post? I just said that if BTC gets slower and more expensive overtime that it could be its down downfall. It also clearly shows that no, not everyone is free to speak their mind here.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:49:15
Thank you.
"BTC Transactions are way too expensive and slow. It shouldnt be this easy to spam the network, also every time I someone says something negative about BTC, they're called shills"
"Wow you're dumb, are you a shill?"
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:13:57
I'm not denying that there are shills trying to manipulate, I'm just saying that people are too quick to assume the worst in others here.
The reason I'm saying this now is because due to the massive clogging of btc's mempool in the past few days, I posted something here basically saying that its too easy for something like this to happen to BTC, but then my post was removed without me knowing (until i saw it wasn't under the "new" tab anymore) and that was upsetting and also somewhat concerning
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:43:26
If that was the truth, I'd be somewhat happy because I have more BCH than BTC rn (daytrading (dont daytrade, you lose))

You dont need the passphrase to access your wallet, only to set it up initially 
So if you lost the passphrase, the danger would be:
• Losing/Breaking your current wallet with the coins still on it
• Someone using the seed to gain access to the coins
The passphrase is only there as backup, if you have backup then an accident can be fixed, such as losing your wallet then using the passphrase to get it back. You dont need it to use an already set up wallet
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:05:02

[see this comment](
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:59:04
Yeah its biased, but most opinions are allowed
Which was my point
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:10:50
Like any wallet you need to secure your 12/24 word passphrase
The difference is that a hardware wallet cannot be hacked and the information is secure on the wallet as the private info never leaves the device
If you were to break or lose a hardware wallet, you could recover the wallet on a different one using the passphrase
For example, to get to my BCH after the fork, I used my keep key's passphrase on coinami and managed it there. I then set up a new wallet on my keep key with a new phrase and transfered the btc back to it
I can be confident knowing my KeepKey has all my info and the only way to lose my coins would be for someone to find my physical paper with the backup passphrase on it, or take my keepkey and happen to know my 4 digit pin on it. (iirc if you get it wrong 3 times, it resets the wallet)
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:05:04
Assuming thats $100
BTC would be $40,000,000
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:55:10
If the pin is entered wrong 3 times and its all reset, you can restore your wallet by using the 12 word phrase
So to lose your money unintentionally you would need to
A) Lose/Break your wallet and simultaneously lose the 12 word backup
B) Have someone use your wallet and correctly guess the pin
C) have someone steal your 12 word passphrase and remove all the coins before you could move them to a new wallet
If you lose your passphrase you could send the coins to a new wallet and set the hardware wallet up again, returning the coins
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:17:59
Im saying they're typically obnoxious about it

Honestly the only time i see them be kind to someone who shares the views of r/bitcoin is when they premise what they say with something negative about this place

Honestly both subs have their problems, but r/btc is way too "in your face" about how they hate this sub
Which is the biggest turn off for me

I asked what does Bitcoin offer than Litecoin doesn't

Idk why the threshold is so high
75% seems way more reasonable than almost everu miner

SegWit on LTC hasn't activated yet, its just been confirmed
How can they say "great results"
It hasn't even started, like yes the price is up but we havent seen segwit in action on ltc yet

You deserve the ban, and every time someone says something supportive of the ban you respond like a child
All you're doing is helping polarize the two subs

Not a chance
