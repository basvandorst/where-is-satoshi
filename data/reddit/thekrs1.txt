OH, so you want your private key tattoo'd on your ass?

I only recommended because it's been perfect for me ( iOS). If you do your due diligence and find a better alternative that works better for you, all the power to you.

Bet they wish they could un-kill themselves with how it rebounded.

Serious Question: With the transparency of the blockchain, how difficult would it be to actually spend the stolen coins without being detected?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:47:53
You simply crack that block in the chain and inject it going to a wallet you control....
Oh and then you have to hack every single subsequent block until your forged block catches up with the current chain and you also are accepted as having the longest block chain.

No need to apologize. Figure out what platform you want to use for your secure wallet. If you want it on your desktop, I recommend  You can find BTC wallets for iOS or Android (like [bread]( 
The most secure method would be to buy a hardware wallet like the [Trezor]( When that is all set up (be sure to securely record your seed words. If anything happens to your device or computer this is your ONLY way to regain access to your funds). 
Then you simply transfer the coins from your CoinBase wallet to your new private one. [Coinbase explains here](
Note, confirm the address that is entered when you withdraw from coinbase. There is malware out there that will alter a copy/paste bitcoin address. That could cause you to send money to someonelse's wallet (to be lost forever).
In my opinion you should absolutely do this. If CoinBase is ever compromised you could lose everything.
Treat your private wallet very securely.
Edit: [looks like I was talking to someone else when I referred to other wallets.](

I'm in the same boat. If I can pay for the S9 in 6 weeks of Mining, why wouldn't I be buying one?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:47:11
Unless you're day trading, I highly recommend keeping your BTC on your own wallet with your own private keys. If something were to happen to Bitfinex you could lose everything. Always hold your own keys.

Yeah sorry, I mean. I was being facetious to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:38:35
1. There would be no incentive for this platform to do this. What are they going to do, lend out your BTC at an interest rate high enough to profit and pay you?
2. How would they lend BTC in a secure way to someone that will repay the loan?
3. You'd be giving up ownership of the BTC. Trying to get a few extra % could cost you everything.

Fair enough. Thanks. I learned something today.

If you are starting that small and are going to want to check your balance frequently, I'd recommend going with Bread on your mobile device.

[I was using the NiceHash mining calculator for that.]( That could be out the window now.

1. Depending on where you are at different banking rules apply. For me, a Canadian, the deposit insurance afforded by the banks is capped at $100,000.00. So, if the bank folded or something crazy happened then any amount over $100k would not be covered.
2. It isn't proper to compare NiceHash to a bank. They shouldn't have been a method to store any funds. They were a mining pool. This would be like being employed as a miner in a gold mine. This employer offered you different options for getting paid. If you wanted to get paid more frequently, you would have more fees deducted from your paycheck. This theft would be like the mine shutting down while the workers slept. You arrived for work in the morning to find that there is a lock on the gate and everyone left. Your uncollected paychecks are now gone. You would have an ability to sue the organization, but if the cash was stolen you'd waste less money and effort trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

I'm more upset about what this could do to public opinion. That and the trust of the product. If they fixed this issue, they did have a good service.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:56:46


I don't think we have seen any case of Bitcoin wallets being "hacked". The people storing their funds in places other than their own private wallets have had issues. That's the part we need to ensure stays clear. If you leave your funds in someonelse's wallet they will always be at risk.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:00:11
I'm not aware of a shred wallet on PC and phone. I'd recommend a phone wallet like Bread ( for smaller balances and something like a [paperwallet]( for long hodls's. If you are kind of inbetween that then a Ledger isn't a bad thing to have.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:42:23
I would think that, if they were properly motivated, an international investigation would be able to track down any substantial amount of the funds spent? I mean, those that were buying stuff on the silk road were taken down.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:28:13
You were late!
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:56
Yeah, that's what I do. One nice feature if you having any mobile funds and you feel like timing the market you can set up a wallet with quadriga that automatically sells BTC received and converts it to USD or CAD.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:12:49
Canuck here that has had 0 issues using Quadriga.

They said they will. They did support bitcoin cash after it launched. It will take some time though. It won't be over night.

I have just learned this as well. I am already overdrawn on fucks.

What's the point of transactions like [this]( Looks to me like a new wallet is transferred 170 Bitcoins only to immediately transfer to another wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:24:54

@_date: 2017-10-23 15:33:51
I'd set up a new wallet where you own the keys. Something like [Bread for iOS](  or [Exodus for desktop](

     //I don't know how to code, but I'm doing my part to help.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:14:05
There is a new (actually 2) rival protocol that is being "forked" or based on the existing Bitcoin protocol. Since it will use the existing Bitcoin Ledger, any Bitcoins that you have when the fork occurs will equal the same number of coins on the new currency. Essentially it will double your number of coins (but the new currency and/or bitcoin may not be worth what they were before the fork).
If you buy before the fork you are guaranteed these "free" other coins. However, since I think the price has increased for people trying to get on this chain you might be paying more for bitcoin than it will be worth right after the fork. If you hold off, you could get a better deal. That much is all a guess.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:28:30
They aren't scheduled for dates, but for specific block  That being said we can make a pretty good guess at when they will happen. BGold should be on October 25 (2 days). The SegWit2x one should be mid November.

As a n00b, how does a hardfork work for me? Do I suddenly get a mirrored wallet address on the two different chains?
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:55:25
I haven't yet either. My understanding is that until you have a wallet that is capable of claiming the new coin then spending any bitcoin would also send the other set. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:21:10

I just wish BTC would drop so I can by more.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:12:50
Yes. My understanding is coin base keeps your private keys. So, you might not be able to claim the forked new coins.
