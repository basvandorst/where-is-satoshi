Sorry to disappoint but I am wealthy.  Lacking several zeroes compared to these men but still comfortable...

Dude needs to hire Roger the Shrubber for those brows.

Theranos had some issues but they weren't trying to eradicate half the universe.  Have you no moral compass?!

If the TBTF banks die alphabetically I'm blaming Skynet.

The infrastructure is being built as we speak (a 10-20 year process to maturity...)  Example:  
The middleman is not disappearing.  It will likely be a different middleman as existing entities are always slow to change. Difference?  The new middleman is simply going to operate at a much lower cost and pass the savings along to the customer.  I.e. Google search vs. Yellow Pages.

What I find interesting (having been a student of finance for 30+ years) is the massive lack of awareness / responsibility between Baby Boomers retirement expectations and reality (worldwide debt bubble much of which is pension / social security related).  When this house of cards collapses (and it will collapse one day) the older generations will expect the younger generation to bail them out. And the younger generation will shrug their collective shoulders and say "Not my currency. Not my debts.  Not my problems."

In the last year I have begun using the "Walmart Pay" app (simply links the app to your credit / debit cards) and you pay by shooting a QR code rather than inserting / swiping your card. Suddenly I have a DIGITAL record of my purchases rather than a 3' long piece of paper to throw away.  It's convenient, faster, better.  But I can tell by the reaction of the "Door Attendants" who glance at your receipt on the way out the door this isn't common.  (I've never seen another person pull out their phone when asked for a receipt.)  How long will it be before mobile/QR payments are the norm?  I'd guess much longer than 5 years but I've been wrong before. (Once. Circa 1995.)

Disagree.  The world has never had a currency which could be trusted.  Currencies are built upon confidence &amp; trust (and eventually the lack thereof...)   No one knows how a fiat-less world would operate but it would undoubtedly remove power from the banks / governments and place it back in the hands of the people. Freedom always triumphs. Any short-term impact is worth enduring.

Draper takeaway quote:  "monetize a movement..."   The world will become a global society defined by movements rather than fragmented societies defined by geographic borders.   (This is not to suggest the yellow brick road to a cryptopian (crypto utopian) future will be without potholes. Such a transition would be painful for many / most people.)

Solution:  The Tell-Tale Coin strategy.  Everyone quietly mutters "bcash" as they pass Roger on the street. 5 years from now he doesn't know if everyone is out to get him or if he's hearing things. Regardless he goes mental and falls apart.  Ain't enough money in the world to fix crazy.

It's going to take another Industrial Revolution to trim that browrest.
