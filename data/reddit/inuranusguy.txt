You don't have to literally post "BITCOIN!!!", to be a relevant post for this subreddit. Just relax.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:02:06
Post history shows you are a professional anti-bitcoin shill
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:48:59
Fuck off troll, go do something constructive with your life.
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:09:48
You are a loser banker paid troll. (Check the posting history of this moron)
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:23:24
I'm already there!
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:45:06
Can I be of service?

This is the equivalent to a peaceful protest by thousands  of people, spoiled by infiltrated cops behaving violent breaking and destroying property.

You dont tell me what to do I tell you!
**&gt; Always use the word "private" at the very end when tipping outside r/bitcoin, so it won't clutter/spam the comments section and we won't be banned.**
Now, go and spread the wealth my son! $1 private

Yes, the open source is posted by OP. This extension is really great, please rate and review.
@_date: 2014-10-31 03:14:41
Do you mean to say that we need to see literally the word "bitcoin" to post something in this subreddit?. This is bitcoin related, since things like that will drive more people towards this decentralized technology. Bitcoin not affected. Any way, checked your post history and you are a professional anti-bitcoin troll.
@_date: 2014-10-17 23:49:27
I like the idea

@_date: 2014-10-17 23:51:11
He was so famous I think he is trolling now under some of the new troll accounts.
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:29:35
^This is one of the paid trolls, he has many new accounts, copy-pasting the same comments all over.
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:57:27
Like this? Check this poster for example, total psychopath:
