Putting poison on someone else’s property is not harmless dingus

If someone put rat poison in the shape of a skull on your door it would be perceived as a threat.

Hundreds of years of economic philosophy haven’t found an answer. So I’d say it’s tougher than it looks.

Business insider aka random interns shit posting

Yeah this is pretty embarrassing. Inflation not the fed reduced the purchasing power. Thing is inflation is needed for the economy to expand.

Beginning your sentence with “omg” immediately identifies you as a retard.

Never speculatively invest with money you cannot afford to lose. At this point you might as well hold. Don’t turn on paper losses into realized losses. Depends on how bad you need the item though.

Lol this is funny. The military industrial complex is a completely separate issue. You sound like you are about 14 and don’t know your ass from your elbow.

It’s a house of cards for sure yet monetary and fiscal policy manipulation is what helps stabilize the economy and are the few tools governments have to pull out a recession or slow down inflation. These questions have plagued economists for years. This guy ranting about it doesn’t actually provide a solution does it? 
So how does this relate to bit coin? How can bit coin solve this? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:55:20
Doesn’t make a bit of sense like most of the drivel that is posted on this sub. Bitcoin is not a bank.

But do you know why they are “creating fake money”? What is you background in economics?
