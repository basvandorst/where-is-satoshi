Also one of Donald Trump's top lenders...
Go figure. I am sure it's all a big coincidence with the money laundering and stuff...

Because the vast majority of democracies are actually just *fascism light*, due to the influence of corporate money. Imagine the Nazis without the Blitz and without racism. But instead, more subtle racism/classism and secret wars.
And corporations work very hard to influence and control the flow of money. The pretense of a "free market" is all just marketing designed to obfuscate the fact that exactly 0 of the market is actually free.
Any significant money maker is controlled, acquired, or destroyed.
Capitalism is actually a Trojan horse virus that has mutated into ever worse strains since its adoption. Currently, it is working to find a vector to destroy crypto, which manifests as the thrash in the markets we are seeing.
The winner take all question mark currently in play is whether capitalism will succeed in infecting crypto. Anyone HODLing believes it will fail.
What I don't see talked about often is what happens if capitalism fails to infect and destroy crypto... And I believe the answer to that is a simple "if you can't beat'em, join'em" strategy that will see the pillars of capitalism become parasite to crypto markets.
The result of that is anyone's guess, once the global economy moves onto the blockchain.

Has anyone else experienced issues getting RaspiBlitz to boot?
I have a pi3B that boots other images just fine but when I boot raspiblitz it always locks up somewhere along the line. No errors are seen, just stops...
I have re-downloaded the image on two different machines, one Win10 one OSX, burned the image to SD on both machines, tried 3 different SD cards (2 verified working with other images)...
I am running out of ideas here...
Also, it doesn't even lockup at the same spot each time. Seems to be very random. Sometimes early on in boot and sometimes toward the end...

One it hits the wallet... It's just so good.
C'mon, everyone! Let's streak the exchange! Wooooooo!

Upvoting because funny, not because wholly accurate.

I love/hate it. Such a great movie that makes me so angry, as someone who lived in Las Vegas at the time and narrowly avoided getting fucked.
Had plenty of friends get fucked though... Sucked.

I kinda liked the idea of being able to send my 6 year old to buy heroine and hand grenades at the grocery store, personally.

Just make sure if you are planning on sitting on it long term, get yourself a hard wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano, etc.) and put it in a firesafe/safe deposit box. Then forget about it until you are either rich or it doesn't matter anymore.

Was a factor but not the overall cause.
Lots of moving parts in the BTC world. It's not a simple as a single factor causing anything.
And not all of the factors are even knowable. Given the inherent secretive nature of BTC, there's a lot going on that we don't see that is having an impact. And some people very likely decided to use the fork as cover.
