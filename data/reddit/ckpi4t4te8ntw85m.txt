Sent my Bitcoins to a .onion site which happened to be fake URL. It came from a (what i thought) reliable source. But a simple Google search just to check the URL multiple places, would have shown it was a fake...

I have considered running an Electrum server on top of my node too, (also because it is my favorite wallet currently hehe :) ). Was it easy enough setting up? :D

Like the little detail in the lower right corner, "Cliks "buy" again". Made me giggle a little... xD

For now i have no coins on exchanges, (i always transfer them to a local wallet immediately after i have brought them). I will also see the august storm out before i buy any new coins, so i do not risk losing any money, (or get on the wrong chain).

Thanks. :D Fixed. ;)

Yeah okay, i will probably try to set it up in one of the following days. :)

Miners will need a mempool to store transactions until they can be confirmed... So if the big majority of nodes will upgrade, it will be much more profitable for miners to mine on the UASF chain in case of a split (expect for AsicBoost miners maybe).

A real fucking bummer! One of the top Google result deepweb URL indexes, i used it to found a link for the Helix Light Bitcoin mixer. Found the page on the top link Google search for the .onion link. I have used the Helix mixer with great succes previously, that time i also just found found the URL with Google. But according to r/grams it is a real big problem with fake URL's... :'(
Edit (Forgot the amount): It was not end of the world, but it was still a 100 bucks... I just think for those poor souls who lost 1.000+ USD!
Edit 2: Typo.
Edit 3: Explanation.

I think my skills using linux is a bit weak, but i tried Googling around and visiting the UASF site for help. I ended up compiling from source, but it took a lot more time than i had hoped for. The UASF site wasn't as useful as i had hoped either. :/
