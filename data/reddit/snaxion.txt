Good chance it was an inside job, but dunno. My guess is Bitfinex has clammed up because they are either negotiating with the hacker or they are getting tied up in court at the moment. I don't envy Phil Potter et al at the moment. 
Maybe hardfork and have BTC and BTX.

Dunno. All I know for a fact is it is strange. I've been with them for a long time and this is the first time this has happened. Maybe just coincidence, but thought I'd share...

Talking with the security guys at my MF, they said Mint in the  reason for these 2FA SMS messages. Deleting Mint ruled them out as the source of the 2FA SMS messages.  Any no, I don't share passwords across accounts.
Only saving grace is my MF is glacially slow to move on transaction requests, so I should be able to catch any fraud before it happens.

If not real money, they sure do a good job of making act like it when I pay for things with my debit card.  I would posit that the numbers on the bank's balance sheet are indeed real money or at least equivalent to real money. Maybe "bank IOU tokens" would be a better  term. In any case, unless I want to hold cotton or metal, all I get are bank promises. That is why bitcoin is a game-changer. I get to keep the control of my money AND it is in the form of ones and zeros, not bulk commodity items. 
Edit: I am using this definition of money:

Could it be said that all money is physical? My money right now resides on several HDD servers which are physical ones and zeros which MegaBank owns. Technically, all money is physical at the quantum level, methinks. Either way, I would prefer to have custody and control of my money. If I want to lend it out, the MegaBank should pay for that privilege. Right now they have a monopoly on the custodial rights to all money that isn't cotton or metal (think ones and zeros). I want custodial rights and feel entitled to it.

Money is simply an abstraction that humans created to keep track of goodwill. Bitcoin allows the easy transmission of goodwill over the internet and is hard to censor. The black market is one of several use-cases. I am indifferent if Bitcoin is the dominant currency. Seems like a more anonymous altcoin makes more sense.

I agree with that, actually. The thing is, it never reached my target. So now I wait. You have to have an exit plan. I have a 10 year horizon. Calling tops and bottoms is a recipe for disaster (for me, anyway). Do I think BTC will reach my target in the next 10 years? I 100% think it will. I learned long ago, never be a motivated seller. Never sell out of fear. Sell into strength. All of this BTC could go to 0 and things will be fine for me.

There is a philosophy of investing that says you should first get your money out and let your winners ride. A lot of people have gotten rich using this maxim. I personally am partaking in this because the the upside potential is so great. All I can lose is the same amount I spend on a vacation, hence it truly is disposable income.
It all boils down to the risk and reward balance. I put a tiny amount at risk and the reward is large enough to continue to put it at risk.

It is an unrealized loss. In fact the IRS wouldn't consider it a loss at all until you convert to fiat.
Sell out of fear and the market has a tendency to turn around immediately. You aren't supposed to sell low and buy high. Vice versa tends to work out better. 
The best attitude is to face that you lost the money the moment you invested in BTC. At that point, it is all upside. Otherwise emotions will get you and you will make a bad trade. This has worked for me since BTC was $5. Seen this all before.

Nobody had a single bitcoin stolen from them by Mt. Gox. Once the private keys were transferred to Mt. Gox, they owned Gox IOUs. And they aren't making good on their IOUs.

Hogwash. Putting your money in a "savings account" earns almost no interest and is equivalent to putting it under a mattress. My grandparents did this during the great depression and it got them through. They certainly didn't characterize their actions as "hoarding." They were "saving" their capital so they could spend it later.

@_date: 2014-04-11 14:02:06
This. I haven't been around as long as you but feel the same way.
The current price of a volatile asset is a blessing and a curse. It will go way down and way up. The current price is only transitory. Selling simply because the market is temporarily placing a lower price on an asset is so not a reason to sell. If you stop believing in the tech, that would be a much sounder reason. The protocol is performing perfectly.

First mover advantage. Too many folks have a vested interest in bitcoin, making virtual currencies more "sticky" than say a website.

Krugman's fears are overwrought. He asserts a false premise which is Americans keep their savings (cash) in the form of USD.  Actually most of us invest these savings by purchasing equity and debt securities which provide more or less a guaranteed return over the correct timescale. Americans are already  incentivized to NOT spend their cash on depreciating assets. Why on earth would I buy a consumable today when I could just wait and have more money to buy an even more expensive consumable. Anyway, my 2 cents...

Some perspective:
I've been here before this subreddit had 1000 members. That was not that long ago. All this bitcoin and dogecoin stuff is all pretty recent. Funny to hear people ALREADY talking about how jaded on community is vs. another. The fact is it is all still pretty dang new.

Joe is worth over 25 million, so he must be smart in some sense. He is slightly extroverted and plays the role of the jocky big-brother to the masses. People trust him. I wouldn't be surprised if he did NOT jump on the BTC party-wagon on his show -- however entertaining it probably will be.

Best advice:
Once you put your money into bitcoin, consider it lost. The network could fail at any moment rendering your investment equal to $0. BUT it might also 40x in the next couple of years. Make sure you are OK with this risk/reward ratio.

There are so many people sitting on the sidelines with cash locked and loaded to buy a lower prices (like me), not sure this would work.
Also, if these pools (like GHash.IO) that have millions in investment in mining hardware, the last thing they would want to do is to undermine the trust in bitcoin. Maybe that trust would never come back and their mining operation becomes unprofitable.

If that were true, all federally licensed handgun (and ammunition) dealers would be in jail. Handguns and bullets are designed to directly kill other humans. There is even a specially designed special hollow point bullet to tear as much internal flesh in a human as possible. 
So if purchaser of a handgun + ammunition murdered another human, this would also fall under a "reasonably foreseeable act," and in your scenario, the seller would be in jeopardy. Even more so than heroin, as heroin is not designed to directly inflict harm to humans. Actually, heroin was designed to help humans.

Bitcoin is dead again. Dang. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:07:40
I agree. Satoshi's coins are bitcoins Achilles Heel IMHO. One entity could crash the market at any moment of their choosing. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:48:36
I agree long term. 
Short term, I think we could drop to $120.  It would be nice to scoop up some coins for the hotwallet at that price.

At the root, there has to be some sort of incentive to secure the network in a decentralized way. Outside of a currency, I don't see what else could do that. But maybe there is something?
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:59:48

Depending on the situation and terms of the loan, it might make sense. If the borrower has no assets and can easily BK to erase the debt, it could make sense. But other than that, I would say it is highly risky and not recommended.

I would recommend having the text address available as well as the QR code just in case you phone camera is broken (like mine was). 
Side note: When I asked the fellah at the counter if they took bitcoins, he though I said "Big Coins". He was like "sure we take Big Coins. One coin per pie." Glad the transaction worked out. The line of folks behind me were kind of enjoying the spectacle.

Only sell BTC after just purchasing BTC. Preferably at a vendor who takes BTC. The velocity of BTC is going to drive the price up for us hoarders.

Welcome to the blow-stamp family :)
I hope you plan on holding for the long term. I predict a sharp correction in the near term. But if you are patient, it will come back as the network effect of BTC continues its slow march forward. My calculations show we won't see these prices again till Oct 2014. But hey, maybe I'm wrong!

If they discover a flaw in the chip during board bring-up, they are hosed. It will be fixable, but if they have to re-spin (opposed to a metal fix), it will take months. I've seen it happen many times on other chips I've worked on. Then again, this could be the final spin of 6 in which case they are probably OK. Hopefully if they do find a flaw, they can fix it in software. We are good at that.

I asked one the same question and they said it was a cash flow issue. They needed to pay off their suppliers and didn't have time to wait for the units to generate coins.

Having spent lots of time on an SMT line in China, this looks legit. I'm guessing they hired a CM to build the stuff for them. They a dime a dozen in Shenzhen. So yeah I agree.

There is an old saying on Wall Street "if the cab driver is giving you stock tips, time to sell."  I am going to the airport tonight. I'll ask the cabbie if he knows about bitcoin. If he says "no", I'll breath a sigh of relief.

The big takeaway I got from the video is right near the end when they said they have to work out the communication protocol. Presumably between the board and the PC over USB. That tells me they are no where near ready to ship. Looks like good work is being done but get ready to wait.

You could be right. It is all about trade-offs. Without being part of the design cycle, it would be hard for me to judge. Maybe they stuffed a bunch of parts just for "show." Working technology is cool but marketing is actually more important from a business perspective.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:34:04
One thing that doesn't ring true for me about BFL is there is no talk about the software it takes to run their chip(s). Seems like they would need to budget some debug time once they get silicon. Although maybe it really similar to the FGPA code. Having brought up new boards w/ new silicon, I know it can be a B&amp;TCH.

If we had a correction today, I would expect a drop to 180-190$. I am just curve-fitting a simple S-curve that is usually seen with new technologies. The data is a little noisy so I might have to re-curve-fit if the price stays high like this for months.

Yeah, I am sitting right next to a reflow machine and the one in that picture looks like it just got off the truck. But maybe they were outsourcing that and are in the process of insourcing. Hard to say. I work for a semiconductor company and those pictures didn't quite instill confidence. But hey, once they  have vids of Mini-rigs hashing away - all the detractors will be silenced.

I think you have to treat your mining income as if you were running a gold mining operation for tax purposes. At least that is what one big mining company told me. Not looking forward to what that entails. I don't have a team of lawyers vetting this stuff.

I have a send transaction leaving coinbase that has not moved in days. They debitted my account but no bitcoins were sent. I emailed them and I get no response.
I also had a transaction dropped, but at least I didn't lose any $ over it.
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:53:19
Much of bitcoin doesn't rely on encryption more than it does how the transactions are digitally signed. My limited understanding is quantum computers are not going to help with that.

Hi, good to see you Sen. Moran.
All I would ask is you keep an open mind. This is a new technology in the spirit of the internet. How more American can it get when US companies are able to layer services upon bitcoin?

Far be it for me to defend BFL, but if the margins are there, I am all for putting lots of escape hatches on my boards. In other words, if the SW peeps have a hard time getting the on board USB working, nice to have another route (an external chip). My guess is this is what they are doing.

Sounds like you are pretty savvy at examining the blockchain. What tool(s) were you using to monitor the transactions?
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:30:01
Usually you define the protocol. Then it takes time to actually implement it. After doing embedded programming for 20 years, I know this can take lots of time. I've been wrong before tho.
