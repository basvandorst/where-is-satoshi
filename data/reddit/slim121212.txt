If i send bitcoin from Electrum to Bittrex, will i get both BTC and BCC? It would save alot of trouble if that was possible.

you are right, i included the cost for my employer, is it not weird that the employer has to pay the state a big percentage of my salary, for no reason other than that they can do it, i mean wtf does the state have to do with him employing me, 
its something a Mafia would do. in order for me to get 3500 dollar, the employers cost is around 7000-7500.  i get around  4500-5000 before tax, on top of that they are taxing my employe 2000 dollar on top of that. its like a fee in percentage for employing someone.

i can use a knife to kill someone, so it should be illegal, i can kill a person with my car, so cars must be illegal, i can strangle someone with my hands, so my hands should be illegal. This is nothing more than power and control. They dont give a shit about people buying drugs with crypto.

i dont hold any bitcoin, because of these splitting chains, to many hard forks it is a joke. We need one bitcoin only, instead of hard forking just start a new coin and dont put bitcoin name in it. until the last fork i wont buy. i put all my money on eth and curecoin, golem. because i know they will not become ethereum cash, ethereum gold. Bitcoin should stop this forking.

In Sweden we have 60-80 percent tax on income, 50 percent tax on petrol and diesel, even the Mafia in my home country takes less.  
Taxes is good if it goes where it should, but here we have like 50 percent communist 50 percent capitalist,  my salary is 3500 after tax, i have well paying job, before taxes its 7000, so my employer pays 7000 i get 3500. i think that is a bit to much,

yeah i can imagine, i mean i knew it was bad there, from all the news. but i did not know it was really this bad, i had in my mind okey maybe they live with 500 dollar a month wich is considered very poor in my country. 
But this is beyond ridiculous, how has the people not protest to this, like get a few million people to overtake the country kill the politicians, srsly at this point what do the people have to lose, this is no future for their kids.

its basically like a pyramid fraud but in this case, everyone wins, because nobody will take out there money if it keeps doing more than 100 percent a year, so you go on forever putting more and more money in it. and we can never run out of fiat money. all fiat money will be sucked up by bitcoin so governments will have huga amounts of fake money. wich will raise inflation. and price of bitcoin and lower the worth of fiat, in the end we all will be the 1 percent rich people, eventually only a few percent of people gonna sell bitcoin, so there will not be much volume, so then nobody can sell it, because everyone that wants bitcoin already has it. witch will cause panic and then everywone will sell at lower price and it all goes down, then it gous up again and down and up and down until one person sold all bitcoins right before the bubble for huge sum of money, after crash he will buy up everything again, and then we will only have one person who has 99 percent of the bitcoins, this person will then become king of the world.

that would have got me lifelong depression man, 5.7m dollars.

that is just insane, i earn the equivalent of around 3500 dollar in Sweden, and thats after tax, although i earn little bit more than normal people here, normal is 2500 dollar id say. If i were to move to venezuela, i could hire people for 20 dollar each a month, one to cook food for me, one to massage me, one private driver who can drive me around. I would be living like a millionaire.
I really have to add though, i feel extremely sorry for famillies there, having to put up with this shit, im sure it will get better in time.
