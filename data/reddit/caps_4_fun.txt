I voted for Trump because of his promises regarding TPP, trade, and immigration. So far all is going good regarding those. I don't give a shit about these Russian conspiracies or how many pornstars he slept with or what he said on twitter today. Wow I've been duped!

yes, but what makes you think it's not the crypto-currency concept itself that "changes the world" instead of Bitcoin? There are many competing currencies at the moment. No reason to suspect that Bitcoin will remain  When I was in high school, facebook was a joke. Everyone was on myspace. Look at myspace now.

bitcoin was not supposed to be about making money. It's ABOUT REPLACING THE DOLLAR. What is this /r/investing???
