Yes, the market cap of Bitcoin is correlated to the volume of transactions processed over the network.  It's spectrum.  Look at the end close to zero vs. the end in the trillions of dollars per year.  For reference, according to  MasterCard and Visa process have combined annual volume north of $5.3 trillion and a combined Enterprise Value (EV) of around 0.21 trillion, which is 4% of the volume.  The EV is over 10x the annual revenue.  You can do some back-of-the-envelope calcs and run some scenarios if you want, but the point is that the market cap of Bitcoin is correlated to the volume of transactions it processes.

America does not have capitalism, it has fake capitalism, which is really a corrupt system of crony capitalism, designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many.  All these nascent movements we see are signs that people are getting the idea that something is wrong, but they are still divided, as the status quo wants them to be.  Divided, they have no power.  United they do.  The last thing the status quo wants is to see the 99% figure that out.  Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, protesters protesting over the shootings of unarmed black men by white and/or militarized police, etc.  They all know (or are becoming suspicious) the system is rigged against them.  The problem is they are trying to get a new hand delt to them in a rigged game.  They will always lose that game.  The only way to "win" is to change the game.

Yes, monopolists tend to enjoy being monopolists and want to remain monopolists (into perpetuity, if possible).  They will pretty much do "anything" NOT to lose their monopoly position, and the fruits that flow from it.  Not harming themselves is fundamental to that, which in this case includes not harming (or even threatening to harm) the network.

I agree with the statement "concentrating on creating online services and functions that fiat money just can't accomplish."  
And I add the following: "concentrating on creating online services that disrupt the various monopoly and monopoly-like services that we all know and love, such as eBay.  
I would also like to see a Dropbox killer that lets people buy and sell anonymous, secure, P2P storage and whatever the market-clearing price turns out to be, which can even be tiered and tuned in all kinds of ways from near cold-storage for backups to red hot and geo-targeted for caching.  **Basically *Airbnb for hard drives*.**  
The other one I'll mention is something for torrent hosting that would incentivize seeding and "eliminate" dead torrents.  Again, P2P Marketplace FTW.

Find places where consumers get raped on fees and show how Bitcoin disrupts that.  For example, bank accounts and credit cards.  If you use your credit card overseas, they rape you at least two different ways: (1) on the exchange rate, (2) they tack on an additional few percentage points of outright fees because you used your card overseas.  Screw that.  Basically any fee that can be disrupted is a separate video, so highly targeted (the way websites often have many different landing pages, each one targeting a different persona and tied to a different campaign).

A good bit of it is a generational thing.  Bitcoinbugs are the new Goldbugs kind of thing, from an age standpoint.  Similar things happen with many new technologies.  For my generation, the first run-in with this concept was with VCRs.  Old people either didn't get them, at least not right away, and when they did, they often could barely use them and the clock was always blinking.   With respect to gold, the old Goldbugs will die off.  Their kids will inherit their gold.  Some of them will sell some or all of that gold and/or convert to Bitcoins.  Something like that.  I didn't have to to write it up eloquently, but hopefully you get the gist of this "generational" concept I'm referring to and how the guar will change, as nature takes its course, and the reaper comes to collect his souls (and gold).

I actually encourage self help so they Google and read and gain confidence themselves, but some want hand holding, so I'm there.  Most say they have heard of it, but don't know much about it yet.  Once people learn how easy it ease, and the benefits, they won't will be Bitcoin believers.  It reminds me of Internet dating back in 1995.

My terminology needs correcting, but I think the basic idea is right: Being in a pool gives a higher probability of solving the next block and thus earning the BTC reward. The reward is, of course, then split among the pool members, pro rata based on their contributed hash rate / total pool hash rate for that ten minutes. So a higher probability of a smaller reward by being in a pool (vs. a low probability of a high reward for not). What it must boil down to is an expected return calculation, perhaps adjusted for risk and/or other things.

I love the idea.  I was banned for life from selling on Amazon because of an innocent mistake that I corrected myself before they even contacted me.  I was living in an EU country and only wanted to sell to customers in other EU countries.  You could not specify that when you listed a book, so I had to specify that in the comments about the book.  I assumed people read those comments and would abide by my statement that listing was only for EU customers.  Dudes did not abide and ordered anyway.  I emailed them to cancel the order and made my ONLY-EU statement more clear.  Another non-EU customer tried to order.  I cancelled and took down all listings because it was clear people don't read the specs.  THEN, Amazon contacted me and said they were banning me for life for canceling orders.  I tried to explain, but they did not want to hear it and pointed to the "banned for life" statement that the initial Amazon representative issued to me without even asking me what happened and why.  I used to like Amazon, but now I think they are jerks and try to never use them.

SEC doesn't control interest rates. But they are part of the establishment. And Bitcoin is disruption to the establishment. So... nobody should be surprised it was denied. The cronies on the WallSt/Washington gravy train not take money out of their own pockets. That said, when they figure out how to line their own pockets, they will do so (I know, stating the obvious).

The real estate market

It's only confusing to morons. For everybody else, the context lets them know the meaning. Examples: A "shot" can mean many different things, too. But when you go into a bar and order a shot of Jack, the bartender knows what to do. A "buck" can mean many things, but when deer hunters are talking shop, they know they are talking about a deer. It goes on and on like that.

That is not a terrible structure. Because it puts skin in the game of the ones lending the money (theoretically). Except the ones spending the money are ultimately the taxpayers, not the politicians buying the votes.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:35:59
Even for users who have no problem buying, tracking and reporting all the transactions for tax purposes is a HUGE disincentive.

That statistic is basically a contrary market timing indicator. By the time students decide it's a good move take out dischargeable loans to buy stocks, or crypto, or anything else, the asset has probably already made it's big move and is due for a nasty bear market. Same story, different people, asset, and time period. Now many of them are underwater (hopefully not for more than a couple of years, but anything can happen).
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:59:53


What can you actually buy with a loan of that size?

People have forgotten that. Just Google on "bank runs," "bail-ins," etc. During the next crisis, first there will be rush to cash (and Gold and cryptos will be sold), then there will be rush to BTC (cash will be sold).

@_date: 2018-03-28 01:03:38
Probably not, I'm guessing. It's easy to lie with statistics. Just do a non-random sample by mistake. Is it a lie or just a mistake that fits in with the exact narrative I want to tell? Doesn't really matter after it's been read and quoted and posted and re-quoted a thousand times. It's the whole "The Russians elected The Donald" thing.

He's 1000% right to be personally upset by the corporate/military-industrial-political wars. Who knows if Bitcoin can save the world, but it's a step in the right direction, which actually also puts it at great risk of being killed off, somehow, by the status quo controllers, who certainly want to maintain the status quo, pretty much at all costs (a million foreign lives and a thousand domestic whistle blowers is nothing some).

Fund managers run in herds because they care about job security more than being a hero ("nobody ever got fired for buying IBM," as they say). But once that herd starts moving, it eventually turns into a stampede. Look no further than hedge fund ownership of the FAANGs for the current case in point. Also look at their charts for Friday and you will see what happens when the herd sniffs out that the next turn is into the slaughterer's hammer.
