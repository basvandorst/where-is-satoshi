Samourai also creates change you moron,
The tweet is stupid, but you make a moronic and uninformed assumption too.

You need to download and run the piece of software they offer called 'Dojo'

I know, I have been using it for many years :)
Just trying to work out why wasabi has gained such popularity despite joinmarket
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:29:48
If joinmarket had the GUI and marketing fan fair that Wasabi spent their deceptively gained donations on, I'm sure joinmarket would the best, most commonly used privacy solution available to us today.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:31:28
Thank you for doing this, it's why in my opinion Wasabi will never gain traction, or rather someone will fork it without the fees,
It's the reason I was so disappointed after donating large amounts to Wasabi before the fees were announced, because with such fees, the masses will never adopt it, effectively eliminating the possibility of it being a privacy solution that doesn't get blacklisted within bitcoin. Because the transactions will be so few, they will be easily identifiable and persecuted.
p.s. thank you for the whirlpool guide! I have been looking for one. Do you have a tipping address?

mix 100 :D
but yes, I do feel these approaches to coinjoin are creating a false security of sorts

It's good these wallets are stress testing each other. People should appreciate it as such and try not to let personal opinions of developers shade their decisions.
Luke-jr is a good example of an incredible developer, who has given so much to bitcoin, who's views are sometimes discredited just because people don't like his opinions.

read up a little on BISQ and the concept of open source before you come in here spewing your nonsense in an attempt to sound smart ;)

Pine was a fucking hero, I do hope she found a long term sense of peace with these actions as I know she, like many of us, struggle with such responsibilities of being an early adopter.
Much love Pine

You are obviously wet behind the3 ears if you have not heard of rootstock, but bounties are normal in the tech space. Consider deleting your comments and doing a little research before you react in the future.

satoshi's work theo,
Do you have a donation address?
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:41:24
and someone donated 6+ BTC to joinmarket, good day for privacy :)
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:49:23
It's not exactly the point I was making in relation to donations
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:58:48
This useless mining pool has been mining empty blocks, we thought this would stop after covert asic boost was prevented. If you use them as a miner, please leave!
Also I see the argument that 'dusting attacks' are an attempt to violate privacy, it seems much more likely to me they are an attempt to push up fees as they increase the size taken up by a TX involving them, so are likely carried out by a foul playing pool.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:07:23
The wallet has spent a total of 92.14623097, where did the other payments go to u/pwuille
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:38:37
I believe the privacy needs to be implemented at protocol level, and I know people are working on that.
Also are we not worried about these very large transactions bloating the chain?
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:50:09
I dont think having 10 BTC you want to spend, splitting it into 100 x 0.1 BTC denominations then recombining them does anything to save space
Also wasabi doesnt allow you to pay to the payee, you have to transact into wasabi, transact in the mix then transact out.. In no way is any of this scalable
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:20:29
yes indeed its open source, I hope someone will fork it.
As I understand nopara runs the only server, so really the code needs a professional audit, as this is a major vulnerability in my uneducated opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:00:24
seems someone just made a good donation to your public address :p
u/nopara73 how long does it take for you to make 6 btc through wasabi? Maybe you will see the advantage of creating a software based on donations and the option for anyone to run a server
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:03:02
in what way is it not? You think the privacy issue has been solved? hahaha
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:48:53
Oh yes, you are correct
@_date: 2019-05-30 08:19:53
How was the payout divided? I do hope u/belcher_ and joinmarket got the lions share, they have done far more in terms of development of the underlying technology that have allowed coinjoins to be a reality.
I have donated to Wasabi, joinmarket and the fund itself, but I was very disappointed when I heard u/nopara73 was choosing to steer the project in a centralised way so he could collect fees. Not only did I feel my money was misplaced but I feel this project as it is structured will be shut down in the same way we have seen clearnet mixer shut down recently, I can see little difference in responsibility here, and I doubt the police will either.
