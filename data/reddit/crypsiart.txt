Knew this exchange was going to damage my name
If you dont want your bitcoin - you can send them to me and will be used for pro-bitcoin graffiti + to support the btcoffensive against banks and other corrupt financial institutions?

bitcoin mentioned twice vs P2P system 10 times? 
reading anything a bank writes you have to read between the lines and reliance on regulators is implied
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:26:08
Please just promise to let anyone use the patents (except corrupt global banks or exchanges funded by them) 
oh shit....
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:53:39
wonder what they are avoiding referring to when they say 'a P2P network'?....
So banks are 'relying on regulators' to disrupt bitcoin (as it says at bottom) 
Let's just hope there are regulators out there that are not completely corrupt (would have to be outside NY/ Russia/ Thailand/ Ecuador..)

which ones? mish mash of images and some digital art (love comics though - will have to check them out)
@_date: 2015-11-20 04:01:37
good point about the untraceable being traced! Lack of any research by media is pretty scary though and the fact that original article by DW is still up/ still includes the $23million even though journalist has disowned it (claimed it has been corrected but it hasnt)

lost me there?
@_date: 2015-11-20 03:38:23
exactly, but reasoning behind not releasing it dont add up??

I would just like to make it clear that Crypsi, crypsi.com, crypart and crypart.com are in no way affiliated with Cryptsy 
Holding coins in an exchange is asking to lose them- get yourself some crypart instead....

Sneak preview of some new crypart
- what do you think about title?
Also thinking about making this one (and a few others) posters (which would be cheaper than art currently available), though imagine people might want it framed (each bespoke to include QR code of choice, eg bitcoin wallet), so cost would be similar to some of the smaller box canvases on the site  - what do you think?
Any feeedback (or tips!) appreciated

Who care's what the incentive is - as with the stress test this is illegal
The idiots behind the stress test tried to be clever - but this makes no difference when the intention is to harm a regulated market/ commodity - they should be prosecuted (otherwise why have laws?)
Bitcoin community should be trying to ID the perpetrators and report them to every regulatory body in the world that 'regulates bitcoin'
If the CFTC see it as a commodity, then this is no different to messing with the gold or corn markets/ systems
SEC also has a duty to investigate and bring criminal prosecution (otherwise why are they collecting fees if they are not prepared to 'regulate'?)
Bad actors need to be removed from the game, no mercy, throw them in jail for at least 5 years...

If bitcoin cannot persuade (or does not want) Anonymous to help promote bitcoin as an alternative to current banking system, then it has got so lost, it does not deserve to exist....

Is r/bitcoin dying? Got more interest/ suggestions on Facebook?!!
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:04:48
The World Bank described bitcoin as a 'naturally occurring ponzi scheme' - presuming they are right (and who are we to argue), then ALL alt coins are not naturally occurring - so any coins created to enrich the initial owners/ miners etc are surely by definition 'orchestrated' 
bitcoin was an 'experiment' - it was not known for sure if it could work and get anywhere, alt coins are generally designed as pump and dump/ get rush quick schemes and seeing as creators generally are too arrogant to want to hide identities, then arguably they could and should be jailed with all assets confiscated..
People who actively support ponzis also tend to get thrown in jail - anyone who supports crap like Ripple deserves it more than Shrem anyways..
Grandpas these days are so complacent...

UPDATE 
Crypsicoin White Paper is now complete.
It is double the size of any previous alt coin's white paper and is sooo white, you might think it is just blank sheets. 
This is 7.0 technology, which is why mere mortals might not be able to see the hugely detailed technical specifications and groundbreaking consensus systems hidden within the paper.
Due to unprecedented investor appetite, we will launch pre-sale for crypsicoin immediately and astronomical returns in advance on the crowdsale are 2000% guaranteed.
Advisors already signed up include Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci and Jesus of Nazareth (all of whom we will resurrect using DNA sequencing), plus Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Price will of course go up forever and allow you to sit on your butt and get high for the rest of your life
CRYPSICOIN - CAN YOU AFFORD NOT TO?

2 things to note:
1) They are getting desperate as IBM/ bitreverse &amp; lots of others try to sell technology to banks (who will just develop it themselves). They have been trying to lobby their awful product to banks for years and got nowhere..
2) They are an ORCHESTRATED PONZI SCHEME (if bitcoin is naturally occurring XRP isn't)
Barry Silbert, Andreessen Horrowitz etc might not like it, but this should get them all thrown in jail if the authorities do their jobs right and let's hope so too...

If you can code, how about Global Head of Compliance?
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:24:49
many thanks - tip (via twitter) on the way to CIA and anyone else I can think of that might cause some trouble (promise if they don't collect will try again in a more aggressive manner…)
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:05:01
We're onto something here- if there is no ledger/ records at all crypsicoin can be completely anonymous and untraceable 
Thinking we use a 'proof of steak' model (PoW won't work as I don't have a PC powerful to mine more than the first few blocks and we don't want anyone else getting a decent share)
'Mining' can be done by sending me bitcoins/ cash so we can live off steak, champagne and caviar (we can scan/ email receipts to investors which will each represent 1 crypsicoin)
Finite limit of 2billion crypsicoins, only 1.9billion of which will be pre-allocated to core-dev
Already got IBM on the phone wanting to sign up...
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:31:47
'intent' is the most important consideration- point is if these regulators are going to take fees for licences etc then they surely have a duty to protect the markets they are 'regulating'?

great recent article/ interview explaining Anonymous:

Thanks to all who entered and picture should appear on  in coming weeks...

I'll accept 4BTC if you send in next 5 min, don't think, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to rule the world...
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:09:06
Will also launch a new wallet app (thinking of calling it GoxER) that will be superior to every other wallet out there, as they will be 100% secure
You will be able to receive bitcoins, but 'send' functionality will not be available to anyone other than me...
Illegal crowdsale using crypsicoin coming soon...

Don't want you near our systems if you have looked at PHP before- but if you drink, you can be the Global Head Dog, Customer Relations
Salary is 1 crypsicoin per week and you can earn up to 100% of the coin supply if you can bring in 10,000BTC (at this point you won't hear from me again)
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:48:09
way too over-qualified I'm afraid- applicants must be:
a) under 20 years old 
b) have no previous computing experience other than Xbox/ PS
c) preferably kicked out of school for drugs 
candidates who cannot speak english preferred

Blythe Masters should be rotting in a jail cell - other than raising Adolf Hitler from the grave can't think of anyone less appealing to be involved in blockchain (keep her as far away from bitcoin as possible...)

ready when you are, simply send btc to my illegal graffiti fund on twitter ( and I'll invent however many crypsicoins you would like/ send you an official presale official certificate of ownership (scribbled on the back of a McDonald's receipt)

Perfect, the 7,000BTC will be held in a private escrow against the Crypsicoin I can write an IOU for, sound ok?
