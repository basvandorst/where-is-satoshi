What would be cheapest way to transfer bitcoin from coinbase to binance(fiat is on coinbase already)?
I was thinking different options:    
* buy BTC and transfer to binance wallet    
* buy ETH and transfer to binance wallet and buy BTC with ETH    
* buy LTC and transfer to binance wallet and buy BTC with LTC    
* buy BTC and transfer to ledger and from ledger to binance (not sure this makes sense?)
