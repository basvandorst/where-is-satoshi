I remember back last year when I first started following here it was sub 30,000 and bitcoin was $69 a pop. It has been incredible to say the least to be apart of this growth and I cannot wait for the future.

He said 1%
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:31:01
I didn't hear a reason as to why you smashed it?
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:45:41
Someone in the press is going to think you are the actual president of bitcoin I guarantee it
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:59:15
There's this crazy new thing called a joke they're all the rage now apparently
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:24:42
No shut up he's being edgy!
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:27:49
It's actually about two bored rich people and the rest are butthurt that this idea was even proposed
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:33:54
Sort of. Yes they funded Al-Qaeda, but they funded them as a militant group fighting against an aggressor. They weren't participating in activities deemed as terrorism at the time the funding occurred. So sure the government funded a group that ultimately resorted to terrorist activities, but the implication of your statement is that we explicitly and knowingly funded terrorism which simply isn't the case. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:10:07
Because they are biased i would imagine.

What was the USD value of a bitcoin at IPO? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:10:24
It's currently only fractional to 8 decimal places, making it go to more decimal places is possible but will take a ton of work and coordination if it ever needs to come to that
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:53:32
would it be possible to link the prices of products on the site to, say, the current MtGox exchange rate, and have the bitcoin prices constantly updating to keep the desired margin? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:18:20
What you just said, and what that sentence says, are the same thing.
When speaking to redandwhite, DPR referenced the previous 80k he paid for murder, while talking to redandwhite about killing FriendlyChemist for 150k.

The way I understand it, the ETF will make bitcoin accessible to those who already trade (professionally) in fiat stocks/bonds/other investments. This does two things: 1) It will increase the day to day volume of trade massively and 2) It will significantly increase the liquidity of bitcoin.
The increase in demand combined with the value of increased liquidity would, presumably, significantly increase the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-26 16:11:04
Well presumably he'd actually be paying for the rights in USD, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:09:03
I get that, but the appreciation/depreciation of bitcoin still has to be taken into account, given the volatility of the market.  You're left with the same amount of bitcoins, but they're worth a lot more USD than they were.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:01:04
I don't get why there aren't more companies like bitpay coming out of the woodwork, there is clear large potential for growth.
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:08:34
It's not correct. Lawyers get 10-20% of the total sum in a class action. Then the majority of the money is split between all the people who are in the class action. So individually, each person receives very little money, but the Lawyers do make a nice chunk of change. They definitely don't take 90% though.
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:18:11
All hail the king.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:00:52
"Trading for over $18 dollars a BTC" Ohhh how I wish
@_date: 2013-08-24 20:15:44
Ok.. So the lawyers got 30% and they made a special circumstance for the rest of the payment. The lawyers didn't take 90% and in most class-actions the plaintiffs do take a cut. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 16:27:07
I think mid-August is when it will be ready.
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:42:55
Amen to that. All praise be to Bernanke.

But it's infrastructure is created and run by humans.
@_date: 2013-08-28 11:20:29
K, how many Bitcoin do you want to bet that the US government will regulate the currency? Put your money where your mouth is, if you're so sure you can "subvert the paradigm".
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:42:05
The funding of terrorism occurs with that money sure, it's impossible to stop entirely. But they actively try to prevent it with regulation.
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:32:16
So what is it then?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:13:20
And to think someone paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza a two years ago...
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:41:03
Supposedly Coolio's collection rakes in about 23K in royalties each year. But I agree with the sentiment that the music industry is not exactly at it's strongest.
@_date: 2013-07-18 11:16:58
So they didn't really "break even" right? The value of bitcoin increased 800%
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:19:03
The BIT only allows accredited investors to invest, so were talking about high net worth individuals. It's still impressive, but that's not totally crazy.

He just posted exactly what the title of the article is...
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:23:45
Not quite, they have more protections in place than to just hope it doesn't drop but it will be rough on them

Hahah what this is so awesome. Someone needs to tweet at brett.
@_date: 2013-07-13 05:54:20
 Haha whoops. Yeah 1,000 BTC/USD would not be so good. embarrassing typo on my part, especially considering I have a degree in Economics :(
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:11:13
Each coin worth 100 grand. ~12,000,000 coins in circulation. A nice little market cap of $1,200,000,000,000. Sounds legit
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:13:54


Oh god, I didn't even think about this, but you're totally right. He's probably going to go on some tirade about freedom and releasing the bonds of government. That's not going to go over well in court. He's going to be in jail for the rest of his life :(
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:25:58
If I've read the regulations for being a legitimate MSB in the U.S. correctly, then in order for people outside the United States to be "level 2 verified", the verification standards are going to be even more strict than what they are now.
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:56:25
I'm not saying it's effective, I'm just saying that do try and "fight" it
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:11:03
Sold slightly over 200 after the flash crash and fast recovery. Planning to buy back in soon as well and increase my stake
@_date: 2013-08-22 17:36:08
It's actually pretty refreshing to hear someone who is hesitant or doubtful admit that they don't actually really know how it works. So many naysayers out there diss it instantly without even taking a second to research and learn. How can you possibly know that it won't work/ is stupid if you haven't taklen the time to learn about it?
@_date: 2013-10-07 13:10:14
I don't think there are too many prisoners who are savvy to BTC
@_date: 2013-08-26 16:11:38
Yeah, I'm not too sure on the logistics, I just thought it was a funny/cool idea.
@_date: 2013-08-14 00:52:00
Thanks 
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:05:51
[DealCoin]( will be starting up soon. Maybe you should take a look into them.
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:52:18
That's a fair point. If I had any photoshop skills at all I would replace it with a smartphone showing a QR code, but alas I have no such skill.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:23:35
I still love the idea an "Internet" being at least some measure of BTC
@_date: 2013-08-19 23:26:57
Both, really.
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:55:10
They weren't considered terrorists by the U.S. government at that point.
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:32:06
That's a bit of a stretch...
@_date: 2013-08-27 16:56:24
They aren't regulating the entire currency, they are determining how dealing with the currency will work in their country. Look, all of us would prefer that bitcoin remain untouched by any government entity. But the fact of the matter is that it *is* going to happen. So, you can keep fighting it and get fucked in the ass by the government, *or* you can work alongside the government and end up with the best result possible given the circumstances.
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:57:11
No they hold onto the bitcoins from the seller and transfer the bitcoins to the person that paid the seller, pretty much like an escrow service.. It's definitely an MSB.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:52:51
you're awesome!
@_date: 2013-08-13 12:48:44
Right but governments get to control those currencies.
@_date: 2013-08-28 02:48:02
It surely is and you idealist naive fools are the ones that would ruin the existence of bitcoins if you were in charge. The Bitcoin Foundation actually lives in reality and knows how it works, that's why they are taking proactive measures to help the cause, not just act like fucking toddlers who have to have it their way with no compromise. All these Libertarians want to live out their bitcoin wet dream and it's just not going to happen, I'm sorry. I'm not a government shill, I just understand that the government is an *extremely* powerful entity and bitching and moaning won't do anything to help at all.
