Hi Doug,
Nice concept. I will definitely have a look into this. On your homepage it says potential audience of billions. Can you explain that bit please?

I am part of a team that does this kind of show every day but for traditional markets. We occasionally have the odd expert who comes and talks bitcoin, but I have been cheerleading for a bitcoin show for a while now.

I think the point is that people dismiss Bitcoin as being a bubble - like the Tulip bubble. His point is that the Tulip industry is still massive, and even if this is a bubble in Bitcoin, it doesn't mean that digital currency is going away.

I agree.
I see a lot of market commentators warning of a coming crash. Bitcoin serves a safe haven in these instances and an alternative to gold in some respects. 
I still remember the Cyprus crisis and the Bitcoin bounce then.

Thats a fair point. He was meaning that Bitcoin is now established and is not going to crash and disappear.

Couple of suits that have had personal oversight over tens of billions of investable assets, talking about what they think is the next big shift in global markets.
Having guys like this gushing over digital currencies is what incrementally builds credibility, at a time when the general public are interested but still a bit hands off.

There was initially a bubble, a crash, and now tech is the main driver of the modern economy.

It is now an integral part of almost every component of every industry. I appreciate that this is a sweeping statement, but I can't think of an example where Tech hasn't played an integral role.

i would think that there is a fair chance that they have already heard about bitcoin
