Holy shit awesome. Thanks!

Coinbase is still trying to make more money off of BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:30:14
It's cool. App is great though. If you added usd price alerts that'd be ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:09:05
I laughed so hard at this
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:12:56
Damn so salty

I really enjoy coming into these subs when I'm panicing about my portfolio. Good energy guys. I feel better.

Locked out of coinbase :( Gemini won't accept my bank and bitstamp doesn't seem to accept wires from my country. I want to buy the dip but i can't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:14
They don't appear to take US banks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:02
I really just think it's all the new people having their first freakout.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:11:08
Sooooo don't use anything and stop investing completely. There aren't enough ways to get into the market from fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:16:12
I always make all the wrong decisions.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:29:05
omg i need more money to invest.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:30:43
Life is also cheaper there. The US has the highest wealth inequality in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:26:49
I'm not being racist, I'm pointing out that a lot of Americans imply that we don't have a poverty problem when we certainly do.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:07:31
ITT Holy shit people are upset.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:00:28
There's a lot of poverty in the US too.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:21
Whoa. I was so naive.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:01:27
They'll probably just start claiming to be something else.

What's the general consensus about the segwit2x fork in terms of which chain is the "real" bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:50:11
What was your tax situation like with this?
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:10:58
There isn't a lot of entry points into the crypto word that aren't coinbase.

Why is 8MB blocks bad? I feel like it's a good idea especially with quantum computers on the horizon? Serious question I know I'm ignant.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:13:36
Can someone make a guide for this? If I store my coins in electrum will it immediately support the BCC so I can send and sell it? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:41:18
Man chill out. I said at the end that I'm ignorant I'm just asking questions to try to learn. My interpretation of the REASON the blocksize was going to get increased was because it made the mining problems harder and so would insulate against these new computers (quantum computers) being able to produce artificially longer blocks by doing far more calculations and manipulate the ledger. If that is not the case I do not know why they are pushing for larger blocksizes. I would appreciate an answer rather than bitchiness if possible.

As far as I know, in order to buy from Coinbase you need to sign up. That's why they "get 100,000 new users in a month". Especially since they are one of like 2.5 options for it.
And yeah, I send all my coin over to bittrex, but if I want to use fiat to invest more into the market, I still have to be "USING THEM".
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:25:15
Thanks for all the information. I went back and watched some of the videos I watched last week and think I must have misunderstood some of the things I've heard. Sounds like this is going to be bad for both sides of the fork initially but hopefully it ends up favoring the miners in the long run. 
Follow up on the quantum being bad at hashing - what is the idea behind coins like QRL? What are they claiming to protect against then? I think that's where I started to get led astray because I was under the impression that this was a looming concern.
Thanks again.
Edit: Also why is the Segwit camp also increasing blocksize if it's bad for small miners? What is the objective benefit of it?
Edit2: I think I saw something like this:  and I assumed that bigger block size would mean you'd have to beat more "problems" to seal a block. Clearly there are some gaps in my understanding.

Look what you did

They accept fiat and have an easy interface. Nobody else provides this that I've found.
