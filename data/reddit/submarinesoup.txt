So you're saying there's no way to predict what will happen. And you're right.

It has its ups and downs. Not sure why you got downvoted for asking; maybe an upvote will restore your faith in humanity

I find this post misguided.
If OP really wants bitcoin to take off, surely he realizes that widespread use is the key to bitcoin's success. This post, on the other hand, suggests that bitcoin is at its best as a niche currency.
But the beauty of bitcoin lies in its accessibility. It's a *good* thing that it's so easy to get bitcoins. Besides, it's just as easy to drop your wallet or hand your credit card to an unsavory service worker. The difference is that bitcoin loss won't result in identity theft. The loss is finite, with the hard cap being the size of the wallet. It can take years to recover from having one's identity stolen.
tl;dr - I respectfully disagree with OP's point of view and am a proponent of the "don't put all your eggs in one basket" approach (i.e. having more than one bitcoin wallet to mitigate potential loss).

Is that a picture of bitcoin's dong?

This guy is really ballsy! He is walking into thorny territory ethically simply because lawyers are subject to regulations re: the way client funds are accepted and handled. *See e.g.* [ABA Model Rule 1.5](
I'd be really interested to know how he's handling this!
edit: before I get downvoted, I want everyone to know that I like this idea. This fellow is doing important work by raising complex issues of law related to bitcoin, specifically about bitcoin's fungibility with fiat currency. I'm pulling for him, but make no mistake: he's sticking his neck out.

Imagining a guy questioning his worldview over a bitcoin bubble made me lol.
"I'm starting to worry about bitcointrading. Ever since bitcoin hit $5.1k, he's been living in a shack in the woods smoking peyote..."

Have an upvote in acknowledgement of our shared misfortune.

I don't think bitcoin against the gold standard is a very good comparison, but to each his own.
