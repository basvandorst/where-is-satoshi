I don't think anyone honestly cares, Dr-Slay.

If you wish for me to comprehend your replies need to be rationally composed.  Maybe take a break, clear your mind, review this thread again and see if you can understand why no sane person would ever make sense of your thought process. Then rewrite the answer to this statement : "I don't care about you" in a way that makes sense to other people and in an attempt to win me over into caring about you.
@_date: 2019-12-04 01:28:47
Okay okay! I care! You got me.
So where do I go from here?
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:34:47
I don't care if you believe me or not.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:31:27
It doesn't matter to me what "you" care about.
The question at hand is how to make "me" care about your opinion.
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:17:21
You're right.  Your stupidity is rather addictive.
Nevertheless I still don't care about your opinion.  I just want to see how far you're willing to take this.  It's like watching a train wreck.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:54:04
I already explained why I keep replying.  It's not for the reasons you believe.
And I'm a pro at multitasking ;)
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:33:37
Nope.  Sorry try again.  Still not convinced.
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:10:33
Uh huh.  Go on..
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:47:36
I just made $1605 while you were being stupid.
@_date: 2019-12-01 13:07:32
I don't have anything to add because I simply don't care.  Nobody here cares about trolls.  We're not interested in changing your miserable mind. At the most you provide comic relief and occasionally breakfast for the rest of us.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:23:20
Holy shit.  Thanks for making my week :)
@_date: 2019-12-03 20:47:53
I still don't care.
Mostly because I never brought up any of the things you just mentioned.
This is a festival of nonsequiturs.  It's like you think you're continuing a conversation with a completely different person.
So yeah, there's that.   Indifferent.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:46:50
And back we go to the beginning. 
I don't care.  Convince me otherwise.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:28:31
Mmkay. 
Moving on.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:02:19
Convince me why I should care and I will engage.
