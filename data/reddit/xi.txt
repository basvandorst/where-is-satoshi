I don't know much about the Electrum wallet but I imagine you would be able to send $10 to many individual addresses in one transaction. 
This would be far cheaper than doing them seperately. 
In terms of how low a fee could you get away with? This depends how quickly you need it to confirm but it sounds like it would be fine if it took a while, so you could set a fairly low fee. It depends how congested the network is, and it can be pretty crazy at the moment with the high price, so the following could change/increase, you do need to do verify it. But generally a fee of 150-200 satoshi per byte will get confirmed reasonably quickly. If you want it very quick, maybe 200-250 would do it. But if you can risk waiting a day or 2, maybe 50-100 satoshi per byte would be fine.
 is very good.
For reference, a typical transaction is 225 bytes. If your transaction has multiple addresses as outputs it will obviously be bigger and need the fee adjusting accordingly, but will still be cheaper than doing them individually.
Nice idea btw, and not that it's any of my business and obviously I don't know you or the people you're gifting, but I kinda think with the current level of transaction fees and congestion it would almost be more trouble than it's worth for them to do anything with $10 worth. Unless they're fairly computer literate or have some interest in crypto already, obviously then it's awesome, but otherwise they might just let it sit there. Good luck with it though, I still hope you follow up on it in one way or another.
