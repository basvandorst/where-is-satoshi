I understand where you are coming from. 
However, the question for me really is how to move toward a transition. 100% on bitcoin (or other cryptos) is not feasible currently. Little things like mortgage, utility bills, food still need to be paid in fiat :) 
Given this, I’m looking for a way to have as little exposure as possible to the current financial system, while still managing regular fiscal responsibilities. 
I should note that crypto is not my main income source by any means, but I am starting to think about how to make this transition.
Am I being clear? Thanks again for engaging in this conversation.

Thank you for your response. Regarding taxes, this is something that I felt I had to address up front given the nature of my stance toward regulation in my other posts. 
Here are my strategic questions: 
-Finding a financial institution that allows you to have accounts in BTC or another currency with varying amounts of fiat  (but a lower percentage)
-Using the same bank to pay bills, electronically via crypto balances, (payments are automatically exchanged to fiat of choice), etc. 
-Using crypto debit cards that allow you to use crypto to get cash in fiat, set up recurring online transactions, withdraw from atms, etc. 
Other strategies to live and pay for daily life in a smoother fashion than cashing out fiat in bulk to a traditional bank, which is unwieldy and time consuming. For example, being able to exchange crypto for fiat within the same account (at whatever limit would be great.)

Thank you! This was exactly what I was looking for. 
I very much appreciate you taking time to educate me further on this. I will study this closely.

Thanks. Intentions are pure. Not looking to avoid taxation, etc, even though I have a negative view of the current regulatory environment in some key respects. Don’t need the hassles associated with tax avoidance issues. 
Just want some practical strategies for more smoothly living on crypto assets given the current state of adoption.
