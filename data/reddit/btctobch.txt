Did you read their original distribution plan?  It outlined why they were not able to distribute 1:1.  It makes perfect sense.  It's *possible* that there is more to the story, but honestly the story checks out in my opinion.  Here's an example to explain:
You and I are the only traders on Bitfinex.  I deposit 2 BTC.  You deposit 1 BTC and $2700.  Bitfinex now holds 3 BTC and $2700.
I place my 2 BTC into margin wallet, and you place your 1 BTC into lending wallet.  I borrow 1 BTC from you.  I then sell that 1 BTC to you in a margin-short, while you purchase it in the regular exchange with your $2700.
My position is 2 BTC in wallet, and 1 BTC short.  You own 2 BTC.
Now the fork occurs.  All the accounts (you and I) combined for 4 BTC which qualify.  Bitfinex only has 3 BTC.  If you want to consider this a fractional system thats alright, but it's not as if bitfinex has lost some of the deposits.  They still hold the 3 BTC + $2700.  So according to their policy, they will divide the BCH they own (3) by the eligible BTC (4).  This gives a 75% distribution rate, exactly as they explained.  They are not pocketing any BCH.  They never lost any BTC.  It's perfectly fair according to their initial rules.

Wow, Bitfinex just completely screwed over people who followed their original guidelines for BCH distribution.
They are calling it "manipulation" to store BTC in a margin account and hedge them with a short.  They explicitly stated this would credit BCH.  There was no doubt people would take advantage of this, and they even said it was an imperfect system but they would go with it.  Myself and others made decisions and trades based on this policy, now they are not honoring it.
Not only are they stiffing the promised BCH, but they are calling these users out as manipulators.  WTF

If you are referring to the 85% distribution rate, your stated reason isn't the cause.

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.  Bitfinex didn't distribute margin BTC longs as far as I know.
