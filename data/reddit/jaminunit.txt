They don't if they charge you land tax then you never really own the land. Governments steal land all the time from people that actually own it.

Your an idiot. I don't work for you, go find your own charts.  I said adoption curves not stock or shares. The price of bitcoin is reflection of adoption. And more and more people are adopting it.

@_date: 2014-02-16 10:06:39
I use takeaway.com all the time and it is fine. But dude the real problem is that you are using bitstamp. Bitstamp do not instantly deliver coins all the time. If their hot wallet is empty it can take till the next time the hot wallet is filled for them to send your coins. That can take hours. 
What I do is I have 100 bucks worth of coins on my phone at all times for spendable cash. 
That way it works instantly every time. 
An exchange is not a wallet. You w
should print a paper wallet and get it off of bitstamp because when you let other people hold your bitcoin you do not have control of your private keys any more. All you have is and IOU. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:41:23
Thanks for the update. 
I get the feeling that it's going to be fixed. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:08:21
No sorry it's not true. Because the "bear trap" is far to long. I can show you a million charts that look like the bitcoin chart and it then keeps going. Have look at adoption charts of new tech like fridges, colour TV, etc
@_date: 2014-01-29 10:25:44
Fuck licensed trade, it's a sick idea. Why should a government have the write to tell me what I can barter for. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:04:16
It's just stupid to say that. Most businesses will have 1 percent of sales for bitcoin, I'm sure they can afford to keep a little on the side and try to spend it forward. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:54:07
We need a truly anon coin because no business wants their competition knowing all their financial information or who their supplier is. Yes the OP's situation might happen but the business thing will definatly happen and way more and to have free commerce you need anonymity. If you are worried about kidnapping then you should ban cash to. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:32:42
I would say that the free market would deliver that. If there was an exchange that paid an independent 3rd party to verify their cold wallet holdings to what people where holding on the exchange I think most people would use that exchange. 
We don't need regulations. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:54:39
Bullshit.

I think your right PayPal is actually technically a currency because it moves "tokens" within its system. This tokens are pegged to the Fiat they represent. But the question could have been which one of these is a decentralised digital currency.

Oh come on. Every crash has been a natural correction. Anything could have triggered them. You can't move 1000 percent and not expect something to crash it. They are not a cancer they are just 1 option to trade and they have give a lot of nutrients to the bitcoin network over the years
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:04:23
Can everyone stop bashing gox and have some God damb respect. Even if it's just respect for people that have money stuck on gox. It's a scary time and we should support gox so they feel they actually want to stay around. Not hammer them and tell people never to use them. They have been around since the start, they have never run off with coins, they have had battles with governments and banks and this community just keeps bashing on them. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:09:08
Yes if you use 1 address then people can see it. To make it almost impossible you could generate a new deposit address Everytime your website loads. (if your taking donations.) this would make it super hard.

Only me :-( 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:27:32
I agree, I think GOX will be back. They are constantly taking attacks and always bounce back. I'm rooting for you GOX! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:08:52
Me to! 2 days now. But I withdrew btc 2 days earlier and it came through instantly. It's ok they will come through. They have there coins in cold storage and a small hot wallet. There has been a large exit the last couple of days so I think we just have to wait for the next batch. But yes very nerve racking. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:32:11
Well done Mtgox team! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:50:28
Lol im going to write an exchange in assembly! Oh the fun
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:41:01
Well seeing as they have made about 2million bucks in trading fees since Jan 4th I would say they are not insolvent and they would be expensive. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:06:07
Fuck that. Next everyone is going to have to have a cash licence. Oh you want to accept cash then you need a cash license. This is bullshit! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:43:24
Good on you Mtgox! 
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:35:12
Lol kill bitcoin. You can't uninvent the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:08:28
because if you day trade you have to have coins on an exchange!
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:28:14
That was not mark, I think that was the guy that later started ripple. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:15:45
Dude I'm so sorry :( 
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:27:14
Why is this community hell bent on killing Mtgox.? Have have used them from the start and they have done some great things for bitcoin. They also bailed people out when they got hacked a few years back. They have never just run off with everyone's coins. They have had massive attacks from government, banking and this community. I think some support is also good. 
Yes they make mistakes but man they have done so much good stuff also. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:31:35
Yeah I'm waiting for 4 days now. 
I guess people aren't talking about it because they don't want a bigger run on "bank". 
Thanks for your tests. 
I wonder if sepa withdrawals to Europe work? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:18:40
Dude really? your really going to come into the horror story thread and be a fucktart by saying "Why the fuck would you keep BLA BLA BLAH!"
people have money on an exchange to eather cash out or trade. Yeah risky but thats what you do.

@_date: 2017-01-25 05:28:07
Let's just do both segwit and 2 MB Block limit as a hard fork. I don't think there would be much contention because it achieves what both sides want and would let us move on towards the moon
@_date: 2017-01-29 23:05:21
Well it's been 25% for 2 months with a bit of a boost yesterday but only because of luck because one miner that was signalling found more blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:23:41
Need segwit and blocksize limit increase, then everyone is happy and we move on

I rember all this going down, Peter is such a scum bag! A piece of filth that leaches of other people's success, other people's failure and other peoples miss fortune. A sick man. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:28:39
I don't think so because both segwit and 2mb we will have about 3.7mb space and lightning network will let us bundle most tx into channels 
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:26:15
I realise that too but thats not my point. My point is that there is a road block and if both parties come together then it's non contentious and we can move forward. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:21:14
As far as I understand it, the mechanism works very diferant. In bitcoin if you want to change somthing that happened 5 days ago you would have to change what happened and then mine faster then every one else to catch up to 5 days. Mean while every tx that happened in those 5 days gets reversed. One must do this because every block is hashed with the last. So reversing a tx more than 10 blocks is pretty much impossible. Ethereum, as I understand it was able to change a select transactions to do with the DAO from a couple of weeks early so didn't need to roll back every other tx between the dao hack and the fork. This is not about decentralisation but immutability is kinda broken. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:27:25
They will go for a massive pump when bitcoins bull run pauses by buying all ether back. 
I have seen many use the same tactic doge coin used. Be all friendly to bitcoiners face but then bag them in their own communities. This makes us welcome them and let them market and piggy back on the hard work the bitcoin community had put in. I have seen eth holders saying "we are not trying to be money" and then in say "pfff bitcoin is old and we can do money plus a lot more." most are ETH maximalist while pretending to not be. Trojen horse.   
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:54:18
For now
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:30:04
No, it's so that we can get segwit past the big blocker blockade that is stopping it getting through as a soft fork. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:02:27

@_date: 2016-12-28 04:59:53
And there's a train on the front! 
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:04:21
Came here to say this
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:29:47
Yes you would keep the original and then if someone needs proof that it has not been manipulated or changed they can rehash the original and compare it to the hash in the bc
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:12:58
I use bitcoin all the time. When I do I rebuy. As a store of value it is also important but using it is just as important. 
@_date: 2019-08-01 09:50:25
I don't think it can get rid of lawyers but trustless time stamping is definitely a really cool use case of on chain bitcoin txs. Being able to prove something happened at a certain time by just rehashing the original image when needed to show proof is fantastic.
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:31:36
Yes, in the future if the couple needs to prove that they have been married since this date they would send a copy of the original image and the authority could just hash it with Sha256 and compare the hashes. This would prove that the couple have the same certificate without manipulation.
@_date: 2017-04-15 11:33:03
I'm dusting off my old rig. 
Will be hashing some scrypt so we can show these fools what segwit can do
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:47:46
I Second that, I did use bitstamp for ages but converting to euros from USD was too expensive. Love vaultoro too, I'm starting to hold gold instead of fiat and am finding my self buying more with bitcoin by selling the gold. Now I just need to get paid in bitcoin and I'm out of the fiat mess! 
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:19:05
Satoshi pay is really cool. I have always had a problem with paywalls but this is different because you pay per paragraph of text read. So if I get board of an article I leave and don't feel I have paid for something I didn't like or didn't want to pay for.

Not all people live in the US. Why does everyone give US tax advice? You know there are other counties right? (Nit pointed at you, more just a general gripe at this sub always talking US laws. In Germany, you pay no cap gains tax after a year, and if you spend it on goods, you also pay no cap gains. In Russia, there is very very little tax on it at all, and many many many other countries all have different laws. Americans always just jump to the conclusion that everyone lives there. It's kinda weird.

Sometimes they get so many people withdrawing that the hot wallet gets depleted. Most exchanges keep a lot in Cold storage and there is a lot of protocol to go through to access cold storage to relaid the hot wallet.

I open bitcoin QT, it has 1 bitcoin on it already.

Im not super technicle although I know the basics. What im saying is that you have a sepperate server cluster load balanced for the home page And must file a proof of work to touch the actual trading engine hosted on another server cluster.
I guess they will find the ip of the trading engine and smash that with packets. Hmmmmm What if they used namecoin to randomise the ip address of the trading engine. Im just throwing creative ideas around.not sure of the technicals

Yeah but people need somthing to explain it and gold is actually kinda close. The reasons states stopped useing gold is not because its bad as currency but because they cant print it to rais money for empire building wars. Bitcoin is only diferant to gold because it instantly transferable. And litecoin is kinda the silver to bitcoins gold. Hmmm interesting times.

Great post, thanks
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:45:40
Yes I have but I was asking on behalf of my friend. :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:48:04
Oh just go away with your regulations! Its just like bullies at school. "Oh hey thats popular now so I want to control it."
 
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:48:25
What if.....
You could only draw out of the system what you put in.
So you have to put money into the system first. 
And to be the random guy in step 6 you can only draw out the amount of fiat that you originally put in.
Any capital gains you made in bitcoin will have to be spent as bitcoin or you could risk it on a centralised exchange.
The Genesis random guy/girl would have to be super trustworthy.  But then it would quickly grow.
There is no real way to steel cash because your only getting back what you put in.

Yeah but the UN is run by global banking interests at the top. Best leave them out of this revolution and bring the tech to them using market forces.
@_date: 2013-05-22 22:35:34
Great talk.
I loved tipping from the QR on the video.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:39:03
Actually the problem banks would have is that they are built on fractional reserves when it comes to loaning out cash. They would have to own the bitcoin to loan out and would you really want a loan in bitcoin anyway? Next week you have to pay double the value back. Lol and then interest on top of that. The only function I see for banks are ewallets that are secure and insured for a fee. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 22:52:06
Thanks, fixed.

Hi guys,
Yes I got confirmation from Christopher Goebel That he got the .3:)
If anyone can help this poor guy out please visit 
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:35:57
Dude, I'm so sorry to hear this. Can you remember any dodgy software you might of installed? 
Do you think your mac or your Linux machine was compromised? Man I think this is the biggest issue. Come on someone develop a dedicated hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:31:54
Thanks for supporting litecoin! I think most alt coins are just stupid but LTC is scrypt based and its nice to diversify into a few block chains.
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:57:24
:-D it has showed staying power, I think it's over 3 years old now
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:56:16

@_date: 2013-05-04 13:55:03
Brother JF called the dip yesterday. He is a man I respect very much in the silver and bitcoin markets.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:54:48
Everyone keeps talking about a p2p trading network.
It would be good to have a GPS system where you could say you have bitcoin for sale and see on the phone if there is anyone near you that is willing to sell crypto for cash.  then you could pm them and meet at a cafe and trade.
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:37:13
What a brave champion! Bravo to this man. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 09:13:23
Damb it! It's not a replacement currency! its just in competition. 
People are so brainwashed as to think there can only be 1 currency. Competition creates a fair market place. USD will still be around but will have to compete.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:43:33
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:56:46
I would recomending diversifying into litecoin to. Diversifying into multible blockchains is a clever strategy. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:50:43
You don't have to buy dollars. How do you get normal USD? You work for them or you sell goods for them. You can also do that with BTC. Staying within the BTC economy (wich is hard at the moment but getting easyer by the day) is the best way to minimise fees to silly low. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:55:29
I love the idea of mutually assured destruction to create incentive to make the p2p trade go through.
@_date: 2013-06-19 20:56:05
Man I wish this was happening 3 years ago when I lived in Sydney
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:45:00

@_date: 2013-06-20 08:41:43
What? this website? 
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:49:42
Sweet! It was actually a gift for my bro as he helped me out a heap. How are you finding the HTC one? 
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:35:59
By the way its not my site, I just used it and saw that his donation address hasn't received many bitcoin.
I just sent him .5 because it really is a very good and secure well thought out service.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:19:34
Man thanks for the great explanation! Its such a better way to go . I wonder  why is this not common practice with everything on the web. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 11:23:30
You should try to earn money in bitcoins. What are you good at? Offer your services. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:34:00
Yeah there is very little chance of it replacing anything. The important thing is competition. Otherwise its a dictatorship. We as a society hate monopolies because we know they are bad but when it comes to money we all think its totally normal and good wich of course it's not. Competition is what makes capitalism fair and work for most people. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:38:00
Yeah I agree MtGox is trying really hard and has not been hacked for a year now. The pressure that Mark guy must be under would be huge. I'm boycotting CoinLab! I mean they know that Gox has been snowed under trying defend and build infrastructure to deal with the DDOS attacks. things might take a little longer. So what coin lab decides to sue!  Bunch of wankers. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 08:07:37
Those where the days. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:59:12
Nice one mate. I tgink the best thing to do is offer your products or services for bitcoin. That way you dont need to buy them but can start trading them within the community. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:41:47
Yeah or its just a really interesting story! 
@_date: 2013-06-21 20:24:45
LOL more like you will get sweet fuck all done because you spent time sweating from the heat and bailing out your house from floods. 
Go the far north!
@_date: 2013-06-16 07:53:16
They all ready gave it to charity.
@_date: 2013-06-17 08:09:21
Hmmmm interesting move but I don't think it's A good one. As it's screaming in the faces of the legacy systems BTC will replace. BTC is a great fighter but she is young and not yet mature enough to take on the heavy weights in the ring. I would of let her train a bit longer before taunting the opponent. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 12:46:23
I also got my HTC one from them. They are really good. They also answered me really fast and the guy that runs it lives near me and deliverd it personally because it was a Sunday. LOL how cool is that. 
Anyway got my thumbs up. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:39:14
Wow. Do you have a raw vegan restaurant?
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:15:16
screw coin lab. what where they bringing to the table anyway? Oooh woopdy doo they would make a deal with an american bank
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:56:38
I would love it if someone could do a video explaining open transactions.
@_date: 2013-06-08 08:42:54
Yes one country can but then if other countries don't then they will have a trade advantage. Its all about getting as many people as possible to accept crypto now. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 23:18:04

Really cool stuff is starting to happen. Watching btc for 3 years now and finally people are getting it. I personally know of 5 amaizing bitcoin and litecoin projects that are in the pipeline. Let the free market show how cool it is when its left to its own devices.
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:27:52
Cool thanks. :-) 
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:54:28
Some how I missed the original post. I would love to be part of the next one. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:35:47
Yeah. I just hate when private banks start telling all my details to the state. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 09:06:24
Oh yeah I realised that as soon as I posted. Should send a press release now to Forbes and nytimes
@_date: 2013-06-05 08:38:07
Yes it Stops people buying utter crap. I research every thing before I buy somthing with BTC as the product has got to be good enough for me to part with my hard earned BTC. 
This is why greenies should jump on board the BTC band wagon. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:28:57
Thanks everyone, I ended up partitioning my drive and installing Ubuntu like that.
I know I prb didn't need to be this secure but wanted to se how it all works. 
I think more important than hardware wallets which could fail having offline wallet printers would sell well. But then if you are just going to print 1 or 2 why would you buy that. Anyway got it done and am super happy :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:27:13

Nice one man. Thanks for ppsting
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:06:19
Sure thing. What email address?
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:06:37
Yeah but that will change as people do deals with rougher companies to accept this. 
Or browser plugins that can see .Bit 
@_date: 2013-04-30 09:02:28
Its about real time pricing but yeah buying futures in corn or honey or oil or rice or anything else for that matter is very hard at the moment. Once bitcoin finds its fair value probably in 2-3 years we will see futures arise.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:39:35
Yeah I agree. I but when you have a look at the volume of people wanting to sell it definatly outways the buyers in the short term. It does look very bearish, HOLD SPARTONS! LOL but if you where a good trader I guess you could trade this.
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:58:54
Yeah man it's awesome here in Berlin. More and more places accept btc.
ICK BIN EIN BITCOINER!

I think eventually they wont tax your income because that will be to hard but they will use the postal service to tax deliveries and gst or vat to tax your consumption. Tax, once again distorting freemarks
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:14:31
I like litecoin because its the oldest most mature alt coin it was one of the first.

Just wandering is it the same with blockchain.info?
@_date: 2013-06-16 08:05:00

@_date: 2013-05-03 17:43:28
Wow! Really?
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:37:45
It would never replace 100%! maybe .1 or .2 at most 1% 
The point of crypto is to compete not to become a monopoly on purchasing power.  
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:24:10
*With the money transfers between exchanges being faster means less opportunity for arbitrage. I doubt Bitcoin - alt-coin exchange volume would be big enough to warrant much attention, making it pretty useless for arbitrage.
Yeah less arb is better as it evens out the price across exchanges. Thats my point.
*Only if the volume was important enough and the alt-coin's price was nor essentially pegged against Bitcoin. Most likely it would end up being in a close relation to one another due to the high arbitrage, making it useless still.
Yeah well in the recent bubble pop we saw litecoin pretty much pegged to bitcoin. it was very interesting.
I don't agree that it would be useless, I think you are missing my point.
*Start your own or promote those that do, don't just beg people to acknowledge your beliefs.
I am, I have 2 projects on the go at the moment
And I'm not begging anyone. I'm simply putting my opinion out there :)
 
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:29:39
Perfect man! And be sure to send press release out to the media 2 weeks before the event and ring the press to see if they got the press release.

Here is what I wrote to them at 
Hi there,
I love themeforest.net its really great but....
 
We are living in 2013 where there is now cash for the internet called bitcoin.
When are we going to be able to buy themes with crypto currencies like bitcoin?
And when are we able to get paid in bitcoin?
I would love to have the choice to offer themes I create up for bitcoin and litecoin and then get paid in them.
crypto currencies have almost 0% fees and are instant. That means you and the contributors get more profit.
Also it means that people can buy or create themes that live in countries banned by Paypal and credit card companies because of high charge back fraud. With Bitcoin you can not have fraud due to the irreversibility of this currency.
I am sick of credit cards and paypal!
Please get with the times and gain more profits for your selves and contributors.
Kindest regards

Has the electrum and bitcoin-qt client been translated into madarin ?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:32:44
Yeah the whole thing seems really suspect almost like there is coercion involved to force Mtgox into a corner. but not sure.
I meen such a one sided contract and then suing them so quickly even though they know Mtgox has been dealing with massive infrastructure issues. I can understand them doing things slowly because you cant just throw 100 devs at the issue because 1 dev could hack the system and make of with a massive amount of coins. 
So they are being careful and doing things slowly but carefully. For Coinlab to know all this and still sue them for being 1 month late is really suspect. Almost like they are to close to the banks.....
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:47:06
It would be great to incorporate the Mutually assured destruction system somehow. 
But instead of destruction both parties could decide who get the coins if the deal falls through. So a charity or something.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:26:29
Hate to be negative but you guys are to pricey for me. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:51:44
There is nothing wrong with saving. Especially during a price discovery phase of bitcoin. People eventually spend savings.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:37:54
Well i tried it again and now it works. I already purchased the HTC one from you guys so Am totally excited to have it arrive.
If you want to try to replicate the error
I was using a mac 10.8.3 with google chrome 26.0.1410.65
I don't want to place another order incase it works.
