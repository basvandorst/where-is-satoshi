That's not the point I'm making and you know it.  And I also did not imply it was revolutionary.  I'm talking about how big names and websites will incite a rally or dip so they can profit from/fade the other side, I'm not just talking about basic supply/demand reactions to price in real time. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:56:23
That's how this whole scheme works.  A few people get together and start saying "buy! buy! buy!" so people buy and they gain a few ticks on their trades, then they sell and price drops.  
edit:  Oh come on, that's exactly how most markets work nowadays.  Price is hyped up and then the big players dump and move price.  This is fundamental.

Yeah it's not really useful to me.  I'd rather trade Forex.  Maybe when it matures a bit and more local stores accept it? But then how is it worth the hassle for small transactions?  I mean other than putting a big chunk of your wealth into it to protect against inflation, etc, but the price is still volatile enough to make that point invalid. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:28:50
For sure, I totally get that.  When it happens let me know. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:48:35
hah, comparing bitcoin to myspace is actually prety fair. a "facebook" coin will come along and take over as technology matures.

I had the same thought, how are they "taking on" bitcoin here?  They are assessing it, if anything. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:30:34
Really?  How close to the brink has it been?

exaaactly.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:05:07
Yeah well, it kind of has been a pump and dump for many people.  Naturally people who want to pump and dump will call everyone an idiot who points out that it's been used as a pump in dump so they can continue to use it as a pump and dump.  Ya get what I'm sayin?  
In other words, people who are long any significant amount of bitcoin are going to call it the savior of humanity and claim there's NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, EVER.

"The Myspace of cryptocurrencies"
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:28:39
you could be right. 2 months ago I was EAGERLY waiting for a good buy point if it dropped below 750. you see I watched it go from 70 to 140 to 250, down a bit then up to 1k.  now its at 600 and I cant be arsed.  Its the first of its kind, I have a feeling somehing will happen to the encryption instantly rendering it all worthless. If a digital coin does become used worldwide for a long time, chances are it wont be the prototype version.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:37:49
I agree. It could very go back up to a grand, but we will probably see it dive first.  Then a huge buying frenzy by people whi have been watching all along but have never owned a coin. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:36:17
good point
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:11:34
But the demand and hence value does come from needing USD to buy oil.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:19:33
Some day a hole will be found, instantly making it all worthless. Its like they say in security.... nothing is hackproof, ever. Period. The hole will be found some day.

Yes but that would be worded "Goldman Sachs' take on Bitcoin". At least it would be closer.

Dumbass.

or maybe it makes perfect sense to pretend to do these things, if the coins cannot be traced to him, to do anything else would be to admit guilt and then his ass would be found at the bottom of the pacific no matter how rich he might be.  it seems to me what he is doing is the perfect course if action if he did steal the coins.
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:10:10
I feel that is a possibility as well.
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:08:55
It's pretty much confirmed that the USD will stop being the world's reserve currency, probably within the next 5-10 years.  So yeah, once that happens...
  - looks like my guess of 5-10 years was somewhat accurate.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:22:15
What about cashing out slowly over time.. say a few million USD worth every 6-12 months?  After making his spot in history.. I can see someone being satisfied with that, never having to lift a finger in effort ever again.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:20:59
Uh yea its probably not that simple and would be admitting guilt. If he could come out without being found guilty, and glean a few million here and there, while not having to live on a hidden island,no matter what kind of luxuries he could afford...it would probably be a better situation. And besides, if he has an IQ of 190, he's not going to do something so obvious that random internet people can easily predict it.
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:01:49
Hope? Yes most definitely.  Illusory...?  Possibly, since this is all so new, a more secure coin may come along to replace it. He makes some good points. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:37:08
Actually, many 1st generation email providers *have* run their course and have been replaced by something better (security/features/underlying architecture).
He didn't say digital currency has run its course, just bitcoin. So the comparison you're making isnt valid.  But I understand you have an investment to protect.

Wait are you saying there's an official 51% day to remind people to avoid letting one pool/person get to 51% ownership? 
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:12:27
I mean they probably have an actual internet kill switch, for times of war or civil unrest.  I mean look at what happens in Egypt because people could communicate on social media an organize.. they ousted their government because of the power of the internet.  Our governments are very aware of this possibility.  So lets say a digital currency totally screws the Forex and Equity markets, causing the economy to implode... causing civil unrest, etc, at that point the gov would probably kill or highly restrict internet access to "protect us".   Rendering bitcoin useless.   We have to depend on the fact that our governments ALLOW us to have internet.  They ultimately have the final say whether we use digital currencies or not, unless someone develops a decentralized and redundant internet.

@_date: 2014-03-21 04:15:18
really? because they own bitcoins which have no value other than the demand for them,so any negative comments are a threat to their investment. its all based on sentiment so it needs to be hyped up to succeed.   which is why you will always see people saying its stable/safe/long term even if it fell to $5 per coin. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:20:17
the state provides nothing. you're still brainwashed from childhood.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:09:12
It hasn't been lost.  If anything, this reinforced trust long term since it raises standards for exchanges. People now debate which exchanges are the most secure/safe, so it has become a selling point.  The fact that it's holding over $500 dollars despite the Gox event is proof of this.  
@_date: 2014-07-21 12:03:59
its always coming.  fuck off no I wont buy bitcoin in order to make your bitcoins worth more.

I understand what hashing is and how its a one way thing due to computational difficulty. Obviously the only way to get around that is to buy a quantum computer. But theres always a backdoor/crack in the wall somewhere.

you cant argue opinions? some opinions have weight based on observation, hence why you bought the coins in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:49:50
Um... that's all the USD is now, a confidence game.  And the world is losing confidence pretty fast.    Why do you think the US is so involved in countries that are trying to adopt a different medium of exchange for oil?   Saddam was trying to do the same...  then we invaded Iraq.  
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:19:11
Exactly - how can a 51% attack destroy bitcoin.   (note the rhetorical nature of the statement, implying a 51% attack cannot destroy bitcoin).  Glad the op could work that out for himself in the same post.

The name. I doubt you'd get Apple to go "oh ok lets switch to a coin no ones heard of".  It'll make it seem too volitile. People need to feel that its stable. Even the ones that have adopted bitcoin are still feelin as if theyre taking a big enough risk as it is.

...which is pretty damn relevant, really.  How can bitcoin really take off if it's not as simple to use as other methods?  I am pretty tech savvy and still don't' know how to setup a bitcoin wallet, and don't really feel the need to.  I know it's not *that* difficult and within my abilities, but I can't be arsed because it will take some time and reading and several steps to setup and for what?  So how is your average grandma going to fare?
