I use, and recommend, Blockfolio (Android app). It keeps of every purchase including details such as the spot price at the time of purchase, any fees associated with the purchase, which exchange I used, and custom notes. It then automatically shows the average buying price, profits, etc.

You have probably heard someone say that you should not take out a loan on a speculative investment, particularly one as volatile as cryptocurrency, but oh well. Best of luck to you. When you are rich, I will definitely give you some props for taking some risk. Best of luck to you!

Awesome shirt. I wear mine all of the time. I've only had three different people ask me what it means. I was hoping to get more attention. Give it time.
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:14:07
You are welcome. It is fun, albeit more so when your investment is increasing in value. Best wishes and ask questions so you can learn. All indications are that cryptocurrency will be a part of our future and we are definitely in its infancy.
DCA = Dollar Cost Averaging (Look it up and do it)

Wow, I'd just like to comment upon your receptiveness and mature responses to peoples' feedback. I would not have expected that given this is  a forum on the Internet. I can't offer advice better than what many others in here have already said but please continue what you are doing. Acknowledge your mistake, learn from it, and you will be stronger for it. I'm a big fan of Dave Ramsey who has gone broke multiple times, learned from those struggles and is now a very wealthy and successful financial adviser. You truly have my best wishes.

This answer!
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:36:10
As many people have suggested, educate yourself. However, if you can risk $20, or whatever you are comfortable losing, get some Bitcoin and it will inspire you to learn more than if you didn't have any "skin in the game." Furthermore, use that as the start of your dollar-cost-averaging. Some people are telling you that it is a good time to buy and others are saying that now is not a good time to buy. Nobody *knows*. The best way to spread any potential losses or gains is to make a number of small purchases at various price points rather than waiting for "the right time". Just my humble opinion.

"It's not fair"? What kind of logic is that for a rational adult with regards to investing? Can I argue that it is not fair I didn't get to buy Microsoft shares at $1.00? It isn't a matter of fairness. You are clearly anti-bitcoin. You asked a question and then argue each point with ignorance. Save your allowance money and find a different investment. Be sure to watch the value of cryptocurrencies in the future so you can become even more sour as you remain stubbornly ignorant.

Perhaps a change to further divide Bitcoin into sub-satoshis via a protocol or wallet implementation, maybe another coin gets used for micropayments (there is evidence of this already), or... my favorite prediction is that the dollar becomes so invaluable that further dividing it is pointless.

@_date: 2019-06-27 15:05:12
You are both hilarious and spot-on!
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:55:35
Agreed! I remember DCA-ing at $18,500 somehow wishing it would drop below $10K so I could load up.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:38:57
Thank you. My average net cost is a bit above that. I did pretty well around February of this year buying quite a bit more than usual but was still doing DCA in December of 2017 of a few hundred dollars every other week so that skews my numbers unfavorably. On the other hand, early purchases (~2013) help.
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:49:23
I hope that your score is hidden because it is being up-voted so rapidly. Even a tiny bit of research will lead one in the right direction. Asking a more pointed question to a more narrow audience (programmers and such) will yield some really good information. Posting a broad question for any random respondent to opine only leaves evidence of one's lack of effort when social media is scoured during the recruitment process by a potential employer.
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:46:00
That is an interesting question. I'd be curious if (s)he or anyone would divulge that information. Given that it took a year to acquire, (s)he probably DCA'd the acquisition. There were some really good and some less-than-ideal times to buy when compared to today's price. I love tracking my purchase prices so I can deduce the total price paid for various cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:03:32
I'm OK with that! I will just deviate from my DCA and buy a lot more then! Hahahaha.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:39:59
Hahahah did you buy this morning as part of your routine DCA or are you saying you exceeded your standard DCA?
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:47:18
So you are saying that the original 50BTC is unspendable but the ~16 additional coins sent to it are spendable? That would make complete sense. Thank you for the clarification!

@_date: 2019-06-26 19:46:12
There are a lot of factors in which coin you want to hold. One of the many factors to consider during this short-term you seem to be referencing is percentage of return. For example, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) is up +20% and Ethereum is up +13%. If your in for a thousand dollars, which of those two coins would net you the greatest return? There are many other things to consider such as long-term gains/losses, volatility, etc. For example, even though BTC is up by a greater percentage than BCH today, I'm buying some more BCH for a number of reasons.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:37:40
Long time investor here (2013). My goal is based upon time. It could hit $100K in a month and I wouldn't pull a satoshi. When I am close to early retirement in a few years, I will evaluate the market and decide when to start periodic withdrawals. It has been way up and way down since I started and expect more movement. I don't need the money now so it sits like my other investments, all of which I still dollar-cost-average.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:14:29
Yes, this! DCA FTW. Fortunately my average is even less than that. Even less than the current price and I still made my regular purchase at $18,500. Average your costs out my friends. It works out in the long run.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:35:16

@_date: 2019-12-20 15:30:30
Nope, we are certain that it can't be spent. It is hard-coded as such and it has been argued whether or not this is even a "bug". Even though the address [1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa]( contained 50BTC (to which people have added, for some reason, \~16BTC), it is unspendable. All nodes would reject this block unless someone made the proper change to the code, reinitialized the database containing blocks (genesis block to the current block), and got a sufficient number of other nodes to do the same.

Heh right? I have deviated from my DCA a bit when the price is relatively low. The lower it falls the more I buy.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:40:21
Heh, right? It is funny how I deviate from DCA when the price drops. I'm not very diligent about DCA'ing except when the price is relatively high. Otherwise, every drop is a buy opportunity.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:13:21
DCA - absolutely! I bought at 11K. I even made my usual $100 purchase at $18,500. Granted it appears to suck when the price is what it is now, but I didn't sell and continue to DCA to this day. My average cost is very very low and I intend to HODL for a long time. It is somewhat easy to identify the newcomers.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:26:14

@_date: 2019-12-05 13:49:37
Is your question supposed to mean "How did you acquire one whole bitcoin"? Since OP mentioned that it took a year, I'm guessing that it was multiple fractional purchases. Hopefully they were 12 of them (for example) so he could dollar-cost-average the buy. Perhaps he bought most of it on December 15th of 2018 when it was about $3,200 USD each! &lt;shrug&gt;
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:32:44
I strongly agree with your statement. Lots of people here are advising to stay away from alt-coins. You make some really good points. It is a higher-risk/higher-reward way to get familiar with the whole ecosystem. Alt-coins (at least for now) tend to follow the trends of Bitcoin, so a 20% increase in value of your $100 in Bitcoin should roughly translate to the same dollar amount if that same amount is invested in an alt-coin. You can own one Bitcoin or 100 alt-coins but a 20% gain on your investment is 20%.
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:16:42
Terrific explanation! Thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:11:32

@_date: 2019-12-05 14:58:39
Very nice. I too have spent some of my earnings (winnings? =:-)). At lunch a co-worker asked about me taking some money out and I said that, at this point, it is a no-lose situation. I have taken so much more out than I have put in, if it drops to $0.00 USD, I'm money ahead. It hurts to spend it once in a while but it is important that I realize some of the rewards and continue to DCA. Feels counter intuitive sometimes though.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:27:51
Oh yeah, I was dollar-cost-averaging and remember spending $100 USD when Bitcoin was at $18,500. When it dropped, it was so hard to see but I knew that it was only a percentage of $100 that I lost... not a whole Bitcoin and not my entire investment. I had purchased a lot of Bitcoin at much much less than that in the years before. Dollar-Cost-Average my man.

I hope my drug dealer is thinking this far ahead!

Thank you for the perspective. This should be alarming news to anyone who understands macro economics and should be an impetus to learn about macro economics right f'n now if they don't.

If I may elaborate, as I'm sure you know, the Federal Reserve is a private entity. But I'm sure we can agree that some very powerful people, including ~~gangsters~~ banksters have quite the influence.
"[Although an instrument of the US Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.]( I encourage everyone to do a little research on this entity. It, and its behavior lately should alarm you.

Good quote by a great man. Too bad Forbes jams it into one's face when following a link to their site.

That is not true. Shut up.

Hopefully you are telling them this in a nice house with enough cryptocurrency to pay for their college and perhaps first cars.

That's excellent. I just ordered one. Thank you!

No reason whatsoever to be suspicious.

Anyone question the "19 million Bitcoin known to be used" when 2.8-3.8 million are supposedly lost forever?

Fine article with some good points. I just can't get over the use of "Loosing" instead of "Losing". That is some elementary level spelling errors. [Medium.com]( needs to get it together.

Upvoted you out of confusion of what you said.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:39:57
I see. Thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:02:31
Absolutely! Well said and I couldn't agree more. I hope that your score is hidden because of the massive influx of upvotes.

Man, now I don't know what to do!
