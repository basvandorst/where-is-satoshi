I mean, this is a legitimate strategy if you are a country planning on getting your leg in the door. 
1. Put a ban on crypto
2. Spend a few months loading up your bags
3. Lift ban after a huge price run
4. Dump bags on the people with FOMO
It’s a tested and vetted strategy. Just ask China.

GDAX.  I have been trying it for the past several months and I think it's great.  People may talk crap because it is Coinbase, but I have only had one minor issue with Coinbase in 3 years of doing business with them and it was resolved relatively quickly by their support staff.
There are no maker fees so you could put your BTC on the order books and get 100% of their market value.

This is a PSA opportunity: don't store your coins on an exchange. Just don't. Do yourself a favor and get a hardware wallet. I understand that traders will always have some coins tied up on the order books, but if you store all of your coins on an exchange, they are not your coins.

Because the ETF approval is already somewhat priced in by speculators and if it is not approved, those speculators will dump their BTC.  It has nothing to do with the ACTUAL value of BTC, rather, it is all about the PERCEIVED value.

This is most likely professional traders trying to trigger as many stops as they can to spike the price.  Tons of people are gambling on the SEC decision and there are stops set up on both sides of the order books to hedge against losses or to snap up potential profits.  If they can buy/sell enough to trigger those stops, they can profit on the volatility.

To add a bit more to point  if you want a great way to securely store your coins, look into getting a Ledger Nano S or some other hardware wallet.  They are awesome because they secure your private keys offline and can be used for storing other coins as well, not just BTC.

I also use coinbase. Never had an issue with them.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:15:33
The private keys on your Ledger Nano S are secured and can only be accessed with the correct pin when you plug it in.  The only chance that your coins could be stolen is if your Ledger is plugged in and your computer has a trojan or something that allows an attacker to take control of your machine and send the coins manually, which isn't really a worry if you don't leave it plugged in all the time.
Also, it does not need to be plugged in to receive coins, only to send.

If the bank controls the key to a BTC address then that BTC doesn't really belong to the "account holder" anyway. The entire point of Bitcoin is to allow the individual to have total control of their own wealth.  I can see banks maybe incentivizing customers by paying out interest in BTC like they do on savings, but rates are terrible anyway in the US. We trust banks with fiat because our options are limited and the funds are insured.  But why would anyone trust a bank with their BTC?

If you're looking to swing trade and take advantage of short-term opportunities presented by the market, just keep like 10% of your holdings on the exchange and keep the other 90% in cold-storage.

Well oversight isn't far from coming.  Look at the investigations into the ICO scams that are still ongoing.  They plan to hold people accountable and I think anyone running a serious exchange that does not think they can pass an audit by now are in for a serious surprise.  I think a lot of exchanges have gotten their shit together in terms of cracking down on stuff like fake volume and other kinds of manipulation.  Take a look at the volume drop off for Ethereum and other coins on Poloniex seemingly overnight at the beginning of March 2018:
If you look at other exchanges you will see a similar trend.  This is immediately following an announcement on 2/28 that the SEC was launching a probe into Crypto exchanges and businesses:

The Venezuelans would like to have a word with you:
Sorry you bought the top, but the use cases for Bitcoin and other cryptos are very real and average people that are adversely impacted by currency controls and hyperinflation are slowly starting to realize that.  Cryptos are not a get rich quick scheme, and market manipulators will always take advantage of those that believe it is.

Maybe it's a good thing that the hype is over so that the space can grow organically.  A lot of people felt the same way about the internet and using e-mail when it first started to become mainstream and now it is pervasive throughout society.  Just as communication has gone paperless, so will transacting with people.  Being able to do business across borders without the need for financial intermediaries is a huge deal.  Maybe YOU don't give a crap about it anymore, but it doesn't change the fact that there is value in it for hundreds of thousands of users today.

There is a whole group of people and businesses dedicated to identifying illegal transactions on the blockchain and it has become much more difficult to get away with doing that kind of business in large volume.

A trader.  To take advantage of drastic price moves in smaller windows of time, a trader must keep at least some of their coins on an exchange.  Otherwise, they would need to constantly be transferring from their wallet to the exchange which can take between a few minutes to an hour depending on the volume of transfers occurring, thus causing them to lose the advantage of timing on these kinds of trades.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:31:26
Limit orders do not carry a fee.  Market orders do. The difference is with a limit order you are putting a buy or sell on the books and have to wait for your order to be filled. With a market order, you are taking someones offer off the books by either buying their sell order or selling to their buy order.  This is described as being a market maker or taker.

The IRS has already tried to probe Coinbase for user data.  They were unsuccessful so far, but that's not to say that the IRS is throwing in the towel.  The government wants their taxes paid, and they will be relentless in that pursuit.

No matter what the outcome is, if you earned capital gains selling BTC on Coinbase you need to report it to the IRS when you file your taxes.  Better to be safe than sorry. Uncle Sam always gets their money one way or another.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:43:35
My understanding is that it is taxed similar to how gains on stocks are taxed.  If you buy and hold BTC, you are not taxed until you sell it.  The rate at which you are taxed will depend on how long you held for.  If it was under a year then you will be subject to a higher tax rate.
There are some other situations that you will need to report as well, like if you use the BTC to make a purchase, and the BTC was worth more than you paid for it originally, it is a taxable event.  
Hopefully this site can answer a lot of your questions:

That's like saying "You don't NEED to go the speed limit because the police don't have the resources to catch everyone speeding.  There is a small chance of getting caught."  Sure, people will speed anyway, but getting caught means fines and points that no one wants to be hit with.  The idea is the same for taxes, except the penalties are orders of magnitude worse than getting a speeding ticket.

I am bullish on cryptos in general. Bitcoin being the “gold standard” of crypto will not be going away anytime soon. It is still fun to trade on the short term highs and lows though, with the goal of increasing crypto holdings for the long term.

BTC and ETH can co-exist and serve different functions.  One is a cryptocurrency and the other is a crypto-commodity because it is consumable.  They both have their functions - one as a store of value and the other to execute decentralized code.
I like to think of the two like gold and oil.  It would be silly for investors in the traditional markets to dump all of their oil stocks for gold and vice versa. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:11:59
Yes, that is right - I like to play the market with a small portion (10-20%) of my holdings. The rest is held long term. These swing trades can last from a day to possibly weeks depending on how volatile the market is. The key is to set your price targets and stick to them, don’t be emotional. And set tight stops (5-10%) to conserve your capital if the market moves in the opposite direction that you were hoping for.
I am not sure what you mean by giving up anonymity. No one knows who is buying and selling on the exchanges except for the exchanges themselves. As long as you are using a  major exchange, you can assume a reasonable level of security, but as long as you are trusting a 3rd party, your assets are never 100% secure.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:11:47
Everyone has different strategies.  Some people profit most from short term volatility.  Others have a buy and hold strategy.  Cryptos are great for swing trading IMO.  Keep some BTC and alts for holding and have a small percentage of that used for swing trades.

You bought too early.  The dip is not here yet.  25% pullback would be more of a dip.  You actually bought closer to a top.

Well it corrected about 40% back in late May.  Another 40% correction at this point would peg it at around $225 which may be a good point to scoop it up.
