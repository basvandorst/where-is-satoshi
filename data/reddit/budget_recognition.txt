Yeah, this is where I guess I don't quite follow the logic. I feel just like how multiple countries produce different fiats, any number of entities could produce any number of coins, none of which is inherently more 'real' or 'foolproof' than the other.

But in this example, isn’t the dollar’s relative strength based at least in part on the US’s strength of economy compared to Zimbabwe’s weakness?

Thank you so much! This really helped me! I didn't realize this aspect of BTC

I think this is where my confusion stems from though. The fact that fake rolexes don't devalue real ones is not the same as the fact that having more than one watch producer does devalue the total number of watches. Someone may value a rolex more, but theres plenty of people to whom a watch is a watch is a watch, and to those people a rolex isn't of much value. I guess what I'm getting at is if what draws you to BTC is its decentralized nature, anonymity, etc, and there are other coins that do this, why is Bitcoin the gold standard?

I suppose not, but I would probably accept a Euro.

Thank you for clarifying. I think its the *for now* part that gets me. I feel like you could say similar things about any currency, like USD. I think I could understand if people had more of a 'wait and see' attitude about BTC, but I feel like a lot of people emphasize something really transcendent and absolutely unmatchable about bitcoin that makes it a silver bullet.
