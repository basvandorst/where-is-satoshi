Sounds like the basis for a stable economy to me. :-)

Here’s how I see the value of Lightning Network beyond that of a simplistic two participant channel. As the LN expands beyond 2 participants, the LN becomes exponentially more useful.
Think of a 3 party of economically stable actors:
1. Power Company opens payment channel to pay Engineer for work.
2. Engineer opens payment channel with Landscaper to cut lawn.
3. Landscaper opens payment channel with Power Company to pay Power bill.
As long as each participant keeps each channel open, payments can circulate indefinitely until one needs to close the channel and reconcile payments on chain

Be me: age 34
Rollover IRA and 401k 
- Weighted Net Worth - 80%/20% in each. 
- High risk Small Cap stocks in IRA / Mutual Funds in 401k. 
Find Bitcoin. 
Liquidate IRA, retain estimated tax/penalties in cash. 
- Expect a bill in the Spring!
Buy Bitcoin ASAP!
NPV of investment decision break even after 1.5months.
Keep contributing to 401k with employer match.
HODL and buy more for 3 years minimum for ALL UPSIDE.
And I agree, I see Bitcoin being the closest thing to a risk free asset.  With a hardware wallet, I KNOW I own X amount of BTC today (relative to 21M...), and next year I KNOW have X amount of BTC today, (relative to the same 21M...).  Yes, I understand BTC is inflating (albeit at a diminishing rate).  It's that nature of BTC being a digitally optimal store of value that draws me into eliminating as much USD from my net worth as possible.

Sounds ultra bullish for McAfee and MGTI...

I give it away to my hair dresser as a tip with the hope someday it will let her retire in comfort. :-)
