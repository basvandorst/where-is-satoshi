Can someone explain to me how LN will be implemented on a scale that can used by the general public? Will new wallets have to be created or will it be up to the individual wallets and exchanges to choose to use LN once people start demanding it? Or as a user will I have to download an LN app and run that concurrently alongside my wallet and exchange apps?
Basically how will mass adoption be encouraged and fostered?

I had the exact same problem. Not that I'm excusing them but I believe it's just down to the MASSIVE volume of new users. Is this the same for every exchange? Their CS computers must be smoking 24/7

I have had great experiences with them so far. I only had 1 hiccup, and after that it was fine. They only trade 2 cryptocurrencies for now but I'm fine with that. They won't be as badly flooded with new users like binance or bitfinex.
CS is slow but it gets round to you eventually.

Yea so they say. My bank has confirmed it on my end and I have the proof which I shared with Gemini but I would like to know if they got it on their end or if there is any problem. This isn't the first time I've transferred to them and at worst it's taken only 2 days so I don't know why this one is an issue.

Makes sense though for the promotional piece. Since it's going to be all over cameras and social media, better to use a dud account rather than something legit that could end up being passed around

Thanks, but that issue was resolved. His point is that Bitcoin is a share, not a currency.

Gemini fees are very low in comparison. I use them because in my country, ATMs charge 10% + arbitrage. At the time of writing this BTC is $8140, the ATM is probably closer to 10k. 
Remember, an ATM is for convenience, not trading. If you need BTC urgently, maybe for a street purchase or to get someone started it could do in a pinch  but you're paying for electricity, wages, rent etc on top of your crypto.

I may do this if it comes to it.

I didn't come across like that at all, I'm just doing that for you guys ahaha. We have good, rational discussions but this time he shut this down quicker than a spark on a hay stack. What I wrote in the post is all that was said.
