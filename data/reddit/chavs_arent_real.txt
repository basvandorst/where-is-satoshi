How many times this gonna happen before you guys stop using Coinbase (and Poloniex)? I'm sure they are fine exchanges but they can't handle the current volume. I'd use something else until they get their shit together.

Try Bitsquare.io (a real p2p exchange). Using a centralized exchange just weakens the point of using a decentralized currency.

Verification was taking so long I ended up doing this. Got my BTC. Now trading on crypto-only exchange. Still waiting for verification on the others.

You could say this about literally any bitcoin for any reason. Then you are going off on pure speculation about why you think these particular BTC are more likely to be illegal.


Do you understand how dangerous this line of thinking is? "Oh you were charged with possession of marijuana? Well you're a criminal so you're probably using laundered money to pay your lawyers." "Oh you need a lawyer to contest a speeding ticket? Well you can't use your crypto to pay for that either." This is wrong on so many levels. THIS is why we need anonymous currency.
This is also why you should not do business with any exchange that is so scared about covering their own asses that they won't perform completely legitimate transactions for fear of potential retalation from the government that has never happened. Crypto exchanges should be staunch defenders of the freedom of the people to use and trade cryptocurrency. Instead too many of them have gone the central bank route of becoming money-grubbing scum just protecting their own profits.

Hi, Monero shill here. I think Monero is a superior store of value, and that other features such as smart contracts are overrated at this point in time. Care to debate?

But now they are signaling Segwit2x? Is that the same/better as UASF or is there some reason that what the 80% fat cat miners are signaling now is bad?
edit: Can you please break down each possible outcome on Aug 1 and how they affect bitcoin and whether you think each is a good or bad thing. Because I'm confused what's even going on right now.

I don't disagree with your right to complain, but I prefer to speak with my wallet.
