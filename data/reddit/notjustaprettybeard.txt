Bitcoin's security model relies on it being expensive, in terms of energy, to attack. This means it must be expensive in terms of energy full stop. Even proof of stake, if it works, is expensive to secure, except in that case it is the opportunity cost of not using the coins you're staking with for some different economic end. 
Secure trustlessness cannot be achieved for free. The position that Bitcoin is great, but we should be trying to make it cost less, is not a coherent one.

Hmm, this is quite a slippery topic. When you say addresses can be increased, do you mean that they can be of arbitrary length? I thought the number of addresses was unfeasibly large but fixed? Also it was my understanding that a coin couldn't be divided below one satoshi. Both of these are sized so that in the real world we won't run into problems in the lifetime of planet Earth, but that's not infinite.

Breaking even is still a long way from making a viable power plant. By then it might be too late, we've got fifty years of fossil fuels left at best and we can't afford to even burn all of them if we like living on a planet that isn't trying to kill us. 
Even looking past that, the dense plasma focus approach has several advantages over big projects like ITER, not least because its small size and comparative ease to construct would favour a more robust, decentralized grid, an idea I'm sure bitcoiners can get behind.

I've been following these guys with interest. I've already donated some dollars but now I'm going to donate some bitcoin too. Even if there's a one percent chance they can pull it off then it's basically problem solved and all we need to do is decide how best to build utopia (and how to reverse entropy of course, but we can hold off on that one for a while).

Economists are nothing like mathematicians. There's a bit of maths in econometrics but from what I can see even they're a bit dubious about the validity of their models. I can't speak for philosophers though.

Not Bitcoin related but I strongly recommend going up Petrin Hill Observation Tower in the evening. The observatory is next door which is worth a look too.

The fundamental issue of scaling versus security affects all alts as well. It's always going to be a trade off between one and the other in blockchain based cryptocurrency. Given security is the thing that other payment systems can't do, I don't see the wisdom in sacrificing bitcoin's for anything.

I would be interested in seeing some calculations of beta against some Chinese indices - these have more chance of turning up something non trivial given how much of bitcoin's volume originates in China. However, I still wouldn't be terribly surprised if there was still no correlation there; bitcoin is still in its infancy, no one quite knows what it is and how to treat it, and I suspect that there is a quite large subset of people involved in bitcoin trading who do not engage with the rest of the market very much.

Because even a martian could tell the difference between football and cricket - that's precisely my point. They occupy different spaces and so identities aren't really at stake. Even though you and I know bitcoin and ethereum are completely different beasts, just as Man City and Man Utd or Yorks CC and Lancs CC are, you have to be at least a bit involved in the culture to be aware of it. This is the recipe for things to get nasty.

Maybe not on the team level, but have you never heard a League fan bash Union as being the shit version? Or vice versa? I hardly move in rugby circles either but I've heard this often, and it doesn't take much searching to turn up tons of examples like [this]( I'm surprised that you've found my point controversial, it's certainly not original on my part but when I came across it a lot of things exactly like the BTC/ETH rancor began to make sense.

I actually have no idea about football, I just picked a notable sporting rivalry most people would have heard of. Any will do, because I don't believe for a second that even if the clubs were playing only in separate leagues and their performances no effect on each other, a fan of one wouldn't feel extremely smug if the other were completely buried by someone shit.

The votes are in and 52% of the populace want out. To my mild surprise, no one official seems to have even entertained the possibility of overruling them, and so it looks like spectrum is green for Brexit. 
I actually am not convinced that Brexit has much to do directly with the recent BTC price movement which fits perfectly well with how bitcoin has behaved before during bull markets. However, it will (already has) caused a great deal of financial uncertainty in the UK, Europe, and by extension the world, and if word spreads that bitcoin is a 'safe haven' asset you might expect to see some people buying it as more traditional asset classes flounder.

It's not exactly surprising when you think about it. Is Manchester City's greatest rival a shove ha'penny team from Cambodia? No, it's Manchester United, despite the fact that fans of either have clearly shown their enthusiasm for football teams from the Greater Manchester area. The strongest enmities spring up between camps that are almost indistinguishable to the casual observer, and possibly directly because of this. If an outsider can't tell the differences between two groups, then you need to broadcast your tribal affiliations extra loud so there's no chance you can be mistaken for one of 'them'.

Because unless mining Bitcoin has a real cost associated with it the consensus system won't work - attacks on the network would be too easy to perform.
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:12:35
And so large blocks won't diminish the security of the network? What about propagation problems due to bandwidth etc?

There's a big difference between 8mb blocks and the kind of blocksize that could cope with every fridge in the world ordering more milk and eggs when supplies are low and paying for it on the blockchain. Maybe this is not what 21 Inc are actually planning but I've seen plenty of people talk about this in the context of the internet of things so I don't think it's unreasonable to consider whether the system could function in more extreme circumstances. 
For the record, I'm not trying to make arguments for 1MB blocks although I suppose I can see why you might have thought I was. I am trying to understand exactly what 21 Inc are up to and why it matters, as it is probably important and seems nontrivial enough that there aren't really convenient summaries that are any use. In particular I was wondering about how it might play with the lightning network (something else I don't fully understand but seems important and will probably happen).  
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:14:13
This makes more sense, do you have a link handy where I can read up about what exactly it is they're doing?
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:32:31
Question: is 21 Inc gambling on the blocksize increasing substantially? A microtransaction, internet of things type deal they seem to be keen to usher seems like it will flood the blockchain with too many transactions by several orders of magnitude, as things stand. If the blocksize stays small, they're screwed no?
Now, it may be the case that creating millions of devices that mine is exactly the kind of infrastructure that means the blockchain could support much larger blocks without sacrificing decentralization to too great a degree. However, I'm not completely certain this will be true even in the best case scenario, and doesn't mining on these devices automatically put you in the 21 Inc pool anyway?
