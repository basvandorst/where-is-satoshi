Yeah but by the time you catch a plane back with 50 briefcases full of worthless notes that have devalued 90% during the flight, the transaction would be a net loss. ��

In hindsight, that cheeto did a pretty fine job...

Preaching to the converted haha - point i’m making is that a high percentage of people in the market would still be sitting on losses at the moment. Consider also that a lot of people also hold (even more) speculative alt-coins, some of which are still down &gt;90% from ATH.

It “works” in that you can buy and withdraw, but once you reach the limit where they enforce KYC they make you jump through so many hoops compared to other exchanges that it is just not worth it. Additionally, they had a massive data breach before where they basically lost all of customers personal details, including (apparently) scans of their KYC documentation and passport photos etc, which is obviously really, really bad!!! I would personally *never* trust them or use them ever again.

You should definitely set up 2FA for the account...  ignoring the obvious security benefits, think about it from their perspective if you log in using a VPN or something. All they’d see is someone logging into your account successfully from a different country, and would want to block the connection from withdrawing. For all they know someone from another country could have hacked your password, and then you would be blaming them and chasing them to get it back... blocking the account on their end is a smart bet if no 2FA enabled.

I wouldn’t panic just yet, give them time to sort it... been really impressed with Bitstarz and how quick/trouble free they are with their deposits and withdrawals.

Mmm they are pretty reputable, I highly doubt they are scamming you or being malicious. Maybe just hear them out and see why they have frozen it... do you have 2FA enabled?
