 bitcoin is an innovation that modernizes the current financial system and forms a new system of monetary value. Surely, bitcoin will be the next generation of money.

 The notion of Bitcoin stands in fundamental contradistinction to the idea of a centralized nation-state. So, as long as that entity exists, there's no space in it's Venn diagram for any non-state virtual currency

 Chinese government has been making moves to control the influence of bitcoin on its economy but bitcoin keep rearing on international market.

 I would imagine that all the other projects are just as centralized in their GitHub structure as bitcoin is, but I think I was trying to (unsuccessfully as it seems) to say that there are a lot of individuals that contribute ideas

 While bitcoin will definitely not go anywhere even if it becomes illegal, bitcoin being legal is still quite important. Though bitcoin can still work without their interference.

 Bitcoin continues to grow and is making adjustments to be more acceptable by many people. so with that development, its value will also continue to increase over time, and I think in the next 5 years bitcoin will be more in use more people than we imagine now.

 Can't speak to Canada. In the USA, IRS rulings are that Bitcoin mined does not become taxable 'till you either sell it for cash or spend it on "tangible property" at which point it becomes taxable at the cash value of the amount of Bitcoin you spent.

 Bitcoin is also part of the existing currency system, but only has a turn in the digital web space and is not common in everyday life. That is the variation.

 I don't think ICO'S are killing bitcoin, their is a market competition but bitcoin is on top and I think with all the emerging altcoins mostly are scam people will not be dumb enough to invest on those that are not reliable.

 I see a big problem with trust in bitcoin from people who know little about it.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:15:10
 If we, investors, will constantly support the demand for bitcoins, then gradually it will be accepted by almost all countries, I am sure. The main thing is that attention is constantly focused on it, so that the authorities understand that this currency is relevant and necessary for us.

 This gives rise to a huge amount of incorrect information that spoils the image of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:19:06
 Well, right now the ownership of Bitcoin is not 'illegal' in both countries, US and China.

 It is very important now that as many States as possible support the cryptocurrency and allow it to develop on its territory. This slows down the process of bitcoin globalization and its implementation as a currency. And the official permission of the authorities will significantly accelerate the process of cryptocurrency development.

 Nothing new .. It is obvious that decentralization is a threat to every institutions that have power,and want keep it. It will take a few years, but sooner or later people will understand what is better for them. Natural feelings and education - it is our future.

 adoption is better than regulation in case of bitcoin. Regulation follows the increase of adoption. But it is not the same if regulation increases. That's why adoption of bitcoin by the normal people is needed for the bitcoin economy.

 Many billionaires have already bought bitcoins. Other rich people are afraid to buy bitcoin at an expensive price, so as not to lose too much investment.

 I really find it hard to believe but sometimes the nuances of similarities between their comparisons and that of cryptocurrenciesif it were American special services, it is possible that the US would not be so aggressively posed to the crypto currency.

 People tend to criticize what they do not understand. It is easier for them to say that bitcoin are bad, than to understand the technology of bitcoin and the essence of block-chain technology.

 What value does Bitcoin create at that point?
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:38:53

 Bitcoin is going through developmental phase, also known as the introductory phase in the product cycle, 
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:19:01
 One of the eyed future reason if bitcoin will die or lose is that its users will be gone or it will be boycott but its users.

 I agree, many people only consider bitcoin as an asset and keep on demanding the price go up, but bitcoin never intended to become an asset
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:30:08
As adoption grows Bitcoin should outpace stocks. If adoption stops it doesn't go up in value. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:04:12
 people should put more focus to develop bitcoin into a currency and now bitcoin is through a lot of development so it can be accepted as currency
