The pizza storie is a story. Tell me which pizza place accepted the bit coins. You can't because it was sent from one forum user to another forum user.

*** at the companies that accept those gift cards.

Bitcoins are pretty much gift cards at this point and the creator already sold his gift cards for real currency. So if bitcoins fail for everybody else, the creators already became rich selling at best digital gift cards that have 0 real world worth

Oh so you can goto the movies or pay your cable bill with btcs? Its nothing like cash around town that's a known fact.

Even if he was your gay lover so what?  So by that math some people potentially earned $800,000 daily. Obviously btcs weren't  $800 each at the beginning but wow that is a lot of money 7000 btcs weekly. That's what $5,000,000 monthly. That's why asked if it was like fraud because it's weird to imagine making 60+ million a year.

Son I was right.

Bitcoins aren't for me, I like silver. But hey if you want to make the creators of bitcoin rich do it. But serious question, do you  think you'll ever be able to pay taxes with bitcoins?

How's btcs not like gift cards? Except that you can mine btcs. Neither can be used like cash. Only individual companies take btcs just like gift cards can only be spent company'

No I completely understand that id need suckers to believe my currency is real and buy it. Those suckers pay for codes on a screen with either real effort, time or cash. I wish I'd been a part of this scam at the start. Cryptocurrancy will become huge when PayPal and face monetize it.

A portion of the initial btcs mined had to be sold or used to give value to btcs as a whole? I'm guessing if this is the case wouldn't it be some of the first programmers who owned btcs to sell them?
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:55:16
Why wouldn't the creator have an advantage using the software and algorithms that they made?
@_date: 2016-05-11 19:29:35
I know the story. So which papa Johns actually processed the btcs? None. It was supposedly a p2p where one guy got pizza from hid friend for btcs. Papa Johnso doesn't except btcs.

Have you personally seen a btcs wallet with more thenews 1000 btcs?
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:29:17
At the beginning of btcs creation how many hours of mining would it take to produce one million btcs? With basic open source programsoftware and basic hardware? How long and how much would it cost to mine 1,000,000 btcs today? It might be more cost and time efficient to hire people off of linkedin and just build a new cryptocurrancy.

Isnt apple a company that creates, then builds then manufacturers a product that they sell? That's nothing like btcs.
