They are used to manipulate people to believe the price can't pass this "wall".
In example: I hold 250,000 btc. I want to sell it fast, i place a "buy wall" to buy 250,000 btc at 20% below current rate.
Then i place small (1-100btc) sell-orders at 20% above my wall.
That's what it is, its to make people think you're buying,when you're actually selling.Or the opposite.
TLDR; Buy wall = time to sell. Sell wall time to buy. It's psychology.

People used to pay to store money in Swiss Banks.
Now they pay to store their money in BTC.
I call it evolution.

I know BCH will be almost worthless in the near future but this is completely wrong. This is anti-freemarket, anti-Bitcoin, Anti-freedom. They should have credited their users the BCH, and give them their right to do what they want with it.
Yes i know that on the other hand no true bitcoiner holds any substantial BTC on a centralized exchange, and any funds held at any exchange should be written off as 100% loss the moment a person chooses to deposit to an exchange, but it's still wrong.

Or just use reverse-psychology "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry." - Satoshi Nakamoto July 29, 2010, 02:00:38 AM
That quote is what got me interested (few years late, but better than never) :)

They're "the smartest guys in the room" ;)
I agree Jihan is the least shady except for one little thing, why does he have a remote kill-switch on miners he sells ? (afraid people will accidently mine the wrong bitcoin fork ?)

the same way when you cashout from your bank account IRL. you get some bills with some numbers that can track you, you go to a merchant be it 7/11 or a casino, you receive a change, you take that change to another merchant you receive another change. Repeat as many times as possible, and boom :)

If you're asking this question, you're not ready yet. Bitcoin isn't about speculation to get more fiat, it's about having the purchasing power that it empowers you with. Being there, you'll realize there is no way back. It doesn't matter if you own 1btc or 100,000btc, you won't want to.

BCH is becoming increasingly centralized:

You do realize that all this "charade", is just so he and many other major BTC holders can sell the BCH to noobs and buy more BTC for themselves.
It's possible i'm wrong, but if i was them, i'd do exactly this, prop a fork, waste a few mill USD promoting it to oblivion (which is less than 1% of his networth anyway) and then sell this great-sounding-fork to noobs while i get more BTC. 
Many people say they manipulate the markets, i don't think they're that stupid, the noobs are the pump and they're the dump

OP's Btc starting price is wrong. Ignoring the pizza trade, bitcoin was trading for 0.005$ for a very long time, thus....
It beats S&amp;P return including dividends:
0.005 to 3850 = 76,999,900%

Bitcoin was created because history proved for thousands of years that banks and governments can't be trusted. And you're asking why it's better than governments / banks ? Short answer because it's rules can't be changed (a bank can put your life-savings into a risky bet ie: Mortgage-backed-securities. And your government can decide to print an infinite amount of money at any time, maybe to save your bank that gambled your life-savings). The only way to "change the rules of bitcoin" (ie change the rate of inflation) is to convince at least 51% of the bitcoin miners that this is a good idea (due to greed, they're not going to devalue the currency, because they have much more to gain by keeping the currency as deflationary as possible) Long answer read the bitcoin-whitepaper (it's only 9 pages long).
