Oh hey thanks for this tip! I love Breadwallet's simplicity, except I didn't like transacting in millibits.

Thanks for not shilling a specific alt. Here, have an upvote.

If you didn't sell when price went under 3k, then congrats on surviving your first crash!
No one can accurately predict crashes, or storms as you called it. But you saw how fast it bounced from 3k to 3.8k right? Bitcoin will survive future crashes as well. 
If you're not a veteran trader, don't even think about shorting BTC now, just because you feel something is looming. I can almost guarantee that you'll only lose some of your money.

There are some who will draw a symmetrical triangle on it, a bullish flag. But your timeframe is too short, I I wouldn’t put too much weight on it.

Fun facts:
IOTA has been tanking for more than 2 months now. 
If you bought IOTA during the previous all time low in mid-July, your equivalent holding in BTC would lower today that what you had 3 months ago. 
IOTA’s wallet is so buggy that if you miss an update, the next time time you open your wallet, you’ll be greeted with “you have zero balance”. The fix requires tinkering with some configurations but it’s still annoying AF. 
The IOTA team rolled their own crypto instead of using known secure and tested crypto code, and researchers from MIT and Boston University discovered bugs in that they were able to exploit. It has since been fixed, but they still rolled their own crypto.

I didn’t notice a sweep function in the Nano’s Chrome app myself.
If you meant sweeping funds from a paper wallet, I would: add the paper wallet private key into MyCelium for Android, and then send it to the Nano’s address.
Make sure you’re using a trusted Android phone. If in doubt, wipe it and reinstall Android using the official image.
