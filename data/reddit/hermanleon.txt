You, and me, and everybody who decides to join a network not controlled by a few individuals, but is decentralized and peer-to-peer. A network safer and faster than anything else seen before, that allows you for near instant transfers, to anyone/anywhere in the world for nearly free (can transfer billions for a few cents fee). It is a push vs pull payment, so you do not have to give your personal info to 3rd parties in every transaction. Allows you to make microtransactions, that in itself is a whole new universe that none of the current payment methods can offer.
Then... infinite more possibilities like smart contracts, escrow, fraudless voting, secure micro-donations, wills, etc. Check also into 'sidechains'. Bitcoin is programmable money. It is very safe, since is cryptographically secured by a distributed global mathematical algorithm and public decentralized open source ledger, a revolutionary disruptive technology.Empowering and welcoming to the game to billions of unbanked or underbanked people.

Not necessarily, the bitcoin ecosystem can grow bigger enough and make obsolete those (for now useful) centralized companies.

He is just trolling fake tips.  Tagged and reported.
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:47:13


You most be new, it goes in cycles, trolls were saying the same in 2009, then in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013.
So next big "drop" will be something like from $7,000 to $2,000, and the trolls will continue singing the same song: "OMG that is a big drop!...bitcoin is dead now!"

This is not a "movement", this is freedom for all to join whatever movement they feel like, without government coercion in a rigged playing field. While OP sounds extreme, this is what we need right now: to say NO MORE to the few in charge doing things we don't like with our money. Bitcoin is a very practical and non-violent way to defund corrupt oligarchs and  reclaim the original power where it belongs. So bitcoin lets us represent ourselves and get rid of those we were trusting to represent us.

Hey, he is trying to promote bitcoin and have some other great ideas, have some fun man! Don't downvote creativity just because you don't personally like it ;o)
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:14:41
Yes, and there are dozens of new accounts created every week just to troll r/bitcoin, this is obviously a concerted effort and it is difficult to believe that they are doing it for free, or just because they "hate" bitcoin. 
Moderators posted already that we get to see only the tip of the iceberg, since they remove tons of posts and comments made by those trolls. They would make their job easier and this subreddit cleaner and friendlier if they just banned the obvious trolls/repeat offenders (like all the ones you listed, with a 100% trolling  rate).
And this only will get worse the more popular bitcoin becomes, since the ones opposing it have deep pockets, pockets that are getting threatened by this technology,and won't hesitate to pay more trolls to get to work against bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:54:29
Edit: I just checked and is the only tip pending to be delivered, while newer ones are shown as delivered. So I guess that subreddit does not allow tipping? ;0(
Let's contact the mods of to fix that
