Regarding the latest ETF letter submission by ARK Investment Management LLC: 
It really depends on if you read the letter while having a leveraged long position at the same time. or not. 
when you are full hype mode, everything is good news^^TM .
However from the regulator's perspective, there seems to be some serious red flags brought up, and unlike the troll comments, by JStolfi, in the last round, these guys actually brought up pretty substantive points, that may prevent any ETF, from being approved, within the foreseeable future.
One of the serious concerns was that there is a major conflict of interest, since Gemini is a terrible exchange, with no liquidity or volume, and it was alleged that the Twins were using an ETF to try and pump their exchange products at the expense of ETF users. 
Without going into details, having ulterior motives and plans to manipulate users, without their knowledge and understanding, would actually be quite a serious concern to regulators. Just because OKCoin does all sorts of shady dealings, doesnt make it ok for the rest of the world, in fact there are laws that specifically prohibit shenanigans in regulated countries (to protect traders and consumers of course). 
Of course the conclusion is most concerning: That bitcoin markets are currently too illiquid, to withstand artificial pumps and dumps. Regulators are not going to add a product that will definitely be manipulated, yet due to its nature, the regulators will not be able to take any action that will be able to prevent this kind of activity. This is so, since this kind of nefarious activity will continue to occur in China and they have no Authority to prosecute market manipulators in that country.
Not going to analyse the entire thing right now. If anyone else wants to comment on other details, feel free to add more info to the thread.
Not sure what decision options the final regulators have, but I wouldnt be surprised if they would say something like "Come back in 5-10 years and we'll see if the product has matured or it might still will not be suitable for an ETF". 
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:31:37

@_date: 2016-11-13 05:22:16
Agreed. If they list the ETF anyway, they might open themselves to legal liability, in the event things dont go well.
Their best course of action is to tell the applicants, to reapply when bitcoin matures.

Gold Prices Plummet 6%, and looking to crash even more.






TLDR: Gold is crashing to levels not seen in a long time. Stocks are surging since there are expectations that they will pay out record profits, due to potentially positive changes to regulatory systems in the USA, that will drastically enable improvement in business operations. People are therefore pulling all their cash, out of their savings, and buying stocks.

Wouldnt be surprised if some big investors pull out of bitcoin for the meantime and invest in the stock market as massive economic growth may now be expected, with Trump as president and republicans in control of congress and the senate. He actually has a shot at pulling off whatever he plans to do in order to help the country grow.

Does anyone know if the "The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)" monitors bank transfers to bitcoin exchanges in China, since they might be considered akin to "wire transfer services"?
If they already monitor exchange bank accounts, or start doing so, then bitcoin will no longer be useful for capital outflows for large amounts. However if they just let it be, then Bitcoin will be a useful way to transport large sums out of the system, without government approval.

they could shut down all exchanges rather easily. without all newly mined coins being bought up, price would crash pretty hard, as global demand is actually quite low.

not anywhere near despair. 34k of BTC margin longs open on bitfinex and its only rising.
These guys dont want to close in profit. They want to hodl until moon or margin call, whichever comes first, nevermind the absurdly high interest they are paying every single day: 
Why close above $700 when you can panic sell for less than $500 when you get margin called and lose everything...
This isnt the dip, the dip will be much much lower. Buy low sell high, not buy high.

Gold tumbled an additional 3% on Monday 14 November (Australian time). Stronger US dollar and higher bond yields took the shine off the precious metal. The gold spot price fell to its lowest point in five months.
U.S. bond yields have surged on hopes that a boost to fiscal spending succeeds. Rising bond yields make gold a less-attractive prospect for investors, as the metal pays nothing to its holders.

Roundup of the latest Segwit news. Looks like many mining pools are "rebelling" and refusing to upgrade to the latest Core software: 
What does this mean for bitcoin adoption? 
Well many people will interpret this in different ways. But the dream of using bitcoin as any sort of transaction protocol keeps drifting out of view. As the more users who pile into the network, the more transaction fees will continue to rise. 
Soon one of the only options, will be to keep bitcoins on centralized platforms, in order to actually get your transactions broadcast, without paying paying ridiculous fees. 
Sounds like paypal 2.0 ... especially now that coinbase has in the past frozen accounts and funds, plus now they have the IRS requesting info on all their users.
A "decentralized network" that forces users to use centralized services in order to process any transactions, kind of kills the idea.
It makes sense at this point to sit on the sidelines with FIAT and wait to see if any solutions present themselves or maybe this might be the time for people to try and see what other alternatives might just be out there.

Well they have a certain amount of hash power and they basically said they would block segwit because they are using Bitcoin Unlimited which does not support Segwit.


Of course you can buy bitcoins directly on exchanges, however many investors dont want to go down this route. An ETF would have enabled more people to buy bitcoins. However this has likely been pushed down the road for an uncertain amount of years.

If lightning is implemented there will be big business for large companies to open payment channels and offer their services to users for a small fee.
These companies will need to own massive amounts of bitcoins, especially if they will want to expand become large well known lightning network services. 
These kinds of services will be funded 100% on transaction fees and will likely generate more fees than even miners. The only cost to run the service will basically be the initial bitcoin that they will need to purchase. Then they will just lock in their bitcoins and make a killing from fees. 
easy and insanely profitable. Although the only requirement will be to have massive amounts of capital to purchase bitcoins.

lmao, ye sure if you like paying in person use checks and cash.
paying and managing all your bills online is a breeze and its even possible to automate your payments. I'm sure there are many other convenient reasons that people can enumerate to explain these points further.
 the 4-6% savings are added since they save on processing fees, chargebacks, late payments and possibly have the ability to fully automate the process since no middlemen are involved, so they can hire less staff, eg. accepting cash requires them to hire someone to accept the payments.
@_date: 2016-09-29 06:51:01
So a few whales who can offer massive liquidity will profit greatly. Some large corporations would probably purchase insane amounts of bitcoins and try fill this role. Think multinational.

I dont see why everyone thinks that bitcoin will only increase in value under Trump. It would do much better under Hillary who will continue the cycle of unlimited spending and increasing USA debt. 
The US dollar will continue to become increasingly useless and people will only be too happy to use alternate currencies including bitcoin rather than a FIAT currency that continues to erode each day.
Lets not forget all the rich guys who will have all their taxes raised under Hillary and will be looking for "swiss bank accounts in their back pockets" etc. Persecuting these guys will only lead to more and more alternative/shadow banking systems emerging (including bitcoin).

pretty cool device. 
How much is the wifi router actually worth? 
How much power does this device consume above regular routers (in $ per day/year)?
Best of luck to whoever buys one and wins a block!

It aint an all or nothing. thats a false dilemma.

except that is not the case at all. It might be that people buy with USD and the demand is increasing, hence a price rise.

Air gapped machine/cell-phone or hardware wallet (easy to use but more expensive) for security.

Well on the plus side, it shows just how amazing Satoshi was. 
Cant fully appreciate satoshi's efforts until others try to compete and completely fail.

they were a decent service, but then they jacked up their service/commission fees. 
Usual crap business. Get people in then screw them by raising all fees and hope they wont leave.

not really. they would get caught if they tried.
