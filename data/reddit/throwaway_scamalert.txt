I spoke to federal agencies about these guys years ago, but their investors should also be aware of the kind of company &amp; founder they're investing in.

Yeah I saw what happened with some of the other platforms out there. But at least none of those are marketing their products to non-accredited average consumers...

Lol thanks man. Hopefully I can get some eyes on this info before they raise again.

Lol it gets pretty crazy, you're not too far off the mark

Where would you recommend I post? Most of their investors are also crypto/BTC investors.
Also, this was approved by a mod here.

I have some inside information regarding a possible MAJOR scam targeting non-accredited crypto investors, and I'm not sure what to do with this information.
I made a full post about it in another sub today, but I would like to get some feedback. Is there anyone in the community who could help shed some light on this?

Why? People should have all the necessary information so they can do their own research on these people before investing.

If there is anyone in the media who might be interested in discussing this, you can send me a message here. I can provide ample sources and more details.

Craziest thing happened tonight... a few hours after I posted this, the guy who runs UpTrennd announced an official partnership with these guys. I wonder if people in crypto just don’t even care about these scams anymore, I hope he will see this and do more due diligence before he ties his reputation to this project and gets his followers to invest. Overseas non-accredited people sending a wire transfer to PrefLogic wouldn’t have much legal recourse as far as I know.

I sent you a message!

I agree, it’s a new way for scammers to perpetrate old scams. Really disappointing to see and it makes the entire market and industry look bad.
@_date: 2019-11-01 18:13:20
That's fine, but I'm not going to present a case of possible scam/fraud without verifiable sources and evidence.
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:36:57
Thanks man. I hope more eyes get on this and that people will find this info and do their own due diligence before investing more money. The fact that they are targeting average people is the worst part.
