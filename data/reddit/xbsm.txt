My post is not about Russian companies. Its about improving Bitcoin's ecosystem by creating some startups / solutions to make awesome Bitcoin services available for our Russian payment systems. e.g. I don't see any reason for Purse.IO for not accepting our national Qiwi payment - why won't we make some tool to convert any received funds from Russian Qiwi to Bitcoin payment directed towards Purse.IO? Why won't we do the same thing about every Bitcoin startup?
Its almost like integrating PayPal into most Bitcoin services. Yes its a philosophical question whether some service should or shouldn't make PayPal available along with Bitcoin, because most Bitcoiners think that **only Bitcoin** should be patriotically and solely being implemented.
But I don't think it is good thing to ignore other **easy** payment systems. The same way as it is not a good thing to ignore other dialects by not localizing your software (at least everybody agree with me on this point, right?).
In order for Bitcoin to get massive adoption, we should not rely on teaching everyone using Bitcoin, but there also should be maximum penetration in terms of: 1) **localization** - which means translating any Bitcoin companies into as many world languages ; 2) **payment domestication** - which means that every Bitcoin-startup should integrate as much as possible worldwide payments.
As the case with Russian payments, it don't costs anything to start accepting Qiwi/Sber/YM/Wm **today**. Its really as cheap and as effortless as 0

scarcity starting to scare me! Please everybody don't panic. Calm down. We've got at least 1 year of abundant mining. Still got enough time to earn that bitcoin buck
