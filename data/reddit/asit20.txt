I had a backup but they sent all my bitcoins to another adresse. I have access to my account.

Blockchain info have stolen my bitcoins and they said that they were hacked. I am very angry. IS this acceptable from a big Company. I did not do these transactions. They did these transactions and they don''t do anything to solve the problem. I did not ask for chargebacks. I asked for my bitcoins that they were in my wallet and then they were stolen by them or by a hacker. They need to solve this issue. Please kindly spread the link over facebook and twitter.

I'm sorry, but the bitcoin network is designed to make chargebacks impossible. Blockchain.info never has access or control of a user's bitcoins in any way. This means we have no power to stop or reverse a transaction for you. Unfortunately, there is little recourse for such situations. There are no chargeback features available through the bitcoin network and legal action is often more costly than the offense itself due to the highly complicated and international nature of bitcoin. I'm sorry again, we don't have an amiable solution for you in regards to these matters.
Then they don''t answer me anymore. please spread the message everywhere till they resolve this problem

Could you explain more what happened ? i was thinking of investing there 
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:38:45
The above link shows the transaction. I am not lying. They have stolen my bitcoins. It is up to anyone to keep his bitcoins in this website. The support team did not solve my issue. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:49:21
I did not know. i trusted their website and their security. Now they are not answering anymore. I hope that their customer support reply here and solve this problem. Please kindly spread the link everywhere. Thank you

Look, i used all the security precaautions that they asked on their website. I can''t do more. I have been with them for a month now. I choosed their wallet because of its easy interface and security. I lost all my funds. They said that all my funds has been transferred to a Russian Hacker. Does this make sense ? Please Blockchain info solve my problem. Thank you. please anyone reading this to share this post everywhere on facebook and twitter till it is resolved. It can happen with anyone. Thank you

By the way, i don''t have teamviewer. I was checking my wallet on my computer as usual. Then few minutes later, they took my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:40:44
The proof is in the link above now.

yes. i have made them. They sent the bitcoins to another adresse without my authorization. I think there is a big corruption in this organization. They don't answer anymore. They blocked me from their facebook page. there is a complete absence of credibility. If you have your bitcoins over there, you are risking them. that is an awful experience with this site. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:29:04
No it was through my phone 
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:42:53
It looks like that you work with them. anyway, if they told you that they were hacked by a russian hacker and they have stolen your all bitcoins like they did with me you won't say this i am sure. I did everything they asked to protect my wallet. They are not safe. Check other forums ! this happened with many on their website. if I knew i would have never used their website. They have poor customer service as well. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:32:34
Thank you for your precious comments :-)
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:35:26
I don't know how to post pictures here but it is available for anyone who message me. They have stolen my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:45:39
No they told me that there is a Russian hacker who stolen my bitcoins. How would they know that ? tell me if they have not given my account data to someone else. It is up to you but they have stolen my bitcoins. Many persons will have the same destiny like mine if they continue to store their bitcoins over there. They speak about security. I did everything which i can do over their website. What else should i have done then they have stolen me. It is clear now. I have lost all my coins in this website because they have been compromised
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:37:40
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:41:07
Yes i received these 2 dollars during the attack and they they stolen everything.
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:32:21
They have access. They have stolen my bitcoins. Now they don't answer. I will keep posting every week to warn others about what could happen with their bitcoins if they continue using this website. No customer service is present.
