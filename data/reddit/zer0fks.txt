4.9TB in a week? Took me a month to nearly get 4TB. How much memory does your node have?

Twelve reporting now. Thanks for supporting a failed hostile takeover of Bitcoin.

Anyone want to buy pieceajit.com? It's up for renewal and I don't feel like giving it another $12.

I appreciate your paranoia, don't just be crypto-focused. Your tax returns are out there and tie together your name, address, social security number, W2 earnings, and all other reported income.
So you'd never purchase something from Overstock with crypto?

A billion is nothing these days. Montgomery County, Maryland (among the richest in the nation) is over $4B in debt.

Initially I ran with them disabled, but after I revisited they immediately started working.

Depends on the speed of your line and your firewall. My servers can exceed 150Mbps and I can still max out the gigabit line with file downloads and my ping while gaming is still 5ms.

I'm with on this. I don't know if he's exactly right on all of his points, but fuck Coinbase. Not, I mean, butt fuck Coinbase..... Just fuck Coinbase.
They will never enable lightning on their network. They have moved against bitcoin, and dislike the core developers. Do not trust them, do not support them.
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:14:28
They shouldn't under a neutral net, so it depends on your provider. I have a residential FiOS line and run a TOR relay, and a BTC and lightning node; 7K+ connections and do 1TB every day or so.
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:23:32
If bitnodes can't see you on 8333, then check to see if you're running properly;
`netstat -lnp | grep 8333`
Should give you an output like:
`tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8333            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      715/bitcoind`

They pay the outbound TX fees; this only helps them.

Channels with you are most of my capacity.
Have some questions;
- Do you share or have failover bitcoin node backends?
- What bitcoin node do you run?
- What OS?
- What provider?
- How do you harden to mitigate attacks?
Please feel free to private message if you don't want all of this public.

I suppose it was a reference to the block reward. Of which even blocks weren't discussed. Also miners aren't nodes so the video is actually confusing once you make it past the 'explain it to Grandma in 12 seconds' phase.

A lot of it is interest on loans and plenty more is debt the Gov owes to itself (like borrowing against Social Security).

Can we contract or escrow the payment so it's returned if you don't follow through?

Thanks!! Threw the list on my firewall and it now has 450 more IPs to block!
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:06:10
You could still make a share, mount it on a pi, symlink ~/.bitcoin to the mount point and run bitcoind on the pi with the nas as the datastore.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:52:29
Yes, preferably hosted so that my router could pull on a daily/periodic basis.
This way I'm not running 3rd party scripts on my node.
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:52:09
Could you pipe that into a CIDR list so I can block using pfBlockerNG on my firewall? The list can look like [this](
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:01:31
I'd avoid using a 3rd party ppa. Just download the binary from bitcoin.org. That way you can force which version you're running and also not running the 3rd party default configs.

A reasonable supply of appropriately priced trusted hashing hardware?

Running autopilot on lnd; none were created manually. About a dozen are funded with my own coin.

If you're worried about associating your public IP with your node then you could route it all through TOR.
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:32:42
Very easy, assuming you've gotten this far using the command line. I can't find the guide I used, but you install tor, then essentially port forward to bitcoind from a tor port on localhost, giving your .onion URL a place to land on your hidden service. And then there's something else about advertising it. I run regular port forwarding and through tor, bitcoind and lnd on debian 9. Normally have about 250 established connections. CPU usage is minimal, about 1GB of memory is committed though another 2 are buffered. I would expect a pi to swap some, so make sure you have a swap space enabled and vm.swappiness &gt; 0 (default is 60 but I run 1).
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:48:50
I will find my lnd node with any tips received.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:02:55
I give a fuck, and I run Linux. And FreeBSD.

Just running a node on autopilot.

Running off-the-shelf lnd. After it was setup and running 10 channels, I migrated it to a new user, so the channels were all closed and the balance transferred on-chain to the new lightning wallet. Since then I've opened about 40 channels.
