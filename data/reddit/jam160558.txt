Yeah I mean what is really to stop it falling back to where it started the year in 2017. Nobody really has any idea. People saying buy the dips, the recent trend is just downwards with slight bumps upwards, then down again further than last time... I wouldn't be surprised if it keeps falling. Do think there will be some future use for Crypto but it seems a long way off

Yeah they are waving their magic wand and sprinkling some fairy dust on their computers which is making the price drop. The price is dropping because people are realising there is actually no value in BTC other than sentiment. I have asked a good few times on here and nobody can offer a counter-argument... so we are likely on the way back down to zero

Yes but what is the value now I am trying to ascertain, the things you are saying are just sentiment... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:09:00
Where is the upslope?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:03
Will it though or is that just blind hope? Interested to know why you think it will rise again

Here comes the US sell off - brace yourselves for freefall

Orrr you have just bought into the dream

Does nobody think that it will continue dropping. What is the actual underlying value in Bitcoin, it is purely based on market sentiment, if the sentiment drops, the price drops. It appears forums like this are full of people with hope more than anything. Sorry to be naysayer, just trying to understand more

One sweet ass pump and dump
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:57:17
yes exactly. It's like people can't fathom that it will drop...
