I had problems to fall a sleep a few weeks ago.. put too much crypto in my head. I forced my self not to look into Coinmarketcap or reddit after 8 pm and calm down in this time instead. Worked good for me :D

It definetly is and we need more transparency of these huge transactions moving the market... if anyone could build a tracker? I have no experience in programming but I got a few ideas .. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:35:19
At least he’s trying to make people aware of it.. but yeah, there could be more effective ways in taking influence. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 07:53:29
It'll allow institutional money to flow easier into the market. The Bitcoin ETF can than be traded at traditional stock exchanges and not at creepy exchanges. The problem is, that a synthetical financial product gets traded. It's backed by Bitcoins, but the people trading it won't have the actual Bitcoin / private Key. The idea of Bitcoin is to make intermediaries (banks) less powerful. With the ETF's approved, they'll have a lot of control over the market. I hope it won't get allowed!

We need to break 12.000$. Way more interesting than the 10.000$ wall.
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:53:46
Never thought that I'm gonna say that but thanks SEC! Seems like they really made thoughts about what was gonna happen. I'm pretty happy about the decision since Bitcoin is not meant to be a synthetic finance product. Bitcoin is a currency!

@_date: 2019-11-25 13:38:53
How does the recent dip affect Bitcoin mining in general in your opinion? What results could a miner capitulation have?
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:14:31
Good timing. Hope you bought in again afterwards!

Gold is a good way of storing value. It's established since thousands of years. So I wouldn't hate it that much. I think Bitcoin is simply more viable since you don't need a donkey to transfer it from place A to B.

Got a quick question. I considered booking a hostel and pay with bitcoin (they offer it as a payment solution). What about the transactions costs? The price would be around 50$, is it worth paying with bitcoin?

Because if you pay 3x 0,03 btc, it’s already around 0,1 btc which is 10.000 $ in 10 years. That’s my way to think about it ��
