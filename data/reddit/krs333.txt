As per another members advice, i'm posting my iGot customer ID in case anyone from iGot would care to take any action to rectify my situation. Customer ID

Further Update:
I have been given a generous credit in compensation.  I guess this company is not necessarily shady or working on any exit scams, just extremely slow.  
To sum up my advice after it all. 
iGot is instant buy/sell (as they are the buyers and sellers themselves) so you get the listed trade price, instantly.  Which is fantastic. 
But expect withdrawals and support tickets and deposits to take up to 3 weeks!

i get what ur saying and thanks but this actually not a bitcoin issue. it's straight up cash. aussie bank to aussie bank. ive started a chat with our "overlords" accc, even if the transfer clears they clearly intentionally delayed for the interest these combined accounts likely hold.

I received a response today on one of my support tickets. They claim due to human error, my funds were transferred to an incorrect account number and bounced back to iGot.  They have now re issued the transfer and I have received my money now after a full 30 freaking days of first wanting my money back!
Although this is a relief, there is still no explanation why all my enquiries, emails and support tickets were left unanswered for over 2 weeks, causing me some serious stress and freak out.
I guess this company doesn't give 2 shits of what 1 person thinks but swoops in asap when their workings are made public. 
It should not of come to this. If you expect people to trust you with their hard earned cash and btc, get your shit together iGot.

Firstly, I am not one for publicly defaming but in this situation iGot has left me gutted and sick with stress and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.
So here is the rundown of events:
1. Opened account.
2. Went through verification process and received level 2 (highest) verification.
3. Deposited a large sum of money.
4. Deposit was not reflected in my wallet for 3 weeks. during this time I emailed them over 5 times, posted a complaint on their facebook page (which they removed), started a support ticket. 
5. Finally i received a reply and deposit was cleared. I started trading btc for a few weeks and due to their low commission and simple interface, I was happy and transferred all my BTC from other markets to iGot.
6. Decided I should trial a withdrawal before carrying on with all my eggs in one basket. Sold all BTC with intentions to withdraw my full $ balance to my bank account.  
7. Immediately after selling all my BTC my verification level was dropped to level 1 with no explanation. at level 1 you can not withdraw cash.
8. I started a support ticket and emailed them and it took 7 days to clear it up and bring my verification level back to level 2 (allowing withdrawals).
9. On 06.03.2015 I submitted a withdrawal request to cash out all my funds to my bank account.  
10. 14 days pass and my withdrawal is still marked “pending”. In this time I sent iGot numerous emails and support tickets with not a single reply.  So now I have no funds showing in my iGot account and no transfer has been made into my bank account. I have zero access.  At this point i’m literally sickened with stress.
11. On 20.03.2015 I get an email saying my withdrawal status has changed from “pending” to “confirmed” but funds are still not in my bank account.  My support ticket is closed by iGot with no response or explanation. 
12. It’s now 27.03.2015. I still have no funds available in my iGot account or my bank account. I have sent daily emails and support tickets. 
This is a huge amount of money for me (and probably for most people).
I am in Australia and so is iGot. I have provided them my bank details (confirmed with transfers), utility bills, credit card, drivers license, video call facial confirmation - the works. So this is not a security issue on their end. It’s completely inexcusable. 
DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.
