Chicken little much? Changetip does not represent the failure of Bitcoin for micropayments. If someone posts their receiving address (on reddit, YouTube, Facebook etc) then I'll use that, and it works great. If they don't post an address then changetip offers me a way to still give them money while using my preferred currency, Bitcoin.

Download bitaddress.org code from GitHub and put on USB
Boot into linux liveCD on a USB (disable networking/wifi), Ubuntu is easy 
Run bitaddress.org  off USB and create paper wallet with BIP38 password protected private key
Get something like this cryptocards.co
This set up allows you to have a cold wallet on an almost indestructible card out in the open and still be protected. They could check their balance using the public address or even send more money to that wallet. The downside is accessing the wallet requires the password, so that should be kept somewhere safe, and separate from the card.

I use coinbase and only had to wait 3 business days before doing instant buys, not a month. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 06:51:40
I do, and I get the raise. It's called a cost of living wage increase at my organization and it's given to all permanent employees in order to keep up with inflation.

Again, no. In the scenario proposed by the OP,  Bob is not receiving currency with the purpose of transmission - this has a very specific definition in financial regulation and refers to the business activity of moving funds, and does not apply to personal spending. Bob is also not holding funds on behalf of others.

I'm no fan of surveillance or back doors, but if you think the NSA or Apple is going to steal the bitcoins on your phone wallet then you're paranoid. Anyway, you shouldn't keep very much coin on a phone wallet regardless of the phone/OS. Thanks for the FUD though.

I want to tip on YouTube, but half of the people I encounter have a display name such as Joe Schmo (which won't work with changetip) versus their true username, such as joeschmozzltof. If I can't find their username how do I tip?
 
I'm using the YouTube app on iOS.

Your example is misleading. I can get up to $100 in bitcoin instantly through coinbase every 24hr, and so could you. That doesn't mean I like the ACH wait period on higher amounts, but your example looks a lot like flaming. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:31:12
They scramble the order now, so the easy questions may or may not be associated with a low dollar amount and vice versa. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:54:04
That can and does happen, but they have lifelines. If you watch the first 5 min you'll see that they scramble the order of the prize amounts and questions. Sometimes they'll win 25k on a super easy question. Anyway, you're not missing anything.

I'm using an iPhone 5 and it won't read a QR about half the time, just sits there. Here is a video where I try to use bitwallet to read a QR and it won't, then I open another wallet app (bitstore) and it reads it immediately. 
Can't use bitwallet if it won't read QR codes half the time.

Is that how you feel when walking down the street and see a musician with his hat out, that you should tip him $5+ or nothing? I agree there is a threshold, who wants subpennies. But I'd toss .50 to a street musician and I'd do the same to a redditor. (disclosure: my tips range from .50-3.50)

Your premise that we only know the losing bid from people who were part of a syndicate is false. We do know that the winning bid was at least higher than those who bid for a whole 3000 coin block but lost. Your comment about a 'stupid pump' assumes you know people's intentions and is an irrelevant ad hominem attack. 
EDIT: spelling

I've had the same thing happen every time using Circle. Fluctuating price isn't a valid excuse IMO. They should quote the purchase and honor that for a set time (2 minute timeout?). Coinbase has never done this to me, although there is the fee.

If you have clear proof of what you describe, hire an attorney in the company's  jurisdiction and include recovery of your legal fees in the suit.

Until a business can pay their own bills in Bitcoin (vendors, utilities, lease, etc) we're not going to see many businesses holding onto coin. I think it will happen as adoption increases. Until then, BitPay offers businesses a way to take the plunge with  no hassle.

Sure, except the following makes this not as great as you make it out to be:
1. You have to itemize and not take the standard deduction. If all you have to deduct is your Bitcoin loss, then you're getting LESS deductions for the year over the unitemized standard deduction. (See 
2. Bitcoin is treated as a commodity/property which has a limit of $3000 in allowed deduction due to loss. If this is your only deduction it's better to take the standard deduction (6k for single). 
3. Deduction amount does not equal the same amount of money in your pocket. Let's look at an example. I sell coin at a $1000 loss. I report the loss and I then get a $1000 reduction in taxable income - NOT a credit. So, at a tax bracket of 30% that represents $300 less in taxes owed. 
It may be a good strategy for some, but think carefully and visit an accountant with knowledge of Bitcoin, or at least commodities trading.

Because some losing  bidders revealed their bid amount, therefore we know the winning bid was above that. Unless you believe the losing bidders were lying, I'm not sure why you're pretending we don't anything about the winning bid.

Without more than a snappy video to look at, and admittedly a lack of technical expertise, how is storj different than freenet, which has been around for years? Also, the biggest issue I see with current decentralized storage networks is slow speed. How does your model overcome this issue?

There's no point if the tipping doesn't work. In fact I think it looks worse to have a tip that doesn't work than never have tipped at all. I tried to tip a music teacher $20 on YouTube and it didn't work, but he sure did notice and thought I was just being a smartass. I emailed changetip support and got no response. Get your sh*t together ChangeTip.

No, no, and no. The regulations are for financial services business operating IN New York, and Coinbase is a California business. Please show me where in the proposed regs it addresses private citizens sending btc from one wallet to another? Breathe people.

Another no vote. If someone wants to view it in bits fine. But leave the default in full bitcoin denomination.
