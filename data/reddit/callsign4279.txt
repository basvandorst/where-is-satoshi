Wine and the central coast, synonymous. Good to see someone is doing some crypto work around there.

Lol redditor for 4 weeks, did you forget where you’re posting? This is about as speculative as it can get. Never said family, and never said i was asking them to to make a decision they weren’t sure of. These people are already invested and don’t watch the markets as closely as people on this sub do. 
Thanks for your concern though, take it easy.

Anyone care to translate the billboard? Just curious as to what it says. Is this being promoted as an official currency or is the ruble “official”? Theres a lot of grey area and green men around these parts ��

Thanks for doing this, when I started frequenting this subreddit last year it would have been immensely helpful to have monthly recaps to try and catch up on what was new and exciting. 
Keep up the good work, this is way more insightful and entertaining than the daily price discussions 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:09:39
Its anyones game today, curious how this weekend will look. Been talking to some buddies about the dip telling them to buy in if they can afford it. Its payday but all my fiat went to bills ��
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:57:31
Whelp so much for a strong weekend
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:48:18
Oh man i was really missing out then. Ill have to go back and look at what was going on! 
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:06:31
Wait i thought you lost 5 bucks if you cancel a preorder though? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:28:22
More bitcoin clothing and sticker companies for sure.

I sorta laugh because everyone takes these predictions seriously but scoff at randoms in this thread making sorter term predictions 
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:23:30
Yeah things always turn on a dime around here but not really worried, still gotta get those sub 9k buys in ��
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:00:16
If we really mooned I think the last thing you’d want to do is advertise you just became a millionaire, etc. 
Bitcoin and crypto in general is different things to different people. Currently im not relying on crypto to make a living. So if i were to become wealthy through it I would definitely try to donate large parts of it to various charities, start ups, etc to increase adoption, help less fortunate than me. 
Obviously pay for and fund kids / grandkids tuition or rainy day funds. Pay off mortgage and maybe purchase some real estate. 
I’d probably continue to work though it would be substantially reduced hours.... but at the rate of today’s work environment employers will not be happy with you working anything less than 40 hours a week, so at the first sign of them giving me shit I’ll write my resignation letter on a $100 dollar bill and tell em to have a nice lunch on me. 
Then proceed to find new hobbies and something else, job or not to fill my time. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:45:43
So any real reason to switch? I saw it wanted me to sign up again and at that point I figured its the same amount of work to switch to something with higher volume? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:26:21
Totally went over my head, haven’t seen that in awhile ��
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:59:08
I like money too, but thats not the point why i started getting into crypto and im sure a few people would agree, yes it was a huge draw but not the only draw. I have a hard time seeing use cases for bitcoin besides trading for wealth. I HODL in hopes of easier use in the future and trade today to increase my stack. 
Looking at alt coins like ltc or eth i see more use than btc and would probably use those for real life instances before i trade away my btc. 
Itd be great to see people pivot back to solving problems like forking this damn thing death (not just bashing forks) or coming up with more secure ways to bring it mainstream. I feel like its in that in between spot where nerds know how to use it but the average joe gets taken advantage of using some crappy app like robinhood to “trade crypto” thinking hes in on the action. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:31:35
Banish them to the bitcoinmarkets sub then i say! Which i should probs start using too ��
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:28:00
I have the most rudimentary knowledge of the tech, my first understanding of crypto was powered by this could be worth more money eventually, which grew to wanting to know more about it in general. 
I wonder if dips and flash crashes get people more interested in the tech side of things, thats what did it for me. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:40:09
So gdax is no more? Coinbase pro took its place. Im sure a simple search would get me some results but any suggestions on a new exchange to use?

so what i gathered is everyone who uses venmo should start putting cuban in their notes to cause their employees to work overtime
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:40:02
Or post the video of you defacing currency lol 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:54:07
Thanks for taking the time to write out something thoughtful, it would have been beneficial to have seen this when i was buying in a few months ago. 
I agree that its fun to come here to see memes etc, but id much rather see real info and maybe a paragraph or two vs a picture with a price
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:58:00
Long live the dip��
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:03:56
Huh. A small enough amount that I actually wouldn’t mind spending crypto on that. 
All someone needs to do is create some sort of vending option to offer next to coinstar now. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:36:33
Az doesn’t fuck around with  cannabis and regularly targets people associated with it, obviously this case the undercover officer brought up the fact he was “manufacturing” cannabis products and the guy not only showed interest but explains how to avoid detection. 
I wonder what would have happened differently if he didnt engage in discussing using crypto / cannabis together. 
All in all more shady shit by LEO than this dude was probably up to anyway.

@_date: 2018-04-30 16:15:33
Overall a decent weekend! Pretty impressed staying above 9k even though i didnt do much trading. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:45:30
Damn i really gotta stop playing with my buy orders, shoulda held for the dip!

This is true, emotional trades or being impatient are 100% my undoing, as with many others here that probably dont want to admit it. Overall im talking .005 so no real skin to lose or gain. Still able to make trades but the last week or two has gotten me fatigued with these swings. Im doing 1-2 trades a day vs. 8-10 at the end of march. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:15:43
You can also post up a WTB ( willing to buy) order that might net you some better results instead of scouring through that sub for something within your price range / preferences
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:40:39
Was hoping to buy in late this weekend when it dipped below 6.5 again but it never happened. Hopes not dead yet! 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:12:52
Look up the subreddit r/pmsforsale  some users over there are willing to deal with crypto for the sale of precious metals
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:44:33
Can also confirm got a cat about 2 years ago and questionable purchases have been happening since.
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:26:25
Its been an interesting weekend, wasent expecting such resistance for 9k but i was surprised that we didnt have massive dips after each test
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:21:20
Agreed, nice to see some activity, regardless if we dip again. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:04:42
Didnt even follow my own advice later in the day and missed out yet again, lol smh. I still appreciate action over inaction any time. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:34:22
Shower thoughts, if new bitcoins mined each year was the **only** thing regulated by government would it help or hinder
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:53:41
Really hoping it’ll scratch 6.5 early this week but thats small potatoes for me. Would much rather have it at 7k for awhile

A business card with all sorts of information should be given to people who buy crypto. 
Heres how to cold store it
Heres how to store your seed etc. 
Here are legitimate software and hardware wallet sources
Heres how to exchange crypto for services or trading.
