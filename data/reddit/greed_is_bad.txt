You've been reading too much of the cesspool that is r/politics

Sounds good, thanks for the explanation

Can someone explain why everyone on this sub is pro segwit anti unlimited while everyone on r/btc is pro unlimited anti segwit?

None of that is true.

We are possibly on the cusp of another bubble with ETF approval happening. Buying now has a ton of upside with very little downside.

Someone sees the transaction and cracks my private key with their quantum computer **before** my transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. 
They then resend the transaction to their own address with a higher fee. (remember, they cracked my private key so they can now import my address into their wallet) 
This second transaction with the higher fee is mined first, and my coins are sent to their wallet, and the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain.
Now, when my original transaction with the lower fee is mined, it will be taken as a double spend because the address is already empty.

Andreas had a really great talk about this called currency wars and bitcoins neutrality.
Basically, in developed western nations bitcoin is not necessary for survival or everyday life, but in a lot of places it is literally essential for survival, like in Venezuela people use Bitcoin to buy food from amazon pantry and have it delivered to a bordering country and then smuggle it in. (Famine and hyperinflation in venezuale, in case you didn't know)
I recommend the whole video, can't link it now but just search currency wars bitcoin

Quick question:
Does this affect Mycelium 12 word HD wallets or bitaddress.org generated paper wallets (encrypted with passphrase)

Will we have warning before a fork happens?

Its not a flaw, it's one of the things that make it useful. Why should the government or a bank have control of your own money

Just hearing about purse, is there any way this could backfire? Like the buyer wants a refund and amazon hounds you to give the package back?
edit: nvm figured it out

Like someone else said, BTC is not completely anonymous. A forensic investigation of the blockchain by the FBI for example will still enable them to find their coins. Cash is far more anonymous and harder to trace.

Have you talked to the credit union specifically about this and asked if they've dealt with cryptocurrency/ bitcoin exchange transactions when you opened your account?

I *just* created a Coinbase account 2 days ago. All I had to do was provide a picture of my drivers license front and back. It was approved within 2 minutes. 
Never did it ask me to take a picture of myself with the webcam or anything else

don't even touch the faucets
don't send money to any sketchy sites they are scams
Use regulated and insured exchanges like Coinbase.com or Gemini.com to buy

There are some here with hundreds or thousands of coins.
There are some that are leveraged long so a $1 move up results in a $100 or $1000 or $10000 gain. 
For some, it is just symbolic and a sigh of relief after 3 whole years
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:08:12
Can you clarify your ending comment? If 1 BTC is $100000 and you have 2.1 that is 210000. You can live off of that for the rest of your life in Asia?

It's different on each exchange. 1175 on finex, 1163 on stamp, 1097 on BTCe. Was 8000 on OKC and we already breached it in Jan new ATH is 8888.

The UK is a fucking Orwellian nightmare. No freedom of speech, other freedoms slowly being taken away.

Lmao you are terrible at math. It's .075 percent of your 100 BTC position which would be .075 bitcoin in this case, which is still only .75 percent of your margin.

Lol the protests are a fucking joke. Enjoy 8 years of Trump you cuck
