Where the fuck did you get THAT impression?  Can you READ what I wrote?

good point. I guess I never really thought about hiding assets like that.

I think that's great!  But I created this throw-away account to let you know that she's not the oldest.  She might want to get together with my Grandfather who turns 100 early next year.
In 2011, he asked me what to do with money he had in two stocks (Ford was one; the other was a local company), and I told him he should put it into Bitcoin.  Roughly $8000 at $8.
He has enough money outside of Bitcoin to last a lifetime.  But, at $200K, it has significantly increased his net worth.
Which brings up an interesting situation, hence the throwaway account.  Medicaid covers all sorts of end-of-life care, but they make you spend most every penny of your own money before you can touch it.  He's from a generation that is too proud to accept "welfare", as he calls Medicaid, (not too proud to accept Social Security and Medicare..., which was sold to him as a retirement program, but we disagree on that point).  
I'd never tell him what to do or what not to do with his money, but the point is that there could be a lot of money hiding with Bitcoin and elderly down the road!

Fuck off ASSHOLE.  
If YoU HaVe No ComPreHension CapABility, and don't KNOW the US TAX law, You are a fucking retard.
if he has gains in Bitcoins, there is NO Capital Gains Tax until he sells them.  He is NOT taking any Tax payer BENEFITS, so what the FUCK are you TALKING about.  If you would fucking read with at least FIFTH GRADE COMPREHENSION, you would understand that. 
I made it VERY clear in my FIRST post.  He won't accept Federal aid of any kind.  How fucking stupid are you?

How did you miss the concept that he refuses to accept Medicaid?

Oh, I felt like shit when it dipped WELL below $8!
But he kept telling me that he was "thinking long term".   I love that guy!  He cracks me up.

I have no idea what you are talking about.
He hasn't dodged a single tax, and has ZERO capital gains.  He still owns the Bitcoins.
