I also thought his comment was idiotic, but does account # really matter?  I’m not even sure what account # this is, seems like I make a new one every 2 years or so and I remember when advice animals was on the front page.

It facilitates illegal transactions quite nicely. Besides, you can buy literally anything online. There will always be a buyer and seller, there are still native people in hunter gatherer societies. It’ll be a long time before crypto is completely irrelevant.

Talking about it yourself, 100%.  
Having your friend bring it up because he made 30k on your advice and you tripled that, 0%.

For you?  Absolutely not

Averages aren’t useful because the ranges are massive from the number of factors. Speaking just from my own experience, I built 6x6 GPU mining rigs. Living in LA the cost of electricity was up to $0.25/kWh and I know in Washington state $0.05/kWh is attainable. That’s a 5x difference and that’s strictly electricity cost, which varies based on your setup, location, etc. Your better off just doing research for what you could do in your area and with your resources.

The world is vastly different today than during WW2. I’d say we have already met that turning point in the face of the globalized, tech powered social media society we live in. The nature of it being global actually lessens the impact of any one event because there’s a much greater society now that most people are a part of. The wars of the past are gone. Now we have proxy wars (Russian separatists in Ukraine), terrorism (ISIS), and trade war (US and China).

One day they’ll be eating their words, don’t worry. Many people at first derided me because I spent 2 years buying coins and built 6 mining rigs (began in May 2017). Getting in then before the massive run up I’ve technically never gone below my first 1 BTC buy at 2300. Even now when I tell people about it, they’ll mention how they bought at $15k+ and lost a few thousand and tell me I should sell. But as soon as I mention 2300 they get quiet, then tell me about their shitty business idea or latest stock as if I could be their next angel investor. Still, everyone actually close to me did not talk down to me. But I also took quite a bit of time to talk to them about it, even prior to fall-winter 2017. Perhaps that’s why they think it works, at least for me. But your time will come too. Stay strong.

He said his avg buy in was 7200 so technically he is in the green even now. And nearly double back when it was 13k over the summer. Not bad really. Doing better than my stock portfolio.

It doesn’t have to be mindless, maybe the kid plays hockey, maybe his dad does. What if the kid loves the merchandise too?  It’s mutual. If his team moves the puck better, he gets to enjoy it and it is entertaining for him. That is a real difference. Being so ignorant to these basics is just dumb.

You seem upset. You also referred to a 4chan anon comment becoming a meme as conventional wisdom.

It’s not a myth, it’s lower risk than big buys. Which is to say, a big buy at a good price is obviously more rewarding. But of course more risky as well.

Buying on a big green candle is usually going to bite you in the short to mid term. An easy rule of thumb is buy on red and sell on green. Of course this takes immense willpower and emotional strength. But yeah, when it’s up 20%, it’s way more likely to head back down than keep pumping up.

It’s not cheating when there’s no rules against it, implicit or explicit.

You’re not wrong but my point is that people will use any store of value to conduct illegal transactions, bitcoin or fiat is irrelevant. Similarity prohibition did fuck all to stop drinking and in fact indirectly contributed to the rise of organized crime. I think bitcoin would actually be more effective at tracking illegal “money” if it were institutionalized.
@_date: 2019-04-19 04:29:23
Yeah they also use rolled up cash to transact for a reason, are you brain dead?
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:00:35
Jesus Christ dude does is really need to be explained to you how a recorded ledger would be effective at tracking illegal money better than pieces of paper?  Fuck off
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:27:34
Sad to say but I’ve blown 2 people’s minds when they said “bitcoin is used for illegal stuff” and I responded “every illegal thing that didn’t use bitcoin, used fiat”. Corner store robbery?  Fiat. Executive embezzlement?  Fiat. Madoff’s ponzi?  Fiat.

Colonization is a long ways off, something like mining would happen first. And currently it takes 7 months to get to Mars, one-way. Not to mention the astronomical (heh) cost to get there. The moon is only 3 days away but so far there are virtually no valuable resources there.

It’s like a tipping point - maybe it got a few people to buy who were already close to the fence. And then another piece brings a few more closer, and another, and each one brings in a few more. At some point you can only hear about something so many times before you make a decision. That’s honestly how I got in. Heard about it enough times that when a random person at my friends house is talking about it and I can overhear it on discord - I started doing research and the rest is history. That was May 2017.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:25:18
You’ve had 6 months to buy cheaper, even half price.

The thing is, it's very easy to do both if you spent 1 hour of your life planning finances.

Never forget that you and only you are responsible for your BTC. There is no recourse outside of taking things in your own hands (don’t).
