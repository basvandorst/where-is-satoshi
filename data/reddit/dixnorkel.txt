Knowing Nigeria, probably inflation.
edit - Dude, fuck this sub.  I'm convinced everyone here is stupid or a bot.  Do you not get that people buy other currencies when their country is experiencing inflation?  Especially now that they can order it from home.  It's the reason I got into Bitcoin, and I'm sure it's definitely catching on in Nigeria since they've had over 12 months at 18% inflation.
Jesus fucking christ I have found zero useful information here since I subbed.  Fuck off, all y'all.

I bought in because Donald Trump seems to be de-legitimizing the US, and I don't know where to invest next.  
Not sure if other people are thinking the same way, but I was happy to see it jump right after I purchased.
Edit - Discouraged that I'm seeing more downvotes than discussion, feeling pretty glad that I subscribed in multiple places for bitcoin outlook.
Is this place less for future speculation, or more focused on promoting the adoption of Bitcoin or something?  Honestly curious.

Yeah, I was trying to think of an economy that would be safe from the repercussions and couldn't really come up with much besides North Korea and Russia.  Not sure I want to invest in a dictatorship or an oligopoly, though.

LOL.

I'd say misleading, but what do I know? I'm just a miner, apparently they're irrelevant too.

I don't think you'll continue to see exponential price increases for years, 7.5k is a very high entry price for a currency that not that many people use due to inconvenience/high fees.  
The price will dip considerably right before the fork happens, I'd wait until right before to buy, or buy 2X afterwards.

I thought block size was irrelevant?

Why say bitcoins?  There's likely only going to be one after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:27:35
You're going to want to read up on the upcoming fork, there's a good chance that the price of BTC will dip considerably because of it, and maybe well before it happens.

You think a larger blocksize was a change to the original Bitcoin?  How long have you been in crypto?


So there are no LN transactions in the blocks I send transactions in, if I don't want to use it?
And EDA hasn't been a thing since November, genius.  Are your talking points really that outdated?  It's funny that you're calling other people's arguments horseshit.

I haven't posted here in a long time, I just checked in for Vegeta memes, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  But historically, some users of specifically BTC maximalists, are very anti-BCH and have no problem with using smear tactics or attempts at censorship to sway the conversation (looking at you, I'm not saying that BCH is completely free of scandals, as I own some of both coins.  Both sides would profit greatly from the hashrate flipping/staying on their side, as Bitcoin/crypto is destined for greatness, so I'm not surprised that people fight dirty over this.  However, I think that censorship is always wrong, promotes ignorance, and runs completely counter to many of the principles of cryptocurrency that drew investors in the first place.
I think it's great that BCH allowed the miners who were advocating for blocksize increase to have their peace, *and* that Lightning Network is finally panning out to be the fee reduction that some people were hoping for.  The fair market is going to decide this battle though, using these kinds of tactics just makes all of the crypto scene look bad.

Isn't Change.org meant for political petitions?  I haven't seen much private sector activism on there.

If the Bitcoin title follows the longest chain, you may want to check how many blocks have been mined on BCH...
Guess BTC is an altcoin lol.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:40:42
This is getting sad lol.  You realize both are Bitcoin, right?  BTC is actually farther from real Bitcoin after Segwit and LN.

How is it appropriating the name Bitcoin?  It's in its name, and "Bitcoin" is really just a title for the chain with the highest hashrate.  It's not trademark infringement, it's inherent in its definition.  Have you read the whitepaper?
