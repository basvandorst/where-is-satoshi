Glad you asked this question. What happened, is that the bank claims that the insurance by the Brazilian Confederation Olympic athletes is for competition and Lais Souza was not in competition, was in training for the Olympic games in Sochi, should secure your place in Olympic games a few days later. You can have more information here about the bank and the Brazilian Confederation Olimpica:

She had no medical insurance because was training not in competition. She had traveled on their own, with the coach of Brazilian Olympic Committee, probably this trip has been paid for with private sponsorships. The Brazilian Olympic Committee has assumed the costs of hospitalization in USA, Laisa still in Miami, almost 2 months by now. But when she get to Brazil, this aid will end once she did not participate in competition and had no insurance.

Thanks for the suggestion wcastello. I've updated the post making clear that no fees, and the name was also used to give more confidence the campaign, since he is a personality in the Bitcoin community here in Brazil, the intention is to help Lais and generate free buzz for Bitcoin not for marketing any type of exchange. Now I hope it was clear, Thanks for the donation!
