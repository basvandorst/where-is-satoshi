i thought i took a photo of it.. but when i go to load the seed with the words i have save it says no transactions for this wallet
@_date: 2014-12-22 07:58:33
then my money dissapears and i close electrum, reopen it and it's all sitting there again.

really have no idea how this even happened ive been a bit drowsy all day but i didn't think i was THAT out of it that i could fuck this up after countless transactions going so smoothly in the past.. i suppose i got complacent. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 09:03:41
i'm actually not, that's the fucked up bit.

i ask because i try to send it with nothing in the password field and hit ok and the window closes but doesn't say it's invalid like the password i know i would of saved.

Yeah i was stressing out trying to do multiple things at once and now i'm stressed out even more.

so if i cant touch it... can my friend get it back??? or is it just stuck in my useless wallet forever
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:59:49
Is there anyway to contact the electrum team?

No. When i enter the seed i have saved it disappears ( i think this seed is for another wallet?) so i close it and then reopen electrum and my BTC is back, but i can't send it anywhere because i have no password/seed. Is is possible i save my password as nothing?
