Lol. That's not how markets work. Markets work because the companies people invest in create value over time and people buy and sell instantaneous valuations of that. People can keep spending around 5% more per year for GE because GE has consistently made about 5% more earnings per year. At times people overpay and lose money, or underpay and make money, but the market itself is a mechanism for transferring wealth to the future. Bitcoin has no inherent value that it creates, yet it takes massive amounts of money to keep it functioning. 
If all you could do was hold 1 bitcoin, it would do literally nothing for you. If all you could do was hold one share of GE, you'd be sent money that they've made every year.

Supposedly bitcoin is a currency. You don't "invest" in dollars or euros or yen or w/e currency you want to mention. Bitcoin itself doesn't do anything productive. Why should you make money by holding it?
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:28:27
Except he's right... bitfinex does about 4mil per day and bitstamp does about 2mil in btc. This attack would cost ~$100,000 per day to force people to reconsider the default transaction fee. Even assume it takes $1mil per day, that's still a drop in the bucket in the total volume done on the exchanges. And meanwhile bitcoin becomes completely useless so you add in the factor of people trying (and possibly unable to) get rid of their bitcoin, I doubt such an attack would increase the price.

The main and currently entirely destructive problem is there can only be 2.7 transactions per second. So if it ever is used by the world, you'll get one transaction every roughly 100 years (and that assumes no population growth). At best it can be a small group of people who use it.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:28:17
So basically you're saying it's not related. By the same logic, you could publish about anything. Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat, I got a new job which gives me fiat.

250 is not a low enough level. Here's a picture of when that happened with a stock that basically had a buywall.

No it seems he requested to be charged for one ticked and a page showed up saying: "please try again later". He then tried again 6 times. The same could have happened with bitcoin.

If there truly are people who believe in the fundamental value of bitcoin then it should get harder to move the price the further down it goes and make it easier to go upwards. 
And what you say is theoretically possible in any market, which is why everyone who complains about stocks going down complain about "manipulators". Doesn't matter if it's BABA, TSLA, bitcoin, random penny stock. People apparently have enough money to pin for option expiration, drive prices up or down, keep prices stable, as long as they have money they can completely manipulate the market (and make money while doing so). The only requirement for "manipulators" to appear is the price of the asset is going against you.

@_date: 2015-03-18 03:01:46
Yes but you don't have to mine blocks to use the money, so the printing money is irrelevant to the cost of the transaction. In this case it is a direct causal relation.
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:19:12

@_date: 2015-03-18 03:06:21
The problem is that those costs are what the miners need to keep running. Once bitcoins stop being mined, the transaction costs will have to keep up, otherwise miners will fold and the whole network will become more and more exposed to a 51% attack.

@_date: 2015-03-18 03:08:57
If the price of bitcoin stays high while miners drop out of the network it becomes worthwhile to try a 51% attack. If bitcoins are worth pennies no one is really gonna care. The lower the network transaction cost (which most certainly includes the bitcoins given out), the fewer miners who can keep up.
Edit: Also I just realized. Do you think the price of gold has nothing to do with the miners? If gold miners all of a sudden got really efficient at mining gold (obviously not a direct example), do you think the price of gold would change? How about if all the gold miners decided to stop mining gold? Would the actions of the miners and the gold they get effect the price of gold?
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:42:36

Because you are believing in the money system? No you are just sitting on your ass with your money doing nothing. Merchants have already run into this problem. No one actually uses bitcoin. The vast majority of people just hold it with dreams of getting rich. Imagine if this were the only currency:
The super rich save most of their bitcoin. The poor are forced to use it. This sends demand for bitcoin higher which increases the price so the rich save more of it. This screws over the poor who now have to do more to get the same amount of bitcoin. 
However, the poor will also be saving as much bitcoin as possible. This also takes bitcoin of the money supply. Investment will drop in  anything outside of bitcoin. This leads to a spiral of job loss and yet more pressure on the poor to use all their bitcoin while the rich can save.
What stops that spiral of the rich getting richer by holding bitcoin and the poor getting poorer by being forced to actually use it?

Well that crash was very underwhelming. Should I set another alarm?

If btc were better sure. But it solves no problems. It's expensive for microtransactions, has a cap on the number of times it can be used per second, adds to global warming, is complex to use. The benefits are... it can be used for illegal things?

Well usually not on the secondary market. If Buffett really did try to just market sell all his shares the price probably would hit 0 (or get the exchange to halt the stock some of the way down). Maybe some algos run some kind of fundamental analysis and would realize that the shares are selling for like .25*book value and just pick up as much as they can but not actually sure.

So the only way bitcoin will be useful as a deflationary currency is if every other currency fails?

Do you really believe this? The price stayed above the bearwhale's price for 3 months before dying. Bitcoin's price dropping had nothing to do with the bearwhale.

It's hard because you have no idea what you're talking about
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:47:40
Ok so then you agree. The only use for bitcoin is doing things which are currently illegal.
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:15:41
No there's a steady stream. Just check @_date: 2015-03-08 02:58:28
Not exactly. Let's say you were holding a 30 year bond right now and inflation spikes. You may get much more out of TIPS than that bond just because of how low the yield is right now.

You still didn't mention how you came to that conclusion. Or give any kind of time frame

So then there are ways to use money in ways the government and banks don't profit? 
What's the use of bitcoin again other than illegal things and holding them as some kind of "investment" in which you hope people buy other bitcoins for a higher price (because they hope other people buy more bitcoins for a yet higher price)?

Don't people realize he wrote this 5 days before the top and his plan involved getting rich based on bitcoin doubling 10 times? If you put (as he recommended) 80% of your liquid assets into bitcoin you would now be worth 36% of what you were worth back then. Hopefully few people actually followed his plan.

What are those mathematical reasons? If it has no use there's no mathematics about it...

You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. An exchange is not a market maker. You definitely didn't even read your own link. Why are the two markets you mention linked? How does depressing the price in one market lower the price in the other? And why doesn't it rise when you buy in the other market?

escrow bitcoin. So you lose the speed, the anonymity, the decentralization, for... for... bitcoin?

I came from a reference from a bestoff of a broke forex trader who refused to believe he was a gambler. All the same signs, I need to,make the money back quickly. Can someone give me a surefire way to invest to get it back etc etc

Even worse than saying he incinerated $410,000 is he somehow managed to achieve -60% returns on his "investments"
