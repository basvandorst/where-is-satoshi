Good luck with that. Nara Sushi is about the only decent place I've found and it's just not that great.

SR was definitely a fascinating social experiment, but not as some legal ish utopia for the libertarian crypto anarchistic cypherpunk contingent. Really though.. How much more attention could SR possibly receive? Gawker first  popped it 'mainstream', Carnegie Mellon did a research paper that made it top of mind for the Senate and FBI dogooders and injected the legend into counter/pop culture almost from jump street. For a couple years it was the perfect platform for pimply faced dungeon masters, for wanna be cool kids, for cryptonerds and twitterdorks everywhere.  Outrageously overpriced, dangerous, and potentially lethal hard drugs made readily  available AND delivered right to anyone's doorstep.  Shopping on the  'darknet' message boards and  'pseudo anonymous' ebay style websites made the experience of getting ripped off for psychedelics so much easier and certainly sounded more menacing  than going to the Meadow in Central Park  and getting sold fake perforated blotter paper without having to spend time mingling with -or worse yet- 'fraternizing' - with low class denzien/ dangerous merchants on the street. That kind of material almost writes itself and sells mucho copies, so it wasn't long before Forbes, the Economist, Entrepeneur,  NYT, et al started weighing in. Funny thing is technology didn't take down SR. Old fashioned detective work ultimately closed in on the infamous DPR who had made a number of sloppy amateur mistakes in the beginning and then grew arrogant enough to believe that he was an actual gangster close to the end. Either that or he left himself a wide open target for a massive alphabet agency frame up.
