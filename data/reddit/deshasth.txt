Waitin' eagerly mate! Though sure it's not gonna drop much.

I think you're right. Even if whales pump and dump the price will still go up because lots of new money is coming in the market constantly, from all around the world. Encouraging it's adoption is the one way to ensure that the price always shoots up and not down.

Is it the Frankfurt airport?

Yes, this is important to remember.

Things like this is the reason I got into Crypto in the first place. They're only losing their business and making people aware why banks suck.

Now imagine if Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Ecuador (which uses USD &amp; not their own currency) &amp; almost any country with economic problems started doing this. How good those countries would do without a central bank regulating their currency. That's the potential of this system. 
Wish you the best.

Being new to this all &amp; since I hate fiat currency &amp; banksters, I'm not that much concerned about humanity but I like crypto in general. I like what you're doing! Keep it up bud

Very good bot!

It tanked before the projected date. People were saying it will tank after three months I.e. after reaching 10k. B2X caused this all &amp; those who shorted BTC, they'd be making some now. Not really sure whether this was a coup by Jihan's team or the NYA team. It's kinda weird though.

That's not what I meant. From an investor viewpoint, this fall is unexpected that's all. It happened too soon, though this was completely expected after S2X.

You aren't considering the important part there: the money. Linux is free, sure it has utility but your investment in it is not as strong as it is in case of bitcoin. Your analogy is not completely inaccurate, however this is lot more serious than making your own distro that suits your requirements.

I got Pizza from PJ once &amp; smelled like literal piss. IDK, I don't trust that brand. I'd rather buy from Dominos or PH. It's cheap Pizza with bad quality not a value deal. You'd be paying less but losing on the quality.

It says "it", I think Disgusting is a genderfluid transperson. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:15:37
I guess something must be wrong with that particular store then. Honestly, never had much problem with PJ Pizzas from other shops.

You're right in a way since more and more people are buying it nowadays. Anything that people use to "buy" anything is a currency and thus, with right strategy, bitcoin can truly pose a challenge to modern day fiat currencies.

No guarantee of that these days &amp; I'm talking about real education like STEM &amp; not the liberal arts.

No doubt it's being pumped. Ironically they accuse BCH of being a pump and dump scheme!

Hmm I have been trying to implement a platform to do exactly this since last year. Although the major hurdle is how would you make sure the investor gets the returns? How would you go about the legal process to grant this African guy his equity? How can he ask for the dividends if you start screwing him up from US (in this hypothetical case)? If it's loaned, how can he collect interests?
It's not easy at it sounds. If you have a solution on these problems, hit me up. Because people are trying from allover the world to make sustainable equity crowdfunding platforms but the industry is still not booming as much in third world. What you said works best only in UK &amp; EU. It's still nascent in US &amp; seen as too risky in other parts of the world.
