What? Any source?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:27:40
I had the same situation and got my winnings later. Support told me that it was score provider fault. Maybe you should check your wallet again ...

That's the actual question I was supposed to answer for my friend and I fear I came out short. What are the real advantages that can be used to advertise it to people?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:54:08
how? I don't get it. IF there is no decision it means "no" ... 
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:57:56
Thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:06:45

@_date: 2016-02-08 10:06:17

@_date: 2017-10-26 10:09:29
