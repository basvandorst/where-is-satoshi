Being a landlord is a great soutce of income, especially when you can do most of the work/ maintenance yourself.
Keep that property. You cant lose.

Best bet for sure! My dollar cost average is 6500 so far but i can see thats going to swing much higher soon.

If i drove a zamboni, my life would probably be more exciting, actually

Amen. I was so awkward around children and never wanted one in my 20's. Now that im mid 30's and have a daughter i appreciate kids and can talk to them so easily. Having your own changes you completely.

Nice timing!

That's a very great write up. Thank you.

4500, 6500, 8000b etc. All when the current prices were about 500 more. My expectations about it fluctuating that much have always failed.

If you think it's going to 3k again you're gonna be waiting. Maybe 5-6k would be a better number. 
Investing in shitcoins is bad advice.

Banks take your money, promise they will have that money on demand when you need to withdrawal, and use the money for their own investments; loans.
An exchange is a bank. Thwy're not going away. They will adapt.

Didnt they just get caught for phishing info?
Edit: sorry guys. It was a trezor immitator that managed to get their app on google play.

Awesome! I'll make the upgrade to coinbase pro since they already have all my info. I'll read up on bitstamp.

Ill have to free up some space on my phone and download a different browser. The dropdown function to buy/sell isnt working correctly on my android/chrome browser on the pro website for some reason at the moment. 
I see deposits and withdraws between coinbase and pro are free so i can buy on pro and get them all to the same place before i transfer to a cold wallet. :). I just wish pro had an app because i need to make that buy asap when i get an alert that prices have dropped to a certain level

Nice! I want to get there. I bought $100 worth in january and didnt even realize i hit a great spot to buy. Its almost doubled itself. I wish i had more than .026. I'm waiting for it to drop before i buy more but that might not happen any time soon.

Oops, sorry. I was skimming. Apparently a fake app on google play was imitating trezor.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:32:55
Currently, yes. Im out of town 4 or 5 days a week so i rely on mobile
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:40:54
I think that's a good plan.
Edit: omg it just keeps climbing. I have a little bit of money in BAT and XLM that i got for free and those seem like they might have a future with their development but they're doing nothing right now. Maybe i should forget about them and convert to BTC
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:04:48
Thats the impression i got too. Theyre treating it more like stock and you'd have to cash out and buy elsewhere to actually own the btc. I dont want that!
