it's just humor, homes.
neither i nor anyone else can prognosticate about what's going to happen with the cryptocurrencies (and i derive a small amount of amusement from deflating self-appointed oracles.). i have various *bets* and those *bets* are *hedged*. i'm a freelance hacker (my hedge) and I work as much as possible in the bitcoin space (my bet).

look into Salt and NaCl. they have reasonable defaults for people who don't do security regularly.

Well said.
I still advise to build a long position in BC. Ignore daily fluctuations and (see snakemcgraw's comment) trade the fundamentals.
Idiots who make "investments" in this space and then bite their nails over every move are trading on their emotions and likely to hand their money over to humans less owned by their reptilian brains.

The collpasing value of the USD has probably killed any chance of it being accepted in modern transactions.
It's looking far too frail, and the discovery by the governing bodies of the USG that they can issue more "dollars" at will will depress the market and drive a flight to safety into other currencies. I personally wouldn't accept the United States Dollar in my business any more than I'd accept gold; it's too rooted in tradition and burdened with bureaucratic ossification (on the governmental side) to survive technological disruption.
I think it's fine as a fiat currency for debt-slaves and worshippers of the American Empire, but I personally wouldn't use it in business unless someone could guarantee (to my persnickety standards) that the number of dollars in circulation wasn't subject to political manipulation.
