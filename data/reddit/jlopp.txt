No. More precisely, some malicious people want a chainsplit, or at least to kick out some competing miners, whether through a contentious hard fork or through a minority soft fork. No other reason to insist on such destructive fork mechanisms, rather than focus on the features themselves (i.e. increase in capacity). For the good of Bitcoin we should never help such destructive fork efforts.

After some BIP148ers begged the SW2X team to save their rear ends from the chain split and subsequent oblivion, they responded. The response was to change some BIP91 parameters such that it would be possible, assuming no significant delay in the schedule, favorable luck in the finding of blocks, no miner withdrawing from the agreement, and lenience from all of the signatory miners towards the BIP148ers, to force SegWit activation by the same method as BIP148 (orphaning) before the BIP148 deadline, but crucially, with 80% of the miners promising enforcement, thus avoiding a split. It can possibly happen, but it is far from guaranteed. It depends on the combined will and abilities of all people involved, it even depends on the actions of third parties (e.g. potential new miners), and it also depends on chance.
It is quite disgusting to see how the BIP148ers inconsistently appear to oppose the equally disgraceful SW2X fork only to then seek rescue from their own irresponsibility in the same SW2X.
We could have gone about activating SegWit in a much better and uneventful way. Like with the activation threshold reduced to the same 80% in a better way than BIP91 and without all the politics and horse trading, which are practices contrary to the nature of the Bitcoin community.
