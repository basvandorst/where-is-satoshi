Ah! They are averaging transaction costs. Which seems valid, but again it is an average. Some people might want to pay a high premium to get there transaction in faster and some transactions have lots of inputs that makes them much more expensive than average. Median values would be more useful than averages.
In my case the $1.3 USD cost per Kb comes from looking up my transaction in a block explorer. The fee rate for **my transaction** was 0.0001509473684210526 BTC per kB \($1.13 USD\)

Citadel outlet.
The 10&amp; sales tax is paid regardless of the payment method.
The expectation is that in the future the price of BTC will be much more stable. And, if the laws remain the way they are today, your capital gains would be a few cents or a couple dollars for a big transaction. So, 20&amp; of that would be negligible.

True, if you are trading for profit.
Spending BTC is how you can help make it become more common place. If more people want to spend it, more stores will accept it, if more businesses want it then its value raises. I know that spending my valuable BTC is not an efficient financial move at the moment. But, I would like to think that it strengthens and legitimizes the technology. I'm willing to pay the price.
In the long term I'll be skipping some fiat "gains", but theoretically whatever BTC I have left will be more valuable faster because more people is transacting with it.

I estimated my transaction size to be somewhere around 100 bytes because it was very simple and small. \(single input and two outputs\) For it to be 250 bytes would seem fine too, if I had multiple inputs for the transaction and more than two outputs.
So, if 1000 bytes is about $1.3 USD and 1000b/250b = 4, then the transaction cost would be $1.3/4 = $0.325 USD
With my original guess\-timate 1000b/100b = 10, $1.3/10 = $0.13
Got to remember that an average of 250b per transaction means you can have the following transaction sizes: 100b, 100b, 200b, 600b; average 250b

Yes, just the wallet in your phone. You'll scan the QR code they have by the register machine.

I believe so.

For completeness, they also accept Litecoin, they had the QR for it at the counter.

Yeah, I threw the ticket AND a camera, with a timer set, into the air at the same time ;D

Confirmation was fast. Not instant like with a credit card, but not long enough to make me go "ugh, never again". 
The fee rate was 0.0001509473684210526 BTC per kB \(\~$1.3 USD per kB\) Of course my transaction size was not a full kB, about a tenth of that. So it cost \~$0.13 USD Very cheap.

Plenty, the discount was about $37 USD. Transaction fees for a very big transaction \(1Kb\) would have been around $1.3 USD, it was less than that.

Where? What direction from LAX?
