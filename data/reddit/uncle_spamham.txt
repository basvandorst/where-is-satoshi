It is a scam by luring ordinary people in hopes of getting a return on their investment, when in reality most of them lose money.

Then stop shilling the coin to ordinary people. The whole disgusting part about this is luring people in to take their money.

Thank you for agreeing with me.

The scam part of it is that there is a concerted effort to lure retail investors into the market and take their money when the 30% to 40% drops occur. You hear about bitcoin in the news and in social media being pushed to regular people who do not belong in this current market.

Lets look at the overall picture. The whales use this market as a tool to increase their return on investment. The retail investors also want to use this market to increase their return on investment. But the whale has the advantage to move the price and is better prepared to take actions not only to protect their investment but increase it. A retail investor can only take action to protect their investment. In a free market dominated by greed, who will win? Not the retail investor.

By reading this comment you just wasted my time, I will ignore your future comments.

The system is a scam when there are bad apples that do bad things and get away with it.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:40:21
We have no argument, we both agree that there is a scam WHEN there are bad apples that manipulate the price of bitcoin.

The scam nature of bitcoin can be shown by its $1000 price increase on April 2nd in just 2 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:30:35
You have a flawed argument. Falls in line with "Attack the user and not the argument"
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:07:14


We have no argument, we both agree that "bitcoin should not be used as an investment. It’s very high risk and the price is really unknown still"
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:28:23
Useless comment

You stated the relationship of merchants and retailers by saying "Either the retail investor uses a merchant processor where they auto convert the BTC to fiat" This whole argument has been against scamming retail investors. The nature of your recent replies seem to boil down to disinformation and ad hominem I may ignore your future comments.

We have no argument. We have a mutual understanding that bitcoin is a scam WHEN there are bad apples that manipulate the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:12:25
It is the intent of manipulating the price of bitcoin in order to take from others that is a scam. I have no doubt its happening with bitcoin.

Name calling falls in line with "attacking the user, not the argument" not going to work here
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:32:18
You seem more involved in that space than me, why don't you do it for me?
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:12:37
"Attack the user and not the argument" isn't going to work here. Do I need to point out that bitcoin fell from 19000 to 6000 in 45 days. A 60% drop in price and who got fucked! The retail investors. When ordinary users get 60% of their money stolen from them if thats not a scam, WHAT IS A SCAM?

There's no need to take this argument of "attacking the user" If you want to distract from the actual argument, that is what you would do.
"Bitcoin is what it is and if you don't actually know what that is, don't gamble with it." That is what should only be headlined in the news and social media. Unfortunately that is not the case.
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:25:00
The flaw in your argument is that you believe the  market is fair to all participants simply because they can all exit into fiat and protect their investments. If that were true then bitcoin would go to 0 because every prudent participant would sell when bitcoin falls. You may say that "its the investors responsibility to take action." But as we have seen there are new players coming into the market pushed by the news and media to lure them in and take their money.
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:58:23
This doesn't do anything to progress the argument, waste of time.
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:52:15
The whales are aware of the power they have to move the price. Look at the chart history of bitcoin where there are regular 30 to 40% drops. Bad apples use this to their advantage to sell and buy at lower prices. The scam part of it is that there is a concerted effort to lure retail investors into the market and take their money when the 30 to 40% drops occur. We can both agree, this is not a market for retail investors.
