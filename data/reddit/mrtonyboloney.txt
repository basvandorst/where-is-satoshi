I’m still using this as a wallet...
What’s the best way to move on? Is GDAX okay?

There is no universal “price” of bitcoin. The prices you see on Google when you type “BTC to USD” is determined by averages of exchange sites. The “price” is, in essence, determined by an average of the most recent transactions.
Ex: If in the past hour, there was 100 bitcoins purchased, on an exchange website, for $1,000,000 USD total. From that, the website can give an approximate value to bitcoin.  1,000,000 / 100 = $10,000 USD per BTC.
The volatility of bitcoin is due to price updates often happening every minute, or even faster. GDAX takes into account the most recent transaction to give a price for the market.
Quite literally, Bitcoin’s worth as much as people are willing to pay for it (how much someone recently paid is the precedent for most exchange services). When plenty of people are buying Bitcoin, but not as many people are selling their coins, the value of Bitcoin goes up because the supply of bitcoins (amount of people willing to sell) can’t keep up with the demand (amount of people who want to buy).
Because of limited supply, sellers can get away with selling their BTC for a higher price, which drives up the universal worth of bitcoin.
The opposite is true when plenty are selling their coins, but few want to buy them. Because of this, dramatic drops in price are often a causal loop that leads to more people panic-selling, and further drops in price.

He may be a nonbeliever, but we still have things in common. :P

So why didn't they just update GDAX to that UI? I don't see the point of this change unless they were turning a profit by limiting functionality or something... The only confusion I see that they might be trying to clear up is the lack of Coinbase branding under GDAX.

Yeah, but “Pro” makes it seem like a paid service to me. If they were gonna unify the brand, I feel it should just be one Coinbase with more capabilities.

That’s what I’m wondering.

I HODL because I’m a hoarder, but I like to keep things clean...

Can someone explain to me how one would develop a fork for a preexisting cryptocurrency (specially BTC and BCH)?
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:45:46
Dude same... My transaction is going to take another 4 business days &gt;_&gt;

What’s a bull trap?
