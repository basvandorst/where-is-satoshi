Yeah, but what is the incentive to make it? I agree with what you are saying, but it would be hard to replicate the success of bitcoin in something like Airbnb. The middleman adds a lot of value(advertising, brand building, handling disputes, other areas). Hard for me to see them going away. Again, what is the incentive to build it?

Yeah. Except that really isn’t how it works.

He always gets tech wrong, missing the run ups in IBM and Apple. He is Luddite to some degree. A great accountant, but not tech savvy.

Zactly. There is no Madoff in bitcoin so it is a stupid analogy.

You go to foldapp.com and buy prepaid cards for amazon, Starbucks, etc with btc. You get a cash back rewards around 10% to 20% in btc. It is a nice way to get some Satoshis for stuff you buy anyway.

Is that what is meant by “cold storage”?

No they don’t on coffee. Urban people in SF and LA and NYC, where all the coffee places are all rich. If you don’t understand that it is because you aren’t one of them.
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:33:17
Life experience. I know a lot of business owners and in fact am one. It is retarded to complain about 3% interchange on coffee. No one cares what coffee costs. First Starbucks charged $2, the. Peets $3, then Blue Bottle $4 and now Philz charges $5.50 and there is a 20 minute queue to get one. If a coffee shop is this stupid, they deserve poverty. Just raise your prices, no one cares.

I don’t know anything about UK banking, but know US banking. 
Banks in the US would do this if they are initiating ACH transfers to Coinbase, and those outbound ACH are turning up in large numbers to be fraudulent. The reason, the bank that initiates the ACH transfer is the one on the hook for fraud. If criminals are stealing consumer credentials and sending a lot of ACHs to Coinbase, then Coinbase would be toast, as I can see the banks saying “no mas”.

Foldapp.com is cool
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:29:17
I don’t get it either. It is just like stocks. I have a friend that loses all his money every year on a different stock with a $50M cap.

I know right? It is like the movie “it’s a wonderful life”, but the Bailey Building and Loan is the catalyst for BTC.

I always thought those stories about Pablo Escobar’s cash being eaten by rats were BS, but maybe not.

He can made a legitimate claim as G.O.A.T.

I would think a scam would be, “we can get you a position from up to three days ago cause w have this MIT computer science guy who figured it out”

I don’t buy that sign. It is 3 % and you no longer have to lug cash to the bank and worry about getting robbed or losing it. 
Your customers demand demand use of electronic payment cause cash is a pain in the ass to get. It is an extra chore.
What this sign really says to me is, “I don’t want to pay taxes”.

I would ask them if they are building any cool shit, like Tony Stark does. They probably are.

I don’t see it working.
The thing they gets me, is I have spent a lot of time working in Africa, even places as remote as Rwanda, where i spent a few months not too long ago, pre BTC.
I could buy anything I wanted in Rwanda in US dollars. So my point is that there already is a fiat solution to shitty currencies in third world countries and it is called USD. BTC is different cause it isn’t fiat. Libre is fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-12 22:02:29
You can’t have a “bank account” in USD in Rwanda. If you want to go 100% cash and keep it in a mattress, you could just do USD.
You don’t want a bank account in Rwanda francs either....look at the chart vs USD. Brutal

People are mostly stupid regarding math. If they weren’t, there would be no credit card industry or McMansions.
