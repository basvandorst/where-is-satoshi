If everybody needed an entire copy of the blockchain just to use or accept bitcoin, it would be a pretty lousy piece of technology.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:05:07
80gb is totally untenable on a phone. I think wires are getting crossed here.. if bitcoin is not usable unless you have a computer on you then there are some serious problems not being addressed. Of course, this isn't true, and people have been happily and safely uaing spv wallets for a really long time now.

If you think that bigger blocks leading to centralization, from your node's point of view, is bad, then I assume you are potentially in favor of a block size decrease. Surely 1mb isn't some magic number that's perfectly decentralized.
If you think 1mb is decentralized enough, then it's not hard to imagine the tradeoffs for 2mb, or 4mb.
That's the thing with decentralization. There are millions of people who can't afford to run a 1mb node. Should we cater to them and decrease the block size? Or should we allow growth based on demand?
It's not easy question, but whatever it is, 1mb is not the exact number.

Put aside for a moment all the shills and people who make emotional or thin arguments, there are plenty of intelligent, technically minded people who have wanted Bitcoin to scale differently then the way it is being done now. It's basically impossible that Bitcoin is scaling in exactly the perfect way right now.
Many of these people were fans of XT / Classic / Unlimited and now Cash, simply because it offers an alternative -- one that has been desired for at least three years. 
Maybe the current Bitcoin is going to stay as decentralized as it is (which isn't very much considering China basically does all the mining), but I'm not convinced. We should all be happy about the competition.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:32:40
I guess I just don't see what point you're trying to make by saying Bitcoin would never be rolled back. It would and it did, and it would happen again under different circumstances. Nobody would care for a bitcoin blockchain where 90% of coins were in a known attackers account. The community would rise up and patch it, probably creating two chains just like Eth.
There's no sense in comparing the specific differences with Eth and Bitcoin here, the philosophy isn't that different.
Hate on Eth all you want, but the ability for people to come together when shit hits the fan is a good thing. I'm glad it happened early in Eth's timeline. Many important lessons were learned from that. It's not like the Eth community is hellbent on rewriting history everytime something like this happens.

@_date: 2018-01-15 22:15:09


But this is obviously false based on what I just said. Even 1mb blocks is too much for certain people to operate nodes. Furthermore "maximum" decentralization doesn't mean a thing. It's that kind of rhetoric which makes this conversation so challenging.
We can judge "adequate" decentralization by having a good grasp on all the minimum requirements to enter the system as different players: miners, nodes, businesses, wallet devs, core devs. The minimum requirements to enter any and all of those systems is what makes a decentralized system and it will never be maxed out.

Yes it's [right in the conclusion](
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:48:16
The paper doesn't include a timeline, but the reason why it needs bigger blocks at all, and why the paper mentions this, is because there needs to be room in blocks to open and close channels otherwise the security model is compromised. Bitcoin blocks are completely full right now, so for Lightning Network to work without being subject to timing attacks, "now" is actually 10 months ago.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:16:57
you are confusing eth with something like iota. eth is a blockchain like bitcoin (albeit a much more complex / advanced blockchain)
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:22:30
Contracts require a certain amount of "gas" to execute instructions. When you send a transaction you include gas, similar to a transaction fee, which is depleted as instructions are run. It's not a common problem though since its simple to calculate minimum gas amounts.

It's an incredibly interesting philosophical question about community, society, that share a public ledger. "What combination of exceptional circumstances, technical and societal, will result in a successful reorganization of historical events."
Although very different circumstances, both the bitcoin bug and the dao hack are situations where people came together to make a difficult decision and "rewrite history". Personally I find this to be a beautiful example of human collaboration, particularly the Dao fork. We *can* unite to fight for common causes even if they break a fundamental rule we originally made.

@_date: 2017-12-31 08:04:51
It does not discourage people to spend their coins! In fact when prices are at all time highs, purchases with bitcoin rise dramatically since people have more purchasing power.
At the end of the day people need stuff to live and they are willing to exchange money for it, no matter what that money is. Bitcoin is still a grand experiment, so it may turn out to have been a bad idea, but the hard limit is essential to its current value proposition.

@_date: 2017-12-31 07:22:38
Well then it would be a completely different system. There are some coins that inflate forever, but Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary over the long run. The inflation schedule was designed to promote distribution. Generally speaking, I think that part of the system has been going well.

You might want to reconsider your comments here... not exactly good PR for your company.

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:28


That logic seems tragically ironic. In order to prevent competition from high fees caused by spam we'll just raise the fees ourself.
Anyways.. what you're saying would be true if the blocksize was determined by, and only by, the max limit. You could have 100mb blocks and miners would set the limit to whatever's economical for them.
Cryptolution, let's just agree to disagree. I'm sceptical that you and I will find middle ground, but I'll keep trying if you want.

It's catching on fast. While there are people who pull their smart phones out to pay for things at the counter, the real convenience is skipping the PoS altogether. Order from the app, pickup at the store. Most of the McDonald's in the states have those tablet ordering machines now for the same reason. It's not cash which is inefficient, it's the entire lineup + customer interaction part that is. Doing things electronically can save businesses lots of money, as well as saving customers time.

@_date: 2017-12-25 20:47:29
So you're mistaken about the roadmap, which is not to indefinitely increase block size. A lot of people think lightning needs segwit but that's not true either, as it can be built with a different malleability fix.
Bitcoin Cash roadmap includes layer two solutions as well. It's really not a nefarious short-sighted project that some people think it is, it's just taking a different path to scaling which includes business / consumer adoption in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:49:18
[The published roadmap doesn't go that far]( but from discussions I've seen and from the people involved, its picking up from where core's disagreement created the main split 2 years ago. (Hearn, Gavin, vs Greg, Peter, Luke, Matt et al).
If you look at the scaling debate on bitcointalk and mailing lists from about 3 - 4 years ago most core devs were fairly evenly positioned. A modest block size increase and offchain solutions for micropayments. Most of the discussion was focused on how to upgrade and minimize the risk.
In [this interview]( with Mike Hearn he describes how Satoshi drew a "line in the sand" where onchain and offchain scaling meet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:15:25
The BitcoinABC client is the most popular BCH client at the moment and it has an 8mb limit in the code, to go over that would require a hard fork unless another client which has even bigger blocks takes over the majority.
It was really easy to tell when bitcoin blocks were gonna hit the 1mb limit and for that reason the serious discussion of how to increase the block size started years in advance. I, like many others, felt a hard fork with a year lead up time would have been plenty to have minimal disruption and I think the BCH / Ethereum forks have been largely successful (not the DAO one, of course). That being said, expect many more hard forks in Bitcoin Cash for many reasons, not just block size.
edit: regarding gb+ block testing.. it will be ages until we reach block sizes that big. I wish we would be able to tell how big bitcoin blocks would actually be right now. my guess is between 3 - 4mb
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:34:40
This is hashrate distribution in Bitcoin right now: 
Having more full nodes is great, but even 50 million nodes around the world can't stop a few big pools from joining forces and owning more than half the network, undermining the entire value proposition. 
I'm not saying it's a good thing, but it's not as secure as you're saying. For now, let's be happy that miners don't want to screw themselves over along with everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:45:41
If you hold onto your analogy as-is, then bitcoin is also centralized simply due to mining centralization. That's why there are non-mining nodes &amp; lightning because bitcoin *is* centralized.
Of course that's a terribly naive way to look at things. Centralization, like safety, is on a continuum, not a light switch.
edit: also you can make comments about what camp you think I'm in, but you'd be wrong. I would be more careful about when to discuss and when to be a dick to trolls.

I'm not saying they should be praised, but absolutely not vilified.
If it wasn't possible / potentially profitable for miners to switch chains on their own accord then there would be no bitcoin in the first place.

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:03:46
To put this another way... if you think security and decentralized are more important than everything else then you should be in favor for a PoW change.
But if you do that, then the price of Bitcoin will tank and probably never come back up while alts fill in the space, making the added security worthless.
So sacrifices need to be made and are being made right now. It's always going to be a balancing act.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:35:14
Well, basically every crypto community is more comfortable with hard forks than bitcoin. I think segwit would have been a much better solution as a hard fork, but whatever. 
I don't believe that hard forks are any more likely to cause a schism than soft forks. It's just a different way of doing something similar. If the code changes are contentious then it will be still cause a divide--for exactly that reason I think hard forks are better so as to make a clean split between the divided factions. Hopefully future proposals won't cause as much of a divide as the blocksize debate has caused. I mean, hopefully there won't be any actual forks at any point, just normal scheduled updates.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:06:57

You *could* say that, but I think you would be wrong. Miners have the biggest investment in bitcoin out of everyone. Their entire businesses rely on bitcoin having value so they're extremely risk averse to software changes.
If the developers and the community at large didn't have such a big disagreement about stuff then miners would probably feel more comfortable upgrading to new software, but they're not gonna risk it while the rest of the community is still figuring out what the best thing to do is.

Again I disagree.. scarcity is as important as any other property of good money.

How much security is worth sacrificing for more adoption? I think it's a toss up. A lot of people call Bitcoin Cash insecure / centralized but it's working fairly well so far. There's a lot of money at stake if it can be successfully attacked.

That's the part of the discussion that seems to have been forgotten. People talk about lightning and layer 2 for things like coffee, but this discussion has been around a lot longer then both segwit and BCH, its just that the domains were different. Layer two was looked at for very small payments like subcent type of things. No one really expected fees to be high enough to consider coffee to be worthy of layer two.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:51:58
I think you're way off, from everything I've seen in Eth development. Also this same attack vector could happen with Bitcoin and a prominent developer like Greg Maxwell, someone who core devs largely trust.

Well... it's not like a successful 51% attack gains you that much.

I think [this graph]( of number of confirmed transactions plainly shows the opposite of what you're saying. It's entirely predictable within some margin of error to see how quickly blocks will fill up and in my opinion it was irresponsible to allow fees to reach these levels this quickly. 
I think it would have been much more responsible to ease into the fee market as the block subsidy go does.

Did Coinbase have a lot of options here? Segwit, or what? I mean.. they can disagree with that scaling solution and still complain about fees. They're not responsible for high fees. You could argue that by promoting Bitcoin we're all responsible for high fees by generating demand.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:45:51
That's very presumptuous. There's no current data that tells us the fee market wouldn't be viable at much higher block sizes.
And if we're just arguing the viability of the fee market against block size, a dynamic block size is easily superior since you will end up with more fees overall by including more txs.
I can understand the big blocks / hard to be a node argument---so I won't fight that.. but I think it would have been a lot smarter to have layer two tech further along in development before imposing a fee market. I think if things worked out like that, adoption wouldn't have halted and there would be more incentive and more capital to run a node.
So many people say onchain can't scale, so fine.. most reasonable people aren't suggesting scaling onchain forever. I'm constantly surprised why people think "kicking the can down the road" isn't (wasn't) a reasonable thing to do two years ago.

@_date: 2017-12-26 04:38:21
You can't "use a hard fork" if the miners aren't on it first. The miners running the backwards incompatible software is by definition what makes the fork "hard".
Let's say all the node operators switched to a new software that was incompatible but the miners didn't, they would see no blocks and only people making transactions on the previous software would get mined.
Segwit could have been done as a hard fork in the first place but it would have required the miners to agree to running it, so instead it was made as a softfork so that miners and other nodes / wallets could continue working while people upgrade.

I don't need to spin anything. You're a victim of the bullshit, loud BCH minority. This is *literally the exact same problem* that has happened for years, long before BCH ever existed, about the nonsense, FUD spewing small blockers. Loud, incessant trolls on both sides.
The **vast** majority of BCH supporters do not want it to be called, or confused with the Bitcoin you know an love. It's an annoying struggle we deal with *everyday*, within our own camp. 
Most BCH supporters just like the roadmap for bitcoin scaling and nothing more. There's nothing I can do personally to stop Ver from being a dick.. please.. I promise you.. there are totally legitimate, frustrated "big block" / BCH supporters who only want what's best for the crypto community.

Bitcoin is currently inflationary. It's the predictable inflation schedule that people like about Bitcoin. If another coin offers an inflation schedule that never ends, but is just as predictable as Bitcoin, then it provides a different value proposition, one that encourages more rotation in the economy.
Inflation by itself isn't a terrible thing, it's just impossible to predict or properly control with fiat.

What is all the fuss with the current state of mining centralization? I thought the only real advantage of having more than 50% hashing power is the possibility to double-spend and potentially blocking certain transactions. These two things alone aren't very attractive reasons to centralize considering either act would completely harm Bitcoin's reputation. This vs governments who gain far more control for their centralization efforts.

It's nothing like that at all with two pools, but let's imagine it's literally two people. It costs a lot of money to mine! Would you buy bitcoin from a miner that changed limit on coins?

Nothing prevents that case. At some point you have to realize that if everyone in the world except for you worked off of a chain that increased the number of coins, well.. that's bitcoin.

I think there's a space to fill in money technology that's more decentralized than governments and less decentralized than every individual being able to audit everything. 
So while I agree that PoS can be a very good solution for *a* crypto, it doesn't devalue a PoW crypto that still bring value, however more centralized than initially expected. At some point decentralizing things further has diminishing returns.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:11:19
No one knows exactly what is going to happen. Chances are that some miners will run it. For some time after the fork there will be two chains and one of the chains won't have enough hashing power to meet the difficulty target. Once that happens (which should be within a day at most) most miners will switch to the chain that's accumulated more difficulty, which could be legacy or 2x.

This would be a terribly sad state of affairs, if after several years of warning of the dangers of hard forking, one would occur  *now* because it seems worse not to.
Before segwit was a thing, basically everyone was on board with a blocksize "kick the can down the road" compromise, but the hard fork logistics were too complex / dangerous. That complexity remains today (for the most part).. so either it was never that complex to begin with or we're going headfirst into dangerous territory.

As a point of clarification, it didn't raise the blocksize  to handle *the* scaling issue. Issues around scaling still exist in both camps, BCH raised the blocksize to remedy the *current* issue of full blocks, rising transactions fees, longer confirm times. With headroom in the blocks again, research continues on the many paths to scaling including layer two solutions, which indeed are being developed on the BCH network as we speak.

I think you're misusing the word censor here. If you can't afford a hotdog, the hotdog salesperson isn't censoring you. In fact, if the hotdog salesperson knew you personally they might give you a discount. Miners are no different. They operate at maximum profit, but are still human at heart, and often sacrifice some profits for a wide variety of reasons from stupidity to charity to experimentation etc.
Its not a zero sum game.. there are many paths towards scaling, reducing fees and fostering true censorship resistance.

I feel like you're being needlessly defensive. If there were no issues, then there would be no reason to start development on Lightning. We knew full blocks were coming for years, and eventually once the blocks became full fees started rising just like everyone expected them to. 
It may have not been an issue for you, but it was for others so people started work on other solutions, XT, lightning, segwit, classic etc

I read this sub every day. I've been reading it every day for almost three years. I've seen trolls come and go, some of which were actually paid to come post on reddit. 
I've seen people dedicate every word, day in and day out, spewing anti-bitcoin BS for god knows what reason.
But one thing is absolute certain. There is no consensus amongst readers of this sub. There is no 'community' that makes up all of us. We are many, from all over, with lots of differing opinions. 
So when one dude, or two or three or ten, come in and say things that you don't agree with, even if they're blatantly wrong, whatever you're doing is the WORST way to handle it.
Conserve your energy, choose your words wisely, downvote with caution, and best of all, don't tell people they're subhuman excrement. Grow up.

This would be a contradiction in almost every other business imaginable. Sure some business can afford to rehire and retrain and entirely new staff but that's, at the very least, them dictating a brief and potentially costly hiccup.
In any case, it's inaccurate. When you buy a burger from McDonalds, *an* employee is basically your butler for 1 minute--but nobody says that, or calls them *your* employee. 
It's even less accurate than that since there's no McDonalds just a bunch of volunteers who are free to leave whenever they want. This is the furthest thing from an employee, making their power to dictate, at least for themselves, far greater.
I'm not trying to argue the benefits of any fork here, but I wish people, especially such vocal people, would be less disingenuous.

This remains to be seen. It's an easy thought experiment to imagine scenarios where the opposite is true.
Imagine the block size limit was set at 1kb. That's far easier to decentralize than 1mb, but now the tx per sec has dropped to insanely low levels. Lightning will still work on the 1kb blockchain, you just need to open and close channels less frequently.
Which is more secure, which one is paying a higher price? The 1mb chain or the 1kb chain?
Time will tell what is a good block size limit so that the system is decentralized enough to protect against corruption, but there's no reason to believe that 1mb is the magic number.

Some people will tell you one or the other, but the truth is that "originality" doesn't exist in the same way that when there's a fork in a road you have two roads that lead back to the original one.

It's a catch-22 though. People who can afford fees don't need p2p cash. The citizens of the world who need bitcoin the most can't afford the artificially inflated fees. 
It's just not that straightforward, and the most likely outcome is many cryptos working in tandem for various demographics.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:37:33


by what measuring stick? number of nodes? The extremely vast majority of people making transactions are using spv wallets. The cost of running an abc node today is cheaper than a core node since there are fewer transactions so if "the potential" to run a node means decentralization then Bitcoin is even less p2p.
Look I get it, you hate BCH and you're certain Lightning network will blow it out of existence. The problem with that thinking is that reasonable people will just take you as ignorant.
Quick though experiment:
BCH implements Lightning network and Bitcoin increases the block size limit. The devs hug it out and now only users are left wondering how to feel. Is it still worth it to take sides at the point?

a satoshi, a millionth of a bitcoin, is only the smallest unit now because there's no reason to divide further, or for that matter, even that far, nonetheless.

Yes you can buy them with cash. All you need to receive them is a bitcoin wallet address. If you have a smartphone you can download [this app]( which will generate an address for you with which you can receive and send coins. 
Alternatively if you don't have an internet connected phone you could create a wallet address at [blockchain.info]( print the QR code and just show that to the seller of coins.
Pretty much all you need is a wallet address, which is just a string of characters. It's pretty annoying to type it in by hand so a QR code is useful for the seller. There are many ways to generate addresses, just make sure no one has the private key for that address but you. 
Does that make sense?

The benefit of being affiliated to the network is that everyone within the network a coupon monthly of bitcoins spendable, the same amount for everyone, as the account grows, grows the amount of the coupon, the goal for a given term would be that the amount of the coupon would be enough to make millionaire world.
These members would be integrated into the community to make it more strong and grow, making everyone rich.

A 51% attack is a real concern, though not something to worry too much about because a) miners will likely gain more by NOT completely destroying trust in the network and b) this is long known problem and many mining pools have measures put in place to prevent this from happening.
As already mentioned, governments could make transacting with bitcoin illegal, though that would only effect users under a particular government, which is another reason why governments wouldn't want to do that and drive the business elsewhere.

You don't send bitcoins to e-mail addresses. You send them to bitcoin wallet addresses. Go make one right now at [blockchain.info]( If you have bitcoins somewhere and you want to sell them, you transfer them to the wallet address listed in your Mt Gox account.
If you want to buy bitcoins, first you must fund your Mt Gox account (presumably with USD) . There are several methods for this, I hear bitinstant is good. Once the funds are in Mt Gox, you can trade USD for bitcoins. Then you can send (withdraw) your bitcoins to the wallet address you made at blockchain.info .

Is now a good time to invest? I think so, because I believe in bitcoin and that it will rise over the next few years. Is now the best time? I have no idea. Nobody knows where it's really going.
I hear Coinbase is good but they run out coins a lot, it seems. Try bitfloor, bitinstant, i saw bitstamp the other day. localbitcoins is always a great way to go. i'm sure others can jump in, but even mt gox isn't that bad, they're just big so they have a lot of lag sometimes.

Accepting how? As a merchant? The benefit is that you may get customers who are only willing to pay for your service with litecoins. That and the exchange rates are different, so that could be beneficial or detrimental depending on how long you hold on to them, bitcoin included.
@_date: 2013-07-22 01:12:13
You can create a buy ad and set your own price. Remember that exchanges charge fees and it costs a little to make deposits/withdrawals, wires. With local people you can negotiate.
Edit: just checked the Bay Area localbitcoins.com ads.. prices don't seem too shabby to me. What exchange rate were you expecting to pay? Cheaper than Mt Gox?

I don't think that's true. I'm looking at recent blocks on blockchain and all I can see is 744 and 745, mined 20 seconds apart. But nothing else is even close to that.
It does look like a pretty big adjustment is on the way though.

No way! I haven't used Mt Gox before but I highly doubt you need to be verified to withdraw BTC. Only for large amounts of USD I believe.

It's a pretty expensive move to misplace trust in the network, but in the end it's not going to punch to big of a whole in the concept of cryptocurrencies. It wouldn't be long before something superior replaced bitcoin and was less likely to be attackable by this.

Mt Gox doesn't control bitcoin. When they're closed, people are free to exchange anywhere else.

Isn't that fundamentally what day-trading is though? Personally I think people could do something better for the world, but day traders don't intrinsically lower the demand for bitcoin, do they?

The scheduled adjustments are completely based on past performance. If blocks are mined too fast because of, say, asic's coming on the market. Then the difficulty goes up. If everybody suddenly stopped mining, the difficulty would go down. (Every 2016 blocks). This mechanism is used so that blocks continue to be mined every 10 minutes on average.

Don't sink your savings into bitcoins if you can't afford to lose it all. Next year they might be worth $1000, or maybe be $10. I'd definitely buy though, if you can.

I believe this is fairly short sighted. It's spiking around now, but as adoption rises and speculating becomes less profitable it will begin to stabilize.

I thought bitpay let's you keep your bitcoins if you wanted, in fact I'm under the impression that you can even decide what % of btc you want from sales. So volatility only makes as much difference to a merchant as he wants. 
If you decide to get paid USD then it doesn't matter what btc prices are. Only the customer is taking the risk.

Hmm that's a great question. One of the ideas I heard in this sub was a gaming platform that has bitcoin ante built in, per kill / tournament style or something.

If you want to buy things anonymously with btc you already can. That feature doesn't need to be 'added', so to speak. Increased security for people that don't care about anonymity won't take away that feature for those that do. 
Er.. to answer your question more directly, yes: there will be a road separating us, in the exact same way that if you wanted to buy drugs with fiat, you'd probably use cash.

You *can* send bitcoins from Mt Gox to buy things, but that's not what it's for and I don't know a single person who would recommend keeping your bitcoins there. 
Where you store your bitcoins comes down to security and preference. A wallet like the one on blockchain.info is much more secure than the one on Mt Gox, much faster, and provides lots of extra stuff too.
If you have a LOT of bitcoin and you just want to save it for later, look into 'cold storage' or 'offline wallets'. These options have the highest security from others but are more complicated and can lead to lost coins.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:51:20
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:08:56
You don't 'add funds' to bitcoin Qt. You can send bitcoins there, but you must already own them somewhere else, like on an exchange or in an online wallet like blockchain.info. If you don't already own bitcoins you can buy them on a bitcoin exchange like Mt Gox or CampBX ( there are many exchanges ).
You can also buy bitcoins directly from another person. But I wouldn't suggest this unless you already know the basics of bitcoin wallets well enough.

I think we should all remember that bitcoins were basically off the radar before this year. I don't think anyone expected it to take off so suddenly, and surely no one is expecting it to become the currency of the future, tomorrow. We're barely getting passed the wild west phase. Play at your own risk. 
The only thing makes fiat easy to spend for non-tech saavy people is massive institutions like interac and credit card companies that have all worked together to create infrastructure: point of sale machines.
Buying things online with bitcoin is super easy, it's just a matter of time before bitcoin credit cards and point of sale machines are more ubiquitous.

I might be reading all the wrong press, but I haven't heard anyone think there bitcoins are 1) of infinite supply 2) insured 3) only tradeable for other currency  5) all wallets are the same. Those are maybe the bottom 4 myths about bitcoin.
4) mining is an easy way to get rich:
well this isn't so much a myth as it is old news. and back when it was old news no one knew they were going to get rich.
6) satoshi pretty much is a mystery! That's not a myth. even if we can speculate some details there is no consensus about it.
8) computer processing power absolutely backs bitcoin! it would be a myth to say that it's only for minting new coins. this article says the value is determined by people's trust in the coin and the trust in the coin comes directly from computer processing ie transaction verification
9) if you lose your bitcoins, just because it makes other's bitcoins more valueable doesn't mean it's completely harmless to the system. the 'damage' done by lost bitcoins is a story yet to be told, not a complete myth.
