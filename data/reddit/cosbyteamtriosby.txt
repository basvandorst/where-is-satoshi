If they sell them, it's a loss.
If they hold them, it's a devaluation. 
Stop the bullshit.
Do you know how to tell when bitcoin has a good 3-5 years before the next 25% price rise? When people are spinning bullshit like this, and when the front page looks like it does.

That's exactly what I'm saying. The majority isn't going to buy into the idea that one mistake can leave them penniless with no recourse.  It makes the 10,000 general cash rule seem reasonable.
WHERE IS THE GOD DAMN INSURANCE FOR BITCOIN???? With a system like bitcoin, insurance can only be offered by a bank or vault. WAKE THE HELL UP EVERYONE!!!
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:28:29
You cannot have the key. I have to emphasize that point. Your bitcoins would be in their wallet. The second you transfer the coins out of their wallet, they are no longer insured.

I'm in Chennai right now; can confirm to the rest of America: India doesn't give a fuck. There are waaaaaay too many people here and waaaaay too much going on for bitcoin to ever be on the radar of law enforcement.
And as for trade in India; you just have to be here to get a clear picture that something like bitcoin cannot be regulated in India.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:24:00
You miss the point: OP is part of the crew bandying that one of the core benefits of bitcoin is, aside the risk of losing your entire stash due to having no insurance, that bitcoin is "cheaper" to transfer...
What these idiots don't consider is that, at the individual level, bitcoin's costs are astronomically higher than the fiat system due to risk of loss and theft. I'll pay the .5% extra for the time being.  Once my bitcoins can be properly insured, then I will laude how awesome it is for consumers.  For now, it's a fucking terror to own bitcoins
@_date: 2015-06-05 00:30:17


Insurance is the only way and insurance companies do not feel comfortable not having control of your keys; it would be too easy to defraud them.
 There is no way the protocol can be tweaked in order to spread the risk of an unforseen mishap happening at the individual level to the masses.
People want to literally hand off their property to someone they feel they can trust, whether that trust was built by force does not matter. The current system is trusted because there is nothing else comparable to it.  Bitcoin does the exact opposite of the current system and tells the user "you can only trust yourself".   It isn't possible for a protocol to be sentient enough to provide recourse for accidents or mishaps without it actually being sentient. 
People very much like to say "hold my money, because I know that if something happens to it, it isn't my fault and you will make me whole".
HOWEVER, if bitcoin eventually ends up decentralizing insurance, then mark that up as another miracle, because it's going to take an omniscient entity to pull it off

I didn't come off clear.
1. While I've been playing tourist (before coming here I tried to be reborn as a native Indian but the paperwork has been delayed), I've been taken aback by how many people have smartphones here.  From lowly workers, to people sitting in a road stop, head's are looking down into their screens. The 3g network from Chennai through Trichy was strong strong, even through stretches on nothingness. Their smartphones just need that "killer wallet".
2. All they need is the desire to use bitcoin, and that's it. It's a done deal.  Right now, bitcoin does not create a desire to use it simply because it provides no immediate benefit RIGHT NOW to these people. Give them bitcoin for rupees and great, now what? Where is the benefit for them? Where can they spend it? Is it increasing in value? Nowhere and no respectively.
3. Regulatory uncertainty isn't stopping adoption in India; the lack of education and immediate benefit is.

Gotcha. However, given the ease with which it easy to defraud an insurance company that insures bitcoin, you can assume that the premium is too high at the individual level.

with what machinery will the rest of the world be able to secure the new coin? the hypothetical mining companies will have benefited from economies of scale to the point where practically no one is mining at their homes. so when you join a different coin, as soon as it gets legs, they will take it over easily, since independent mining will need time to grow.

Help me understand: So they fork. Their fork contains my balances and keys.  Their fork has 100x the difficulty then the rebelious, non-inflated fork because they have 100x the hardware.  
How is the non-inflated, people's fork protected from their misdeeds? What crucial element am I missing?  Because I fail to see how the preferred global blockchain will be the one that is, even for a week or two, 100x smaller than the now inflated blockchain.  Remember, they can attack your non-compliant fork easily until they bully everyone into complying.

If enough people like you pledge enough coin and outbid the shopping mall magnate, you win.  Otherwise he wins fair and square and you just dont shop at that mall or you skip town.
It's an oversimplification, I know, but there are other forms of government that can be implemented.  It wont be within the next 50 years probably, but we have to start somewhere.

After browsing coinmap.org for a combined several hours, it's good to see BTC merchant acceptance springing up in the niche/specialized trades at a much higher adoption rate than the more standardized and widespread businesses. 
I don't believe BTC price appreciation is tied to merchant acceptance as it is tied to simple public understanding of the impact of a free currency. Therefore, popular merchants not taking the risk of implementing bitcoin payment processing does not bother me. Ultimately, if BTC takes off, those niche/local businesses are already positioned to serve the growing btc crowd.
Whether they succeed in the long run ultimately depends on having a good product or service.  But the potential of innovative/creative entrepreneurs having a shot at the big time (through the adoption of a forward thinking payment processing system) can introduce a drastically different economy.

If bitcoin becomes huge in other places in the world, they wont be able to keep such a valuable asset out of their borders, and bitcoin will eventually slip through. All they've done by banning is it put themselves at the end of the adoption list, but not out of it.

Still holds true.  What China is saying is: "You thought you owned the money we print, but you've actually only borrowed it from us. We forbid you to give our property over to someone else in exchange for a super long password that exists on other people's computer".
So yeah, bitcoin is a success in that way and regardless of how little renminbi you can get for a bitcoin, bitcoin still makes a mockery out of central banking.  Think nice and hard at what they're actually banning when they prohibit bitcoin to fiat trade.
I thought BTC had no "intrinsic value".  Why then are they threatened? Governments fighting Bitcoin and we act like we're surprised?  I guess the libertarian side is winning the bitcoin arguments they've always made. Bitcoin will destroy governments and China is the first one to move against it.

the detailed list of how a budget will be spent is a collection of the feedback of lower managers. so a marketing manager without batting an eye will sign off on $50,000 for social media strategies; "evangelism" is the buzzword here. 
this isnt consipiracy lunacy. companies and other agencies are allocating larger ratios of their marketing budget on direct interactions with stakeholders and customers; social media being one of the must haves.  Big organizations are no longer relying on college interns to handle their twitter pages and calling it good - there is real effort behind tageting specific groups with messages that align with their overall strategy.
the incentive is clear: a well rounded social media strategy will net you more share of mind per dollar, and that's what its all about today. no longer is it about yelling at people to buy your product and calling it a day; you have to make people believe in the same ideas that the corporation believes. but you have to be covert or viral, otherwise it's ineffective

They admit it cost them $19 to build; selling it a pharmaceutical margins without any real protection is asking to get fucked.  If it cost $19 to make and they didn't sell it for $50 or less, that's on them.  Bad business decision on their part, especially since there was a lot of vocalization from people thinking the price was absurd. Arrogance.
If Trezor were priced at $50, while BWallet enters at $30, don't you think an authentic Trezor would've had a better chance to survive, given that SatoshiLabs has intellectual cred over BWallet? I think so.
SatoshiLabs needs to swallow their pride and sell these things at 200% markup or less; they will sell marginally more volume and beat back the wave of competitors headed their way (who, oh by the way, will hire devs to support upgrades).

nation states existed before centralized banking because they much more readily resorted to violence to tax producers and laborers.  They would also accept a percentage of goods produced as taxes. 
As economies became more complex in their mix of goods, services and technologies, nation states had to absolutely resort to taxing in currency mostly, and central banking provided a robust, reliable system for this to unfold.
Taxing our labor outside of the banking system is going to be very difficult for a nation state; it was not difficult to tax an agrarian society in medieval times.  If the govt cannot trace our incomes, they cannot tax it.  The "nation states existed before banking" argument is only valid if you compare our economy to economies of the distant past.
Stop dismissing what is staring you right in the face. It's a sign of fear and closed-mindedness.  Where did you think the whole idea of "globalization" was headed?  Bitcoin is a natural evolution in that direction.

Will there be a human inputting asset values into this application?  If not, a decentralized, universal, highly-divisible, widespread, limited supply currency is all you need to achieve this. (e.g. bitcoins).  
The concept is that there can only be one supremely dominating currency, with all other currencies serving as a back up or speculative tool.  None of this "How much is one btc worth in $?" business; once that question becomes irrelevant, you have your solution.
No central bank currency can do this if the name of the game is artificial manipulation against 100s of other banks.

Very nice, thank you for this analysis. 
One final multiplication I'd like to add to your result is, how much of world trade is transacted in BTC? I know it's probably infinitesimally small, but a rough estimate serves me good.
Here's my hypothetical scenario, given your roughly 1 square acre result:
Currently, bitcoin processes $10,000,000 (I have no idea if this is true)  in economic transactions a day requiring 1 square acre of mining land.
The entire globe makes currency trades in the amount of $10,000,000,000,000 per day (no idea if it's true but think of consumer purchases, businesses purchases, currency transfers, remittances, etc.).  This figure is possibly too low, but we'll go with it.
That means that bitcoin would have to grow 1,000,000 X, requiring 1,000,000 time the acreage to process these transactions.
1million acres is roughly 40 square miles of mining farms in today's technology, if difficulty moves linearly with transaction volume...
What do you think about the future landscape of mining farms in a bitcoin-dominated global economy, assuming today's technology?

I think we're looking at two different time horizons.  I see the consolidation of nation states happening no sooner than 50 years from now. At that point, if bitcoin becomes the central global currency, then the business landscape would've changed drastically.
Remember, the US may have certain tax traditions and processes that'll take time to change, but developing countries bypassing central banking and effective governments will not report taxes in the way we in the US do.  If there is a loss of competitive advantage due to tax reporting compliance, tax reporting will go away in the long run.

yep.  Imagine a bitcoin pitchman in front of a VC/Bank/govt panel etc, and being asked "How many transactions can the network handle?".   The VC/bank needn't wrap their heads around the entire bitcoin concept before doling out this question; they can take his word for it that the network is secure and that supply is fixed.  They want to know network capacity right away, before getting into the social/political implications of a one-world currency.

Some noteworthy institutions have decided to risk capital into bitcoin recently, but it's pocket-change.  They probably invest 10x more in shittier ideas and ventures.  
What's holding bitcoin back from blowing up is that a 7-tps bitcoin is worth no more than $250, and possibly a whole lot less if 7 tps becomes the ultimate limit. Speculation can only eventually move the price to close to its utility value, and at 7 tps, $250 is way too expensive.
As a person who has placed hard cash and done his part to prop up the price to the benefit of myself and all others:  TIME FOR AN UPGRADE, MOTHERFUCKERS. GET TO WORK.

if bitcoin will be what we think, the price will continue growing for decades.  As long as bitcoin is highly irregular in its distribution, you will continue seeing this mania.  but this is unsurprising when you can buy such a large piece of the pie for relatively so little. people who deal in securities have known this for centuries.

I knew it. I knew it, knew it, knew it. This sub lacks sense.
I need insurance as a hedge, a diversification. I may want to hold some portion of my wealth, but not all. I may want another trusted entity to back me up in case of a massive failure. Let me determine the risk. 
You're operating under the premise that the US financial system will fail (to be honest, bitcoin is the biggest threat, but otherwise it could last well beyond my lifetime).  For every Cyprus or Greece you cite, there's a London or New York.
I need insurance and not just me, buddy. We need it like we need fucking air. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?  If bitcoin does not develop a healthy insurance market, it'll be just a couple of fucking jokers trading online tokens for gift cards.
Insurance isn't some fiat phenomena; it is essential to trade and essential to even a primitive financial market. It comes in all forms and its purpose is to reduce risk, not increase it.
Holding on to all your bitcoins is no different than storing dollars under a mattress. IT IS FUCKING STUPID.

So let's get this straight:

Sorry brother, but you're going to have to put this point up against the risk of losing your bitcoins to carelessness, fraud, or theft.
Ask the question: 
What is more likely today: me losing my bitcoin to carelessness or thievery, or me losing dollars through govt confiscation?  The former is almost always more likely and still is even for Greece.  The Greek govt will most likely not take 100% of Greek deposits, whereas you can easily lose 100% of your bitcoins (unless you bury 10 different wallets in 10 different locations. Yay.)
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:32:04
It's not about your ability to nimbly use bitcoin; what good is a global financial system that only 1% of the people can use efficiently? I'm not implying that it won't be a better landscape in the future, but RIGHT NOW the entire bitcoin ecosystem, given all variables (block size, smartphone adoption, user comprehension, etc.) is just not there.
I am ecstatic that you can use bitcoin. You get my highest praise for being the genius you are. But it doesn't mean much if virtually no one else is participating.

Still too hard to understand. The average American needs an app that knows how much bitcoin he/she needs by measuring their blood sugar levels. The app would automatically deposit two cheeseburgers worth of bitcoin when they hit a certain threshold. The app would then automatically order the burgers and transfer the coins over to their favorite slophouse.
The app would do the same for mobility scooter battery and oil changes.

In the US, buying bitcoin is extremely easy.  You open a coinbase account with no more steps than it takes to open a venmo or paypal account.  It's impossible for it to be any easier unless you exchange cash for some.
I mean, HOW CAN IT BE REDUCED TO FEWER STEPS? I don't see us being able to beam bitcoins into anyone's brain any time soon. 
It's not the difficulty in acquiring bitcoin that is slowing mass-adoption; it's a general lack of interest and practicality that is the cause.
