It's a UK company, but their bank account is in Slovenia. I don't think their bank account being in Slovenia means much from a UK regulatory perspective - but I guess they just haven't been able to obtain a relationship with any UK banks. Intersango (another uk exchange) still operates (although doesn't accept any new accounts at the moment and does very little volume) and uses a Polish bank. bitcoin-24 - when it operated was also a UK company, but banked in Poland and Germany. 
IBWT doesn't actually have a real 'bank account' - they have a cashplus business account.. cashplus is a prepaid debit card provider that provides debit card accounts with an attached UK sortcode/account number (so much like a bank account - can receive local bank transfers). 
Perhaps cashplus will turn out to be a viable option for bitcoin exchanges, I'm not really sure.. It seems like btc-e also uses some vaguely similar arrangement with a debit card provider for their 'bank account' so perhaps this kind of scheme is viable.. I kindof half expect it to be shut down as soon as someone notices though.

I think perhaps they take the stance that it's not them that you're trading with, but the other exchange member that's selling - so it would theoretically be up to them to include VAT in their price and pay it out to HMRC. Either that or maybe HMRC will decide that actually bitcoins are 0% rated for VAT like foreign currencies (but they haven't said that officially yet).
