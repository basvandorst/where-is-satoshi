If we're going to go way into the weeds on semantic bullshit, the proof of work of any particular coin has an inherent floor value pegged at the cost of electricity that went into generating it.
But my facetious asshattery aside, I agree entirely. A currency that can't be redeemed is useless and valueless.

It's a currency. It can stabilize at *any* price and make it. It's instability that kills a currency's viability.
It doesn't have to be economically viable to crunch new coins. In fact, prices will always be volatile for as long as that remains true, since people will be introducing instability in the form of unscheduled green circulation.

Just in time to crush FOMO dreams for a second Christmas in a row!
I've got a strong feeling that we're going to see another speculative spike and crash when BTC cracks 16k again. Crypto is (seen as) a lot easier to get into than traditional stocks, which seems to make it more prone to FOMO-amplified speculation when things start coming up bull.

And if you're in the middle of an economic crisis, $5 fees and half-day confirmation times aren't going to help.

Sort of like the service Western Union provides?  Or traditional banks provide?
There's a terrible irony in how Coinbase was marketed between it's early days and now.
