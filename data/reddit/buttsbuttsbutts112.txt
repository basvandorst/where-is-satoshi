This plan is working out really well for Roger Ver, maybe you could ask him for some advice.
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:35:17


No it isn't.

Smart people generally do not gamble.

This is huge!

hmm, perhaps there is something to be learnt here

Wow, that IBM 1401 seems to violate the first law of thermodynamics. Will the wonders of blockchain technology never cease?

Right, one of the most influential and well-known economists in the world is completely irrelevant. Yes. Makes sense.

Great idea, a new wiki is exactly what we need!

That's right, the reward is for producing a valid block. Including any transactions is strictly optional.
