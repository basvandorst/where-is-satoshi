That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $1000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on. 
This is the best Bitcoin investment advice:
[Dollar cost average]( by buying what you can afford to lose every week.
It is always a good time to buy bitcoin if you are holding long term and not just for day trading. Don't wait for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

@_date: 2017-05-27 16:33:28
No, Bitcoin's price bottom becomes more solid and elevated with time, as more hodlers not just don't sell during the "crashes" but buy more during those dips, just look at any historic graphic. And bitcoin has not even started its exponential growth, but we are getting close to that 'S' curve and many countries are legitimizing Bitcoin and tens of thousands of new players enter the game every single week.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:12:53
Those don't matter since they are pre-mined centralized infinite supply pump-and-dump alt-coins. Once those bubbles pop, most of that money will go back to Bitcoin (which it was used to buy them in the first place) and also they are attracting masses to the area and they will en up also jumping in as bitcoin Hoddlers. So the general picture looks even better now for bitcoin than ever before.

Please stop bashing a good company. What you don't get is that for regular people it is much easier to lose their coins if they store them themselves. Unfortunately, there is a use for fully regulated and licenced US exchanges in order for Bitcoin to become mainstream. Also, please stop calling "paid shills" people who like their services.

More confident here. It proves wrong the scores of trolls that were spreading FUD predicting ridiculously low prices. Everybody panic selling their coins will regret it, we have literally tens of thousands of new players entering the game every week in an ever-increasing number of countries.

Only new and weak hands get shaken out of their coins. Bitcoin will be OK no matter what. For the long term, we know the forecast is MOON. For the short term these are the two options:
1) Bitcoin development/price growth stalls or slows down if there is no agreement and Jihan/Roger have their way (price continue to rise but at a slow pace).
2) There is a scaling agreement, SegWit+LN activate and the price flies past $10,000 before the end of the year.

The point is that the tendency you refer to is decreasing as Bitcoin and its users mature, we are not implying that we won't have any more fear-based dips/corrections. It's all about cycles, but not all cycles are the same, it's more like an ascendant spiral: the next cycle looks similar, but it's in a different position after the learning/experience from the previous cycle.

The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent.
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

Reminder for the new users: there was no good real reason to sell last times and there is no real reason to sell now based on the incoming split/fork FUD. Only new and weak hands get shaken out of their coins. Bitcoin will be OK no matter what. For the long term, we know the forecast is MOON. For the short term these are the two options:
1) Bitcoin development/price growth stalls or slows down if there is no agreement and Jihan/Roger have their way (price continue to rise but at a slow pace).
2) There is a scaling agreement, SegWit+LN activate and the price flies past $10,000 before the end of the year.
So, no matter what, HODL. If there is a deep, buy more.

The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) **backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined.** There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
 
 
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
 
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent.
 
 
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
 
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
 
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
 
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
 
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

Ignore the typical FUD here against everything exchange related. Coinbase is a fully licenced and legit US exchange (as it is Gemini). The Vault is very safe, it can't get hacked or stolen, the coins are offline in cold storage and there is a delay to withdraw as well as several other security measures (like a series of email confirmations trough the waiting period). Is much more likely and probable to lose your coins if you store them yourself, even if you are tech savvy, there are thousands of things that can go wrong at this early stages of Bitcoin.

Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system.
Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys.
