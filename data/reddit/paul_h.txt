The terms of use at the time would guide whether that was "shenanigans" or not. If there were, you could claim it was "destruction of evidence" if a court case were filed at the time or imminent. It is ten years on from the postings and six years on from you noticing the deletions -  if there is no court case then the shenanigans is just in the realm of mischief and **can't be called destruction of evidence**. I think all you're fighting here for is a recognition os "inventor" with compensation that jury might award for that alone, that's tempered by the fact that you yourself did not code or launch a cryptocurrency back then. The other side, if in the super millionaire territory would crush you in court, and your own lawyers would only be on board for a decent percentage of the compensation.
Excuse the attempt t humor here - you should have posting your writings in a system that was decentralized and tamper proof :)

Did you delete (and all postings/comments made by that account) and soon after create ?

Gambling being a state by state thing, and zoned too, yours right. One use of blockchain was for flight insurance (that was gambling if you delvedcibto it). Here’s an insurance industry 101 riddle: “Q: what’s the difference between gambling and (general) insurance? A: in insurance you have to have a loss before you have a ‘win’”
Were you into all the mathematics stuff of Merkle trees before your initial discussions on godlike productions?

I'm unconcerned as to whether Craig is Satoshi or not. 
I'm interested in what is the legal basis for you taking one or more people to court. Specifically whether it is patent law, trademark law, copyright law, or trade secrets (per a contract or NDA) that is the basis for the **civil** suit.
Secondly I'm interested in the **criminal** basis for a law enforcement to pursue in a court case against Craig or others. What act of violence, threat, or theft of property (not covered by copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret as law enforcement leaves those for you to pursue in cases like this).
"Public Domain" in various guises is what I'm pondering here. If you talked in a supermarket about CryptoCurrencies and some mom with toddlers heard you then patented it, you're shit of luck as patent is "first to patent" not the actual inventor. You didn't get that mom to sign an NDA before speaking loudly about.
If you're getting death threats, then law enforcement would prosecute the offenders for you, sure.

That archive is from 2013. There's nothing older. Only SourceForge insiders could verify the date in 2009 when that item was allegedly uploaded.

Sounds like you have the summary needed to engage lawyers then.

OK, so from your other comments:


So you have a patent, that exchange owners should have licensed? I'm looking but can't find it -  
Of course, inventors can only prevent others from profiting from inventions if they patent the invention. There's a short period of secrecy after the patent filing, but then after the approval of the patent is available for all to read. You can be the inventor of something without patenting it, but you extract license fees from others from utilization of the invention.

OK so the reason for backdating coins was to simply be able to say that they (Satoshi/Craig/others) "invented" cryptocurrencies, and you David Leakey did not. This claim that they make is only for a place in the history books. As you didn't patent it then, and cannot now (the idea is in the public domain), you can't profit from it based on the "invention". Thus it is difficult to see how this is fraudulent. If it is not fraudulent you can't legally pursue them for monetary losses. You could perhaps for slander/libel but that's a different thing. The jurors would want to see when you discovered the Satoshi paper and when you first attempted to set the record straight.

So you’re taking a programmer to court for breaching an NDA or employment/work for hire contract and going ahead without you, right?  How much are you going to ask for in compensation in this civil case?

You can't apply for a patent for something that's a) either been patented already, or b) is in the public domain.
Why would judge and jury (forgive me for going lower case there) be interested in Craig's documented manipulation of blog posts? What would they be adjudicating in terms of a civil or criminal case? Lying to a police/peace officer - sure that can get you in front of a judge. Lying 'online' to readers of blog entries cannot **unless** the price of a security or currency was being manipulated, but that may well have to be on an exchange regulated by the SEC in order for offenders to be arrested for insider trading. Indeed, insider trading prosecutions need not relate to **public statements** of those being prosecuted, only trades based on inside **knowledge** is needed.

Was the taking of the CryptoCurrency idea from you (as you say) on the Godlike Productions forum (?), subject to a commercial contract (or NDA) with the person that took the idea and commercialized it? You might have a case there for a civil case against that person.  
Was it actual code?  You might have a civil case (possibly criminal later) against the thief of that code, regardless of whether they were in subject to a contract with you.
Was it just talk in a forum, with no contract or NDA in place with the other forum members?  Most likely there's no theft because of that, and therefore no civil or criminal case against the person who was merely faster commercializing it than you.
Other forms of IP law that don't apply here: patent (by the inventor or first patentee), trademark (have to be applied for), trade secrets (needs to depend on contracts and perhaps some form of employer/employee relationship).

OK, so underlying Bitcoin is (and was then) a Merkle tree that shows the order of additions to the tree. Stand back quite a lot and it looks linear rather than tree-like.  For coins to be back-dated and inserted into the chain, the merkle tree would need to be trashed and re-issued afresh, culminating it entirely different hashes even if the legitimate coins were replaced again in the chain.  They could only get away with that if **nobody** were subscribing to the chain updates.
Why would they need to back-insert coins in history, rather than just mine them and add them at the end like everyone else?
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:25:49
So Satoshi would have brought a bunch of coins into the initial seeding of Bitcoin an somehow made them without the expended CPU effort conventionally needed. That he said they were conventionally mined is the fraud. Or perhaps his holding as far bigger at the start that he confessed.  Was there an ICO at the start, or did bitcoins float up from $0 naturally?

Is is slander you're going to pursue in a civil case?  To Craig based on his claim that he invented CryptoCurrencies?  That notwithstanding that "invent" is a widely over used term in culture generally.

Well I used to live in Dallas (2014) and it was fairly nice. Many signs too that Texas was broadening in terms of culture. If you’re a software professional, you don’t have to stay in a cartel infested area - the world is your oyster.

So hey, why did you delete your SourceForge account ?
