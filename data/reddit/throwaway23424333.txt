its actually you who talks about miners.
my post was only talking about bitnodes.21.co, instead of showing false data, they shouldn't show any data at all.
i think you're right that miner centralization is as important, i wasn't trying to say node&gt;miner.

lets say there are 1000 nodes and i create 100.000 nodes with this setup, the miner-blocks will have a harder(=longer) time to "propagate over the network". if i decide to not let them pass. especially longer for spv wallets.
just saying an attack starting up a few 100.000 nodes would be zero problem.
to all the politics in your post:
"PPS: throwaway because ppl in here are scary"

1. "demanding" is a bit strong, i would say advising
2. geolocation yes, but lots of people have servers at ovh or hetzner
3. i am just saying the number "5580 nodes" is of no real information
4. the problem is, that lots of people just look at that number, and look at the clients and say x number of y clients etc. to me it seems a bit random :)
5. bitnodes has no warning "numbers mean nothing, just looks good"
6. i literally can spin up 1000s of ips with a script in 1s, if i have a bit of money, even with different geo location. so "sockpuppet" is a bit of an understatement.
edit: ip geolocation is actually a bit overvalued imho
