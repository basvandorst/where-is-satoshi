If a person is going to spend bitcoin to buy something and then replace their spent bitcoin by purchasing it with fiat, why wouldn't they just buy the thing with fiat in the first place?
Everyone I know who has bitcoin isn't spending them.  If they have spent them, it's more as a novelty to try out, not as a way of doing business.

You may be taking future supply into account, but is the market working against existing supply or total future supply?  If I want a bitcoin now, don't I have to buy it from the existing supply, and won't it cost me more than it would if the total supply were already mined, claimed, and up for sale?  If I'm only willing to pay what I think a bitcoin is worth based on percent of total supply, market prices (which are based on existing supply) would seem too high, wouldn't they?

But that doesn't mean it's not inflating. Inflation means current supply is less than future supply. Why would you pay 2015 dollars for 2025 bitcoin?

Yes, it's their money and they can do what they want with it. But I think monetary policy shouldn't reward hoarding, it should reward money flowing to where it's needed to grow the economy. If I'm choosing an economy to participate in, I'm going to choose the one that's producing economic growth, not one where the holders of currency refuse to spend or invest for fear that they're losing even greater future purchasing power by giving up their precious coins. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:03:15
Why? because there is more supply? If more circulating supply lowers the price, how is the uncirculating future supply priced in now?
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:28:12
How are you locking in 2015 prices? With more coin in circulation in 2025, your purchasing power would most certainly shrink all else being equal.

I won't have any bitcoin to sell you because I won't own any bitcoin. I keep my wealth in equities, real estate, and some cash for transactional purposes.

But that still doesn't explain why 0% inflation is ideal. Yes too much incentive to spend, lend, or invest can cause malinvestment just like too much disincentive to spend, loan, or invest causes good projects to go unfunded. What is so special about 0% that it's somehow the sweet spot and 2% isn't? 
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:51:20
Then using an inflating currency should help them, not hurt them. Inflation hurts savers and helps debtors.

Impossible. If there is $4 trillion chasing X bitcoin today and that same $4 trillion will chase X+Y coins at some future date each coin will be worth less $ at that future date. Future supply can't be priced in because those coins aren't available for purchase so they're artificially scarce. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:31:48




But in the bitcoin economy people don't keep their money in banks, they keep their money in digital wallets where it won't be lent out so saving bitcoin doesn't help the economy with liquidity for growth. 
































How can you be sure where the sweet spot is between encouraging malinvestment and discouraging investments that are good for growing the economy?
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:41:16
The problem is there aren't 21M coins available for purchase, so the coins aren't priced as if there are 21M in existence. Anyone who bases their models off of a theoretical 21M coin supply would not buy coins at prices inflated by a much more limited actual supply of coins for purchase. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:37:26


But you yourself said the price would be lower if all coins were currently circulating. So which is it? Should the price move lower as the currency inflates or should it move higher? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:40:55
I'm quite familiar with the invisible hand. There's no reason the invisible hand can't work properly with 2% inflation. You're trying to change the subject because you know you don't have a good answer to the question. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:04:26
Fair enough, but if future supply is priced in, how much are you personally discounting in order to price that future supply in? How much more would you pay for a bitcoin if all 21M were already circulating?
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:35:35
Why is that stupid? I'd much rather people borrow money to buy a house or start a business or whatever than for everyone to hoard their money, removing liquidity from the economy. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:52:50


Exactly. Inflation is eroding your purchasing power. Just because you're expecting it to happen doesn't mean it isn't going to happen. If my time horizon for owning fiat is 10 years, I could probably estimate inflation over that time, but I still lose purchasing power even though the amount I'm expecting the currency to inflate is known. To say bitcoin isn't inflationary over the next few years is just plain wrong. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:42:47


But if the people who need those resources don't have the capital to buy them, it doesn't matter if they're cheaper. The point of discouraging hoarding is to allocate the capital to where it's needed for growth. Even if hoarding brought down prices for resources, it would be offset by the difficulty in acquiring enough currency to buy those resources in an economy where no one is lending, investing or spending.

Indeed. Good luck with your investments. I'm looking forward to checking back in on this community in a few years. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:13:28
That doesn't answer my question at all. How do you know that zero inflation is not an over correction that will prevent a lot of good economic development rather than only preventing malinvestment? how do you know that 2% inflation isn't better in terms of producing a better ratio of good investment to malinvestment?
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:44:46


Yes and no.  As more people decide to take that risk, the price goes up and people have to put even more money at stake to get involved.  So the decreased risk that it could go to zero is cancelled out by the increased risk of having to put even more money at stake to buy in.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:16:31
What is the difference between saving and hoarding? 
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:14:06


I would think that being backed by gold would make a currency stronger rather than weaker.  If I'm holding fiat that isn't backed by gold, buying gold would be a good way to hedge against the government inflating the currency.  If I'm holding currency that's backed by gold, I don't need to hedge because the currency itself should be as good as the gold that backs its value up.  So I should be *less* likely to choose gold over a gold backed currency than I would be to choose gold over fiat that isn't backed by gold.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:48:02


That's not saving, that's investing/lending. 


Why is that important. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:10:35
Ah, I understand. You subscribe to libertarian dogma in which it matters not how good a policy is in practice so long as it's anti government in theory. You're not someone who understands economics, which is why you haven't been able to comment on economics.

If the price per bitcoin is higher, I have to spend more to get a single coin.  Sure, I could buy fewer coins than I would have bought at the lower price, but that doesn't mean it's not a worse deal for me to pay more money for a smaller share of the total bitcoin supply.
So yes, the downside risk of going to zero is lower, but the upside benefit is also lower because I'm able to purchase fewer coins for the same amount of USD.  I think these factors would cancel each other out.

Being forced to get insurance is less like being forced to gamble and more like being forced to hedge.  An argument could be made that going without insurance is the bigger gamble, especially if you can't cover the consequences of a catastrophic situation without insurance.

I think having money at stake does more than just delay adoption.  Email costs nothing.  You can register a ton of email addresses and send off a ton of emails so easily.
With bitcoin, you have to put your money at stake to buy some bitcoin.  You can only buy as many as you can afford, and once you own them, you can't just spend them willy nilly or you'll have to go buy more.  I don't need a compelling case at all to use email because it costs literally nothing as long as I've got an internet connection.  I need a compelling reason to part with my dollars for bitcoin, and I'm not sure that a compelling enough argument exists for most people to want to make the switch.

But we're not talking about a situation where someone is trying to buy something from a seller that only accepts bitcoin, so they need a proxy for their USD.  We're talking about someone who has the option to keep their currency in USD or instead take a risk and buy some bitcoin.  If they're planning on holding the bitcoin for a while, the more they have to pay for their bitcoin, the more risk they're taking on that they'll lose purchasing power if there's a correction, and the less upside benefit they get if bitcoin goes up in value.


This is a good analogy.  TSLA at $22 had a greater risk of going to zero, but a lot more upside potential.  TSLA at $260 is less likely to go to zero, but you might still lose money if it's overvalued.  When you're deciding whether to buy TSLA, you don't disregard the price based on the logic that "the rate is what the rate is".  You look at the risk/reward potential and figure out whether it's overvalued or undervalued.

Possibly, although the capital controls in the eurozone are really more about the banks than the currency.  If Greeks could get their Euro out of the banks, I don't think they'd be rushing to buy bitcoin.  They'd probably be rushing to buy whatever they need to set themselves up somewhere other than Greece, which means having a currency that most people will accept as payment.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:00:45




I'm not really following the logic here.  The problem in Greece isn't their currency, it's their debt.  If they had enough gold in reserve to keep their economy running, they wouldn't be in crisis no matter what currency they used.

Some small amounts of cash might get hoarded, but for the most part the cash is always circulating.  I get some money from my employer, I give it to the bank to pay my mortgage, the bank lends it to someone who wants to start a business, and that business uses the money to pay employees, etc.  The cash is always somewhere at a given snapshot of time, but it's not meant to stay there, it's meant to flow, providing liquidity for economic activity.
