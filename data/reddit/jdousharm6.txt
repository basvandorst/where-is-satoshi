Correct me if I'm wrong or assuming this stat, but:
Don't the far majority of people who have invested in Bitcoin have little in-depth knowledge about how everything works and knowledge of the benefits behind alt-coins?
So doesn't that mean Bitcoin Cash is banking on the fact that the far majority is going to understand the complexity behind the currency and shift their dollars that they have invested into this mainstream Bitcoin into this alt-coin Bitcoin Cash?

By pairing your wallet just like you would you debit/credit card.
Not sure how the amount of money being processed has anything to do with practicality.

I agree with you there.
I guess the point I'm trying to make is that BTC creates it's own foundational "backing" when it's worth extremely large amounts like $100K for 1 BTC. Assuming global adoption is falling piece by piece, the world economy wouldn't allow BTC crash at an extremely high price.

Is it best to use keep your wallet on a USB due to things of this nature? I'm starting to feel that the only person you can trust with your BTC is yourself

Did you have BTC on your account?
