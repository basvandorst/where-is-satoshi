Trust less transfer of value over any distance that lacks a central fail point. Ex. Has bitcoin ever been compromised vs central systems.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:49:26
You don’t have to use bnb on Binance for fees. Also the fees you are talking about are merchant side for the most part and you are naive if you think they don’t charge you for it. 
You also neglected to respond to the rest of my point about the comparisons you are making.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:54:57
Yes it is? The government that the bank resides with has power over all the things you just stated. For the average person no, but the same can then be said for btc.
Diffrence being you can batch bitcoin transactions but not so much with credit and debit purchases.
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:48:13
You seem confused. Digital coins act as a store of value thus can be exchanged already no problem.
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:32:01
That is not a question homie.
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:00:18
binance, kucoin 2 major ones. foreign exchanges as well.
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:44:24
It would work your cpu for no effect mineing bitcoin. ASICS have made the network so difficult it’s pointless to mine with anything but a asic. You get into the same probability if you tried solo mineing with a asic to solve a block solo. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:02:02
once again how is your name or anything about you tied to the bitcoin address itself?
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:13:09
Are you mad?
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:43:10
Its not a conspiracy its the job of the irs to monitor banks. Who do you think prints USD? central us banks. Once again you cant see the balance of who you exchange with just the address you made the transaction with. I don't think you quite understand what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:46:17
is cash usable online (craigslist is not online since you are still meeting in person. I.E can you send it world wide?) . Idk why you are comparing it to bitcoin. Banks have your name and address tied to them making them less private them bitcoin. wallet != i.d.
Also you misquoted me. I meant the government ran nodes you talked about in your previous comment. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:07:38
Binance, kucoin both trade btc for very little to no fees.  secondly when do you use cash online. i don't mean in the form of a credit card or debit card but how often for can you do a money order for a purchase online. Never is the answer. You keep making arguments that don't make sense because the comparisons you are making are off base completely.
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:04:12
What if the wallet changes a few thousand times because lightning network enables it? You are right they could theoretically track where all of it goes but once again have no idea who owns it. Now its also in thousands of wallets that can be batched together without issue with small coding experience. Before you say not everyone has coding experience that is once again not what our original argument is about. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:03:10
why not? did not know i tied my id to my wallet. They can trace where it goes because bitcoin is a public ledger but not who specifically owns each address, which we can have as many as we want of.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:31:47
I think you are confused about difficulty of controlling multiple addresses. secondly you can also batch transactions to the point i could send 1$ 30 different times from different seeds instantly. Scripts make your above point mute. also to answer the fiat to crypto. The original point was that bitcoin &lt; privacy coins because privacy coins supposedly are completely safe. If you are trying to go back to fiat i no longer think your use case is the same. You are not using it as a currency but a store of value which is not the point we are arguing about. To use as a currency it is different then a store of value. To make a counterpoint anyway would be local bitcoin. Nsa cant demand info that a retailer doesn't have. "Give us all your address used; sure any of them still in use though? Did you magically get the seed from a public address?" I am not arguing against bitcoin being public, simply that bitcoin address =/ STATE ID/ NAME / PHYSICAL ADDRESS. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:00:41
no one said bitcoin was anonymous, but you are also saying that bitcoin addresses = STATE ID, which is not the case. You even say debit and credit purchases are protected. This confuses me since banks have more info on you then what a wallet will ever have. The point that we are making is that it is close to cash because the only thing actually tied to every transaction is a public address not your seed address, not your name, not anything about you other then some 1s and 0s which in no way represent anything about you only a place to receive or send money. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:14:27
once again not true. How do you know the new wallets owners?
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:37:38
since when do you have to use a exchange to use btc. secondly there are plenty of exchanges that do not require id. either you have to use fiat or crypto is irrelevant to the overall point that was made in the original comment.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:36:55
now just insults i see. Glad we could work this out. If you have any more questions feel free to ask.
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:31:24
They could easily move the funds and no one would know where if they keep splitting address. Address does not = seed. Idk how many times i have to tell you this. People could know its moved but thats not very helpful if you have no idea what for or who controls the new wallet. It can be indexed all you want but that does not give you extra info on the user. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:15:46
they still report how much goes in and out to the irs. and explain your point. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:12:04
but that wasnt the original point you made that you have to use bnb. fee is still low without bnb.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:43:59
unless the merchant doesn't want to deal with charge backs or doesn't accept your card and the only option is a digital currency.
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:44:34
Same could be said then vs the government. Running the On lightning network will most likely allow choice in what nodes you use at some point. So if the government is abusing power then avoid their nodes. Secondly never said it did hide wallets just make them even more difficult then it currently is now. If it was so easy to make the database you speak of why isn’t it done? only that because wallets are visible does not mean correlation = causation.  Even with heuristic methods it would be extremely hard to tie a wallet to a name even with small amounts of purchase history mainly because of the wallet owner wants to remain anonymous they can still split the same wallet when ever. Or just change seeds. You can track the money went here but what then? What if it’s owned by someone you think is chinese but moves again. You didn’t have enough info before and now it’s changed again. You have a god belief in coding that the solution you are suggesting above is not possible currently in our society. Unless the government controls every single isp in the world they will have little chance in building the app/program you are suggesting. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:00:34
You are charging the use case of crypto currency when you are trying to go from crypto to fiat. Now it’s a store of value not currency. As a form of currecncy it is impossible to Id a specific address with 100% certainty. Even then you could take it a step further and simply use a localbitcoins to trade for fiat. The argument isn’t how easy or hard it can be to use crypto but if it’s anyonymus or not. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:41:27
once again you do not have to use BNB for binance fees. This is also besides the original point about privacy. Don't let the internet hurt your feelings so bad that you feel you need to insult everyone in every reply you make. You are still not responding to the other points of made.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:39:21
you keep saying it will be monitored but once again provide no info on how.
Address does not = ID.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:06:40
Once again you are making the comparison that banks = wallet. This is not true. You can have many different seeds. P.O boxs are a thing as well. I'm confused by your metaphor as well. Why is the only use case for bitcoin shipping items? Internet services are a thing too. There are many uses that involve bitcoin that keep anonymity. Its already used as agruement against bitcoin as well. (silk road) 
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:51:11
You are calling it inflation when it is not. Inflation is when the total cap is changed not intrudicing it into the market. The bolivar is worth nothing because it’s printed to hell the same with any other inflation currency. Adding more supply is inflation adding already introduced supply is not. How many bitcoins will there be in 2020? We have a exact amount. How much USD will there be? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:35:53
That’s just incorrect the work to receive and validate blocks is managed by the pool but the protcol itself does not change or we would no longer be mining btc. Because they choose the blocks does not mean they also choose what is in the blocks. You will also notice the choice is based off bitcoin fees that you pay to send it. Also many people run their own node as it is very simple and if you are already mining might as well.
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:34:19
bitcoin does not have inflation. Total amount is set, introducing more bitcoin is not the same as it is already accounted for in the total supply.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:51:40
FYI for a lot of the people commenting about how China has all this mining power. Just because they are managing the pools does not mean the miners themselves are from China. Most asic pools have server locations you can connect to from anywhere in the world and mine from. They are not controlling the mining in any form, only managing the money from the pool to be paid out to the miners. (Google btc.com mining pools or antpools, both have North American servers).
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:55:05
Slush pool is a us based mining pool that regularly makes more then China pools. It’s my default pool as well.
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:19:40
You are saying inflation but it’s not inflation if you are introducing more supply that is already minted. We are not making new bitcoins when you are paid out for a block reward. They already are in the total supply just not owned yet. When central banks print more money they are adding to the total amount ever printed as there is no cap. This causes inflation. If we knew that no more money would ever be printed would there still be a inflation rate for the US dollar? You are saying unclaimed tokens = inflation which is just not true.
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:54:09
The default mining pool is a China pool on ASICS. Also not everyone knows the biggest pools don’t always mine the most. Remember correlations do not mean causation. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:57:51
There are US pools just mining in North America is most likely not as popular as in Asia is my best guess.
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:31:58
Correct when new money is issued, bitcoin is not issuing new bitcoin just unclaimed btc. The total amount will never change. This is not the same for most currencies. No new bitcoin is ever generated. Miner reward = reward. Moving already minted money around is not inflation. Minting more bitcoin would be but that is not what happens. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:52:08
Or it could double in price but their support has nothing to do with bitcoin price...
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:27:36
Unless you electricity is close to nothing you will be losing money. You also would not be mining bitcoin as asic is the only way to really mine now. You’d most likely be mining monero and etherium.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:19:08
I’m a assuming you know the defaults are root and root for password and user. If not it seems like indeed someone has a port in your network and isgetting in through a back door.

So to avoid explaining a lot about mining and different configs I will give you tldr for your card. 
While the base clock does affect mining speed its not really the speed we look at for cost effectiveness. So normally around 1100-1200mhz is my sweet spot on my rx580s, but this doesnt mean that you should have the same results because your base clock is the same. The reason for this is because mining is really running off the ddr5 ram that is packed into each gpu. This is also what made gaming gpus so sought after. So normally how to get the best performance is to actually under clock/ under volt your gpu and get the other settings correct. This above method also reduces strain and temps on the card by a significant amount. Hope this helped!

If that’s the case restore the firmware and the basic option is to not allow ssh connections until you reallow it
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:52:15
If you haven’t already bought one, you can get a sealed one off eBay that’s shipped in the U.S for free. Normally only 100$ more than bitmain and is shipped instantly.

its a "us vs the banks" mentality because at heart crypto is the first competition for banks that cant be shut down. Andre makes a good point about why we are not out to kill the banks but simply improve the system they work in.
