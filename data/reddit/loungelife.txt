Not a bad idea to just HODL.  I was around in 2014 when it crashed big.  I started trying to day trade against the new alt coins at the time, then ended up selling some BTC for almost nothing in 2015, as the market hadn't moved much.  HODL would have been a much better strategy.  We're still early in blockchain adoption/technology.

We just went through a time of frenzy.  It might be slow for awhile (weeks/months) but we're still early in the blockchain public adoption curve.  It'll pick up eventually.

My only issue with doing this is as of right now it greatly complicates my taxes at the end of the year.  So annoying.

This is what I don't understand.  The existence of bitcoin is in direct violation of what Unit and mmcakes say they want.  They are basically saying, "I want centralized power but I back a currency that is directly against that power by being decentralized."  That doesn't make sense.

As a member of the libertarian/in it for the technology/generally like the idea behind it group, I think this crash is a good thing.  It is most likely to cause an exodus of the speculators, at least for now.  I am hoping the focus of bitcoin now shifts toward using it for exchange and not hording it.  This means more stores accepting it and more people shopping/selling on bitmit or coinpurse.  There has been a lot of hording going on lately and if these coins are not used as a medium of exchange, then it is hard to call them a currency.

I agree that saving can be advantageous for the individual, but I think it cuts into the ability for bitcoin and other cryptos to function as a currency vs a commodity.  What got me thinking about this was this post:
Coming from someone who has been ebaying since 1999, I saw that and  came to the conclusion that few people actually use bitmit.  Then I factored in the retailers that currently use it.  Combined, it doesn't seem like bitcoin is really getting used as a currency.  Instead, it is functioning much more like a commodity that is being passed back and forth, compared to its relative USD.  While, some have made money off that, I worry that there are much better commodities with more real life purpose than a bitcoin, such as gold and silver.  Therefore, bitcoin would be pointless.  Then again, I might be impatient and need to wait for the "currency" aspect of bitcoin to develop further.  I want bitcoin and other cryptos to succeed, as I think they are important for a better future, compared to centralist fiat power.
