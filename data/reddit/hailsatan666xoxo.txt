Let's do that again next Wednesday when the btc is going to adjust again ��
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:13:03
Pathetic AND funny 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:50:50
Oh wait.. I misread
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:07:06
You know what you are getting yourself into upfront. Have you seen the Coinbase fees then..? See if it's cheaper over there! ��

Great to see that the censorship brigade is starting to downvote criticism again. Also not so edgy

No doge?

Looking at the btc/bch ratio of the last month I get the impression that it does not work like that.. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:19:06
I'm just gonna bite: cash ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:25:22
It's not a bch attack. It's just people abandoning btc for something else. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:37:00
You tell me where it is organised that people are massively dumping their btc. This reddit? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:49:54
Assuming you bought them for free
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:53:18
Legacy or cash?

Remindme! in 5 days
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:56:30

Any tethers released on the market today? Or is it the atomic swaps with ltc? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:59:04
If you're hodling you don't care about distractions
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:46:14
Bch has low fees. There's nothing to fix. Please don't ban me!��
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:43:03
Let's just see how this tether thing plays out.. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:04:21
So where is the scam part?

Betting with a pregnant woman seems like a lose-lose situation?

Everybody is an amateur. Just buy
