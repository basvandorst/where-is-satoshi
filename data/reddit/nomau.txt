I think it will go up a bit until the end of the year, maybe to 5k but I also think it will drop down again to 2.5-3k in Q1 2019. That's just my personal opinion/hope, nobody really knows.

Yeah me too and I have never seen it either. I only check the German Wikipedia page and I couldn't find it there so I assumed it was fake. TIL I guess.
