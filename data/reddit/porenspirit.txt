Correct here. Anything UP TO that level is taxed as the lower bracket. Only monies that go INTO the higher tax bracket are taxed like that.
If you make 150k and the tax bracket is for 130k, you pay the lower percentage on 130 and higher only on the 20.

Just be mindful of this rule in 2018 if you decide to sell some BTC for XMR or anything else. :)

want to join your club too. What is the ELI5 method you will use if the hardware breaks or gets lost?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:10:33
Haha - amen! Bitcoin.tax helps some, but I’m hoping for a coinbase level startup to solve this!

Cool. So the wallet is actually held at TREZOR, although I assume they cannot access it because they don’t have the seed. Are you still reliant on their service to be up and running? What happens if they decide to shutdown? Are my coins safe?  
(My wife asked this and I could not answer - haha)

Finally, how long or short can the pin be? 
Thanks guys - I think I’m sold. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:26:06
Thanks much. As far as losing it, what would someone have to do to gain access?
Appreciate your time, I know this is available online but it’s nice to hear from actual users.

Sure. Every single coin change - ethereum to litecoin for example will be a taxable event. People that own dozens of coins and trade a lot will have a muh harder time tracking and filing taxes for these trades.
I pretty much expected to be called stupid on Reddit by somebody without asking any context
Edit: read 
Edit2: for people like me that trade a lot back and forth, this will make my life difficult unless an exchange provides a tax form

I wish there was one overall thread for convos like this. I’m still waiting on Poloniex (exchange) support after being a customer for YEARS. Average response time, I hear, is 3 months. But I’m obviously frightened of any shenanigans in this field.

It hasn’t been that way this year though - you could just calculate cap gains from start to finish. I didn’t dump all my coins by any means, but it’s something i have to do now too.
Edit; I was only trying to provide a *possible* explanation why people are dumping- that’s all.

Donald Trumps dumbass tax plan.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:04:26
Read what I said again. I said it’s a taxable event that requires more work. How did you come to the conclusion I didn’t understand this?
Sheez. Reddit is rough.

Haha! Best flowchart ever. If people are confused, might need another line back to start :)

I made a lot of money with them mining eth when it first came out. It was like $4. With that said, you can roll the dice on a new coin there, but as for existing ones like BTC (and probably everything now), forget it. I got screwed by that Lifelong Bullshit too.

I think the IRS (in the states) figured this little trick out. The latest tax code says currency I think for this reason.
I think the code before asked “what was the value at the time you mined and it’s USD value” vs the code now really states one of two things: Income or Capital Gains.
This is my understanding of it, at least.

I have thought about this a lot, even to the extreme of considering building an app.
The problem I have, is I don’t know how many people want to be legit with their bitcoin tax. I think we all need to show the government that we can give them money!
Now to answer your question:
Did you make this mining? If so, it’s the same as income. Add it as additional income on your taxes. 
Did you invest your own money and trade, etc? In that case, it’s 20% (could be wrong here) for long term. More for short term. Write this as capital gains on your taxes.
Finally, I think I can determine tax amounts by looking at a wallet. That’s why I want to build a service for this, but don’t think anyone would pay me for it.
Sorry to pivot your original point OP- I’m very glad you asked this though. I wish more people would be concerned as well for their taxes.

Hey, thanks  I hadn’t heard of that. This is a lot of what I was looking for, just lacks the community aspect of it. And the ability to say “we’ve payed the government 1m dollars this month/year”.
I guess I saw a different vision, but I’m glad this site is around, thanks much!
Edit: 
Also, this site appears to import from trades only. I want to ask the user to paste in their wallet address, and I could do the rest from reading the blockchain. Figured I’d use blockchain.info, but they didn’t even respond to me. Must be big business only :/
