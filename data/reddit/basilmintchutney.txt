Lol, I'm talking about the **BITCOIN** network, not lightning. The majority of transactions happen on the bitcoin network anyway.

Good point. There's an attack vector I haven't heard before. Any work done in this area?
So In theory, I'm at a coffee shop and I take control of the network and MITM all traffic. I intercept price conversion and make each bitcoin worth $1000. When my victim sends bitcoin, his wallet will send a usd price update request. Now because I own the network, I'll send the crafted packet to my victims wallet saying 'btc=$1k'

Bitcoin is not equipped to oppose the military (gang) governments (thieves). They have tacking capabilities for btc. They will track all your bitcoin in order to try to keep that power. Be careful.

Except they have stopped/arrested the people transacting them because Bitcoin is an open ledger.

The biggest attack has been Blockstream by blocking bitcoin's potential. I want Gavin back! Get Bitcoin back to the people!

There are better digital currencies like DASH that are faster, cheaper, and more secure than Bitcoin.
Make sure you do your own reading and definitely check out its not "fake" as OP claims. There's a lot of competition, so be careful and do your research.

What particularly fooled you? They state two different options to buy, Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Core ([ Did you not ask yourself what the difference is?
