So if this is 2 months old, who's the new CTO?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:27:32
I won't be hodling my pounds that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:28:32
How did you get that wrong? It even says – BBC News at Ten.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:28:17
You know he wanted to, but he kept himself under control because he was on national television.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:59
Ha yeh right, this is a bullshit made up story.
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:24:44


Kind of like the dirty Jews, really.

Gold is simple. Bitcoin's future depends on a hightech infrastructure which an economy in serious decline may not be able to provide.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:03:52
Gold may work quite well in an economy that is in decline. Bitcoin, I'm not so convinced.
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:27:21
Why is holding Bitcoin more of a lifeline than holding Euros?
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:53:25
It seems you're allowed to harass people so long as you have the correct views. That's the PC aspect.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:30:53
In the UK it's "[Hear, hear]( never seen it as "hear, here".
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:14:09
And bought eth.
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:24:46
It can be programmed to do what anyone wants though, not just banks, it is a computer (albeit very slow) that can run multiple simultaneous programs - and no one has control over what you run, so long as you have ether.

What DoS attack - I don't remember any mention of a DoS attack on Who was being attacked?
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:40:13
This is an out-of-touch aristocracy more interested in preserving it's power and wealth than in serving the people - vive la revolution!

60 what?
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:04:18
It could be on any day before then. Apparently the average decision is announced about 3 days before the deadline.
@_date: 2016-03-04 09:59:44
"the bitcoin protocol" would be better than bitcoin too - in fact I vote this subreddit be taken down immediately and replaced with @_date: 2017-03-01 19:04:33

@_date: 2016-03-01 10:00:14
6 day old account accusing everyone else of sockpuppeting.

Seems to me they have a Mountain to climb.
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:52:11


And you think you can make a call with a high degree of accuracy about the long term value of bitcoin? If so, what is it?
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:43:14
I read it. It doesn't change the fact that the leprechauns at core want to keep blocks small to further their own agenda.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:10:00
Are you talking to yourself?
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:28:57


Yet you said it. You're not being very logical here.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:09:03
Ideologies are fine, they don't commit you to anything.
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:07:58
How is ethereum more centralised than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:15:33


– 
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:45:58
Scared about what?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:18:56


Nonsense, it's not everyone versus the miners, you've spent way too long here if you believe that.


See, this is why you're clearly deluded. You need to get out into the real world a bit more.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:44:17
Yes, an increase with a hidden agenda.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:50:54
It's not the one thing. It was the first of a generation of new things.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:02:17
I've always quite liked conspiracy theories. Of course it's hard to determine their truth content, but scare me they do not.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:42:41


No he doesn't.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:26:23




It seems you have no understanding of ethereum whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:29:32
Whatever your preferences in this instance, it's a matter of logic, not science.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:00:23


Yes, this gets to the core of the matter.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:16:58
"The earth orbits the sun" is not an argument either.
Does that make it less true?
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:44:51
Oh, ok, I'm glad everyone's changed their minds. Time to fork and increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:00:38
Except bitcoin markets aren't closed at weekends.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:11:05
So you're saying that morally, coercion is better that secession?

Which cryptocurrencies count as a currency and which ones don't?
@_date: 2016-06-25 11:23:12
It's not doing bad for a currency that has been in continuous use for 5000 years.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:51:24
How small does a transaction have to be to be called a microtransaction?
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:23:59
It's ok, it's only the investors that might flippen.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:49:52
Assuming that by getting popular, you mean being as popular as bitcoin is now, then yes.
If you're setting the bar significantly higher for eth than btc, then perhaps not :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:48:42
Ah really? – I thought it was actual bitcoin discussion that was banned here!
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:28:50
Working is a subjective thing...
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:50:37
A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin that can be sent under the current protocol, so defining a bitcoin as 10^8 satoshis isn't *completely arbitrary*. I mean you could define it reasonably as some other power of 10 or even power of 2, but given all the possible choices, this is a infinitesimally small subset.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:10:26
Super litecoin doesn't exist.
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:10:00
You obviously enjoy talking to anuses.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:58:29
You mean more grounded.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:50:10


Which community is that?


I thought the point of bitcoin was that miners should act in their own interests and not be guilt-tripped in to doing things.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:38:00
Yeh, apparently here the only cryptocurrency that counts is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:49:27
But segwit does a lot of other things that many people don't want. Why not separate out the 2mb block size increase as it seems to be less controversial?
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:36:48
Sounds like Deutsche Bank.
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:06:46
When does rootstock go live? Is that before or after segwit?
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:05:31
What if they shut it down, then move on to the next Chinese exchange?
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:35:22
My anus has more sense in it than your mouth.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:05:46
They want confirmation Assange is alive.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:47:10
I think your suggestion is significantly less likely than mine.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:51:30
See other existing cryptos that are better than bitcoin, e.g. ethereum.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:04:57
Haha, that's such a bull shitty excuse. Replace the concept, and problem solved, voila!
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:39:44
Unlikely because the protocol isn't fundamentally limiting it.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:57:33
Ah yes, the very arbitrary number 100,000,000.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:18:33
In that case why do we need BTC? Litecoin sounds so much better.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:10:43


Not if its rape. That's the very definition of rape, sexual relation without consent. You might need to go to counselling of some kind, so you can understand what rape is before you proceed with life.
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:48:12
not if you're being raped
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:55:15
Not so sick of them that you can't come in to one to read and comment, though.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:07:03
Nope, by definition it's sex and violence. Otherwise it wouldn't be rape.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:20:10
Failure because of too much demand is still failure.
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:52:04
Nope, it can be both. Did that ever cross your mind?
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:50:55
Was out driving the other day, wanted to park the car, but couldn't because there were no parking spaces, so I had to keep driving and driving. There were more expensive parking spaces, but I'm not rich and couldn't afford them, so I gave up and drove home.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:09:53
95% ~~consensus~~ consensual is not the same as 95% good. Sometimes you've just got to lie back and think of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:08:46
You mean 95%, and apparently 50% of women prefer chocolate.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:51:30


How can Bitfinex/Tether have the fiat they're supposed to have when they have no USD banking facilities?
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:13:23
I don't see that quote anywhere on that page.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:05:27
I guess, I'm still in shock at the whole affair.
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:01:35
He knows that Ethcore exists and many of the names there. It doesn't therefore follow that he knows about every project they have in the pipeline.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:06:15
I haven't insulted you, just pointed out the obvious truth to anyone who has any knowledge on the matter.
@_date: 2016-02-19 18:59:20
That explains a lot.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:18:14
He's not shorted, he's stated before that he believes the price will rise on Bitfinex in just the same way it did at Gox.
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:18:02
The same principals are involved in Bitfinex and Tether, and it's pretty clear that behind the scenes actions are being coordinated between these two "independent" companies.


So your biggest complaint about all of this is the Fed. Seriously? Not the fact that the company providing the service is lying their ass off?


Yes and it works because its supposed to be backed to the USD. Except its most likely not any more. So investors have a right to be extremely wary, even if you think they don't.
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:15:59
I haven't used any insulting language until now, you stupid lying cunt. As someone who bought into the presale, your concerns are entirely wasted on me.
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:58:01
USDT is supposed to be backed one for one by USD. That it in reality it is not, and is not even close to being backed one for one, and the risk is borne entirely by the customer is far from "entirely non-controversial".
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:28:24
I don't know where you got this from but you're talking crap. To be honest I doubt you believe it yourself.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:03:56


Where does he say that? Try reading harder.
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:41:43
That's also true for bitcoin, and any stock for that matter.
@_date: 2012-09-16 10:10:08
QE3 was priced in but this is more like QE3,4,5,.... without end.
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:17:25
For an asset of last resort, bitcoin has been very flat of late.
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:03:16
Haha, what on God's green earth are you blathering on about? 
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:37:08
So what does "money in the bank" mean if it doesn't mean actual money in the bank?
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:24:48
Did you give yourself gold too?
@_date: 2016-09-24 14:14:28
Which corner?
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:27:49
Ah right, I had an older cached version in my browser without the most recent news.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:28:53
So which cryptocurrencies is Woz supporting (hodling?) now then?
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:33:50
And what's the approximate likelihood that a given transaction won't be replayed?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:13:02


So how would one make a transaction in the right way, given that a significant proportion of your coin's value may be on the other chain?
@_date: 2011-07-06 21:34:15
But I tell you, if you was to make a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away. Not even the threat of miserable death would keep you from trying to add 10,000 more. Ten, you'd want to get twenty-five; twenty-five you'd want to get fifty; fifty, a hundred. Like roulette. One more turn, you know. Always one more.
@_date: 2011-07-06 12:38:35
You sound emotional.
@_date: 2016-10-12 11:19:00
It's not the price of financial privacy, it's the price for not being used much.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:10:39
Well I guess the run had to come to an end eventually.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:30:13
Give it another 6 months.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:42:35
Yes back in those days, Sunny, you could go to work for 8 hours a day, and then go home. They even gave you two days a week when you didn't have to think about work!
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:05:44
Wouldn't you like to have the value of your non-forked bitcoins as well as your forked ones? Especially since most of the mining power will be staying there.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:36:19
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:53:52


Take it to \honey.
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:37:13
Someone's preparing to sell.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:21:20
Nonsense, absolutely nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:53:30
From which exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:54:56


Only in a completely useless way.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:10:04
You can chose your own rules, but you can't choose your own consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:09:54
More like North Corea, right now.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:23:35
And what? The miners are just supposed to feel so sorry for the users that they're willing to lose money themselves?
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:54:27
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation does what needs must.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:26:40


You mean like an altcoin?
