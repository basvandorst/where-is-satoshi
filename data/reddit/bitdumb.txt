I wouldn't have a clue how to even begin to do that, but thanks anyway.
Your other advice is very sound - pint here I come.

Thank you for your reply.
I don't quite understand: if 2MB blocks become the standard and I am on Bitcoin Core which does not support 2MB blocks, how can Core handle these bigger blocks?
I am not a supporter of HF (whatever that is) or of any other viewpoint. Just a naive user who wants to make sure I do whatever is necessary to preserve my bitcoins (well, fractions thereof anyway).

Phew. That's very much worth knowing. Thank you.

Not sure where to ask this question, but I'll try here.
I run Bitcoin Core 0.14.2 on my laptop with a wallet with a small amount of bitcoin in it.
I keep reading that Bitcoin Core developers are anti-SegWit2X. What does this mean for folks like me who run Bitcoin Core?
Does it mean our bitcoin are in danger of being on the 'wrong side' of a fork, for example? Should I move my bitcoin somewhere else?
This is all very confusing and perturbing for people who really haven't got a clue what SegWit, a soft fork or a hard fork actually is.

Questions on behalf of dumb users who run Bitcoin Core 0.14.2 with a wallet.
1. Core supports SegWit, so we're OK running Core for now. Is that correct?
2. If/when(?) the blocksize increases to 2MB, will a new release of Bitcoin Core support that? Or will we have to switch to some other bitcoin software?
Thank you.
EDIT: to whoever downvoted: why?

What would that mean in practice? Would Bitcoin Core show I had twice as much bitcoin? Or do I somehow suddenly have two wallets...? Sorry to be such a dummy!

Thanks again.
Maybe I'll open an account with blockchain.info and move my bitcoin there and let them worry about the software when, if, it or something else happens sooner, later or sometime, which would potentially leave my little bit of coin stranded.

Thank you for this clear and swift reply.
So does that mean Bitcoin Core will fade away?
And, out of interest, what would be the problem of holding bitcoin on an exchange, and would that same problem apply to wallets such as blockchain.info?
