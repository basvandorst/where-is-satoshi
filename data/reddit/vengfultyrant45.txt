No it wasn’t a mining fee. I was talking about how the transaction fee on Coinbase was 15 dollars even to send 50 dollars of BTC to binance.

Very interesting pattern over the last 7 days. It’s trying to break through the ceiling of 610 Billion (Marker cap) it has touched it 3 times at least in the last 7 days according to the coin market cap chart. 
This week we will see if it can break through the ceiling of 600 Billion and push to 650 Billion.
The resistance level on the downside is Around 550 Billion. It has touched this resistance at least 2 times, we will see if it touched there again today or continues to push up.

It took me 5 hours, finally confirmed. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:15:23
Yeah I should have used Ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:05:46

Transaction times are so so so so slow. What’s going on? It’s taking 5+ hours to send bitcoin.

Even though I am losing a shit ton in fees? That basically make my profit zero?

I don’t know where else I can buy crypto for fiat. I sent it to a wallet cause I didn’t feel comfortable holding on an exchange. But is it really even worth the trouble

Time for them to launch their own crypto like Kodak did.

Eh I only bought 500 dollars worth. But I should have an exit strategy. It’s definitely going down to at least 8k but not sure from there 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:14:07
I’ve lost 50% 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:44:28
Blood bath in the stock market too
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:16:03
It’s going down to at least 7,000... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:09
If it drops any lower I will start being in the red and I bought in right after thanksgiving 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:28:38
It’s okay I could afford to lose the amount I invested. I put 25% into etheruem when it was 800, then 50% in a coin that I bought at 24 cents and it is now at 12 cents, all time high though was 70 cents so I thought I was okay. Then 25% into Vechain when it was just below 6 dollars. I think I am just bad at investing lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:11:31
I see a very strong resistance at 0 dollars ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:34:33
It’s down 10% in less than a week
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:27:26
Use to be up 200% (2,000 dollars) now only up 200.
