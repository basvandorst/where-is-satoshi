Heck, you can't even use things like promotional codes to offer content that can be bought using in-app purchases. Probably because these codes could be sold externally? Either way, Apple's "sandboxing" is really starting to annoy me.

I consider myself a socialist and I am perfectly fine with centralizing certain things away from the government. Private healthcare providers are fine with me, as long as they don't discriminate me for being in a wheelchair. I'm totally cool with private schools for those who can afford it, as long as there's also a public option.


Or, and I'm just spitballing here, maybe we could tackle the corruption problem? Plenty of governments seem to be handling responsibility quite well; it can be done. (In other words: "corrupt government with responsibilities or no/ small government" is a false dichotomy.)


Why would a private enterprise write laws? Why would a private enterprise care about education, or crime or affordable healthcare? And even assuming that they can and do take on these things, at what price? Private enterprises exist to make money. Almost by it's very definition a private enterprise exists to serve itself, not to serve the public. 
In addition, who decides which enterprise gets to do what? A commission? Some sort of governing body, perhaps?


Yes, we think it's an accomplishment we haven't forgotten how to breathe and want to be rewarded... (That was sarcasm.) Really, the ideology's in the name: social. We believe that it's unreasonable that a single accident can render you bankrupt, or that you need to work a full-time job in order to afford your education. So we figure it's better to join efforts (and funds) and create a social distribution of wealth and responsibility. Not only is it a decent thing to do to your fellow people, there's also a selfish aspect to it: you have (literal) assurance that if something goes wrong, you can get back on your feet. That if you feel a weird lump, you can always go to the doctor.


And until there's a way for you to also unsubscribe from all public roads, emergency rooms, police and firefighters, parks and inventions made from scientific advancements created by government-funded agencies, I am perfectly fine with that.

I think it's fair to say that that's a point where the two differ then. Socialists are "social libertarians" (i.e.: personal freedoms) while imposing some fiscal mandates.
If you want to go full personal freedoms, you'd have no laws:
*"murder is then not allowed, as it is the antithesis of personal freedom; murder is telling a person what he must think and (not) do and say; murder is when a person is forced to abstain from something that he would do were it not for the threat of violence."*
(PS: Taxation is not about telling a person what they must think or say, nor is there an immediate threat of violence. Yes, they are required to pay, but they can (vocally) be against it all they want. The penalty will likely be financial, followed by social (jail time) before violent.)

Playing devil's advocate here, it really is. You are being forced to pay for a slew of facilities services that you otherwise may not have done. Heck, you may even believe public roads are the work of the devil; being forced to pay for them can be an ideological problem for some.
(Disclaimer: I am very much pro-taxes.)

Same here; was totally expecting it to drop to $60 before recovering.

Never heard of Transferwise, but I can just log into my (Dutch) bank account and make SEPA transactions for no additional fees whatsoever. Definitely the easiest way I've discovered and saves the hassle of converting USD -&gt; SLD -&gt; BTC or similar.

That kind of makes sense. If Tor really isn't "safe" though, why wasn't SR taken down earlier? And why only him and not, for instance, sellers?

Oh, nice! Definitely something to keep in mind then, thanks! =)

Use BitStamp. =) No verification needed and the prices are generally a tad lower there than on MtGox. (Just waiting for my bank to finally finish processing my second deposit...)
