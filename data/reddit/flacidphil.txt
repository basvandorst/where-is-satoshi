The maximum debit interchange fee is $0.21 - 
Not that any of that matters, because your point is moot. I just sent a friend $0.05 through Venmo, neither of us will be charged a penny to send or withdraw the transaction (though I do think he needs to have $1.00 to withdraw). -

Yes, that's exactly the problem. A huge obstacle for Crypto's to overcome. The pull system generally benefits both the consumer and the seller when it comes to subscription services (which is the direction many things are going, video games, Amazon Pantry, in App Purchases, the list goes on and on). Until there's more benefit for both parties to use a push system it won't be widely adapted. It's the money of the internet but it's a pain to use on many internet services. Goods are easy enough, but for companies like Github it doesn't make as much sense.

Many people follow transaction volume as a metric for Bitcoin growth (which is a bad idea IMO), so there is motive for some whale to drop a small percentage of his holdings every year in hopes it causes bubbles. Some people estimate the fake volume costs $30k/yr, that's damn cheap if it can convince people Bitcoin is healthier than it really is.

There are some pretty gaping flaws to Bitcoin that could be corrected with an alt coin. Sure Bitcoin is enduring for now, but that might just be the first movers advantage playing out.

Anything consumer facing will be affected by herd mentality. Look at Apple products, they have almost a cult following, and people will buy their products despite there being better or more logical choices (by more logical I mean cheaper and better suited for their needs. Internet browsing doesn't require a $2k Macbook Pro).. 
The end idea is that people will gravitate towards systems that work. Paypal might have some problems, but for 95% of their users I bet it works perfectly. I used it the other week for concert tickets and it was quick, easy, and my goods were delivered perfectly (awaiting downvotes).
I still think the biggest problem for Github accepting BTC (and most other online companies) is the fact they can't pull transactions. Push only payments are a difficult thing for subscription based online companies to accept.
And you're absolutely right, the Bitcoin community is definitely NOT immune to herd mentalities.

Cool story about your GPU mining, but a bit naive to think you mining with a gpu 3 years ago is the same as the mining race these days. You now have giant mining companies that are squeezing out the small miners (like yourself), who used to hold at least a portion of what they mined. Now everything must be sold and the miners still struggle.
What's changed is the hashrate. You mining at $5? Cool, nice and easy, people can mine and hold at home. Now? Giant ASIC farm or bust. Seriously, you can't look at this chart and say nothing about mining has changed -

Waiters prefer cash in tips over a tip on a card for a reason. They get the money right then and they can spend it.
While bitcoin could do something like that eventually, no waiter on earth is going to want to be bugged to learn about and set up a new currency while they are on their shift in order to get their tip. Honestly that would be offensive to most waiters. They want to get paid with something they know, and offering bitcoin would sound like a scam to most waiters.

All depends on the trend you want to look at. Anytime you look at a trendline since the beginning of something, it's going to point upwards unless it has already failed. You can look at Segway's and Snuggies, both experienced a hype bubble and have fallen since then. If I look at the chart of sales since inception it's definitely up big time, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily smart for me to invest in those.
Just pointing towards 2008 and showing the growth since then is silly. You're doing yourself a disservice by not taking a hard look at what the price has done over the last year, now that the technology is much more widely known.

So how does that net-positive for Github or any other service? This is the same reason porn sites haven't taken a loving to Bitcoin, they can't charge your card for you. By implementing Bitcoin you make the user have a to make a conscious decision and effort to pay for another months service, rather than just pulling the money out and letting them decide when to cancel. Most companies would lose money this way, being able to pull transactions is HUGE for online companies, without it they would have far fewer monthly subscribers.
An ethical grey area? Sure. But in the end it looks to me like they'd lose money by implementing BTC, just from the attrition rate of people to lazy to reload their wallet and go through the whole process when it comes time to pay for another month.

It's definitely a problem! I won't deny that. It's a shame we can't look at data for lost/corrupted wallets, stolen Bitcoin, etc.. I'd be curious to see how it stacks up vs credit cards when you account for the scale of payments processed.
Because from your article, it looks like Credit Card fraud is dropping big time. Security loops are constantly being closed and people are becoming much more savvy about how to protect themselves when purchasing things with cards. All in all, credit card fraud is a problem that could end up mostly solved. To quote the opening statement of the page you linked:

So yes, it's a problem, but it's an overstated problem and we don't really have the means to see if Bitcoin would solve it any faster than credit card companies already are.

Maybe for lazy trading. But if I buy 10 coins at $900, why keep holding those overvalued coins as the price dwindles? Instead I could sell, let it drop, and by 3x as many coins at $300. Then if price does go to the moon I have 3x more profit than I used to have.

Gotta look at your userbase and whether they are the type that could make the switch to Crypto. If you implemented Paypal now you would have access to 165 million active user accounts that make 11.6 Million payments per day. Bitcoin (very likely) has under 1 million total users, and can hit about 110k transactions per day on a good day. 
While you may not be able to use Paypal, the effect is the same. By going crypto only you cut down on your potential customer base drastically. It's just not widely used enough to use as a primary payment form if others are available.
Plus, check out the Mozilla A/B testing. Carts are VERY delicate things, and abandoned carts are a huge issue for any industry. Make it more complicated for the user and they'll go to another website quickly.

In the US there's a law in place in most big cities, if you puke in the cab and refuse to pay they'll call the police. That's a good rule to have imo, if someone pukes in a cab they are out for hours till it's clean and the smell has gone away.

Was anyone really convinced by that post? OP sends in a weak "We want to pay with Bitcoin." message to their helpdesk and gets the typical "sorry we don't have it but we'll work on getting it!" response. That's the standard canned answer to almost every feature request ever sent in to any tech company.

If I invest $10k in an index fund today it will conservatively be worth $20k in 15 years without touching it. If I put $10k in Bitcoin and it continues going sideways for years I don't earn anything. It's the electronic version of shoving your cash savings under your mattress.

All shares had to be held for a year before they can be sold. I believe that makes it impossible for anyone to break even by selling their shares now. No incentive for ask bids to be put up unless that user wants out of Bitcoin and is willing to eat a loss. GBTC is dead in the water.

Mozilla found that adding a Bitcoin option reduced their donations by 7.5%, or $140k through their donation drive ( ). Others have found it extremely difficult to implement ( ). Hundreds of others have implemented BTC payments, but dropped support for them because no one used Bitcoin to buy anything; physical stores can't justify the cost of keeping employees trained on it and online stores generally drop to a couple transactions per month after the initial launch hype. Plenty of reasons why it isn't widely accepted.

Wait, adoption of something didn't happen in 6 years during the 1870's?? No fucking way. I mean, with all those horse drawn buggies and steamboats you would think technology would spread the globe like wildfire. What a different world it was right?
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:28:35
Wait, you mean to tell me that credit card usage was low in the 1920's?? No fucking way.

For everyone who hates seeing a stupid splash page and paltry announcement, just remove the lab suburl.
It's a BTC purchasing and storage system. Offering another way for people to buy BTC without actually holding it themselves.
Rates are a $5.00 deposit fee with a 5.5% brokerage fee - 
They've apparently had a physical service since 2013 in Fraser Valley (BC Canada?) -  - Anyone have experience with them?
Not too sure about this one.

Ooo yes, I like that. Pit poor people against rich people.
Anywho, doesn't matter. That's covered by my statement still.
If they think the value is going to go up, they won't sell (no incentive for ask bids = future price is better than current price).
If they think it's going downhill and want out of Bitcoin they're willing to eat a loss (there is incentive for ask bids).
So unless you're suggesting that the people who bought into BIT over a year ago (AKA Bitcoin enthusiasts) want out en masse, GBTC is dead in the water.

maybe because there still wasn't an effective network built to support credit cards? You know what else, I just realized fire probably didn't get worldwide adoption within 6 years of it's invention... The wheel probably didn't either. Woah. Whole new world.

$300mm is chump change in the VC world, it's not going to be the savior you're looking for. Dozens of individual companies have raised more money than the entire BTC space and still gone out of business. VC money takes the shotgun approach, throw money at everything and hope for one to become the next Facebook, knowing that most investments will fail.

Hmmm, sounds really similar to a certain community dedicated to pumping bitcoin because they have a financial incentive to...

Oh you know, just 7.5 Million active subscribers. Much higher than the 200k daily bitcoin users or the 2 million wallets ever created.

And then I'd clearly have to go on and mention that purse.io is a haven for stolen credit cards 
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:03:46
Haha I'm with you, but people love old games. But it's not like it hasn't been updated in years, they released a new expansion in November and their subscribers broke 10 million when it came out. It's definitely still one of the most popular mmorpgs

And I'd most certainly have to observe that while credit cards do have a huge design flaw, most schemes don't involve me purchasing goods with stolen credit cards. While my card number might be stolen by someone, my bank will most certainly reimburse me. However if I use a stolen credit card to purchase goods, which I'd never do outside of purse.io, I become an accomplice for credit card theft.
Who cares if credit cards have a design flaw, I see no real consequences of that in my day to day life. However if I use Purse.io, I open myself up to liability because I receive goods purchased with stolen money. You're trying to shoehorn in an argument about a donkey when I'm talking about oranges.

Welcome to Bitcoin! The revolutionary online currency that anyone can use, with essentially 0 fees. To join the club, please send a down payment of $119 in order to store your money offline.
Blows my mind that the best an online currency can do is an expensive offline hardware wallet.

Ummm... Yeah. Spotify and Pandora were both started about 7 years ago, and there were a number of streaming services before that. Stop talking out your ass.

Sort of like when Firefox implemented BTC donations and lost 7.5% revenue per visitor when they displayed BTC as a donation option? 
Tell me again how it's obviously going to 'become a "thing" fairly soon'?
EDIT: Follow up post highlighting different ways of A/B testing revealed no significant change from the 7.5% loss per user -

You realize it's possible to switch the currency it's mining right? Miners can and do switch the currency they mine all the time. If another coin becomes more profitable for a majority of Miners, they'd absolutely have incentive to switch.
