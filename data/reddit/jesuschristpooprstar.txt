YES! This is the proof I need. When I go to work and I go on break I will use their printer to make copies of this so I can show it to the librarians and other people who don't let me give bitcoins. It shouldn't be my fault that the librarian won't take fiat. If I could afford magazines I would just buy them instead of taking them from the f----- library anyway. Sorry for cussing.

If you think about it, the REAL difficulty in bitcoin is not just the numbers, it's making people in RL (Reality) understand how it's the future. It's just like Einstein when he tried over 600 times to invent the light bulb. Everyone kept telling him he couldn't, but then he got it right. We just have to keep trying.

Is there something like this without all the carbs? You wreck your body by eating doughnut and candy bars, so just keep in mind, candy bars are still carbs. I want cheese, hot dogs, good stuff like that.

It's not funny because I had to get $46 in USD and it takes forever to sell BTC. All my money is BTC now. But if you seriously want it to pass to people, then I can post it.

No way was he a librarian. Satoshi wanted us to have great coins so we could get in early &amp; go to the moon. It wasn't something where you're supposed to be quiet, and if you bring stuff back late you have to give them fiat money. I hate librarians and there is no way Satoshi was one.
