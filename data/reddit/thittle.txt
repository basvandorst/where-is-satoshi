Man that’s completely bullshit... hope you get an answer and update us here..
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:43:09
Maybe they batch transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:39:43
TOMORROW

Satoshi bless you 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:46:38
The exchange I would think but Idk
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:29:05
Guide pls
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:41:15
That’s some quality customer support over $90k. 
Document everything. Don’t let them fuck you around. Hope it works itself out soon..
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:12:11
No real point. I’m actually hoping we start referring to bitcoins as satoshis someday, because as of right now my only desire for one bitcoin is I don’t like having just a fraction of a whole coin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:17:17
Uh huh
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:32:21
When bitcoin was at 11.5k, you couldn’t pay less than 13k on coinbase... their premium is absolutely insane but now that the price has came up a lot it’s only ~100$ premium.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:15:55
Are you dumb? If the price skyrocketed and reversing at your own will was a thing please explain how that would work for the exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:43:53
it’s the Tupac of crypto. Even if it dies it will live on
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:49:23
This is unrelated but have you been playing much dota on the 7.07 patch? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:39:45
You won’t be mining BTC with a GPU. Look into an S9.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:10:22
Huh? I’m hodling and the money I have in crypto I’m 100% willing to lose completely. 
BTC either makes it or it doesn’t but I’m a believer in the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:43:09
You won’t get shit especially right now when it costs us $30 to send anything 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:54:53
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:38:46
With layer 2 solutions being implemented like segwit and LN the blockhain will have space freed up allowing 20sat/byte transactions to be more than enough
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:01
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:52:01
Try the second thing I mentioned
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:10:15
I’m scared of ripple taking over. And I’m a believer longterm in bitcoin. Will people come back to bitcoin or is it heading downhill?
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:38:52
There isn’t that much possible combinations. It can be brute forced. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:31:48
Why does this seem sketchy..
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:34:39
They have the same backend but they’re still fucking different when it comes to purchasing, wallets etc. you sound like your head is up your ass I know the premium I paid when Gemini, bittrex, kraken and Binance were all 500-1000 cheaper at the time compared to coinbase artificially propping the price up 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:33:56
You can buy $50 or $200 at a time. You can buy in, you just don’t want to because you’ve seen the price rise.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:06:59
Is it safe to post your words here?
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:18:47
Go beg elsewhere like outside Walmart dude
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:57:39
I bought on coinbase when BTC dipped to 11.5k a few days ago and they had a fucking $1000 premium on purchases. Now they have a $100 premium. Hate these fucks
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:07:56
I’ll give bitcoin if it didn’t cost $30 in fees to send $10 right now
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:20:03
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:48:29
Opposite 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:36:43
The genesis block was created via custom coding done by satoshi himself. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:50:41
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:04:07
I’ll load the boat under 10k
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:13:05
Thank you for this! Go BTC:)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:06:48
I see your point. It may not work due to it being less ‘physical’ than say, a 200 year old silver coin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:33:50
If you really want to honor it, send them the amount in LTC instead. You aren’t sending BTC for 30 cents right now.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:28:34
Wait for fees to go down, have to HODL for now
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:38:23
Wtf lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:24:34
I’ll donate you AIDS
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:03:36
Throw another $200 in, why not  bit :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:45:10
Hoping this takes us down a bit, I’d love to buy more lower.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:59:42
Hopefully merchants just set up a channel to a major exchange and then pay a monthly fee (no idea) to keep it open. User should be just fine..? And not need anything.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:57:30
Maybe they batched a lot of transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:54:31
Create your node!

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:16:48
Could I get the tips too?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:15:57
Coinbase. Not gdax. 
No limit orders on CB.

Mined after first genesis block via custom code
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:37:36
I bought in this week 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:52:30
Ripple is not a currency lmao
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:10:46
Not trading it, hodling
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:03:21
I’ve put over a thousand hours into actively trading in the stock market this year. I’ve made over 100% returns on my investments, but I can’t help but feel like shit watching crypto be thousands of percents higher.
I’ve watched BTC since 2012, and just this month I’ve finally started purchasing through my coinbase account I created years ago... I went ahead and picked up .1 BTC at 14,500, and I’ll continue to hodl and buy any dips lower with the ultimate goal of at least joining the 21 million club.   
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:23:21
No. Fees.
If no fees, maybe, but probably not
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:42:22
Max amount of bitcoin to ever exist is capped at 21 million. So if I can own 1 bitcoin I’ll have 1/21,000,000 Of the supply.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:39:01
It was there a month ago, I’m in already but don’t think that it can’t dip under 10 or even 5k when real selling occurs and sentiment changes. 
I’m not a bear and I’m a hodler but I’m a realist 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:49:15
Buy dogecoin with LTC or Eth, until they implement segwit fees are high across the entire BTC network.
Or, transfer your BTC for free from coinbase to gdax and then gdax to kraken for free
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:10:22
Agree. I bought 1btc a week ago and it’s not available for another week 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:28:43
I can cleave you pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:51:08
Buy the dip if you have any other expendable fiat, otherwise hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:57:58
BTC goes up and BTC goes down, you cannot explain that 
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:30:09
Love you guys.
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:04:27
I think we’ll see 8300 this weekend.

What do you mean by this? The trezor I bought from amazon didn’t let me make my own seed. You get to choose the words?
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:48:15
What if I’d like to do volunteer work and feed everyone that I possibly can? Like buy thousands of pounds of rice and cook it up and give water etc. will the mafia still hate me?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:18:40
It was down for a few. Mine is working again.

What’s the $5 wrench attack
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:56:15
I love two hours away from here, and have seen the hirosaki cherry blossoms and castle. It's amazing!
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:10:06
Hopefully we never go under!!! I’m actually over, as I have a couple different wallets on my Trezor.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:42:28
How do I add the 25th word
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:21:12
I’ve lived there for 3 and a half years, currently Korea. 
Tokyo again from next year. Yourself?
