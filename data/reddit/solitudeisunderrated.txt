Vitalik is enabling scammers flood the industry and stealing away from our market share. That’s his sin. Also all the devs I respect hate him for being such a know it all scammer enabler so I don’t doubt for a minute that he is one young useful fool. I don’t think anyone here doubts either. He is making our precious store of value lose face every single day and I will hate him for that forever. Thank god for nick szabo, giancarlao zucco and others calling out his bs though. Without them I would have never known the true face of the little scam enabler.
Erik is clearly an enemy of bitcoin. Like jr said so since 2013. He had started with Satoshi dice and He has been attacking bitcoin left and right. Last one being the segwit2x nonsense which almost destroyed my stored value in bitcoin. Thank god for Greg maxwell and for though for preventing it.
I hope you are convinced that they are enemies. Charlie lee is also an enemy having created light coin  but so far he is doing a good job defending bitcoin against scammers so i will cut him some slack. He also sold his Litecoins so he at least is transparent about Litecoins true value.
I hope I convinced you brother, this is a dog eat dog world now. Watch out. Peace.

There are just so many of them. Jihan Wu, Craig Wright, Vitalik buterin , Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andersen, Roger Ver, Erik vorhees, mike Hearn and many others. 
Fortunately blockstream came along and unified the bitcoin community around one common sensible goal. I am forever indebted to them, Adam black, Peter Todd, Greg maxwell, Jameson loop, Luke jr, aantop, nick szabo, Samson mow. They are my heroes. They are our heroes. They sacrificied themselves for us. We should all feel forever indebted to them or otherwise Bitcoin would have been taken over by scammers. Life is not fair but this is one of those times where everything worked out perfectly. Now if only bcash would also go to 0, it would be much much better though. I’m just a bit scared because of the unending bcash pump and dump. But I trust our heroes and blockstream. Bitcoin (we) will win in the end!

When somebody asks you to explain why and your answer is to appeal to technical authority then you are doing their propaganda. The authority may be right but it’s irrelevant. 
What we must understand is appealing to authority is not an argument and any such behavior is essentially political propaganda.

I’m just pointing out the fact that your use of words suggest there are untrustworthy devs. This is political language.

Legally: You are most likely lying.
Philosophically: The reason for the $10,000 limit is to encourage travelers to use the banking system (approved by the government) to be able track the money.

I don't think he ever promoted "selling btc for bch". He is just promoting bch. Let's agree that these two are not the same thing. 
AFAIK the man has a libertarian dream. He invested his life into bitcoin because he believed bitcoin could help his dream become a reality. I think whatever dues he has for his gains from bitcoin, he already paid them. 
Passion makes religions grow from one to billions. Passion makes few people create empires. Passion made bitcoin what it is today. I have tremendous respect for the guy simply because of his passion. And that's why I think bch may succeed. The community has passion. Bitcoin community, on the other hand, lacks meaningful passion. The only passion I see is the passion for hodling.

@_date: 2017-09-20 16:12:40
I have been extensively reading and researching for only about a month now. My understanding is that the bitcoin cash is "bad" because it is a hard fork that had minority support in the beginning and hard forks should only occur when there is a majority consensus. Keeping bitcoin as it is is just the simple solution. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Right?
As I started learning about segwit (change block structure), segwit2x (increase block size) and lightning network (create channel hubs, scale off-chain), they just seem like complicated engineer solutions to a problem that can be solved very easily. Furthermore, none of them really address the problem of high fees in the long term. What's more, now 2X is opposed by so many in the community and a second fork is inevitable.
Finally, I have come to the understanding that if bitcoin is really going to become the digital gold but not an on-chain payment method then it is really in a bubble. I now agree with the idea that the value of bitcoin comes from its usability in purchasing a cup of coffee on chain without any intermediary. Hodling bitcoins doesn't add value to the network, spending bitcoins does.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:38:28
Asking people in the bitcoin cash subreddit that how much bch they bought with their btc does not make him a hypocrite. Can we agree on that?

This cannot be stressed enough, privacy. I think localbitcoins.com prices are better indicators of the value of bitcoin than the exchanges. There is no speculation, no pump and dump. It reflects the pure value of a bitcoin to a buyer or a seller.

What is your suggested route for liquidating all my paper wallets at once while paying minimum tx fees?
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:17:13
This is the best site to track fees: 
Fees are measured per byte. I think 70-80 sat/byte corresponds to a dollar or so **on average**. So any tx with less than $3 tx fee will likely be delayed for a long time.

@_date: 2017-09-30 21:47:22
English is not my first language but I think you want to say he is competing with BTC rather than attacking it. Competing with bitcoin doesn't make him a hypocrite nor a negative personality. Him wanting to store a part of his wealth in the coin that he is competing against only makes him cautious.
His arguments against the core bitcoin does not contradict the vision of core for bitcoin. He wants fast confirmation (no RBF) and low fees now (large blocks). I believe the current trend in the bitcoin community is small blocks and therefore RBF.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:59:37
Haha, yeah I own both. Obviously more bch than btc as it's cheaper. However, I am not angry at all. Any sane bitcoin investor is holding both coins at the moment. I suggest you the same even if you don't believe in the bch project. Its backers are solid.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:41:46
Bitcoin blocks are really full. Also, bitcoin cash is stealing hashrate from bitcoin. So while bitcoin cash blockchain is producing a block per minute (instead of the expected 10 minutes), bitcoin blockchain is producing a block every 15 minutes or so (instead of the expected 10 minutes) (
Sometimes it gets better. It was possible to pay zero fees for a while last month. But bitcoin tx fees will keep rising **on average**. You gotta get used to it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:59:04

Really? How long does it really take a transaction to reach a node on average? Mempool is full for so long, I am going to guess the miner node's mempool has enough high fee transactions to fill the block and not be able to include any tx with a fee less than 50 sat/byte. But these tx's get included frequently.
