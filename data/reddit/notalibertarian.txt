I was looking for some dignity, but then I realized you already took what was left of it with your wonderful and eloquent comment. Please, if you excuse me - I have a huge state cock to suck, that you seem to be so jealous about...

Don't feed me!

...now back to the numbers.

I'm still a huge fan of bitcoin. The only thing that really turns me off is this stupid libertarian attitude.
Regulation is not per se bad and sometimes a government is not only bad - though I understand that many from third world countries like the US, have a serious problem with governmental control. ;-)
Luckily, this will be off the table, once a major adoption has happened.

Funny, I am not american but this is exactly how I feel american libertarians see themselves.

Nice try, romanticizer. Still no arguments.
In the meantime just read the latest posts on MtGox if you're not entirely sure what I'm referring at.

I love how you actually put so much time into explaining, why this would not have happened on a free market. You almost changed my views.

Of course, now look at the numbers! Look back at me. Now, do you see that nice and hot Frappuccino in my Hand? Back to the numbers!
How much money did the government take? Now back to my Frappuccino? How much of these could Mark still have bought with the rest of the money he made with trading fees?
Back to the numbers and back to the Frappuccino. It's gone. So are your Gox Coins - but no worries, free market will sort this out for you!

Finally someone got it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:21:54
Look, I'm not the one saying that this can not or is not happening on regulated markets. While I remember a certain user in this thread thinking that, in a free market this wouldn't have happened.
Doesn't make me very optimistic about the state of your mind either.

I also like how you assume that I don't know what you are talking about. Men, I have probably read more books on austrian economics than Mark went to Starbucks last week.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:47:32
Thanks, I'm pretty proud of myself too!
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:08:28
You're right, bitcoin millionaires like will find me in fact amusing.

We all know and it also seems to be a standing opinion in this sub, that mismanagement and incompetence on MtGox side is the main reason for it's collapse.
Many libertarians believe that on a free market, people vote with their money and everything can be regulated by itself. In simple words: if somebody makes a bad decision with his business, he's out.
Well, MtGox showed us, that this is not the case. There were too many bad decisions made and greed was always stronger. Nobody left because everybody thought he was more clever than the rest and could make some fine bucks out of it.
Really, I love bitcoin but I think that this whole libertarian attitude is twirled shit in a sugar cone. It's pretty capitalistic, self centered, most times right winged opinions, covered in a charming dress. The problem is: you care only about yourself - just as much as the people do that you're so opposed to.

I don't actually want to go into this question, because it is too hypothetical: under what legal (japanese) jurisdiction would MtGox fall, if BTC was a currency and regulated as such?
But still, there would be many ways to prevent - and most of all - certain legal ways to handle this.
But let me predict the near future: some lawyers will nicely profit and those who've already lost are loosing more. MtGox leaving the scene. Applause.
What I just don't get is, why not more people here can see this? Many libertarians are too one-sided. They can only see black and white. If you speak against them, you'll be insulted or become the fool that defends the government. This is so ridiculous and I'm fed up reading this all over If you would, please be so kind to answer me one question:


What does this mean? And how can that help the free market survive?
On a note: hop over to Top posts are against gun control and minimum wage. What a proud moment this must be for a real libertarian.
On a note on the note: also, a pretty american "problem".
