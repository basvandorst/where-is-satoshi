Dont send too high amounts to you bank account but split. Remain always below approx. 10k. Depending on jurisdictions banks have to report to the tax authorities if a sum is received which exceed a certain threshold. Likewise in certain jurisdictions you cannot by a lambo with cash from an official distributor unless he reports it to the governmental authority.

Check the homepage of the Durch financial market authority. Most jurisdictions set exactly out if and what kind of licence you would require. Tax issues need to be reviewed separately.

10k is something you can easily earn after unhabe finished your studies. Do that and repay all the money and only invest own equity capital of about 25% and not more. Do not daytrade. Keep 75% of your funds in btc and ether — 90% thereof in btc and remaining 10% in ether. The remaining 25% put in 6-8 solid coins. Do not spend the entire 25% at once but divide it into 3 parts. Buy a ledger, transfer almost all funds to you ledger wallets. Read news what is going to happen. Look now and then at the charts. Hodl for at least 1 year and enjoy your life.

PnD are probably the biggest and poorest scam in crypto apart from ICO scams. It is also very bad to crypto as such. The easiest way not get caught by a PnD is simply not to follow any signals and stay away from shitcoins. There are great projects around in which it is worth to invest mid to longterm. Use your brain and remember that nowhere, also not in crypto, quick money is waiting for you.

It is quite easy. The value might be 100k or only 1€. But all of that is irrelevant since pragmatically it is only that worth what a third party buyer is willig to pay for it. And that is always the price.
