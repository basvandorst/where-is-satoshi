Can you post information on how to become involved with this? I lost 10BTC, not much, but for me, its the principle of being ripped off that I won't tolerate.

Fake link.

They are just ripping people off. Another fucking ponzi scheme.
I think Japanese law enforcement should pay them a visit and charge the entire team with criminal fraud and order them to repay all the coins.

Yeah, like anyone is going to trust this community. Fuck that.
That's like saying a building will survive an implosion and citing that the scrap metal in the junk yard is proof. 
Give me a fucking break.

My anger, along with the millions who were ripped off is entirely justified.

You tell your parents that you want to bring in law enforcement if they don't return the money asap.

What really sad is that I was so gung ho to promote, invest, inspire and integrate BTC into my business and help bring it mainstream. I have about 10 BTC in MtGox and I need that money and there is no reason at all why they can't contact members and manually process the withdrawls. I've experienced Bitstamp freezing their systems, I've had two failed attempts with wires from Bitstamp and now sadly, I'm done. Yes, free market will teach the hard lessons,  of course they will, but the free market will also decide to crush and destroy this community because it can't be trusted, which is at its core, what the BTC community is supposed to be about. 
I honestly thought that problem was going to be resolved by now and I think the CEO is going to try and rip people off. He will try, he will think he's a success when he buys his new home or cottage, then thanks to pissing off so many people in the dark web, I'm sure at some point we'll hear a story about how he was found dead. And what did we learn? Banks rip hard working people off, the Bitcoin community rips people off, people don't care and at least in the case of Mt.Gox, the CEO will have paid for it with his life, I would have lost my 10BTC and then if you think I'll ever in any way come back and support this community, you're the one whose delusional. So much for a million dollar bit coin hey?
If MtGox does not return whats mine, and what belongs to everyone, this community and all crypto currencies are dead. Why even think about investing into a non-regulated currency that has no means to hold people accountable other than vigilante justice?
I just want my fucking money back and with each passing day, the notion of helping advance this community falls victim to the notion of helping to destroy it since it can't be trusted.
So much for thinking that MtGox was trustworthy enough to at least do what they said they were going to do.

And you just proved my point about how unprofessional this community is and without professionalism, this will never hit main stream. Yeah I suppose the millions of people who used Gox are all idiots huh. Yeah, good luck buddy.
