There's no way to no the exact number, and I don't know of any estimate at the moment. I would assume the only ones switching to bech32 are people using Electrum right now.
With that said, I've sent from a bech32 address to Coinbase and other exchanges and it's worked fine, so I'm not sure if that wikipedia entry is just old or what.

On Coinbase, you have the option of transferring your Bitcoin over to it's exchagne, GDAX, for no fee. From GDAX, you can withdraw to any legacy bitcoin wallet (because they haven't implemented Segwit transactions yet) for free, because they will pay the miner fee on the transaction instead of you.
So basically, you're making them pay money, on purpose, to hurt them and show them why Segwit is important. It would honestly be funny, but probably against their TOS, to buy a Bitcoin and then transfer it out in extremely small parts so they pay a TON in miner fees.

Yes. I pre-filed for some of my gains in June and I'm about to file again for the rest of my realized gains (any that I sold, even if I bought back).

It should be noted that this isn't correct. With Segwit adoption and Schnorr Signatures, we'll be over 1 million per day. There are also other implementations that are coming to improve through-put even more.
More importantly though, you need to recognize that Lightning Network isn't the end of scaling. If anything, it's the beginning of layered scaling. It's Layer 2. We're going to have tons of layers and each one will increase the ability of Bitcoin.
So if we stopped at Lightning Network... sure, we'd never be able to scale to 7+ billion people. We're not stopping at Lightning, though.

A coin becomes more stable the more people hold it. Technically speaking, bitcoin is getting more stable every time there is a rush of new users... every time there is news about bitcoin... every time a new place starts to accept it.
In the short term, these things initiate a price rise, but what is actually happening is that the coin is getting more spaced out, and therefore reaching closer to it's eventual stable price.

How are you this dense? How is this even possible?
The US Dollar was no longer backed by gold after 1933, because you didn't have a right to demand it. The government would sell gold, but that isn't the same as dollars having it as a backing, because it couldn't be demanded.

Have you sent messages to the big players like Gemini and Coinbase and BlockchainAPI and such, telling them you want Segwit and asking for an update on when the will implement it?
Segwit takes a bit of work to implement, and companies handling millions of dollars are very careful when it comes to new updates that could risk that money... so yes, they are taking a while. the best thing to do is to remind them that you want Segwit and then move to a competitor that uses it (like BitStamp, who also use batched transactions which help a lot).
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:40:51
On the "Send" tab, do you have a fee setting bar like the one [seen here](
If so, it should be as easy as altering where that bar sits. A tooltip will tell you what it's set at in satoshis-per-byte, and when you hit send, the confirmation box will ask you if you're sure while telling you what your fee is set to in dollars.

Then you don't have to worry about private keys at all (you don't even control those private keys). Just know that you have an equal amount of BCH as what you had in BTC at the time of the fork. You can trade it for BTC if you want. It's like a free 15% boost in your BTC.

I really think you're stretching here... a currency is "backed" by a commodity only if you can demand that commodity in exchange at an equal rate when compared against what it was worth when you got it.
The government selling gold is entirely different from each individual person having the right to demand it. In 1933 the ability for a person to demand gold in exchange for their dollar ended. That is when the dollar stopped being backed by gold.

Until the top 4000 transactions (in terms of satoshi-per-byte fee settings) are clear, no one pays a fee of 30 sat/b... because those transactions don't get processed.


Same answer


If you think it's unimportant, maybe you don't understand where fees come from?


It seems you're the only one missing the point here. It the mempool becomes empty, fees can stay at 1 satoshi per byte. This is progress toward that goal.

A better way to say this is: your next transaction should be to a segwit address, but you don't have to do that right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:32:50
The way it works is not extremely obvious to most users. If you check [the mempool charts]( you can see that the transactions with the highest fees are prioritized and that is currently up in the 120 to 150 satoshi per byte range. Most transactions are about 250 byte.
So if you multiply the assumed size of your transaction (250) by the current high point on the mempool in terms of fees (150) and then you divide that by 100,000,000 since the original number is in Satoshis, you get the amount of BTC your fee should be at to go through quickly.
When you multiply that by the value of bitcoin: 


So average fee to get processed quickly right now is $5.44
That's nowhere near acceptable to most users, but you have to understand that so long as people are willing to pay that much, Bitcoin is technically "successful" at what it's doing. Segwit will help more transactions get through, which will mean there will be less competition in the mempool, and it might even clear. At that point, we can go back to negligible fees. That would really be nice. We haven't been there since October.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:35:40
Yes, Segwit + Schnorr + Batched would be an incredible increase in throughput.

30 satoshis **per byte**. Transactions are, on average, about 250 bytes. So it wouldn't be $0.004. It would be $1.000
Also, the chart is displaying that transactions are starting to clear at 50, not 30. So it's more like $1.66

In all seriousness, we're near parity this week.

Programs are still suggesting 300+ satoshis-per-byte as you can see from the top shards of color on those charts... but that isn't necessary. It's just a remnant of the backlog we had the last few months, which is almost entirely cleared as of today.

I've been thinking of developing a C++ or Python addition people could add to their game servers to help them implement Bitcoin as a premium currency in their game.
Basically, it would be a currency you could have alongside your normal credits in an online RPG, for example, and if people wanted to trade items for money, they could trade in the normal credits or in bitcoin... and it would do off-chain transactions while the server held the actual bitcoin and any players who wanted to could withdraw it.
So, for example, player 1 could deposit some bitcoin and offer it to other players for items to give themselves a boost if they are new, while player 2 could just be a long-term player and set up a shop with high-level items and only sell them for bitcoin.
Then the server runner could occasionally offer items for bitcoin to make extra money.
Essentially, it'd be a way to implement easy real money into their game without a major payment processor.

No one will be able to tell you for sure, but the fact that it matched the timing of segwit adoption jumping from 10 to 12% is probably not a coincidence. Segwit adoption is nearing 14% now so the trend will probably continue down through the 5 to 10 satoshi-per-byte range before people start transacting more because they realize they can do so with low fees.

My point is that you placed the blame for the recession on Andrew Jackson, when it was actually the banks which he fought against. He specifically warned against giving banks as much power as they had, because they could do something like that, and then they did just what he said they would.
His actions as president prevented the banks from having the power to do that again, until presidents after him gave the power back to them, allowing them to cause much larger problems, including (recently) one of the largest recessions the country has ever seen.

If the transaction page says 40.1s/b, that is the fee set on your transaction, no matter what you think you sent it at. It's possible whatever system you sent it through set the wrong amount, but regardless, it's at 40.1s/b.
If you [check the bitcoin mempool chart]( you can see that your fee setting puts you at around the 85,000 mark, with the queue going from the top, which is currently 140,000. That means there are literally 65,000 transactions with fees set higher than yours, and no sign in sight of those transactions getting cleared faster than new ones appear at a level higher than yours.
So your transaction likely won't clear. It's very possible you'll have to wait the two weeks, at which point the transaction and fee will be returned to your spendable balance.

has no idea what he's talking about. If you spend the BTC, save off the private key of the address, because it can be used to access the BCH that was generated at the time of the split on the BCash blockchain.
As long as you have that private key, and you don't give it to anyone, it'll still be on the BCash blockchain until you use it. It doesn't matter if you spend the BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.
The best thing for you to do is to move the BTC you have to a new address, save off the private key of the original account, use that private key to acquire your BCH on the BCash blockchain, transfer it to an exchange, trade it for more BTC, and store that in the new address .
The reason you move the BTC to a new address first is because you can't trust all of the BCH wallet apps, so you wouldn't want to put your private key in and then still have BTC in the corresponding wallet.

The US abandoned the gold standard in 1933, 85 years ago, which is almost a century.
Your confusion is most likely based around the fact that although the gold standard ended in 1933, there was still a connection of sorts between gold and US currency until 1971. That connection was not a direct correlated value though, so the money wasn't actually backed by gold then.

Absolutely nowhere in my comment did I say anything was simple. I have no idea where you got this meaning out of what I said.


Since it'll be the first coin to implement Lightning Network, which is already working on mainnet and now just waiting for more testing and implementations by developers... I honestly can't imagine how you can hold that opinion unless you have no idea what Lightning Network is.

Is the implication you're trying to make that fees will continuously and unstoppingly go up? Because they are down to $2 as of today and will probably drop even lower soon.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:41:14
Yes, which I view as an improvement to paying the extra amount all at once. We're not really talking about *avoiding* the fee, so much as not having this problem of paying it all at once.
Personally, I'm just going to hold off on transacting until the attention fades away from Bitcoin and the mempool clears. Segwit adoption would also get us there, but I think it'll happen before we get mass adoption of Segwit just from all the speculators holding or selling off and going away from Bitcoin for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:19:44
The size of a transaction depends on a lot of factors. The average transaction size from a legacy wallet is 255 bytes.
255  * 5 satoshis per byte is 1275 satoshis total.
1275 satoshis * 11500 (current price) / 100000000 (satoshis per bitcoin) = 0.146625
So we're currently at 15 cents a transaction, and still dropping.

This would be done *currently* through a wallet. Give it a year, and most users will be doing this with coins they don't have actual control over, through exchanges that recognize that the won't survive if they don't adapt to what their less educated users want.

Your patronizing tone is so unnecessary, especially considering you are dead wrong here. [Like I mentioned in another comment]( they actually do have an effect, it just isn't as pronounced as what we're seeing in the mempool and is therefore not the answer to the question of why the mempool is clearing so quickly.
With that said though, let me explain why you're wrong.
The difficulty algorithm changes itself up every so often, based on a desire to achieve an average block time of ten minutes. If the difficulty changes and then more hashing power is added than the algorithm expected, the average block time will be less than ten minutes until the next difficulty change.
So if a ton of hashing power was added because a new, more efficient miner was suddenly switched on, block time could decrease from ten minutes to eight minutes. Suddenly, ~4000 transactions are processing every 10 minutes instead of every 8. So the mempool clears faster.

Technically, yes. Once the attention from the 2017 price increase fades away and the speculators either sell or hold, transactions go down and we can clear the mempool, freeing up the conversation (which is currently dominated by fee issues) for things like Segwit adoption, Schnorr Signature status, Lightning Network testing, etc.

With the way the mempool has been going, it might be best to wait a few days. You mentioned in another comment you were right around 5 satoshis per byte... that layer is about to be clearing if the mempool continues it's pattern from this week. It could clear tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:28:51
Yep, and it's getting better every day. Technically we're not even at 5 satoshis per byte like we were this morning... we're at 3 now, which means transactions are actually at 9 cents, not 15. The mempool might clear this week, meaning we'll go to 1 satoshi per byte... so 3 cents per transaction.
Hopefully segwit adoption and lightning usage will rise, as well as batched transactions... so that the next time there's a huge media frenzy around bitcoin, we'll be more prepared and not end up with a large mempool backlog like we did these last few months.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:17:22

The question is how often they'll need to interact with the chain, and in what way? If exchanges were all using batch processing and most users went through exchanges (as they currently do, and will most likely continue to do) then even opening and closing of lightning channels would be done through batches. Once lightning is implemented on exchanges, individual users probably won't even be opening their own channels... they'll be utilizing a constantly open channel through the exchange.
Every new layer will work like that, with the technology propagating to make on-chain transactions less common as the older tech reaches a point where it fills up the blockchain.

I could just as easily say PoS is solar energy and make as much sense. It's like saying something is the citizen kane of X... it requires a proper explanation, and none is given.
PoS has a proven track record of keeping coins safe from attacks, just like PoW does. The writer wants to portray PoS as some sort of unproven snake-oil because he doesn't have the knowledge to properly compare his favorite coin against others.
The argument boils down to "Incredible Security comes only from an incredible amount of work" and that is terrible and demonstrably false logic when it comes to all cryptos, including Bitcoin. There is a high probability that Bitcoin will eventually, in the next thirty years, move away from PoW. It will be a discussion that needs to be had when the false doctrine of "Bitcoin will always have the highest hash rate" falls away.

Ripple is unmineable, meaning that at the time of it's creation, one entity controlled all of it and sells it to users. Those users up the price the more of them there are, so the original creator makes billions of dollars from doing nothing. A lot of people find this to be a generally unfair system and against the spirit of cryptocurrency. Also, since it isn't able to be mined by users, only the controlling entity mines it, meaning that it can all fall apart if they decide to just stop one day because they've made enough money and have no real responsibility to their users.
Ethereum isn't pre-mined or unable to be mined, but it has a specific problem in that it won't scale correctly over the coming years. It handles more transactions than Bitcoin because it's block size is larger (more room to stuff transactions into during the mining process) but that means that the collection of those blocks will get way larger way faster than Bitcoin's... which means that the cost of storing the entire chain of transactions will rise until it is no longer accessible for the average user to run their own node (nodes protect the network from hacking, help transactions get passed and processed, and require the entire chain of transactions to be up to date on the machine in order to run).
Bitcoin's solution to that scaling issue is implementing Segwit (smaller transaction strings instead of just raising the amount of space they get stuffed into) and the ability to handle transactions instantly and off-chain (so they don't add space to the blockchain) using the Lightning Network, which is a tech that has just been released and isn't widely available yet, but will be soon.

You are mistaken. The mempool doesn't fill from either side. It has a large bottom because people are attempting to put in transactions with extremely low fees, hoping the mempool clears (or perhaps they are ignorant to the fact that it would have to empty to process those transactions)
If you start taking away the 1 to 10 satoshi per byte transactions, it won't slow down the amount of transactions being added to the pool, and you won't be processing those transactions any faster than the miners aiming for the top would otherwise be processing the ones at the top.
All you'll be doing is increasing the average fee by eliminating from the bottom instead of the top.

They are only tangentially related to mimblewimble, as MW uses them. They are exactly what they sound like... instead of transactions all going out at once, an entity saves up transactions that are supposed to occur and sends them all at once in a single transaction. The transaction is large, but much smaller than the sum of all of the transactions if they were sent on their own.
If exchanges like Coinbase used these, it would up our transaction volume so much in one day, it would make your head spin. Gemini could also stand to implement them. BitStamp already does (on top of also having Segwit implemented!)

If a large company runs a channel hub, they have to compete with all other channel hubs, and each one is racing to the bottom with their prices. Since lightning channel payments will search for the fastest and cheapest route, if a company isn't working in our best interest and charging a very low fee, it wont get your business when you go to pay.
That is to say, yes I think companies may try to form hubs, but there is no reason to think they will gain a foothold and become the only hubs in an area, or be able to price gouge.

First off, [filter it down to 24 hours instead of 3 months so you can see the current state]( You could even try [2 hours]( Then, look at the colors going from bottom to top. There is a key legend in the top left of the chart showing what each color, in order from bottom to top, represents.
Dark Blue (1 to 2), Teal (2 to 5), Red (5 to 10), Purple (10 to 20), and Lime (20 to 30) are untouched for the last few weeks.
Light Blue (30 to 50) is just barely getting dug into at it's very top, and Yellow (50 to 70) is almost entirely gone. That means that transactions right at the bottom of yellow have a good chance of being processed, though I would recommend something like 55 or so, as the yellow bar has started to re-appear which means there are some transactions above 50 that would be prioritized above a 50-satoshis-per-byte transaction now.

I may be using the term incorrectly, but I just consider it "dust" when you have a lot of unspents instead of having them consolidated. If someone had 100 unspents of 0.1 BTC each, I'd still consider it dust because when they went to spend 1.0 BTC, it would have to consolidate 10 of them.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:37:37
If you need to use your Bitcoin now, you might be screwed. Fees are down below 70 satoshis per byte, but that's still going to sting consolidating those.
If you can wait though... just wait. The mempool might clear or at least get better and you could save yourself a huge amount of money. If it clears entirely, you could set your next transaction to a consolidation transaction and pay 1 satoshi per byte. Pennies.

Not exactly... the network is full of systems that predict no need to raise fees because they always expect to get into a block. What happens when transactions start taking days to get processed because that expectation is proven wrong?

Yes, what he means is that the higher the amount you're spending, the more likely your payment will have to go through a bigger channel, which might have a slightly higher (yet still negligible) fee.

With Lightning Network, every person involved has to have an online program running, to accept or to send... so no, that really wouldn't make sense. Who would want a tip-bot that relied on the person you were tipping to have their program running to receive the tip? Who would even want to use a tip-bot that required you to run a program at all? It's added complexity where it is unneeded.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:09:18
No you're misunderstanding me. Let's say I tip you through this theoretical LN tip bot, but you aren't online. At what point to you actually receive the tip? The bot holds on to it and then gives it to you... when?
The next time you have activity on reddit? It still won't know if you have your lightning wallet on.
The next time your wallet goes on? How will it know? Is there a notification system built into LN yet?
The next time you try to tip? This works only until you realize some people don't want to tip, and would just like to get their money out... so you've added a polling requirement.
When you specifically ask for it? That's a big complication for something as simple as a tip bot... Imagine if anyone who had tips on in [TipBit]( had to poll it to get their money before tipping it around...
Tip bots are supposed to be simple. In fact, any tech that is going to be used widely should be simple. I just don't see how a LN tip bot would overcome these issues. It's solving a non-problem with a bigger real problem.

There are two distinct possibilities:
* The transaction volume is lowering, meaning that the excitement over it by the non-educated, just-trying-to-get-rich-quick crowd is fading away... meaning the trend will continue until the mempool is cleared and fees go away.
* The (alleged) attack of false spam transactions is disappearing, so real transactions are all that's left and they are getting processed instead of falling behind the spam transactions.
Either way, it's **great news** because Bitcoin (as both a system and a community) can stop being concerned with fees for a short time while Segwit adoption increases, Schnorr Signatures are worked on, Lightning Network is tested, etc... We get a reprieve from the biggest problem facing Bitcoin and we use it to improve the system so that the problem doesn't happen next time the public goes crazy for crypto.

Tech-wise, bech32 is the best, but there is not a lot of support for it just yet. For example, you can't withdraw from a lot of services (like coinbase) from a bech32 address. You can still send transactions from the bech32 to anyone, but receiving is spotty because a lot of places haven't implemented the tech yet.
If you aren't going to be receiving from a bunch of services, and your account is more for sending, bech32 is the way to go.

This doesn't help anything... you won't get through more transactions than the other pools... you'll just be processing the cheaper transactions instead of the expensive ones.

I would assume they pass the majority of the miner fees on to their primary user base at the moment, which is speculative investors that don't know to use GDAX to avoid fees.
That's why buying Bitcoin on Coinbase has such high fees in general, actually. They are offsetting the fees they are eating on GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:20:27
No, I understand everything you're saying... but you're not getting what I'm saying. I understand that you could process the lower fee transactions instead of the higher fee transactions, but the mempool wouldn't clear any faster.
Let's say there are 12,000 transactions sitting in the mempool:
* 3000 transactions at 1 satoshi per byte
* 3000 transactions at 5 satoshis per byte
* 3000 transactions at 10 satoshis per byte
* 3000 transactions at 20 satoshis per byte
Then let's say that every ten minutes, a block is processed, 4000 transactions with it, and let's also say 4000 (or more) new transactions get added to the mempool (since the current problem is that the mempool isn't clearing for this exact reason)
**In the ordinary mining procedure, they take from the top.**
 So they'd remove 3000 transactions at 20s/b and 1000 at 10s/b. Then because people are competing for processing, the same 1000 10s/b and 3000 20s/b transactions get added... so the mempool at the time of the next block is in the same exact state.
**Now let's show what happens with your method, processing from the bottom**
You'd remove 3000 transactions at 1s/b and 1000 at 5s/b. Then because people are competing for processing and the top transactions are at 20s/b, 4000 20s/b transactions join the mempool (at the absolute best case scenario, with the fee not rising to compete even more). Now the mempool looks like this:
* 2000 transactions at 5 satoshis per byte
* 3000 transactions at 10 satoshis per byte
* 7000 transactions at 20 satoshis per byte
You see that there is still 12,000 transactions, right? The only thing you've done is **raised the average transaction fee**

In the grand scheme, yes absolutely. The Bitcoin blockchain, after eight years, is only around 150GB. We could stand to double all future additions with the rate at which harddrive capacity becomes cheaper over time, without alienating almost any nodes.


Long-term, we are absolutely going to have to increase block-size. This is something all of the core devs agree on, they are only debating when and how to do so. Since it is clear we will eventually have to settle on something at least 2x, we should move to 2x now to make Bitcoin usable and then we can continue the debate without having to rush it due to major, reasonable concerns over the usefulness of a currency that can't send transactions for less than a $25 fee.
If you can break that down and still think my argument is "durr make blox bigger", this discussion can't really continue... I need someone who can actually think critically.


I absolutely would agree that the major players dragged their feet too long, and now they are being extra careful (which I appreciate with how important it is for them to get it right) and are far behind where they should be on the implementation of Segwit.
But since all of core devs agree we'll need a blocksize increase of at least 2x at some point in the future, and because the code change for that increase would be about 2 lines of code (unlike Segwit) and could be done overnight (unlike Segwit), now is a **very** good time to add it.
CoinBase and Gemini would have no excuse to implement it quickly, we could clear the mempool and make Bitcoin usable again, and then we could have the debate about future scaling solutions at our leisure.
If you can't understand this, I can't help you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:40:00

The issue with $20 a month is that there is a fee to purchase through the main outlets (CoinBase/GDAX or ATMS) that would make small purchases a bit of a problem.

New locations open up every day if you pay attention on the sub, but most of them are not huge companies that would be worth naming here. With that said, we're not ready for those huge companies. If Amazon started accepting Bitcoin tomorrow, the mempool would be demolished and we'd be playing catch-up more than we already are due to just the influx of "investor" users.
Instead of focusing on that, a lot of the work has been focusing on the technological improvements that will lead us to be ready. That's why we got Segwit on August 1st. That's why we're trying to get full Segwit adoption by large players like Coinbase. That's why the dev team is working on Schorr signatures. That's why Lightning Network is being developed. A lot of the recent value surge is most likely because of these technological improvements and the fact that they mean our ability to scale to mass adoption is getting closer.
Bitcoin is scaling to become ready for large companies to start using it. It's poised to become the first crypto that is really able to be scaled for mass adoption, but it takes a while to get there. Until then, don't expect (and certainly don't demand) that list to expand, because we *just aren't ready yet*.

I don't fully understand the exact need for all of the transaction history. If we could create a fork that just shared that blockchain state and built from there, and every year we built a new one and shared that one around.... I feel like we'd save on space while at the same time be able to expand block size.
But like I said, I don't know exactly what the history is useful for other than for transparency of the blockchain. It might be needed and I just might not understand.

Off-chain solutions require on-chain transactions, like Lightning Network opening and closing channels, and will only cause more problems if we don't clear the mempool prior by recognizing that a fix of a 2x block size increase is simple to add and won't cause centralization to anywhere near an extent that it'd be worth worrying about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:41
The amount of added transactions is entirely theoretical and at the very least, fees would be reduced significantly because the mempool would clear for a bit. Also, it'd be one less thing to worry about before we get Schnorr Sigs and LN, so let's not shit on it. We should encourage Coinbase and Gemini to enable Segwit support.
My personal view is that we also should push for a 2x blocksize increase on top of this.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:02
I'm all-in on Bitcoin, and I've been HODLing for a long time, and I'm legitimately worried. I'm not FUDing for another coin... I'm worried for BTC.
Fees are out of control (around $25, and on top of that, people unaware of the fee system are using "recommended" fees which are even higher than that (~$125). Even the basic fees are out of control and bitcoin's network is in a **very, very bad place**.
Denying that is foolish, and will only hurt Bitcoin in the long run. We need an open dialogue with core devs on a blocksize increase **on top of the existing Segwit** because we can't just rely on Coinbase updating to Segwit sometime soon, and even if they did, it wouldn't be enough if we get more mainstream adoption from a big run-up in the future.
For the sake of Bitcoin, you should be worried about these problems instead of denying them. I would agree that there is definitely FUD and shills in this sub coming from but some of the things they are saying are right, and we should be worried about Bitcoin's future regardless of whether the source of those comments is a clear enemy.
We also can't just rely on Lightning Network, [especially when it comes with it's own problems with regard to the mempool]( and we have no idea how quickly people will even adapt to it on mainnet. I say this even though I am very hopeful for Lightning Network in the long run... we need to worry about the short-term right now because we're in dire straights
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:30:16

A blocksize increase of 2x could clear the mempool within 24 hours. there are currently 175000 transactions pending. The current rate of removal is around 7 per second as per the current blocksize's allowance.
So with 7 extra transactions per second, we could clear (7 * 60 * 60 * 24) in a day, which is 604800
Even if you took a conservative estimate and said we do 3 transactions per second, that would still be 259200
If you understand this, [as your other comment implies]( why are you continuing to spread this misinformation? With an empty mempool, there would be no competition for getting into the blockchain so there would be virtually no fees at all.

The core devs have specifically stated that they recognize the need for a blocksize increase, and it is just the *how* and *when* they are debating on, so you are demonstrably wrong here, on top of being wrong because you're implying blockstream is somehow in charge of bitcoin development when in actuality very few of the primary developers are connected to Blockstream.

Yeah... it helps to remember that the market cap doesn't belong to them and it being high isn't their goal. They want Bitcoin to change the world... they want it accessible to all people for the far future, and they're making their decisions based on that goal.
So even though I advocate for 2x blocksize increase on top of Segwit + LN, I totally respect and understand that they don't want that at this time. I just like keeping the dialogue open, because maybe one day they'll see that perhaps the 2x blocksize is do-able while still maintaining their goals.

It's possible that it's just a mistake but it is also possible that a bad actor in the space purposely stuffed only one transaction in to add to the congestion on the network.

Core needs to implement Segwit in to the UI as well, and there's just no timeline on that right now.

I'm really glad you understand the issue.


That's the hope, but I just worry that the pressure would be so much that people might be waiting days just to open a channel. Lightning Network is our chance to really achieve mass adoption and I want to avoid scaring away a large number of new-comers with a huge wait just to get involved with it...
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:23:47
I really don't think you understand the problem. Could you maybe read my post again and actually follow it this time?
Imagine this order of events:
* Lightning Network moves to mainnet. The bitcoin community is happy and maybe 50% of users are, within a month, using LN exclusively. They occasionally have to open and close channels which requires an on-chain transaction, but they are happy with the thousands more transactions done off-chain with no problem. **So far, so good.**
* With the success of lightning network, businesses start signing on. With the added channel openings and closings, the on-chain network has a bit more to handle but still the mempool is empty because of the off-set of so many of the on-chain transactions. **So far, so good.**
* With businesses signing on, existing bitcoin users that have been waiting to use LN (and just HODLing because they couldn't use their coins) start opening and closing channels. We're getting close to filling blocks again because of all of the added traffic, but the mempool is still clear. **So far, so good.**
* Suddenly, there is news on Bitcoin. Because of all the new liquidity, the price rises. People are buying more and more because the media makes it seem like a get-rich quick scheme, so businesses do what businesses do: **They recognize that with so many people jumping into bitcoin, now is the time to advertise that they accept bitcoin through LN and offer discounts, so EVERYONE STARTS OPENING AND CLOSING CHANNELS**. The mempool starts filling up again, and before you know it, people have to pay $40 just to open a channel.
This can be avoided if we raise the blocksize by 2x now, and prepare to raise it to 2x or more again later when we get a feel for how large the lightning network will really be, and how often people will be opening and closing channels on it.
Ask yourself if we'd really be prepared for mass public adoption with all of the opening and closing of channels with Segwit and LN... we wouldn't... it should be clear to anyone that has researched LN. We need to roll out a plan to increase blocksize NOW and get it ready for mass adoption, because now more than ever, it's coming soon.

If you look at my history, especially today, you'll see I'm a huge proponent of a blocksize increase *on top of Segwit*.
With that said, you are completely wrong to say that Segwit adoption won't fix fees, at least at the current level of Bitcoin transactions. Segwit halves the size of transactions, so if it were actually implemented by Coinbase and all of the other major players, it would clear the mempool within 24 hours.

It's a rich man's game these days, and I'm excited for when it opens back up with Segwit and LN but it will still have a ways to go before we reach VISA levels.
Fortunately, we're nowhere near the level where we should even be expecting VISA levels of traffic, so Segwit + LN might be enough to clear the mempool for a long time and let us talk about future innovations at our leisure instead of this mad rush we're in now.

This is such a ridiculous argument that you're just parroting from someone else who also didn't know what they were talking about.
Yes, the Bitcoin network will always be under attack, but it must improve to be able to handle those attacks. If it can't handle attacks at this level, what do you think will happen during mass adoption? You think we shouldn't even be attempting to make it more difficult to enact a meaningful attack by increasing the blocksize?
If LN is enacted, you're basically saying it won't matter because the attackers will just double their effort to replace all of the transactions that go off-chain. While that is possible, we should absolutely be aiming to prevent this or at least make it as difficult as we can, within reason. A 2x increase is well within reason.

I've seen this question posed before, although usually it's not a question it's an accusation. "If we make Bitcoin throughput better, people will just use it more and fill the mempool all over" is partially possible, though I don't think it's any reason not to push forward and make the throughput better.
The community is, hopefully, learning that bitcoin, while unfragile, has a network that is very fragile in it's usefulness. LN will solve a lot of these issues if it goes as well as people are imagining, but Segwit is the first step, and we need to be pushing for it now to at least temporarily alleviate the problem.
The last time the mempool was clear was October. Think about that... we've been dealing with this issue for two months now, and every bit of focus on it takes away focus from future implementations past Segwit. Let's get Segwit adoption, so we can stop worrying about it and continue scaling through solutions like LN. Eventually, we'll have enough throughput that we can stop worrying. It might be ten features past LN, but we'll get there.

If they have the system working on testnet, doing seamless transactions with next to no fees, instantly... why would you even think it can't be moved to mainnet within a year? Are you unaware that the transition of a working system from testnet to mainnet is about two lines of code change? At this point they're just making sure all the testing continues to go well before they move it over. I wouldn't be surprised if we see it on mainnet before the end of February at the latest.
It'll still be a while from that point to a point where it's commonly used and has proper tools for it, but at least we can start moving transactions off-chain and people can start developing UX for the future of it.

For the average every-day user that is still transacting with high fees, sure.
What about the people who currently aren't doing any transactions because they are prohibitively expensive? They'll start opening and closing channels.
What about the people who are currently staying away from Bitcoin specifically but will join up when Lightning Network is in the news? They'll add to the transactions
What about the people that aren't interested in crypto but will become interested when they see simple, instant, fee-less transactions accepted at online or brick-and-mortar stores because of Lightning Network? They'll flood us in comparison to our current traffic.
We need to be prepared for the future, and we currently aren't even prepared for the present (or even the past, technically). A small blocksize increase on top of Segwit would really help to eliminate the risk and make Bitcoin usable again *prior to Lightning Network becoming fully adopted* which is what we really should be striving for. The last thing we need when Lightning Network is finally out is for it to cost $40 to open up your first channel.

I do use Segwit, exclusively. Guess what happens when I make a Segwit transaction to another Segwit address? I still have to get my transaction confirmed... which means it has to compete by way of a satoshi-per-byte fee... so yeah, I have less bytes to pay for because of Segwit, but I'm still paying a ridiculous amount per byte, and it's still enough bytes to be a ridiculous amount overall.
I'm not sure if you really understand the full extent of the problem, to be honest... and I don't mean that in a rude way... it just seems like you don't realize where fee increases come from. They aren't inherent to the system... they are a direct result of the mempool being full because people then have to compete to get their transactions processed by miners, which means they increase their fees so miners will prioritize them over others. **If the mempool is empty, fees are non-existent, or at the most 1 or 2 satoshis-per-byte, instead of 500 which is where we are now.**
Segwit can't clear the mempool until the big players implement it, while an immediate block size 2x change would clear it overnight. Clearing the mempool would eliminate that problem and also free up the conversation about getting Coinbase and other major players to implement Segwit, because we would no longer be on a time limit. Eventually, after Segwit we'll still need a blocksize increase, so we should just do it now and get it over with

The colored sections represent ranges of satoshis-per-byte of the currently waiting transaction pool.
So if the dark blue color at the bottom represents 1 to 2 satoshis per byte, and represents one third of the height of the chart at the current moment, then one third of all transactions waiting to be confirmed are set at between 1 and 2 satoshis per byte.
An extremely large portion of the chart height at the current time is made up of the first three colors over 0 satoshis per byte... they represent, collectively, the transactions between 1 and 10 satoshis per byte. The last bit is all of the transactions set to a higher fee per byte than that, and it's a very small section because those get cleared immediately while the ones under 10 (specifically 8 or lower, most likely) tend to not get cleared quickly...
So if you'd put in a transaction at 10 sats/byte, you'd be in the top portion of that third color, red... which means your transactions would clear pretty quick.

This is the exact definition of a slippery slope argument... the implication that if we do it once, we have to continue doing it at higher amounts. Instead, he should recognize that Segwit and the lowering of transaction sizes in general will not be enough, and that at the very least we should recognize that a 2x increase now will put us closer to what will eventually need to be at. He's implying that a blocksize increase necessitates continuing to do so as if it would necessarily mean throwing out other solutions like Segwit or Schorr Signatures or Lightning Network.
The argument for a 2x increase is the logical middle ground: That although Segwit and Schorr Signatures and Lightning Network will do a lot, it will also need a small increase on top of that to function properly with all of the increased traffic it will most likely cause. We don't have to commit to blocksize increases being the way we'll handle the situation next time, we just need to recognize that where we currently are, at 1MB (or ~2.7 with Segwit) will most likely never be enough if we want to be utilized at a world wide scale, even if almost everyone is using off-chain solutions, since they require on-chain transactions like when LN opens or closes a channel.

Blockstream is not in charge of Bitcoin, regardless of what thinks. The few bitcoin developers that are connected to Blockstream are not even close to the majority, so please stop with the implication that Blockstream has to propose anything in this case. That's a narrative from and is very clearly untrue once you look into it.
As far as the question, I think the core devs should be introducing a fork soon, potentially before mid-January, and rolling it out over the course of (at max) 24 months, recognizing that within that time we are going to expand to a point where Segwit, even at full adoption and with LN on top of it, won't be enough to offset the number of people transacting on the blockchain.
I don't think there's ever a "too late" if you're only concerned about Bitcoin surviving, but I'm concerned about Bitcoin falling from the top spot... I'm concerned about another coin (which also can't handle the traffic we're facing) getting the top spot and then when it has the same issues, I'm concerned with people becoming disillusioned with crypto because they just expect this problem from all coins, when instead Bitcoin could solve this problem within two years and scale to mass adoption... but only if we act now.
We could change the world for the better, but we have to act.

I've heard of this theory, that miners are prioritizing their own spam transactions, but never seen any actual evidence behind it. [The spread on the actual mempool doesn't support the theory at all]( so I have reason to believe the theory is just another attack on Bitcoin. AKA, you're being convinced by someone who hates Bitcoin that the problems aren't real or won't be solved by the obvious fix, because that lie will cause you to fight against the fix.

@_date: 2017-12-31 07:12:03
We really need a subreddit specifically for the answers to questions like this... but here we go:
Bitcoin transactions have to get confirmed by miners and passed around by nodes. The nodes have to have a complete copy of the blockchain on their computer to do this, and the blockchain is a record of every transaction that has ever occurred on the chain. Every ten minutes, a new block is formed and gets added to that chain. Currently, legacy would add up to 1MB and Segwit would add up to ~2.7MB.
Let's just assume Legacy for now, and 1MB getting added to the blockchain every ten minutes. That's 1MB * 6 * 24 * 365 every year, which is 52.560 Gigabytes of data.
If you upped the blocksize to (using BCash's method as an example) 8MB, the amount could become 8 times that... so 420.480 Gigabytes per year. That means in five years, the blockchain will increase by 2.1 Terabytes of space, and every miner and every node will need to have the storage space to hold the blockchain.
The core dev team are attempting to avoid this, because it means that the only miners and nodes will be people who can afford the extra storage. They want people with less money to still be able to run nodes, because that means more nodes, and less chance that node ownership will be taken over by companies instead of individuals. If companies held the majority of nodes, the government could push on them a lot easier than they could push on a huge group of individuals... and bitcoin is specifically aiming to be free from government interference... so we want the decentralization that comes with a smaller blockchain.
On top of this, even if core devs wanted a block size increase, it would have to come from a hard-fork of the code. Hard-forks require consensus and could split the community (just like the last hard-fork did... forming us and BCash's community). That's not good for Bitcoin.
Because of this, core devs are pushing for off-chain, second-layer transaction to take on the bulk of the work, and they want a lot of it to be done with soft-forks which won't split the community. Segwit is a small block size increase, but serves mainly to allow second-layer additions. Schnorr signatures is a simple soft-fork upgrade to allow even more transaction through-put. Lightning Network is a huge second-layer solution that will offset tons of transaction to be off-chain so the main blockchain can be cleared... These are long-term solutions, while a blocksize increase is a short-term solution that will just cause the problems described down the line.

In the same sense, your previous comment was good up until the beginning, when you implied that anyone recommending a block size increase is automatically a FUDster...


It would alienate some nodes, absolutely, but not anywhere near to the extent that people are implying. The overwhelming majority of nodes could handle a 2x increase for the next few years without an issue. In the immediate, we'd pretty much just be eliminating some of the Raspberry Pi nodes.


The current solution requires a complicated code change, which is why CoinBase and Gemini and other exchanges are dragging their feet to implement it. As a developer, I know how careful they have to be when making that big of a change.
A basic blocksize increase, however, is about two lines of code, and represents no risk to their company. They could implement it overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:09:04

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:17:05
If the only reason any node would need the full state is so that others could sync to them... then the only reason to sync to the full state would be to allow others to... I don't think you're understanding my question.
Why would someone need the full state if we'd forked in a way that allowed us to use the state "as of January 1st". For example, if every February 1st we re-forked after compiling the state up to January 1st. If we could all agree on the compilation by way of node / miner consensus, we could use the smaller compilation file that just contained balances and not the transactions that led up to them. We could essentially erase tons of transaction data but still have the proper result of that data.
It would save us a lot of space on the blockchain. Every year we would prune off all of the transaction data and just keep the balances. If someone wanted to store off the original blockchain with every transaction, I'm sure some people would keep it somewhere, but it wouldn't be used for Bitcoin itself anymore...

Are you not aware that the devs have stated they are planning a blocksize increase, it's just the *when* and *how* that they are not sure on? I'm not asking for something Bitcoin isn't going to have... I'm just arguing that we need a solution sooner rather than later.
Segwit won't be enough to save us. Core knows this, but they don't seem to realize the fix needs to come now, or at least soon.
If you're convinced that anyone who wants a blocksize increase is a FUDster, you should really just shut up while the adults are talking.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:13
Having people who are only holding switch over to a Segwit wallet just creates unnecessary transactions. They can switch over after mempool clears.
Could you include a note on the next post:
**If you aren't using Bitcoin for transactions right now, and you're just HODLing, there's no reason to switch to Segwit right now. Just know that your NEXT transaction should be to move to a Segwit wallet.**
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:22:58
As an addendum to this, the hope is that eventually, it won't cost $10 to open or close a channel, because so many transactions will be off-chain instead of on-chain, and with full segwit adoption the mempool might stay close to empty for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:54:32
In our daily posts, could we potentially have some data about the current timeline for getting Segwit into Bitcoin Core GUI? I am totally on the side of the dev team as far as it needing to be a slow process to make sure everything is done correctly, but I think the community could really benefit from having an estimated timeline so that we have less to worry about.
Bitcoin Core getting Segwit in the GUI is a good step on the way to the major exchanges getting it, as it would provide pressure on them and set a precedent for the average user.

There actually is, in the sense that the increase can be small (2x now) with a more permanent solution (4x?) coming later once technology improves, we get a feel for how centralization will be affected by the 2x increase,  and we see the effect of Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:10:44
Okay, well then a blocksize increase might be a possible solution... maybe even a temporary one.
I don't know how *stuck* the community is on the idea of transparency of transactions. I prefer the way Ethereum (if I'm not mistaken) keeps an updated status of the chain instead of needing the entirety of the history, so it's full nodes really only need the updated chain status and not the entire history of every transaction. I don't know if that's something the bitcoin community would go for, but it would help to solve the issue of larger block sizes hurting decentralization. Sadly I don't see a lot of serious talk about that here.
If we had that, we would have a much easier decision when it came to the *when* and *how* of a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:54:41
They say 133MB blocks would be needed **to have 7 billion people using it**. There's a huge difference. Stop spreading misinformation and FUD.

Like I already said, they started late... and to expand on that, we should absolutely give them shit for starting late, but we shouldn't assume they'll take another year now that they've finally started.


I suppose I can agree there, though I think the fact that it takes 24 months before it activates is a very, very good reason to start it now... If we don't at least start moving to 2x, we're going to have a problem in two years, even with Segwit full adoption. We can't possibly handle mass adoption by the public, even with Lightning Network, if Bitcoin transactions actually become popular in stores and in every-day life.
If we need to move now to be ready in two years, we should be moving now and at least preparing the minimum we're going to need, which I think 2x (on top of Segwit) represents.

I'm not expecting a crash, though I am prepared for one if it comes. IMO, CBOE was a good hint toward the truth... that people shorting are just going to lose money and end up liquidating their positions... and that those shorts don't have a major effect on the price at all, especially given how limited they are by the fact that for every short, someone has to buy long.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:22:41
While that is true, you must understand that over the long term you will experience drops, and this amazing rise has a chance of being partially a bubble that will drop your $100 investment to a value of $70 or lower.
Aim high, and believe that Bitcoin will rise over-all when you HODL for long times, but don't start thinking it's an alternative to your job just yet.

If your fee was 0.00008 btc, that's $1.424, which is about 9000 satoshis, which is about 35 satoshis per byte.
If your transaction has a fee set of less than 250 satoshis per byte, it probably will get cancelled and sent back to whatever wallet you sent it from. Like I said, the network is essentially broken right now. Hold your coins in whatever wallet they started in once the transaction cancels itself out, and keep fighting for a real fix for this issue by demanding a dialogue from core devs or demanding Segwit adoption from Coinbase.

I know that it's currently broken. Too many new users jumped in because of the price increase specifically caused by news of the technological improvements on the way which are meant to help avoid the problem those new users caused... ironic in a way, but also exactly what you should expect to happen if you understand how Bitcoin works.
Bitcoin moves slow, and things have to be planned ahead, and there are some issues you can't really avoid without taking huge risks, which is not something the bitcoin devs want to do, and we should appreciate that. With that said, I understand that it is frustrating to use it at the moment, which is why many people are referring to it as a store of value instead of a currency until Lightning Network is live and used by major players. You might be best off holding your coins until then.
The good news is that we're very close to a solution that will free us from this problem for the foreseeable future, and put Bitcoin far ahead of every competitor in terms of usability. So hold out, and enjoy the ride.

Very specific use cases? Lightning Network, if it has a large enough user base, could literally offset hundreds of thousands of bitcoin transactions a day and allow it to be used in stores and online shops with ease and no worry about network congestion [other than one specific issue I see, which could be solved by either full Segwit adoption or a blocksize increase](

Not me. I'm expecting us to hover between 13 and 17 for a while before another small run-up when we get our next Segwit milestone (another major exchange implementing it, or Bitcoin Core GUI).
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:16
[The bitcoin mempool is swamped at the moment]( because of a huge run-up in the number of users, and therefore transactions.
The network can only handle about 3 to 7 transactions per second, and double that if we fully utilize Segwit, but big players like CoinBase (which represent a huge percentage of transactions) haven't applied it yet, so we're stuck with small blocks.
The core devs don't have an open dialogue about when and how a block size increase can come, and we need it sooner than later because with the back-log of transactions and the competition to get your transaction processed leading to a bidding war on transaction fees, fees have risen exponentially to around $25 and even higher (~$125) when less-informed users use "recommended fees" on places like Coinbase or even ledgers...

Technically speaking, if Bitcoin were to ever go up to 1 million, the devs could implement a change to allow for a specification of satoshis paid for the entire transaction instead of doing satoshis-per-byte. In fact, we should really be heading in that direction now so as to avoid the problem in the future.
It would require a hard fork, so it should be saved for when one is already necessary, obviously.

This is a map of the location of lightning network nodes and their connections to each other.
The larger and more inter-connected this network gets, the more people are running lightning nodes which help people to test the network and eventually get it ready for use on the main bitcoin blockchain (it's currently being used on a technically identical chain called testnet).
Once it's on mainnet (the main chain we use for actually transactions), transactions will be able to be made on it near-instantly and nearly free of fees.

Credit cards started out more complicated than paper money, and honestly are still more complicated than paper money. The stores had to pull out a big clunky machine to run a paper through with the card, and then send it off to a bank to confirm it. Now the cards have to be inserted or swiped (it's still unclear which way to do it at many stores) and you then have to sign something or put in a 4-digit code, and it gets sent off to a server somewhere... then you have to manage limits on the amount you can spend, and you have to handle overcharge fees and interest rates....
Lightning Network is in it's infancy (as is Bitcoin) and this is the first version you're talking about. I've tried it on test net and it is exceptionally easy to use... easier, to me, than credit cards. And that's the *first version*. Imagine how simple it'll be once we get UX designers from dozens of different companies start making apps and APIs and Packages to make it easier for customers to use it and stores to integrate it.

Not to be a FUDster, but [there is, imo, a potential problem that Lightning Network might actually CAUSE if we don't get the mempool cleared prior to it](
Imagine Lightning Network is out, but no one can even connect to it because the mempool requires a $40 fee just to send the channel open transaction...
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:16:46
If you aren't lying, then you are just ignorant. [You can clearly see the mempool is at the 70-satoshis-per-byte level]( and the average transaction is 250 bytes, or half that when doing a segwit transaction. At the current price of $13,000 per bitcoin, it's this simple to figure out the price of a quick transaction:




@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:25
Bitcoin miners add another block to the blockchain every ten minutes. As of right now, those blocks are 1MB each, so they are technically adding 52.56 GB of data to the chain every year. The entire chain has to be kept on the computer of every full node. At 52GB a year, there's no real problem... the average node will be able to handle this for years to come, and harddrive space will keep getting cheaper and cheaper, so there's no real worry.
With Segwit, blocks can be as large as ~2.7MB, which means we're up to 140GB per year. This is still manageable for most nodes. You can get 1TB of harddrive space for $30 today, so we'd be fine for a while so long as harddrive space keeps getting cheaper.
With Segwit plus a 2x blocksize increase, you'd be at 280GB getting added per year. At this point, you're pretty much at the end of the reasonable limits for blocksize growth before hosting it becomes inaccessible to a lot of nodes. To put this in perspective, every node would have to have over 1.25TB of space just for the blockchain...
The problem with lower-end computers not being able to run nodes is two-fold:
* A lot of nodes will shut down, which means there are less of them in general, and we become less decentralized
* The ones that remain will represent more expensive computers, so a majority of them might be taken over by companies, which endangers Bitcoin's protection from government intervention. Companies bend to the government a lot faster than individuals.
Now that you understand that, the reason we can't have 133MB blocks is because you'd have 6,900GB of space added to the blockchain every year, and that would go to 18,874GB every year with Segwit.
Please note that these are maximums... the block size added every ten minutes is only as large as the amount of data actually being used, so there is a high likelihood that it wouldn't add that much to the chain... but if you create a system which allows people to never have to worry about not getting into a block, they will over-use the chain and we'll easily have too many transactions to stay decentralized.
Hence, you only want to set the blocksize to the amount necessary to allow for off-chain transactions to be transitioned into, and no more than that. The current argument among the community is about just how large that size is. I am personally an advocate for 2x increase plus segwit, with LN on top and further scaling like Schnorr Signatures. Most of the devs are for 1x plus segwit and LN, which is why that's the direction we're currently heading. Luke-jr, one of the main devs, sometimes advocates for a 0.3x (block size decrease) plus segwit and LN once LN is in place and properly utilized, but I personally don't think we're ever going to go that route.

I have to assume you're purposely misleading people here and are actually aware that the firecrackers he was selling were so large they are essentially an eighth-stick of dynamite.

You've just made a claim that is demonstrably false. A blocksize increase of 2x could clear the mempool within 24 hours. there are currently 175000 transactions pending. The current rate of removal is around 7 per second as per the current blocksize's allowance.
So with 7 extra transactions per second, we could clear (7 * 60 * 60 * 24) in a day, which is 604800
Even if you took a conservative estimate and said we do 3 transactions per second, that would still be 259200
**Try again.**

No, we expect it to be done out of greed. We just need them to understand how lucrative it would be for them. If their customers are turned off of Bitcoin because of the fees, they lose customers. If CoinBase eats the fees when you transfer through GDAX (hint: they do), they are spending a ton of money they don't need to be... likely far more that it would cost to hire some programmers to fix the issue, when you consider the volume Coinbase is controlling.
We just need to make them understand that they will prosper from implementing Segwit.

The "agreement" you're referring to is the New York Agreement? None of the bitcoin devs actually agreed to that, and it was clearly a take-over attempt. You should look into it a bit before you talk about it.

[Yup, looks like mempool recently pushed to the 140 satoshi fee range]( To put that in perspective, it was at the 10 satoshi range a few hours ago, so a bunch of people probably turned off their nodes recently or a lot of traffic got added this morning (most likely the latter).

There are too many camps to really shorten down the issue from every perspective, but here's an overview:
* Camp 1: There are people who are afraid of a large blocksize increase (8x or more) because they recognize that this could lead to centralization of the network. Instead of a blocksize increase, this camp wants to focus on soft-forks like Segwit and Schnorr Signatures and Lightning Network, moving most transactions off-chain. Most of the core devs are in this camp.
* Camp 2: There are people who want a large blocksize increase instead of soft-forks and they are fine with the idea that the blocksize will have to keep increasing if they become adopted in the mainstream. They either don't recognize the problem of centralization, or don't care. BCash supporters tend to be in this camp.
* Camp 3: There are people who have been influence by Camp 1 and don't really understand the issue, so they are against ANY blocksize increase. These people fight tooth-and-nail and act like anyone bringing up a blocksize increase as if it must be from a BCash shill. A lot of members are in this camp
* Camp 4: There are who recognize that a small blocksize increase (2x) could be initiated now, taking perhaps about two years to roll out, because within that time we will need the increase. They recognize that this could be done on top of Segwit and Schorr Signatures and Lightning Network, because if we achieve widescale adoption, we'll need a bit more than 1MB (or ~2.7MB with Segwit) blocks to handle all of that traffic, with LN requiring on-chain transactions to open and close channels. A few people in are finally coming into this camp.
**I am very much a supporter of camp 4, and I would love to discuss the issue with anyone interested in the subject.**

Let's say one person owned 100,000 Bitcoin and they wanted to make some money. They shorted Bitcoin through CME futures, then posted their 100,000 Bitcoin to be sold on the market. People see 100,000 Bitcoin suddenly for sale, undercutting the current price, so they know it'll go down, so they sell theirs quick out of fear they'll lose value... it creates a small snowball effect in which a lot of people sell until only strong hands are left. The initial seller now finishes the short, which nets him profit because bitcoin's price went down from all the people selling in addition to his own sale. Then, using less money than he sold for, he can buy it all back. He now has the same amount of bitcoin he started with, plus a bunch of essentially free money from quickly shorting bitcoin and causing the fall.

I'd suggest you read [this article on the subject](
Block increase allows Bitcoin to survive and thrive while being properly used by a much larger amount of people. It's currently unusable as a currency and Segwit adoption is moving too slowly to fix that problem. Lightning Network [has it's own problems]( stemming from the same source and we can't just expect it to fix things. 
We need action. Sooner than later.

How is this difficult? It seems like you're trying really hard (ineffectually) to imply that having a single dev team that we can actually depend on for good code and proper handling of the main implementation of the bitcoin protocol is bad. It's not.

I don't know about geli specifically, but I know that I've used Bit in Python to easily generate private keys and the public keys associated with them. Bit also lets you check balances, create and broadcast transactions, etc. A very simple open-source wallet could easily be created in it to only manage a single address.


The difference is that the seed generally allows you to store just that one string and it holds all of the info for the private keys for you. If you only want to keep track of a single address, you don't need the seed at all. You just need the private key to the address you want to hold onto.
20 words are easier to remember than a random string of digits, and much harder for a brute-force system to break. That's why seeds exist.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:58:50
The primary reason we have the current fees is because of the huge influx of people making transactions, on top of the (alleged) spam attack combined with the (alleged) collusion by miners to accept their own transactions and not "real" transactions to continue collecting fees.
Segwit adoption would solve a large portion of the problem, by increasing through-put to more than the current traffic by far, and making (alleged) spam attacks and (alleged) collusion by miners much more costly to keep up.
A 2x block size increase would do the same, but would require an emergency hard-fork to implement quickly, and a lot of people would be very upset over it, so it might split the community more than it is already split over the last 12 months (or more). Although I support a 2x blocksize increase, I don't personally support an emergency hard-fork and so I recognize it is not a reasonable fix for the **current** situation, but more of a future-proofing for the problems we are *definitely going to encounter* down the line.
Demanding a quick fix is worthless, and not ideal for the future of bitcoin. We should be working toward long-term solutions instead of fixes that seem nice now but cause problems down the line. The network congestion is a difficult problem, and not one that "raging" is going to solve, unless you are smart enough to direct that rage appropriately into real action.
* Disable your coinbase account, and let them know that you are moving to BitStamp because BitStamp has implemented Segwit, while Coinbase has dragged it's feet for a year over it, showing they don't support the future of Bitcoin.
* Complain to Gemini to get Segwit actually implemented instead of relying on confusion people have over them saying months ago that they were "Segwit ready" when they never actually started using Segwit.
* Complain to exchanges that don't do batched transactions, since they could help clear up a LOT of the network congestion
* Test Lightning Network implementations and encourage education about them so that we can be prepared when it comes out. Fight the FUD and disinformation that is so common with it already.
* Once Bitcoin Core 0.16 comes out (it's currently being fast-tracked and should be arriving soon) upgrade to it, and encourage others to do the same, as it makes upgrading to a Segwit wallet much easier than the current Bitcoin Core build (in which you have to do it through the console)

BCH does not have Segwit and has a terrible developer team. If I was going to switch away from BTC it would be to Litecoin, which has Segwit and a wonderful developer team, and has transactions that are just as fast and cheap as BCash.

A big player like Coinbase has to apply changes slow. I've been a professional software developer for a decade now and trust me when I say that things need to be done slowly and properly tested when you have that many customers and that much money flowing in and out of your business.
With that said, the owners of Coinbase were flippant on Segwit for too long and so now they're way behind... we demanded a timeline and they just said it would be done in 2018. At the very latest, it should be done by the end of Q1 2018 but they only committed to 2018.
Bitcoin is having a major problem right now and I think core expected that either the problem wouldn't arrive when it did, or Segwit would be adopted quicker than it is being adopted and the problem would be fixed by it.
We need a blocksize increase on top of Segwit, and we need it soon... very soon... core can do it, but I suspect they are going to stick to their guns, not even respond with an open dialogue about it, and doom Bitcoin to having an unusable network for months on end, potentially leading to huge gains by other coins which will hurt Bitcoin for years to come.

If a major mining group wanted to spam transactions at 6 Satoshis per byte, then prioritize those transactions so they get their own money back, plus the fee goes to them, then could do so and their only loss would be in opportunity cost from not confirming the highest fee transaction. 
So no, it isn't necessarily true that only the highest fee transaction can be used to spam. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:40:01
When you make a transaction, you add a fee that is based on Satoshis per byte, where most transactions are about 250 bytes  (dependent on a lot of factors). If there are more transactions than can fit in a block, the highest fee in Satoshis per byte is processed and the rest have to wait. 
So fees rise the longer there are unprocessed transactions, because more people are "competing" to get processed. 
It's not at all based on percentage of transaction value.

When it originally didn't import your fiat deposit, you probably should have put it in manually again to make sure it gets in there. When it processed the sell, it probably just added the fiat it had and error'd out on the server side, leaving you with no positive result of the sell.
I personally use cryptocompare's portfolio tab for my tracking, and would recommend it. You should be able to put in your purchase and sell data pretty quickly and see if you like it better.
If you want to stick with CoinTracking dot info, maybe try putting your buy and sell data in again, but making sure this time that your fiat deposit gets in there before continuing with the sell order.

I don't think you understand what I'm saying...
In order to use the lightning network, you have to create an on-chain transaction when you first connect to a lightning node. That's the transaction that I'm worried about. Right now we have the problem of a million new users where only 1% of them are doing a test transaction.... Imagine 100 million users and maybe 5% of them were actually connecting to a lightning node, which requires an on-chain transaction.
Imagine Lightning Node taking off, but no one can connect to a node because they have to wait for that first node connection transaction to actually occur. We could have a real problem on our hands.

I'd suggest Electrum if you want a wallet that uses Segwit. With that said, your concern is reasonable... but I think you're missing a key point.
There's no need to switch to Segwit if you aren't using the wallet... you can just sit your coins in a legacy wallet for as long as you want and that's fine. The problem comes with if you're actively using a legacy wallet to send funds. At that point, you'd be saving a lot of money by switching to Segwit. Move the coins once and pay the legacy fee, and then all fees afterward are cheaper because you're on Segwit. If you're actively using your wallet, you'll be saving money in the long run, so people should do it for their own interest.

It is an emergency if you are, like me, afraid for Bitcoin falling below the  marketshare... but even though that is my priority and so I'm pushing for a larger blocksize in the future... I understand that that isn't the core devs priority.
That's why I'm trying to push for a compromise... we get the larger blocks, but it comes in a reasonable time frame... it's not really reasonable to ask for an emergency hard fork at this time, I think. The devs have a top priority of bitcoin surviving as a currency and for that reason they iterate slow... their goal isn't to keep bitcoin  and you should recognize that.

I appreciate your input and respect your view, but suggesting to not worry about upcoming issues is the wrong outlook, in my opinion. Segwit, Schorr Signatures, and Lightning Network would not be a thing if people didn't look ahead, recognize potential problems, and discuss solutions. I don't want to just rely on the idea that the problem will work itself out or someone else will solve it.
We should be discussing problems so that at least some subset of the community can understand and talk about the problem as it is approaching, so that we can actually form a solution prior to the problem instead of waiting for it to hurt us.
You don't have to tell me Bitcoin isn't fragile, because I know that, and am in no way suggesting that it's going to break just because people get stuck and can't connect to Lightning Network for a few days when it starts to take off. What I'm saying is that **if we can avoid that frustration by thinking about solutions now, we should**.

Once Bitcoin Core had GUI support for segwit, a lot of people will switch over. They don't have it yet. 
I've messaged Coinbase and will be switching to another exchange when possible, because they basically said "yeah, no timeline on segwit" when they replied. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:51
Bitcoin's transaction system relies on the transaction data entering the "blocks" that make up the blockchain. There is only so much data that can fit in a block since each one has a 1MB limit (though with full Segwit adoption, that could raise to ~2.7MB). Since a block is "mined" every ten minutes, the limit equals out to somewhere between 3 to 7 transactions per second, at maximum.
If there were only 2 transactions per second, every transaction waiting for a block to go into would get in on the next available block, but we're currently pushing more (I'd estimate 10 transactions per second? But that's just a guess) so some of the transactions have to wait on what is called the "mempool", which is like a waiting list.
Now, if there was an expectation that the waiting list would be cleared when transaction traffic is lessened, everything would be fine... no one would have to "compete" to have their transaction processed first, but since the mempool is building up more and more, and there is no longer an expectation that the transactions will be cleared away quickly (or at all, since a transaction is eliminated if not cleared in about two weeks), people have to compete.
So how do they compete, you ask? They set a fee on their transaction, listed in satoshis per byte. So if you were sending 300 bytes with a 30 sat/b fee, you'd send 9000 satoshis along with the transaction amount and that 9000 satoshis would go to the miner that puts your transaction in a block.
But since other people might want to get their transaction in sooner, people keep competing, and only the highest satoshi-per-byte transactions get processed, so eventually you get a problem like what we are experiencing now, where the fee rate of transactions that are actually being processed is reaching ridiculous levels like 1000 satoshis per byte, 35x what they were a month ago.
But people will argue that if someone is still willing to pay that amount, then Bitcoin is still "useful"... it's just that it's no longer useful for the common person... it's useful for the person buying millions of dollars worth of it, so mainly investors... which is a very bad sign, imo.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:14:27


The question is: How many people will turn away from Bitcoin in that "matter of time", and how damaged will the network be for that time. If the mempool is overloaded for the next four months, it could allow a competitor coin to take our place. It seems unlikely now, with our recent gains, but it is a possibility we need to consider. If Bitcoin falls to number 2 on the list, it's going to hurt crypto as a whole. If Litecoin gets LN first and rises above us, we may never recover to the number 1 spot.
Again, it's unlikely, but it's possible... and we should worry about that possibility.

Sometime in the future, we're going to need at least double the blocksize we'll have even with Segwit. We can do a 2x emergency hard fork and fix the network until Segwit is ready, at which point we'll have (2MB * ~2.7MB = 5.4MB) with Segwit, which will be far below the size at which decentralization would be at risk.
We could coast with that size for a long, long time and figure out further scaling using off-chain solutions like LN or soft-forks like Schnorr Signatures... but right now, we should recognize that eventually, we'll need a 2x increase, so we should get it over with now.
I'm not personally an advocate for emergency hard-fork over a normal hard-fork (which might take 24 months to roll out), but we're more likely to get passed an emergency hard-fork at this point since everyone is freaking out... so I'm mentioning it as at least an option.

If you don't think people are going to deplete their channel commonly for the first year or so that LN is a thing, then I think it's you that doesn't understand it. On top of that, they have to open the channels first which is what my main concern is. If a million people try to open their first channel in one week, it's highly likely that the mempool will overfill and people will have to pay heavy fees just to open a channel.
Upping to 2x wouldn't damage our censorship resistance in any notable way. You're jumping the argument to 8MB but I'm not proposing that, as I think it would push us past a point where we can still be decentralized.

If your employer is connected to you through the same channel you primarily use, he can add to your lightning balance by paying you through the channel... so no, you don't have to open the channel with more funds than you will ever need. That's the entire point of the conversation about being paid through lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:13
My theory is that most people willing to pay the fees are the people buying to hold for a get-rich-quick scheme they think Bitcoin is. They're buying thousands of dollars worth, clogging up the mempool and thinking that the loss of a bit of money is fine if it'll make them rich in a few years.
The primary user of bitcoin wants it to be able to be used as a currency. Maybe not in stores at huge volume (that's what Lightning Network is for) but at least without &gt;$10 fees to buy and send smaller amounts (&lt;$100).
People are still willing to pay the fees, but by implying that that means things aren't broken for the average user, you're basically saying it's okay for only the rich to use Bitcoin... only the people who don't care about the fees. We can actually solve this problem for the average person and not just say "it's okay for the rich...".

Here's the thing... the fee problem is very real and very much something we should be talking about, but with that said, it is exacerbated by huge amounts when people use the "recommended" transaction fee, and you should really stop doing that.

@_date: 2017-12-14 09:20:41
The issue is how long it takes to start those 5 million node connections. The mempool can only handle, with full Segwit and Schoor signatures, maybe about 15 to 20 transactions per second. If we get 5 million new node connections in 3 days (which is very, *very* possible) we're overloaded.
We could easily get far more than that if a place like Amazon enables Lightning Network purchases. Imagine if Starbucks enabled it and there was a simple app on the app store to jump in and use it. Imagine how many new node connections would be made in just a few days... even with full Segwit adoption and Schorr signatures our block size will have to increase before that happens, or we'll be restricting more people than I think almost anyone here is expecting when it comes to new Bitcoin and LN users.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:05:47
First off, it's not... 2.1 Terabytes is prohibitively expensive for a large portion of the world. You live in a first world country. A lot of people don't. If Bitcoin is truly going to be a force to free people all over the world from the tyranny of fiat currency, it has to be accessible to all.
Second off, I left out an important addendum. 8 MB blocks only solves the problem *right now* and will in no way be enough to handle global acceptance of Bitcoin. You'd have to keep expanding, from 8 MB to 16 MB to 32 MB to 64 MB to 128 MB... and we can't just make changes now that assume storage will continue getting cheaper and more expansive at the current levels forever.
Third, every node has to download the blockchain... the larger the size of the blocks, the more that gets added every ten minutes. All over the world, not everyone has super fast internet connections, so keeping the blockchain small enough to reasonably download within a week in a third-world country is something to consider. 8 MB blocks will quickly make that an impossibility.
It's not a long-term solution. It's a cheap hack.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:24:27
Are you using a wallet like Electrum which could show you the byte size of your transaction? Because a Segwit-to-Segwit transaction should be significantly smaller, so unless you've raised your satoshis-per-byte fee setting, the fee should be significantly lower.

He is definitely making a slippery slope argument, and failing to mention that Segwit (and systems like it which improve the amount of transactions that can fit in the same space) can be upgraded to while also recognizing that it could be aided by also having a small 2x block size increase and that doesn't necessitate continued expansion to 10x or 100x or 100x like he's arguing.
I think Andreas is amazing, but is absolutely right to say Andreas is making an improper argument here.
While I agree that the slippery slope seems to be the idea BCash is going for (they seem to just be okay with scaling that way whenever it becomes necessary), it's not a proper argument against a 2x increase on top of Segwit for Bitcoin itself, which would help us be a lot more prepared for full-scale adoption after Segwit and LN are widely dispersed.

BitStamp is Segwit compatible. Use them.
Other than that, start demanding Segwit from Coinbase and Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:15
On top of that, Segwit and Lightning Network won't be enough if we reach a higher tier of mainstream adoption. Just the transactions from opening and closing LN channels will overload us if we don't start considering the blocksize increase. We're going to need **at least** a 2x increase so why not start now and get a feel for how much we'll need in the future while at the same time clearing away the **massive mempool block**

Right, but Segwit has to be adopted by the big players, and that isn't going to happen quickly because it requires hundreds of lines of code. A blocksize increase, which core devs already agree will eventually be necessary, could be done with 2 lines of code and no risk to their business, so CoinBase and Gemini could implement it virtually overnight, and then take their time with Segwit, as they should because code changes have to be made very carefully when that much money is going through your business.

If you can't even read my comment, I'm positive it's you that is missing the point.
CoinBase wants those customers you're describing... the ones that use their service, especially the off-chain purchases since they are expanding their brand and making bank off of it.
But bad news for Bitcoin means they get *less of those customers*. Big fees for legacy transactions also means that their other customer base, the ones that transfer from GDAX, are costing Coinbase a lot of money.
Both of these reasons are reason enough for them to implement Segwit, which won't hurt the first base of customers at all, and will actually increase it.

You could store your wallet file or your wallet seed on a USB drive, but this is about as secure as the drive... if someone has the drive, they have your bitcoin. If you encrypt the wallet file or the text file with your seed, it's that much more protected.
If you would be comfortable with that level of security in the case of that text file containing your bank account information, social security number, and a list of your greatest fears... you're probably fine.
If you want to do this, just locate the wallet file (location varies based on your wallet program... look it up) and copy it over. Or, if you remember your seed, you can do the text file, but I would suggest encrypting it. 7zip has pretty okay encryption for basic users but you can find higher encryption for sure.
I personally use PGP encryption on my seed and I store my PGP private key somewhere else entirely.

You have to recognize that these sites are verifying that the money you send them will actually arrive, and that in the case of an audit by the government, they'll have information to verify they weren't just laundering money... they had real customers.
They have customers buying and selling tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin every day. It would be unreasonable to assume they didn't need to verify some information to ensure they aren't going to get scammed with fake cards or false bank transfers.
If you want fast (and anonymous) bitcoin, an ATM is the way. You'll pay a premium, but it'll be fast. If you want semi-fast and semi-anonymous, localBitcoins is an option. If you want to work through an exchange.... it's going to take a while and they'll need to confirm you're a real person.

I would imagine litebit.eu would put the coins back in your account and you could just try again, but I'm not sure because I've never heard of litebit.eu before and I don't know how they handle failed transactions. You'd have to ask them by contacting their customer support. Remember, they're not bitcoin, they're a company that deals with bitcoin, so no one knows how they act except them, and their complications don't really represent Bitcoin as a whole...


It used to, but the current form of Bitcoin was not in any way prepared for the rush of people that comes from the media talking about it as if it's a get-rich-quick guarantee. If you [look at the mempool over the last three months]( it has become increasingly clogged and the fee system has gotten more and more complex and expensive.
Bitcoin plays it safe with changes, and therefore it sometimes has to move slow, which means that big changes like all of the attention it got recently can sometimes cause problems. My argument for a 2x blocksize is a simple change that has been considered for years, so I feel like now is the time to add it and fix this problem, especially considering that if we want mainstream adoption, we're going to need it eventually anyway.

I think we should work up to that, and not expect it within the next 5 years. VISA is a staple of the world economy... we can worry about that once we're at a point where it's normal to see Bitcoin used in brick and mortar shops at rare intervals (but at least once a month, whereas now it's rare that shops accepting bitcoin ever get anyone to even try).


Segwit 2.7MB and LN are going to allow us to scale at a rate we've never really imagined before, and it's going to give us a lot of freedom in terms of the next scaling conversation. We'll have plenty of time before we hit the next wall once most transactions are off-chain. So no, it won't put us at VISA levels, but it will put us at the levels I described above, I think, and we can start discussing the next scaling feature. Enough scaling features implemented, and we'll reach VISA levels. We just shouldn't be worrying about that now.
With that said, I personally advocate for a 2x increase on top of Segwit because I feel like  the average consumer isn't going to use Lightning Network for a while, and since we'll eventually need larger blocks anyway on top of Segwit, it would be great to start the process now.


I definitely don't advocate an immediate jump to 4x, and I'd personally like to think that if we got a 2x increase, then Segwit full adoption, then LN, we could continue from there with off-chain scaling and never think about bigger blocks again. At 4x, you're pushing the boundary of decentralization and I don't think that's a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:01


Right now the blockchain grows at 1MB per 10 minutes. That's only 52 GB per year. We could easily stand to grow at twice that without an issue. We could easily do 4x that with the rate at which storage space gets cheaper over time.


I think it's obvious to anyone looking ahead that at some point, we will need to stop storing the entirety of the blockchain. We'll have to store off a state as-of a certain date, then the transaction chain past that date... and every year or so we'll need to re-up that date and reform the state, and go from there. Because otherwise, every node will have to have literally decades of transaction data, which is useless.


Yes, because it takes a big code change and that's a slow thing for a huge company to implement, whereas a simple blocksize increase is about two lines of code.

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:27:56
In addition to this, for anyone not well-versed in how fees work:
Segwit lowers the byte-size of the message and you pay a fee in satoshis-per-byte, so your fee is lowered... but **also** since the transactions take up less space, more of them can be placed in a block, which means more transactions are going through, which means there are less transactions *waiting to go through* which means you don't have to compete as much to be processed sooner, which means you get to lower your satoshis-per-byte.
It's a feedback loop that will lower fees tremendously. We just need to get the big players to implement it and fees will go down enough that we can at least start worrying less while LN is being developed and implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:12:43

[If you're actually interested in my view and not just being argumentative or shilling for BCash, check out my comment here](
The tl;dr is that there are people, like me, who recognize that Segwit is absolutely integral to the future of Bitcoin, but also want a small blocksize increase. BCash will most likely never have Segwit, and has a pretty terrible dev team in general, so I wouldn't support it. If I were to move away from BTC, I'd go to Litecoin, but I'm sticking with BTC for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:25:28
It is an attempt to put BCH on equal footing with BTC, which a lot of people have a problem with, considering BCH is basically co-opting the Bitcoin name for it's brand recognition and Roger Ver is pushing for a movement wherein Bitcoin is referred to as Bitcoin Core so that it'll be easier to make "Bitcoin Cash" and "Bitcoin Core" seem like equals, so that a further push can insist Bitcoin Cash is *the* Bitcoin while Core is a failed experiment.
While the wallet doesn't do all that, it puts BCH and BTC on equal footing which many think is a slippery slope, especially considering how vile Roger Ver has been in so many of his previous actions, and how awful the sub is in general.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:04


BCash does not have lower fees than Litecoin. Perhaps you should do your research. Also, lower fees isn't tech... BCash uses a Blocksize increase. I prefer Litecoin's approach because I'm not an idiot, and I see that blocksize increase as the singular method of throughput improvement isn't viable in the long-term. Good luck with that.


Not really something I'm interested in


Laughable argument. I think Litecoin having segwit is a huge plus.

Why are you posting multiple reply comments instead of having a singular conversation? You seem like you're not handling this conversation well, mentally.
You keep claiming Segwit is "over complicated" but that's pretty inaccurate. Just because you and your shitty developers can't understand it, that doesn't make it overly complicated. It lowers the size of transactions so that more can fit into the blocks, while at the same time allowing for more block size so that it actually allows more transactions than BCash's current system.
On top of that, separating the witness data from a transaction allows for off-chain scaling solutions, which BCash will most likely never allow. What do you think is going to happen when your blocksize increase isn't enough? You'll just keep scaling by increasing block size... so your network will become centralized, only accessible to entities that have the money for 20,000 dollar servers.
Good luck with that.

Just in the last 48 hours, we've cut the mempool down to the 5-10 saotshi-per-byte level. This caused a lot of systems to automatically set their fees that low, which has created a problem where the "standard fee" has become the average, which means that every transaction is pretty much going to take the same general amount of time.
Previously, Coinbase's standard fee would be way above the average so it would go extremely quickly. You might have to wait an hour or two more now.
These problems are being sorted by adoption of segwit (which clears the mempool faster and might help us reach a time when we don't have built up transactions awaiting confirmations), the implementation of schorr signatures (lowers transaction size so there's less to clear) and lightning network (which puts a ton of transactions to off-chain so they don't fill the mempool at all).
Until then, the major problem with BTC is the amount of time transactions can take, and subsequently the fees associated with attempting to get your transactions to the front of the line.

They said they would do this on January 1st, and they only said they would have BCH available to withdrawal.
Then, in actuality, they released it far before January 1st and announced buy/sell would be coming shortly after, right after a mining difficulty rise, during one of the largest attack campaigns BCH has risen against BTC...
I can honestly say I wouldn't be surprised if they did that by accident, or accidentally leaked the info to someone that led the BCH attack instead of it being coordinated together with Coinbase... but I can also understand why the less reasonable or mature members of the sub would instantly jump to "Coinbase purposely fucked us over for it's own profits".

Not everyone worrying has to be a fucking shill.

During a sensitive time for Bitcoin, Coinbase freed their BCash to their customers and then enabled trading without a lot of warning other than having said they would free it up "By January 1st". There is also a lot of evidence that there was insider trading, where before the unannounced release, certain members of Coinbase leaked the information so people could buy-in before the expected run-up from the news.
Basically, on top of Coinbase already not enabling Segwit within a timeframe the community finds to be reasonable, they also seem to have enacted a direct attack on Bitcoin and an alliance with BCash and it's leadership.
While I agree that it's time to leave Coinbase and no longer support them (it was time a while ago, if we're being honest), **moving to Gemini is also a dumb move. They aren't Segwit compatible... This community is such a dumb mob sometimes and we're just going to be mad at Gemini soon. Switch to BitStamp instead, people.**

You created a use-case at the extreme instead of understanding that this is more about technological change, which there will always be people behind on. I've seen businesses that only accept cash because they can't figure out credit cards... and that's fine... they'll probably never accept bitcoin and that's really not an issue because they're going to fall behind on the new tech. I've seen businesses that could probably benefit from changing their POS system to Square, but it's too new for them to understand.
The point though, isn't to make sure EVERY business gets Bitcoin acceptance. The point is that new businesses, the type that were smart enough to use things like Square, will be able to use Bitcoin as well without that much more complication.


They report is as $3005 in income. It is legitimately that simple. Because bitcoin doesn't technically count as income yet, your income is the amount you get from when you exchange it for fiat.


I don't have whatever image you do for what "most people on this subreddit" are imagining. There are a minority of vocal idiots in all communities, so you should assume that just because things are said, that doesn't mean they are representative of a community consensus. Even upvotes are a bad representation, since most people upvote anything remotely positive since there's no "meh" button between up and down on reddit.
With that said, I'm possibly one of the people you think have it wrong. Once lightning network is implemented into mobile wallets and the UI hides the complication of it all, I see bitcoin being accepted in grocery stores... Starbucks... even farmers markets. LN will make transactions fast and cheap, and proper UX in the wallet apps will make it easy and approachable. That's all we really need to make it a viable form of currency for everyday use. The incentive for businesses will be the same for accepting credit and debit... it's a form of payment people will want to use because it'll be as simple as credit/debit transactions, except they'll have to carry one less thing (since they will be doing the payment on their phone, which they already have with them).

This is just misinformation... you're purposely making the argument that increasing the blocksize would centralize the system, without noting that a 2x increase would do nothing of the sort...

The main reason given by the exchanges for Segwit not already being implemented is that it takes time to fully implement a coding change like that... and that's a pretty reasonable excuse even though it was exacerbated by them taking too long to **start** the coding on the change.
A basic blocksize increase is about two lines of code. It's literally a variable switch. They'd have no excuse not to implement it quickly.

I've been trying out the Eclair testnet Lightning Network demo and I'm so incredibly, indescribably psyched for how wonderful it is and how much it's going to change the view of cryptocurrency.
Instant, fee-less (or nearly fee-less) transactions with simple web-store implementations of the payment system... it's a whole new world. The best part? We don't need Coinbase to go Segwit to get it working. Once the testnet app is sufficiently complete, they can turn it on for mainnet and we're ready to go.
A new day is dawning.

I'm not sure why you're being so argumentative, considering I wasn't saying anything about Bitcoin being better that credit cards... I was only pointing out that there is a fee with card payments, you just don't tend to see it because a lot of businesses eat the fee themselves and it is factored into the cost of their product.
You could probably stand to educate yourself on the lightning network, though. Once implemented, you won't need a lot of hardware. It will actually require less hardware than if you use Square in your business, which a lot of people do.
You could also stand to learn about taxes and cryptocurrency... it's not really a complicated subject, especially when compared to the myriad of other tax information a business owner is already required to know.

Much like Segwit, adoption will come in time, and relatively soon. Bech32 is, it seems, the future. If you don't plan on moving your bitcoin around too much in the near future, Bech32 is fine. If you need liquidity, don't upgrade to Bech32 yet because many places don't support it yet.

Is there a place to get some actual discussion with the devs regarding a timeline for a block size increase? We keep hearing that it'll come in time, after proper planning, but there doesn't seem to be an open dialogue about when and how, and the bitcoin network is basically unusable at this point as a currency.
I am so excited about Lightning Network, but the transactions made to open and close channels will be prohibitively expensive and the entire thing will be a non-starter if we don't increase the block size soon.
I'd be perfectly okay with getting news from CoinBase about Segwit so that the blocksize increase we kinda-sorta have could finally be implemented on a larger percentage of transactions... but in all honesty, it won't be enough.
We need action. There is a reasonable range that can allow us a blocksize increase without centralization, and we should be at the very least talking about it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:45
is talking about a very real problem of transaction fees and your suggestion is "make a company eat the fee, then just hold it because it's unusable as a currency, hoping it goes up in price even though every day, more and more people are turning away from it for that very reason."
The problem is that **it is unusable as a currency** and we should be talking about a solution to that, not ignoring it.

@_date: 2017-12-17 11:19:41
Depends how quickly you want to open it... since it's a transaction you place, and you put the fee on it.
It can be a one-time opening of a channel to a major hub... if you do that, you just have to pay the transaction fee (one high enough to get it confirmed) once and pay through it until your channel is closed (the rules of when channels close are still ambiguous to me, but a big rule is that you would generally close it once you spend all of the money you committed to the lightning network through that channel).

Honestly, if someone took one of the Bitcoin C++ libraries (like libbitcoin, not the ones that interact with the daemon through RPC), and made a few examples with them with companion videos:
- A simple wallet that works through the console
- A simple web-server
- A program that allows you to write data to the blockchain in a transaction
- A program that generates a payment request
- A program that reads a payment request and generates a payment with confirmation
I think it could really help people who want to start out and create projects for Bitcoin. Right now the library is out there and there are a few explanations of using it, but nothing cohesive and clear enough for people new to blockchain to understand what's actually happening in the background.

Plenty of great things came from copying other things. The communities of many alt-coins are trying very hard to achieve success, but not necessarily in the same way as BitCoin and while they may have started with a similar base, they aren't just riding coat-tails. They are working to expand and help spread the word of cryptocurrencies to the globe. They're working against the same draconian laws that BitCoin users are working against around the world. They're trying to help people and create something amazing.
For you to imply that this article is right to *shame* them for coming after BitCoin? It's idiotic. There are plenty of coins that tried to ride on the coat-tails of BitCoin, and they fell by the wayside. There are also at least a dozen coins with communities that want to pave their own way, and shouldn't be pushed in the dirt for it just because you feel superior to them.
So when I say it's tribalism, yes that does address the issue... because nothing else in the article is even worth talking about. It's all gibberish based on a premise that you should know is incorrect by now if you consider yourself an adult.

That is much more a problem of architecture and time than it is about BitCoin being inherently better than any of the altcoins. If you look at the economy growth of LiteCoin or DogeCoin, you can see that they are far behind Bitcoin, but if they were said to be following the same path of economic growth, they would be doing so at a much faster rate. They're just behind. If CoinBase decides tomorrow to accept LiteCoin, it will be accepted at at least 80% of the businesses BitCoin is accepted at within a month after....  That doesn't suddenly make you wrong, though, because *you're already wrong just based on the possibility of that happening*.

I've never really understood this argument. If Satoshi appeared and said "I started BitCoin as a joke, actually... didn't expect it to catch on" would everyone just stop taking it seriously? DogeCoin has a great community and they are extremely active in trying to increase their economic reach, help people, and be friendly... to hate them just because they may have started as a joke is ignorant.

If you put in a small fee, the transaction will currently sit in limbo until it is returned to the sender... I don't think you understand enough about Bitcoin, unless you're assuming the mempool will occasionally clear every week or so, which is demonstrably false.

I'd venture a guess that the average DogeCoin user is more involved in DogeCoin than the average BitCoin user is in BitCoin. They work together. They complete tasks together. They voice their opinions on the way things should work, and if they aren't working that way, they work together to make them work...
So what I'm saying is, your comparison is awful.

Someone like you, who understands scarcity, should understand that the inflation rate of DogeCoin is actually lower than BitCoins for the next few years... and even after that it's fairly comparable

Actually 0/0 is zero, not infinite. So since demand was also zero, it was 0.
There are priorities to mathematical laws. The fact that zero divided by anything is zero has a higher priority than anything divided by zero being infinite... Learn math.
*Technically speaking this is an [Indeterminate Form]( but if it theoretically could be defined, it would be 0. Either way it is not infinite...*

Doubtful. I believe they'll move away from the idea of it being meme-centered entirely and try to have the new branding convey the welcoming, fun aspect of the coin. There's no real consensus because it doesn't need to be discussed at the moment as the current branding only annoys the most stuffy-nosed people that the DogeCoin community don't want anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:14:05
There's actually a substantial amount of talk about re-branding it in the near future. It's a pretty simple thing to do and the community is very open to the idea. It will still be fun. It will still be a charitable and welcoming community.

It was a great community but it fell away after the developers stopped producing. I loved the fact that the community was so giving and inviting, but that ended, so yeah...

If you go by BTC value, it's lowest value was 0.0523
I think you might be confused, OP, by the fact that **when it was at it's lowest USD value, it was 0.002 BTC value lower than it is now**, but *it has had a lower BTC value than that, and going down by that amount of BTC value now wouldn't bring it anywhere close to it's lowest USD value*...

My mom is a financial advisor and just this month had me buy $1000 USD of bitcoin and hold it for her. She's having me hold it not because she can't figure it out, but because she has an agreement with a broker to not buy investments through anyone but them. 
It made me realize this is probably why a lot of financial advisors don't recommend bitcoin. On top of not feeling like they can understand it, there's a good chance they aren't allowed to manage it for others.

It's important to note you have to trust yourself to not fuck it up by mis-copying an address or sending to someone who isn't trustworthy enough to give you the promised thing you're paying for or accidentally revealing your private keys (even just leaving them on a shared computer). Since there is no trusted authority, you have no protection and therefore must be capable of handling it on your own.
Some people, if they took a moment, would recognize that as something they don't really want to accept.

With BCH being so new, a lot of their gains feel like speculation on them becoming "THE" bitcoin more than their actual value. If they had an entirely separate name and there was no idea being floated of them being "THE" bitcoin, I don't believe they would be getting anywhere near the same traction they are now.
It's honestly pretty shameful that they can't just go by Bcash. They define the issue as if it's a name that's supposed to be making fun of them... but really it's just a toxic move to call themselves Bitcoin Cash and to confuse customers and not stand on their own merit.

Prove that bitcoin hasn't been used to fund terrorism. Really think about that for a second and try to provide an argument that could lend any credibility to the idea that bitcoin couldn't fund and hasn't funded terrorism. It's insanity to think that there's any valuation that can be made of a method of payment through only whether it can or does fund terrorism. The payment method isn't to blame for that... and if anything, the fact that the money is being easily transferred from one country to another is a testament to that medium being effective, which is a good thing.
So no, I'm not huffing paint thinner and your attempts to patronize me instead of offering a rational argument are paper-thin. Grow the fuck up.

^ This is the claim. You made it. Support it. Alternatively: recognize it's ignorance.
Additionally, answer this question: If I showed you evidence that someone did support terrorism using Bitcoin, would that make Bitcoin bad, in your eyes? Or would you move the goal-post and make up some other inane argument?
How about we find out:
Here are some stories specifically about when the exact thing you said **never happens... happened**:

In addition, here is the source that your original link actually cited for it's story:

And here is a quote from the bottom: 


So unlike Bitcoin, a central authority in this case actually helped. If they had funded them with Bitcoin, who would have been working with law enforcement to bring the individual to justice? If the individual did an hour's worth of research in using Bitcoin, they could have anonymous access to cash from any part of the world, and no central authority would be able to access the wallet and find location or identification information like eBay and Paypal provided in the case YOU LINKED.

Serious question: Could a soft fork change the protocol so that if a block isn't full, there is a cap on satoshis per byte on transactions (as in, existing transactions have their fee lowered before they are put into the block)?
I'm sure the miners wouldn't go for it, but if we could get it passed, what would the long term effects be? The existing situation of people accidentally paying too much could be greatly mitigated, I think. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:05:56

As covered in another comment down the tree, this would only work if someone used the sending address as their change address, which most people don't do due to address reuse practices.
So it's a no-go.
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:55:59
I suppose on the first pass the only transactions it would work on is ones with the sending address listed, as it can be identified as the change address. If an output exists to the sending address, it's value is changed so that the miner fee is altered accordingly.

Although I agree with your main points, this particular argument has always been terrible. Yes, it's not the definition of censorship because it's a private area... but that's not really the point. If we have to call it something else just because it doesn't fit the exact definition of censorship, that doesn't change what it is.
In other words, if the mods truly are using their powers inappropriately to not just silence spam but also silence dissenting opinions and consolidate their own power (for the record, I don't really believe they are doing this), then calling it censorship even though it's a private area should be acceptable because in colloquial terms, that's what it is.

I highly doubt we'll ever reach a point again where "most" bitcoin users download the entire blockchain. I would need to know a lot more about transaction processing to really talk in detail about this, but maybe you could put the answer to this in layman's terms:
Is there a way that, in future bitcoin updates, transaction procession could be simplified in a way that allows nodes be more effective on the network? In other words, could mining and transaction processing be separated once it becomes economically feasible to do so?
If so, wouldn't we need far less nodes in relation to the total number of bitcoin users, compared to the current situation, where miners can move to another coin for a few days and our entire transaction pool backs up?
Again, let me admit I'm speaking from ignorance here. I don't pretend to understand the specifics of the tech, myself.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:32:38

There have been forks before, but this is easily the most contended. A lot of that is because a lot of money put itself behind this fork and they're attacking the community on purpose to lower confidence in Bitcoin and make themselves more money in the process.
It's waning already, but the community hasn't reacted well to the fear of the community being subverted into supporting the fork, which is an inferior technology.
There will probably always be attacks on Bitcoin, and they might even get worse... but that doesn't mean much when you think about mass adoption because you have to remember one thing: Most people have no idea what BCash even is. Ask people out in public if they know about Bitcoin, they do. Ask if they know about BCash... confused expressions only. Bitcoin is ubiquitous and it's still the king until that changes.

Although I fully believe in the future of Bitcoin, it should be noted that if it drops to a certain point, it will be **very bad** for BTC. If it is de-seated as the king, another coin community could push hard for acceptance by a lot of companies and if they become ubiquitous in the way Bitcoin is, they could stay the king and we could lose the spot, potentially permanently.
Bitcoin is great, so it's at the top, and it's at the top, so it's great. Falling from the top could very easily lead us to break the cycle and the price could possibly never recover if that happens.

Is there a current path we can take that would help incentivize Coinbase to get Segwit implemented? This seems like a logical thing to be focusing some effort into.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:59:05
That is extremely irrelevant to this post. Even if the core devs are geniuses, a fork like BCash is a risk because if it manages to get enough money into it to overtake Bitcoin, the precedent of another coin overtaking us will be set. Bitcoin is so powerful culturally because it has never been beaten. Take that away, and it becomes more and more likely that we get overtaken again and again until one day there's no expectation that we'll be on top. 
With that comes a loss of trust in crypto for a long time by the general public.

This is a valid point, but it should also be noted that if Bitcoin can so easily be altered in that negative way by outside forces, that is a problem we need to solve for the future.
One way is more people running full nodes, but I still don't believe it is ever going to be realistic for most end-users to download the entire block-chain. The average person doesn't want that big of a download on their computer. We need another way of making sure mempool can't be abandoned, like lowering the computational difficulty of confirming a transaction so that nodes are more effective and mempool is less dependent on miners.

Their blockchain has the ability to become much larger, much faster because their blocks have a maximum size of 8MB whereas our blocks are 1MB on legacy and up to around 2.7MB with Segwit, an addition we have that they don't.
The upcoming (or currently available, depending on how you see it) Lightning Network looks to push smaller transactions off-chain so that our blockchain isn't filled with a million coffee transactions (for example).
So if they ever get the amount of traffic we have (note: As of now, barely anyone uses BCH) their blockchain could grow to an entirely unmanageable size.
The current debate is over whether or not it's unacceptable for the average user to run their own node. They think it shouldn't be necessary and only miners or extremely large companies should run nodes. We think otherwise.

Create a json file containing inputs and outputs of ten bitcoin transactions. Compress it to half size using lossy compression and then attempt to create a program that will successfully read the data.

The fee set for a transaction is set by whatever program is generating the transaction. Some wallets err on the side of caution and set a higher fee than is necessary in order to get closer to a guarantee the transaction will process quickly. Some wallets set the fee low, and that sometimes causes processing to be delayed. Some wallets let you set the fee manually, which is my preferred method.
If he paid nearly 20 pounds to move the coins recently, it's a fuck up on either his part, or the wallets he chose. Choose better wallets in the future, ideally ones that let you control the fee. Then, learn how fees work in relation to the mempool. Complete your due diligence and you'll never overpay on fees again.

Corrected, thank you


Interesting, though it would be much harder to get a good estimate of how much is removed through batching (though it can easily be assumed to be quite a large amount). It would be especially interesting if someone could quantify how much smaller that input list got specifically because of how many less change transactions there were, since they would create larger value unspents and a much lower number of them, so subsequent transactions would have less inputs even if they weren't a batch transaction.
With that said, this post is mostly in response to the argument that since outputs are down, batching isn't responsible for the cleared mempool.

If fees increase in the future, it would be good to have moved them to a Segwit address now (even a new segwit paper wallet) so he can avoid those fees...
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:36:30
That's a difficult question to answer, given that fees are not directly correlated to the size of the mempool or the number of transactions pending. They share an indirect connection based on automatic fee determination systems in wallets and background systems within exchanges and other entities.
We're already at a point where an identical level of tx backlog won't cause an identical increase due to batching being above where it was four months ago by a factor of ~3x, but I think we're going to have to get to a point where every exchange batches before we can say we're really safe from a media rush, and even then, it largely depends on the size of the media rush.
If Starbucks announced they were looking to accept Bitcoin tomorrow, nothing we do today could prepare for that rush. If Bitcoin hit 100,000 a week from now, nothing we do this week could prepare for the rush from speculators... 
The best we can do is to continue improving through-put using batching, SegWit, Schnorr Signatures, and Lightning Network offsets and hope that we're prepared for the next big storm.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:24:07
Note that they implemented Segwit and Batching at the same time. That means the effect is lessened by a huge margin.
Imagine an exchange (theoretically) controlled 50% of the market in terms of transactions and Segwit support was (theoretically) at 0%. They announce they've implemented Segwit so you might think Segwit transaction support would rise to 50%, but if they also implemented batching in a way that lowered their overall transaction count by 80%, then suddenly they don't represent 50% of the transactions... they represent 16.6% so that's how much it raises on the Segwit Chart.
Now recognize that batching decreases transactions by far more than 80%, and you have your answer of why the effect wasn't as large as you were hoping.
If you want that number to rise, the key is to get the top ten exchanges as well as the average user to switch over to Segwit.

In addition to what everyone is saying (There was likely a spam attack and it seems to have died down), these things are also important to note:
* There was a huge media rush to Bitcoin with everyone thinking it would make them rich overnight, and that craze has temporarily ended, lowering traffic back down to November (normal) levels
* Segwit adoption has grown, which means each block contains more transactions, clearing the mempool faster

The bitcoin arrived in an address if it has 3 confirmations. You need to determine if you control that address. For clarification: You're saying the wallet that *should* control it does not? Did you remember to check the address was correct after copying and pasting it?

This is an extremely short-sighted response. I didn't say anything about there being a requirement of X transactions per block. I'm saying there should be a requirement of taking a certain percentage of transactions from the mempool (with a range, so small mempools under 10 transactions deep won't cause issues). If there are no pending transactions, the network can tell that and therefore won't think the mined block that is empty is anything out of the ordinary...
Obviously, the network would check against the mempool to ensure that the block is valid in the sense that it took in a reasonable amount of the mempool. If there was nothing there, no worries... if there was over 1 MB and the block is under 0.5 MB, that's a problem and the block should be rejected.

There is a correlation, but it's reverse of what you would assume if you didn't think it through.

Batch transactions are huge, but they contain more transaction per byte than normal transactions. Batch transactions are becoming more popular as time goes on, especially recently.
Segwit adoption and batch transaction adoption generally go together, since they each require an entity that is active in keeping up with the most effective cost-saving tech.
All it takes to get a 2MB+ block is for a few batch transactions to go out from a segwit address around the same time (within the same ~10 minute window)

Transactions per day isn't a proper metric, because if someone goes from making 100 transactions per day to making 1 batch transaction, your metric would show a decrease of 99 transactions. Instead, you should look at outputs per day.
Even that, though, isn't a perfect metric. If 10 of those previous 100 transactions were to the same person, a batch transaction would consolidate them into one output.
Does that make sense? There's no evidence to suggest the Bitcoin network is being used *less*, and plenty of evidence that it is being used *more efficiently*.

Batching lowers transaction count **and outputs** so this makes perfect sense, especially with all of the entities in crypto moving to batching of transactions.
So lower transaction and output count doesn't indicate less usage. A better metric would be movement volume in USD, which puts us at December 2017 levels, very normal after a huge media rush.

First off, anyone reading this please note that [the goalpost has been moved]( At first, transactions and outputs were down which must mean usage is down... but now that the fact that batching lowers transactions and outputs is out, the question becomes *"but who is batching?"*
I could point to [ZebPay]( [Quedex]( [BitPanda]( [Shapeshift]( or a number of others... but it makes more sense to look to batched transaction count. Fortunately, Blockchair allows us to look that up by month. Here is the last 12 months (check out the last four months in particular):
 Transactions with over 100 outputs, by month
* January 2017: 6463 - 
* February 2017 - 5538 - 
* March 2017: 6486- 
* April 2017 - 6837- 
* May 2017: 7937 - 
* June 2017 - 6615 - 
* July 2017: 6754 - 
* August 2017 - 6539 - 
* September 2017: 6210 - 
* October 2017 - 7562 - 
* November 2017: 9885 - 
* December 2017 - 15550 -

A bank's primary purpose to the average person is the ability to access their money and facilitate it's movement between entities. They give you a card which shares a protocol that a lot of people have systems built-in for to allow them to swipe the card and immediately get confirmation over the internet that the money is promised to them from your account by the bank.
If you can do that all from your phone, transferring value from an account that:
* ...you can access from anywhere with an internet connection
* ...only you control
* ...has no middle-man
* ...can transfer the value immediately upon your request
* ...Requires very little overhead from a company that wants to accept that payment
Then what purpose is a bank? **If** cryptocurrency hits the mainstream, banks will have to reform to be just about loans, since their primary purpose will go out the window.
That's a long way off, though, if it will even happen. The current establishment isn't going to go down without a fight.

This is, in general, how every crypto with a public ledger works. When you receive a new transaction, you get it as an "unspent" in your wallet instead of your wallet's balance changing.
I think the reason is that it's simpler that way to trace back transactions... to have the ledger be public and searchable. Each "unspent" links to the transaction you received it from, so you can find out exactly how much came from where.

That is specifically why I explicitly stated that:


Which is far different than just saying credit cards. A bank's primary service for the average consumer is it's ability to let them access their money from pretty much anywhere and facilitate it's movement between entities.
The average person uses banks for that multiple times a day, every day, whereas they get loans far less, the average person getting less than one a year.
You are correct that Bitcoin doesn't have an answer to loans, but "getting rid of banks" isn't really about getting rid of loans... it's about removing banks from the everyday of the average person, no longer having someone who technically controls your money when it comes to everyday use.

You won't get the private keys of the addresses that Coinbase is holding your bitcoin in. Instead, you have to get your own wallet and transfer the bitcoin to it. You can download Electrum from 
**Note:** If you want to transfer off of Coinbase now, you'll have to generate a Legacy address because they don't transfer to Segwit bech32 yet. They say they will have Segwit "implemented" by the end of the month, but they'll probably be late on that and even then they might not transfer to bech32. You could wait until they implement Segwit and see for yourself, but you might have to use Legacy if they don't support bech32 at that time.
Anyway, transfer your bitcoin from Coinbase to your wallet. If you transfer it over to GDAX first you can avoid transaction fees. Once it's in your Electrum wallet, you should test whether your passphrase properly loads the same wallet. Load Electrum and update the name so that it generates a new wallet. Say you have a passphrase already and put in the one you saved off. Once you're sure it generates the same wallet, you can delete the wallet files (File &gt; Delete Wallet) because the phrase is all you need.
And you're set...

Try to find someone under 70 years old that had never heard of Bitcoin in a first-world country. Six months ago you could probably find someone fairly quickly. Today you'd have some trouble.
This is a huge step to mass adoption. The next is making Bitcoin simpler and more liquid in it's movement. We need more Segwit adoption. We need Schnorr Signatures. We need lightning to reach a point where mainnet is safe and encouraged by the devs. We need to get payment processors for lightning that are well known and reputable. We need businesses to accept Bitcoin through those payment processors.
Once we have that established, we can start going for mass adoption, but we have a long way to go. Until someone can download an app, put in their bank or credit card info, buy bitcoin though the app, load it onto a lightning node that connects to a hub, and then pay at [Starbucks/Target/The Grocery Store] through that app, we won't be at mainstream adoption

This is a natural result of Bitcoin being incredibly popular, combined with a lot of big players in the space not using the most efficient methods of transacting. More and more exchanges are implementing SegWit and batching though, and Schnorr Signatures will increase through-put processing even more later this year, on top of Lightning offsetting transactions to off-chain.
Basically, Bitcoin improves as time goes on, but sometimes it's popularity spikes which causes the traffic to rise above it's ability to process...
That's just how any popular blockchain-utilizing crypto is going to work, unless it doesn't care about decentralization as much as Bitcoin does. If you aren't willing to be a part of the growing process, I mean absolutely no ill-will when I say you should potentially look into other coins.

@_date: 2018-02-02 23:05:36
There's been a rather odd pattern the last few days... if you center on just the last 4 days, there are large rises that then fall back down. The odd thing about those rises is:
* Hash-rate losses would explain them, but they don't correlate directly to hashrate at all
* It would make sense if they came about at certain times, i.e. when a certain country was active, but they don't follow a pattern when it comes to time.
Instead, they seem to jump up whenever the mempool is reaching the 1 to 2 satoshi-per-byte level.
Could anyone explain, without jumping to the conclusion of an attack, what might cause that particular pattern? My only guess is that some systems come online when low (1 to 5 satoshis / byte) fees are clearing, and then those systems deactivate when fees get high again. What those systems are doing with their transactions is unclear.
**edit: As of today (February 3rd), the trend seems to have stopped?**

As hard-core of a Bitcoin supporter as I am, it's not over. We currently have reached a point where we have a break from it... but another media rush combined with a hash-rate drop could easily fill the mempool again, and I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by how quickly another media rush happens.
The thing that a lot of people don't understand is the effect of the hash-rate drops. If you look over the last 6 months [on the mempool]( the biggest rise was from December 6th to December 7th... but look at the actual values. From 4AM on the 6th to 1PM on the 7th we gained 85 megabytes... but with an average block time of ten minutes and an average blocksize (at the time) of 1MB, we should have cleared 186 MB... so the real issue was either unfilled blocks, or a very low hashrate which led to much slower blocks. [If you actually check the hash rate]( there was a drop from the 5th to the 6th while [the difficulty chart]( shows a huge increase from the 6th to the 7th.
**Conclusion: The mempool didn't rise because of a huge amount of traffic... it rose because our difficulty adjustment happened right at a huge hash-rate spike, which then spiked back downward, during a slight rise in traffic. Basically, the difficulty was far too high for a while... AND IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN, EASILY, SO BE PREPARED.**

Update: [Binance halved their withdrawal fee. It's a start](
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:05:12
I showed that the hash-rate rose on the 5th, and you can see the difficulty adjustment as such on the 6th right as the hash-rate drops back down. When the difficulty adjustment is higher than it should be relative to the hash-rate, blocks go from being found an average of once every ten minutes to once every X minutes, a number higher than 10. This continues until the hash-rate rises to match the difficulty or the difficulty re-adjusts, which doesn't happen very quickly.
So if you're clearing 1 MB from the mempool every ten minutes at the normal rate, and then suddenly you're clearing 1 MB from the mempool every 15 minutes instead, that means that the throughput of the network just went from an average of 3 tx/second to 2 tx/second... which means the mempool starts filling, and people then have to compete to get processed, which means fees go up.
So yes, there is absolutely a connection between hash-rate and fees. You just didn't understand how Bitcoin works. Do you understand now?

It's global volume  over the last 24 hours is under $10,000 USD and 90% of it's volume is on one exchange. That means it's very, very easy to raise the price by 3000% or more. You just buy a single one for $80 and boom, the last sale was super high so that's the "price" on that exchange, and since that exchange is 90% of the volume total, it averages out to the "price" on CMC.
If you look on that exchanges page for that coin, you can scroll down the trade history and see someone bought a single one for 0.1 and another for 0.8, but every other sale is around 0.0004
So that's what happened, and it's already over... the price is back down.

We need a system which allows vendors to easily and quickly accept Bitcoin and then either immediately or at a delay sell that Bitcoin (or a specified portion) for fiat and have the fiat immediately deposited into a bank account.
Once we have that (lightning is the first step) we can get vendor adoption. As of right now, what we have is a lot of vendors that tried to start up using crypto and it was either not fast enough, not lucrative enough, or not consistent enough.
No crypto is really "there" yet in terms of being great for businesses. Hopefully we'll be the first with lightning. If we could get some large entity already embedded in businesses, like Square, to accept Lightning and handle the background conversions, we'd be golden... but that's a long way off.

If ten people send you 0.1 Bitcoin, you have a balance of 1.0 Bitcoin but to spend it you are actually spending the ten "inputs" worth 0.1 Bitcoin each. They get put into the transaction as the "inputs" and then the output, if you are sending 1 Bitcoin, is just the 1 output which equals the entire amount of all inputs added together.
But most transactions don't send the entire balance of a wallet or an amount that can easily be created by adding up the inputs to get the exact amount... so you have to send some back. If you have, for example, ten inputs of 0.1 Bitcoin each and you want to send 0.25 Bitcoin to someone, it will put three inputs of 0.1 into the transaction, and the outputs will be 0.25 to the recepient and 0.05 back to you, which will become it's own input for future transactions.

Evidence points to this rush being caused by a large entity (an exchange?) consolidating UXTOs, taking advantage of the low fees.

No, the overall total of non-change outputs in a consolidation transaction would be 1, because you're consolidating tons of inputs into a single address.
In a batch transaction, you are taking (for example) 100 transactions from (for example) 1 address, which would be 100 transactions with 2 outputs each (1 to the receiver, 1 returning the difference as a change output), so 200 outputs total, and you are turning it into (for example) 1 transaction with 101 outputs total (100 to the receivers and 1 returning the difference as a change output).
I will literally draw you a diagram if you need me to.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:29:39


The attack happened during the difficulty adjustment... it can clearly be seen from the links I provided. The difficulty adjusted from December 6th to 7th, rising far higher than the hash-rate warranted due to an upward spike of the hash-rate on the 5th. Whether this spike up and subsequent spike down was due to a BCH EDA attack is irrelevant to whether that same thing could happen again.

For example: If they controlled 50% of transactions and added segwit and then batched all single transactions to get a 5x decrease in transactions, they'd only add 16% to these charts, not 50%

The people who started shouting about Bitcoin not being used any more were deliberately intending to cause confusion. They say it's not being used so that people will respond saying it is... then they can point to transactions and people will respond saying that's because of batching... then they can point to outputs and people fail to respond because **most people don't understand that outputs drop just as much as transaction count when batching**. In addition, people see a huge media rush since December and they don't think that an upward trend overall can have a drop after a mini bubble. December marked the beginning of a mini-bubble which is now (most likely) over. We're back above levels seen at the beginning of December and we're rising again, this time at a more manageable and healthy rate.
The key to removing this misinformation and FUD is to educate people on how Bitcoin works. There will always be people forming narratives to hurt the king of crypto, and we have to fight every day in order to stay on top.

That entire community trash talked Lightning for **months**... saying it was a glorified tab system, it was insecure, it couldn't scale, it was vapor-ware.... every lie they could think of until every argument they had was debunked.
Now they're coming around to the idea of Lightning because they're sweating over the fact that once it's popular, no one will have any reason to use their shitty alt-coin. So every time I'm over in I downvote anything related to Lightning, to slow down the community's acceptance of it. I don't want them to have it. They don't deserve it, and when it becomes popular they'll wither away like the shitcoin they are.

In first world countries, this is true. In less developed parts of the world, this is very much false. A coin isn't truly decentralized unless it is available to all people (within reason), all over the world.


Maximum transactions on legacy per block are 5208. Maximum transactions with Segwit per block are 12195. That is more than doubling it, and that's before Schnorr Signatures, which are an immense increase in throughput all on their own.


Remember that Lightning Network is a second layer, and does not disable the primary layer. It just moves transactions off-chain for people who don't care about the trust model, which is most users. People can still use the trust model inherent within Bitcoin by making an on-chain transaction, especially considering the on-chain transactions will be lessened by the offset so the mempool should be mostly empty. Lightning is for everyday use, allowing millions of people to utilize Bitcoin for purchases. This is impossible for on-chain, blockchain-recorded transactions with Bitcoin, and also with Bitcoin Cash, because of how large the blocksize would have to be to do VISA-level transaction throughput. (hint, it's 550+ megabytes per block)


Yes, because our network was being utilized fully. If transactions could be moved off-chain and the public adopted that tech, the blocks would likely never be full again.


The thing is, Moore's law isn't gospel... it can be wrong, and technology doesn't spread at an even rate over the entire world. Instead of assuming people will keep up, it would be better to wait until the world is ready for the increase before implementing it. When it becomes normal for people all over the world to have 5+ TB drives and enough bandwidth to handle 200 GB per day on a full node, the Bitcoin community will most likely consider a 2x increase. At the moment though, that is not a reality for a large part of the world, so it would be unwise for us to implement the change, even if we assumed through Moore's Law that the world would keep up.


Nowhere in the Bitcoin roadmap does it specify that our development stops at SW and Schnorr Signatures. Further Segwit adoption, Schnorr Signatures, Lightning Network, MimbleWimble, Rootstock... these are all just this year. New technology will continue to be developed after that, to make things even better.


You're assuming that's the plan, but that's not what it is at all. They are focusing on these solutions now, and they will return to the blocksize discussion in the future, when it is more feasible. You also need to understand that aside from storage and bandwidth issues, a blocksize increase would cause a hard-fork. The last major hard-fork off of Bitcoin split the community in a way it hasn't really healed from (otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation) so having another one anytime soon is pretty much out of the question.


Lightning Network allows exponentially larger growth of throughput compared to every other proposed change at the moment, so it's being focused on. If people offset their transactions onto the Lightning Network, the core team will finally have some room to breathe instead of constantly being hounded by people talking about the throughput issue, and dealing with a community that is at war with itself.
I'd say it's a pretty good strategy to focus on LN for that reason.
I'd just like to say I'm enjoying this back and forth.

* They can see all transactions that have come to and from that address.
* Because of that, they can see the unspents that you have in it, and how much it has in total.
* If you send bitcoin frequently between that address and another, they can discern that you probably own both of those accounts.
* If at any time there was a transaction where the entire contents of an address went to that wallet, they can guess you owned that one. They can then look up the same information about that address to get more information about your possible habits.
 I'm unsure of

It's important to remember that time is valuable as well. VISA might charge 25 cents, but they clear within a few seconds. Bitcoin may only change 13 satoshis per byte, but it takes a few minutes to clear at best, and a day to clear in the worst case.
Lightning is how we beat VISA. Bitcoin on-chain transactions will most likely never beat VISA because it has ten minute blocks, and that's okay. That's what off-chain solutions are for.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:30:46
It absolutely can be, depending on the amount of increase. Increasing to around 2x is enormously different from increasing to (for example) 8x. It's the difference between 100 GB and 400 GB of daily bandwidth being used by a fully active node. In other words it's the difference between planning for what is realistically manageable today and hoping for what might be realistically manageable tomorrow. One is a valid and reasonable plan for a coin that is decentralized, the other represents a coin that has no interest in remaining decentralized.

It also doesn't work as a metric when batching is such a huge part of the drop, given that it expressly mentions:


Most change outputs are not to the same address as the inputs come from. Go into Electrum right now and see what happens if you send a small amount to someone... the change doesn't go to the sending address. So this chart is in no way accurate, and probably includes tons of change outputs.
So since change outputs drop by nearly 50% when batching, it lowers the value on this chart in a huge way.

[The mempool is experiencing a rush that started about 8 hours ago.](
Evidence points to this rush being caused by a large entity (an exchange?) consolidating UXTOs, taking advantage of the low fees. The mempool will most likely clear down to 2 sats/byte again by the end of the day, so just hold tight. Rushes like this will happen less and less as UXTOs run out, Segwit is adopted more, and batching becomes more and more popular.
Your transaction has a fee at 11.7 sats/byte and appeared on the mempool just as 20+ sats/byte transactions were appearing, so it'll clear fairly quickly, I think.

Although this is great news... it should be noted that if we're going to use sats/byte as a metric, we need to recognize that a Satoshi on our network is worth 5x to 6x what it is worth on their network, so even if we reach parity in sats/byte we're paying 5x as much.
So we need to go lower if we really want to compare fees.

For anyone wondering:
*If this was an attack:* They added 2000 transactions and 17,500,000 bytes to the mempool. If they paid 1 satoshi per byte, at the current cost of ~$8500 per Bitcoin, that attack cost them the equivalent of $1487.50 USD. It is, however, likely they paid less than 1 satoshi per byte. It's even possible they only paid 1 satoshi per transaction (the minimum fee) which makes this a very cheap attack at only $0.17
*Another interesting note:* At 17,500,000 bytes for 2000 transactions, the average transaction size during this event was over 8500 bytes. Given that the average bitcoin transaction is anywhere from 255 to 500 bytes, it would seem whatever created this phenomenon is creating huge transactions.

You don't understand how batching works... Allow me to explain, and you can let me know once you realize your mistake.
Take a look at any block of transactions. [Here is a good example... expand the list at the bottom until you can see about 100 or so](
You might see a couple of transactions [like this one]( which only have 1 output. That means someone sent 100% (minus the miner fee) of the value of the inputs to a single output. *This is how you appear to think most transactions are: A single output... which means if you batch 100 them, you get the same number of outputs, 100.*
[Now go back to the list of transaction in the block, and look at the average output of transactions. Is it 1?]( **No, the average is actually over 2.** The main reason transactions have multiple outputs is due to how fees work.
If you have two inputs of 1,000,000 satoshis each, totaling 2,000,000 satoshis, and you want to send your friend 1,500,000 satoshis, what happens if you use a single output to your friend's address? *The remaining 500,000 satoshis go to the mining fee.* So what do you do to avoid that and pay a more reasonable amount in miner fees? You have a second output that returns the difference (the total input minus the receiver value minus the miner fee) back to your **change address**.
So now that you understand that, what do you think happens when you have 1,000,000 transactions, each with a change address output in addition to the receiver output? Consolidate that down to (for this theoretical situation) 1,000 transations with 1,000 receiver outputs each. How many change outputs does each transaction need? **The answer is ONE.**
Boom. You batched 1,000,000 transactions into 1,000 and outputs went from 2,000,000 to 1,001,000.
**tl;dr: Batching lowers outputs by the same amount as it lowers transactions, because of change outputs.**

@_date: 2018-02-09 20:14:51
I've actually been noticing this particular pattern a lot since we broke through the 10 satoshis per byte limit at the end of January. When the low satoshi/byte barriers get touched, there is a sudden influx of transactions which seems unnatural.
It could be spammers, and in this sub a lot of people are going to tell you that it is... but that's also conjecture and there's no way to prove it.
It could also be a natural result of previously high fees... a system could have been waiting to send out it's transactions and when the fees were low enough, it sent them out in waves... each time the fees went back down, they did it again, so they can send all of their transactions cheaply.
It's impossible to say the real reason. I will say, however, that the movement between February 8th, 15:22 and 17:46 is unprecedented, and very difficult to describe as anything but a spam attack. You can clearly see the 1 sat/byte grouping grow at a very constant rate over that time period, and if you look back on the last 3 months that's never really happened before. Never like that.
Either way, these alleged attacks are not very effective as you can see, and they won't last forever because they cost a lot to produce. The bitcoin network is getting better at processing transactions every day, so it'll get more and more expensive to attack it as we go.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:55:08
Because batching lowers transaction count and outputs significantly, and it's very difficult to tell exactly by how much unless you process a huge amount of data through a node, I'd say the most viable metric left is volume in USD, and even that isn't very accurate and would have to be measured alongside price changes to make it sensible.
It would be nice if one of the block explorers like BlockChair could implement a system to process the batch transactions and try to determine by way of outputs how many original transactions it would have been. All they would have to do is multiply [batch outputs - 1] by 2 and add that number to the non-batched transaction count, and you'd have a good rough estimate of what the transaction could would be without batching.

[As you can see, the drop began in December]( but as you said, didn't reach "below year average" until January. That seems to imply there is actually more traffic overall, and batching just managed to lower the amount significantly and get us back to "below year average" even though we're handling more traffic than before.
Also note though that 100+ output transactions were all that I covered, and not a proper metric of exactly how much batching was going on in those months. It's an estimate. It's entirely possible 50+ (or maybe 200+?) output transactions would be a better metric, but it's difficult to say so I'll leave up what I posted.

Right, but if they know their own, then they can make an educated guess. If their mempool is over 1 MB and the block is under 0.5 MB, they should just reject it, knowing that the miner who mined that block is either purposely rejecting transactions, or has a relatively low mempool which represents a different problem entirely and an unhealthy node.

Please explain how you could possibly think this isn't a metric. Batched transaction count and batched output count can be and is measured by plenty of blockchain explorers, and can easily be used to show that the drop from September to February was entirely caused by batching and therefore doesn't represent a drop in actual use.


This new narrative of adding "in 2018" seems to have just started yesterday... and aims to completely ignore that a huge media rush happened in December and only died down at the beginning of February. It rose and then dropped all of crypto...

Because he puts far more weight on the future of Bitcoin than on it functioning right now for the average user. On one hand, I have to admit that is the best way to manage Bitcoin and we should probably at least listen to him a bit.
Basically, Segwit is a blocksize increase, and he is afraid of the blockchain becoming irreparably large too quickly, before Lightning can offset a huge amount of the transactions. Segwit transactions are smaller, but if it gets fully utilized and then people start using the network more because there is more throughput, we'll go from putting 1 MB blocks on the chain to putting 2+ MB blocks on the chain.

A lot of people misunderstand what happened to fill the mempool, so let me explain.
The thing that a lot of people don't understand is the effect of the hash-rate drops and difficulty adjustments. If you [look over the last 6 months on the mempool]( the biggest rise was from December 6th to December 7th... but look at the actual values. From 4AM on the 6th to 1PM on the 7th we gained 85 megabytes... but with an average block time of ten minutes and an average blocksize (at the time) of 1MB, we should have cleared ~186 MB... so the real issue was either unfilled blocks, or a very low hashrate compared to difficulty which led to much slower blocks. [If you actually check the hash rate]( there was a drop from the 5th to the 6th while [the difficulty chart]( shows a huge increase from the 6th to the 7th.
**Conclusion: The mempool didn't rise because of a huge amount of traffic... it rose because our difficulty adjustment happened right at a huge hash-rate spike, which then spiked back downward, during a slight rise in traffic. Basically, the difficulty was far too high for a while... AND IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN, EASILY, SO BE PREPARED.**
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:43:39
I like to remind people of this as well, but reaching parity in satoshis/byte is an important milestone regardless, because it means the separation in transaction cost is due entirely to the value of the coin now.

Right, my point is that you shouldn't trust the trend to continue. Be careful with your bitcoin... especially since a lot of people are expecting a bull run soon, you don't want to sell on a Friday and have it be the day the bull run starts... you'll have to buy in higher than you sold.

* March 2017: 6486-

* November 2017: 9885 - 
* December 2017 - 15550 - 
* January 2018 - 17141 - 
It literally increased nearly 200% in the last four months.
Also, I'll repeat this point as it seems needed:


Blockchain.info has this metric but it's entirely useless.... because you can't tell which addresses are change addresses unless it goes back to the same address that is sending it, which isn't usual for most wallet software. They generally have a separate change address.

[The mempool is experiencing a rush that started about 8 hours ago.](
Right around the time this transaction was posted is when transactions above 20 sats/byte started joining the mempool, so your transaction is under a number of them at the moment. I would expect it to clear within the next two hours, as the rush looks to have stopped, and I would bet the pool will be back down to 2 sats/byte and lower by the end of the day.

If you're paying $2, it is because you have chosen to do so by using the wrong wallet or not setting your fee correctly. Currently transactions are processing at around 3 to 5 cents in fees.
If you need help setting yourself up to no longer pay $2 fees let me know. If it's through Coinbase, start transferring to GDAX first and letting Coinbase eat the fee. Also if it's Coinbase, recognize that the $2 is going to Coinbase and has nothing to do with Bitcoin's actual fees.

This is sort of useless given that it doesn't give us (or blockchain.info) data on which address is the change output, so the chart can't properly represent the amount that goes to others, since it probably just assumes something isn't a change address unless it's the same as the sending address.

A confirmation is just the number of blocks that it is in. It will go up by 1 about every ten minutes if it's a real transaction. Tomorrow it will be over 100. It's very normal for any amount.

Coinbase charges a huge amount on top of the actual miner fee, plus they pay a way-too-big miner fee. If you use the option to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX, they will eat both fees so you can transfer for free.
Electrum lets you set your fee, so if you were paying 2 dollars, you just need to set your fee correctly and you must have had it set high. You can reasonably set your fee to 5 sats/byte right now and get your transaction cleared quickly.
[According to the current mempool data, transactions at 2 sats/byte are getting cleared consistently](
`2 sats/byte * 300 bytes/tx / (100,000,000) sats/bitcoin) * (10,000 USD/bitcoin) = $0.06`
I said 3 cents transactions are clearing right now (1 sat/byte) but I would recommend paying the extra and just going with 2 or even 5 sats/byte to ensure very quick processing.

There's really no reason to get snippy just because you don't understand it. Every node has a mempool, and a healthy network is represented by nodes with similar mempools, at least in size.
If a node has a mempool over X size (let's say 1 MB) and a block comes in under Y size (let's say 0.5 MB), it should reject that block. The basic idea is really that simple.

The Bitcoin Core software developers could have folded to **immense** pressure to just increase the blocksize, but they didn't. They stayed strong and eventually educated the community as to [the real reason relying solely on a blocksize increase would have been a mistake]( Even I was caught up in the idea that we should double the block size on top of Segwit, and I've since realized how wise the devs were on that issue (although I'm still currently against luke-jr's idea of lowering the block size...).
They make choices for the long term, and that is what Bitcoin is all about... we're the front-runnings in a revolution of economics which might eventually change the entire world for the better, giving people freedom over their money and the ability to transfer any amount of wealth to any other internet-connected person in the entire world nearly instantly, nearly free.
I believe in Bitcoin because I've seen this community band together against countless attacks, endless FUD, and the resistance of the entire world to accept change. The future is coming, and we are it.

You have a road and people are complaining that the road is always clogged with traffic. Your friend says to make the road bigger, but you don't think that'll work because if it gets clogged again, you'll have to make it bigger again and eventually you'll have a road that's way too big.
You decide you want to use new science to shrink cars down while they're being driven, or even teleport the cars immediately to their destination so they barely have to touch the road. Your friend says that's crazy and it's too complicated, but you realize his road expansion solution won't work, so you decide that even though it's complicated, you're going to do it.
You finish the car shrinking tech and you're testing out the final parts of your teleportation method. You realize the people who sell cars are refusing to sell the cars you designed that are compatible with shrinking and teleportation tech, even though it'll make them a lot of money because they can sell way more cars in the long run and have happy customers. You work on getting those people to work with you and talk to you more openly so that this problem doesn't exist in the future.
You realize that the most important thing you learned through-out all of this is that you shouldn't go for the easy route that causes problems down the line. Instead, you should go with the most correct route you can think of, regardless of whether it'll take a lot of time, and you should work closely with the people who support that solution so that they can implement it quickly and everyone can prosper.

While this is mostly true (actually, not needing a hard-fork is pretty important), Segwit represents a much smaller blocksize increase as well as a throughput increase per MB, the latter being the type of technology we should really be pushing for (can't wait for Schnorr Signatures!).
The post is asking why we can't **just** increase the blocksize. We didn't. We increased it a small amount (as opposed to 8x) and then increased throughput per MB, and the on-going plan is to continue using throughput increases as well as moving off-chain.
The most important thing to note is that we didn't **just** use a blocksize increase, so in the future we won't have a precedent of a blocksize increase being the method by which we solve our problems.

I think we would agree on a lot about what software is capable of... I definitely agree when it comes to toilets, although I can definitely foresee a machine which goes toilet to toilet in a public lavatory, sticks something akin to a pipe snake with sensors on it down the toilet to check for clogs, uses a machine to unclog it using the snake and a pump, then cleans the sensors and continues on. It's entirely possible someone could create toilets with this system built-in in the next decade.
With that said, there are entire industries currently at risk for take-over by machines. For example, trucking in the US utilizes 3.5 million drivers... automated trucks are coming in a big way within the next three decades, and will replace a large portion of those drivers.
That's 1% of America out of work real quick, and that's only one industry. What about shipping container handling at boatyards? What about check-out clerks at grocery stores? Telemarketers?
 Watch repair? Bookkeepers? Warehouse handlers? Postal Service clerks? These are industries at risk just in the next decade or two.
All I'm saying is that **general AI is still far off, I agree... but you don't need general AI to get machines to replace a lot of industries.**

Opening a channel takes at least 1 block to be discovered since it requires an on-chain transaction. So 0 to 1 channels takes anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes.

My mom told me it sounded like a scam and she didn't want me to invest.
She's now invested $1000 when it was just under 3k and her investment is worth about $2000 now and she's happy.
She's a financial adviser so I get why she was so hesitant... it's her job to be very very careful with people's money... but it sucks she didn't trust me when I was telling her about it all back in 2013. She could have invested far more than me with far less risk if it all went downhill... could be retired now.

@_date: 2018-02-10 21:40:19
You want to play on the swingset in your yard but there's a lot of kids in your family so you sometimes have to wait until your brothers and sisters are done. Your dad and mom can't agree on how to fix this so you can all play together. They don't even know how many kids they eventually want to have, but they know it's a lot. Your dad says that he wants to build 7 more swing sets in the yard (so 8 total), so there will always be enough for all the kids. Your mom thinks that's not a real solution because what if you want to have more kids than that? Are you just going to keep adding swing sets until you have to buy more land to fit them all in?
So your mom decides that instead, they should upgrade the swing set so that each set has more than one swing on it. She compromises that you can have two swing sets in the yard, but each set will also have two swings on it instead of 1. Your dad says making a swing set with two swings is more difficult than just buying an additional swingset (or 7) but your mom says that even though it's complicated, it's a better solution, especially since she wants a ton more kids.
Your mom sets out to build the new swing set with two swings on it. She realizes the company that makes swing set kits doesn't sell kits with two swings on a single swing set, and those companies seem to think they can make more money selling swing sets with only one swing, because then if people want two swings they'll buy two sets. Your mom calls them and explains to them that they'll make more customers and more sales if they give people what they actually want, which is more swings in a single set. They eventually agree, realizing they could sell a lot more swing sets if they actually listen to what their customers want.
You realize your mom was right, and that if you take the simplest route when solving a problem, it might just cause problems down the line. Instead, you should think carefully about whether a more difficult solution might work better over the long term, and let you and your siblings have more time to play. You realize it's a good idea to work with people to get better solutions instead of just relying on yourself, as well. You also realize you should listen to your mom because she's smart and loves you.
tl;dr: I started out writing an ELI3 but it just got really, really long lol.

Batching has a lot more to do with the answer. It depends a lot on how many entities in the space implement batching and how effectively they do it. Segwit is still at a low percentage, so we aren't seeing huge gains from it yet.

On top of the fact that I already mentioned why that metric doesn't really represent usage, the link you posted puts us at around the level of traffic we were at in August, right around the time Segwit launched before people started a huge speculation rush.

The thing about that is that miners want to get paid... if we don't raise our offered fee, they will be mining empty blocks and giving up money. It's really a matter of who gives in first. Unfortunately, I think the miners will hold out longer than people trying to transact, especially since miners can rest on the fact they get the block reward regardless.

You're talking about a drop from December to February, which is the normal drop that happens after a huge media rush that happened around all of crypto. The conversation is about the false idea that Bitcoin's traffic is down *aside from the drop in the media rush*.
Batching nearly perfectly explains the drop from October to February, which puts us at a very healthy level.

There is no such thing as artificial demand, there is only demand. If people are purposely spamming the pool, or if a media rush causes speculative investors to jump in and fill the mempool with speculative movement... those are real use-cases for Bitcoin and our network needs to prepare for them. On top of that, the more "real" movement we get in terms of adoption, the more we'll need network through-put.
As such, improving through-put and evolving the network is a necessity.

The fees on Coinbase are still high because they take a huge cut of your money. To avoid this, transfer from Coinbase to GDAX and withdraw through GDAX. They'll eat the fee so you'll get what is essentially a fee-less transaction.

The bitcoin network handles around 7 transactions per second (~4000 per ~10 minute period), and that number is increasing slowly. It can clearly handle micro transactions. A better way to describe Bitcoin's problem is that it cannot handle the volume of transactions (that it currently has due to it's popularity), due to the fact that the developers would like expansion of throughput to come through careful planning and consensus instead of forcing it on people.
Its lack of ability to handle more than it's current throughput is due to decisions made in order to ensure it can scale in the future. If a p2p payment system can't scale, and therefore is a time bomb that will explode at an arbitrary time in the future, it's lame to look at a coin that is handling scaling and actually looking to the future and act as though its doing things wrong.
That's the issue with a large, large majority of alt-coins right now. They don't scale. Bitcoin's dev team is planning for the long run, not making a quick buck right now. With that decision comes slow but effective scaling. A lot of people don't like the wait... The right thing to do at this point is talk about real solutions that can be implemented relatively quickly and don't lead to scaling issues down the line.
It should also be noted that the community as a whole doesn't blame "United Bitcoin" which is why OP was downvoted heavily here for implying they were the problem.

How many big companies will drop support of Bitcoin (even just temporarily) because they don't want to risk being on the wrong side of the fork and losing a ton of money?

Try to think of the game itself as free... making a character is free... you aren't getting paid to play the game... but the items you have to pay for with cash and you can sell for cash. Some people buy the items hoping that people will pay more cash for those items later, if some news about the game makes those items more valuable to people. Kind of like a ship in EVE Online... someone might buy one for $1000 dollars but then a war happens and people need ships so someone offers to pay $1200 for that same ship... and anyone can sell theirs at that price, and then the latest price a ship was sold at is the "current price" of ships. The price can rise and fall based on how much demand there are for ships.
For this analogy, imagine the game only has one type of item and the ONLY way to get the item is to pay cash for it. A long time ago, people used to dedicate their computer processing to host the server and that earned them the items... but now pretty much everyone just buys them with cash because the amount of processing needed to get a single item is so high.
The source code is just up on github. That doesn't even need an analogy because it works fine for both the game and bitcoin.

I've heard a lot of analogies for the split but none of them do a good job of making it simple for the layman so here's my attempt. 
Imagine you play an MMO and you have a character with good items. Imagine this MMO is okay with you selling your characters items for cash. Now, one day they say they're going to make a new server with slightly different rules. Any character that exists on server A on the day of the split will still exist. In addition,  a clone of it will exist on server B, but will adhere to the slightly changed rules. 
Some people will want to play on server A and some will want to play on server B. Some will want to play on both. Items you have on server A can't be transferred to server B and the same goes for the other direction. You can sell items from either server for cash so long as the buyer wants items on that server.  Whatever happens to your character on server A doesn't affect your character on server B. They are completely separate.
So if you were planning on selling your items, you can sell items from server A to server A players and items from server B to server B players. You can sell items on server B for cash, then use that to buy items on server A. You can even,  on certain item exchange sites, set up a trade where you give up an item on server A and immediately get an item on server B, but it won't be the same item... it'll have to be from someone on server B who has the server B item and wants his character on server A to have the item you are trading.

The game server splits in the past have been relatively small in the sense that they weren't advertised as much as this one. This split represents a higher chance of taking players from server A due to the massive amount of money spent by the developers pushing for it, pretending their new rule-set is the future. They've taken advantage of a community that is currently split between ideas of what server changes are needed for the game to be better in the future and to get over some issues it currently has with lag and it's economy system.

You shouldn't keep your coins anywhere but in your own wallet unless they are being actively used on an exchange. So yes, take them off CoinBase.

This is an extremely biased source, but even with it, it doesn't connect the two. It just shows that one of the engineers mentioned he liked seeing ANTIFA and other groups because he wanted "anti-fascist groups in the age of Trump"
That doesn't connect him to them... as much as I would love to see hard evidence that they are somehow connected, this isn't it. We can't just pretend this is hard evidence.

There's a large difference between a coin without unique technology and a scam. Dogecoin was build around community, and I was right to believe in that, so I profited. Simple as that.

^ No, perhaps I wasn't clear. "Playing the game" in this analogy is just being involved in bitcoin. A "character" would be a wallet". An "item" is a bitcoin.
When the game first started, you could dedicate processor power to the game's server and it would give you items. To create scarcity in the game's economy, the amount of processing power you'd have to give to get a single item raised exponentially, to the point that most people just buy the items for cash or barter for items from other games in an online market.
There are still people who prefer to dedicate processing power to get items, and THOSE people use specialized consoles (ASICs) to do so since normal computers can't cut it anymore.

Also, your opinion is shit. Trust that most people want to be educated, and BitCoin needs to create a compromise where it is simpler to understand so that we can reach global acceptance at the average person's level. That is how we win, as a community.

He's not directly involved but he's showing outright support for it in his continuing mission to support anything other than Bitcoin because he failed in his original attempts to split off from it:

Not BitCoins, but DogeCoins... held for 3 years, sold for 42k USD what I had bought for 11k at the beginning. Paid off my college loans.

It's a hard analogy to stretch to that specific problem, but I'll try:
The MMO in the analogy is no longer owned by a company, it is run by a group of developers who picked up the source since it was open and online, and the "main" game is only the main game because they've been running server A for so long (pretty much since the beginning) and the most people have been on it.
So when server B comes up, it isn't because they split it... it's because another group of developers finds the code and decides they will make a similar game (and it's open and legal to do so) and when they do that, they take the database of characters and items from the moment they split as well.
So basically, two groups who believe the game should work in different ways are now running their own game servers, A and B. Literally anyone could come in and say they want an entirely new ruleset and make server C tomorrow. In fact, if you look at the history of the game, there have been a ton of copies in the past that didn't get enough users to sustain themselves so they essentially shut down after trying for a while. In that sense, server A is still server A but server B should probably be called server G or something at this point... but for this example, just imagine it's the first attempt to split off.

Buy and HODL. Stop buying after August 1st if it splits, but keep HODLing until a consensus is reached. Once that happens, the price will return... and if BIP 148 wins out, the price will soar. It may  take time, but HODLing is the best move here.

If no one has their private key, it's gone... no one will be able to access it. If the family has access to the coins:
- As far as the legal definition, it is capital that he owns and as such falls to whoever his benefactor is. 
- It is technically not part of his estate so there shouldn't be any estate tax effect on it, though there is a valid tax for when they convert it to fiat (it counts as capital gains).
If the authorities don't know he has it, you might be best off just having them hold on to it, maybe even spend it directly at some point so it's never taxed.

Imagine you got some cash from a friend, pulled out your leather wallet from your pocket, put the cash in, and place the wallet somewhere. Then three years later, you ask around for if anyone has seen that wallet because you aren't sure where you put it way back then.
That's pretty much the equivalent of asking how to reclaim your bitcoins without your keys / bitcoin wallet.

You're assuming they buy the bitcoin at the same time as they sell it to you, so they're only making the profit from the fee... but if they bought it at a different time, they would make a lot more by not selling when it's lower than it might be soon.
I personally am erring on the side of believing CoinBase is not attempting any funny business like that. When the price fluctuates quickly, they get a huge surge of traffic... that's all this is, imo.

August 1st is a deadline... if the community as a whole hasn't changed over to a new system, the coin will split into two temporarily until a decision is made. (Look up UASF and bip148 for more info)
If that happens, the price will plummet, and a lot of companies will lose faith in BitCoin for a long.... loooong time. Personally, I'm hoping there's a crash and panic before August 1st so I can buy a ton and then just wait out the years until it returns greater than ever. Ideally, the crash would happen before August 1st, causing the miners holding back on the change to switch over and then before August 1st we'd get a consensus so the coin would soar immediately... but that's probably not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:08:59
If a decision is made by the community to the point of being certain that things will go smoothly August 1st... would there even be a crash?

Yes, the coin would need to at least double from it's plummet cost. I don't think that is unlikely in the least after a winner is declared.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:40:59
I have 3.5 coins at the moment. I will be attempting to get as many as possible before August 1st without putting myself in a financial hole.
I don't think there is an "enough" at the moment... BitCoin is about to soar, even if it plummets first because of a split. Everything is coming together, the whole world is talking about crypto now... it's time.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:23:07
Check with your bank to make sure the transaction wasn't denied. My bank occasionally thinks me buying bitcoin is someone having stolen my card... and I don't want to tell them to always trust CoinBase because if someone DOES steal my card, I would imagine that's the first thing they'd buy with it if they had any sense.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:41:57


If the split occurs, you'd get more benefit from buying both coins after the split when the price has plummeted, before the winner is determined. That way, when one of those coins becomes the winner, you hold way more of it than you would have if you'd just bought before the split and held through it.
With that said, if the split doesn't occur, you could really miss out on getting in when it's low due to everyone being scared of the split.

Do you realize the market cap is just determined by way of averaging out the price on the high-volume markets and multiplying it by the supply? All you're doing is reversing that. You'd be better off using the API from the markets to get an accurate price at any given time.

No currency has an inherent value. It's all assumed. Look at countries where their currency has lost all value, and understand that can happen to ANY currency, because we all just trade currency based on it's assumed value, and that value can change.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:54:20
It's very hard to approximate. Right now, we're nowhere near the support we need to avoid a split, but as the date approaches, volatile human nature will take hold. No one with money in BitCoin wants it to split unless they want to buy a lot more. A split will cause massive loss of trust in BitCoin and we would most likely have a very difficult time becoming  again if it occurred. A bunch of major exchanges might shut down... 
So maybe everyone will get scared and suddenly get in line with BIP 148 and no split will occur... but it's impossible to say at the moment. I, personally, am betting on a split. I hold coins now, and I'll buy more (equally of each coin) if a split occurs and the price plummets. Even if we never get back to  the price will correct to a point where a lot of profit can be made after the smoke clears.
I generally don't like thinking of BitCoin as an investment, but if there was ever a time when it was an investment.... these three months are it. As far as trying out different coins... I can't answer that. I don't know what other coins, which seem to react strongly to any move BitCoin makes, will do if all this goes down.

Even though I don't agree with what you're saying (I'm HODLing for the long haul) I can definitely understand where you're coming from. As part of the early adopters, you helped make this coin what it is. Never forget that, and ignore anyone who says you're jumping ship because you're scared or that you were never really a Bitcoiner. You were a part of this. Be proud.
Congratulations on your success, and I hope it continues wherever you go.
