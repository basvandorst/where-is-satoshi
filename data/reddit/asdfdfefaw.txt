1)OSTK does not hold bitcoin. you can't prove me wrong because its a fact.
2)you're an idiot who will lose money

can't upvote this guy enough

you know 10-Qs get filed quarterly? maybe you could post a link to a conference call where pat discusses bitcoins more in depth. another fun thing to do might be to look at OSTK's YTD performance. 


wow you bought at under 100 and didn't sell at 1000. that is amazing and you are the picture of an irrational market. keep holding bro soon its gonna be 200%.

something that people don't seem to have realized yet: all the exchanges themselves hold large amounts of bitcoins. this is simply one exchange trying a little bit harder than a competing exchange to reduce their exposure to bitcoin. its not just the users of the exchanges that are selling; its also the exchanges desperately trying to get out of the market.
good luck.

somebody tipped me bitcoins but the price tanked 15% before I could get to an exchange to sell them
th-th-th-thanks bitcoin!

idk, bitpay sponsored them? what does that prove other than you bought a shitty tv on closeout?


no...its not.


yeah like launder money ;)


stopping you right there. bitcoins aren't money. nobody but drug dealers will accept bitcoins directly to their books. its not money. its barely a payment system. 


you probably fucking suck at chess.

LMAO bitcoin stopped your reckless spending because now your money is spending itself!
nice post. maybe someday you'll realize this is just another reckless spending habit.

that article was from march and they've been accepting bitcoins since the beginning of the year and you can't post a single shred of evidence that they actually have bitcoins on their books. WSJ is a retail investor gossip rag and proves nothing.
good for you. you can be a dick on the internet. how much are you up this year on your bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-25 16:48:19


fixed that for ya big guy ;)
literally nobody is impressed with bitcoin outside of your circle jerk (which is actually getting smaller and smaller). get your life together and find a new passion. bitcoin will never be useful for anything other than buying illegal drugs on the internet.

show me the 10-Q/10-K

none of those companies hold -a single- bitcoin, so no, they're not "falling for it" (nice bait btw). none of those companies really and truly accept bitcoin anyways. when you use your bitcoins on those websites you are actually purchasing a service instead of a good. you are paying bitpay bitcoins to purchase goods on one of those websites for you. think about it for a bit. there isn't a single -worthwhile- retailer who really and truly accepts bitcoins as a currency.
good luck out there though kid, you're gonna need it.
