What's the easiest way to trade this shit for btc? I don't want to register at several marketplaces
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:27:26
I'm sorry to tell you, but you did something wrong with the configuration. If you started mining in 2010, you would have a shitload of coins. A radeon 4850 could mine roughly 3.5 BTC per Day

So you never heard about Bitcoin, because it never crashed from $80 to $2

will Payla support Lightning?

The crash is bad for he bitcoin ecosystem. It scares ordinary people away. A rocksolid 19.000$ would be much better for bitcoin as an usefull currency. Only traders profit from cheap coins. If you want to gamble use altcoins, i want an alternative to fiat money and not a gambling tool

where is the 2011 correction?
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:25:55
Don't tell people what to buy, it's kind of shady. Better tell them to inform themselves about bitcoin.

What's wrong with you? Post it in 2 days when it's online.

is Lightning still beta?

Most people are laughting at the guy who spends 10.000 btc for a pizza, but i think he is one of the most important persons for bitcoin. He demonstrated that bitcoin has a real value and a usage. When everyone keeps his bitcoin and no one spends them, why the should have a value above zero?
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:55:01


look at these people, who take the current price and say he paid millions for a pizza. 


What i didn't get?

At which point you get paid if you buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:09:34
what advantage has a ledger? why not a USB flash drive with encrypted wallet?
edit: why the downvotes? it was a simple question. I cant see the purpose of a hardware wallet besides 2fa. A usb drive can be a cold storage for every altcoin
