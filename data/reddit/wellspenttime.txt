What? 2FA is not for brute force attacks. 2FA is for malware; keyloggers RAT's and such. I find it to be a healthy security practice to always assume a hacker has a rat running on my PC. Because of 2fa, the hacker could at worst make some truly embarresing facebook posts from my fb account

If they announce to repay a certain amount of btc, it will be tough, but remember that all their customers also suddenly would be insanely rich. If the customers keep trading, even at a very reduced btc volume and with the same fees, bfx earnings would be through the roof.

Shorting on that scale might not be a great idea. In short, it's the opposite of investing. The cool thing about investing, though, is that the worst you can do is losing 100% of the investment. For shorting, imagine a company's stock price increasing by 1000%.... You would lose 900% of your investment, meaning that if you shorted for 100, you would end up owing 800

That's not entirely accurate. You buy short contracts if you are trading on a futures market. You can also just short bitcoin directly

Yes a short can be a legal contract, but that's not the definition of a short, nor the common way to trade short on *spot* markets. A short is simply a sale of a borrowed commodity. You are usually bound by a contract to pay back your loan, but that doesn't mean the short itself is bound by a contract.
Moreover, you are not bound to buy back the stock at market price. On a futures market, the value of your position is just automatically decreased until forced liquidation or settlement. On the spot exchange, you already gave the stock, and got the payment for it. All interaction with the counterparty is finished immediately after the short position is "opened". As I mentioned, the lender probably won't be happy if you don't pay your loan back, but that's a different issue.
A short is a sale, not a contract.

Please see other comments in regards to trezor. Trezor is without doubt the best choice, and a software wallet is the second best choice.
However, **IF** you decide against using your personal software or hardware wallet, I highly recommend that you open accounts at a few different exchanges, and keep an equal amount at each. In other words - don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Exchanges I believe are reputable and safe until proven otherwise is: (in descending order)
* Okcoin.com (not available for US residents or -citizens)
* Kraken.com
* Poloniex.com
* Bitstamp.com
* btc-e.com
* Bitmex.com
* 1broker.com
Exchanges that are proven not to be safe:
* Bitfinex.com
If you go for this, please don't be an idiot - make sure you are using 2FA on all of your accounts.

That is not not how a democracy is supposed to work. Despite the fact that it may be a common flaw in a democracy, that makes your statement a strawman argument.
Regardless of whether or not core wants bitcoin to be a democracy, you are stuck with democracy-like features, and therefore forced to cater to the majority. It has been clear that core is not taking the strategy of accepting and working together with entities that have different opinions during the scaling debate and implementation of segwit. When you completely reject the idea of a democracy, even when used in the context of being accepting of different opinions, there cannot be much hope of even an attempt of reconciliation. It is then to be expected that all your proposals are fought tooth and nail by everyone with different opinions.
On a more personal note, I think it's sad to see that core is so adamantly refusing any compromise, even in their rhetoric, toward uniting the community and finding common ground for progress and scaling. I hope you are successful in implementing segwit, but I'm saddened by the divide and conflict in the community that your strategy and unyielding rhetoric has caused.
I hope that you in the future will consider changing your strategy and working toward amending the rifts in the community. Personally I think you will find that progress will come much easier.

You're a bit out of luck being from Arizona, as there are quite a few good exchanges that don't accept customers from your state. I pretty sure  does, however, so that would be my recommendation. If you can't find an option you're happy with, you should check out r/bitcoinmarkets

I'm not on either side in this debate, but your argument is the same as saying "Why don't core just fork btc so they can have segwit adopted?"
It's pretty clear that they want **bitcoin**, not a btc fork, to have a bigger blocksize. 
Also, isn't this exactly the point of signaling, that different entities can have different opinions like in a democracy? It's not hard to understand why you guys are not getting along considering the line of argument you are displayed here, which implies: "If you don't agree with core, create your own fork. We are going to do what we want with bitcoin regardless of what you think".
This type of reasoning displays an arrogance and clearly implies that for core, reaching a consensus is just a necessary inconvenience that you'd rather be without. In contrast to a true democracy, where all opinions are respected. Surely, a democratic government wouldn't ask citizens with a different political opinion to move to a different country. 
I don't know if this is actually what you mean by that statement, but it surely gives off that vibe. Regardless of whether or not this is a misinterpretation of your true intention with that statement, I would suggest you take it back, and instead find a better line of reasoning that can actually contribute to the uniting of the bitcoin community, not hinder it.

I agree, unless:
1. You'd like to keep the btc for a while, watching it accumulate in value
2. You're kinda tech-savvy, and wouldn't mind spending a few hours reading about how it's done, and then test it with a tiny amount ($5) of your own savings first.
Honestly, it's not as hard as me and u/MukkeDK might make it seem, but it's a huge amount of money, and people have a tendency to make huge mistakes when they don't know what they are doing/are doing something for the first time

I think I can answer that. Instead of having automoderator send the author a message, it sends the mods a message every time something is removed because of this rule. That means it will be reviewed manually within short time, and re-approved if it was relevant.
