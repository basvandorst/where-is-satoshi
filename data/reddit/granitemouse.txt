Yay tips to spread bitcoin love!
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:09:45
Already happening.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:27:33
I thought that way as well. Lately though I have just taken that $25 cash that I would have spent, bought BTC and then used the BTC instead to support the bitcoin economy.

I responded to the email with:
You should look into using Bitcoin as a payment option. It's instant, no charge backs, and lower fees on your end. This will provide you a lot of press if you are the first ride service to embrace this and give you the edge over Uber. The credit card system can still be used to verify identity, but a Bitcoin payment option will a win for everyone.
We should all hit up Lyft, if enough people do they will look into it for sure.

When I contacted support about no longer being able to make transactions, this was the response. It depends on which state you are in. Have no idea the logic in this decision.
"We’ve recently launched improved security measures related to our Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer processes. We have temporarily limited transactions in some locations, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your home state is one of these locations. 
Read more here: 
We do not have an exact timeframe for reactivation of locations, but we will make an announcement via our website, blog, Facebook page and Twitter account as we enable new locations. We will also send you a notification email when we begin to process transactions for your state. 
Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and will let you know as soon as something changes.
Best,

The buy sell price is a little closer now. When I posted that there was an $8 dollar difference. Now it is $3. Usually it seems they are about the same. That is the base price before the fee.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:33:49
Payment received, much thanks for the fun and keeping your word as promised. Good sport with an honorable man.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:08:09
If you contact support, more often than not they will push through the transaction and honor the original price. When it happened to me it was a problem with my bank rejecting it. Also support is slow right now so expect it to take a day or two.

Send Ken a PM on bitcointalk - kslaughter. If you aren't already on bitcointalk you will have to make a hello post in the newbie forum or the activemining forum in order to be able to send PMs.

Get in, today's high price is tomorrow's bargain. When there are temporary crashes consider those bitcoins on sale and buy more. Don't wait or you will be kicking yourself for not getting in at $350 when you had the chance. All of this is provided that you have the money to invest and not need right away.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:42:10
Excellent. Then let the games begin.
@_date: 2013-10-14 06:17:53
I was really sad to see this go, I had plans to start using these guys. Don't understand how they were making money with their no fees policy. Hopefully someone else takes this up, it is a good idea for the consumer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:06:30
Cheapair.com accepts bitcoins. Prices seem comparable to expedia and kayak, think I'm going to get my Christmas ticket with them.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:05:24
Exciting. There would have been no sport to it if it just soared to $385 in an hour. Some sliding will make it quite interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:29:35
And we have hit $385! That was a fun bet, much thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:31:27
I appreciate it but I'm good supporting this bet. I believe in BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:30:42
Cool, accessing Reddit on an app on my phone so I didn't see the sidebar. Will check that out, much thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:36:03
Camp BX is going to start working with bank transfers tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:40:40
Although the past sales said it would take four business days to receive the money, it only took 2-3. My last one took a few extra days because of a problem they had but other than that it has been a seamless easy experience. As I understand it, that problem is fixed as well.
@_date: 2013-10-14 06:20:02
Actually I was trying to make a joke. But I didn't realize provably was an actual word, I thought it was probably and misspelled. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:07:08
For BTCT go to bitcointalk and PM Burnside. This happened to me before, he will sort you out. If you aren't already on bitcointalk you will have to go to newbie forum and make one post before you are allowed to PM anyone.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:02:00
This is exciting. As if I needed another reason to repeatedly check the price hahaha.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:59:02
What about bitcoin gains from mining securities such as ASICMINER which are then sold? Or weekly dividends generated from the securities?

Easy way to bring them out of cold storage is "scan the private key" to a wallet on blockchain.info and send whatever you want to put back into cold storage to a new paper wallet. All of the coins residing in the paper wallet must be brought online when you do this. And you can put as many coins as you feel comfortable with in the paper wallet cold storage.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:27:46
If you just ordered them you can cancel the order. Then set up CC verification, and make a new order.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:00:15
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:20:54
I really like that, that's awesome. Well done.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:03:54
Mine was sent to my specified withdrawal address. And it was only 15 cents worth USD.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:24:42
I have always wondered this too. What happens when you buy bitcoins at many different prices, then convert some to fiat? Do you use the lowest rate purchased to determine gain? Or the first rate purchased?
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:17:04
Today's high price is tomorrow's bargain. If you wait you will just miss out on an opportunity. The best thing is to think long term. Get in, buy more over time, and don't sweat the drops, just see them as a further opportunity to get bitcoins on sale. Nobody can predict the price rising or falling. This weekends drop only shows me that we shouldn't be fearing a bubble pop, this is experiential growth. Even if the price falls it is still going to recover. I believe in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:53:13
Guessing not Wal-Mart since they pulled out of eGifter. Target would be awesome. Kroger or Whole Foods as well.
@_date: 2013-09-14 07:56:51
I do really enjoy some provably trustworthy bets. That sounds extremely legitimate. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:16:42
Yes, we have to watch out for illicit actors. Like Lindsey Lohan. 
I realize that only makes sense for people watching.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:38:14
I sir will take you bet. I will honor my word, you honor yours. $385 gox within 3 days. Agreed?
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:15:21
Unless I am mistaken, eGifter has Wal-Mart and Gyft has K-Mart and CVS.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:50:43
Some interesting slides just now. The game goes on. Not entirely sure how the bitcoin tip aspect of reddit works. Do I need to post a  virgin btc address for this bet?
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:44:25
Is that show airing now somewhere? I saw it had an Indie Go Go campaign to get the show going that is still happening. I like to watch that type of stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:10:53
Is Tom Carpenter the only Senator there? Hahaha
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:56:52
Is Coinbase now using Gox as the buy price and Bitstamp as the sell price? That doesn't seem right.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:54:10
Awesome, I will check out the first one and more than likely you will soon have a new donor as well. :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:27:57
I had a similar thing happen and they honored the original price as well.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:47:47
Thanks! Yes when the mini collapse started I thought uh oh hahahaha.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:40:04
You can always search the public address on blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:48:37
Same problem. Reinstalling didn't work for me either.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:10:52
That is incredibly awesome. What town do you live in?
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:03:21
Outlook hazy, Ask again later.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:12:25
This use to happen all of the time. Sometimes you could check back a little later and they would have coins again.
