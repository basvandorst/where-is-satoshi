"It won’t be at 9000, but definitely will be at around 9600-9800 area"
You are such a brilliant analyzer. You were so right and I were so wrong! ... Told you bruv..

What magic crystal ball are you looking into to make the assumption that it CAN'T/WON'T hit 9000 or below? Nobody can know that for sure.

I would not complain if you are right. However, bitcoin is not as easy to analyse as a normal stock. No matter good your analyse is it does not take more that a little fud to crack it. More and more normal people start buying bitcoins, not just huge corperations, but the regular man in the street. And people are sheep. If you see the price of the bitcoin decrease by 5%, one might start to second guess the initial buy. I have several friends who have been down this road. Fud and Human thoughts and ideas are just as important factors to the bitcoin price as anything else. Therefore one can never be certain about the drops until they hit you right in the noggin. Hopefully the bull run is "hard" enough to not be too much injured by this and the price can increase and the hype will increase.

I fear you are wrong. As we already know, nothing is linear with crypto. Even though the bitcoin passes the 10.000$ mark does not mean it won't be at 9000$ tomorrow.
