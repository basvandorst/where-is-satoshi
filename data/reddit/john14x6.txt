But it's pretty easy to make bitcoin 100% untraceable still so I'm not understanding except for the reason  as you said "only they can see the full picture" which would make what they create as bad as any other centralized currency.

Why don't they just use bitcoin or am I missing something?

Here's a good read if you're having trouble understanding my previous statement.

Yes. It stands for an end to a corrupt banking system and the ability to see what your taxes go to instead of relying on your trust in your government saying the money is going where they say it is.

What happens to other lost and buried treasures I guess.

What if we all just chilled and let the spam tx go through so they actually lose money? I know that's highly improbable but is it possible?

Welcome back friend.

Advantage is being taken of those who are investing ignorantly. This will not end well for those involved.

Made a Reddit just for this group. Who controls the fees? Never really got that. Been using and hodling for a year now so kind of a noob so sorry if my questions are dumb. If it's the exchanges are controlling the fees wouldn't that mean we're just being ripped off for a quick buck? My fees were never really that bad when I started using BTC but it's been a while since I've made any transactions.

Know what the editor should have told the writer? 
HODL....on writing such an asinine opinionated article..
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:51:31
Honestly, thank you both. It makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:53
HODL! 
Real talk, buy the low if not putting yourself in financial risk.

What happens when you apply that logic to fiat or gold?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:25
I saw that. Went back to screenshot and it was fixed but the truth got out.

Depends on your definition of fine.
