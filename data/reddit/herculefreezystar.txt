Thats exactly how I feel. I tried it once but apparently being a self employed freelancer doesnt count and they didnt think I was a real person.

Gold has a value cause you can make a bunch of important shit out of it and it is a finite natural resource.

Scion was just Toyota's youth division in the west. The cars are identical except for the badges and some trimmings.

My friends say I buy Cryptos the way people bet on horses. I find a coin I think looks interesting because of its logo or name, research it a bit and then decide if its worth buying. 
I bought Ripple coin because I just wanted to make JoJo jokes with my friends and Ripple = Hamon.

I just wanna get a enough bitcoin to get an '86 Corolla and not feel bad when I spend all my time working on it.

Hopefully alot of people sell at 10k and it drops back dowb to 6k so we can all do it over again.

Fuck, I have like $8 in Doge from like 2 years ago. I should see what that is up to nowadays. Probably like a whole $8.03 if I am lucky.

Now I just gotta get $11k. I got a feeling noone would want to sell me $100 worth of coin for $110.

You cant stop the PirateBay, man. Itll hopefully be around forever.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:37
Where do you get your coin from then?

I got gifted $5 worth of Dogecoin over 2 years ago and forgot about it until last night. Now I have $22 worth of Bitcoin and I am just along for the ride.
Might buy $100 more at some point idk, im not a rich man.
