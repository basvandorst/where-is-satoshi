It's true. In Europe, tips aren't the norm. This, at least in Spain, equates to the most terrible service you're ever going to get. Staff act as if they are doing you a favor by serving you because they have no vested interest.
The owners should have spent some time doing some research. Maybe the present model in the US could use some tweaks, but this is not the solution. The result will almost always be bad service.

Reading through most comments, I gotta say that the Bitcoin community is pretty divided on the issue of anonimity.
While it is true that banks and governments do regularly screw people, those very same people, when screwed by any company, want to take their beef to the government and get justice for being screwed. 
Well, I hate to break it to you, but if you want protection from thievery, you're going to have to let the governments regulate Bitcoin. As long as it is unregulated, it will continue to be good only for the underground. 
The funny thing here is, Bitcoin is in its infancy, noone can predict where it's going, but you can be sure of one thing, it's going nowhere if regular Joes don't adopt it, and regular Joes like the sound of regulation and deposit insurances.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

My two cents... I would answer that no. Source, I own an exchange license and plan to launch exchange this year.
An exchange license, though issued by a central bank does not in itself allow you to speculate with client money. Not unless you launch a fund where your clients are aware of the fact that you are going to be using their money to speculate and they sign off on the potential risks.
As a licensed exchange, you are authorized to hold money temporarily to effect the purchase and sale of currency or goods. There is no authorization to use client money for you own benefit. For that, you would need a deposit taking license. Like a bank.
As well, no deposit should be allowed until such time as the KYC procedure has completed or you run the risk of having accepted what could turn out to be an illegal transaction. And this is heavily penalized by most central banks who are interested in following anti money laundering regulations accepted worldwide.

Ok, so now I am prepping to start an exchange, how do you suggest we earn people's trust? I have secured private insurance for the deposits and will be making it mandatory for accounts with excess bitcoins to be placed in cold storage. Yet I still feel that some type of government protection will be required. Am I wrong?

I would trade you the Apple system hell, even the stereo for shift paddles. You should have mounted a Ferrari automatic with shift paddles in it. Come to think of it, last year I rented a Chrysler 300 in Canada that had shift paddles in it.
I would never drive a stick shift as long as shift paddles are available. I can outshift the best clutch/stick combination and never ever blow a shift.

I think the title is misleading. It is not illegal for a bank to decide not to do business with anyone and shut down your account. This could possibly fall afoul of discrmination laws but it may yet have to be tested.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:04:21
They are showing nothing because they stole the bitcoins themselves. They are keeping them. Plain and simple. I believe they tried their darndest to clean up the mess that started when the US garnished their account back last year, and try as they might, they could not turn it around, so they decided to keep the bitcoins.

This here is the comment that allows people to hate on Coinbase. It's true they have to follow the law, it's true they need to comply, but compliance should start at signup. Better to deny a signup to a user from a prohibited country than to have this kind of shit problem to deal with.
@_date: 2014-07-24 00:06:29
Actually not. I've secured an exchange license which also allows me to deal in commodities and other monetary instruments. Obviously, I am not in the states but Europe. But the bank I am working with has no problems with Bitcoin neither does the central bank.
I'm just wondering how badly you think I need the license and if you have any suggestions on building trust.

In case you didn't notice OP, your bank is signalling you that they want you to fall in line or take your business elsewhere. Banks are very passive aggressive this way. They never come out and tell you what they are thinking, they just send weird signals.

My apologies, you would be correct. I will make an edit to the original comment to reflect the fuckup.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:11:57
It does, but they are still fees. Someone is paying for them. And don't think for a minute that merchants don't pass that cost on to the client. It is very quietly added to the margins.
The point is that bitcoin has to get much more expensive in order for it to be not worth it. Much more than 23 cents for a transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:10:12
Few bitcoins? You mean like 12k? To watch you on screen over skype? Or some webcam site? Really?
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:11:48
Many edits to get this to look right, sorry...
Eating crow, I did some really bad math on the comment below. As pointed out by several users. My apologies for not double checking my own math before putting it into the comment.
As corrected by * 3.74 * 0.025 = 0.0935. So 9 cents for CC.
* 3.74 * 0.04 - 0.1495. Or 15 cents by Paypal.
* 0.23 / 3.74 = 0.6149. Or ~ 6.1% for BTC.
After realizing this, I have to change my opinion to:
Bitcoin does not appear to be the right tool for micropayments. Just as there is a threshhold for any payment where it becomes ridiculously expensive to make a payment, it seems bitcoin has reached its own threshold and is now not worth using for micropayments.
Leaving the old comment for historical funnies...
~~I'm sorry, but $0.23 cents for a $3.74 transaction is still cheap. Let's do some math for shits and giggles.
Credit Card -- 2.50% X+ $3.74 = $0.35
Paypal        -- 4%      X+ $3.74 = $0.60
This is assuming your bank or Paypal doesn't have to make a conversion on the cash. An exchange can be as high as 10% on Paypal or Western Union and I've seen exchanges as high as 5% on my credit card.
So to recap, you think $0.23 is high? You just paid .06% (6/10s of a percent) to run that transaction. There isn't a mainstream system in the world that charges fees that low.~~
@_date: 2016-12-10 09:20:45
Don't get me wrong, I just don't/can't imagine any major banks used to fleecing their clients not taking full advantage of the margins. They have no incentive to pass on savings to their clients, on the contrary, they would most likely pass those savings on to their shareholders instead.
Maybe I'm too jaded with banks, lol.
@_date: 2016-12-10 04:51:52


I stopped reading when I got to this paragraph. AS IF! Yeah, banks are going to adopt a system strictly for its benefits to its clients. Because the transactions are cheaper, they will benefit the clients? Right.

Agreed, but a bridging system must be built if Bitcoin is ever going to go mainstream. Keeping Bitcoin out of the mainstream might be ideal for some, but on the whole, it is going to need to mesh into the present system somehow. Here's hoping that mesh does not wind up blowing it wide open to the watchful eye of the govs.

Chargebacks in Spain a re a pretty big pain in the ass too. Banks go out of their way to make it difficult for you. I guess in a way it discourages you from doing chargebacks, but it hurts the real chargebacks.
Having said that, it doesn't look like they are protecting themselves from chargebacks very well. Any idea what the plan is?
@_date: 2015-08-22 12:31:49
That's impossible to gauge short term. Visa and MC regulations allow 180 days from the date ~~the user FINDS the discrepancy~~ of the transaction. ~~Meaning if you find you've been ripped off 3 months ago, hell, even 6 months ago, you have 180 days from *that date* to file a chargeback.~~
Source; VISA Regulations, I downloaded them, ~~don't remember from where, visa international website?~~
Edit: Added the word "days" to 180, too ambiguous 
**Edit 1: Felt lazy, hate that, so I went and looked. **
Aaaaand it seems I misread, so my original comment was wrong. Page 262
10.4.E.4 Chargeback Time Limits
10.4.E.4.a The Chargeback time limit is calculated from the Processing Date of the disputed Transaction.
10.4.E.4.b Such Chargeback time limit begins on the calendar day following this date.

This happened with Silk Road, earlier with Fulltilt Poker, and other poker and online gambling sites. They seize money that belong to normal users claiming it was illegal proceeds. Screwing their own citizens out of hard earned money and blaming the sites. If a reasonable effort was made to refund, I would see that as OK.

Local trading is the only way to avoid the risk of putting your identity out there. KYC completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin though it is understandable why it is needed. But if I wanted to purchase something, it would totally be easier to do so using my credit card instead of having to go through all the loops and hoops to buy bitcoin online. It is definitely a barrier to entry to bitcoin for millions of people.
With all the KYC needed to transact in bitcoin today. Can anyone tell me what the advantages are for using it? Because let's face it, switching from fiat for the sake of being in the in crowd is not enough.

Sportsbook.com is one of the biggest. They are also very well funded. Delays in payouts more than likely mean that the account they were using got shutdown. This would force them to find another alternative and sometimes that is not easy.

The answer by should be upvoted higher than the price of bitcoins. There is this huge attempt by the whole bitcoin community to dumb this down for people and even though I run a full node myself, and have been playing around with bitcoin for over 2 years, I still have a hard time trying to parse through all the noise to make a decision.
vroom has cleared up a lot of the clouds that were forming because his answer is at the level of fast, adoptive understanding.
Now, if I could find a place that told me if I install BIP148 next to the legacy bitcoind, will the BIP be running on a separate database, or will it be using the same database, and if it is different, how will the two connect?
I have been programming with bitcoind for some time and find it incredibly difficult to locate simple documentation. Everything I read has people trying to turn bitcoind into rocket science. I could, if I tried, understand all of it, but my mind just shuts down when you start talking about Sally and Alice and Bob not cooperating in a three way? What does sex have to do with this?

As usual, figures are always overblown to make things look very serious. I seriously doubt that this one guy could coordinate that much in money laundering. That could very well be the sum of the volume that BTC-e had during those years. 
The US is a very dramatic country. These guys I don't think will disappear, they are reorganizing is my gut feeling. At least I hope so.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:45:50
Money laundering is any activity that includes US dollars that the US doesn't like you doing. So every US dollar that BTC-e has taken in can legally be called money laundering. It simply just could mean that taxes weren't paid on those amounts, which is very hard to prove, which also means that the extradition could fail.
This is just the US trying to disrupt bitcoin, gasp! Very big coincidence that this arrest takes place THE week of the split. Just saying.

@_date: 2017-07-26 17:32:30
Let's not forget though that the US is very aggressive in declaring any activity as a money laundering operation. The only advantage these Russian guys have is that not all countries will extradite them because, for example, money laundering activities in Europe are very well defined, and the attorneys could argue that the US claims are not specific enough and are too all encompassing to merit an extradition.
It will be an interesting case to follow.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:40:42
It really doesn't mean much. Yes, the US can issue an arrest warrant and then the court starts. Very few people are ever actually extradited because the US cannot really prove a violation of law within the jurisdiction where the arrest was made. 
For example, someone who lives in Europe who by US standards committed a crime. That crime has to be a crime as well in Europe in order for the extradition to be valid and executable.
Look at the Kim Dot Com case, it is very similar and yet, the US has failed in their attempt at extradition. They make a lot of noise on the arrest, but when you look at whether the guy has been extradited, most cases fail. But the people only hear about the arrest and assume that the US is strong enough to accomplish these things, not so.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:41:05
It says the arrested used BTC-e to launder. Not that he is any part of BTC-e. If this is the case, then BTC-e has a good chance of coming back online. Or am I reading this incorrectly?
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:01:06
May I ask what the amount of the transaction was?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:23:22
Ok, so what is gained by moving the signatures to the end of the transaction? How does that reduce the size of the transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:31:35
Thank you kind sir.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:15:46
Ok, thanks. Now I get the part about malleability.


~~So in a way, this does reduce the size of the result set the system has to deal with while sending and receiving a transaction?~~
~~If not, how do they deal with the slow transaction times and high fees?~~
Edited twice: Above question and format, please ignore. A little reading answered my own question. Now I understand.
Seriously man, I understand the heat that this line of question raises, but your comments have helped reduce the mystery that exists, at least for me. By reducing it to simple language, again, at least for me. I really appreciate your help here.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:39:25
I honestly don't see what the problem is here. Late October, early November, Bitcoins were around 200US. During November and December they skyrocketed to ridiculous heights. Now they are beginning to right themselves again and of course you are going to have those who jumped on the bandwagon crying about the drop in price.
But did they not look at the historical highs and lows before they jumped in?
There is still nothing wrong with Bitcoin. Only those who wanted to speculate off its back who will have problems.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:17:32
If I may, I'd like to offer a possible scenario for the high minimum. If credit cards are being allowed, then the simple reason is the high rates the banks charge. Anything less than 50 would make the rate too ornery.
If we're talking about wires, or transfers, then you still have the same problem, some banks charge as high as 15$ to receive a wire. A percentage of the amount to a limit. 
I would not be quick to blame the exchange, but the banks they have to use.
Charging fiat price would also be going anlong way towards devaluing the bitcoin in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:39:12
Yes, great and amazing. But it could also put you out of business. Amazon will eventually block sales of their cards to you for fear of running afoul of US regulators who are keen on disabling Bitcoin as a currency.
I would discuss with attorneys now, even before any more publoc talk of it. And if you decide to become the martyr for Bitcoin by following up with court actions, then so be it.
I wish you luck.

Yes, if we are talking about a bank heist, yes, insured. But if they are stored in your mattress, and your mattress is stolen, then gone just the same.
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:46:29
I'm not knowledgeable about Bitcoins, but would like to point out some very obvious comparisons here.
Yes, bitcoins were stolen. And we all most definitely feel for the victims here. I so hate these thieves.
But cash is stolen all the time. Huge robberies have been carried out in cash and people have lost immense amounts of dollars to thieves. No difference.
This lesson is the equivalent of finding out that storing your cash in your mattress is as dangerous as trusting someone with your Bitcoins.
I've been forced to defend Bitcoin several times this week and these are the comparisons I have made. Drug deals have always been done with cash. They now have another way to do them. But the appearance of Bitcoin is not going to make drug deals rise in numbers. So I cannot accept this as a viable argument against the use of Bitcoins.
One noob question though, can these thieves ever be found out? Can they be found? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:54:26
Exactly. I think people are too complacent with the security of bitcoins because we don't yet fully understand the very real dangers. Truth be told, and I include myself, we are mostly very lax with computer security in general. I think that things like this will eventually make us all more conscious of security in general.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:37:56
Wasn't offering an excuse, just a possible scenario. Just in my own experience, if I had a nickel for every time a bank changed the rules on me in my line of work...(high risk processing).
Banks today are very scared. Yes, even foreign ones. They are threatened with losing their USD corresponding aacounts, crippling a large % of their business.
The US is relentless and if you think they are not attempting to choke bitcoin...
