About the "Rain Man" hint... everyone seems to be fixated on his ability to figure out the day of the week a date fell on. But in the movie, Raymond has many other "savant" abilities.
Things Raymond does that might be relevant:
- Knows what day of the week a date fell on. (We got that one).
- Knows the dates of plane crashes (mentions that Qantas has never crashed)
- Can figure out the number of days / hours / minutes / seconds between dates.
- Mentions a baseball player being traded in 1957, has apparently memorized baseball trades.
Other "feats" that are probably unimportant...
- Remembers the number of inches of snow on a date.
- Has memorized the phonebook from "A" to (half of) "G"
- Can count cards at blackjack
- Can do large multiplications and square roots in is head
The Rain Man script is [here]( searching for "date", "19", "hours" and so on may prove useful.

Yup, doesn't help me either.
The problem is not getting more words; it's that there's no way to know if we're making any progress towards the proper solution. 
What would help is any confirmation of the following:
- Is the puzzle self-contained or is an external reference required?
- Are the 67 pairs in order?
- Is looking at it as "67 pairs" even valid?
- Is the method used "universal", ie, could it be used for any 12 words, or is it customized for this particular set (for example, if the 12 words only use 21 different letters, you don't need a full alphabet...)
- Are we searching for 67 letters, or is there an additional step? May be the pairs encode a Base64 string that contains the gzipped 12 words. Seems way too intricate, but who can tell?
- Other than base64, should we be looking for something in hex? Should the numbers and dates be looked at as hex (I've tried and haven't had much success...)
- Is there more than one layer of encoding? I've got ESCAPE out a string at position 28 using vigenere with "BITCOIN" as the key... but with enough operations and contortions, you can get pretty much get any word you want out of the initial data. Give me a 7-letter words related to Rain Man and I'm pretty sure I can give you a string with ESCAPE in it. :)
- Case in point: if you take (number * yymm * mmdd % mmddyy) mod 26, you'll get: KQSEQPIAWUDZZFPCMLTTMASGVKMGGBQTAZYQUNSQSMAEHCARIGYLCBKNSWMOKZWRAPW which has WRAP one position before where you're looking for it... and the rest of the string is garbage, so that's worthless. I've got dozens of those for WRAP and probably hundreds for ESCAPE.
Here's an example of 12 BIP-39 words with various ways of looking at them:

The first column is just a counter for the 12 words. In the second, there's the index (0-based) for the words. Note that I placed ESCAPE in 6th position and it's 0-based index is 616. Then there's a binary representation of 616 and the hex one, 268 (which had me looking for twos in 1968...) The final two sequences are the ASCII characters for the word in decimal and hex. Figuring out *any* of the 2nd to fifth columns is enough to find the solution.
The "Rain Man" hint mostly adds to the confusion... there's too many ways it can be interpreted... is it related to the dates? As in movie release, actor birthdays, academy award dates? Is it something in the story? If its related to the day of the week, then we've got one more factor to consider when trying to find the letters. "Day of the week". Might as well also add "Week in the year"... Or may the hint relates to intervals between dates? In days? Hours? Minutes? Seconds? 67 pairs have 66 intervals. A 2 bits per interval, you get 132bits = exactly the number of bits for 12 words. I'm sure (and really hope) that I'm waaaay overthinking this.
There was another "hint" (sort of) previously; an old message mentions that "some of you where really close" (it's even repeated). But looking at the previous messages (here and on the cipher site directly) there's not much to go by... talks of PMID for journals; trying the yymmdd as hex colors, etc. Again, there are near infinite ways of trying to fit the data somewhere.

This new hint is like a new cipher in itself.
I don't think the BIP39 words included are part of the solution. They're only 41 letters long. Adding "escape" and "wrap" gets us to 51, but we'd need the 2 remaining words to be 8 letters long each. This cannot be made to fit with previous hints, unless the widely held assumption that the 12 words are 67 letters long is wrong.
Also, more BIP39 words are present, if you consider that "gaze run alpha inject thank" are included in "gazette runner alphabet injection thanks"... you could even push it and pretend that "oax" is "oak" and "waist" is "waste". Is "tequila" "alcohol"? 
The 26 words = 26 letters of the alphabet seems promising. Is the method used to get "A" from "step" applicable to dates and numbers? I haven't yet found a way to extract the alphabet from those words in a consistent manner. 
Is the arrangement of words over the 8 lines significant? We have 4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4 words, does that mean something? "Session" is the only word with only one space before it... is *that* significant?
Except for "escape" and "wrap", it seems like every hint is so vague and open to various interpretation as to only makes the cipher harder to crack.

I'm not sold on the "numbers = groups" thing. Not only are there too many of them (14 and not 12), 3 of them are singles (10, 13, 14).
I think the numbers might be involded in letter selection. Their uneven distribution looks a bit like the distribution of letter frequencies in the BIP-39 list. The months also have a similar uneven distribution. 14 numbers + 12 months = 26 possible combinations... If the weekday is involded, then 14  = 2*7, there could also be a relation there.

I'm still trying new stuff everyday. I started late, though.
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:04:31
I'm stuck too. I've been approaching it a bit differently, assuming that each number+date encodes a letter. The 2048 words used by BIP39 range in length from 3 to 8 and have an average length of 5.4 letters. The first (beta) puzzle encodes 11 words in 61 pairs, for an average of 5.5 and this puzzle has 12 words in 67 pairs; avg = 5.6... So assuming that each pair corresponds to a letter (with no spaces between words) seems plausible.
I'm also hoping that the puzzle is self-contained and that the dates do not refer to any external list. The wording of both puzzle offers no suggestion or clue that this might be the case, so I'm assuming that you can solve the puzzle from the cipher only with no additional input.
My main problem now is that there an almost infinite number of ways to map a date and number to the alphabet. Also, is the order of the pairs in the cipher the order of the plaintext? Are the dates used to change the order? The numbers? Both? 
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:17:45
I went through both picture with stegsolve and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:44:19
More thoughts...
The beta puzzle gave the last word (APOLOGY) which wasn't part of the cipher and for this one, there were a few messages indicating that giving the last word would make solving it "easy" (it was posted for only a minute). That would seem to indicate that the lasts words are important in solving those ciphers. Are they maybe part of the key? Also, in both puzzles the word FREE is also capitalized in the text. Is that a hint? I've tried many variations involving both words on both puzzle but got nowhere. (And I'd previously used all 2048 BIP words as possible keys in various tries...)
I've also checked for other strings than just letters. Most of those ideas don't "fit well" with 67 pairs (or 61 in the beta) but I checked anyway. Instead of 12 words, I looked for 12 numbers. In decimal, we have apparently too many pairs (and they don't even up); in binary each line is worth 2 bits, so there are way too many ways to fit them... Base64 and Base58 haven't produced results either. 
I've also redone most of my previous attempts, but this time assuming that each word was individually encoded and then the string was concatenated. Instead of repeating a key over the length of the 67 characters, I'd try to find a word at the beginning, then strip that word from the string and restart the decoding algorithm. The best result I got from that was 3 3-letter words... unlikely to be the correct ones.
As for external data, I noticed that zip codes could look a bit like years-month-dates depending on how you split them, but got nowhere with that too.
Tested with multiple keys (like WRAP and FREE or APOLOGY and FREE), tried with each word encoding with itself before being encoded again with another key (or two)... 
Most of the attempts I made with keys assumed that there was some kind of "vigenere" ciphering done on the letters with the key. I've also experimented with XOR (instead of +/- with modulo) but got mostly a lot of garbage in my strings. There are other ciphers, some involving 2 words for the keys, but the sheer amount of possibilities makes testing them all impractical.
I still have a few more ideas, (like a non-standard ordering of the alphabet. Since the name is "AZbookmakers", I thought maybe they could use the alphabet ordered like AZBYCXDW... ) but at this point I feel those methods are getting so far out, they're very unlikely to be correct.

Yes, but the puzzle was solvable *before* the Rain Man clue. In the old message "one more time : some of you guys were very close..." there hadn't been any mention of the day of week before that (unless I've gotten my message order confused...)
@_date: 2018-10-31 11:38:27
You can get **A** from just about anything you want. With **STEP** you can take the ASCII values and substract them (83 - 84 - 69 - 80) getting -150. Modulo 25 (to get and index from 0 to 25) gives you 0, the index for **A**.
Unfortunately, that works for no other word in that list. Getting a letter from a word can be done in a miriad of ways... getting the alphabet from a series of word using the *same formula*, now that's something else. :)
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:43:49
Yeah, I've got a big-ass 300+ lines script too. Plus a bunch of mini-tools to play around with bits, hex values and the 2048 BIP-39 words... At least I had fun.
I'm leaning towards an external list for dates too, although I'm exploring hex and b64 encodings... those seem to be popular in other BTC puzzles solutions, so maybe it is something simple that we overlooked.
I wish we've just get a clue that addresses that... something like "guys, the puzzle is self-contained..." or "Wow, those hurricanes are  really something this season, right?" (I've already checked hurricane dates and names, and nothing panned out.)
The other avenue I haven't investigated is... well, I'll let you know after I've checked it out. There's some kind of obtuse third hint available. :)
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:58:51
I tried that too, but getting 2 bits from a date and a number (and the ordinal position, and the day of the week, etc.) can be done in a near infinity of ways...
