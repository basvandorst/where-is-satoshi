How do you day trade coins?
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:57:46
Damn this all seems really complicated and it's kinda intimidating..

If that happens go thorough the hard drive, find any personal info and try to contact the original owner. Offer to split it with him.

I'm in it for the long game. The nearest big city to me would be Portland OR. and honestly driving 5 hours so I can get a better rate sounds better. Exchanging silver or gold sounds like a solid plan too. Have you actually exchanged via silver or gold? Where do I buy the correct gold or silver from? I'm sorry for all the questions but I have a lot to learn.

Weren't they $2900 a few days ago?

What's a good secure way to store it so it doesn't get lost/stolen?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:37:30
Do you have recommendation for a good hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:25:41
I believe in the long term investment. Bitcoin will keep going up. The question is should I wait for them to drop slightly again then buy? Or just go all in now?

This post made more sense than any of the others. I think I'll go the ATM route my first time around. After that I'd love to learn how to buy low and sell high to make large sums fast. Where can I learn to do that?

Why buy $500 in increments? Can you explain this?
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:35:36
Roger that. I think I'll buy in increments. What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:10:55
Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I wanted to buy in at $3200 but I can't decide how I should buy :(

I think I'm going to try the in person option before buying gold or silver. I just installed the mycelium app and it has a feature that find people near you that will sell in exchange for cash and the app will arrange the meeting. Have you ever used this method or a similar method?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:56:51
I'm kinda still confused on how to buy. It seems like there's no easy way to buy without bs fees
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:46:16
To me it seems like there's money to be made scouring old hard drives.
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:00:41
Once you found a wallet could you even access the coins?
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:21:57
I live in a small town so find someone locally to sell to me is going to be a tall order.. a lot of what you said went over my head, what's my best option at this point to go all in? I may be able to do 2k.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:11:08
So how would I buy in with it?
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:41:06
Do you control your own key with mycelium?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:40:54
Ahh damn :(
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:38:21
What's a hardware wallet? I only have a smart phone.
