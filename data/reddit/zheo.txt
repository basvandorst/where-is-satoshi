under Step 4 in that link there is a Bitcoin icon
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:56:31
yeah u need to put some of it in something else than online wallet..
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:00:46
you know credit card transactions aren't fully confirmed until like week later right?
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:17:37
Most hodlers don't seem to care if u look at the price.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:14:37
Maybe they are done with the pumping phase now, wouldn't be suprised if Ethereum price started crashing within like week.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:02:33
No, in the end it is the users who have all the power not the miners. If miners make changes no one agrees on then no one will follow their chain what ever the amount of hashingpower they have. 
but miners are still very important part of the community.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:59:42
if you are nervous about losing the money you should probably consider if you have too much bitcoin... and no one really knows how low it will fall.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:07:46
Im not sure if miners really even want to increase blocksize much because they make more money with small blocksize?
Maybe reason BU is crazy is because it is never meant to be activated for real?
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:55:06
no one here knows for sure and anyone who says they do is lying.
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:20:01
Well.. in my opinion its not a good thing that there is disagreements on how to move forward with scaling in the community. Buying bitcoin is always a huge risk and you should never buy more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:28:13
well it is way better idea than BU certainly.. but i would rather see segwit activated first before considering 2mb HF
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:57:35
PoW change sounds like a really huge risk and hopefully wont be needed.. but then again i would love to mine with GPU again.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:43:12
Roger and his miner cabal blocking segwit makes me sad :(
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:09:05
miner centralization is not only due to high cost of power but also about avaiability of mining hardware.
gladly i have "free" energy currently.. though i won't be able to run a huge mining operation with this :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:41:37
for some random smart contract apps it might make sense to use coin that has someone controlling inflation just look at when the current ETH bullrun started... around same time Vitalik talked about monetary policy and reducing miner fees by 3x. 
obviously Ethereum is centralized and should never be used as an investment.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:21:19
most of the slides that actually matter in these repeat the same thing over and over. Talks only about problems in current implementation, no mention of segwit+LN solution from Core side.. 
Basically just says good things about BU leaves out any problems so anyone new into this will think BU is the only and best solution.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:11
considering whether to buy more soon :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:03:44
These are prediction tokens on exchanges.
info on bitfinex one: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:25:44
There is a subreddit with all this info: 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:25:14
This doesn't need segwit, big miners are mentioned as backers in this and they can mine on both chains at same time for more profit, is this why they want to block segwit so LN doesn't bring competetion to it?
Does this have danger to increase centralization even further?
Obviously smart contracts like this are good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:07:05
Well, he is right about the fact that if price goes down enough because of miners standing in the way of progress they might change their mind.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:06:17
this, PoW change means going back to CPU/GPU mining and there is tons of ppl with hardware ready. Hell, even i would start up a miner if that happened.
I dont really support PoW change unless necessary either however.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:33:05
isn't it also big risk for them since if their forked chain fails after all and minority chain changes PoW to protect it self what will they do then?
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:09:10
Now address collision like that will almost certainly never happen to anyone on the planet but that high amount of btc will be quite hard to sell fast without someone finding out who you are.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:26:37
hardfork could happen in future but it is impossible to predict if its better to buy before or after as no one knows how markets will react on prices of each chain. You are just asking people to predict future.
Personally i think hardfork is still quite unlikely.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:47:43
yes, forgot to add i meant under the current implementation.
In my opinion this really shows how bad mining centralization has got if one person can block something 95% of others would agree on.
Also what are the dangers in UASF activation?
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:31:23
haven't heard this before....
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:15:22
Maybe but yet i see there are not many affordable ASIC for sale that could be bought.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:20:16
about 300k btc according to some ppl i have seen post on this sub.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:43:01
yes, they do have choice even if they have 100% of hashing power. They can sell all their coins and go into another alt coin completely, in that case however if enough ppl decide to do it bitcoin will possibly die completely.
What i said doesn't have much to do with how blockchain it self works but of peoples freedom to do what ever they want with their coins.
If 100% of miners decide to do something that they think users want but no one really does it will completely crash their coin price and miner profits. 
also users always have choice to go and create new chain with another client from the point where miners ruined it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:54:43
This is an altcoin bubble that repeats every year around march. Just a warning to anyone into those coins.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:24:05
hmm.. this could potentially be bad for bitcoin in the long run due to politics. hopefully they will decide to go after companies doing this instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:39:10
completely depends which chain the markets trust more. might even end up killing profits for both chains completely.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:32:11
And yet bigger hashing power doesn't matter if users don't use your coin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:08:12
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:36:44
I guess bitcoin volatility has come down quite abit when 0.7% drop is called diving.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:41:24
if your coins are in wallet and you keep them there and do nothing with it and hardfork happens you will end up with same amount of coins on both chains.
 so if you want to you can do nothing and which ever side wins you still have your coins.
this war can however damage the value of btc very badly.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:19:31
he is talking about UASF very likely as 95% is never going to be reached.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:47:05
My guess is that it just can't be going up all the time. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:25:37
Doesn't this mean that segwit will never activate unless Jihan doesn't want it seeing that he controls over that 5%?

would be nice tho as i lost some of my trading coins there.

No, Bitcoin Core isn't funded by AXA. 
a few Bitcoin developers are working in a company was aparently funded by PwC that is owned by AXA.
Are all bitcoin devs supposed to work only on bitcoin it self and for free?
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:10:48
Would BU side even accept this?
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:01:22

@_date: 2018-03-07 18:46:24
the average sell price of mtgox coins was over $10k.. so the title is false. 
Also it looks like price originally started crashing around the same day mtgox coins moved first time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:17:46
bought at $180.. should have waited little longer but what ever :)

so, looks like my Satoshis never arrived.. wondering what went wrong:  
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:16:43
it is realistic if it keeps growing and keeping up with the promises.
it is still risky to invest big amounts of money however.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:42:47
if mining becomes too expensive to be profitable some of those ppl will stop mining until it becomes profitable.  mining difficulty can also drop which makes it profitable again.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:50:42
1.  no, you sell that bitcoin to someone for USD
2.  no, the amount of bitcoins will never be actually reduced but  some of them will get lost over time.
3. it is scarce because of the limit that 21 million will ever be created.

quite low as there are just too many addresses :)

I read his posts at bittiraha.fi forums(finnish bitcoin community), seems like he registered little bit less than year ago with plan to start service buying/selling bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:06:25
paypal would probably do something what Bitpay is already doing, you would be able to use bitcoin possibly in every site where you use paypal.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:37:05
It is not possible.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:13:36
really? :D
well you could slowly sell it, probably the best idea if you want to cash out.. or you could keep it as bitcoin and use it to buy stuff u need.
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:15:37
really wish this would work globally.. :(
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:40:14
yah.. thats quite abit of bitcoins. just hope it isnt fake wall
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:05:37
too many trades so its lagging.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:18:00
yah, not going to believe it until i see it up on amazon my self.
it is just so easy to edit the page to look like that.

i am on windows yes.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:45:39

@_date: 2013-04-26 19:41:48
could this even be done really?

make the calculator difficulty 10x what it is now, that is how much it will probably be once u get your unit.

I would guess it wont, at least for a very long time. Unless maybe if some governments make bitcoin illegal suddenly.

still empty sadly :/
were the addresses i gave out.

uhh... no
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:41:04
you don't need to be miner to own bitcoins. i never mined any my self and i own nearly ~8 right now.
we do need more ways to buy bitcoins however.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:58:25
I like how he calls Krugman a complete bimbo
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:06:54
a lot of merchants use BitPay etc. that completely take risk away from them.
price of bitcoin doesn't really matter, except for the buyer at the time of purchase.
@_date: 2013-10-23 09:06:17
the second number is what percentage of bitcoins will be used for transactions. so 1% you input on that is very small.
my numbers: 
Percentage of the world economy: 0.1%
Percentage used for transactions: 30.00%
Then every single Bitcoin will be worth:
12456 $
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:45:24
i would say its better someone wants to sell a few coins sometimes, it has gone up way too fast and if it continued at this rate we will just have another big crash soon.
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:31:46
who even cares about ripple.......
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:45:39
only for US/Canada :(
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:25:15
yes, also anyone can create new currency abit like USD and Euro so they will be inflated. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:06:42
no there just isnt enough bitcoins for it to be mainstream and low value.
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:23:34
yah, i think there is some problems with deposits that went to the old bank info. hope they will fix it soon for everyone.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:25:50
yes, ban shiat. how big amounts do u need to be moving to get in trouble anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:31:38
probably the reason why i still didn't get mine from the first promotion :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:59:36
Yeah, someone who says bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme doesn't even know what Ponzi Scheme is.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:11:04
would be kind of hard to make holding numbers illegal.. but i guess they can try :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:38:54
time to buy :&gt;
@_date: 2013-10-08 13:29:30
they dont?
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:32:05
the end.. probably not ill be buying soon :)
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:27:50
no one knows really..
@_date: 2013-06-01 14:27:39
Well it seems the btc i purchased with my giveaway XRP arrived at bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:23:59
yah, noticed this last night aswell. wondering who is the buyer :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:50:43
now ofc.....
no one knows.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:33:29
itis certainly not a bad thing. we need big companies like this to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:27:46
Doesn't mean they will close. Even if they did, someone else would make new similar site anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:01:56
you would have to pay insane amount to get all the coins.. you would need pretty much unlimited amount of money to buy all.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:16:02
it will almost certainly crash quite abit now at some point.. but there is no way of knowing how high it will go first really.. could be $1000... $5000... maybe more.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:12:02
it is working just fine.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:17:37
most of them had alot of problems i think, except the smallest ones
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:40:50


if we knew this we would all probably be quite rich.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:12:13
its a troll
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:54:19

does this work, i see steam has it but dont have any bitcoins to try with at this moment.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:37:55
bitstamp can seem quite slow one hour and the next hour there can be insane amount of trades and lag. its really random but it seems to follow mtgox price pretty fast.
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:33:35
actually there are some countries with more than one currency in use.
