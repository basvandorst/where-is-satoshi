Everything is in flow. Quantum computing won‘t appear overnight. I expect that underlying protocol will be improved alongside. As faster as computers are calculating, the potency (and thus  the difficulty) will be increased at the same time. There will be always a balance between rising computer power and encryption on the other side to my humble option.

Good point...
He has now the list, the word is definitely on. 
So, just compare your handwritten word with all potential look-a-likes.

Here is the link to all possible words
As ‘grown’ is not on, it only can be ‘grow’
Or it is ‘group’ and you were not able anymore to decipher the handwriting...

Well, first of all you have to make yourself clear each Bitcoin is in the Bitcoin Blockchain. And if you like to get the only person knowing where your Bitcoins are in the Blockchain, you have to be the owner of the private key (pk). 
With Trezor, of course you have the pk, with the mobile wallet probably if it showed up a recovery phrase (=private key), at exchange Coinbase you will never get the pk as the exchange is storing on behalf of you (and all other customers).

It was a very wise decision by Mike Belshe (one of the the main initiators of SegWit2x) not to try to push it through. He mentioned in his statement ‚it was never he’s idea to set the entire BTC success story on risk’.  
I take my hat off for doing so. 
So the whole community can now step into new discussions to enhance the protocol if needed at all...

All banks in the entire world have to fulfill money laundry regulations. Therefore they must hold on to KYC rules (KYC = Know Your Customer). Therefore money transfer is always based on true identities. 
Of course you maybe find another way, but I am able safely say that would be illegal. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:35:45
Okay. To be more precise: Fiat Money (Bank Transfers) needs to be KYC. Also at exchange‘s end.

Look at this 
I thought, well, it can’t be Satoshi. 
But the painter thinks differently ��

At the end it makes not a big difference. 
Try if you like to do so...
Won’t be a game changer anyhow!
But maybe you develop a good feeling to trade the BTC.

From 5200 to 5800 I count almost 12%. Actually it would make sense. 12% are 12%. 
But it’s just an example. So, probably you want be so smart to sell always higher as you bought earlier. Nobody knows the future. Sometimes you might be right (and win 12%), sometimes you won’t. Taking trading fees into considerations I tend to say you shouldn’t do it, it’s not worth the action. 
Beside the fact you would be able to foresee a huge sell off (crash), but how should you?? Nobody can. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:03:12
From my end a NO!
Your idea is related to retail. And retail clients won’t be the game changer anyhow with regard to higher prices you argue with. 
Asset managers (pension-, hedge- and also retail funds) do not care about mBTC, Satoshi or whatever. They invest in multiples of Bitcoin. 
So I am with you that people have to be educated  Bitcoin is fractional. But they must do by theirselves, otherwise they shouldn’t invest anyhow. Understand your investment is key. 
And furthermore I do not like your argument more (retail) people could buy noting BTC is ‚cheap‘ due to fraction, as at the same time big guys maybe would say I won‘t invest in penny stocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:50:59
Pretty simple answer: you are wrong. The 10 biggest BTC wallets (which is in fact institutional due to the value) contain more Bitcoin as 5millions wallets of retail. 
Furthermore Berkshire is a bad argument. Because BTC is already fractional. 
You only like to change the unit of measurement due to people who are not aware that BTC is fractional. Funny it is!
