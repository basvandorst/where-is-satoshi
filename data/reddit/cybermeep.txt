If yall have twitter, I made a twitter bot that tracks the halvenings! We're a little over 70% of the way there.

Yes, but also whatever thing a malicious user has done on an isolated network wont be compatable with the larger bitcoin network. The malicious user gains nothing and in fact probably loses more because they need to invest in building nodes, mining operation sufficient to perform 51% attacks capable of competing against other malicious entities... it just seems like the costs are too high to actually reap any rewards.

More education and more people involved in bitcoin now. It's definitely an important event. My guess is volatility will smooth out with each halving as the wider market learns the cadence of bitcoin.

It's where all the meat walks around
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:08:42
its not necessarily better or worse, just different. see their [FAQ](

There's a twitter bot for anyone who's interested in tracking the halvening 
It posts an update every percent closer to the halvening

I'm really, really curious to know why they decided not to implement send/receive in their app. Was it SEC related? AML? Is it because it would detract from the apps other features? So many questions about their decision.

Lol I got a similar email because I labeled a payment for rent as "The Base". They must have thought I was constructing a military base...

Its tangentally related...

how come someone hasn't built a simulator that lets you adjusts parameters such as block size and see the resulting effects? Seems like a good way to finally put this block size debate to rest. Quick, someone build a quantum computer!

Hold on, i think you might actually identify as a SJW simply by making that claim
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:09:54

ideally the combined hashpower of these 4 pools should be less than 51%. I think overtime we will see more adoption of [P2Pool]( , as this removes the middleman of pool operators and would make it much more difficult for groups to collude and achieve a successful attack.

Does anyone know how energy consumption was calculated? Is it based entirely on hash power?
@_date: 2019-02-07 05:27:59
its how much of a lead the coin has over the next lowest coin. so bitcoin has an 81% lead over XRP. XRP has an 8% lead over Eth.
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:44:06
energy consumption, environmental impact of mining perhaps
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:30:10
One day I will be like you!

To your second point that mining isn't an efficient way to get heat in the first place, consider that CPU's are actually 100% efficient at converting electricity into heat. All of the power being used by the ASIC, the fans, the vibrations, the lights eventually becomes heat.

Its the algorithms, man. The AI is taking natural selections place.

Bad money drives out good money. Fiat will continue to exist, it will just be increasingly worthless compared to bitcoin as banks and government endlessly inflate and debase their currencies by creating it out of thin air. People will continue to give away their worthless fiat while hoarding their valuable bitcoin. Bitcoin is valuable because it has real use cases (censorship resistant messaging, trustless ledger, practically impossible to counterfiet) it requires energy to produce, and there is a predictable and steady flow of new bitcoin. This is why bitcoin price will sky rocket.

according to what metrics and in what dimensions? how are you coming to your conclusion? Bitcoin, in some dimensions is infinitely better than fiat currencies - for instance an immutable public ledger and controlled supply are both great features of bitcoin that fiat currencies lack. In other dimensions, other payment networks such as VISA excel at providing fast, high volume, and cheap transaction throughput. At the same time, VISA transactions can be denied for any reason while every single Bitcoin transaction is treated as equally valid (unless of course it is an attempted double spend).

Depending on how it catches on with Twitter, I may consider building a little widget. Might be a fun weekend project!

Maybe this will convince all the luddites who still own cable to finally buy some Bitcoin

According to Leonard susskind, Quantum computers can really only be used efficiently for solving quantum problems. cryptography not being a quantum problem, a quantum computer should not be able to perform any better than a classical computer. So it should be a non issue.

They allow you to withdraw if youd like to which i recently discovered though they require KYC. Personally I bought a couple opendime USB sticks as those are far better than putting the key on a piece of paper. Cash app no fee trades is certainly a very attractive feature for sure! I'm thinking about switching from coinbase to cash app myself.

He nakes the claim that before the internet we lived in a world with singular truths and singular authorities and then claims that internet has fragmented society into many communities. Which it's somewhat true... it has also united the world in a way never before possible. The world was probably much more fragmented before the internet. There were so many unknowns and so many cults and small subcultures isolated from one another pre internet. Now, there are practically no unknowns. The internet is not rebellious at all, its completely, absolutely, singularly unifying.

Bitcoin originated in the US so it kind of makes sense that the US would dominate the market.
