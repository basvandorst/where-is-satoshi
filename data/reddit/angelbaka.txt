Today is a good day for you.

My credit union doesn't have that restriction. Must be a bank thing.

But I wanna buy soda with Bitcoin.

Stop bitching, make some money and manipulate back.

7 millisecond is a long time in a computer controlled industry.

He's also missing several conjunctions. His statement is much more steam of consciousness with a period at the end than a run on  sentence.

I don't think gox has been a leading exchange for a long time. As far as I'm aware, the only reason people had money in gox still was convenience, ignorance, our bad timing/luck. Gox has been in the exchange shit list for a long time now. The only reason they are/were important is because they were the first big, relatively trusted, professional exchange - they broke ground that let people like coinbase get the investors they needed to set up shop.

....  That didn't make sense to me. 
Am I missing a meme somewhere?
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:23:06
Since when?

A little...?

People who might benefit from Bitcoin. And people who wouldn't. Who cares?  More correct information can only be beneficial to Bitcoin.

No, I own a bartender.

Nah. This feels much closer to the Aaron Schwartz effect than am anti-coin thing.

Mine's cheaper than a Starbucks barista. Awesomely obedient. Only issue is her boyfriend and he got kicked out last time he tried to start a fight with me. She's a little sore about it still but it'll get better with time.

I usually say "fucking a." But I think it's a bit of a regional thing.

...this is quite possibly the dumbest thing I've seen this month.

Not quite - the entire system is built off *representative* wealth, also known as promissory notes, also known as debt. A dollar bill represents the idea that the government owes you one dollar's worth of [insert here].  With big banks (or, really, big ANYTHING), the scale starts to get sorta dumb. Additionally, static money isn't making more money. So when you have huge amounts of value like this, you start loaning and moving it around and doing silly things with it because every transaction generates profit on some scale. Banks are tied together in massive chains and loops of interconnected debt that allow them to both profitably represent the full balance of find they "possess" while they still have available a fraction to perform their "primary" function of making your money available to you. 
Tl;dr: "money" is really "debt", and you can do a lot of fun things with it.  
Edit: oh, wait, you're a troll. Damnit.

All the goddamn time?

Just pay the equivalent at time of sale in dollars.  It's all representational anyway, as long as you're giving correct value, it doesn't particularly matter what format it's in.

Actually, it's much more likely we either already had an armed burglar or he pawned the gun almost immediately. The differences in consequences as far as the law goes are such that it's actually something most thieves think about.

The problem with the exchanges is not getting cash out, it's getting cash in.

Actually, MMOs were exactly what I was thinking of when I heard Decentralized Exchange.  Why could we not do an auction-house type p2p exchange system?

Hey, trading mtg cards is a very profitable enterprise. And magic nerds are only slightly less bitchy than we are.

Now you're starting to get into the philosophy behind the idea that information is free. Sure, you own the physical bits that represent your copy of the block chain, and theoretically have full control over exactly what can be done to those bits (although in practical application, you've loaned out or given up most of them in exchange for convenience or the ability to actually use and present those bits in a way that conveys meaningful information to you) but do you actually own a copy of the blockchain itself? Very debatable. 
As an interesting aside, this is a different face of the same problem we have with software patents.

Actually, DoHS would be mostly controlled and directed be the executive branch as the branch that regulates enforcement. Therefore, this one would be Obama.

I imagine silk road could give you a decent answer. And that varies from pawn shop to pawn shop. I imagine a career burglar knows which shops don't ask questions. 
Or hell, maybe he gave it to is his bank robber buddy as a birthday present.  Dunno. My point was that it's much less likely that he kept it unless he already had (a) gun(s) in his possession. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:43:24
I'm sure he doesn't. But DoHS is (currently) part of his administration.

No conformation, didn't happen.

More likely so that the banking superstructure doesnt collapse as quickly.

As an american, Fahrenheit sucks balls. We as a society are just too fucking stupid to change over.  Same with metric.
