Thank you! That will be my project tonight. Put them on my ledger. Now you mentioned what to do after the split? What CAN happen? This all really, really new to me. Can something good happen?

Ah ha!!! That’s why it went up! Wow. It’s all coming together now. 
Was Bitcoin Cash a result of a previous fork? 
Now I need to to figure out how to post a link directly to that comment so you can get the credit you truly deserve. Really. Thank you very much.

Thanks to you both for your help. To keep it simple can I give you both an option to choose from so I can do this correctly?  I just want to do whatever it is that is more advantageous for the little bitcoin that I do have.  
Option A : keep on coinbase for the week
Option B:  transfer to Nano tonight
If I was your poor and uninformed Grandmother who had a small amount of bitcoin what would you tell her to do with it this weekend? Option A or B?  
Thanks again guys.

Awesome! Thanks for the input. I look forward to putting into my wallet tonight. I still have no clue what this fork is but is it something that can be a good thing?

Noob here. What do I need to do with the bitcoin I have on coinbase. Do I need to do something before the fork? I bought a nano ledger. I haven’t opened it yet. I plan on doing that tonight. Thank you!

I guess because this is all so new to me let me ask you what you are doing with your bitcoin before this fork? I keep hearing people talking about getting free coins after this fork if you “do it” correctly?  No idea what this means. So I’m going to do whatever you do since you’re “smarter”. ��

Holy smokes! It finally makes sense to me. Thank you sooo much. You should post this in here somewhere for everyone to read. I promise you would be helping a lot of people. 
Since this fork is happening why doesn’t everybody just load up and buy all they can since they’re getting a 2 for 1?
Thank you.
