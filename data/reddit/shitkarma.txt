That's not association, Bitcoin can only flourish in another reality where there is no governments and no countries... because no nation will allow a parallel monetary system interfering with their economy.
Also, which I believe the deeper and ulterior reason for the adoption of the Libertarian ideology by bitcoiners, is the promise of Inheritance of the World Economy by the Bitcoin Early Adopters, a joke that many here play inside their minds, it is a thought that is only morally right under the Libertarian mindset.

At the very least, it is a proof that the financial system is about the trust on the institutions that deal the commodity than the commodity itself. If all exchanges behave like Gox did, the bitcoin's value will be pennies.

Totally possible? Why stop at $50 then? We should be putting all money on bitcoin! Everything!

If you truly believe that bitcoin is apolitical, you are being used. Every place you put your money, every time you buy a product, each moment you pay your taxes, is a political act, even when it is shielded by a PR machine like a Coca Cola bottle. 
When you put money into bitcoin, you are financing a system created to circumvent governments, and this is central in the agenda of many ideologies that I find personally not only obtuse and simplistic, but total opposite from what I believe of a transparent, representative, generous and meritocratic society.

yeah, but remember, wikipedia cannot do more than 7 pageviews per second... wait

what? aren't most (if not all) of the bitcoiners libertarians or am I missing something? You can't separate one thing from another, you can't separate monetary system from its ideology, it is the nature of it.

Yeah, I can imagine the Bitcointopia, a dude that bought his bitcoins in 2009 owns half of Europe. It is so better than a fucked up world that you have to work to own something...

You are from a new wave of thought of r/bitcoin saying this out-loud, stating that bitcoin has *no ideology*. It is fascinating this divorce between bitcoin and its core primordial values. 
Perhaps you are right, and those loony ideologies were never really believed in this community, **in reality people here just want to get rich with bitcoin**, and if the old glory ideology is harming this objective by giving bitcoiners a bad rap to potential lenders, they'll not think twice of getting rid of libertarian views and state that bitcoin is now apolitical.  
At least it is a good sign that the principles of 'unregulated-free-market-to-govern-us-all-and-fuck-you-poor-people-with-your-entitlements' is becoming a moribund belief that is being avoided even here.

Really guys, it is (was) 250,000 dollars. Why did you expect they would print him preaching bitcoin? under the circumstances it would be anecdotal.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:35:59
Tell me the truth, you came to understand that the core values of the bitcoin community are toxic, but sweeping it under the carpet won't make them go away.

That's the big elephant in the room. Banks do not exist only to make transactions, but also for safety. There are a lot of people that were exposed by the mtgox leaks, some with thousands of bitcoins, these people now live in fear.

I'm not sure why US would do this, but obviously they would first exploit a flaw in the system, there is always one. It doesn't need to be a single blow, most probably they would exploit it to hit credibility and the faith over bitcoin over time. Resourceful as they are, they probably already have something close to this. The major military application for computer science is to break cryptographic systems, even before Rome there were ciphers and ciphers were broke. I mean, the fucking company that created public-key cryptography have secret deals with the US government. Cryptography is a government specialty, no private institution can top them in this regard, and bitcoin is cryptography.
Besides all these shady deals with money laundry and black market, we have all these loonies in the bitcoin community preaching to bring down governments, obviously that bitcoin have their attention.

You are forgetting those who find bitcoin and its libertarians views to be evil. They are the true antagonists

What you are defending is to kill the patient to cure the disease. 
The problem is at the top, not the bottom. We do attend multiple conflicting interests when we pay our taxes, its perversity is that this same money that finances wars also finances education, to asphyxiate one will asphyxiate another. 
Now, I was talking about anarchists and libertarians beliefs, they are obtuse and simplistic because they believe that a game can work without rules, that an important soccer match can exist without referees, that F1 regulations block competitiveness and technical evolution of cars... while is the inverse, the laws of the game are there exactly to maintain the competition, to the keep the game fair. That's what governments should be doing.
Without rules and penalties, there would be no Market, much less free, there would only be a grey goo monopoly chemically addicting everyone by force, and that's where unsupervised greed would lead us.

do you know what sovereignty means?
