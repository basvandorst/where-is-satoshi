Bitcoin is backed by fried chicken! I'm literally crying.

Not really if you take into consideration how long it took people to figure out wtf this actually is. For the longest time people thought you were a drug dealer if you just mentioned the word "Bitcoin"

If you're looking to invest long term then yes I do believe so. I guess it comes down to if you believe in Bitcoin or not. I personally believe Bitcoin is the future. If I had $1 million to invest and I had to choose between gold and Bitcoin I'd chose Bitcoin.

Something to think about. Banks have proven time and time again that they're untrustworthy. Don't be distracted by fake news and market swings. Bitcoin, despite a few challenges, is one of the safest investments you can make if you're looking long term.

Why would anyone keep a large amount of money with any exchange? Chances are these guys have no fucking idea what they're actually doing, they can't even keep their exchange from crashing every other hour so why the fuck would you trust them to hold your money?? If you don't have a hard wallet by now then you're either very stupid or very brave...

Anyone got any thoughts on this crazy rise in price over the last 24 hours? I just saw btc drop from $19,304.94 to $16,539.20 in less than 5 minutes. As of now it's at $15,274.99...

Lol. This is a great time to buy more. It's obvious that Satoshi Nakamoto sold all his coins today so now the rest of us can get some....

How far away are we from being able to use this for real, and what would this mean? Would the fees and transaction times go down?
