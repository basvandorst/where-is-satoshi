Oh and all you have to do is buy a steel core door and 28 dollar stopper and the door will not come down. Surely though, if they were coming, they wouldn't tip you off with a letter. What threw me off was the drug reference. If not for that I would of chucked the letter in the trash. I'm gonna write them and tell them id like the 20 bucks back. And request overnight shipping? Lol

not a matter of being lazy, but surely you would want at least a little information on why DOJ is sending you letters? I cant even find a search result matching a seizure on that date, but case numbers seem legit and postmark was out of DEA headquarters....

I've seen some pretty legit looking scams, this is pretty legit if you ask me. There's no way for them to benefit if it was a scam? By filing a letter with office of legal affairs of DEA? They aren't asking for money or Bitcoin. Im 99% sure it's not a scam.

I am one of a great many that got this letter, and it never said i couldnt disclose it. If they give me such limited info, they should expect i'm gonna research it to learn more.

yes, his name is listed, not a company...

Great questions... Can you check if your format was like mine? Showing same bank and total seized amounts?

I think maybe they just found an account of his and seized it to help repay all the people that got burnt? thats speculation on my part, but ive found his twitter, facebook, and other links to companies he owns/operates, and he doesnt seem to be the least bit concerned by it, not a mention of it in any of his twitter updates, including on the day of supposed seizure. I even emailed him for comment, but got no reply...

was notified via certified letter through USPS, signature required. And either billing address for ACH deposit was used, or maybe scan of license was required for purchase? were talking years ago i bought bitcoin and i dont remember different requirements for diff vendors. What struck me odd is the research i found showed they were hacked and shut down 2013, yet my letter shows they seized 53k from him 1/21/16, and they dont say why. They just said, hey we took 53k from someone, and 23 bucks is yours, heres the steps to either have your name cleared, get a refund, or fight it? I dont want the money, but i dont want my name tied into whatever forfeiture they did of his.  A letter from the DEA is not a typical day for me ;) Its a first and worrisome. Im not worried about them coming to my house, i would of almost preferred it so i could ask questions. Its more of a WTF right now, if i used it i would of gotten my coins and been on my way....uploading pics of letter now, pardon the redaction, couldnt find scissors :(

there were a very many exchanges running at the time of bitfloor operation, simply being an exchange or purchasing bitcoin does not make you a violator of "the Controlled Substances Act" as the letter claims. Amazon, paypal, and a pile of other merchants accept bitcoin.
