I think it would strengthen arguments supporting decentralization, which could help crypto.  That being said, this is a logical thought...logic doesn’t seem to matter in the crypto world.

Also, take a look at Internal Revenue Code 1031, which was closed under the Trump Tax Plan but still relevant for all trades made prior to 2018.  I’m no expert by any means, but there is an argument that using this code you can defer taxes from trading similar assets for one year so you ultimately pay based off of an amount at a later date.  That means that you don’t have to worry about any of 2017’s trades until you cash out your final amount, then you pay based on that amount.

If you don’t withdraw money how will they even know?  It could be years before exchanges begin reporting all their users transaction data and then the IRS would have to sift through the data which could take significant time.

Don’t worry, if it gets near zero I promise you that I will personally provide enough processing power to keep it alive.

We should create the “Bitcoin Defense Fund” so that we can “defend” ourselves from threats to the price and stability of Bitcoin.

The IRS will spend 1000x that amount trying to catch you and collect.
Jk, maybe put aside some money just in case.

I would be interested in getting some more information about this opportunity.  Could you PM me?
