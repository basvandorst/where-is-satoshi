I am not bullish on Bitcoin taking over all fiat, it will never happen.  But I DO think that the coming bubble will be at bursting point AFTER the ETF's, hedge funds, and wall street get their money in.  When they do that, I'm out.  I expect that to be around the 1 trillion market cap for all crypto.  Goals.

Not to mention USAA is limited to armed services govt workers... Not many customers compared to a major broker like Fidelity or Vanguard.

Yeah I know.  More nodes and less miner centralization is better.

What is the name of the Fund and where can I buy?  As soon as ETF's become available, anybody with a brokerage account can buy into the ecosystem.  That's going to be a huge money faucet that's going to fill up Bitcoin like an ocean.

Why would you use Bitcoin to buy a coffee?  Are you just trying to make a point?  
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:15:16
Hardforks are cool.  I like em.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:47:53
That's not true.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:15:43
It's definitely going to pop EVENTUALLY.  And I'm going to make SURE I get my money out before it does.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:41:46
That fund is not available to me in the USA.

Most people dont care about privacy.  Why would they?  I'd rather be able to go back and check any transaction any time, and follow the path of my money.  I think most people are the same.  Some dedicated few that need the anonymity will use Monero, but the vast number of people won't.  And I care about the vast numbers...

It's Tilt Shift.  It's not fake blur.  Tilt shift lenses make things look miniature.  You can see good examples if you google.

Not Ponzi scheme.

LOL you are so wrong there buddy.  Owning home has proven to be an excellent way to gain wealth for me.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:52:08
Doh.  This moron and his NY corporate cronies.  
Ironic.

You have excluded YOURSELF from a select group of people with your comment.  The SMART people.

I don't agree with him, but dude's a winner.  You are shortsighted to cal him an "idiot."
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:19:15
I'll enjoy lining my pockets with your money!  
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:30:20
White paper.  LOL.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:49:44
That is what I meant lol.  I sold mine long ago too! 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:52:11
Sold mine at $500 and put into BTC and Lisk!  
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:22:26
BCH is about to be dead to you too... 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:41:03
I think you misunderstand how block chain works... "accumulated proof of work" is the same as "most transactions."  The miners don't decide how many transactions occur, they just process them when they do.  Unfortunately for the miners, it's up to the USERS which chain goes forward as BTC, which you will see shortly.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:13:41
If you think the chain can carry a heavier weight with far fewer transactions... I can't help you, sorry.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:55:13
No, it's about what USERS continue to use as Bitcoin.  Every exchange on earth uses BTC as the reserve crypto.  So those transactions alone are going to create a chain weight bigger than B2X.  There is literally no way the B2X chain will end up bigger.  The miners will switch to whichever is used more.  BTC.  It's pretty simple to understand.  It literally DOESN'T MATTER what the miners do!  
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:58:51
It's OVER.

You are about to HODL your way to being broke.  But somebody has to lose for me to profit, might as well be you!  Thanks!  
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:35:30
Why?  The USD wallet is a registered bank account, subject to FDIC insurance.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:51:11
Ledger is going to support both.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:50:44
I like your style.

Overall market cap is very important to the adoption of the coin.
