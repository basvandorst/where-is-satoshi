The strategy is called "stacking the order book" with buy orders that increase in volume at lower prices so that you automatically get a lower cost average as the price dives into support.

Buy on a buy signal. and don't encourage people to buy and hodl on a Sell signal. Its like telling somebody to sit on a chair and pulling it out from under them.  If your mother asked me if she should buy some Bitcoin I would say certainly but i strongly encourage you to strategically enter the market because it is considered risky and overbought right now. And maybe I would tell her about order book stacking which lowers your average cost basis and is a more responsible way to enter any market. I would tell hitler to buy bitcoin at the top of a spike so I could sell it to him and stack the order book with buy orders at lower prices.

it really isn't like astrology. there are natural cycles and fractal patterns just like in nature and emotional cylces. 9/10 people loose money trading. they are where the profit comes from. My mom was buying around 200, 300, 400 range  (and one at around 600 on the way down ouch)

You have to get burned I did all the time you have to learn from it and or give up. everybody gets burned it takes dedication and discipline and I'm definetly do not consider myself any kind of a trader. I have just been interested for a long time and learn. it is like a hobby. I would like to be better.

Your chances of quickly loosing %10 to %20 are when you buy at the top of a parabolic movement. Say if it increases %50 in a month you are really maximizing your risk. sudden higher prices require more power more money to sustain. when a price is low your money has more buying power to support the price. that is how it works.
