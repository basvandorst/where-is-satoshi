That's a bit of a reach to say people are losing confidence because they are moving to altcoins... I think it's probably more likely that they are trying to invest in higher return coins since the prices are considerably lower than bitcoin. Take ethereum for example, which is up quite a bit more (in terms of percent) than bitcoin this year. Keep in mind that at this point, basically all cryptos are speculative investment vehicles and we're currently seeing a large mainstream investment due to the news/hype and not because of any relevant technical merit.
It could definitely be argued that txn fees could be driving people away, but I doubt even that since bcash has been losing ground (in terms of market cap percentage of cryptos) and it has only partially full blocks.

Microprocessors in the 1990s were also quite simple. How dare they ruin them by designing ever more complex and powerful devices. Damn this modern era of computing! When people want more features and more powerful software, the underlying structures need to become more complex to allow this upward expansion. I agree with you that the core of Bitcoin and its incentive structure should remain mostly unchanged, but making software more complicated isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Lmfao. I just realized I've been a full node for something like 6 years now because there weren't many un-full node alternatives back in the day and I never knew about those options.

By downvoting his post and moving on since it also doesn't add to the discussion. Also, he didn't request anything from you, but rather from the commenter he replied to.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:00:34
Upvoted because I understood exactly what you were going for there! Now that we have this sorted out, have a great day!

Some people honestly do not know that light years are a measurement of distance. As a member of our society (AKA a human being), I think it's incredibly important for our society as a whole to have a higher level of understanding in a broad range of topics. In fact, one of the reasons I use Reddit is to pass on my knowledge of subjects I understand while absorbing knowledge from others in subjects I don't.
To avoid this confusion in the future, either use /s to indicate your sarcasm (an otherwise difficult concept to convey via text), or simply don't post useless jokes which add nothing to the discussion.

It's literally the same people in every thread shouting the same nonsense and ignoring logical responses then resorting to ad hominem and other logical fallacies when they have no real response. I'm definitely not regretting having unsubscribed.

Light years are a unit of distance, not time.

There's a approximately 3,000 transactions in the mempool right now (will vary based on transaction acceptance settings). I would hardly call 1-2 block confirmations "hard to use."
I understand that number can, and does, grow depending upon network traffic, time of day, day of the week, etc. but I hardly think we've reached the point where we need to do something irrational to "scale" like BU. If we activate segwit, we will already have bought more time to find a very strong scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:22:08
That's not really a good measure of anything. Don't get me wrong, I'm running a full node signaling segwit (updated to 14.0 yesterday), but what you stated implies that the only people in the world who can do competent work are those who have already done competent work before. This in itself is a circular argument which is clearly not true.

I see you read the bottom of the comment but not the top...

No, but it could AFFECT the value.

Holy shit, that's Pepper Potts! She runs Stark Industries. This can only be good for Bitcoin.

It's done through bitpay, if I recall correctly. They don't have to manage anything more than they do for accepting other payment methods like PayPal our credit cards.

What app is that? Does it offer other coins than BTC, ETH and LTC?

I don't have any of their products, but I am seriously thinking about it now. This is a fantastic and open way to deal with an issue like a breach and definitely says a lot about how the company is run.
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:47:13
Agreed. If buying to trade, you basically need to keep them online or in a hot wallet. If buying for the long game, put those bad boys in a good storage wallet.

As of May 25, 83.28% of hash power agreed to immediately activate Segwit at an 80% threshold.
Today is May 29th. Where is Segwit? NY agreement my ass.

A team of people solving problems together doesn't mean they always agree with one another. The hope is that cooler heads prevail and comprises can be reached *when it's allowable*. I subscribe to the bitcoin dev mailing list and you're right, not everyone gets along. But, they are fairly respectful towards each other and actively present and discuss solutions.

You probably don't run a full node, do you? The blockchain already grows at ~144MB/day. What happens after your 4MB HF when the mempool starts to grow again? Do we just HF to 16MB and have 4x the capacity again? Meanwhile my full node will just be quietly adding almost 2.5GB/day to the harddrive. Surely you realize simply increasing the block size isn't a viable option. It may have been when CMOS technology scaling was in full force and well aligned with Moore's law, but I have some bad news... It's not going to happen forever. Even if we switched to crazy high density NAND flash drives for all storage purposes, companies like Micron and Samsung have already reached 20nm and smaller nodes. In case you don't know much about semiconductors or solid state physics, we're not getting much smaller anytime soon.
Also, you mention below that a HF to 2MB is "perfectly safe," and supposedly backed by many developers. Clearly you don't follow the dev mailing list very closely. Most of the devs don't think 6 months is a long enough timeline to properly develop and testnet the code for this HF, and a lot of the devs also don't believe a blocksize increase is even necessary when they have already developed, tested, AND released an alternative scaling solution.
Edit: I can't believe I almost forgot... Unless you can come out with proof that you are Satoshi himself, don't try to pull the "original intention for bitcoin" card out.

You couldn't be more wrong. It's actually on the steam support page. They can revoke games from your account for non-payment on a gifted game. Source: Had it happen to my account after making a purchase with bitcoin for a gifted game.

Halving occurs so the rate of production of new bitcoins will eventually reach zero (to a large enough number of decimal places). It's to stop inflation.
@_date: 2016-07-27 21:15:58
This of course!

I'm not trying to argue in either direction, but since you provided the confirmed txns, I'll provide the raw txns:

Depending upon your decreasing scheme, you could integrate the two and find the total released by a certain block number. It would be interesting to see, but I agree it would be a fair amount slower using a constant decrease in reward.

Yeah I get that. I was asking for possible mechanisms to do so.

Well I wasn't there so I have no idea what actually took place. It's 2017 though. Is paper the only way to create a contract these days...? I also took no stance in what I said. I simply provided facts.

I'd say using these cards for ETH mining is fairly common.

How would they go about mining these empty blocks? By setting a ridiculously high fee threshold or something similar?

Hold your horses. Lukejr is one of the only core devs who stands behind BIP148. Don't use his behavior to categorically attack the core devs when most of them actively discuss how bad of an idea BIP148 is. They've even gone so far to say they will not be merging with the core repository. Don't spread bullshit like this around because it's the same political maneuvering you claim to hate.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:04:26
Looking though that table, I wouldn't really say that. Five of you truly support while the rest are just OK with it, directly oppose it, or haven't given support in either direction. I generally use the word "most" to mean a majority. That's not the case here, but I won't continue to argue over semantics. I think it's obvious from the fact that BIP148 isn't being merged that majority support doesn't exist at this time.

This is the Barry Silbert/NY agreement he is referring to. Collectively something like 83.xx% of network hash power signed.
