They're educating each other on what lambos to buy when the price goes up again

It is an objective declaration - it's far too confusing and risky for average investors, and offers no good reason for people to switch off of existing fiat solutions.  Right now, grandma gets her money back when fraudsters compromise her bank details.  How will you explain to her that she should switch to a different system where the fraud is irreversible, not to mention the transactions are slow and expensive?  But hey grandma, at least you're sticking it to the man by not using fiat

Hey, your loss man.  I just bought the dip and went all-in on cat turd futures.  Should be going up in value any moment now

Yeah that's very reassuring.  Tell that to the people who bought at 16K

If someone bought at 9K, on the way up last year (ATH at the time), they could have got out and doubled their money.  Everyone was gambling.  Some people made out like bandits, and a lot of people got burned.  The price is declining for one reason - people don't want it anymore.  It was a speculative bubble, where people got in to try and get rich, and then the hype fizzled out.  Drama within the BCH community has nothing to do with that fact.  If people want to take their chances and "HODL" rather than cutting their losses, there's a fairly good chance they're just going to lose their money.
