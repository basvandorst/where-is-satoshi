Thanks for the response. Would it be safe to move the coins to my wallet now? I am a bit worried about the transaction going unconfirmed.

Would the better option just be to send them to mycelium on my android phone?

And again it should be ok to send my coins today? For the transaction fee, what would be a sufficient sat/b rate? Currently on blockchain.info for priority it is 196 s/b, should I increase it to make sure it goes through? Again thank you for all your help.

Thanks for the response. I ended up just moving my coins to mycelium, I wasn't sure and I didnt want to take a chance. Thanks again for your help.

Cool. One last question, the first 12 word passphrase I received (before I sent the coins) from mycelium is my private key correct? Why does it say two private keys, do I need to know both?

Thanks for the response! I have a question regarding blockchain.info that hopefully you can answer. Currently it says "imported addresses are not backed up by your recovery phase. Transfer into a wallet to secure funds." Under imported addresses it shows my address and amount of coins, should I transfer it the wallet option on blockchain.info? Thanks again!

Thanks. So before I sent the coins I got my 12 word passphrase and it added a private key to mycelium. After I sent the coins from blockchain.info to mycelium it now says there are 2 private keys? Also the address under account 1 is now different, is this normal?
