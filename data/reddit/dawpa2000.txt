You need to be very careful when you are typing an address. You should double check everything and make sure it is your valid address with the correct history on block explorer. Are you sure you are not getting confused with letter "L" or number "1"?

If you had a seasoned EFT setup with a good bank in the US, you only need to make a couple clicks on the website, and ACH will only take 1 business day with no fees. Normal ACH with worse banks is usually 3 days.
Also, if you time the transfer at the right time between business days in the early morning hours, you can complete the ACH transfer within several hours before noon. I have done this before with Santander Bank in the US.

Hypothetically. The TON (Telegram Open Network) whitepaper describes a multi-blockchain network consisting of "blockchains of blockchains", whereby up to 2^32 workchains coordinate with the masterchain (p. 5). The workchains are also subdivided into up to 2^60 shardchains.
The TON whitepaper also describes BitShares, EOS, PolkaDot, and Cosmos as "multichain" projects (p. 74), though I don't know if they are.
