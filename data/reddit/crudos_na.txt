I'm new, don't post much, but keep on reading and learning here. Getting better on being able to decipher fact from bs regarding BTC.

Lambo dealer on speed-dial.
@_date: 2018-05-03 12:52:37
Lambos nearly gassed up.
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:48:30
Good day to you sir!
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:05:57
Don't forget the white hats! Hats off to them!
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:46:30
Yacht powered by 1 million lambos engines. Yeah budddeee!
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:33:04
Red lambo or black lambo?
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:44:08
In lambo we trust.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:10:16
Then add crypto miners to all Lambos..... so much winning.

If, when I retire someday, I can take my wife on a nice date from cashing in my bitcoins, then I will be rich.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:33:10
I'm a noob at bitcoin, and have none yet, but find it a fascinating development. Happy birthday!
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:41:16


Thank sir, may I have another dirt sandwich?

Step 1 - Accumulate
Step 2 - Hodl

Can't, no gas for lambo.

In awe at the size of this LN. Absolute unit.

Spent all money on BTC, no moon gas for me.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:23:50
no lambo? mep.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:37:47
But he got no head!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:37:20


Unless you're into that sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:56:51
Paid too much BTC for pizza.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:57:50
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:16:13
14k wall holding.... for now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:03:25
Buy more bitcoin? The answer is always, 'YES'.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:37
Someone should stream this on Twitch. Getting into a game with Shroud 1v1'ing him is nothing compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:52:17

Well paid, well paid.

Coinbase Pro chart looks like Xmas, with all the pretty orange/green lights.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:07:35
Can now buy a Lambo hood ornament again! Whole car coming soon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:11:33
Actually had to use all my BTC (just factional amounts, but nonetheless) to survive the last two months. So starting over at $9700 is a bit disheartening.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:38:54
Alright did everyone flush at the same time?

I was getting excited, then remembered what I paid for most of my current btc stash.... monkaS.
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:06:33
Never went away, just civic'ing in the back.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:57:28
Lambo dealers are having a torridly bad market right now.

You must be new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:20:56
In my once-a-month price checking, will be getting my buying shoes on again.
@_date: 2018-11-12 16:24:14
Lavish parties, Lambos, cash following like water.... such a fun guy. Now he drives a 20 year old Civic, is on food stamps, and stays home plotting his revenge.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:01:51
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:19:50
Sold all and bought Ethereum instead.
edit: bought some bitcoin too.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:29:06
Now some enterprising evangelist might set-up PraiseCoins to further fleece his sheeple. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:22:59
28 days, and still waiting to be verified. Dat backlog must be YUGE!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:19:29
Didn't want to lose further value of my BTC, and gambling that Ethereum will rise. Such is life, much tic-tacs.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:09:30
~~Kinda like mom.~~ Wait... what..... nvm!

Up-voted because who isn't down for some astral traveling. But those monks have a sweet mining set-up in the astral realm.

Not a lambo, pfffttt....
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:13:19
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:42:01
Lambo or bust!

Black lambo best lambo.

Is it ever up?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:04:51
Only one lambo, instead of two. booo....
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:56:40

Brad Sherman dreams of Lambos.
