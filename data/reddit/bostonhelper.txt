Hi Gavin,
thank you so much for taking the time to reach out and connect with our community.
My question has to do with a lot of these companies like ButterflyLabs, KnCMiner, and others, who have stolen and scammed multi millions of dollars repeatedly and continuously from their customers, and what can be done about it.
Unfortunately, todays laws and their restrictions and jurisdiction do not par well with the bitcoin community, given that it is a international thing, rather than domestic/local.
Companies like KnCMiner are well aware of this, and use these limitations to exploit the very people that have help play their roll--along with many others--in building up bitcoin.
I want to put together a website that grant companies a certificate of approval if they meet certain requirements, to provide a means for people who are interested in purchasing Bitcoin Hardware, some sort of indication that the company in question has at least some sort of legitimacy.
Is this something you would be interested in helping out with, support, and/or forward people in my direction that can help us get this off the ground?

You're involving yourself in a discussion you have absolutely no clue about, and I'll leave it at that.
Furthermore, its very disturbing that you are a mod, yet alone lead at that.

Our main objective here, is to bring this to our communities attention. These guys have gone far and beyond to truly reap the benefits of bitcoins at the expense of their customers.

By the way, I am really happy you brought up those two concerns. Made me think more about these concept.

 I, as an individual do not want that authority nor am I requesting it, what I do want is a body of individuals that come together to and establish an independent council, which can provide a hub of information, investigation  and verification to those, who might otherwise never be able to obtain such information.
Furthermore, if the plan I have in mind, consist of many different organizations that work independently from each other, there by ensure that if one or two of them drop the ball, the others may pick up the slack.
What I do want, is some matrix of entities out there, that provide a service currently not available,
I understand it will be impossible to eliminate the corruption that hinders on every corner of our society, however, I also understand just because something is impossible, it does not mean we can't take
action to reduce--to what ever degree--the frequency of such criminal behaviour

Please have, in the hundreds, but they basically said they cant help.

I believe it has something to do with being an international transaction, or that the complain was coming from a foreigner. Not sure though.

There have been hundreds of reports to the Sweden Consumer Protection Organization call Konsumentverket. Unfortunately for reason that go beyond my understanding, they stated that there was nothing they could do.
