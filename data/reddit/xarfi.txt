Mining centralization is the core problem of bitcoin as I see it.  And no one I know talks about it.

This doesn't compare in convenience to being able to buy a prepaid visa in a store for cash.

Is it possible that we're seeing a lot of whales unload their stashes.  Is this good for bitcoin? In order for it to raise in value in the future it would have to be in the hands of many.

Im in for 50000 bits

I don't understand your question.  Are you suggesting a solution where you sell a wallet with btc on it for fiat ?
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:50:35
I think the issue with this would be that the market value is constantly changing so you wouldn't want to associate a fixed BTC/Fiat price

It seems like you already understand the problems behind variance lol
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:27:12
I'm fine with this.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:17:01
Psh, tipping circle jerk -.-
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:47:03
I like you.

Virtual Boy was awesome

I think the main reason is, if you're already saving in bitcoin then it's more convenient not to have to convert back to fait before making a purchase.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:49:46
I'm asking if it's feasible to create some sort prepaid bitcoin product that could be bought in stores
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:53:53
That would be impressive

It's not racism if it's about white people ... where have you been? Someone get this guy.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:34:46
can you convert that into bk dollar sandwiches for me ?

Considering the budget of the US government or any other government.  It wouldn't be very expensive to pull off a 51% attack. If they saw bitcoins as a threat to their currency it would almost seem irresponsible for them not to spend the money no ?
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:15:58
That's why I'm just holding.  I bought 3 when they were 100 and told myself I'd either use them to buy something that I need or leave them in.  I can almost buy a PS4/XBONE with how much its gone up.

Coinbase is not an exchange :)

A miner is not defined by their incentive to mine.  A miner a machine that mines on the network.  So that would be a miner no ?
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:43:34
I'm asking if there is a way to differentiate between miner and attacker... that is all.
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:53:12
If bitcoin is seen as a threat to a government currency then it would seem likely that the government would respond in kind.  The only defense I could think of would be other governments responding and then possibly everyone involved in mining would be doing it at a loss.
@_date: 2013-09-06 11:52:14
My point was that expensive is a relative term, and relative to the budget of the US Gov or any 1st world country the price tag of 51% of the current hashing power of the infrastructure would be negligent.  It is possible that they could see an attack on the currency as a profitable action in the sense that it would devalue the bitcoin and removing it as a competitor to the US dollar.  Likewise, this action could be done outside of public eyes.  
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:05:49
This is the same government that has been in the news for eavesdropping on US citizens internet usage and information.  An action that is many times more politically dangerous and financially expensive.
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:46:46
I'm talking about people who pick up mining to undermine bitcoin legitimacy. Literally the competition, not the investors.
