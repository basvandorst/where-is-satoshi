No surprise, it was in the news a couple of weeks ago that South Korean banks were adopting crytocurrency:
With this and futures coming "hodl on for a fast ride" everyone.

Not so sure you are right about the duration, the amount sounds close, but if its going to get there I personally think it will be much much sooner, assuming we get there!

I like it, well done for using the KISS method.

My bank charged £9.50 for SEPA transfer of £500, not bad as you are then able to get far better priced bitcoin.

Yes, thats our Robbie man!!  He's from just round the corner from me in sunny Stoke.

I could transpose your cat with my wife!

Also, if you check the graph here:
it shows a more stable growth/fall pattern as it appears to plot prices at longer intervals.
Conversely, checking yourself at more regular intervals is only putting fear in your mind.  Instead relax....  :-)

Strange me/we!  No lad, we are bloody MAD!

Yes, anyone getting to that stage should consider learning how to wave:

I think you are right, they do respect strength and also appreciate resilience which bitcoin is showing too.

WELL DONE for posting this, shows you will go far.
Teachers and business advisers are normally only able to see as-far-as their own ability will allow - when faced with something NEW/cutting edge they recoil and reject the ideas.

Get setup with bitstamp or mtgox (takes several days) and do a transfer from your bank (this takes a further 3 to 5 days).  It will take from one to two weeks to make your first purchase but might save you paying well over the odds as a lot of these UK exchanges seem to be right now.

I don't think so.
Compare GOLD price over the last 5 years:
and Silver price over the last 5 years:
Both are at a 3 year low!

Hey, you could tell your dad its a special entry token to board the Star Ship Enterprise!

They always appear to be very expensive there.
Do the figures, or the "math" (as the Americans say) and compare prices with some of the main exchanges.

if its good enough for Richard Branson then it sure is good enough for me.  GOOD NEWS.

I usually use this:
and use an average of the both.

Maybe, but then its not really about the physical world.
I don't know enough about the physical side of it but there are some for sale on ebay at very high asking prices:
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:52:02
I think its:
"I have 2 physical bitcoins in my pocket" 
(any number &gt;1)
"I have lots of bitcoin in my wallet" 
(this could mean I have 0.5BCT or 5BTC, or more)

keep them bits in your kitty!

He says he does not have the economic or political expertise to have an opinion, but the security of bitcoin looks good for what he has seen - which is good:
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:55:44
Agree with them all.
I think Bitpay has great potential for all countries - maybe a separate company in each.
Phone Apps: the difficulty here is how to properly secure them?
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:04:56
That sound like good news.

I would like to think they would jump aboard but until their gov tell them to buy it probably wont happen...
Even though there is huge numbers of well educated graduates there free thinking is still not the norm.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:16:43
HAH!  Just like the ALL the BANKERS have done so for decades...
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:47:40
WOT!  "grey hair" thats me!  I rather think I have more idea than you me lad!   And a lot of others with more maturity will get and buy Bitcoin and store it safely too.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:14:31
Nice explanation - Thanks!

And which waster gambling site are you affiliated with???
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:45:50
Encryption on any site is NO GOOD.  You will have shown your private key to The Internet:  NOT SAFE.
Before spending real money spend some time here:
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:30:53


For the site owner you mean of course  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:50:06
I have a far better recommendation for you:
STOP GAMBLING on any site.
END GAME: You are wasting your time you will NOT win...

Yes, ATMs will facilitate changing currency so make it easier to trade.
When the first ATMs where installed last month the price started to rally:
