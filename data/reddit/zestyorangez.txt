computers were confusing to the mainstream 30 years ago but we were able to create more user friendly interfaces, who's to say the same can't happen for crypto ?

i admit I'm not completely versed in these topics and i don't feel like doing research at the moment, this thread was more for speculation. 
so call me out on my bullshit, i just thought it would be interesting to talk about.

i think transactions still go through but it just wont show a verification message in the thread

i was speaking in a general sense to be specific, lite coin is more cost effective to mine and supposedly, peer coin is more resistant to 51% attacks.

If only there was a time machine to jump forward 20 years. i imagine that in the end, we will have 2 or 3 optimized defacto standards of crypto.

different crypto-currencies have different properties that might be more useful in certain circumstances.

I was bringing it up as a point of discussion. personally i think there will be multiple cryptos but it's always fun to engage in speculation.

i mean to say could there be a future where multiple cryptos successfully coexist and perhaps even compliment each other? 
there are many different kinds as we are still in somewhat of a beta. I imagine that as we progress, a kind of natural selection will take place.

lets hope we can create and continue this sense of comradery  so that people stop with all of the slap fights going on.
