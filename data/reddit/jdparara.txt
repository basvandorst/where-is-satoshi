If it only gets solved tomorrow with no proper explanation, they've already lost my trust.
I do directly control the BTC. Maybe I misspoke with "I'd find it a shame to move to something I'd need to secure and manage more directly". What I meant by that is "it would be a shame to take it unto myself to move my BTC around". They really did have a nice interface :-P

BTW if you have a minute, pls recommend me what you use for your wallet.

Heh, sorry I deleted the post of mine that just quoted you like you did me. The "I do not think the code..." part. Are you sure the code is generated server-side?
I am not so sure, reading their FAQ.

Sorry I am going on about it when you've given good answers... But why not Trezor at the moment?

Okay thank you for this reply. So even if they are open-source it may not be obvious what they are up to as there may be interim updates? I can buy that.
I guess they just lost another customer.

I understand this now, after 4 years use of them with no issue. I mainly went with them as I retain sole retention of my private keys and it seemed that their their interface is very user-friendly/safe. But it would be nice if someone could explain the issue they're having.
I'd find it a shame to move to something I'd need to secure and manage more directly.

As far as I understand, blockchain.info have no control over your wallet. It's just an interface. I can get the BTC with no issue, I'm just wondering why the front-end is misbehaving. It will be a pain to move elsewhere.
Unless I'm missing something here..!

It's all done client-side and I believe is open-source. Have you looked into how blockchain.info works?

You disagree..? So they do have some control over the wallets?
