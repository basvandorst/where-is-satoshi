Alex 'Bruce Leroy' Caceres is a hell of an exciting fighter. He may not ever be the best, but he's a fight/martial arts nerd who loves to get out there and try all the wacky shit that people say will never be effective in the Octagon (until someone comes along, makes it effective and everyone adopts it, see: judo, oblique kicks and spinning shit amongst many more).

I'm not part of the bitcoin community here on reddit, I was drawn over from r/mma so excuse me if I step on any toes with this suggestion.
I support the idea of sponsoring a UFC fighter, since I know a lot of them are underpaid, but there can be difficulties in getting your brand into the UFC. **If** that happens, or if you have any interest in going a different direction, I'd suggest you look into Invicta, the WMMA franchise. It's very young, but it has incredible good will with the fans and every single fight card I've watched (4 of the 7 they've put together so far) has been outstanding in terms of the talent. Obviously, Invicta doesn't draw a wide audience quite yet, but they are very highly regarded amongst MMA fans and they have some very marketable fighters.
Just a thought!

And I'd like to add/point out that it can be as low as 8k if they lose their fight and that often won't cover a fighter for a full training camp and bringing the necessary corner men with him to the fight (since the UFC only covers one person travelling with the fighter).
