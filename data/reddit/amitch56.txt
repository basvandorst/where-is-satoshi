It's like they have no understanding at all.

[canadian bitcoins]( is brokerage, you can buy/sell but you don't hold your coins there.

That's the way I was looking at, but you have to tell the waitress how much your tipping so she includes it in the bill.  That's different then how people pay bills here (they enter it themselves in the terminal if paying by credit).

That would be ideal but bitpay generates a new address for each payment (their mobile to mobile app).  I guess at the end of the night they can go through all the bitpay transactions and count their own.

Clocktower has the Bitcoin ATM, but doesn't accept bitcoins.

They are also insignificant at pennies per transaction regardless of the cost.  So while you pay a fixed amount + % using traditional payment methods that adds up if moving large amounts, you pay just a few cents with bitcoin (if you choose to include the transaction fee which is optional).

Thanks, I've used virtex before and prefer to use them.  Reason I sold this time was on Gox was because virt had no liquidity at that time and was 50-70 cents lower for bids.
@_date: 2012-06-16 19:34:42
Prices were a lot higher on Gox than cavirtex.

We currently are mining with FPGA.  If and when ASICS come out, we plan on reinvesting in such technology in order to maintain the current dividend.
@_date: 2012-11-22 15:42:37
Exactly.  They say they offer that ability to buy/sell in CAD and withdraw in that currency.  You can't say that but then say, 'oh but you'll have to take it in USD'.  It's not my responsibility to perform the currency exchange for them.
@_date: 2012-11-22 13:45:18
Is Gox defaulting on paying withdrawals??  
EDIT:  I've been waiting since Oct 23 for this withdrawal.
EDIT 2 (11/26)  I've received confirmation that my withdrawal has been processed.  I'm not sure if this would have happened by itself, or this thread plus the one on bitcointalk forced them to actually respond and investigate.
EDIT 3 (11/27): Received my withdrawal.

I imagine it would depend on how many currencies you are supporting.  If its only CAD to BTC then you would be fine because any deposits/withdrawals client make would be in CAD.  I can see it get difficult to balance when you have a dozen+ currencies like Gox. But still, that's their job to manage.  They can't just say we'll pay you when we have the money' which is what I feel has happened.
@_date: 2012-11-23 14:23:37
One person I deal with is also waiting a CAD withdrawal from late October.  
@_date: 2012-11-23 14:31:54


Well that's great.  You ran out of money a month ago and use a current holiday as an excuse?  I've been contacting support for a couple weeks now.  What were they actually doing?  Just dismissing my inquiry?
@_date: 2012-11-22 14:43:20
My original inquiry was asking why there was a delay in receiving my funds.  I've waited two weeks before but never this long.  I received essentially templated answers 'It's processing at our bank..." etc.  But this message today has me worried.   If they offer the ability to withdraw in the currency that you sold the coins in, then they should be able to actually fulfill their obligation in a reasonable time.  Its not difficult to use a bank for currency exchange either if they don't have enough CAD.
@_date: 2012-06-16 02:13:17
The delay at Gox is outrageous.  Heard that they only process certain currencies on certain days.  And today was suppose to be CAD but one person had incorrect banking info which stalled the whole batch.  Incredible.

@_date: 2012-11-22 15:51:25
One note, I do pay a conversion fee already when I sell BTC in CAD and there is no matching person selling in CAD (and they have to match to bids listed in USD for example).  What bothers me is I don't know when I sell BTC is if the buyer is bidding in USD, so that cost is unpredictable.  But that's another issue altogether.  
@_date: 2012-11-22 19:03:36
I've old sold BTC for CAD and withdrawn.  Usually its only taken 2 weeks.
EDIT: For the why? Because virtex price is either seriously lagging Gox or not enough volume on virtex.  I prefer virtex but sometimes have to move the coins for time considerations (though that might have backfired in this case).
@_date: 2012-11-22 14:40:09
CAD via bank wire.  I've had it take 2 weeks before but never this long.

I have to say, this is pretty juvenile behaviour.  Everyone understands BFL has been terrible at customer service and delivering, but "wreaking havok" sounds like a threat to their privacy and safety.

Btc tc was registered as a company in Belize. But it didn't have the license to operate as an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:11:15
You can't deposit/withdraw CAD or am I mistaken?
@_date: 2013-07-06 16:20:09
Have you tried withdrawing money from gox to canada? I've had to wait weeks before. Usually get virt withdrawals in a day or two.  Worth it IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:32:13
You received yours from an October order?  That's pretty good...i'm still waiting on the august order (gold).   I've emailed them numerous times still nothing of substance.  I get you may have delays but its now 3 months.

BTCproof says the bitcoins sent to that address at lost.  Is there a way to create the bitcoin address form your hashed info so that its in your own wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:39:20
You're confusing the value of a currency with the value of what you're purchasing with it.  If you buy investments with bitcoins, then you have tangible assets.

ASICM yield on Havelock is at ~26%, so the price seems reasonable given the return.

It's the price volatility that makes people hesitant to spend.  IE why buy something online for 1 BTC today when you think it'll be worth .8 btc tomorrow?  Price needs to be relatively stable for btc to succeed.

from Libertybit.com: "The Bitcoin network imposes a fee on what it considers risky transactions. To prevent this, allow your transactions to accrue more confirmations before sending them."
Isn't it that you can pay a fee to speed up transactions?  Otherwise, who decides what's considered risky?
