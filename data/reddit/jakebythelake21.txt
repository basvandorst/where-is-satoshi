What if you sell high and then it goes higher? No one knows for sure the direction the price will go. Personally, I think it will continue to go higher in the long run so, I'm not about to miss a bull run because I thought I was selling "high" at that time.

Hmm, I'm pretty confident that nothing will surpass it in terms of total marketcap (future forks of BTC don't count!)... Tell you what. I'll put up 3:1 odds that no coin is going to top it. If you pick a coin that you think is gonna do it, I'll consider even higher odds.
Keep in mind that I do think some coins will gain ground on BTC...

Nobody knows that answer definitively. Lots of people like to make baseless predictions though. If YOU believe it is going to go back up eventually, then buy more BTC now to lower your overall cost average.

I think a lot of people may not understand this image. The DWave is a quantum computer. They are geared towards solving extremely difficult problems (breaking encryptions, analyzing massive amounts of data, and theoretically mining cryptocurrency). I don't remember the specifics from my Quantum Electronics course but to put into perspective: an efficient quantum computer can theoretically break encryptions in seconds/minutes of which would take thousands of years to break on an array of modern computers.

It's got staying power. It's the first coin new investors hear about. There's an ETF on the horizon. It's on every exchange I know of. The technology is improving. There's only 21 million coins. It has survived many setbacks and always comes back stronger.

I think that a couple of these current top coins may not be relevant in just a few years. But to suggest that they're all worthless is silly in my opinion. I think Bitcoin is and will remain "King" but I'd bet that one or two of those coins will gain significant ground on BTC without fully surpassing it.

Throw it in Bitcoin. Don't move it for a long time.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:54:23
And that's your OPINION! I agree with it but it's still just an opinion.

I've got news for you, buddy. You're gonna shit tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that. Not finite. Try again.

If you'd really like to go down this path, Prove to me that he has a finite number of years to live. You can't...

There is a finite amount of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. You cannot say the same about paper money or even tangible resources like gold, silver, natural gas, etc... This makes it a sought after commodity at the very least and therefore it has intrinsic value. Most people are not on board with this thought process yet and are watching from the sidelines. There are 36 million millionaires in the world. If each one of them wanted one single full bitcoin, it wouldn't be possible. How's that for value?
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:46:16
Ahh, but there's only one bitcoin! And it is finite.

This is probably something you'd want to do by yourself if you're actually considering it.
