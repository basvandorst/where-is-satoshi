Why does every country strive for a small inflation then? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:51:15
Well at least I can send their coin and receive it within minutes.. While here I am waiting hours for my bitcoin even when reasonable fees have been set. Is this what we are striving at? Becoming a store of value? This is not the bitcoin I thought of back in 2012.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:54:31
Oh with that I agree fully. Well, hopefully it will overcome it, but when many in here are calling bcash for scam while their coin works better than ours.. I mean, it just doesn't seem right.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:10:08
Nobody will use it as a currency then, if holding your money makes it worth more. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:02:40
Is it a marketing scheme? Their community is strong, they offer help and solidarity, more and more merchants are beginning to accept it. They encourage you to use your BCH to strive towards p2p usage. I can't speak to the technicals of it (other than it is of course a fork of bitcoin), but what makes you say "Ohh, I wouldn't touch it with an eight foot pole".

I have been buying bitcoin for years, but I first heard about ETH in the summer after it surged upwards to 300$, I wish I had just read about it beforehand, it was obvious that it had huge potential, I just stood there "Wish I had read about this when it first come out".. Oh well..
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:16:17
That's not the point though, the point is to view it via the eyes of the "other side". 
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:17:42
The problem is that the conflict is ideological, it means that there is no true answer, it depends on what your principles are. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:21:08
Yeah, you totally don't sound ignorant as fuck.

His 0.005 might be relatively equivalent to yours 500 BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:03:09
Totally agree. Right now the only people buying bitcon are either doing it to invest, to support the concept or to buy through the black market. I hope it won't be long before crypto apps/banks get mainstream and secure enough for the average joe to use, but we have sadly still a long way to go. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:28:24
Many use bitcoin for markets to buy products, however, if you want to earn money on it and not intent on using it to buy stuff, yes the idea is to buy low and buy high. The thing is, you don't know what "high" is and what "low" is, your 50 dollars might be worth 2000 suddenly, or it might crash and it would be worth 5 dollars. It's basically sort of a gamble at this point. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:26:26
Yes that is very much possible, but as you probably already know the increase won't be high as it is a low amount you have. If it crashes, on the other hand, you won't lose much.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:22:45
It will either go up high to above 3000-4000$ or it will fall and crash, it's a risk either way. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:26:25
 This podcast explains it pretty well, it looks into both the benefits and cons in regards to segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:22:24
Transactions that have 1 input, 2 outputs and many signatures would get an unfair discount compared to a 1 input, 2 outputs and a single signature. One could argue that it is making things that are more complex cheaper, and things more simple more expensive. So in that sense, it is an argument against segwit as it is tracking us in a wrong direction. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:14:21
It sure is interesting. Let's see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:11:59
While it is a step in the right direction (albeit ETH is already there) it is nowhere close to what ETH has to offer. 20% in fees, good luck selling that to users. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:13:01
Will it work though? Won't the price almost be equal to what it was before?
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:33:15
As soon as simply 1 coin from the genesis block gets moved BTC is likely to crash - he is stuck with billions he can't access. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:35:47
Exactly, I mean, realistically it won't happen, but theoretically there is a chance of it occuring, and if that happens (notice the word "if"), then it would crash BTC. But honestly it isn't something I would worry about.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:54:44
People might panic due to the hard fork and thus creating a minor crash.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:12:39
Etheruem devs are currently developing ZN-Snarks where you can choose to make transactions private. 


If BTC doesn't get their shit together, ETH might very well become the next big coin (the so-called flippening), I mean it would be sad for BTC to go down in popularity, but I am invested in both so I don't really mind it that much. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:58:46
Hide in my safe space? I was not being defensive by telling you that you are making personal attacks, I am criticizing your way of arguing. 
While segwit alleviates some of the problems we are facing now, it is not clear whether it can be a long term solution. You sound like a zealous kid who just wants the first candy he laid his eyes on, thus ignoring other possibilities instead of chanting the same line over and over again. Are we sure this is the best approach? I try to mildly question segwit and some of you go nuts, I am not even against segwit simply trying to view things from various angles, honestly this is very humoring.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:35:59
Keyword being WHEN. People has said they are waiting for the crash since 1200$, and they will buy more when that happens.. They regret not buying at that point. If it goes up to 10k you will regret not buying at this point. Not saying you should buy, just saying it's a risk either way.
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:52:25
Never claimed to be an expert, heard this argument and I was curious to see the argument against it, this sub at times appears to be like an echo-chamber chanting segwit, I am interested in the nuances so I can learn more. There are legit concerns with segwit, most of which seem to be discarded by the majority here, we should be able to discuss everything to become more informed, and not simply enter an discussion because you already think you are have the correct answer. Notice your response is 75% personal attacks, regardless of who is wrong here, I do not like the mentality. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:08:12
Because we would know someone who has 1 million coins has the power to dump the whole market, right now most think he is dead. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:19:34
Go research ETH, they are doing great things, and their community and devs are fucking awesome. I love BTC, but there is just too much drama, I really think ETH is showing more and more promise over BTC. I hope both do good though.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:05:14
Etheruem is gaining a lot of momentum.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:54:57
Dude, we are on the same team, I love bitcoin, but it's very clear that ETH on the fundamentals side is far ahead. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:24:50
I'm new? It seems like you have no idea what you are talking about. Look, I love BTC and what it has done for my life, I have been invested in it since 2013. I were like you, thinking that BTC is levels beyond ETH, but tell me just 1 thing that BTC does better, you won't be able to. 
PoS is flashy bells? Are you kidding me? Do you know what Proof of Stake is? If it gets implemented it will be freaking revolutionary. This is just the top of the iceberg of what ETH is capable of: countries are using ETH to confirm identities, they are using it as a network distributer, they are using it to create 3D images, the possibilites are endless. 
On top of that, raiden is being developed which is basically sort of like the lighting network that might come with segwit (even though ETH transactions are already much faster than BTC transactions). ZK-snarks is almost finished being developed, where you can choose to make your transactions anonymous. Metropolis is right around the corner. All of this, and yet BTC is still stuck at scaling issues. ETH has a clear vision, BTC is fighting among each other. ETH developers are fiduciaries that care for the best of the society, I sadly can't say the same for BTC developers. The only benefit to BTC is that it is recognizable among the mainstream, but this is also changing. You say it is a good thing that BTC is resistant to change, lol, I would argue that is exactly why it is beginning to have major problems, it is stuck between self-interest and ideological problems.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:38:23
Watch the podcast, it will shed light on a few perspectives. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:55:11
When the question is "I want advice on how to invest", all opinions are equally valid lol. No one can foresee the future my man.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:13:27
Ahh, I were like you a couple of months ago, well, let's see in 6 months or a years time how you will feel about it then.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:31:12
I am not saying it is unfair, I am saying one COULD see it as unfair: if more signatures lead to a bigger discount due to the segwit part of it, it would mean that something more complicated is getting a bigger discount compared to if it had occurred through simpler ways, some agree with this sentiment due to ideological reasons. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:26:57
I doubt that will happen, but we'll see. Exciting times nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:12:37
I am not giving it as advice, it simply has the biggest probability of happenning. Everything can happen indeed.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:28:16
Just saying, ETH can do everything that BTC can faster, better and more securely. Only difference is the fact that BTC was here first. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:38:18
You are correct, the movement of simply 1 coin could crash the whole network. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:21:27
The thing is, we haven't heard anything from "them" or "him" in years, if he simply sells 1 coin, then every investor who has bitcoin will know that someone who has 1 million bitcoins has the power to crash the whole network if they choose too. This would lead to mass hysteria and many will sell (many investors has millions invested in bitcoin). As such, if he moves 1 coin, it will crash, maybe not all the way down, but it will nonetheless create a crash to a certain degree. 
My opinion is though, that even if he is alive, he will never touch those coins: Satoshi is highly ideological, having money doesn't matter for this group or person, it is the idea of bitcoin that matters, as such, I they will never move them again. Oh, and the group or he might be in prison or dead, so there's that. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:18:34
Really appreciate that you are writing this, I totally agree. I mean, everything can be googled, but that's not why we are on this forum. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:15:39
Let's just stop the discussion here, only time will tell who is right.
!remindme 365 days btc vs eth
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:44:28
I am surprised that your research of Ether has been this bad, I was all for bitcoin, but Ether's community is fucking awesome, and you can actually write to the developers to get actual answers, unlike the BTC community where most are only looking out for their own self-interest. 
Originally I was all in on BTC, I starting reading up on ETH just for giggles, but it turned out it has much bigger potential than BTC could ever get. 
Smart contracts are great because they allow you to do many useful things on the blockchain cheaply, transparently, and securely. Some would even argue that smart contracts will cause an economic paradigm shift where the blockchain supplants real world middlemen.
Cutting out the middlemen for Internet services
One example is the replacement of Internet broker companies such as Airbnb, Amazon, and Uber with smart contracts. A service like Airbnb is desirable because it obviates the need for the host and the guest to trust each other, they need only trust Airbnb. With smart contracts, the host and the guest can forego Airbnb and put their trust on the blockchain. In doing so, they avoid paying Airbnb’s high brokering fees.
When there’s a dispute after the contract has concluded (funds transfered and keys exchanged hands), such as if the host kicks the guest out or the guest squats, either party can go to the authorities and use the blockchain as irrefutable proof of the contract’s terms and the opposing parties wrongdoings.
BTC is just a valuta, its only advantage is that it got here first, other than that, ETH can do everything BTC can faster, better and more secure. They are developing PoS, incredible if that could in the upcoming 1-2 years. I am not against BTC, but seriously, try visit the ETH subreddit, it's like night and day compared to this community. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:11:38
It's just crazy that we have 2 communities saying the exact opposite of each other, never experienced such a thing before.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:38:22
What the hell, this changelly website is basically scamming people, thank god you had some common sense and didn't just buy at their ridicolous low price. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:52:27
Thank you a lot my man!
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:14:05
Lucky bastard..
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:06:54
A lot of people are talking about ETH and Ripple(I think it's called that)? Not sure how promising they are though.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:56:07
I was so close to buy when it was 1900.. I wanted it to be below 1800 before I decided to buy, it got up to 2500 the next week.
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:46:33
Not familiar with the site, but if it's an exchange you should have an "sell" option somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:22:00
What about the whole seqwit-chainblock split? Could that cause a crash? I feel like I need to understand that fully before I dare to buy when it is above 2500$
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:31:41
Well, things are looking brighter now with a consensus on segwit2x looking to maybe come into action. The odds are less in favor of a crash now, but it might still happen, I wouldn't put more than I can afford to lose, nor put it all in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:59:39
My only advice is to wait to do it after 1. august. In my honest opinion, it is a bit too big of a risk to put 20k right before the segwit ordeal, a crash might happen, or the price might skyrocket. Nonetheless, read the basics about bitcoin, read about what is happening with segwit and the arguments for/against, and decide for yourself whether you want to take the risk. 
Personally, I don't want to miss out on a major rise, so I do hold bitcoin. But at the same time I am not going all in, because a crash might come, and if it happens Bitcoin is gonna lose face and it will take a long time for it to recover (if ever). 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:48:27
Search google "bitcoin wallet", there are like more than 10 or different kinds of software out there. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:39:08
Holy shit, thanks a lot my man. I am really interested in making the exact same excel-sheet, it really gives a good overview. Could you be willing to upload the sheet so I could insert my own numbers? I am willing to send you money for it if you are interested? Would save me hell of a lot of time. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:22:47
Where do you see sarcasm? It's utterly insane (from an outside perspective) to see two bitcoin communities say the exact opposite of each other. r/BTC saying r/bitcoin is propaganda and the reverse is true.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:14:06
I am not a bitcoin fanatic, but people (including myself) have been thinking it is a bubble since it hit 1K$ 
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:54:23
I would love it if you could tell a bit more on how to make that sheet so all of the calculations (money spent on fees, what BTC needs to be in order to make money) is in order. Is it possible for you to upload a sheet or something?
Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:00:01
Oh bro, I really can't give that kind of advice, I am also a newbie.. Just started researching, I am gonna buy at the next correction. Haven't quite read about ETH and LTC. Always do research before you buy!
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:52:06
It's way too early for a slow and constant growth. If the whole 1. august ordeal gets settled and it stabilizes, I think it would show great promise.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:10:43
Dude, they are saying the exactly same thing over there (op posted this in r/btc too) I am confused as fuck.. Who the hell is lying here?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:34:35
This is known as arbitrage. It's possible if the price is different enough, however, most likely it isn't worth it as you will come out with a negative due to fees, bank fees etc. etc.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:18:14
RemindMe! 4 years
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:41:00
It wasn't as pretty in real life, but yeah it is pretty realistic. However, I would buy to buy after 1. august to see how things end up with segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:23:41
So true, like, if it is almost down to a worthless price, why not hold and see if it rises to its regular price? This is a good idea unless you have over 100 bitcoins, but who of us got that kind of btc's..
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:56:14
I hope so too. It would be sad if you didn't buy today and it rocketed to 10K, reversly, also sad if you bought a lot today and it crashed shortly afterwards. I am considering buying a small amount, that way I win either way in a small sense.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:12:49
It's usefullness would be limited to a small cap then though. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:53:04
This is extremely techincal, basically we have problems in regards to how bitcoin is being transferred (high fees). People want to solve the problem, but they disagree as to how it should be done. Segwit is 1 solution, (I don't even know enough to tell you if it is good or bad solution), however. On 1. August, they will try to change the bitcoin infrastructure. Worst case scenario, bitcoin crashes as it can lead to 2 different currencies if they can't fix it. If they find a solution, bitcoin could rise to 10K dollars and more as it gets more stable. We have no idea what will happen, but I would advise not to buy more than you can afford to lose before 1. august to at least see what will happen.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:01:28
I am from scandinavia, so I buy from a site in which I can send money and get bitcoin instantly over the phone. I also use kraken and bitstamp. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:18:08
He means that they are on the exchange site, and not in a private wallet with a private key, they are still his coins, but they are not his coins if you get what I am saying, because he still needs to send them to a wallet for them to be 100% private.
