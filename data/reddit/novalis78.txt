Have you actually visited their website once? I can't believe you are making these false claims...It almost sounds as if you are from their competition - if they had competition. Look at all the respectable people on their board:  and  You might want to reconsider and wish them good luck, in a gentlemen way, without "trashtalking" the project just because it's backers are audacious in their proposal.

was it paid for in :-)

Checkout the roadmap: 
2018 is just the unmanned lander as proof of concept for water extraction etc.

Then why not make that point right away. That's honest. I think most proponents of this project would agree that the majore problem is funding. Or government resolution to embark on such a mission. Should not we all be wishing them good luck on such a profound vision that might unite mankind? Especially when we know that, technically, it's not impossible?

thanks. drove around with it today and was thinking: is this like early 90's when the first "URL" would show up on buses etc... maybe in a few years you'll see the QRs everywhere. LOL.
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:47:15
thanks, good idea. will probably not be the last version...

"A Case for Mars" by Aerospace engineer Dr. Robert Zubrin shows clearly that such a mission is easier today than the moonlanding was in 1969. This is a great article explaining the realistic possibility:

but what about bitcoin on Mars, i.e. Marscoin - is that really an altcoin or a bit altplanet coin? :-)
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:25:04
version 1.0. next one will cover the driver's door. LOL. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:40:35
so you mean like most startups? By that measure "every" attempt in break-through technology is a "scam".
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:29:25
I am pretty sure Christopher Columbus trip to the Americas and the idea of a man landing on the moon were considered equally outrageous. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:42:32
LOL. Thought about that too... I am soooo glad bitcoin transactions are not reversible.... But you could send some dust with a "message" regarding the driving style...

Thanks "Oracle of Knowledge" ... I love that about bitcoin as well, sending tips left and right... the other day I explained to someone at the office how bitcoin works and how amazing it is once you have some. In order to demonstrate, I just randomly looked up a "google image bitcoin qr code" and some random person, via my mobile phone a couple of cents scanning the google image. It felt "futuristic"
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:29:37
...and with google glass...every street corner might entice a quick "tip" he he
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:37:00
exactly. Check out marscoin.org. It's a fan project and hopes to help with the funding.
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:05:12
LOL...I need to get you google glasses with a QR-auto-seek-and-tip app
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:12:09
I am at the parking lot, and someone wants to give me some change. I'll say: just scan the back of my car, LOL.
And then, of course, there is the whole world of car body advertisement... if they start learning about bitcoin you could see things like: "Send us .5BTC and get a discount on your next AC repair". But yes, the main idea was to get people curious about bitcoin and make them realize what this technology allows.

It's not a scam. Please check your facts. A scam would imply that their whole project just serves the purpose to fraudulently gain money. While it is extremely optimistic, it is not impossible. In fact funding seems to be the only really show-stopper. Make sure you watch this recent interview with Dr. Robert Zubrin, the "father" of a human Mars mission who is also on the board of Mars One: 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:36:28
That's where the Marscoin.org project comes in.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:04:12
Many of them are engineers, some with medical background. There is a 9 year training period though - but the biggest challenge will not so much the technical (as that can be learnt) as the psychological challenge. I think that's why the initial selection criteria were broader.

let's make it even more complicated +5 MRS

You do not need a new propulsion system. Traveling with a conventional rocket at 5km/s delta v it will take 180 days one way.

"Harry, I still don't understand that bitcoin thing" - "See the car over there, take a picture with your phone and send him 10 cents" :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:37:31
That's just part of the funding if you read carefully.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:55:47
looks like Marscoin has sprung into existence already: 
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:27:43
Yes, of course. Send me a pm and we can look into an escrow that you prefer.

My thinking. If I had been one of the top 500 I'd be working on it right now. Or at least helping, whatever gets us closer.
