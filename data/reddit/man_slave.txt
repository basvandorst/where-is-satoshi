Did you know disco record sales are up 400% for the year ending 1976? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:22:43
segwit evidently does not have consensus, otherwise it would be widely adopted and our fees would be driven down.

The investors of blockstream. Sort of

Did they move any Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:42:16
Light clients were recommend because of the size of the blockchain and the fact that it could take days to download. Nothing has changed.
However something might change once they implement pruning.
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:21:36
So, a bank
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:09:17
Low fees and instant transactions aye?
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:00:15
All you need for 95% is a release that's not as contentious and politicized.

There's fucking audio of him saying it

did you delete the post or did the mods?

why is it a disaster?

I was hoping

@_date: 2015-01-15 21:06:46
Misleading. 
To be clear, everyone, defense has NOT made the argument Mark Karpeles was DPR, instead got a DHS agent to admit he was a suspect"
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:50:28




By the looks of it OP ain't the one getting paid
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:43:05
Money just like 99% of everyone else
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:11:01
It's a very old story. Check google
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:44:33
What lending site is he referring to?
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:25:53
What is considered spam?
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:55:33
Not private and not instant but ok.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:36:02
So with consensus it can be done and in line with his vision. Great!
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:18:53
ask a lawyer
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:30:48
But it's already been proven that we can increase it right now.
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:31:45
Considering that we're prohibited from discussing certain relevant ideas and events, I'd say no.
@_date: 2018-10-07 03:54:29
oh but segwit only gained "consensus" through underhanded political trickery and segwit transactions are only now closing in on 50%
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:50:10
No it's up like 10%
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:32:54
they were not. it was a temporary cap to protect against spam attacks.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:35:06
That's all politics. It is out there working right now and it *could* have been working in core if it weren't for the toxic politics surrounding it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:15:29


@_date: 2017-08-01 14:05:26
Even if there was it would be horribly inaccurate until the difficulty is recalculated and blocks start being found regularly. Current Bitcoin Cash hash rate is likely around 2% of the network based off mining pools stats
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:23:32
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:22:22
We hit the cap and fees were exorbitant.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:23:20
Full capacity being what? 8x the current btc capacity iirc?
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:50:48
If we're quoting satoshi then we must also admit that it was temporary.
“We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.”
“It can be phased in, like
    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
   maxblocksize = largerlimit
  It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
 When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.”
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:19:04
Not every big block supporter supports a minority hash power fork
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:01:04
Having 90% of the hash rate 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:22:49
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:47:36
@_date: 2017-01-29 16:08:55
There is no way they were locked inside. Locked out sure, but it would be the greatest most criminal design flaw ever if they could be locked inside.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:19:27
Nope. Plenty of people I agree with are toxic. I called out some of them below.
Hard to reach consensus on a topic when you can't openly discuss it.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:00:25
lol near universal support, what a joke. You can't silence and exile people from the community and then claim universal support. 
The 95% was gained by way of the segwit2x agreement that was later reneged on. UASF never had enough economically relevant support.
With all due respect I can almost guarantee I've been in this community longer than you. I've seen all the arguments over and over and over again I've seen the community somehow get even more toxic than ever. I've seen toxic people rise to power and somehow stay there (Roger Ver &amp; CW included) while some of the best people are cast aside. Bitcoin in its current state and everything that happened with the block wars has turned it into a laughing stock.
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:29:05
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:39:21
Which has always been the case
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:24:31
That's a total bullshit answer from their twitter, every other release has had the hashes match the encrypted file. It's absolutely terrible opsec if you can't verify a file without decrypting it.
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:30:32
Mr Bribe, wink wink
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:41:21
He's very technically skilled but he's also very dumb.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:32:06
Give this sub back to Atlas
props to anyone that's been around long enough to understand this joke
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:57:30
No, it has something to do with BitcoinXT. It might not be the direct cause but it's a contributing factor
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:09:11
lol no
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:08:01
Probably not
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:08:33
Guess what I'm doing today...
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:55:38
That's not a secret, he advertises it openly. If you were on the other sub you'd know that.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:08:05
Node count doesn't matter, it didn't matter with xt, it didn't matter with classic and it doesn't matter with unlimited. Hash rate is what matters.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:06:33
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:45:28
there *was* a compromise on the table and you wouldn't have gotten segwit without it
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:31:38
ehh it's 90% of what counts. Back when classic had a bunch of nodes running the mantra was "nodes count doesn't matter hashrate does" but suddenly nodes are important again.
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:02:48
Here's the chart that actually matters 
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:08:40
Correct me if I'm wrong, but never before has a bitcoin core release advertised new features.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:22:54
It's been said plenty of times but I've never seen any first hand accounts of it or any proof. Google turns up nothing
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:18:33
On the other hand lets not forget about btcdrak and peter todd and their viacoin shenanigans 
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:18:37
Is bittrex a wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:20:46
rich peer to rich peer
@_date: 2016-09-01 19:53:43


There is no collecting bitcoin. You pay their wallet and they distribute it. Super smart and cutting edge huh?
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:01:27


Yea that already happened due to inaction.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:54:40
It could have been prevented, there was a compromise on the table.
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:14:43
Not with tx fees it isn't
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:36:42


@_date: 2019-01-18 15:39:55
I don't want it regardless of what chain it's on
@_date: 2016-09-20 14:06:04
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:30:20
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:45:13
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:02:01
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:03:36
That can't be true
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:10:17
No surprise there. I asked luke-jr to look into ways to counter this but of course he wasn't concerned.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:28:17


Woah way to re-write history, all that happened way after you sold
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:38:42
It won't
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:27:02
Miners and others have explained exactly why they don't want segwit and it's not to keep fees high.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:48:56
are you serious?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:28:50
For consistency shouldn't you ban linking of it like you did with other alt implementations?
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:19:00
I don't think they are
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:45:47
And the NYA is the same as the HK agreement that was reached a year and a half ago.....
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:22:52
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:05:50
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:13:23
By that logic core supporters paid for the AWS  XT, Classic and Unlimited nodes in order to discredit them.
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:06:39
Oh boy a blacklist!
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:18:20
“To be clear, this investigation turned up evidence to identify Vinnik not as a hacker/thief but as a money launderer”
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:35:30
We have a solution on the table but core won't accept it. segwit+2mb 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:01:13
However, anyone can use the platform to promote anything
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:06:32
....and the other chain will still have more
