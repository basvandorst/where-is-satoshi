Yes, maybe not the original crypto currency, misleading title (people get so serious) but Tide has been used as a decentralized currency for the past 20 years.

I'm currently making huge profits with BCH. Took me a while to understand how to get my hands on them.

If only Bitcoin wallets had fraud protection... oh wait.

Target/CVS accept bitcoin??

Gold is not a currency, a currency by definition needs to be generally accepted in open markets. You can't buy milk with gold. Neither can you with bit coin... yet. But why would i ever spend my bit coin? It's nicely growing as is.

1) What is the block chain exactly? 
2) Theoretically speaking, is it possible that a majority of miners in the network decide to agree within themselves to mine more than 25 bit coins per block chain (i.e.: not reject the fraudulous work of each other and maximizing their profits)?

Why, in your opinion, is it that some economists compare bitcoin to tulips? Is bit coin too "complicated" to reach mainstream?

I used Coinbase and generated a picture of a paper wallet with the option of sending funds to that picture. I then printed the picture. So it's gone form my online wallet and is on the picture. I want to give the paper to my friend so that he can have a bit coin. I just made him create an online account/wallet (which is empty). How does HE extract the bit coin from the paper on to his online wallet?

Thank you so much for posting this. I posted [this] ( a couple of days ago. I had the worst feedback from Bitcoin circle jerkers.

Could you expand on the last sentence please?
