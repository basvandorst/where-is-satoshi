Do they have any leads?

Can they really do anything with the data sent over in a wire transfer though? If so, wire transfers would be a bad idea in general

It is a big assumption that demand will be stagnant. The part of demand that comes from investors/speculators can be expected to decrease greatly around that milestone.

Social darwinism is not any kind of biological or political science, and it does not try to explain or predict anything

"They never learn and always consume" - that's an incredibly pompous generalization

I had to scroll past so many knee jerk comments before this

You know this is also exactly what someone who is dumping his coins would say, right? I'm not saying this is what you're doing, but this whole 'hold spartans' mentality is very silly. There is no room for it in investing

I'm very curious how the rates in different exchanges can be so divergent? Any idea why people don't play on the gap?
It might be sensible not to do it because it's too volatile as you said, but surely there must be many people who would take the risk.. 
Actually, come to think of it, even before now there seemed to be discrepancies between the exchanges (though I'm by no means sure about this).. Curious

Can you explain why it doesn't make sense?

One question.. When you say "While the potential buyers don’t have access to the markets due to lag, Bob sends sell orders to clear all the bids and push prices down", doesn't the lag affect Bob as well though? Also, people may have placed buy orders beforehand at the lower price as well (indeed, the mtgoxlive chart often seems to have a lot of buy orders at lower prices as well). Meaning, he might not have too much of an edge in buying at the lower price?

By "bank run" with quotations, he obviously meant panic selling due to people being afraid of not getting their initial capital back, so I think it makes sense -whether or not it's true
(I didn't ask as an argumentative rhetoric, I didn't know what fractional reserve meant at the time, so I thought you might have another point)

But the thing is, even though DDOS is transient, the expectation is that it will lower the prices, so it also makes rational sense to sell when it happens and buy back after the price fall. I guess the market can mature to pull that buy-back point closer to the sell-off point, but it seems to me that there will also always be an incentive to sell off during an incident like a massive DDOS 
This made me think of an article I read years ago about solar eclipses having a negative effect on the stock market, and I saw this comment that explains my point perfectly:
