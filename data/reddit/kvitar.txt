Warren Buffet spreading some FUD here. The old guard doesn't want to accept that the party is over. BTC/LTC/ETH and the good projects are going to usurp the entire system they've built their fortunes on.

Well isn't most of the $ coming from Bithumb?

It's bullshit. Furthermore, Charlie Lee announces that he is selling all his LTC the day before BCH goes. Let's hope BCH drops HARD

That's pretty weak. The integrity of the art is lost on a fallacy. The portrait represents a man who vehemently denied the identity you're assuming. Anyone who buys this to give glory to Satoshi is willfully ignorant.

2 Trillion? In cash? Really?

Inflation cam be bad when wages are stagnant and asset prices increase, as we see today in the US in equities, housing, education, healthcare and insurance

Zzzz another call for doom. Can we at least throw an asteroid or cyborg army in there to spice it up?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:34
100% agree. At the end of the day, it's either get a piece or get rekt

ETH drops below 300, dude jumps off bridge, next week it's at 550. I call that social Darwinism

The banks won't allow a fair game tho. Crypto is deeply manipulated 24/7
@_date: 2018-10-29 01:59:20
It's stable bc any new liquidity that comes in is scalped by HFT and spoof/wash trades, but there's a foundation of hodlrs that keep the intrinsic value from going to zero. 
Bottom line, until BTC gets the same treatment and regulations as other markets, algos and futures will keep the price controlled. 
The futures markets were the FED and banking dynasties answer to the threat that crypto once was. 
Gold has been manipulated as well with ETFS and contracts that 99% don't have the physical represention. Bankers control the world bc they are smart and figured out they can own the governments around the world and make the rules of the game as they see fit.

Cool, now I can simultaneously see 24 charts of failure

Price Manipulation... some exchanges are clearly incentivized

It's not my bad if you can't think 
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:02:43
Hilarious that you think TA is actually applicable to a market with no regulation or oversight. People like you lose money hand over fist, and what's worse is that you spread your ignorance as a perceived authority.

@_date: 2018-11-11 06:54:27
Yeah. Compare BTC to the lightbulb or videogames. Seems about the same. 
Seriously you guys need to get in touch with reality. It was a massive pump and dump and a handful of cockfucks stole millions from ignorant idiots. Charlie Lee, Brian Armstrong, Ver, the ripple fucks...binance.. all got stupid rich. Good Day traders won. Everyone else who bought in 2017 got fleeced and I hope we get another pump and dump so I can get out.
 
The game is far more rigged in crypto than in USD. There is ZERO oversight

litecoin + atomic swaps + litepay
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:35:15
It's about getting fleeced by algos in a purposely unregulated market. The banks are laughing all the way home
