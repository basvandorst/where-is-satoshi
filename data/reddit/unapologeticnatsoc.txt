Oh, I've been on the site since its inception, but frequently get annoyed by the stupid community standards, boorish snobs, and influx of idiots with persecution complex.   
Fact of the matter, is I'd love to debate politics honestly, but doing so requires addressing subjects which are taboo... which means that I get banned unless I fall into lock-step with the far-left narrative.   
... and if you're in a deep red state, and still ragging on conservatives, maybe you should try understanding them instead of judgmentally attempting to swing around your progressive dong?

Lefties don't get ejected from twitter, conservatives do. They know their audience is all.

top kek.

... lefties build bubbles, eject conservatives, and then accuse conservatives of refusing to leave their bubble. You do know that conservatives are happy to engage, but all the guidelines, defunding, and censure prevents us from doing so, right? It's why I've been through a dozen reddit accounts, and you haven't.
I keep getting banned for existing, you don't.
God damn lefty hypocrites.
... and when you create an under-class of disenfranchised people, yeah, they'll get more extreme, duh.

\&gt;"You're wrong and if you disagree, then you're an idiot"
and lefties wonder why they have such a hard time endearing themselves to \*literally every one.\*
I know how how you feel about learning.  My first election, I voted for Obama. But as I got older, experience, life without a support network, and upper education etc. I realized that I was being sold a bill of goods, but nothing of value. Real value comes from my people, not from a culture of materialistic narcissism.

I think they need to be able convert to USD to pay for server costs on a monthly basis.... they WERE working with coinbase for this.

Yep... there are more right extremists, because all supporters of free expression have been labeled nazi right wing extremists. When you call every one who disagrees with you a 'nazi' you'll be amazed by the number of nazis you find.

Liberal totalitarianism is cancer.

You are also cancer.

I've been banned from no less than 4 subs, only one of which have I posted in (doing so politely and on-topic), and the other 3 just banned me when I subscribed to the sub. So yeah, having a (non-left) political affiliation at all does immediately prevent you from engaging with entire communities. This is a moral puritanism created by the modern Left.
  
Lefties are very good at thinking they're morally justified in committing horrible acts in the name of the 'greater good' just like stalin, mao, and che all did.  However they cry out about injustice should they ever be on the receiving end of their own policies.  
If we create a world of tribal politics, especially now that central bankers can't cut service to individuals based on political alignment, my team is going to win, because we support freedom of thought.

Dude, clearly you're a lefty extremist. Your the kind of cancer that would destroy cryptocurrency because you can't control who gets funded and how. Leftists are all about centralized control, what they're doing on cryptocurrency subs, I have no idea.
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:31:28
Yes. hate speech is free speech.  
Any one who disagrees wants to govern how people are allowed to think. You cannot control how I think, you cannot control how I speak, and thanks to crypto, you cannot control with whom I engage in transactions.  
You're on the sub which makes totalitarian thought control impossible, mate.

I keep saying this to lefties that I kick out of my establishments, but they never seem to agree with you guys when they're on the receiving end. Like the bakery that refused to bake 'the gay wedding cake' in whose favor the US supreme court recently ruled.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:46:39


Yeah actually, it was weird.


You are clinically retarded mate. You can't stop the backlash, especially now that it's impossible to cut off funding. I always find it weird that moralizing totalitarians subscribe to this subreddit. The content of this sub literally makes their world view impossible to implement.

Really anything can be used to launder money, BTC is closely watched right now, making it a non\-ideal medium.
