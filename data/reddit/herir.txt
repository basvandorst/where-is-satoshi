Does anyone know why Visa is doing this? Were there any events that compelled them to close Bitcoin Visa debit cards? Or special laws, regulations? I searched but haven't seen anything official (except the usual "Bitcoin investment is very risky, yada, yada"...)

Tx. Im also about to get trezor. Delivery in march is loooong. Can you have altcoins like monero , verge or zclassic in trezor? Also does it support hard forks? I'm asking because I've got a bit of zclassic and there's supposed to be a fork spoon

Nice ! I didn't know about it. Glad I picked up Trezor :)

Does that mean that the IRS and other tax agencies are secretly reaching out to VISA/MasterCard and advising them to stop issuing Bitcoin backed VISA prepaid cards?

Curious, apart from BTC, what's the other altcoin you strongly believe in?
I'm mostly BTC + eth
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:49:52
Trezor or Ledger nano or other hardware wallet?

Faucet: 
Wallet : 
Of course these are on testnet and worthless but you can do all operations like on mainnet

you could have negative interest rates

Which country is it. South Korea ?

this would be good - can't wait to buy more BTC at discounted price

What about getting a gaming PC with a few high end graphic cards . The noise will be much lower, youll be able to run it 24/7, you can make Bitcoin with nicehash and it also has good resale value. I have one in my living room and haven't turned heating on

Congrats ! Not sure if you've seen it, but have you seen the ideas of tracking diamond and precious metals origin with blockchain and public ledger ? So buyer can be 100% sure their diamond comes from a clean source for example

Amazed that you've been able to code this single-handedly. And Love the idea, although I've never traded oil or other. I'm curious, what would it take for this to include stocks like Amazon/Netflix/Tesla or other metals like lithium/cobalt?
My idea is less trading and more like using this to diversify holdings. So for example, if I have too much Bitcoin and I believe Bitcoin is going to decrease in short term, I can exchange a few for Netflix shares or a metal that I think is more promising in growth than BTC (and then revert those to Bitcoin when I want to "cash out")

I think it's sarcastic

My rule is that once it's more than a paycheck, then move it to a hardware wallet. I'm not saying that coinbase could be hacked but in the crypto world, there's a paltorm that gets hacked every couple of weeks

Well this is a good problem to have, it means there's a lot of interest for your website, now you just have to scale it up. Get bigger servers and make the code production-proof. You can even print the errors and the whole comments and show it to other people, maybe they would invest $$ in the project given the interest
