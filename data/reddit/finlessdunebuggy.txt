You must be a blast at parties

Negative, like your attitude. Thanks again OP

I dont think you understand my joke, you were offering to buy at a 40% increase of its current value at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:00:40
Thank you OP, I will pass this along to friends and family

Don’t blame my response for your inability to tell a joke

In that case I’ll sell you my bitcoin for $9000, that’s a  10% discount

That’s like saying Henry Ford is the only person who can patent the design of a car

Take it as a learning experience and HODL, it will get there just have patience 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:40:39
Yes, yes it is.

Was only valid that day, at this current day I’d be willing to separate for $14,000

Dang I missed my only chance to buy in November of 2010
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:48:42
I’m with you. Even after all the FUD, Bitcoin is technically up 5% since last month with a lot of head room for growth at this point. My plan is HODL and buy low!

If you’re consistently losing on your short term trades, you could try another strategy like 75% value in long term holdings and use 25% of your value for day trading. It will reduce your swings if you choose wisely. I like to remember that I’m not smarter than the market so I shouldn’t try to play it. Long term holdings bought at optimal levels is almost always the best strategy for the average person

^^ exactly. Save yourself the trouble, buy and hold your own bitcoin and you’ll be better off.
