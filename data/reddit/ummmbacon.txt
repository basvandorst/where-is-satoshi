So they made them as something funny to send to customers or they made them to make fun of customers internally?  The difference is pretty huge.

Really nothing because it is specific to the SHA-256 hash.  So if you have anything that does SHA-256 then you can use it for that, but otherwise it is pretty useless.

It can drop back down, just not very likely.  But assuming prices remain relatively low then it would no longer be feasible for some to keep older/slower machines online.  If their were a number of these dropping off it *could* lower the difficulty.  
For example on this chart [here]( it shows a projected drop.  I don't expect that to actually happen but it isn't impossible.
