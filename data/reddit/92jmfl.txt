I see some flaws. 
1: Houses are crazy expensive, if they are single how can you expect them to afford a house on their own? Surely investing and saving whilst living with parents is the most efficient method? 
2: 'Normal social life' - what do you class as normal? I can assume you would totally disagree with my social life (I like cars: Car shows, car events, track days, driving places, road trips and random photo/video shoots).

Awesome! Thanks

Still around £350 gbp. I want the cheap shit I'm seeing on coinbits.

Dropbox isn't quite the same as photostream. I also use dropbox and it doesn't allow full Rez images, it compresses them and stores them online. As much as I dislike apples way of doing things I haven't found any alternative to iPhoto for a PC or photostream for a phone.

My family loved the bitcoin I gave them along with custom made cards explaining how it works, how to redeem it etc. When more family joined us in the evening they wanted some coin so I ended up giving away another £20 to extended family and my step bro in law called me the next day to buy some from me! Christmas is about personalised gifts, not just items made in sweat factories by chinese people to give to people to make you feel you contributed. I'd rather give some bitcoin than a shitty tie.

I won't lie, I'm quite tempted but I'm from the UK. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:40:25
Don't feel bad, i also turned down a huge number of coins, I'm in my 20s with nothing to my name. Goodluck. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:53:43
I'm really confused, how can gox make a fake bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:13:57
I want to switch but I have loads of apps I've purchased through the app store, about £50 worth. I love photo stream, how I can download my DSLR shots to iPhoto and it appears on my phone and tablet. Cant do that on an android.

How can I buy BTC at this huge crash? Bittylicious still has them for £400 in the UK! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:14:50
I know I'll probably get downvoted big time or even worse abused by the bitcoin community but how do we KNOW that BTC wasn't set up by 'satoshi' with him knowing it would interest people, he sets this all up with minimal cost keeping rediculous numbers of coins for himself so when the price rises, he sells, becomes a billionaire or whatever and thats it. So basically a big, well planned pyramid scheme.. People have done worse to get rich? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:57:46
No problemo, I am a man of my word and you have saved my ass for christmas presents! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:02:38
I think I love you. 
If only I didn't have to buy a new back tyre yesterday - I'd buy 0.2 right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:59:37
What country are you in to have that law? I'm sure the price will rise - this is probably the FBI and those stolen coins being sold bringing the price down. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:01:53
You have 11k BTC? I wish I had mined when I first heard about them. I had 0.03 but I've been giving small ammounts to friends to get them started in the idea. One of them went out and bought £80 worth after I gave him £1! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:56:15
I will be, I need to make a wallet tonight and I'm going to buy around 20k from a fellow redditor. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:48:15
Thats actually a really good point! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:42:47
Can this happen to BTCs stored through apps like block chain? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:22:02
Approx 0.0001btc 
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:51:35
Yay! I'm now a millionaire.. 
I wish I had more than 0.025 BTC
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:58:54
Me too! Damn. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:55:15
I offered GBP.. Thats different from USD right? 
The reason I didn't offer BTC is like everyone else, down to the volatility, that 0.02btc could be worth £5 or £50, I didn't want to insult him nor overpay him! 
Scrolling down, I now realise that [ is... beautiful?...

I've had very small payouts from  for watching videos. Only around 10p in value but its free coin! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:32:51
What if we could mine bitcoin as an xbox game.. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:49:12
Not exactly a pyramid but that is regularly what people say to me when I try to defend BTC I don't know how to answer back to that acusation. (didnt until i saw these posts atleast) 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:43:05
I want dogecoins!! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:54:12
Thats awsome! Not sure about people saying $100, but I'm from the UK and would pay around £20 for one of those.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:09:26
You should totally say you didn't receive it.. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:51:32
Its a little morally wrong if you invent a currency yet keep loads of it and get personally loaded.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:58:30
I won't deny, I'm a little jealous reading this, but I agree with exactly what you are saying. The price isn't a problem, just as long as you get in and have some coin. I had 0.03 (gave some away to friends to get them started with BTC) and it's dropped down to £10 worth, but it doesn't matter! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:55:00
I cannot belive this is real.. Can someone explain and give proof this is real?
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:33:49
I guess eventually when BTC settles down (Which is wont if people treat it as stocks like they are) then we can start using BTC as a value rarther than a method of transferring value. 
Sorry, I was just playing along as everyone who mentioned Mpkomara got some uBTC! Still a newbie here. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:07:11
That would be really nice! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:37:35
No one haas mentioned the most obvious to me. How the hell am I suppose to remember my wallet address?! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:45:02
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:46:08
I feel like an idiot - how are we in control? by we do you mean coin holders or miners? how come we can't 'reactivate' lost coins if we have the power to block coins? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:50:15
I'm worried about giving them financial advice to buy them which is why I gave them around £1 each to get them started and see how it works. I really want more but MtGox takes forever to verify and I don't feel comfortable sending over my personal details. Don't suppose you know where else I can get some at a good price in the UK? Faucets don't exactly pay much out! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:50:12
I see your point, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:13:19


So I've gone to bitaddress and it gives me the left (public) and right (private)
I can print that off along with the QR codes and put together a custom card in photoshop but I really don't understand how to then 'import' the funds to use them. For example, I use blockchain on my phone which is my 'bank account' I can send and receive BTC - how does this work with the paper based wallets? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:24:37
Damn. This is awesome. Just bought 0.1BTC. keep going lower. I want it down to £5 a coin on friday.. I'll buy as much as I can! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:09:11
Same for me, only it was close to 100,000 if I remember rightly. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:24:58
Okay, so I'm a computer programmer and want to make some money. I program the idea of bit coin and spread the word as far as I can, mining as much as I possibly can with my current funds, get more people, publicity and people buying the coin until the price rises so much, so I sell a little here and there keeping the value from crashing too far making myself a multi multi millionaire through other people's fiat money. Some early adopters who helped me also get super rich through my idea.. I use 'fuck the govt and their money' promotions to get more people involved and write a big back story about money not being real even though my made up coin isn't real to get people scared of fiat, I invent an idealism which people want to be part of as people don't want to be sheep..  it was invented purely to rob other people of their wealth.. 
Doesn't sound too far fetched in my opinion. (This isn't what I believe, just a thought I had which concerned me) 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:39:23
Thank you so much, once I learn to use the bit coin tip I'll remember your name! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:17:36
I honestly think it was either 100k or 10k back in late 11 for payment on ebay.. I passed it off as nonsense stupidly. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:00:21
You are an awesome dad. Wish my parents taught me like this. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:11:31
Money isn't the issue, I just want a bit coin tip to say I've had one, I'm trying to convince my friends to get on the coin and faucets don't really provide much. Although I wouldn't say no to 1000btcs if you are offering. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:34:28
Posted in an earlier thread:

Which really isn't THAT much money.. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:44:17
Can someone ELI5 how this works with public and private keys? I want to make some paper wallets but how do I stop the BTC being stolen and when I want to spend it, how do I import it to my wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:53:23
Thank you for your thorough answers, I will now be able to answer my friends and family who doubt BTC. This answer should be linked in an FAQ! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:27:57
I've seen people link in a screen showing the transaction, i can't remember the site, think it may have been coin base but I've read so much about BTC all the websites are becoming the same in my head! 
Another redditor has since explained that it wasn't real. I couldn't belive someone would send 1000USD to a randomer through the internet! Sorry for being so gullable. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:13:05
I really don't want bitcoin tied or advertised to any religion personally. Bitcoin is meant to be a neutral currency everyone should want to use, not aimed at specific groups of people. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:49:58
I knew it was open source but are you saying eventually if enough miners decided, they could start a different blockchain? Or do you mean other coins could be the defacto currency?
