It is a shame that the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin is a climate change denier.

Great, we have a citizen of the United States incapable of reading, putting facts together, and forming an opinion.  I am guessing you don't have an opinion on Bitcoin too right.  You seem like you are incapable of reading, putting facts together and making any kind of judgement.

History will show that Rand Paul denied and thusly post poned any advancement in combating one of the biggest issues facing human existence.  He is thusly the worst person to ever to be used to advertise something like Bitcoin.  "Hey you guys should get involved in Bitcoin,  Rand Paul started accepting it"

Climate change denier
Rand Paul: "The science is not conclusive"  False.  The science is conclusive.  He is just denying the science. 
"I am not sure anybody exactly knows why" False.  Scientists know that CO2 emissions plays a big part in climate change.  He denies that anybody has a clue what is going on.
Here he is on Television uttering what I quoted.
There are people who blow the problem out of proportion and there are people who do the exact opposite.  He denies there is a problem and he halts any type of progress on troubleshooting the issue.  He is a failure and any American that defends him is a failure. 
Now to address how to handle the issue without harming the economy is definitely a conversation to have.  But we won't have that until people stop denying we have the issue in the first place.
