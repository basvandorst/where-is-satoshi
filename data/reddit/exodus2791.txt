Just because this sub didn't show it, doesn't mean that every other sub or related forum also didn't.
I'm on two other exchanges besides Coinbase and both show a BCH increase within the last few days after the API information came out. As well as the spike on the day. 
It's glaringly obvious that the API information started the ball rolling.

You didn't specify currency.
It hit $AU 26,500 last week. :P

Well done idiot. You drew T_D to the sub.

Yes, I understand this. I just disagree with your definition of 'violating trust'. 
I don't consider hedging their bets and letting the market (users) decide as a violation of trust. I see it as trying to prepare for whatever the market (users) decide on.

Putting aside the 'attack or not' stuff. From what I understand we get free B2X coins of the same quantity of our existing BTC. Actual prices may stay the same, fall, rise... The new one may tank and existing BTC stays the same.
The beauty of a volatile market. ��

A business acting like a business and hedging its bets to not lose on either outcome is the enemy. Cool.

They are a business though. It's a whole different set of priorities.

I've noticed that people go full retard over the smallest things in this sub. Can you imagine what it was like for someone new to wander in here over the last couple of weeks?

Then we find out that we have to transfer somewhere else if we ever want to cash out :-/

Exactly. Keeping a cool head and examining things is obvious.
I may be new to bitcoin and I understand that there were issues with this new fork (I also think that it sounds like a bad idea). But there's a difference between opposing something and going full retard like some have been doing.
