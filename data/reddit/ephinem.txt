@_date: 2018-01-05 07:18:42
Any stories at least lol btw dont trust sears they are a sketchy store trust me
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:52:54
Great team behind it and loyal believers. Also there’s big announcement coming soon from their team this February. Lots of potential 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:36:32
Buy lisk! And check on it in 3 months. Don’t kill me if I’m wrong tho 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:36:06
It’s normal. Happened to me too it takes a while. Eth and LTC transfer quicker.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:36:02
Yeah don’t worry it takes some time 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:02:11
What do you consider large amounts?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:35:10
I read that companies usually sell right away but I would think steam would be different 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:45:46
It shows if you didnt mess up the address. Took like 15 hours that time tho lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:41:10
When does it air?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:04:35
I’m new are you saying it’s good to buy rn
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:12:18
Most likely not
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:22:47
That was such a cringe worthy video lol. I would’ve sold my btc if I had any at the time cause of him.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:24:56
I️ think we’ll skip every number leading up to 10k
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:59:59
Yes sir
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:32:31
Great video bud
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:45:52
I thought he was holding information from us like if it was a puzzle 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:20:59
If you’re successful remember me pls
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:38:00
Omg I just got it
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:16
Got it
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:34:28
No when I️ transfer I️ understand why it takes a while but if I️ buy exchange one crypto for another it takes very long for some reason.
Edit: brb let me update this mess
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:09:40
Aren’t we paying taxes after turn it into fiat
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:17:22
I know it’s probably a stupid question but I’m kinda confused 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:37:44
Probably cashed them out as soon as they got it
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:22:43
What price you trynna pay?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:37
Lol this is how it goes.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:49:15
We’re good guys
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:02
They’re mine
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:48:27
I understand why psychologically is nice to own one bitcoin but there’s not much of a difference from owning .99 of a bitcoin. You invest as much as you can and always stay ready to buy. I wish I would’ve bought more when it dipped but I didn’t. I bought at 6500 tho and I’m satisfied because in the near future we’re gonna be seeing crazy numbers and realize that the difference between 5k and 8k is nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:47:11
Now I waiting for the dip to buy more 8k will be here by Tuesday probably 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:31:04
What ? Lmao why would you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:43:47
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:37:23
This is r/bitcoin so I’m not gonna get too much into it but look into other cryptos if you wanna try your luck and maybe make some crazy profits
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:13:36
I can’t see how putting your dirty money in banks is a good idea. Plus if it’s money you don’t need why not invest it in the future of currency? Don’t think anyone here will disagree.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:34:12
What you said is kinda obvious yet not enough people practice this. I’m guilty of not doing this all the time 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:53:52
Coinbase is not bad if you’re thinking long term and have a wallet to keep your btc safe. However gdax is literally the same thing minus the annoying fees and it’s great for trading. Watch a couple of videos on how to use gdax to avoid fees it’s worth it
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:21:25
I want this one in a T-shirt 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:22:32
I’m trying My best to educate myself on the market but I️ have no idea what this post means and who’s roger 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:42:39
That’s wishful thinking but anything is possible 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:01:56
I use gdax and would recommend it to everyone. I also use Bittrex to buy alt coins occasionally but that’s pretty much it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:15:39
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:47:46
Happened to me. Took about a day and there was no sign of anything happening but soon enough it showed up. I️ missed some opportunities during the wait but I️ was just happy to seen my btc.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:35:51
We are disappointed in you
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:23:23
Redditor for 2 days lmao
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:01:43
Are you the guy in blue?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:48:20
Exactly these is what I do.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:43:55
There’s ways to have it transferred to fiat as soon as the payment is completed 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:37:38
If it is the future then absolutely but the certainty of the IF is what drives the price up or down
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:07:36
220 million is nice pocket change 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:06:29
I️dk why everyone keeps thinking you need a whole bitcoin. When you invest in Apple you don’t buy the whole company. And yes man jump on board.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:39:32
Yeah I just copied it 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:43:00
Do a bank transfer to coinbase and transfer the cash to gdax and buy there. No fees at all and very easy to use. Watch a video on how to avoid fees using gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:48:15
Perfect timing 
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:15:14
Got it 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:21:43
I was browsing the sub while watching the game and saw everyone holding a sign and thought about doing the same thing you did. I’ve seen people do it before but I felt like it was such a coincidence that it happened as soon as I thought about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:42:15
Ohhh so this is all happening cause of you ?
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:54:38
Respect the deceased pls
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:44:47
You guys really tore that title apart
