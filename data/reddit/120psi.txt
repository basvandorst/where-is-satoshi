Posts like yours are what makes me want to close out my crypto positions.

Most people here talk about doubling down, but they aren't literally doing it; rather they are  lowering their cost basis.
The strategy is known as Martingale and typically is used on a 50/50 bet.

"on sale" only can apply for a commodity or equity that has some ability to be valuated 
Bitcoin isn't one of those things (at this time)

He's not the CEO.  He isn't even on the BOD any longer.

"""In fact, “There weren’t that many people involved and the economic repercussions were pretty minor,” Goldgar says. “I couldn’t find anybody that went bankrupt. If there had been really a wholesale destruction of the economy as the myth suggests, that would’ve been a much harder thing to face.”
That’s not to say that everything about the story is wrong; merchants really did engage in a frantic tulip trade, and they paid incredibly high prices for some bulbs. And when a number of buyers announced they couldn’t pay the high price previously agreed upon, the market did fall apart and cause a small crisis—but only because it undermined social expectations."""
Actually that doesn't sound too far off.

I posted this link in a reply farther down, but I'll post it again here.
It's a case study of GTAT, a company that everyone though would only go up, but instead it went bankrupt.  You can watch the chaos unfold on an internet forum the morning when trading is halted.

That's often called "Going out of business" in my experience.

And even if it were true, there is nothing you can do about it because there are no regulations around market manipulation of cryptocurrencies.

80% drop is a dip.

If you feel bad about it, you have too much of your net worth allocated to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's ledger can be hacked / broken if a party owns a majority of mining.

Good old pump and dump, except it's legal in an unregulated space.

Also, as of a few days ago, people can hold short positions via futures.
Also, there are no regulations to protect against insider trading or collusion.
Anyone holding long/short positions in BTC signed up for the soap opera of bullshit whether or not they realized it.

Given that my purchase was in 2014 and I realized ~1000% returns, not really.

Thank you for clarifying my initial post.
A good case study of improper exposure can be found by here 
Many people put far too much into GTAT as they were supposed to be a supplier of sapphire to Apple.  You can see what happened in the link.

Like most speculative things, a good idea is to set a reasonable exposure as % of your portfolio.  When Bitcoin got near $10000, I sold half of my holdings to maintain the % exposure I'm comfortable with.

Hindsight is 20/20, especially with markets.

Some of us would like to retire modestly if BTC goes to 0, thank you very much.

Long Island Iced Blockchain anyone?

Sounds like a pump and dump operation
Which is of course not illegal in the land of crypto.  Sigh.
