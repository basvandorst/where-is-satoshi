I'm not the biggest fan of Tone Vays, but your comment is incredibly disingenuous. You realize a huge part of trading is adapting to new information, right? Taking something someone said while omitting everything they said after that is a little ridiculous, don't you think? By mid January he was already saying that we were in a bear market, and bitcoin could go as low as $2k.

Yeah, posts like these make bitcoin seem like a ponzi.

That’s typically what you do when you invest your fiat in something...

You think bitcoin’s price drop is 100% related to futures, and not the fact that it went from $1000-$20000 the year before, or that it’s a wildly speculative asset in a period of instability and uncertainty in global markets?

Shorting an asset means you're making money by it going down instead of up. So you could buy $100M of bitcoin OTC (which doesn't effect the spot market price,) short $100M (or more) of bitcoin in the futures market to hedge that $100M of bitcoin, then sell your spot bitcoin, which would drive the price down. You're selling along the way down, and when you're finished selling, the price of bitcoin will very likely be lower since you sold a significant amount on the open market, and since there isn't enough demand to keep up. You could then cover most of your futures shorts at a profit (most likely.)

Ever heard of a sell the news event?
But sure, despite the CME futures having less volume than even a small exchange like Coinbase, they’re definitely the ones dictating the price of bitcoin. 
Believe whatever you want bud.

Basically, the less liquid an asset is, the easier it is for less money to move the price.  SPY (the S&amp;P 500 ETF) is one of the most liquid assets in the world, and $1M wouldn’t even move it 0.01. If someone were to market sell $1M of bitcoin(~300btc) on an exchange, it would move the price significantly more because the orderbooks are thinner.   So if someone wanted to move the price up or down, it would require a lot less capital on bitcoin than other assets with higher liquidity.

Fingers were pointed by Firano, who was the founder of the exchange and extremely shady.  He willingly allowed withdrawals for weeks, knowing that there were critical bugs in the process that allowed you to withdraw more funds than you deposited.

Sure, so the volume yesterday (Jan. 28) of the contracts expiring in February (most people typically trade the ones expiring that month, since they have the most volume) was 4345 contracts. Each contract is 5 bitcoin, so the volume yesterday was effectively 21725 bitcoin. You can find the volume of individual exchanges on their websites, or charting sites like tradingview. To put the 21.7k btc of volume into perspective, binance did 40.4k btc yesterday, bitmex did \~467k btc ($1.6B USD), and coinbase did 13.8k btc.

I mean mount gox happened. It terms of a btc specific bug I’m not sure, I don’t know enough of the early history. I think you’re misinterpreting what I said though, I’m fairly sure that the bitgrail hack was 100% on the exchange and had nothing to do with nano.
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:30:10
 That’s the volume on the CME futures, each contract is 5 bitcoin. You can also search btc under the futures heading on tradingview to see longer timeframes. I exaggerated a bit by saying it’s similar to Coinbase, but it’s rarely ever close to the larger exchanges like bitmex, binance, etc.

Depends on what you mean by back and forth. If you’re talking about wash trading, it’s impossible to say, but I’m sure that’s a lot of the smaller exchanges’ volume, or the the newer ones that have spiked for no reason. If you’re talking about traders trading then between themselves, that’s the same thing as localbitcoins.

No, anyone who went margin long near the top would’ve already been liquidated. We’ve already dipped to 5.8k, meaning anyone who even 2x’d 11.6k or higher would’ve been liquidated already. The margin longs that are closing now are likely the ones that opened in the low 6k’s over the last few weeks.

It is a scam. They wouldn’t be selling mining services to people if they could make more from mining themselves.
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:35:06
The volume across all exchanges is usually $5-$10 billion/day. An extra $2.5M from here is a drop in the bucket.

While it’s certainly very interesting and you’re using the correct variables, I’d question what energy cost you use in your calculations. A lot of miners are in third world countries or have deals with their energy providers where they can get it for extremely cheap. Most of last year, people were able to mine a bitcoin for less than $3k/coin, some far less. If you’re just trying to show what it would cost to mine in a first world country, that’s fine, but you should specify that(or at least the benchmark rate you’re going off), since it’s just not true that the average bitcoin is being mined for $6k/coin right now.

Well that is the bcash site right? Not exactly surprising that their defaults are to BCH.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:36:22
I didn’t understand how the platform works before I started using it, so it must be a scam! Here, I’ll link an example of another site that I think is a scam as well, even though there are very clear distinctions between BTC and BCH when transacting.
