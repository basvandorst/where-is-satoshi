There's a question that's been niggling me for a little over a year: in April '13, I disclosed a vulnerability to Coinbase (thanks for paying out so quickly!) and also sent in a resume. It was right as the Series A round news was hitting the press, and I could never get a response from Brian (even though he emailed me back, just previously, during the security disclosure). 
So now, I wonder what it would have been like to work at Coinbase during your meteoric rise over the last 18 months. Did you ever get my application? Did you just choose not to respond?

1) State how Bitcoin is both a payment network used to transfer bitcoins (a [fiat]currency/commodity/token), around. Make comparisons to PayPal being a network for USD, Square/Visa a network for USD, etc. I think this helps some people understand Bitcoin/bitcoins better. 
2) Don't get into deflation, I don't think it will go anywhere in 60mins (Hayekians may love it tho, who knows). At any rate, talk about how Visa and other current dominant payment networks extract a private tax of ~3% from all transactions. Bitcoin is disruptive because it removes that! Keynesians, et al., can agree on this fact!
3) It's a startup currency, and a big experiment, here is Gavin's take from oh-so-long-ago (in Bitcoin time):

Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek makes a powerful case that government involvement in providing a medium of exchange (money) is neither necessary nor beneficial. In fact, government provision of currency is a threat to both liberty and financial stability. Hayek points out that governments have everywhere and always undermined the value of their currencies to reap revenue through inflation. He argues, convincingly, that the best hope for sound money lies in competition amongst privately issued currencies.
Ergo, the government shouldn't issue the currency either. But who, then, shall issue the currency?

Yes, that was very comprehensible and clears up a lot of things up for me. So much so, my economic ideals are changing! I am still confused on one thing though, when you really got to the crux of the matter, IMO:


I would think people opting not to invest in this safe investment opportunity, and thereby sit on their money, would cause not a slowdown in deflation as you mention, but rather accelerate the deflation leading to the proverbial deflationary spiral. You don't give out loan -&gt; company can't buy stuff -&gt; stuff is cheaper -&gt; deflation is stronger. As deflation gets worse and worse, people will give out less and less loans for reasons aforementioned. It seems deflation has a positive-feedback mechanism rather than a desirable negative-feedback mechanism. Is this not the case? How is the negative-feedback (in prices) effected?

gold via in-person/USPS/futures-exchanges

Firstbits solve the security problem a bit. Read about them here: 
Really, addresses should only every be used once for a multitude of reasons, decrease transaction spam and using the blockchain as a messaging service. But for security reasons also because the encryption bit-depth of a unspent address is 160bits, as opposed to 128bits for a previously used address. 128bit encryption will stop being fully secure in ca. 2020.

AFAIK, transactions work like this:
Inputs: A list of addresses. 100% of the "unspent outputs" (the address balances) will be put into the transaction!
Outputs: A list of address with amounts. Once summed, these must be equal to or less than the inputs. Outputs may include input address (as "change"). sum(Inputs) - sum(Outputs) = transaction fee. 
Suppose A has 10 BTC and wants to send 5 BTC to B with a 1 BTC transaction fee. 
Inputs: A
Outputs: 5 to B and 4 to A
Now if you forget the 2nd output (4 to A in this case) then the transaction fee becomes 5BTC. I think this is what happened to you =(

Miners (or perhaps more correctly, the pool operators) can arbitrarily include any legitimate transactions (an illegitimate txn would be one which isn't properly signed). They can include no transactions, but are incentivized to include an transaction which includes a fee. 
With a transaction that is accepted for inclusion, you will wait a random amount of time, with a mean of 10 minutes, a median of 7 minutes, and the possibility of waiting much longer (with low probability). 
@_date: 2012-09-14 17:56:34
Thank you for the excellent post. I have two slightly off-topic -- perhaps naïve, definitely playing devil's advocate -- questions I was hoping you could answer:


1) Can savings be treated same way for both bitcoins and traditional currencies? Let's compare. The safest way to store bitcoins is individually-based cold storage: brain wallets, paper wallets, online wallets, etc. This is in contrast to traditional currencies where depositing at the bank is the most safe way (to prevent robbery, add insurance, etc). Because bitcoin-savings are cold and isolated, they are removed from the money supply, no? Traditional-savings are loaned out (let's assume full reserve banking) because you would keep them in CDs or other time-deposits, thus making loans available to grow the economy.
2) What is the incentive to lend in a deflationary environment? As we all know, the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. So during deflation, the real interest rate is even higher than the nominal interest rate. Say deflationary is at 5%, and some company wants to borrow at a real interest rate of 3%. Then their interest rate would be -2%; there's no reason to loan to them! You take on their default/credit risk, and lose 2% as compared to a brain wallet! But, on the other hand, suppose inflation is at 5%. Then you can easily loan to them at 8%, earning a real interest rate of 3%. I guess the first example has a company wanting to borrow at 3%, but the economy is growing at 5%, so economics works out to not give them a loan, but rather give someone else the loan! 
@_date: 2012-09-14 20:22:50
So to "crack an address," one must brute force publically-known information to get the private key for it. With just an address known, one must brute-force RIPEMD160 (with 160bits of security), but once a transaction is signed, the address and the public key are known and then one must "only" brute force SHA256 of the public key which has, effectively, 128bits of security.
[see here](
@_date: 2012-08-12 18:36:02
These sort of bets are called Credit Default Swaps or CDS. One can buy them on any bond, corporate bonds, sovereign (e.g., greece) bonds, etc. 
CDS prices are usually expressed in percent APR. For example, if you buy CDS on German bonds for 3% and hold German bonds which are returning 5%, then you will earn a garenteeded return of 2% (unless the issuer of the CDS fails...). The issuer earns 3% as long as Germany doesn't default.
Okay, so what the costs for protection on pirate? Right now CDS on BCTST costs about 7.3%/week to buy and 4.7%/week to sell. If the cost to buy CDS protection was below 7%, everybody would buy it, because you can deposit money with BTCST and buy protection and get a guaranteed profit! Conversely, if selling CDS protection earned you more than 7%, people would sell CDS instead of investing with pirate (because you're earning more money for the same risk of BTCST defaulting!). Hence, these prices are appropriate for a wide range of probabilities of BTCST default, and not much can be deduced from the prices.
**TL;DR: The prices for buying or selling default protection on BTCST are appropriate if the market considers default chance is high or low**

Difficulty readjusts every 2016 blocks. That means at most 50400 BTC could be mined before difficulty readjusts. If these were instantly mined and sold as market orders with the current bid-depth at Mt Gox, this would take the price to 17$.

Stop loss orders can only add to the volatility (and generally lower the expectation value of return). At their core, they are a trend-following strategy, meaning small perturbations become amplified by stop-loss orders, leading to increased volatility.

Loans are how leverage works -- always. In your Forex example suppose you go long EURUSD 10:1 with 1000$. You borrow 9000$, buy 10,000$ worth of EUR. Et voila, you're 10:1 long EURUSD. Then when you close the trade, you buy USD using EUR and pay the USD loan back. 
It's the same thing for leverage with BTCUSD. There is always, necessarily, borrowed money to engage in leveraged trading.

Yes, blockchain.info can mix several thousand BTC in a few days. I would recommend doing it in 1000BTC chunks, waiting for one to "clear" (read: fully process) before sending the next batch.
Bitcoinfog is another option, although their mixing paradigm isn't as strong as blockchain.info's
