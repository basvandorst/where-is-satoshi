But don't all the transactions from these exchanges cause the flow of BTC hence liquidity? Less flow of the BTC would prove more demand and hence raise value.

Gotcha, just trying to valuate FV of BTC because everytime I say it won't go higher, I am wrong. I have been seeing price targets that are high enough that getting in now would be a good investment. 
edit: Also the "untraceable" aspect (and it is advertised as such) for these crypto-currencies, in my mind, leads on a negative connotation. Well not necessarily "negative", but a darker connotation.

Agreed, but do you think the fact there is a finite amount has anything to do with this and why it could possibly be up 100,200 maybe even 300% from now? Once they are all mined that is.

So are you saying there is no relationship with liquidity and demand lol?
edit: Also, I guess to elaborate on my thoughts, people buying and selling these BTC could be for transactions on the DNM. So if these purchases that are causing supply to lower are going to be used for transactions on the DNM, then my point would be valid. 
A decrease in transactions on DNM -&gt; Less buying -&gt; More Supply -&gt; Less Demand -&gt; Lower Value (may be a stretch)

I'm having trouble following your tone. You are saying this would be a good thing correct?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:26:20
Let me try to explain it more clearly, I am not trying to estimate the likeliness of these events. I know these will never happen, I was merely using it to be able to formulate an answer of the correlation to the DNM and BTC liquidity. I could say what if DNM stopped using BTC and started using another crypto-currency etc. It would have the same end effect (which is what I'm trying to understand).

I was hypothetically speaking. I was curious more on the Dark Net Market's effect on BTC, not what would happen if they all got shut down. That was just a parameter to use to possibly explain the correlation.

Elaborate? I have a credit card AND bank account hooked to my coinbase account. Both approved. I went and verified the amounts in my bank account that they deposited. Credit card is Instant purchase, and there is plenty of money available on my credit card.

yeah, I have no funds currently in Gemini, so I'm looking at atleast another 4-5 business days with either a wire or transfer from account.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:52:29
yeah, that's my biggest worry. but my daily limit isn't dropping either.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:07:42
I do have a gemini account. Wasn't sure how to do instant buy
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:49:57
oops, I'm sorry. Coinbase. Everything is set up correctly. Credit Card (instant).
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:05:19
no record of the transactions, but i clicked "Confirm amount" and it said Successful, then no transaction record and 0.00 in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:10:13
I just purchase more BTC, and it said purchase successful, BTC will be in your wallet instantly. Still nothing and no transaction history
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:31:59
what'd I do wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:11:24
All 3 were cancelled????
