If your investments grow faster than your interest rate, it would be dumb to cash them all out at once to pay off the mortgage. 
Debt isn't necessarily bad.
Borrow at 2% invest in something that makes 4% and bang, free asset.

Think about it this way, people spend that kind of money getting a BMW over a Hyundai and at the end of the day they depreciate just the same and that money never comes back, and some people drink that much in a year as well or spend it on going out to eat or whatever their hobbies are

My point is that for all all practical purposes the Hyundai what do everything the BMW will do for about one-fifth of the price not to mention cheaper insurance and maintenance. Some people will pay an extra 20 to $30,000 to have a special badge on the front or maybe a little bit better ride. 
Some people have no problem spending that kind of money for a status symbol which is guaranteed to depreciate to nothing over time, where as your investment in Bitcoin has at least some  possible upside which is more than a lot of people who waste their money on luxury cars can say

I see what you are saying but do not entirely agree. I know that Elon Musk did not invent the Tesla, he had an idea for a concept and had other people actually do the design and inventing part. I think you are correct that this is how most Business Leaders are. I just think that Thomas Edison is a bit different because he literally claimed to have invented the things that other people invented. He never gave his workers credit and literally stole their ideas and claim them as his own.

Because he was an asshole and a thug. Nearly All of his so-called inventions were invented by his underlings and he quickly stole credit for the good ones and never adopted the bad ones so he could avoid looking unsuccessful.

I got in early enough I was able to use a bullshit name with almost no verification. As it should have been the whole time. Unfortunately now without sending them my entire credit report I can't buy or trade crypto. Which is fine for me, keeps me from selling. And by the time I'm ready to sell, I probably won't have to. That's the problem with coinbase, Once adoption happens they will be obsolete

Shorting, or day trading, is a sucker's game and over 90% of people lose their money on it. Plenty of people who sold out at the high of $1,500 that are waiting for it to dip so they can buy back in because their "technical analysis" said it would.
