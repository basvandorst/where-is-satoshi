The market decides. In theory you could buy a whole bitcoin for 1 dollar. You just have to find someone that is willing to sell you at that price.
The same applies practically to everything else. Gas, Food, Houses, services, drugs, stocks, commodities etc.

Trump is smart and I think that he understand and maybe even like bitcoin. Since he knows that  half of the world is against him, by bashing bitcoin he is actually endorse it.

Bitcoin right now is about to get killed. If it drops from 13k I will sell everything and go for LTC/VTC/XMR/ETH.    
Almost at 300.000 unconfirmed tx and since we are having more than 5 tx/s it will only get bigger.   
Maybe if we had a 60% segwit adoption and LN it will revive and reclaim the &gt;80% market cap and all other altcoins will go down the toilet, but until then RIP BTC
Also I think that Bcash is a pump and dump scheme with no future before you start to downvote me

Every time that bitmain mine an empty block, someone transaction is not getting confirmed. This means that more babies are dying all over the world. This mean that more people are starving to death because they are not getting any confirmation to buy their food. People are falling sleep because they are not getting confirmations on their coffee. People are literally dying because of this. I am not exaggerating. This is a life  and death matter.

Bitpay has no reason to exist even if the fees were accurate.
The whole point of bitcoin is to be peer to peer and Bitpay is an intermediary on a peer to peer network. Bitpay also has geo-restrictions with defeat the whole purpose of borderless money.
If your merchant wants fiat, just pay them with fiat. If your merchant wants bitcoin, pay them directly with bitcoin.

Depends of the country. Chile for example, all the banks work under a system call "Transbank", so every wire between local Chileans banks are almost instant and free. International transactions could take days and are expensive.  
In Colombia this only works from accounts on the same bank. Local interbanks tx usually takes 2 - 3 working days and 10 - 14 working days for international tx.  
Bitcoin is a tool and as every tool works better on a context. It shines as a payment network when your payment is on risk to be censored, stopped midway trough or you, as a receiver, have concerns about fraud.
If you want to pass some money to your sister or coworker or spend it on a candy machine, at the moment is more faster and efficient to use fiat.  
  
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:42:21
Nop. If someone pays you, you can check on the blockchain with any online block explorer if the transaction was broadcasted. You only need to search for the address that you provided in any block explorer.
There is no need to have a "hot wallet" to check whether someone payed you.
Edit:  
look at this picture

Scanning the QR Code, you can check when was the last time that someone payed for a subway on that store, even if you dont know where that store is, or the private key of that address.
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:02:50
That is why I use linux.  
Also always double, triple or quadruple check your destination address. Some wallets has a preview of the tx that you are about to send.

Very early indeed.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:46:35
That is one of the issues of mainstream adoption of bitcoin. Some kid can lie to a customer of yours by showing his personal BTC address instead of the store address.
What I would do is having like a big poster with the name and logo of your store plus your QR code and add some disclaimer that says something like 
:Dear Costumer if you want to pay with bitcoin, please use the QR code of the poster in the counter. Do not send any bitcoin to any other address.

This is exactly the problem with the deluded cashies. They are not technical people so they dont understand the problem or since most of them are paid shills dont even bother to understand the current limitations of the system.    
What are the problems? Hard drive space is the lesser problem here    
1) Block propagation    
2) Block verification    
3) Attack blocks   
4) Less nodes jeopardize consensus    
5) Bandwidth    
6) Hard drive space

Also its bad that Tone and Saifedean forgot to mention that is impossible, under an hypothetical gold standard 2.0, to the normal people to audit or actually verify that the gold is stored safely in a vault somewhere.

a single 32 mb block crashed 33% of the BU nodes. This is the opposite of "work well"
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:35:13


That is what the core developers have done. Segwit was a block increase and the average block is around 1.2 MB with plenty of room to go to 1.4 MB or a even a little higher.
Look at ethereum, EOS, BCash and BSV. The first two have become so large that almost none is running nodes. BCH and BSV has experienced reorgs, high orphan rates, nodes crashing on big blocks and miner centralization.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:43:04
One point that the average big blocker dont see, its that the fee market acts like a negative feedback loop.  
Imagine that we increase the blocksize to make room to the normal volume + veriblock volume  
After that a new veriblock competitor arise. Lets call this new competitor, veriblock cash  
And again "We should" increase the block size to make room to veriblock + veriblock cash + organic volume
Repeat again, now a new "Veriblock SV" appears. And again "We should" increase the block size to make room to veriblock + veriblock cash + Veriblock SV + organic volume
Repeat again, now we have satoshidice, satoshibet, satoshirulette, GambleBTC, SatoshiCasino, pokerBTC (Made up names), all claiming and demanding blockspace for every single transaction/bet. Again, we should increase the blocksize again to make space for everyone.  
That is why a big blocker scheme will eventually collapse or converge to a single centralized server since there is infinite demand for blockspace and limited offering.
