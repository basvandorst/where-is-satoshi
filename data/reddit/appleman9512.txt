I don't think you can use funds that are pending like you can with Gemini. The only way you can purchase at today's price is if you place a buy order instead of a deposit. That way, you buy immediately, but can't sell or transfer Bitcoin until the fund clears.

you normally set it to below market price, or just set to to market price exactly.

I've transferred from GDAX to Cex before and it has taken anywhere between 30 minutes to 3 hours. Haven't tried Cex to GDAX yet.

Really good Reddit post linked below. Basically you're looking at maybe 15% of your gains going to taxes when you file.
Edit: changed to 15% based on OPs salary

No problem. Just gotta be patient with transfers. I've waited anywhere between 30 minutes and 4 hours for mine to get confirmed.

To clarify, yes you can buy, but it will be with new funds, not the funds that are pending.

Now if I could just get verified...I've never had such a hard time trying to give someone my money.

Since you already have a coinbase account, the quickest way would be to move money to gdax to buy crypto. Much cheaper to trade on gdax.

Simple math will do. 30,000 / 17,500 = 1.71. Multiply your $500 by 1.71 and you get $857.14 worth of Bitcoin if it hits 30k
