If you sell the fruit, you should.

Let’s say you have a garden. You spend $200 on the soil, materials, and seeds used to grow the fruit. You grow 25 watermelons and sell then for $10 each. Your profit is $50 and you owe like $20 in taxes. No big deal. 
If you should be paying enough in taxes such that you “actually care” about that amount of money, then you are exactly the type of person who should be paying taxes.

There is no designation between work and spare time. That is the problem with your argument. 
Tax is not a penalty, it’s a cost. 
If you don’t want to pay taxes, move to some place that doesn’t have any. I’m Armenian and a large chunk of my family lived in Syria for decades. They used to boast about how “my side” of the family was stupid for living here and paying taxes on everything.

And so really rich people who make money simply by investing don’t deserve to be taxed at all. 
Your an idiot.

I don’t want to argue with a fellow Armenian. We all have different views. Hachoghootyoon!!!

Losing over 60% of value is a pretty steep correction.

Well I think when it was growing slowly, it was an investment. The thing was slowly gaining confidence. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:47:42
Haha.

I think that correction is a bit of an understatement.

I think that it’s gonna drop below $1000

Bitcoin may go up. It may go down. But this volatility has turned it from an investment into a gamble. 
Doesn’t mean you can’t get lucky.
