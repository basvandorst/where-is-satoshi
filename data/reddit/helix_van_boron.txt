I feel like this is presumptuous. I mean, you're asking people to tip you for driving your own car. Bitcoin or not, that seems greedy. Do you actually expect people to get out of their cars and scan a QR code to give you money without providing them any sort of service?

So did I, but OP [said it's a private car]( Anyway, if it was a taxi wouldn't it make more sense to have it inside of the car?

They are exponential moving averages.
A simple moving average is just the average of the past n periods. (For example, a 9 day moving average is the current day's price plus the last eight days' prices, all divided by 9. Averages. Simple.) An exponential moving average is slightly more smooth and doesn't show as much n-period lag. An exponential moving average is calculated by taking the previous period's EMA and adding it to (the current period's price - the previous period's EMA) times a multiplier. This multiplier is a weighting factor, and is usually 2/(n+1) where n is the number of periods. So if you're looking at the D1 graph (each candle is one day), the blue line (EMA 21) is
Yesterday's EMA + (1/11) * (Today's price - Yesterday's EMA)
and the yellow line (EMA 9) is
Yesterday's EMA + (1/5) * (Today's price - Yesterday's EMA)
Lastly, EMAs are initially seeded with SMA, simple moving averages. This means that if you want a 9-day EMA, you have to wait 9 days until you can have a 9-day SMA, and then the next day you will calculate the EMA using yesterday's SMA.
I hope this all made sense.

I'm not entirely sure, but I believe a filled-in bar means that that particular period closed at less than it opened. Typically, a bullish candle graph is (from top to bottom) high, closing price, opening price, low, so a bearish (filled in) graph would be high, opening price, closing price, low. This is just a guess, though.

Can't we just call it "currency"? That's what we want it to be considered, after all. The extra adjectives are good for economists, but most people don't need to know them. By overusing terms like "digital" or "decentralized" we're making bitcoin seem more complicated than it needs to be. Money is complicated enough by itself, and most people usually ignore that. [I'm going to go US-centric here] You can use cash your entire life without having to learn how the Federal Reserve or the Treasury work. You just know that you have cash, it has value, and you spend it.
