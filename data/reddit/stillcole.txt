Can someone please explain? What is reference implementation?

Remindme! 1 month

Yeah of course something materially helpful and not meme based doesn't get any attention on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:39:30
But these aren't going to be implemented for a long time if I'm not mistaken. They aren't a near term solution to a problem that has already gotten severe

right so, coinbase probably looked at as the most promising implementer of segwit at this point, which would have the most significant impact on reducing fees. They have been dragging their feet however. They recently put out a memo basically stating that it isn't their  priority at this point and there are rumors that ownership/management has financial incentive to not implement it. 
Just my opinion but I think this is a bigger problem than people realize. Transaction fees are increasing unchecked. Fees will rise in step with volume/price and this is going to place a cap on how high btc will rise for the foreseeable future. Additionally it may allow an opportunity for alternative coins to gain a foothold. I would love if someone could tell me why I'm wrong though.

Shit I thought Gemini had adopted it

I mean the hard fork was abandoned last month right? For reasons that have yet to be addressed, suggesting that we likely wouldn't be able to reach a consensus once again if the idea of  a fork was introduced a second time
Are there any other alternatives to a hard fork which would ease transaction fees?

because larger blocks essentially require more hash power to process quickly. This means that miners and mining pools with stronger computers and more hash power would theoretically gain an advantage over smaller miners by being able to find blocks more effectively than them. Fewer miners = the potential for collusion.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:47:19
gotcha. My understanding was that there was massive pushback on the fork because larger blocks would be a move toward miner centralization. Accordingly it seems that there has been hardly any discussion about the road map or a properly done fork in the near future, since the last fork was abandoned. 
I think that everyone can agree that the goals of the fork are good but we are indeterminately far from reaching a consensus about when and how to implement it. As these fees continue to spike up though hopefully it motivates everyone to come back to the bargaining table

Can someone eli5 plz? 
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:54:40
Can someone please explain why they were dismissed  in the first place? It isn't clear from the link or this thread.

thats a really good question and I think a major reason why BCH has gained traction. BCH proponents essentially believe that segwit is good but just kicking the can down the road. The idea is that implementing segwit is good for things now but we will eventually face the same scaling issue later when things grow. Their argument is that simply ratcheting up the blocksize now puts the community in a better place to accommodate that growth. 
The consensus of the BTC community though is that scaling the blocksize up at a careful and reasonable pace is more prudent in the long term. They will scale up the block size, but in increments - mostly to avoid new coin hard forking off
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:02:46
gotcha thanks. And that would lead to my next question - what exactly is a mempool...?
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:07:54
yeah well fuck me for trying to understand right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:34:53
This makes the most sense out if anything I've read all day. Thanks for that. Where do you get your info out of curiosity? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:01:17
How does this work?
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:09:03
aren't faster block times related to the adoption of segwit though?
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:06:08
Can you elaborate.....? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:00:46
All really good points. You said a lot of stuff that is true and sadly does not get brought up when it's relevant enough 
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:20:43
sorry, can someone explain what this is, how it happened and why it's significant? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:20:26
how likely is it to succeed?
