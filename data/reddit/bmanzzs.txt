I suggest watching the latest [Bitcoin Group]( They have a wonderful discussion about it.

"It now only hold the title of worst bitcoin exchange in the world ran by a person with no people skills what so ever!"

I'm not buying this unless it smells exactly like bitcoin.

Because offloading onto the consumer means increase prices. Increased prices tend to turn off consumers. Get it?

Yeah... You should work on that.

Exchanges should not be regulated by the state, but by voluntary decentrazlied regulatory bodies that prove solvency on the blockchain by means of cryptography. There's absolutely no need for state intervention.

A favorite of mine:
*"I'm guessing that the people buying into this craze also have a pile of Beanie Babies sitting next to their "rare" Pokemon cards"*
If I got 0.00007934 bitcoin for every time someone compared Bitcoin to Beanie Babies...

I don't enjoy people making baseless claims.

A lot of exchanges have been doing that. It's not exactly a new concept.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:32:26
No problem! The Bitcoin Group is a great and incredibly informative show.

It's really frightening how threatened this community is. I mean, originally I loved all cryptos: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Dogecoin... Loved them all! Now, after reading sooo much biased uncalled for hate toward Dogecoin for apparently being an overly nice community? I'm stunned. I'm starting to realize how much a community matters. There's just so much hate here and in the litecoin subreddit. What did Dogecoin do? Raise money for the Jamaican bobsled team? Invite newbies to the crypto scene by tipping?  It's unbelieveable. I lost a lot of respect for this community after reading all of these uncalled for posts. Sheesh. Grow up, learn to like your little brother rather than disowning him. 
All this pointless arguing... How does this help promote cryptocurrencies at all? It doesn't. This is counter-productive.
I see phrases being thrown out like "fucking retarded", "dumbfuck kids", "idiots". And we're calling the dogecoin community immature? This is incredibly embarassing for all crypto enthusiasts, including me. I'm ashamed.
EDIT: Wow! I didn't know this post would get so popular... Thank you for all of the kind words and tips! After seeing all this positive feedback, maybe we're getting closer than i thought to getting back on the right track.

That quote really gets to me, it's extremely oppressive. I hope his philosophy and way of thinking has changed. :(

You should post this on They will appreciate it more.

It sounds more like YOU don't understand how Bitcoin works.

I will bet you are dad was happy.

You just compared an icebox to Bitcoin... r u srs?

*"...When prices fall, people put off buying things. ...*
This is a common fallacy in economics. I immediately stopped reading after that.

If I had five cents for every time I saw the word sense misspelled as "sence", and since it's a pretty common error, the scents of all those nickels combined would be incredible.
