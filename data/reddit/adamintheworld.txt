You just answered a question I had in mind for a while. What happens if the wallet you use disappears, say in the case that Apple or Google prohibits its download?

I’m buying in whenever it goes below wherever it is

Use CashApp, they don’t charge fees.

Max Keiser loves Abra, but what do y’all think of this app?
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:55:34
Yeah, kind of a hidden fee unless you read the fine print. Probably better to go with an exchange for large transactions, but for smaller transaction I think it winds up far cheaper. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:08:02
You’ve gotta use it to really get it. Was scary at first for me. Also been using Mycelium for 14 month and like it the best, super clean and simple
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:03:12
Agreed. That’s just confusing.

Yeah, Nixon’s “war on drugs” actually worked, and only 40 or so years later are we calling bullshit.
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:51:24
You have to look at the hashrate (currently at 40million terrahashes per second and rising) and how much computing power it would take, which is far greater than anything the planet has seen before. You would need an army of computers (this is the future of war). And then when you reached 51%, you would have to sustain that attack, otherwise the original group can go back those few blocks and reset the blockchain, which there would be a financial incentive for the average person to get involved in supporting the original BTC chain.

Can you tell me what tldr means, and how you tipped someone with bitcoin on this platform?!
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:44:54
I tried for a week with errors. I finally contacted them and they immediately fixed the issue. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:46:53
I’m increasingly confused why anyone would be interested in anything but bitcoin. There’s no transparency problem with bitcoin (unlike XRP), nobody controls it (unlike most ALL altcoins), it’s proven itself impenetrable to attack, and it continually evolves to do everything other coins can do, like Lightning anonymous micropayments (that covers Monroe, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, etc) and now even smart contracts like Etherium. The only reasonable complaint I hear is that it is slow to adapt, but in a world that isn’t overly eager to adapt ANY crypto, I don’t see that as a big problem. If somebody owns it, it’s not decentralized; and if it’s not decentralized, it’s not the future.

You can’t rid the world of evil; chaos and death is baked into existence. Focus on creating something good and it will solve a lot more.

Ahh thanks! I wanted to do a coin join but didn’t want to hand over my coin to someone running a website. If it’s done right with the wallet, sweet. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:50:44
I just checked the app and it still says, “We’ll let you know when Robinhood crypto is available in NY”

@_date: 2019-01-02 02:38:51
What do you think is a better alternative, and why?
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:07:27
Interesting article. It just seems like an irrationally costly way to do any of those things with transaction fees. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:02:34
I like CashApp the best, but they are sneaky in hiding their fees in plain sight. If you watch, when you buy bitcoin, they jack the price up above normal, and when you sell they turn around and give a below-normal price. Despite that, I still think they offer the best deal and they are the most popular financial app on the planet. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:24:24
When the only difference between you and your adult brother is a slight variation in tie color, it leaves me wondering how original you are. Regulation = more of the old bullshit that bitcoin is doing away with.

After a year of watching bitcoin closely, watching a million videos, I’m fully convinced nobody has a clue what’s gonna happen.
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:31:51
It’s a great indicator of where the interest is. Are there any closing in on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:26:50
I’ve found CashApp to be the easiest, and their fee is a small percentage. Way better than Coinbase, as least for small purchases. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:46:00
He’s had Antonopoulos on a several times and knows a lot more than he let on. Killer Mike wasn’t that interested.
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:37:22
Yes, but say I made 20 transactions from the KYC account to a single wallet using a different address each time, there would be no way to tell from the blockchain that all those transactions went to the same wallet, correct?
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:54:43
Second question, if I used a different receiving address each time I moved more into my wallet, in the event of a records hack nobody would know how much I actually hold versus spent, right?
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:29:55
It’s about community, bottom-up, not control.
Attacks, like viruses to our immune system, make it stronger. Good thing.
Didn’t know that about the taxes, though it’s likely to happen as the network matures in time. What other areas do you see where I’m inaccurate?

Yeah, he has mad vision for a different world
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:50:33
I don’t think you can legally (in the US at least). Learn everything you can (I wrote a thorough article on the financial system if you care to read it, check my profile, and watch everything by Andreas Antounopolis to understand the technical side which is important so you don’t lose the faith amidst all the misinformation out there). Then you’ll have to pay a friend to buy it for you and transfer it to your own wallet. Best of luck.

I came up with the idea for electric cars when I was 7, but Elon Musk took my idea. Probably gonna take that one to court next year, but right now I’m too busy I’m investing in your idea - it’s solid!

When everyone has access to an unlimited supply of money, the value of everything goes up in tandem. When I borrow 100K for an education and another 100K for a house, my education and house just cost you by devaluing your money and making everything more expensive through inflation. When the supply of money is limited and loans are not fractional but actual, these loans do not affect the currency’s supply and, hence, value. Prices stabilize, and the wealth goes to those who labor and contribute instead of to the money alchemists. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:32:24
All dollars are debt loaned through government bonds (and other confusing mechanisms, but not purchased with gold or silver) translated into Federal Reserve Notes, and loaned to the public. When all of that is repaid, all of the “money” disappears. Think of the Federal Reserve as the DJ, and they control the concert/market through loans and interest rates, highs and lows. And when the music stops, the show is over, everything goes back in the box. DJ BankRupt and Orchestra Humanity are playing tonight, and we all buy our ticket to one show or another.

The Creature From Jekyll Island is a good place to start. It’s lengthy, but thorough. 
People keep electing leaders, wanting to be led. Regardless of the name you give it - democracy, communism - it always leads to a minority feeding off the majority, owning them. There is either sovereignty/freedom by working together, or there’s servitude to leaders.

That will be one expensive coffee when the crypto market hits a bull run again!

I think it will be messy because we’ve built a global system on funny money, an ever-inflating bubble that, like Venezuela, eventually pops. It popped for them because they don’t have the priveledged position of being the world’s foremost currency and thus able to keep the game going by printing as much money as they want. America does, but that seems to be nearing an end. In which case, it’s either hyperinflation or recalling the money (raising interest rates) - both of which crash the system. “You can’t taper a ponzi scheme.” But, I think the damage could be lessened by transitioning to sound money, and the sooner the better.
Bitcoin can be traded to the tenth decimal, so it’s immaterial that there are only 21 million. People are hoarding it, which shows that it has value, which drives people away from fiat currencies, and eventually gold/silver/crypto will be the only real money, which will then cause the hoarders to have to spend it, putting it back in circulation. Only this time, the hoarders can’t create more of it out of thin air to buy politicians, they will have to do something of actual value with it, like investing in good ideas. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:39:44
For the same reason that a college education costs 100K. When the money can be loaned for nothing by the one with the printing press, everybody gets loans and then everything goes up in price. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:50:42
Why? Based on what?
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:20:45
But they utilize it, because vices get the best of humans when given power over others. Bitcoin is a decade-old theory being tried, with no human ruling over other humans, just an unthinking, unfeeling, unambitious algorithm, a tool. I’m sure this will be corrupted as all things are, maybe in an AI takeover in a hundred years and we’ll have a new struggle, but in the meantime I see it as a promising path for human freedom and cooperation, and supports communist ideals.

This is not the fiat you are looking for
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:23:58
People with money will always be looking to lend to those without, for a fee. This is good, as both parties benefit. Where it goes wrong is when a central authority can create these loans out of nothing (the current system) because if we all use that money, we all are robbed by the creation of more of it (inflation). Fractional reserve loans hurt everyone BUT the one making the fake money; real lending, such as loaning out gold and bitcoin, benefits everyone.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:07:59
Agreed on all points, but cash purchasing is basically impossible in the US, unless you have a connection, which I don’t. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:55:10
Supply and demand (when free of government meddling) will always allow markets to find the true prices of things. That’s how it’s worked for all of history. Why do prices based on fiat always rise? -because the government keeps printing more money. With a limited supply, they’d be stable. And the supply of 21 million is not a problem because one bitcoin is divisible and tradable to 8 decimal places, fractions of fractions of a penny.

I feel you. I have a passion for living free and in harmony with nature and fellow humans. If all of us take any tiny steps we can towards that (financial independence like bitcoin, consuming less and buying local, doing work that builds a better future, working together, moving away from the city to get closer to nature, walking away from the games of politics to get involved in the world we can actually touch, speaking the truth in patience) we’ll get there eventually. I’m with you!
