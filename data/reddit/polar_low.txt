You've just to to pray for the child's sake they never sell. They'd have to chop off its right arm to cover mining fees.

Wow. The things you learn on this sub!

Kudos to all nodes who verify posts and keep this sub honest.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:14:57
Is there somewhere I can read on how routing through LN works? i.e. which algorithm does it use to find the shortest path? Do nodes maintain routing tables or is it more ad hoc than that?
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:56:48
A fascinating watch.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:27:51
You'll be able to take advantage of lower fees with a Segwit address.
Non Segwit to non Segwit = higher fee
Non Segwit to Segwit = higher fee
Segwit to non Segwit = lower fee
Segwit to Segwit = lower fee

Andreas explains the answer to your point excellently. "When you change the medium, the message changes. When you change the granularity of time, very strange things start to happen".

Oh! I've had no idea what that cake symbol has meant all day. Thanks. Have a slice.

Yes. Unlike their their segwit implementation which could be 12 months away. I'm done with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:56:31
Do we have any idea on actual transactions per second on the testnet? What if any stress testing has taken place?
Awesome link btw.

Thanks. Kicking my Ledger Nano now. Looking forward to more gains.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:19:57
Can you elaborate please? If I want to send my Bread funds to a bech32 Electrum address, I have do do something extra than I would with a regular transaction? Can bech32 addresses send to non segwit addresses and vice versa?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:26:05
Coincidentally, I've just emailed Bread to ask this very question. I'm giving Bitcoin to many newbie friends and family this Christmas with a little guide on how to set up a wallet. I want the wallet I recommend to be bread because it is so usable for newbies but without a rough date on segwit activation I'm seriously looking at other, probably desktop options.
*edit* Anyone who wants to do the same can email support
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:41:19
Awesome. Say hypothetically somebody wanted to buy a whole load of these to do similar, is there an option for using cheaper paper or bulk discounts? (Appreciate you not wanting to cut into your share of the price).
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:46:48
The network provides a special discount to segwit transactions. 
"Normally, each byte in a transaction counts as 4 bytes of block weight. However, if a byte is part of the SegWit witness area, then it receives a discount, and only counts as 1 byte of block weight."
I'm not sure whether you can directly translate this into a 75% reduction in fees but this site might be able to shed some light.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:31:40
I wonder if Bitcoin could be theoretically Hard Forked to be purely paper based? Reduce the difficulty massively and get Comp Sci students to verify blocks as their homework. The reward is their assignment being written to the blockchain and their homework is eternalised on Bitcoin Paper™.

@_date: 2019-11-02 22:20:14
So messages are transmitted in HTLCs as transactions are? Would all nodes on a route between sender and receiver need to be running this fork of LND or is it compatible with existing nodes?
Really cool.

Thanks for the cheap BTC guys. Sold my yearly bonus shares at work and loaded up on BTC. Been wanting to do this for a while but only in the last few days has it looked good value again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:26:01
Bitcoin has gained 68% of its value in the last 12 months. It doesn't look like you have a point...
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:16:49
Wait, does everyone who is being tipped have an LN node linked to their Reddit handle or something? Or is Reddit the custodian? Can someone please explain this ridiculous internet wizardry to me?
@_date: 2019-08-18 05:52:16
Oh dear. How embarrassing for you.
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:10:28
You're on a Bitcoin forum talking up FIAT. Cringe.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:31:31
You clearly didn't read mine. In * twelve * months. Bitcoin has gained. 68% of its current value. What exactly is your point?

An 8% jump in half an hour is not the sign of an asset which is "dead". So to turn the question around, "how stupid are you?" oh wise one?

Do you want to tone down the xenophobic jingoism a bit? Brits are not some sort of super race. Claiming we work harder than the Polish plumbers and Romanian builders who come to this country is ridiculous. You're either drunk or trolling. Go to bed.
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:31:23
The whale won't be able to sell the whole lot at 10k some may sell for 9.3k. However there may be some panic in the market after he's done selling so the price could fall back further in the short term. He could then in theory buy back in cheaper at 8.5k for example during peak panic. Dump n pump.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:23:14
I wouldn't be surprised it it dropped further either but then unless you're a day trader, who's really bothered? You're either in this to make a quick buck or you believe it has a future.

37% (in a non binding referendum) is not a majority. Technically it may have won a referendum but it doesn't necessarily represent the viewpoint of the majority of the population as you were trying to suggest when defending wittystick.
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:53:53
You don't talk for all Brits. David sounds like he has a better grasp than you do to be fair.
Middle England Conservatism is not Britain.
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:25:13
The numbers? Only 37% of the electorate voted for Brexit. Even fewer when you count the population. Must try harder.
@_date: 2019-08-04 11:13:03
Download another wallet (Samourai for example) and instead of generating a new seed, there will be an option to input an existing seed. You can do this with multiple wallets. Remember a wallet doesn't contain your funds, it holds your private keys which gives you the ability to interact with your funds on the blockchain via the wallet app. Your private key can live in multiple wallets at once and your funds are spendable by any of those wallets. Just be extremely careful that you trust wherever you're inputting your seed and go back to keeping your keys in one wallet once you've fixed your issue.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:05:18
No one's making a big deal about it because they don't have &gt;50%. It's currently 42%.

Once upon a time Bitcoin was tiny and consumed the same amount of electricity as a microwave oven. It can do so again. Mining difficulty will reduce drastically to accommodate this.
That's not all. It's been proven we don't even need electricity for the internet to work.

I believe the theory is that to try to win the BCH war, each side wants to push up their own fork's hashrates to increase security and improve confidence. People like Jihan still have big stakes in BTC so are selling to fund extra mining costs.
If that's what's happening that's their prerogative. A big risk on their part dumping that much BTC to burn for mining an altcoin but interesting nonetheless for those of us watching from the sidelines, and a chance to buy cheap(er) BTC.

We have London based Coinfloor who are very good in my experience though for some reason you have to wire deposits internationally to Poland.
The British government are going to be gridlocked for the next 4 years trying to work out what their relationship is with the rest of Europe. I wouldn't expect much reform of anything in that time, not least the multi billion pound cash cow which is London's financial sector. All efforts will be focused on keeping the banks from relocating to mainland Europe/Dublin.

Will be interesting to see what happens. Weren't CME futures to blame for a 4-5 months of BTC price depreciation when it was first introduced because of the huge short positions? Since we already have futures perhaps this wont be an issue this time? Who knows? Fascinating shit.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:10:06
Is that the best you've got? You've been shown up multiple times in this thread to be talking complete bollocks and all you have left is to resort to conspiracy theories. Desperate stuff. 
People all over the country are changing their minds on Brexit. Look at the polls, listen to people on the street. The British people aren't stupid and know when they've been sold a pack of lies.
@_date: 2019-09-18 10:04:32
No denial here. You havent got a clue about "Real Brits". My family members who voted leave have since changed their mind and would rather stay or leave with a much closer union. All happy with the idea of a second referendum. Real Brits who now wish to remain. The nationwide polls show a similar story. That picture certainly isn't London. Bradford maybe. Again, please stop lying.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:42:14
Wrong again! You're not very good at this are you? Lol.
National polls show Brits want to remain in the EU. A minority want to leave without a deal. That's a fact you'd know if you lived in this country. Sorry to burst your bubble again.
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:27:38
Interesting article, though the trusted nature of these Oracles is clearly an issue without a straightforward solution. Would be interesting to know if these researchers are aware of &amp; what they think of ChainLink's whitepaper. There's a solution there they could build into this project, or probably Chainlink will provide an implementation for Lightning. We'll see, but either way the potential for this capability is huge.

Pretty much every programmer will tell you how important a reliable internet connection is. I've been doing it for over 15 years and would still struggle to do my job without visiting StackOverflow 20 times a day. Changes need to be integrated every few hours. Doing it once a week in huge blobs is a recipe for disaster. And then there are major production incidents. "Yeah, give me a week before I can investigate that serious defect".
It's not that simple.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:53:15
This is why I love this sub. Learning so much about the current system puts into context many of BTC's core design decisions.

As a great man once said, "not your keys, not your bitcoin". Ultimately, when your coins are on the exchange, they have the private key to your coins, you don't. So they can in theory (and quite often do) block people from withdrawing their funds, go bust, get hacked. Any significant amount you really don't want to keep on an exchange for any longer than is necessary.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:30:57
Might do this the next time an overly pushy salesman latches on. Go along with whatever they're selling, accept all the add ons and when it they say "Sorry, we don't accept BTC" act disappointed and say "Sorry, that's a deal breaker. I don't want to pay in fiat". It's one way to drive adoption...
