Wrong. Backed by petroleum trade. Maybe not for too much longer, but still is. Look up petro dollar

Used to be, it’s backed by the trade of petroleum nowadays. Probably won’t be in a decade though. It’s phasing out

You messed up by selling.

Could be, always a chance, but probability wise probably not. Could be a 100 years too. The truth is no one knows. Most of these 'experts' are talking out there ass and have high positions they want to make money on.

inevitable sure, but how long is the question no one knows. Could be 10 years, could be 50.

I agree, it is coming. However it's foolish to think that it happening in 10 days has as equal of a chance to it happening in 10 years. There's a bell curve of probability. Statistically speaking it has a very very low probability of happening in 10 days, but a near guaranteed probability of happening by the end of the 21st century. I am not sure where the peak of the bell curve is, however my assumption would be in the range of the next 10 to 30 years from now. To think that the chances of it happening in 10 days is equal to the chances of it happening in 5 years is just ignorance.

I agree, however if the entire fiat system were to global collapse in 10 days, we'd have a bigger issue on our hands. Look at the overall state of Venezuela. Having value in something that's not fiat is wonderful, however if you don't have a civilized and orderly society around you than 'money' as a concept really doesn't do much.

The extremism within the CC community does more harm than good.

Whataboutism is irrelevant. One group being more “rational” than another does not excuse the irrational and delusional thought of another group.
