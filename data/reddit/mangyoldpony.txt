It could have done with proper coverage of how bitcoin could change the developing world and micro payments etc, genuine changes to the financial model. Instead we were just led round one US startup after another all of who are doing much the same thing.

thanks great response. Probably the only part of Bitcoin that I didn't understand.

Why is Bitcoin so good again? I pay for the movie with bit coin but have to wait for up to an hour for it to be confirmed?

Presumably if coins started leaving his address whoever was receiving those coins would have a reasonable chance of figuring out who he is. Whether it was an exchange, a shop, an online shop - surely if anyone figured out they were receiving coins from Satoshi's address then there would be clues to who he is?

Boring it's just talking heads. So dry.

I need two email addresses to put coins in the vault. I don't want to set up another email account to do this. Isn't there a better way?

I've done Netagio but they now use a European bank which charged me about £25 to transfer the money. There's also not much liquidity on the exchange unless its gotten more popular in the last couple of months. They also have this rule where you aren't allowed to remove the Bitcoin in full from your Netagio wallet for about 20 days for security reasons. However they make a big deal about their storage being secure. 
Speedybitcoin have never given me an account despite multiple emails requesting an invite. 
Coinfloor rejected my bank statement proof of address  because it was an internet print out despite Barclays telling me that's what they'd send me in the mail anyway if I requested it. I don't pay any other bills so couldn't get round that one. 
Haven't tried any others

strange as I don't remember seeing a GBP wallet in my account before and I did a test and sold some BTC in GBP then transferred to my GBP wallet which gave me the option to withdraw to my UK bank account. 
Coinbase website says UK customers can only withdraw in Euros

Can I point out this is a commodities rout rather than just specifically Gold.

I'm seriously tired of hearing about these two. They are speculators who have offered nothing to BTC in terms of innovation. There isn't enough demand at the moment to warrant another exchange and an ETF is a speculative asset which contradicts the principles of Bitcoin, just as Gold ETFs do.

Another problem with these calculations. i don't see a way for merchants to make these savings without passing some or most of the savings on to the consumer, particularly given the pricing of products generally incorporates this cost. Hence the incentive to use Bitcoin in the first place in drastically reduced.

Personally I don't think he's a good advocate for cryptocurrency. He had a good platform but just went looking for a fight. Most people who don't know about bitcoin won't be enticed by that performance. Plus his voice grates my ears.
