FFS I hit my interac limit until Friday.  I want in on this dip :/

Yes. But things are accelerated in the crypto world.

Xrp works with traditional financial institutions. This is a safe way to start to move into crypto from a bank's point of view.  It goes against what Bitcoin is  truly about but might turn out to be lucrative and a intermediate step from establishments into crypto.  Maybe it will take years for it to go crazy, but it most definitely is resilient..for this moment.

Price is up because QuadricaCX had to wait until 9pm to accept interac transfers again.  Canadians are buying.

True. Thing is if you think about this there is no way Roger and co  dumped all their respective BTC for the coinbase launch. There will be a final showdown at some point. Right now it's a chopping of BTC until it's a position of a "death blow". Then there will be a last effort to take position. Keep an eye out for when his next media apperances are.
