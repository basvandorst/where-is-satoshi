When the bitcoin reward per block drops to 12.5 the price of bitcoin will have to be significantly higher to warrant miners continuing mining.

Sometimes I wonder if the Bitcoin community has the maturity to work with people like Ben Lawsky who is genuinely trying to help  regulate Bitcoin  to prevent catastrophes like MtGox. He is not out to crush Bitcoin.

The fundamental law of bitcoin pricing is good news drives price down, controversial news drives the price up, Bad news (mtgox, china banning) makes bitcoin nosedive.

First off the torrent protocol uses the old RC4 encryption algorithm which  the NSA can literally decrypt it in real time. So the government knows what files your downloading using torrents and if they wanted to drop those packets they could enforce this at the ISP level. But fortunately the RIAA can't force the NSA to enforce the laws against piracy

So when does the running of fullnodes become incentivized?

If there is not a incentive there is a problem. Nothing in the bitcoin protocol can rely on peoples altruism, period.

Bitcoin mining is adding around 10-15% to the total amount of bitcoins in existence. Right now mining is providing inflation. Also  no point of sale solution for retail stores to accept Bitcoin have been created which is key for adoption imo

Governments could stop the relaying of all bitcoin p2p packets at ISP. End of bitcoin in its current form.

Oh I agree, protocol work needs to slow down but crucial issues such as the scalability problem, sybil attack prevention, anonymity, end-to-end encryption, incentives to propagate transactions, etc need to be addressed.

too much focus on mining without as much focus directed towards developing bitcoin's infrastructure (ie implementing multisig)

Every transaction that occurs can be traced back to the originating ip address. The wire protocol is sent over http and thus vulnerable to MITM attacks. Pools are inherently antithetical to decentralization and non-standard transactions are still only relayed by Eligius..there is plenty of work to be done. 
Also, there is no incentive to run a full node which is essential to the network functionality

They don't have enough liquidity to handle large swings. I think they need to start another round of venture capital funding.

Anyone Bitcoin fullnode right now is more than capable of handling a increase of the block size limit

The problem is that with so much VC + miner money vested in Bitcoin in it's current form the developers are in a way shying away from adding new features and big changes. For instance, there are several solutions to the 51% attack but because these fixes could alter the current mining pools/miners its almost guaranteed we won't see any of those solutions merged into the codebase.

It is still too hard for average consumers to buy a Bitcoin and even if they waited through bank verification/etc there has not been a push for mainstream retail adoption. Simple as that.
