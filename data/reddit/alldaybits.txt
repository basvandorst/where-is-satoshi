Reality is created through thought.   Thought makes for very good business.
I believe Satoshi believed in the same principles.  With optimism he was able to create a thriving business environment for Bitcoin.  Its people like him that will continue to convert leaders and governments that change is coming.
No stopping Bitcoin November!

The new regulations is a great start.  They will change over time but for now they open the door.

You need to have more faith.  Its November, its Bitcoin Season!  
So many doomsayers in 2008 but US didn't collapse.  Have faith in the people voted into power.  They want the US to win.  As you can from the links above they're all joining the party and getting excited.

Could have been a lot worse.  
Small steps forward will equal GIGANTIC price movements upwards.  
November is our month!
