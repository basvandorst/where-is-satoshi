We aren't out of the woods yet! BTC has to gain support above $6500 to leave the worst behind us (which it is currently failing to do and holding under).

Your coindance link returns a downed page. Do you also mean 7:06?

Nice UX design.

Sounds sketchy that it's a USB. I guess it's possible though. I would do this yourself if you are tech savvy enough or get a trusted friend to help. I wouldn't trust random people to help you like other comments have mentioned.
First, create a copy of the entire drive to work with if you can (don't risk making changes or tampering with the original source files until you are sure what you are dealing with).
Do your research and see how bitcoins might be stored on the drive based on the file info and their extensions.
There are wallets that store BTC on USB drives. Here are some common examples: 
See if you can connect anything on the drive to one of these wallets (dig into the file names/extensions/references/encryption). Narrow down the possibilities. Rise and repeat.

If it trends up it could climb nicely.

Correction? Yeah, how about a correction back to normal from the $2k+ it gained since 10/28/2017 from traders trying to get paid off segwitx2 splits. The actual price of BTC is around $5kish at the moment. Rip greedy boosters ruining the market for the rest of the hodlers.

Very true sir.

Good for him. He might have looked just as good shaving his head and maintaining this beard though.

I like regurts and yogurts. The strawberry kind is yum.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:19:14
Oh yes $7k. Wait, when did this happen? Right before it dropped to $6100?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:35:02
What a player. I get that people cant expect to realize earnings from their lost BTC holdings (even if they were to recover a portion of them or their associated value as part of a claim). However, the fact that be made money (.8 billion) off of losing billions of dollars is astounding! What a world. SMH

Grats! Just wait another 5 years! :D

So putting a purchase order locks in the price right? How about the coin amount/quantity/result if it forked or not?

Maybe, he should have done it in smaller 10k transactions though...
