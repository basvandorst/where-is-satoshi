What 'bull market run'?  I think you are equating reddit headlines into market value or market sentiment.  The bottom line is we are in a post-bubble lull.  Bitcoin price moves horizontally for most of the year and then vertically for a short time.  We rise and dip here and there but hold until the next bubble.

Coinbase sets its price based on an algorithm it uses to derive market value.  Its based on the price of Bitstamp as that is where they eventually purchase BTC from.  The price of BTC can be quite volatile, so I don't believe Coinbase is trying to scam you.  See and for more info.

Even if they sank 'a few billion', a lot would still have to fall into place.  First, they need to procure a vast amount of ASICs which is as of right now, is not possible (they would need to actually start manufacturing ASICs).  For this undertaking, IMHO their effort wouldn't go unnoticed, as they would essentially have to pull off a 51% attack in a shroud of secrecy.  Too many people would be needed.  The question is, once the Bitcoin community realizes that a nation-state is attempting to execute a 51% attack, what can be done to stop it?

I could, but that just introduces another point of failure/security risk.  Especially if a lot of coin is involved.  If both Coinbase (which isn't even an exchange) and MtGox have this feature, I really think that Bitstamp would too.  Too bad I can't cashout USD with MtGox.  I wonder if BTC-e has it.

Couldn't disagree more.  When websites use ads as their primary source of revenue, you (the reader) become the product that the website is selling to their advertisers.  This results in more quantity and less quality.
With paywalls (and to a degree tips), this is no longer the case.  The overall content is held to a higher standard.

Coinbase is NOT an exchange.  It is an online wallet that doubles as a broker.  Bitstamp and MtGox are exchanges, ie they hold a large amount of bitcoins and a large amount of fiat and execute buys/sells that only take seconds.

I'm saying they would make more money in the long run.  Offer a slight discount, where both Overstock makes a profit and the customers get a discount.  This in turn leads to more BTC purchases.  This in turn leads to more profit for Overstock.

Yea I don't like that idea.

Coinbase is not an exchange people!
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:51:43
I literally feel sorry for you.

Best article I've read in a really long time.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:28:00
Whoa, this could be huge.

Works fine for me in chrome.
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:29:05
I see what you did there.

No thanks.

Nothing to do with bitcoin, posted this to the wrong sub.

Fairly racist.

A man is just flesh and blood and can be ignored or destroyed. But as a symbol... As a symbol, I can be incorruptible, everlasting."

+1 for 'butt-hurt'
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:21:06
I'm sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:56:44
Yes, called private key collisions, ie 2 different private keys result in the same pubic bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:58:36
Cool thanks for the info!

I highly recommend you read the following five part blog.  Here is part 1:

I see what you did there.  Bravo Garcon.

From their support:  
"Hi there,  
Sorry for the confusion! We have temporarily disabled the  paper wallet functionality in order to improve this feature. The  improvements should be done within two weeks, at which point paper wallets will be re-enabled. Until then, you are able to create new paper wallets at the following third-party service:
I hope this information helps, please let me know if you need any further assistance!"
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:43:12
Also, it looks like they will be just posting transactions to bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:46:31
My question: Are you Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:11:43
Yes, thats exactly what I was trying to say.

I honestly believe somebody at Bloomberg got paid off with some BTC recently.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:06:01
I'm here for BTC.

Hover over your account in the top right -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Bitcoin Addresses -&gt; Create a new address.  Send btc from you BTCChina account to the new address.

I'm surprised no one has stolen the BTC on the private key mentioned in the article yet.
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:18:34
Does anyone know when .9 is coming out?
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:48:08
Coinbase only allows 50k of withdraw once a day.  And even though I am pretty sure that they have to wait until each ACH clears before they process the next transaction but you should ask this over at @_date: 2013-12-24 06:29:00
You funny
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:50:30
It mentions it can hide your account balance but I can don't see any option for that.  Has anyone figured out how to hide their balance?
EDIT: You can hide by swiping it to the right.

Deleted the coinbase cookie in chrome and I can log in now.

Check out the bitcoin days destroyed today... 
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:13:58
Lot of activity going on, a 56k and 90k transaction...
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:58:23
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:06:47
It measures "old coins" (coins that have been in the same wallet for a long time).  When the number of bitcoin days destroyed is high like it is today, its basically tells us that there were a lot of old coins transacted today.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:34:12
You can use   I wouldn't put a lot of coin on these things though seeing as the private key was generated by lazzerbee and not you.  You can always use bitaddress.org too.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:12:00
Was that guy rolling a joint at the end of the video?
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:16:55
Consensus for ledger verification is necessary.  Consensus for expiring coins is scary.  I get that it is possible but the thinking should be that it will not.  In the same fashion, consensus could be reached that the total number of bitcoins be increased.  This would defeat the deflationary property of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:44:27
Can't see this happening - at this point 'the entire Bitcoin network' is essentially a 'trusted' 3rd party making up arbitrary rules.  Kind of defeats the whole point of Bitcoin.
