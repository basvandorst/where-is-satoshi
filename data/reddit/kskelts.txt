again this is the fact of this week, ill do this for the month, quarter, year, 5 year, and start to date if you want, but you know, this week mattered a ton for the financial quarter. you're superstitious and praying to a imaginary god if you don't think this is fact based meaning. Good lick with your blood sacrifice to cause a unexpected shift. I actually hope for it too, but I'm sharing the facts of the past week.

mark zucky will be, how to say, committing gross tax evasion and illegally using securities to fund non-secured market capital, which is a breach in his shareholders securities, and pretty sure multiple other illegal things would be involved. point is, he'll have to use his own money to start this, or separate funding, and he cant attach it to facebook, which defeats the purpose of his message entirely. r/fbi, i'd like to report a conspiracy on the level of espionage and at least felony theft

@_date: 2019-10-01 14:37:10
It's a simple fix of buying as the price drops at a 25%-75% ratio of your current share, and then selling that rebuy up at 25-75% of your current percentage loss.
I say this, because it would be good for the USD and the World economy's value, if BTC did deflate for the rest of the year, or else in the next year we can expect inflation in all world currencies, including crypto.

individual investors of our generation are most likely pondering weekly on whether to support the stock market or the crypto market. If one has a minimum wage paycheck to splurge each week, then one must assume what is more feasible with their capital, the bitcoin dance over a week, or an assured stock market rise over the course of a year. Both are valuable, but some people are gaining more time to make a wiser decision.
@_date: 2019-09-24 10:49:30
The point is this, crypto currency is anonymous. Nobody will watch this climb 1% if they have 10k in it, they’ll pull out and watch it fall. Every time

[post 3/3] it wasn’t a trick or a scheme it was simply that the cost to buy in fell that quickly and the rate of its volume gains was very promising to new investors, and for old investors the profits would completely fix their losses.
These past few days BTC has experienced a scare, however the volume rate of change has been stable in terms of the world economy’s inflation. This is quite promising for bitcoin investors and fulfilling the need of gathering more capital investments. 
One should hope that it’s understood in the next 5 days, the volumes rate of change should either be flattened to a 0% change or have a nice rise.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:42:20
Most Bitcoin traders are day/week trading to keep trade volumes moving. It's odd that there's been such a pullback considering there hasn't been a tier that low since the end of August. Thus, the aggressive selling is either people in fear, people trying to generate new volume rise, or something odd having to do with disclosed news I've not yet stumbled upon.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:33:38
r/cryptocurrency expect another dip as people wake up to this. would recommend small investors and daytraders pull out and let large investors and hedges take the risk.
@_date: 2019-09-24 10:51:46
Point one is that when crypto first began, there was a value that couldn’t be pushed or pulled so it was a long term investment, now bitcoin has a value that can easily be pushed or pulled, and it’s not a long term investment worth your time unless you treat it like a job that you monitor every moment, or else you will witness a crash happen that you cannot explain to an investor.

I've been in the market since 2013 if im correct. anyways, by fractions I mean this, you look at your crpyto, you buy it at a lowball, you wait until you find a fraction that makes sense.
Example: if you see crypto A drop 15% after you buy it, you must buy again  a higher sum than you purchased before. if you do this, you will gain within an hours time, so long as you repeat this.
If you're a broke ass bitch, then you must sit and wait until the price you purchased at rises to something better, and this could take forever. Ultimately the broke ass bitch is very much food for the smart man who decided to use fractions.
*i've blocked you, so you must make new account to speak with me.
I will tell you more about fractions, but you must be my friend, not an internet troll who is too shallow to admit he isn't atleast a hundred-thousand-aire.

[post 2/3] BTC unlike other crypto recovered fairly quick, yet it still needed time from the collapse. Yet the rate it recovered was much faster than the rate it was gaining before the crash.
