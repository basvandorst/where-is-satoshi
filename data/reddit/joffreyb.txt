yep. used to eat out for lunch everyday. now i just make a sandwich and save 40$ a week (it's a good sandwich too - nice meat and cheese and it tastes so good because i know bc i'm eating it i'm able to buy more bitcoin). 
40$ saved per week just on lunches \~ 160$ a month. 
also eating cheaper dinners and don't got out as much for drinks. it is so satisfying eating for cheap.

I've got it set up now. If you go to the invoice, select lightning from the drop down menu and it'll work.

thanks bud!  I appreciate the nice words and the order. I'll get yours shipped out tomorrow. I'm working on tshirt ideas too. quality is very important to me though so it takes time to get everything right - plus not everyone is willing to work for bitcoin- yet.

$21 +  8 dollar flat rate shipping though - i know.... it's pricey but they actually were expensive to produce (full disclosure - they cost me about 14.50 per mug so not a ridiculous markup)

i think it will have lower inflation rate than gold after next halving.

btw, i've got it so we accept lightning now so you can update spending-bitcoin now :)

I think I should have lightning implemented by tonight. RECKLESSSS

Thanks so much!

I've never done it before. I'll do it for you at the flat 8$ rate just to see how much it costs and eat it if it's terrible.

Thank you! I'll let Santa know.

I don't right now but I'm working on getting that set up. I just built the site yesterday. Definitely will accept lightning in the future.

it was a way for me to support people who were willing to work for bitcoin. you might not need a coffee mug, because we all already have them, but i'm trying to actually use bitcoin rather than just holding it. here we have a product that was produced with bitcoin. i think it's pretty cool. but yeah, nobody really needs it.
