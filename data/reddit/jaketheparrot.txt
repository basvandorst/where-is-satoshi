I've made over 100 transactions so I've run through all of my change addresses for qt. Will it create another set of 100 and store it or just create a new change address after every new transaction. It would be nice if it just created a new set so I could back up the next 100 change addresses in one back up instead of needing to back up after every transaction.

The whole pretext behind the police confiscating or "stealing" the money is that the money was gained illegally. Confiscating money from a drug dealer, human trafficker, or other criminal makes sense. The problem is that they're simply confiscating money that they have no reason to believe is illegally obtained aside from some made up circumstantial evidence. 
The reason they do that is because it directly benefits them. Stop the direct benefit and the issue disappears.

The point is yes bitcoin can help in this situation, but that doesn't solve the problem of civil liberties being violated. Id rather not have to worry about securing my wealth in a complicated manner because it's an us(the people) vs them(the government) dynamic. We need to fix the incentives to solve this probelm. 
Isn't there an association that represents people's civil liberties that can lobby congress to do something about this?

This isn't a bitcoin issue it's a civil liberties issue. People are being treated like criminals for carrying cash and having their cash and property seized. We need to change the incentives. The police departments should not be able to keep confiscated money. Have it go to veterans or children's hospitals or inmates. Just not police departments so the police can get a bigger budget or make their chief happy so he doesn't have to worry about the upcoming budget cuts next year. 
This is ridiculous. Cops have an incentive to break the law.

A lot are worthless, but there are plenty that make sense. Alternatives with a more robust programming language enable smart contracts. Alternative focused on incentivizing proper reporting of real world events for use on the block chain(oracles) enable smart contracts to do more than just enable ICOs. A social media network that rewards participants for contributing and curating with something of actual value makes sense. Especially if that can be broadened beyond just a link or comment aggregating site like reddit or steemit. 
Coins focused on a fixed business’ ecosystem are generally either poorly designed, too niche for mainstream adoption, or a cash grab. If your designing a vr helmet for porn that will be purchased with your coin that doesn’t seem like that will be around in 5-10 years.

You pay taxes to be part of a reasonable society with all of its conveniences. If you don't want to pay taxes leave the country, don't use any of its products, and live in the wilderness somewhere. Modern technological advances wouldn't be possible without the conveniences of society. That includes bitcoin. 
Whining about paying taxes is childish. Step up, be a man, and contribute to society in some way.

Trump is not playing 4D chess. He is a narcissist that was a great marketer and his campaign lined up perfectly with an extremely weak GOP field for the presidency.  His promises appealed to a swathe of Americans that feel like their voices haven’t been heard in Washington politics: low skill/uneducated workers, racists/xenophobes, fundamental Christians. 
Trump appealed to the fear a lot of modern Americans have in a rapidly transforming world that they’re going to be left behind. Other politicians around the world aren’t emulating Trump. They’re appealing to that same fear and it’s resulting in regressive protectionist parties taking over across the world. 
Trump and conservative media have spun a narrative that he is winning, but he is bumbling from one disaster to the next. The economy didn’t need saving.  It’s on the exact same course it was before he became president. He enacted an enormous corporate tax cut and changed tax law that effectively increased taxes on a lot of Americans. The tax cut has offered a quick boost to the stock market because lower taxes mean higher profits which increase equity values. The issue is the loss in tax revenue from corporations means our deficit and national debt is exploding and that isnt going to change since his corporate tax cuts are permanent.  The US is taking on more and more debt to prop up equity values and that can’t go on forever. The music will stop. 
His isolationist agenda has eroded the United States soft power throughout Europe and Asia. The US intervened in Syria to protect US and US allies interests. Leaving Syria up for grabs leaves the area open for Russian influence. North Korea is still developing and perfecting nuclear missles so I’m not sure what he’s winning over there. 
The only thing Trump has been successful at is eroding the checks and balances in our democracy. His executive refuses to be accountable to anyone and thinks they should be able to do anything they want. They stonewall congress, which has oversight authority, and drag every decision through the courts while they blatantly ignore the law. Trump is not executing the responsibilities of his office in good faith. He is in the middle of a campaign to broaden executive power to a dangerous level. His argument is literally the president can do anything he wants and can’t be held accountable by anyone. That’s a king not a democratically elected leader. 
Why do you think he is so concerned about that? Because he’s broken so many laws that he knows he is fucked if that isn’t the case. He should literally be in prison right now. He isn’t smart. He isn’t playing 4D chess. He is fighting for his freedom the only way he can. By expanding executive power to be limitless and unaccountable to other branches of government. This is desperation time for Trump.

That’s not what I explained or it wasn’t my intent. I was simplifying the explanation. Large purchases don’t really leave the banking system. They just move credits around on ledgers. But effectively if you get a loan from bank A and send funds to individual 2 who uses bank B and bank B loans to individual 2 who sends funds to individual 3 who uses bank A, bank A has received the same funds again. That’s how the money supply works. It’s just that it doesn’t really matter that the same bank gets the same money. Loans that are issued increase the money supply.

The banking system is built on lending different people, corporations, etc the same money over and over. Banks are required by law to keep a fraction of their deposits liquid or accessible and available for withdrawal. That’s called their reserves. The rest of their funds are loaned out. To see how $1M can quickly become much more than $1M in debt let’s go through a simple example. 
You cash in all of your bitcoin for a windfall of $1M. You’re not going to keep that in cash under your mattress so you deposit in a bank. The bank sets aside 3% for reserves and now has $970k to loan out. Company ABC would like to build a new factory to expand their operations and needs exactly $970k to do that so they apply for a loan at your bank and the bank approves. So ABC Corp now has $970k to spend and the bank holds a note for the debt increasing its total debt receivables by $970k. ABC turns around and pays the $970k to their contractor to build their factory. The contractor receives the funds and deposits them in his bank. 
That bank reserves 3% and has about $941k available to lend out. You decide that you want a nice house and find one that costs $941k. You don’t want to spend all of your new bitcoin wealth on a house though so you decide to apply for a mortgage. The contractors bank approves you and you receive $941k and the bank increases their debt receivables by $941k. You spend the $941k on the house and the seller deposits it in his bank and the cycle repeats until all of the original $1M is held by banks as reserves. 
In just two loans on the same $1M deposit the system created $1.92M in debt receivables for the banking system. Follow this to the end and it creates a lot more debt owed within the system to the lenders than the depositors have. The reserve rates dictate how much.

This will likely get downvoted, but if current IPO regulation wasn't in place you would almost certainly have much larger interest from the general public/world in buying companies at insanely overvalued prices, which is a poor result for the general public. 
Think about the amount of interest people are showing in ICOs right now. For the most part we're still talking about early adopters and some financial institution type players. 
Now imagine if tomorrow a company such as uber could just run ads on facebook, YouTube, your favorite website that said "Hey you use uber everyday. Why not own a piece of the company you use! We're going to be offering shares in uber for a price of $29.99. That's basically one ride to the airport. Don't miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime."  I don't doubt that a large portion of the population would buy shares without thinking about the company's balance sheet, share structure, shares outstanding, earnings, and a number of other pertinent factors. 
Now I lean towards libertarian views of freedom is good, but the shit show that would result from the general public being involved in price discovery for an iPo would be bad. 
That's essentially playing out now with ICOs and I can guarantee you a lot of people are going to lose money compared to the portion that will have a good return. Freedom is good but it has its price. Regulations come about when the price becomes to painful to pay. 
Until we forget and the cycle starts over again.

Except the US dollar isn't the standard pricing unit of just oil. Every international trade deal is priced in the US dollar. International traders don't need to keep track of the conversion between pesos and Rands, or Dong to Yen, it's each individual currency to the dollar. 
It will take a complete loss of faith in the us government and people to disrupt this. It isn't all about a single trade deal between Russia and China.

Is backing up your wallet as simple as going into windows explorer, finding the wallet.dat file and copying it over to a USB drive?  I did that as a precaution in case my computer crashes(it's a 4 year old laptop), but I'm not really sure how I would go about restoring it on another computer. Would I just install the wallet on the new computer and then replace the wallet.dat file with the one from my USB drive? What are the actual steps for backing up your file. Thanks

How long does it usually take for an account to be verified at coin base?
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:29:28
I think the only way this would work is if a large company like a bank or insurance company with a large amount of collateral is willing to use that as backing for the insurance/deposit service and then maybe cap the amount they are willing to hold/insure. 
To be clear they wouldnt be insuring bitcoins that you are holding on your own hard drive like some people in this thread seem to think. The company would be guaranteeing the safety of any bitcoins deposited with the company from loss. (This would operate like a bank and that doesn't have to be a bad thing)
I don't see why this wouldn't work and it will probably be necessary for a lot of less tech savvy adopters once bitcoin becomes more wide spread. You would have the majority of your bitcoin wealth secure in a bitcoin bank and have some in a wallet for everyday spending.

Is there anyway to tell where the mining hardware is located. One thing that has always worried me about ASICMiner is that Friedcat seems to have little risk in taking asicminer hardware and mining on his own on the side. What proof did he provide that the gen 2 Asics weren't cost effective? It's been &gt;6 months since they released gen 1 and nothing succesful has happened. Could a large private mining setup like this be Friedcat mining with gen2 hardware on his own?

Back in March this is the sort of thing I actually predicted would initiate a wider acceptance of bitcoin among the regular population. In fact I even used Overstock.com as an example of a large business that could be motivated into accepting bitcoin. 
Instead of this news, the wild run up in price and accompanying speculators are what has defined bitcoin in the past few months. Hopefully more news like this will come out that can stabilize bitcoin and prove that it has a real world use besides speculation.
