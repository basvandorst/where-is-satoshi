You've completely missed the point. You sell when the price is high and buy when the price is low. Assuming that whatever your rebalance schedule is has a rebalance slated for today then you would just do whatever is required to get your holdings back to that 10% number. Since everything is crashing, that would likely be buy more, but that depends entirely on the 10% number and where your current holdings are in relation to that.

Said expert won't mind putting in their entire life savings then, right? 
Oh, he won't do that? Why are we listening to him then?

This is basic investing strategy for the long term. What is your alternative? Buy anytime it 'feels' low and sell when it 'feels' high? Sell now in a panic?
The high from 5 years ago for BTC is $1.2k. It sure felt high back then, but looking back on it, anyone who sold everything back then is certainly seeing now that it was actually a "low" point that they cashed out. 
Remove emotion from the equation. For example, rebalance at market price every Monday at 1pm. Don't even look at the price, just make it so that it is back to 10% of your portfolio.

It was a huge celebration because people caught holding the bag during the last upturn were able to pass the bag to someone else and make a bit of profit.
It is the end of the world now because all those currently holding the bag are seeing a 50% drop in their "investment". 
If they hold, they will likely be celebrating in a few years when it hits $25k because they finally can make some of their money back and profit by passing the bag on. 
Most won't be strong enough to hold though and the cycle continues.

Which, surprisingly enough, can also include some Crypto!

It should be a percentage of your total investments and at regular intervals, unrelated to value, you should be rebalancing your investments so that it hits that same percentage.
So, if BTC if 10% of your investments and each month you rebalance, when it is 20% of your investments after a good month, you sell back down to 10% and put the proceeds in your other investments which are down or up less. The following month, when it is 5% of your investments you buy back up to make it 10%.
A couple people might get lucky waiting for the right time, but just remember those people "got lucky" when they sold off years ago at $1200. It is never the right time to buy and it is never the right time to sell (unless you are from the future) so might as well buy and sell consistently.

Same way did: Making up bullshit to support whatever view I have on the coin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:46:26
Actually I calculated the value to be $150 a coin, maybe $200 if you account for the increase in users and future markets inclusion.

Abstract idea lazily converted to "action plan" with very little details about how much coin is needed, who will be trusted with the coin, the logistics of getting the items out to the different venues, who will be handing these items out and what happens to the coin if the goal is not reached.... What is this ?
In that case: +100 doge verify
Actually wait... I take that back. If this were there would be about $250 fiat equivalent in tips to the OP already!

I'd donate if Gorilla's were handing all this stuff out.

I see where you are coming from, but expecting paypal to pass the savings on to the customer is a stretch in my mind. They will accept it like any other currency using their existing fee structure.

...and yet, not so very far away.

If you are living paycheck to paycheck I would highly suggest not gambling with BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:48:10
Agreed, but we've also had a lot of poorly planned stuff as well, this being the most recent example: 
It is just strange to see something like this in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:14:50
Treat the money as gone and hold for the long term. If you are truly investing only that which you can lose and you believe in the bitcoin, you'd be stupid to cash in your losses at any point.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:47:14
Why did you sell?
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:36:58
I'm a proud supporter of dogecoin, but I'm still allowed to make fun of the way we go about doing things, especially when those unorthodox style methods get upvoted in the bitcoin sub!
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:57:29
Well he is certainly not going to be telling people to sell while he is holding, lol.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:38:35
Perfect, take some of your cash you've got left over from your previous paycheck and invest it now while it is low instead of waiting for your next one.

Uhhh... I thought a huge selling point of Bitcoin was that you could transfer money worldwide fairly quickly and with very little fee? If Paypal takes Bitcoin they are still going to charge their fees.
It would help for bitcoin adoption, but moves Bitcoin further from its roots as a competitor that might force Paypal to lower their fees.
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:51:46
So then when I pay with Bitcoin I get the 2% fee + the bitcoin fee. Which is no different than Bitcoin having a fee and credit card not.

Your parents are just going to change it to fiat immediately, so why can't the renter (who I would hope is more informed then your parents) change it to fiat and pay them in cash?

Guitarist for Tool is the lead proponent of the lizard men theory? That actually doesn't sound wrong, though I think you mean Alex. :)

Fuck it, I can never see them when they are playing anyway and they both hold guitar looking things when in silhouette.
