I believe I was responding to you saying something bad about another user.


I did zero digging.


You did that yourself.

Your gains AND losses are proportional to your investment.
You buy $10 of BTC. Your neighbor buys $10,000 of BTC. The value of BTC rises from $10,000 to $20,000 BTC/USD. You have both gained 100% profit.
If you both held your BTC, but the market dropped to $5,000... you would both have losses 50% of your initial investment.
Would you feel sorry for your neighbor who lost $5,000? Would you be happy that you only lost $5? Would you feel just as bad as your neighbor?
Honestly... you sound a bit jealous that people are making large gains on "magic internet money" and you can't because you don't have the initial capital. I mean this as an objective outsider.
Disclaimer: You shouldn't invest money that you can't afford to lose.

I'm curious about when the cutoff for non-taxed/taxed is. This was announced late '17. What about trading done before the announcement?

Yes, but "they" wouldn't have a reason to go beyond 7% per day. If they push it close to 7% it could organically go beyond that threshold.
*IF* "they" wanted to do it intelligently, it would probably happen in small increments over a longer period of time to maximize profits.

A retailer can set whatever price they want. It is up to the consumer to price check. Generally speaking, if someone(or some company) doesn't see a problem being deceptive in one regard, they won't see a problem being deceptive with regards to other acts.
I'm not saying that Kohls is doing anything else nefarious. I just choose to not deal with entities that I view as deceptive or feel that they have to stoop to deceptive tactics.

I wasn't excluding any system. Percentage based systems are specifically in favor of larger wealth pools.
Edit: I assume you meant "more money = less gains."
Edit: "less money = more gains"
If you calculate the gains on a percentage of current wealth then an equal, linear gain (working for the same wage) would yield a higher rate of increase vs wealth for the entity that has less money. 
Conversely, more base wealth would yield a lower percentage increase.
These are perceived values though. The gains are the same.

In the labor force system:
There are two workers that make the same wage per hour. Worker A has $10,000 to his name. Worker B has $100,000 to her name. Over the course of a week, both workers give the same amount of their time and they have both earned $1,000.
They have both gained $1,000, but...
Worker A has a gain of 10%.
Worker B has a gain of 1%.
Thus, Worker B has gained less while gaining the same amount as Worker A.
In the investing system:
There are two investors... let's just call them Worker A and Worker B. Worker A invests $11,000 into BTC. Worker B invests $101,000 into BTC at the exact same time/price as Worker A. Over the course of a week, the value of BTC rises 25%. Both investors exchange their BTC back into U.S. dollars to go to the strip club. (They use a sweet ass exchange that doesn't charge fees. You've never heard of it.)
They have both gained 25%, but...
Worker A now has a gain of $2,750.
Worker B now has a gain of $25,250.
Linear gain in currency vs perceived percentage gain.

Well you see, my grandmother has been ill and the doctors say she doesn't have much time left. She owns five Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler dealerships in the southwest, and I'm all the family she has left. I moved in with Grandma to take care of her and to rent out my condo to help pay her expenses. I could sell the condo back to the owners association, but the renters signed an agreement for two years. I'd really like to help, but I need to come up with $2,125 USD to sell the condo. The association has already appraised the condo at $250,000 current market value. It was recently painted and the master bathroom was retiled.

I am not Theo Chino, and what do you plan on accomplishing by suing the "great" state of New York regarding the Bitlicense? Why do you need to tell people? Will other people knowing what you are doing have any bearing on the outcome of your case, or are you just seeking attention to further your political career?

Hmmm... I just Binged "the internet." Cute idea, but I doubt anyone would use it.

The Big Bang Theory is using "dorks" to laugh AT like a sideshow. Though I've never watched Silicon Valley, the bits I have seen are directed toward tech culture to laugh WITH.

BitChain or Bcash?

Why would you sell BTC for cash? This comment doesn't make any sense.

Is ketchup a dip just because you dip fries in it? Is honey mustard a dip because you dip chicken in it?
I say, "NO!" Anything *can* be used as a dip, sure. Does that mean it needs a label following it around the rest of its life? Ten years from now will salsa be able to get a job other than low paying menial dip work? We need to rehabilitate these condiments so that they can become productive members of the nutritional program. I see some salsas whoring themselves on the shelf next to cans of french onion or sour cream and onion, and it makes me cry. Not because I put them there, but because I didn't do anything to stop it from happening. We are all culpable to the injustices that salsa has had to deal with. Together we are  Thank you.

So, this guy correctly called that "Bitcoin would recover from this low" which is basically calling a cointoss (50/50 It will either recover or not recover) and now he can tell the future of Bitcoin? My father's brother's friend's son-in-law said that Bitcoin would recover from this low, but that was after he tried to talk to me about a magical zombie carpenter in the sky.

Thanks. I've made a few BTC memes, but the mobile app never let me upload them directly or post a link. I decided this one was worth cracking open Chrome to post.

I hadn't checked the price in about week. The jump made me think, "Someone out there is dusting off their Vegeta meme." My interns made a few mockups, and then the art department did the rest.

A 0.003 BTC haircut done April 5th, 2018 is still a 0.003 BTC haircut done April 5th, 2018 come Q1 of 2019. Just don't move that BTC, and it has no fiat value... right?

I agree with this.
The cost of the service was in USD. You were given "X amount of" BTC worth $20 current value at the time. If you put it on an exchange and use it to trade... that's a different story.

My name is not Theo Chino, and I think Theo Chino has Online Asperger Syndrome(OAS). OAS has gone undiagnosed for decades. Chances are you or someone you know is suffering from it, but honestly the real suffering is done by those that come in virtual contact with a person who has OAS.
Please think before you internet.

I saw the post by chance, but don't care enough to even Bing your name because of your methods. I don't reside or do business in NY, and have only cursory knowledge of what Bitlicense is.

Just go one step further and use the exchange APIs to trigger trades instead of alarms. Then add the ability to store kline information, calculate moving averages, and base the triggers off of close values above/below trend lines. Narrowing in the buy/sell price based on the trend acceleration would need some fine tuning... looks like the basis for a trading bot.

What is your trading strategy. This should be a clear, set definition... as in, "When the BTC/USD 1h kline closes below the wma10, I sell. When it closes above the wma10, I buy." If you are trading with your feelings or instinct, you are going to lose your BTC.

So, you've bought some BTC?
Do you still have the same amount of BTC that you purchased?
