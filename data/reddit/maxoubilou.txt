So what about the peoples not liking the dollars ? This is fair as some don't like bitcoin.  
Dollars or other fiat are stones with no emotions.  
With Bitcoin smiles come from the users, with fiat smiles come from the persons waiting to you at the bank office.

It's not just about to do $400B/21M BTC.  
I have 10 peoples and 10 apples sold in a $10000 market cap.  
Scenario 1: We are in a perfect world - we share the apples. Each buy 1 apple for $1000.  
Scenario 2: We are in a market - 2 peoples buy 8 apples for $2000. The 8 lasts will have to fight for 2 apples at $4000 each.  
As we are probably more in the second scenario, the day after the market cap reach $400b, the Bitcoin price will be higher than $19k, maybe higher than $40k as well.

Is this real ? :p  
 &gt; LEGO enthusiasts who purchase the set are also encouraged to keep up with the real Bitcoin blockchain, as LEGO plans on releasing expansion sets at the rate of about 1 every 10 minutes until the year 2140.

Excellent guide ! Thanks for writing. But I think most of people still don't know what is a Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:03:01
I downvote cause I'm bored of this kind of topic.
Also, they didn't reached 4k as we just got a dump.

Thanks a lot for this link.

Hi, sure bitcoinity and some other charts tools are still a must have. But for fast insta trading (and also because I like to have reactive datas), I like clear tables that showing reveleant datas. I do medium, short and "instant" term trading. For "instant" term I just cannot leave my tool ;) I'll improve it, not by adding a chart but to make it confortable and very reactive.
edit: to understand better what I mean with 'instant' trading, the fact is I have a 2nd app, when I see more than 2-4$ diff I push a buttom that activate a bot doing short sell and buy for me, and as soon as that moving to much I stop my bot. So I just need to watch my tables... and click. It's profitable most of the time. But a good predicition on medium term is still da best ;) whatever, i'm not against some "easy" extras !

It's Gox started the dump. China just had to follow.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:27:26
Thanks for the feedback ;) I'll try to keep it clear and 'easy' to read.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:28:39
fixed it to 1.000.000.000, ty ;)
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:15:05


  
$1b = $1.000.000.000 if i'm still good with maths. With $1b you can buy 1m BTC at $1000, not sure what to think about this =)

You reading right ;) It's very interesting to compare BtC distrib to global wealth distrib.  
And thoses 0.1% keep pumping the 99.9%. Then, they'll pump between themself until only 1 man left.

quoting Operatr from BTCTalk:
"This would be enough to develop an entirely new forum platform, by an entirely new company..."
I'm happy to didn't donate.
Thoses guys have just better to disappear with all this money and start a new life...
If I pay 1 engineer for 10 BTC/month (which is a great pay atm), 7k is enough to have a 20 devs (which is to much devs) team for 35 months.

Well, very bad news for Russian people I guess... but excellent one for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:05:01
Just amazing ;)

I'm bored to meet guys like you thinking selling is noobish.
Selling is a part of the business, you cannot make any waves if noone sell. Peoples that selling are:
1. making money, because they trend, they'll buy back.
2. losing money, because they buy back to late.
The earth was build on volcanus and earthquakes, it's pretty similar thing for every business.

Not mentioning that i'll improve it over the time.
Thanks for your futur feedbacks (hoping so ;)).
edit: working very nice on my samsung galaxy 8.0, you don't need to be connected to btc-e to get data updates.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:19:18
Well, here the global wealth distribution:   
Bitcoin have better distribution than dollars, euro and all other currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:28:22
So I'm interested :D  
I also did my app to get very fast refresh of the BTC-e order book. I'm pretty spamming them because each time I get my update I ask a new one. But the BTC-e server is pretty solid: even on spikes hours I have a refresh every 500-700ms.  
Keep the nice work ;)

From France I can say that Switzerland is very advanced atm on Bitcoin. They are very quiet, but sneaky ;)

Dear iPhone users, I'm happy to see you finally open your eyes on Apple jail.  
Android is very nice, but it's a big work to remove all Google content and replace it. You should feel better with that anyway.

Hi,  
I'm French myself, living there.  
From my own experience, it's peoples don't know yet about Bitcoin.  Medias aren't covering it, gov not really speaking about. Some big guys saying crap.  
It's wrong to think France banning Bitcoin or is really hostile.  
The Bank of France published a note saying they will study more Bitcoin. They are only warning peoples about Bitcoin "danger" and saying shit, like US and some other countries did before they understand BtC potential. But this have no political value. It's just a fat guy in a chair vomiting some words on a paper "blablahhh we don't know bitcoin yet so it's DANGEROUS GUYYYS DONT DO IT OMGFG blablaaaa".  
At the moment I see nothing bad in France about BtC, we are just... late... very late, and nothing helping, even with Bitcoin-Central support.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:15:52
Looks nice, I would be interested only if the refresh rate of the order list is fast.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:25:42
Thank for the link, but are you sure about the hour ? I mean, I'm from EU and I know in USA the timeline is not the same everywhere, their is place with 1h decay.
