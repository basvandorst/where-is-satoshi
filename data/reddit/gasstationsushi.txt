About a year ago, claimed to [bring $125K worth of Bitcoin to North Korea in an iPod shuffle (he did not specify number of bitcoins).](

Silver is actually somewhat resistant to corrosion. However it quite easily forms silver sulfide, normally called 'tarnish'.  This is quite insignificant amounts, though.
Generally the issue with silver currencies losing weight over the years has to do with them being circulated and rubbing against other coins.

Uh. Where are you running your numbers?
136k compounding at 6% for 40 years is $1.39m.
Same amount, over the same timespan, at 8% is $2.95m.

Not bad. Personally, I think the whole idea is a bit outdated, it harkens back to a time when "he who has the most gold, wins", or when debt meant usury levels of interest, or getting paid in credit to the company store. 
The people who are successful in the long-run won't be those who are sitting on gold, silver, fiat, bitcoin or (insert commodity). It will never be people who sit idle, it will be people who are creating valuable goods and services. Those wealth creators won't care whether the world trades trade beads, bitcoin, metal or paper for their goods and services.
