Warning new users is important ---- We need only one currency and BTC is the one!

I was in this space five years ago; I own some alternates, knowing at the time, it was not an investment at all. Some of them are not on exchanges anymore.
Pump and Dump scheme is on this space for years. The only novelty is the huge marketing propaganda machine with ICO; And zero added value.

Bitcoin is 'hard money'. Bitcoin has a deflationary characteristic.
Legitimate Alt-coins are so rare today. On the first 20 coins (from coinmarketcap), 17 are tools to print money (premine, instamine...) or have doubtful 'properties' (centralized, small team controlling everything, misleading marketing...), or both, and so are 'easy money'. A great article to understand what you can do with an inflationary characteristic: [ and where the money goes...
And we need only one 'hard money'. The network effect is important here.

Good interviews. Topic covered: from the economy to the technology itself. Recommended.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:25:32
And this is the reason we are in a bear market. Scams (s\*\*tcoins) are too large now. Bitcoin takes back its shares days after days. Once Bitcoin will be back over 80% we will see...
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:07:13
I sold the few I had, back in December. Legitimate alternates have no future anyway, Bitcoin has all the network effect, and the most advanced development work is done on the Bitcoin repository, and nowhere else.
Most coins on the top of coinmarketcap are not legitimate; these coins are just tools to print money (premine, instamine...), with a small team controlling everything or with unwanted properties (centralized, misleading marketing, low security, poor monetary policy, the full node can't synchronize, tax on the mining reward...). These coins have no 'store of values' properties. The money put there is spent in listing fees and to support the marketing machine. The development side is worthless.
Today we have just a fight between 'hard money', Bitcoin is alone now, and 'easy money'. The market will take his time but the 'hard money' will ultimately win.

No, this is a good think, mining gold is not free, all activities in the real world have a cost.
Bitcoin is secured by the 'Proof of Work', this process is independent of the content of the blockchain, and this is a good thing, you can have your Bitcoins in cold storage, and limiting your attack surface to zero.
The other point mining Bitcoins have a cost you must own the hardware and pay the electricity bill. This anchor the price of Bitcoin to the price of the kWh and to the real world. This is the opposite of fiat currency where printing money is a zero cost process; A zero cost process has the incentive to increase the money supply and this is something we don't want.

Not like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a real 'Store of Value'. The technology is solid, the speculation will not change the trend on a long term basis. Bitcoin is already a 9 years old product.

Fiat is a bad idea; And the gold standard is dead for so long now, but was a good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:26:45
The book 'The Bitcoin Standard' is perfect to elaborate on the subject. And for someone who don't know in the cryptocurrency world where the value is.
And someone who thinks that an 'Alt' presented as generation 2, or better than Bitcoin... is really a competitor, has no idea how Bitcoin operates, and how Bitcoin is developed, and what 'money' is on an economic standpoint.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:18:02
At the time of the Gold Standard the currency was backed by Gold. And, indeed the Gold itself was stored and rarely moved.  This third party requirement was the 'single point of failure' we don't have with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:55:14
I don't think the next bull run is for tomorrow; Maybe when Bitcoin will be back over 70% or 80%, we will see.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:35:43
And this is why Bitcoin look at the 'Austrian Economics' school. Gold was hard money and Bitcoin is hard money too. 
Bitcoin removes the possibility to print money, and this is what we want: A deflationary money, giving again sense to low time preference.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:50:33
Money is not an investment you are right; And indeed this is not Bitcoin which increases over the years. This is just the dollar losing its value relative to Bitcoin. The Bolivar does the same thing at a faster pace.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:53:30
A smaller delay between blocks is irrelevant. You have to wait one hour for a Bitcoin confirmation anyway (6 blocks ; 10mn/block).
And  the 51% attack on some s\*\*tcoins we have seen, is a consequence of a too short confirmation waiting period too.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:31:41
This is the last interview below - And we have an attack too by shitcoiners...
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:06:08
Gold was killed by the states as money at the beginning of the 20th century. Now, we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin is hard money. Bitcoin owns the right features to take over fiat: anti-censorship characteristics (cross-border...), no single point of failure at the protocol level, and by a huge network effect. And a constrained monetary policy.
An article comparing Bitcoin and Gold volume:

Yes so more, with smartcontracts, we have now lightnight the only innovative product fully decentralized and fully innovative for the last five years of the space.
All the last cryptocurencies/ICO are just printing their own money with an unlimited marketing budget; Presenting defectives development choices as cryptocurrencies 2.0...

Indeed a fascinating book, and a great interview at mises.org.
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:15:51
I share your view; The long answer above.
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:58:09
This is not the same. Saving when using an 'easy money' will lose value over the years. Hodling Bitcoin is different, this is a 'hard money' you will not lose anything over the years.
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:31:37
The option: geth ... --syncmode "full"
A full node is the only setup relevant from a security standpoint; Otherwise the blockchain; and the new blocks are not properly checked. If the network is not decentralized; i.e. only a few full nodes are really running; the network is at risk, and can be attacked from the inside.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:16:49
This is not a mindset; Bitcoin is 'hard money', new alts are just scams and 'easy money' at the same time.
Here an other thread:
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:21:35
We can't have full privacy anyway, the method can't scale at the today Bitcoin transactions level. This is the reason why the privacy is optional on the non legit coin (the one with the 20% tax)., and a minimum number of transactions is required for the privacy feature to be effective. Is this the case today? Not sure.
Lightning and Schnorr will improve the situation.
I doubt the money flow is so important today for this use case.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:01:29
No, new alts follow the same philosophy as a currency like the bolivar The 'alt' is just a way to transfer wealth to pay the listing fees, the marketing, and the people controlling the code. These coins have no store of value properties.
On a free market to become a medium of exchange, you have to be a 'store of value' first. Only Bitcoin is scarce, and has a final monetary policy. Nobody can't change it, I hope, that BCASH people learn the lesson now, at their own expense.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:05:57
Bitcoin is hard money; The 'store value' effect gives the rise in value over the years.
Shitcoins are soft money: Only huge marketing, misleading informations and 'pumps' give them any value.
Hard money + Soft money is not a diversification.
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:02:16
For years , we have people who think  they can bet on the next Bitcoin, and Bitcoin itself will disappear
They just failed to understand how Bitcoin works.
New coins now are mainly fork of the Bitcoin repository changed to print money (premine...). These coins have no store of value properties. And are not 'hard money'. Only Bitcoin has the 'hard money' property, i.e. a strict monetary policy and a final number of coins. Nobody can't alter these properties, BCASH people tried and failed.
These coins have a small team controlling everything or with unwanted properties (centralized, misleading marketing, low security, poor monetary policy, the full node can't synchronize, tax on the mining reward...). The money put there is spent in listing fees and to support the marketing machine. The development side is worthless.
Today we have just a fight between 'hard money', Bitcoin is alone now, and 'easy money'. The market will take his time but the 'hard money' will ultimately win.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:55:22
We have a need for sound money. The future will tell - Bitcoin has still a long way to go.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:26:15
Indeed litecoin is a fair coin, and scarce.
The other point is the network effect, like today we have a major currency: the dollar. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency; Bitcoin is the most secure, and everyone in the cryptocurrency space uses Bitcoin. Bitcoin is really decentralized, the blockchain is really immutable, and Bitcoin is really censorship resistant without any single point of failure. The network effect play to favor Bitcoin.
And now we have 'lightning'; 'lightning' has no transaction per second limitation. And allows Bitcoin to become a medium of exchange and a payment system that can scale at the mastercard/visa level....
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:47:19
You should read the book: 'The Bitcoin Standard'; 300 pages from an economical perspective, and with a great history of money.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:15:49
A great book introducing Bitcoin from an economic perspective. The history of money at the beginning is fascinating.
Bitcoin is sound money and Bitcoin is hard money. This book is the perfect demonstration: why Bitcoin is the future, and why other cryptocurrencies are just worthless toys.
A recommended basis to understand the ecosystem.

Your are right now they are a joke; They failed to deliver new generation miners. They manipulate the BCASH market to the upside imitating the brothers Hunt story: [
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:19:13
The best time to dump the BCASH airdrop is likely over. BCASH already tested the 8% level, and moves up again. But the next time we will see...
Now we know that Bitmain owns 1000000 BACH (Q1). A game over event for BCASH is not so unlikely.
Is Roger Ver really believing what he says?
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:27:04
The right word is 'Money' and Bitcoin is sound money. Indeed, your are right Bitcoin is not an unit of account today, but who knows in the Future. You should look at an Austrian economic perspective, this video is quite interesting on this matter: [
Money can be defined as a store of value, that must be divisible and keeping the 'value' in time and space. Bitcoin as a cross-border protocol is pretty good at it. And today better than gold which; with the gold standard; was the money before the 20th century. Fiat currency is only a 20th century trick...
Blockchains can't scale and are slow, this is true. But today we have lightning. This is the payment system, and lightning allows a very fast transaction settlement, and can scale.
Bitcoin is the continuation of money using an Austrian economic perspective.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:29:55
No Bitcoin don't need to become a medium of exchange to survive; Anyway, the scarcity and the free market give to Bitcoin so much value over the years....
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:50:34
BCASH is a failed takeover by a small group - And Bitcoin will stay fully decentralized without any single point of failure, and without any people able to control it.
Gold was the sound money of the past and now we have Bitcoin the sound money of our time.
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:23:22
Indeed this is the book developing and supporting the idea behind this thread.
Gold lost the battle as money in the 20th century. Bitcoin is hard money and is in a monetization process, and has all the right features.
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:29:31
Not yet anyway. The BCASH people tried to take over Bitcoin and they failed. The good news: Now we have the proof that Bitcoin is truly decentralized, and no small team (or big team) can manipulate the Bitcoin protocol to their own advantage.
Now, Bitmain owns more than 1000000 BCASH (Q1), they have heavily manipulated the BCASH price to the upside; And they can't step back. This circus will likely go on until the Bitmain IPO's fails.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:37:31
You are right; But now we have lightning a fully decentralized L2 using smartcontracts and an innovative product. This is a call to remember that all these ICOs are just nonsense and marketing hype. They are just printing money for the team controlling the code, with a massive premine or others tricks. Without adding any value for the cryptocurrency space.
Or stating that code is law and replacing the Bitcoin native language 'script' with 'javascript' adding a lot of software features... No, really, just securities issues and backdoors. The DOA was a remember that only Bitcoin owns a fully immutable blockchain.

Etherum with its &gt;1TB blockchain collapse under its own weight. The last dev meeting won't save them.
