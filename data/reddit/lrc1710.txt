Its pretty obvious that if you do not have the new tech ready, the reasonable decision is to make the room larger to accomodate for the current demand, until the newer tech is ready.

And this my friends, is what happens when you brainwash good people.

Say you're a company that needs to buy some materials, say those materials will come from China by sea, it'll take months for them to get here, and you have to exchange your $ to Chinese Yuan to make the order, that is a risky move for your company cause 1st: you're putting a lot of cash into something you won't see for months, and 2nd, the exchange rate between $ and Yuan might swing in such a way that by the time you get the materials, they were now cheaper and you paid a higher amount. 
So a futures company makes the order for you, if the price swings in your favor, they take the profits, if it swings against you, they take the loss, but in any case you only pay when the materials arrive so even if the price swings against you, you're still paying what you originally were willing to pay , and also you didn't get low on cash for months cause you only payed when the materials were already here.
So it's basically a bet in the exchange rate of some asset currency or comodity, but depending on the scenario it might favor both players, one economically and one logistically.
EDIT : in this case you bet on whether Bitcoins price will go up or down

Such sillinessfrom you guys... Roger is a smart guy doing marketing moves, I encourage you to keep calling it "bcash" as a marketing response, let the market decide what it will be called in the long run...

This is so dumb, basic economics dude people will pay more for faster transactions, the only way to fix that is to make the network faster so there's no need to overpay for speed... And I don't see the LN being ready anytime soon, nor wether or not it'll be any good.

UASF and all the Twitter mob promoting it was painful to watch and an embarrassment for Bitcoin

Government officials already control the big majority of mining in the country, they have entire facilities to mine BTC and other coins, they ARE moving into crypto.

They already did, we went from having 100 Bs as the largest bill, you needed backpacks of those to pay for stuff in cash, right no the highest is 20000 Bs as the highest, with that you can now pay for a cheap lunch. But ofc all that printing brings inflation and prices will keep going up until eventually you wont be able to buy anything with that 20k bill just like you can't now with the 100 one, I used to be able to buy food for a week with that 100 Bs bill 5 years ago, and now its worthless

Most of them, mainly ZTE, Huawei and BLU devices, they're kinda of affordable and check all the basics, and most people have basic data plans that work decently enough.

Banking system works pretty well tbh, if the cab driver or restaurant owner has an account in the same bank as you, the wire transfer is instantaneous. When you wire to a different bank, if you do it in the morning (before 9 am) it arrives in the afternoon, if you do it past 9 am it arrives next morning, and if you do it on weekends it arrives monday morning, but all you do is take a screenshot of the receipt and send it to the person thru whatsapp, then they have peace of mind and can track the transaction. However some people only accept transfers from the same bank so they don't have to be tracking when its going to clear.
You are only allowed to have bank accounts in Bolivares, all the trading in $ happens thru foreign banks, I have BoA for example which I opened a few years back when I went to LA, but people travel to Panama or Colombia or Spain and other countries and open Bank accounts there. 
The Bolivar is so worthless that its virtually impossible to buy anything of value with it, all real state or cars and other expensive properties are traded in foreign currency, meaning its very risky cause for example If I sell my car to you, legally in Venezuela Im giving it to you as a gift (or im selling it to you in a Bolivares sum thats worth very little just as a placeholder) and I trust you to pay me thru the foreign bank. So generally people always try to find those things thru people they trust, friends, family, or mutual friends in order to not get scammed.

As a Venezuelan that still lives here, bitcoinization is extremely unlikely, most people don't even know what bitcoin is, a dollarization is much more likely but still far away, it is big business for government officials to have a dual currency state in which themselves and rich people trade in $ while middle class and poor people trade in Bolivares. And yes I do wire money to the restaurant owner a lot, but in many places you can still use your debit card. Most people have smartphones that are very cheap and come from China from companies like ZTE, Huawei, etc and the government subsidies them. So wiring has become the norm, specially for Taxis, there'sno cash to pay for the ride so you wire the money to them.
Feel free to ask any questions about Vzla. Crypto is strong here amongst the people who know about it but it isnot widely spread yet.

Not really, I mean its very rare, real state business is all in $. 


tuinmueble.com.ve is the most popular, is like an eBay for real state, just like tucarro.com.ve is the same but for vehicles. But you'll mostly find houses and apartments that are already built. In order to buy early into some of the buildings that are under construction you gotta talk directly to the construction companies.


Yes it is, luxury construction is incredibly high, because labor work is so cheap (workers get paid in Bolivares), building luxurius stuff is very profitable, whereas building smaller projects for middle class citizens is just not happening cause people can't afford it, middle class apartments and houses are at an all time low (you can find very good apartments in Caracas for 30k$ for example) meanwhile luxurious apartments cost 1-5 MILLION dollars and they get sold like hot cakes. Its really bizarre, its like 2 completely different countries existing in the same land.

Mining bitcoins IS NOT illegal, there is no regulation about mining, but since electricity is subsidized, mining its very very cost efficient so many people are doing it, those who have small rigs are OK so long as they stay low profile but those who want bigger farms get caught and the govt takes them to mine themselves. They shouldn't be able to sinsce there is no regulation but they do it anyways cause they do whatever the fuck they want, and right now they control the big majority of the mining rigs in the country.

This doesn't make any sense, but every single thing in the world is a new opportunity to shill Bitcoin and say it's gonna solve all our problems right?
I'm outta here.
