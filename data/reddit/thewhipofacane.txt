B b but but you said REAL investor don't put money in crypto indicating crypto fundamentally is a joke?

Did you forgot what Goldman CEO said and did? You said environment has changed, but did you see the fundamentals are actually getting much better this year during the bear market? Prices sometimes never reflect fundamentals, especially in such markets.

Remember there is trading and there is investing, a traders job is trading the price action and a investor is invest base on knowledge and probability. You are a moron for generalising all the markets participants way of profits in the market. For you it is not an investment, but for me it is a high risk investment (not all investment needs to be low risk).  Some people are good in trading and some are good in holding. You says dreams and blind hope then you dont know JACK SHIT about blockchains and cryptocurrency (im not nesscesarily defending btc). Go back and focus on your support and resistant stop bashing shit you dont know about. If you invest price cannot always reflect fundamentals so stop mixing trading quotes with investing babbles.
We got pump and dump all the time in the stock market. Are you blind?

My friend, you obviously have no experience in the stock market at all. It is better to watch and keep an open mind
