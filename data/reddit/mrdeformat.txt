Stay calm, you just contradicted yourself there suggesting the BTC millionaires would cash out, that wouldn't make sense if the currency is being devalued.

Just figure out where he keeps his gun, so he can’t get it when he needs it, little bit of planning and the guns useless

Regular folk always get hung up on how much 10k is worth now, but don’t always connect that if nobody had made that first transaction, bitcoin would be worthless now.

Not really because there’s no panic of a crash because the markets healthy, it’s just overinflated, might see a correction but there’s no investor panic at the moment, business is doing well.
