I never wrote anything in the op. My question is clear from the topic

as i said, my cryptos are on paper wallets, which i generated offline with my ubuntu stick. but there is no way in hell i will completely switch away from windows, because for everything but cryptos, I just prefer it, because its much more userfriendly

How is this working for amounts like 0.16129 btc? how can i store them regarding private keys?
How can I just use a paper wallet by just writing it down and putting the sheet somewhere?

sorry, my life doenst evolve around cryptos.
I wanna be able to play games, install any programme i need as fast as possible and do pretty mainstream stuff - and all that without writing the matrix. 
I have my ubuntu stick for wallet creation, otherwise its windows

ah, so u think by posting on reddit u had any kind of influence, so that u deserve to break promises?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:17:33
as i said in the OP - it is not primarily about finding the best technical solution. maybe 2x is not perfect, maybe it has some downsides.
it is about building a foundation, which can solve future problems. If you now break your promise, how do you expect things will play out in the future, when we reach another point with opposing opinons?
This segwit2x can show, that the whole btc-community can work together and accept compromises

well, as long as slush pool says no, i dont believe this. slush was always like the biggest speaker in favour of segwit, so i am sure he will do
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:24:17
if only slushpool signalled from the very beginning. would be easy lock
