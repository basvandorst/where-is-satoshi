well clearly they are abusing subsidized electricity. it's no wonder they are being charged. this is no different from the posts we get on the beginner's sub-reddit from people who have "free" electricity and want to know if they can make money from mining. we tell them that the electricity is not going to remain free if they start abusing it.

no that's not the metric used. other banks don't even have "members". maybe you mean customers?
market capitalization, profits, deposit base are the sort of metrics used. for example they make $24 billion a year in revenue which is like the profit a major bank makes in a year (revenue-expenses = profit)

Thank you for your answer. I have one more question.


Why would a blockchain be better than a relational database in this scenario?
@_date: 2016-03-16 17:29:52
resulting in a fall in demand for blockchain space which will lead to a fall in fees and lower fees will attract users back to bitcoin and so on. that's how the market mechanism works. demand and supply interact to give us an equilibrium price.

yeah let's not loose our heads. i just wish i had bought more when it was sub 300

Just send from your blockchain.info wallet to an address in your breadwallet wallet (woah).

I'd like to see stats from bitpay. If they are showing increasing numbers then we have something here.
edit: Yes there has been a huge increase:

also not a major bank.

They are breaking the line. They will be pressured by the other banks to fall back into line. It won't be long before they comply.

yes these are compressed keys. bitaddress took a long time to adopt them but it seems it has finally done so.

in that case any and all transaction fees are capital controls. sorry but i don't buy this argument.

I think it's a pretty big milestone for bitcoin when governments start to crack down on it. It was bound to happen one day or the other. Now we get to see if bitcoin can survive. It's a crucial test it has to pass.
@_date: 2016-03-16 17:28:22
How is that capital controls?

no. they have a legal system. it is racist to say think that only courts in the west are worth respecting.

blockchain.info was not deterministic in 2013. electrum and armory were the only two deterministic wallets around back then.

fee increases. free market in operation.
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:10:47
it would be no market without a max blocksize. the blocksize limit exists to protect against DoS attacks.

It's all Obama's fault. He said that not breaking encryption would mean that everyone would have a swiss bank account in their pocket. The people here have decided to adopt that as a bitcoin slogan. They've done this before as well with "You asked for change we gave you coins" drawing from another of Obama's slogans.

Well then you definitely need to sweep the private key assuming you have that. In bread wallet you use the "import private key" option to sweep it:
Sweeping means all the funds in the corresponding address are sent to an address in your wallet. The private key is not added to your wallet and coins sent to its address in future will have to be swept manually.

As a citizen of a pariah state this is what I love about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:36:09
But bitcoin is not regulated so banks will not touch it. Governments will seek to destroy it. As soon as it starts to become popular governments are going to attack it.

Without proof of work can such a database be considered secure?

Internet of Things (IoT) is getting a lot of hype. The idea is that you connect all sorts of everyday appliances to the internet so that they become smarter. For example a fridge that automatically orders stuff when it detects that you are running out. IBM and other tech companies see blockchain technology as something that can be used to register and manage IoT devices. Something like that. 
On top of that there is a meme about no one knowing you are a dog on the internet. A very old meme in internet terms:
So they've combined the two and voila!
@_date: 2016-03-11 18:13:08
So you are saying a blockchain would be more efficient for this use case? It would be faster and/or use less computing resources?
@_date: 2016-03-22 22:05:33
OMG the irony of it all:

The whole bitcoin market capitalization is some $5bn only. If this thing is taking off then you are getting in at the ground floor if you buy now. Apart from that keep in mind that it's still in development and the currency is very volatile so don't go overboard with your investment.
