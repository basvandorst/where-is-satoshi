Well not in this scenario, as you have $0 in your bank account lol.

I don't have anything against bcash or its supporters, but name confusion when its talked about on mainstream leaves a sour taste. It's doing a disservice to the whole crypto world when mainstream bring on people to talk about general Bitcoin and they go off on there own tangents.
Im really happy that the community have gotten behind Andre which now means he is well funded to go do as much talking as he can. About real benefits/issues with cryptocurriences without shilling a specific coin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:22:51
I don't believe so, he was at least giving technical reasoning behind his side. And bcash is just the most obvious shortening of the word to use.
At any rate bcash isnt Roger Ver's.. its decentralised and people can call it what ever they want.

Don't trust, verify. Never follow a link provided or give your details out, go to the website manually and check for yourself. 
Since you haven't provided any credible evidence and are making claims about Skype (which i've never seen any customer service use, not just binance) this is either a false claim or you have been phished (as countless others have said). Please do not spread false accusations like this around it only hurts legitimate claims.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:00:07
Not really it only escalated to that because he was phrasing it as 'bcash' as an abbreviation which is understandable when your having a discussion repeatably using the word 'bitcoin'. You don't have to have any negative sentiments to use it.
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:22:45
I think you've confused it with something else. Segwit is a malleability fix which is needed to make lightning work. They go together.
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:03:50
I would be very happy if we could just move on to another topic, this whole Roger ver / bcash has been done to death.
And tbh, if people would just stop reposting these basically advertising bcash and putting it on footing with bitcoin this whole drama would be over.

Everyone in the world already use a complex currency system that many don't understand, they just know that they can trade this $1 for 'x' value equivalent. I think its a shame financial literacy isnt taught in schools as its one of the most important skills everyone uses through out their lives.

I dont think anyone really knows mate. I finally bought in at $1400 (at the time was all time high) with the same concerns thinking i was too late. 
Whatever price you choose to invest at there is a substantial risk and theres a good chance it will plummet well below that. Get interested in the space and do some research, if you think the technology is going to be worth much higher in the future then it doesn't matter if you buy in at ATH now and theres a few big dips you'll still be better off.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:49:29
Since bitcoins inception theres been people calling it a bubble at every price point. It may very well be in hindsight but no one really knows. If you believe that it can potentially reach higher levels in the future.. it doesn't really matter if the price drops bellow in the short term.
I don't ever like to tell people to buy in. Its your money and you'll have to make the hard choice, but please dont spend anything you cant afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:41:24
All Alt-coins based off of bitcoin were created to do something differently. Thats the point of them and yet they don't use the same name.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:35:28
Is there a reason Satoshi didnt just buy the domain name originally and sit on it?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:07:49
I rarely frequent crypto subs these days, every day its just posts complaining that they havnt had a 2000% return on their 1 month investment (Despite it hitting all time highs).
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:01:05
This fella makes so many contradictory statements and hes only in favour of it if it works out for him but the same rules don't apply to others.
And he describes Bitcoin as not 'p2p digital cash' (as outlined by the white-paper) because of his own random values of what cash is. Correct me if im wrong, but the white-paper doesn't say transaction times are 'x' , having long transaction times doesn't mean bitcoin isn't cash.
It takes the bank 2days to clear my bpay payment for my bills, is that not cash now?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:55:08
Bitcoin core group do not own or control bitcoin, its a github repo consisting of many developers. Bitcoin is controlled by its users and i'm sure if there really was a better scaling method it wouldn't matter what Blockstreams stance on it was.
Everyone agrees that scaling is a huge issue, one that doesn't have a quick fix. Bcash hasn't solved it either at best they've put a bandaid on it (one that also has other problems). 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:11:48
A full bitcoin is a bit of a misdemeanour, theres not really a coin and its confusing because people compare it to our current monetary system. 1 bitcoin doesn't serve the role of our current $1 dollar.
Whether its called bitcoins/bits/satoshi it doesnt really matter, when you exchange one currency you get the equivalent value in the other.
Many bitcoin wallets now show your holdings in bits rather than 'full coins' because the average person buying these days probably dont have many 'full coins' as the price continues to increase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:25:34
Well in the hour since your post BTC seems to be back at the same price as yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:39:02
Well you could pay for exactly the electricity you use as you use it for instance, perhaps automatically payed out by a smart contract. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:03:36
I can only guess they haven't been following it for very long before investing. I had been loosely following for a few years before finally getting in last year, so i had already seen the mt.gox crash and countless market dips.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:16:39
Lightning, side chains, segwit i assume. Could be mistaken but i heard Core was at least for the time being resigning bitcoin to a store of value. There is no quick fix to this scaling issue, a couple of years seem to be used frequently (probably just random number).
@_date: 2019-04-29 00:37:06
Not every crypto currency is the same. They all have their own strengths, weaknesses, values and go about tackling problems differently.


 Subjectively and heavily dependant on what specifically your using it for. Also a bit concerning is whats 'better' seems to be largely shaped by layman opinion rather than actual knowledge (because cryptography is a pretty weighty subject). Its very easy for someone to make a blog post selling hot topics like transaction speeds etc and conclude its better because the layman can understand that.. may aswell have the current banking system.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:57:34
How many things have you told him to buy/spend money on over the years and how many of those panned out? its easy in hindsight to pick your winners.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:57:37
Bitcoin core are not the leaders of bitcoin though and they didnt create another coin. They're just developers working on bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:24:33
Yes its possible, it depends on your bank. But they make their money elsewhere. Not to mention they make money off your money, they hold a small reserve of your money so you can instantly withdraw it and the rest they put to work earning for them.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:16:58
Another thing to consider is that banks take fee's from many places, not just transaction fees, like ATM fees, account fees etc. where as bitcoin ONLY has transaction fees.. which are adjustable.
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:20:04
I guess for one a big pull of Bitcoin is to bank the unbanked, visa/mc only serve part of the population. Then there is the smart contracts etc. and the whole idea the blockchains can be used for more than just currency transactions.. like a web 3.0. Cryptokitties (essentially a game buying pictures of cats) brought the whole ethereum (also mentioned in this article) blockchain to its knees, imagine thousands of apps running on it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:20:52
This is just one way to purchase bitcoin, if you want to do anonymous go with a provider that is prepared to do it so. The main point of bitcoin is to have control of your own money and it not be able for it to be tampered with. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:41:30
I dont understand what keeps incentivising people to mine. Putting aside the optimistic increase in bitcoins price wouldnt miners just move to another coin? (since fees dont change).
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:04:13
Why does it matter what their money is in? ..it makes sense they would have their investment in the asset they believe to be the best, otherwise theyd have it in something else.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:51:00
But thats my point, the fees dont increase and the amount of rewards they get half. Lets say the price of bitcoin doesnt significantly increase to keep up then they will be spending more money than they are earning.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:50:28
At least with more exchanges now batching transactions and higher adoption of Segwit we are better prepared than last year. Lightning and other implementations that are aiming to greatly increase scaling are still in there infancy.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:24:00
Stop the FUD, nobody is claiming the lightning network in its current stage completely fixes the scaling problem.
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:35:45
Probably sarcastically.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:07:45
It doesn't really matter what it was created for, it's up to the people who use it to do what they want with it. And just like the traditional money system people will use it anyway that can to make money.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:14:50
Not exactly the same thing, but in Aus it costs you $2.50 to withdraw cash from an ATM and its pretty regular for places to take a surcharge for &lt;$10 transactions. There are fees all over the place with fiat currencies as it is. I don't think bitcoins fees will have to drop much at all to be as viable.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:09:39
So he's going to have to be very cautious about where he waves his hands?

Didn't see any ETA on the cards in the article, any chance we will be seeing them anytime this year?
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:06:23
So.. a volcano?
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:32:52
How is this different to the current fiat system? Far more resources, time &amp; manpower go into our current financial system which give the same result. 
Id say even from your point of view, crypto currency would be a step in the right direction. Especially down the road when energy is all renewable &amp; we abandon physical cash.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:40:50
Both bitcoin and eth have been fluctuating around these prices for weeks. Theres still awhile to go before August 1st id be surprised if this graph doesn't flip multiple times in between then..
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:55:42
What are they thinking with the pricing on these? its basically the same as the inflated ebay prices of current cards and they're more limited in use.
