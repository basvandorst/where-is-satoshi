Set up multibit and create a new passworded wallet. Use the wallet.aes.json that they email you to import the keys in to multibit and then send all the coins to the new address that you create there.

Was it ever clear when the hack happened? I only applied for verification mid-feb when I was (greedily) looking to cash in on the low BTC price.

Did they say when the database and documents were taken? Before or after the final meltdown?

If it is a phishing exercise they must know something because it wouldn't let me access with the wrong credentials.

it works well online because a) it's got a high level of trust between people already invested in it, and b) it's immediate and (fiat) currency neutral. So i dont have to worry about the transfer from GBP to AUD to buy that software or whatever.
there are 2 issues with adoption in the "physical" world (which i'm sure will get resolved over time): first, the infrastructure isnt there. This is why NFC didnt (yet?) take off, but it's getting there. The second is that when i walk in to a shop, neither i nor the shop have any idea what the item is worth in bitcoins. So how do i buy it? it's a gamble both ways.

0.40/KWh is very high. Are you confident you'll break even?
