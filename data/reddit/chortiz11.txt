Hey man, i bought btc on coin.mx a couple of days ago. They have frozen all bitcoin withdrawals due to the ddos attack going on. It's annoying as fuck.
Here is the email they sent me

Hey don't worry, 
All major exchanges currently have a freeze on btc. You'll get the money eventually or btc eventually, don't worry. I just read a few minutes ago that they are about to relaunch so you should expect something to happen soon
