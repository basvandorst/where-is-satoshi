Why keep full node costs down if transactions will be expensive?
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:59:52
No call here - 10k was "moon" for us.
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:05:35
Wow, r/bitcoin has fallen a long way.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:19:24
What's interesting is this model is predicting $50 million in today's dollars.
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:42:15
e.g. Why wouldn't I open a node to Coinbase instead of Starbucks?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:05:27
Well in a sense, any increase in the price of BTC *is* inflation of the currencies paired to it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:41:40
Why would a node open a channel with them, and not a node with an existing channel to them and others?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:09:37
That number is a quadrillion, roughly the amount transacted by the SWIFT payment network per year.
@_date: 2018-09-26 03:28:25
No, the Lightning Network is supposed to be trustless.
Also it can't scale.
Also Dan agreed with Satoshi after reading a referenced post.  
Edit: a word
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:11:31
I guess phrased another way, how are merchants able to withdraw from the Lightning Network to get on-chain BTC?
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:41:12


I write about your first point here: [
and the second is exactly why the [model]( uses the [equation of exchange](

from his companies to keep them liquid\*
@_date: 2019-03-15 03:09:31
They can't afford the fees.
@_date: 2018-10-20 08:48:08
All we have to do is create alternatives.
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:25:45
You'll have much better luck posting this is r/btc.
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:00:58
I mean... what else were they gonna do?
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:58:36
r/btc supports Bitcoin Cash which actually follows the whitepaper.
Edit: They also believe Bitcoin should be spent (and replaced). For reference, the lead developer of Open Bazaar, Chris Pacia strongly favors Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:55:53
Then what the fuck is it there for?
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:01:36
High fees will make banks necessary.
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:51:56
Lol they're not going to get any donations now cause BTC isn't supposed to be spent
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:53:11
Miners update the multiple entry ledger that is the Bitcoin blockchain.
They guess numbers which satisfy an equation whose difficulty is set by the software every miner is running. The difficulty scales with the number of guesses being thrown at the equation.
When a miner finds a number which satisfies the equation, they are allowed to propose a new "block" of transactions which is appended to the blockchain if it is accepted as valid all the other miners.
They are rewarded with newly minted bitcoin - a set amount which gets cut in half every four years. Other miners can also reject a block if a miner tries to "pay themself" too much like this - this is how inflation is kept in check.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:10:32
How exactly do you do that?
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:25:31
Visa and Mastercard are companies.
Bitcoin is a currency.
You're talking apples and oranges. I've done the math. MoE is far more valuable than $7 trillion.
Google MV = PQ if you're interested.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:13:02
Not even close.
If Bitcoin replaced the SWIFT network it would be worth 10-20 million dollars, today's USD value.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:11:20
Africans aren't going to bother with 50 cent fees.
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:53:37
None of these cool things matter if the fees are $50, and all of them can be done more cheaply on other coins.
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:59:48
per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:14:04


So was I. You clearly don't know either public companies or currencies are valued. It's fine - [here's the math]( for Bitcoin's MoE valuation. Here's [how to value cryptocurrency](
Cheers - hope to see you in r/btc someday.
@_date: 2019-02-12 00:41:15
Semantics. Redefining 'usage' doesn't change the economic reality that things derive value from utility.
Whatever value Bitcoin has from it's 'utility' as a store of value pales in comparison to its potential value as a medium of exchange. Not only are store of value advocates missing the point, they're losing themselves (and the rest of the world) money by delaying the adoption of sound money.
@_date: 2019-12-20 14:49:49
That's because this is an old note.
From when Bitcoin supporters cared less about steaks and more about using Bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:53:42
Wonder why they picked Ethereum.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:09:33
Sounds like the [Greater Fool Theory]( at work.
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:10:06
I mostly hear that from younger women.
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:55:24
The time equivalent of a baker's dozen.
*18 months*
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:41:14
Almost like the market has zero fundamentals behind it
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:59:51
Wow, one whole bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:10:29
How exactly?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:24:14
It moved to r/btc
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:42:49
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:51:32
Prove it.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:02:23
Bitcoin is not for spending.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:04:41
Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin added Segregated Witness and is using the Lightning Network to scale.
Bitcoin Cash increased the block size, and has been following the Bitcoin white paper for guidance in development.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:58:08
Is there evidence to the contrary?
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:23:43
