Given your track records, it is highly unlikely you will end up at a branch of a Federal Reserve Bank and not at the Board of Governors.


A **3** day session is highly unlikely.

Hi Erik!
I agree that the statutory language: "unnecessary adverse impact" is not as crystal clear as a python directive.  But fortunately, whether a new regulation's adverse effect on jobs is necessary or not is to be determined jointly by the Department of Labor and the Department of Economic Department, and not by the department that's proposing the new rule (such as DFS).  That's why we submitted the letter to the two departments.
Secondly, weirdly enough, there are actually legal definitions for what constitute "impact on employment opportunities" and "**substantial** impact on employment opportunities," respectively:
**impact on jobs or employment opportunities** means a change in the number of jobs and employment opportunities, including opportunities for self-employment, primarily attributable to the adoption of a rule, which would otherwise be available to the residents of the state in the two-year period commencing on the date the rule takes effect.
**substantial adverse impact on jobs or employment opportunities** means a decrease of more than **100** full-time annual jobs and employment opportunities, including opportunities for self-employment, in the state, or the equivalent in part-time or seasonal employment, which would otherwise be available to the residents of the state in the two-year period commencing on the date the rule takes effect.

Please tweet or post about this petition letter if you agree with its contents.  We put lots of research and drafting efforts into it.
Thanks so much.

One of the greatest successes she could achieve is to convince **federal** legislature to make sensible law for virtual current that preempts all state laws.  Asking virtual currency businsesses to get licensed state by state is crazy.
What the community can do is to convince virtual currency businesses to underwrite (fund) the Chamber of Ditigal Commerce that she heads.
