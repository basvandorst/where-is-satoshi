Lol. Zoom out and look at the enormous growth of Bitcoin during the last four months.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:56:12
Yes and despite of all this we are still higher in market cap than at the 1st of January. I still think this will only be a small bump in the road in the long run. Look at the time when China banned cryptoexchanges in September and look where we are now. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:12:02
You don't even need news. Go to coinmarketcap, look at the global charts and zoom out. Look at the last month, or even the last three months. Look at the enormous growth! You really think this is going down? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:53:26
I agree, it's unlikely that the future contract play a big part. The problem is that there is still very little liquidity at exchanges, which means that you only need maybe 10 to 20 million dollars to impact the price a big deal. I have noticed several times, especially at Gdax, that a quick sell off leads to a chain reaction. A few very big whales/institutional investors dump a couple of millions worth of Bitcoin which leads to a lot of stop loss limit orders to be activated, which drops the price even more. After some time there is a quick rebound in which these whales buy their bitcoins back at lower prices. You would be amazed to see how little money, relatively speaking, you need to fill a large part of the order book at Gdax for example. It doesn't really help to see so many new investors panic selling all the time.

True. Crypto is growing and growing. Crypto is disrupting a lot of industries and people in power. Don't think for a second that they won't react at all. But if this is really a movement of decentralization and openess and including people who have been left out of the banking system or people that are being repressed in their countries, then in the end we will reign supreme. And if you are only interested in making money, there are positives as well. Binance has accepted a limited amount of new users again, 240.000 in one hour! This shows the demand is real. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:39:50
You must be joking right? The year has only just started and we are still quite a bit higher in total market cap than on the 1st of January. Furthermore today we are experiencing a severe overreaction to some news that isn't even true. Look at the bright side. Futures are already trading on Bitcoin, etf's will follow. Exchanges have applied restriction on accepting new users because of high demand. Look at the broader picture.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:06:02
About four hours ago there was a huge sell-off in a 5 minute candle which lead to a sudden 3% drop, that was reinforced by more panic selling later on. No objective reason, like more news, for this drop. For the big guns it's not even hard to arrange this kind of manipulation at different exchanges simultaneously. So let these guys play their game and wait for stabilization.

The future markets often have very little impact on the rates of commodities. It could be that, because they have only been launched very recently for Bitcoin, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy at work. But I'm not too worried, because I'm very bullish on the space. I would never engage in future trading, but if I would perhaps I would have went short on bitcoin for this month as well. I mean a correction was bound to happen. We went from 2950 to almost 20000 in three months!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:03:22
We went from 3000 to 20000 in four months. We are still way up if compared with one month ago. We are in a downtrend for one week and you are already talking about a multi-year bear market? No one knows for sure, but this year many things have happened to the cryptospace and it has openend to the general public and to institutional investors as well. Just relax and give it some time. Corrections are healthy and there have been many before. This time there is some news involved about South Korea, but as I far as I can see that's not too much of an issue. But again and again a lot of panic-selling especially at Bitfinex and Gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:00:25
It is certainly possible that there is a lot of algorithmic (automated) trading at work. However I don't get your point with regard to the 1:1 correlation. If BTC drops hard usually altcoins go along. Altcoins however drop harder and make a much stronger rebound. But this is true for quite some time. So how is this different than before?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:55:02
It should show up in your ledger quite quickly. Even if it's not confirmed yet. You can try clicking the 'refresh' button. However exchanges like GDAX might take some time do process the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:17:28
I can see that, but don't worry. It's due to the exchanges. But if you send from wallet to wallet it shows up almost instantaneous. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:22:09
To clarify, I meant crypto in general (when I started my argument). So that involves more than Bitcoin, more about all possible applications of blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:42:54
So why do you want to buy at lower price levels when you are so bearish on Bitcoin?  I mean the way you sound, it seems like you are not really expecting a rebound, or do you? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:17:22
I'm not claiming that Bitcoin is a form of charity. It's not only about personal freedom, it's about humanity. You really think that we can achieve personal freedom without securing this personal space one way or another as a society? If Bitcoin equals individuality, we will lose to governments and other hierarchical entities in the end. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:45:34
So why do you buy altcoins now, when you expect Bitcoin to drop even more? It would be much better to wait a bit (because altcoins will drop even more), especially because you are so good at predicting the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:36:03
I agree, we shouldn't blame people for having particular reasons to be in crypto. And it's possible to have multiple motives. I do think it's important to raise awareness sometimes. This is the daily discussion thread of bitcoin and I think you would agree that the discussion is mainly about the price on the very short term (and not even about long term potential). I worry about the longlivety of this ecosystem of this remains to be the case. I sometimes wonder how many people truly believe in this kind of technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:35
Yes, time is so relative in the cryptospace ;). That's why people start screaming about the bubble bursting after one week of correction... after weeks of parabolic growth!
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:40:05
That's a safe bet. I do expect a significant correction somewhere in the future. For now I would be surprised if we went below 13000 to be honest. I mean the Korea news already doesn't seem to be as bad as some people thought. I do expect an uptrend after the holidays are over. I'm very optimistic about next year, there are so many good developments!
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:18:29
I actually expect 13500 to hold pretty strong. You have to look at multiple exchanges, most are around 14000. The funny thing is that the whole downtrend is most manifest at Bitfinex and Gdax. Gdax used to be more expensive than most other exchanges, but now it's usually on the lower end. The downtrend as far as I can see is mainly due to volume from American exchanges. Maybe related to capital gains before the next year?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:05:04
This has nothing to do with Vitalik, it's about the point he tries to make. I agree with you that we don't need any worshipping, but we should adress the broader issue here. Crypto is about adoption as well, if we can't get people into using it... we will lose in the end. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:50:29
What do you think about this sudden drop? Is it price manipulation or just a chain reaction? I mean, I often notice that in minutes of not seconds 20-30 billion is pulled out of the market. To me it feels like it's an effort to evoke panic selling and buy in cheaper. It's so easy to manipulate a market with so little volume. Or am I reading too much into this? These patterns are very different than in August for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:06:21
Well I am not surprised with the dip per se. But what I notice is a very sudden move of around 30 billion which is pulled out or thrown in the market. Only then the rest follows. This could be due to a lot of bot-trading, but I wouldn't exclude the possibility that a few big institutional investors create some panic to buy in cheaper. With say 50 million you can make big swings in the order books. We don't have any safety measures in the crypto world and a lot of things that are illegal in the stock market are allowed here. But I might be wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:53:39
It's much more important that everone switches to Segwit. This will make fees cheaper and transactions much faster. It's a disgrace that many big exchanges, like Coinbase/Gdax, haven't done so! I have been using Segwit lately and I have very little problems. Although I do agree that they should work on scaling the network asap. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:58:23
He does have a point though. If we want crypto to be a social revolution, we need to talk about societal changes as well. Now most discussion is about the price which makes it more likely that we are in a bubble. We need to focus on adoption as well. Nothing wrong with making money but there is much more to crypto than monetary gain alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:44:42
Please explain what you mean, because I just checked some altcoins and the prices at Binance look normal to me. Not that different from the other exchanges and certainly not the lowest prices.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:06:16
I totally agree. There are so many good developments in the space. And corrections are healthy as are reflections. I mean it's good to rethink your attitude towards crypto from time to time. And sometime just zoom at and look at the chart of the last month for example. Still up by a ton!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:20:48
There is nothing wrong with making money, as I stated before. However if it's only about making money we are losing the bigger picture. Then it's just speculation without any regard for the technology which can change our lives in many ways. Besides a market is a zero sum game, so if making money is the main thing you try to achieve then this means that people late to the party actually contribute to your gains. And yes that's how markets work, but I always thought that crypto is about more than just transfering money from the late to the early adopters and from the impatient to the patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:37:02
Indeed for a few weeks bitcoin dropped while altcoins surged. But this is not that common. The reason was that Bitcoin gained a lot in October and November because of the forks (bitcoin gold and the canceled segwit 2x) and all the media attention (including announcement of the futures trading). In that period alts lost about 40% of their value relative to bitcoin. But they rebounded eventually. What I do notice though, which is in line with your ideas, is that certain drops look coordinated. And I would also say that the alts usually don't rebound that quickly. Usually the Bitcoin dominance becomes higher in correction periods and this time not so much. So indeed it could be that these sophistecated traders use the altcoins very efficiently at the way up. Interesting, food for thought!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:12:38
That's what they do. They mislead investors and claim this is the real bitcoin  - it isn't. They call BTC 'BTC core' by the way. Don't buy into this. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:21:48
I know, but there are strategies to cope with that. For example dollar cost average would have left him in a much better position.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:23:45
Maybe you should rethink your tip again and realize that Gdax is by no means the biggest trading volume exchange (Bitfinex is more than 3 times bigger in Btc-usd trading). It might open your eyes if you know that the cryptomarket consists of more than Gdax.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:44:59
As if being a redditor for x period has anything to do with the fact that Gdax is not the highest volume exchange. And for dominating the market you should at least have the most basic facts straight. Apparently even that's too complicated for you. You're just a lazy armchair commentator at best... 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:22:11
Is there already news about the G20. I thought the real discussions about crypto are tomorrow and Tuesday. I did see an overview of the general stance of the G20 countries towards crypto though.
