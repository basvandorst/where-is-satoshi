Given you live somewhat close to one

The sad thing is friends and family and me have to work like 10 hours per day which leaves you too tired to socialize and have quality time.   
So I have seldom time to meet them. Economic reward seems golden.

I had spent a fair share in these places and had never any problem so far, besides some petty stuff. Its not like everyone is running around with guns and shoot up people and fuck em. 
But we should define the "third world countries".   
\* The Asian ones are usually pretty safe.   
\* European places ok as well.   
\* Latam is a trickier and depends on the neighbourhood and the countries.   
\* Africa  prob should be avoided in most parts but there are some places which are mostly ok.
The biggest problem is always the person itself. Can you keep your mouth shut when drinking booze and some hotties come along.

Same here. We would do it, basically any nice place would be ok.  
The so called thrid world countries are mostly quite nice and safe if you know how to behave. Maybe the rough hoods in brazil and such are harsh, but there are a lot of mellow territorial tax / no tax countries around.   
The part with being somewhat lax and under radar is because when too much people know you have money, you are not safe any more. But as long as you keep it somewhat private, you are ok.

A drop hurts them only if they are unhedged. However, a dollar drop would massively pump BTC and gold to the moon. China is already heavyyy laoded up on gold.  
However knows the Chinese, know how smart they are in business.   
The thing which fucks them atm is the reserve status of the dolar, thats why that has to go away for them to prosper more. Chosing Btc is a good way of doing so and many other countries should follow suit and do the same.

"hose talking loudest against it are those buying the hardest".  
That is indeed pretty true...

About what year will we see the citadels to start being built  and how much BTC you need to live there?

Imagine if pension funds actually do only invest in negative yielding bonds and that the negative yields dont fuck up the banks (which they do).
Then pension funds loose money guaranteed and payouts have to be cut for sure. This will shake the whole confidence of espeically the boomers into the system and are politically hard to do. 
So the arguments for BTC are even stronger besides that you don't have a yuuge counter party risk of holding it compared to cash in bank or some bonds with questionable debtor. 
The OTC runs wild atm and the money shufflers want in. The pension funds are next as they have to, either because they see the yield or because they will be forced by public sentiment.
BTC just did an easy 300% this year, so even if you have tiny money of your portfolio you are way ahead.

this one does not sound right to me tbh.
I prefer the real Bitcoin time traveler

TT did not post for like 3 days.  
I think dip probably it is over just see mmcrypto and their ichimoku cloud video or any other channels.
The runup should becoming clearer once the summer slump laziness is over.
But who knows what is real and what is not. We are just a bunch of anons hanging out on reddit.

Nah, that other post sounded not right and might be an imposter. But I have not read everything.  
What should this Aetherium be for 2020?   
Ethererum being the top crypto sounds questionable for the next half year.
