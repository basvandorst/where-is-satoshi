Coinbase sent me this message...i have discovered a number of people have been sent this and I assure you I am doing nothing fradulent..Thank You for your reply. I will research these and try one. 
 "On Jul 24, 2014 you purchased 0.50 BTC via bank transfer for $305.71. 
Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel this order because it appears to be high risk. We do not send out any bitcoins on high risk transactions, and you will receive a refund to your bank account in 3-4 business days.
Please understand that we do this to keep the community safe and avoid fraudulent transactions. Apologies if you are one of the good users who gets caught up in this preventative measure - we don't get it right 100% of the time, but we need to be cautious when it comes to preventing fraud.
You may have more luck trying again in a few weeks. Best of luck and thank you for trying Coinbase.
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
