What caught my eye is that it's been a one-way thing -- 24,000 coins going into storage, most within the last 6 months, but none going out. Not clear whether this is shady until we get a better idea of what kind of money they are bringing in.

Not sure exactly how they do it, but I'm assuming they start with confirmed addresses associated with a certain entity and work from there. Say A is a known Agora address and it has spent BTC in the same transactions as addresses B and C, which have in turn spent BTC in the same tx as addresses D and E, and so on. -- you can know be fairly sure they are all controlled by the same person. (Unless some kind of sharing/matching mixer is being used, which is unlikely for internal transactions.) I imagine they might also keep track of blockchain behavior unique to certain entities.

I've posted a few times under a different name, but not often. Regular lurker, though. 
Created a new name for this post simply because I'm extra paranoid about publicly speculating about the activities of very rich darknet market admins =)
Totally understand the skepticism/frustration -- no offense taken!

Totally agree their profits have to end up somewhere, and perhaps that's what this is. But considering all of this money is just sitting "under the mattress," the 24k figure doesn't take into account any money the Agora owners have withdrawn to actually *spend* -- for operating expenses, paying admins and themselves, etc. 
That's why I suggested someone try to compare the 24k figure against the total amounts *received* by the Agora wallets -- I'm trying to do that, but having trouble gathering the data with my lackluster coding skills. Maybe Agora truly is raking in enough money for this to be innocent profit taking, but it seems like they'd have to be doing an enormous amount of business considering the sums involved.

That was my first thought, but if that were the case I feel like we'd see a bit more activity in those addresses?
Comparing the total amount pulled into these addresses vs the amount deposited into Agora during the same period will help clear things up -- will work on that when I get a chance today.
