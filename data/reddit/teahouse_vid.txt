The image does not show the sent TX because it was not made with your wallet. As u/dieter_rantel pointed out, your private key was used to move funds out of your address to the scammers address. Did you use your private keys to claim BTG? This happened on Nov 15th of last year.  
If you contact support\[at\]exodus.io , the hack investigation team can help with giving you more information about where your funds went so you can report this to the authorities if you choose.

Which other wallets would you recommend and why is it important to back up a wallet with no funds in it?

Thanks for the recommendation and the Kudos  [**u/oldshorts**]( **, This is Kris from Exodus.**  
Quick point of clarification, Exodus integrates with Trezor. You can use your hardware wallet directly inside the Exodus interface. More info here [  
There is a ton of god info on the Exodus support page and you can reach a live human blockchain expert 24/7 to help answer any questions about the wallet or crypto in general.

Hey there, No assumption needed. Exodus is a wallet you run on your local machine so you own the keys. Unlike  Coinbase, Binance or other centralized hosted exchanges, Exodus is account-less and no-custodial. Your Keys, your BTC.  
And to take it a step further, once your hardware wallet is connected, you need to sign transactions with the device itself. Exodus is only the interface.
