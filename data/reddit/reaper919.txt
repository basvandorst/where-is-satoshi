some crypto's are already quantum resistant, not sure which ones

miner's get paid daily(On most pools) and in bitcoin. You literally just get bitcoin as a payment and so the bitcoin you earn now can be worth way more in the future. 
But yeah, mining does require patience since difficulty can increase.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:55:14
Interesting, that's what they say about r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:58
Bitcoin coin was supposed to be a currency.
Never was it intended to be a "store of value". And store of value is just a fancy way of saying collectible
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:40:57
No confirmed date to implement as I know of.
Though people have been saying soon for the last few years.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:11:53
Nope, you got to pay the fee. 
Lightning network will hopefully fix this **If** it ever gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:11:22
Yeah, it sorta sucks. Any informative post gets downvoted hard, and memes get upvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:52:08
I mean actually block size. Bitcoin has a 1mb block size. This is pitiful compared to Altcoins. 
It also is the reason bitcoin is so slow in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:10:08
Yes, but shouldn't we follow the whitepaper and Satoshi, who supported scaling?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:26:22
Plus the transactions time would make it so they get they "gift" after Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:39:16
Yep, even saw it jump past 200,000 unconfirmed transactions before too. 
It's a huge issue, and why Bitcoin is probably not going to ever be used as a currency in the close future, and for the far future it is uncertain. Nobody wants to scale to make transactions faster.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:27:10
Thanks, I was trying to find something like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:27:43
Bitmain has only accepted Bitcoin Cash for the longest time. 
And they have also sold out within a day before. 
This is just a usual day for us people who buy from Bitmain.
Edit: Also Roger Ver has nothing to do with Bitmain
And Bitmain sold miners before Bitcoin Cash was made too.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:18:08
Then what about a gas based system like Ether. It is working better than Bitcoin and BCH and is handling double the daily transactions of bitcoin(Over 800,000 per day last time I checked). Although a gas based system would call for drastic changes in bitcoin, so actually not very viable.
The LN can be useful but it isn't secure enough. What are you going to do, leave thousands of dollars on the network?
So scaling seems to be a good solution that will allow more transactions for quite a while. It's the best of both evils.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:06:56




That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


Satoshi Nakamoto
He expeted overtime people wouldn't run full nodes, and it is possible to confirm transactions without using full nodes 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:07:36
Well, in its current state it can't. Transactions too slow and too expensive. And it seems like nobody wants to scale either, so long term seems pretty bad also.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:43:41
Interesting. I'll take a look at them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:10:25
Not at all. Like I said before, you don't need to run full nodes to verify transactions, so it won't mean one person will have to download the entire blockchain and verify everything.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:05:13
It's quite funny. People in r/Bitcoin dislike r/btc and r/btc dislike r/Bitcoin
Edit: I pointed out an observation I made, that probably won't correlate with what others think. I do not mean to take side. 
What I meant was that it was funny to me, that both Bitcoin based subbreddits dislike each other.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:16
Yeah, but if demand can't be filled what good is it?
It is technologically worse than alt coins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:23:45
buy an S9, plug it into a powers source, set it to mine on a pool. Send bitcoin mined to wallet. GG, you just helped bitcoin become even more decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:25:02
I wouldn't know. But I mean the hate for Bitcoin Cash on this subreddit is unjustifiable as a whole.
Shouldn't we all be happy that Blockchains are actually being adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:46:06
Yeah, that makes way more sense. It's like comparing a truck with a cargo ship(that is equally as fast) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:17:23
Well, it does have one of the lowest fees out of many coins, plus is already used by many others too. 
They're just adopting it, and using it like a currency like it was meant to be used.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:10:13
But if no one is using Bitcoin, to a point where fees are $0-1 wouldn't it just be a useless collectible?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:50:00
LN will hopefully help, but I feel like it sidesteps the issue. 
You're not using the blochchain to send transactions with LN, only to open and close links. 
I personally feel like it just needs to increse blocksize. Yes, it can be seen as a "short term solution" but at a certain point increses blocksize to the next size would drastically. 
With 1mb Bitcoin can get about 370,000 transactions daily.
With 2mb that doubles to 740,000 transactions daily.
With 4mb that goes to 1,480,000 transactions.
 
8mb: 2,960,000 tranactions
16: 5,920,000
32: 11,840,000
64: 23,680,000
128: 47,360,000
256: 94,720,000
512: 189,440,000(30 million transactions past how many transactions visa makes a day)
So yes, we would have to increases block size a lot, but it would be easier if we do it now, and so with every time we scale we can handle way more transactions than the past block size.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:14
Yeah, join us in r/Ethereun instead. Just don't post post too many memes, lies, or toxic post and you'll be accepted.
Oh wait, that's all that's on r/btc and r/Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:46
"The most daily transactions"
Bitcoin is capped at 370,000 transactions a day.
Ethereum just hit a million transactions in 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:53
And bitcoin is doing it better? High transaction fees with slow transaction time make bitcoin useless **now**. At least bitcoin cash has a short term solution. Plus 8mb blocks will be useful for quite a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:07:38
Are you sure it isn't the bitcoin transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:27:30
It's a combination of the fee from the exchange and the huge fee for Bitcoin transactions. To sum it up you got scammed by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:26
Why not both
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:08:45
Yeah. I'm slightly worried LN will never get added. I heard it was in a proof of concept stage, or something like that. It's not even in alpha yet. 
Edit: [link]( to post
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:30
I mean it actually works and does follows satoshi's whitepaper. 
Maybe you should read it and actually see the similarities between the whitepaper and Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:40
Mine Eth or Monero. Maybe even Vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:22:28
Possibly with Eth. The cards themselves can all be created with the Blockchain but the playing part of it would probably require a centralized system.

Bitcoin cash users don't want to pay a few extra dollars when buying a coffee that costs a dollar
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:26:07
Quadrigacx is a Canadian friendly exchange. Verification is a bit of a pain, but after that it's smooth sailing.

Holy hell, I like Bitcoin Cash but had to upvote this. GG op
