I will give you that. My main belief though is that btc is more in the public eye than ever before, and I'm willing to bet seeing it shoot up creates more incentive for more first time buyers to jump in before it reaches ATH again.

Let's not forget the marvelously decadent after taste it leaves on the pallet. 10/10

It's Friday boys let's smash through that 12k barrier eh?

Seems 12k is our current psychological barrier. Hope to see us smash through to 15k in a few weeks with the bullish trend. Until then I'll gladly keep buying the dips.

I've been meaning to ask why that is? I mean, they already use the Pound over the Euro. Does Europe currently accept the pound without exchanging to the Euro? Or is it just going to be the market collapse scaring people into buying into BTC?

Quick! Flash sale on Bitcoin! Get it before it ends soon!

I agree, I have a set amount that I will always keep in BTC, but I also have a set amount above that, that is specifically for "Get rich quick" opportunities. It's always best to keep some stake in it and I truly do hope to see it one day become a global standard for international transactions.
Hope your retirement is a lavish one thanks to the almighty orange coin.
