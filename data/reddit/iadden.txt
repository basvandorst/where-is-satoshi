I know I'm not a charity but would I be considered? it's to pay off my student loans? We're only looking at $8,000 remaining.

Just taking forever to pay off. Currently working retail, it's a struggle.

Thank you Lord, I really got happy when the song started. I was like, "bro you really don't need to do it!".  Started thinking about how some people are really sick to do stuff like that. Glad you're ok.

If only my paycheck could buy a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:19:58
When I say this, I'm not lying... I really forgot that!

Wish I could afford Bitcoin with a paycheck.   At my current rate, that's 12 paychecks. I need a better job. :-(
