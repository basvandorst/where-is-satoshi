I think it'll die eventually. The creator(s) probably didn't intend for it to become a huge hit. BTC was the first of its kind, so there wasn't much of plan for it to be efficient.

The gov't should fine the shit out of them, remove their tax loopholes, incarcerate the exececutive board for criminal behavior. But we just cannot have that, can we? Nope! ~~Bribery~~ lobbying is legal!

Most money is digital (through central banking) these days. Better idea would be to make your own "bank".

Not to mention all their tax evasion just like Apple. Ooops! I meant "tax minimization". Sorry business and legal majors! (not really)

I remember talking to a Venezuelan years ago, when Chavez was still breathing, that police often bursted into people's homes just to harass them.

It ends whenever you stop using "the cloud" and learn to use backup  drives and frequently changing your long, complex passwords.

One can argue that Bitcoin was inflated by the countless shitcoins being pegged to Bitcoin. It always bothers me so much they peg themselves to BTC.

We have to respect Mr. Satoshi, he's (or they have) been playing 11 D chess since before bitcoin came out. Vast majority of people don't know who Nakamoto really is or what it is.
Genius, Nakamoto. That's some Matrix stuff right there.

Never forget the Republics made the Patriot Act during a Republican presidency. Oops forgot to remember that huh?
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:51:24
Republicans love to deregulate things even if it hurts the employees and environment not to mention Republican presidencies raise the national debt much more. Yeah vote Republican. Eye roll.

IP law is because corporations wanted it obscenely long. How long does copyright last now? the life of the author plus 75 years after they die? IP is ridiculous. Corporate American pushed that on the gov't because they think it fosters creativity and incentive while it just makes monopolies.
Regulation is what helps keep your drinking water reasonably safe from corporate/people waste. Why does Corporate America love deregulation? Cheaper labor, cheaper products. Meanwhile they have some poorly paid workers in shitty conditions thanks to deregulation. Sure, Bitcoin should be deregulated to an extent but then you have to realise that there is a lot of bad actors exploiting people without clear regulations?
