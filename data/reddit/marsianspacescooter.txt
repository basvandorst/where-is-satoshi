And people here wonder why they often are not taken seriously.

Why? Are you invested in BCH?

You actually did not give an answer to the actual issue. The issue is that the infrastructure is susceptible to this kind of manipulation in the first place. But I am somewhat hopeful that this is something that is being worked on.

Did you put your life savings into this? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:17:09
Aaaand the reflipping? BCH just went from 2500 to 1900 instantly.

Then how can a *market* be a pyramid? Is gold a pyramid? The dollar?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:52:02
Of course, that's totally up to you. Good luck.

You don't know where to buy it. That means you are not very experienced with cryptocurrencies.
As you can see it is behaving very strangely. It could correct down to the $20 dollar range again.

It is going back up right now and BCH just went from 2500 to 1900.

You can buy 0.001 BTC if you want to. 
Have a look. People want to buy BTC for a certain fiat dollar amount. Others want to sell it. The market determines the price.

This FUD nonsense is very annoying. Are you so weak minded that it upsets you or why is it such a huge deal to have discussions about these things?

You can get alts like Neo on exchanges: Binance, Bittrex, Poloniex. I wouldn't advise it though. Read a lot more about crypto before you deal with things like that.

Careful though. Many buy LTC to trade it into altcoins. When BTC rises the altcoins bleed.

Honest question: so what changed? Nothing the way I see it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:04:31
Nice, I just saw the price for the first time in hours and bought.

I don't understand your assumption that trading = avoiding taxes.
