I used to be all for Bitcoin, but I now feel that Bitcoin will never take off as a mainstream currency. The problem is best demonstrated by a specific example. If Bitcoin is to eventually be independent of USD or Fiat in general, then how much Bitcoin is an acceptable price to pay for a banana? .001 btc? .0001? Let's just say demend skyrocketed, so .00000000001 btc? That's a lot of zeros... I don't see how that's better than the current system of online transactions. In fact, it seems like a way easier way to get scammed.

Fair enough. So how many satoshis is an acceptable price for a banana?

You miss my point. It's the same idea as asking an American how many cm are in a ft, without looking it up? I mean one could figure it out but it's an arbitrary scale for us. So to suggest that the consumer market could be much better with an unfamiliar scale, leaves me sceptical. what about bartering? What about calculating percentages? It's all rather cumbersome.
