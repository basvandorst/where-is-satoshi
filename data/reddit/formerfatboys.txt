Yeah, got it. Android fought me like crazy on it and I gave up. Just fixed at worst.

I mean, that's fine, but credit card is limited to $100 and was a pain in the ass to setup. 
Bank account is fine too. Except Coinbase doesn't exactly make it clear that it's 8 business days until AFTER you make the purchase.

But like...the new user experience in multiple mainstream exchanges is terrible and not because of fiat money or "the establishment". The sites are shoddy. They communicate poorly. I'll jump through hoops, but when I try to verify my debit card and your system repeatedly fails to work for a week that's on you (Coinbase). This was a miserable experience and I was really interested in figuring it out.  If you're running one of these exchanges that's bad news for growing this.

That makes zero sense. US dollars should be put into the account and $200 of bitcoin should be purchased at whatever moment the cash is available. Or...at least...that option should be there.

haha why March 11th 
edit: ETF approval. I don't see it happening. I can't see the US wanting this to continue. I see the benefits of it if it ever takes off, but it's not good for fiat reserve currency to be supplanted by something that can't be inflated.

That's fine. But then, allow me to load dollars into my account and designate when they turn into bitcoin. Ie, in 8 days the $200 of coin I bought that I need to purchase $200 worth of goods may or may not be worth $200 in 8 days. Great news if bitcoin goes up, but terrible news is it goes down and I have to buy more and then wait 8 more days.  Coinage also didn't really make that fact clear prior to the sale. They also don't have customer service. The system is needlessly opaque beyond what is forced on them by regulators or rules.

There's absolutely zero need for that in any instance.

Amazing. I emailed support immediately after my purchase said it would take 8 days to clear. Received no response for going on like 5 days. Post on Reddit and get a response. Sheesh.

It's not just my family. It's most iPhone/Apple users I run into. Co-workers, friends, girlfriends, family. This isn't an isolated thing. Apple has earned the stereotype of tech for non-techies for a reason. And it has it's merits. If I was a complete Luddite, I might want the Apple experience as well. It protects me from having to grow.
But, that's the problem. When average Apple people have a problem or issue it just kind of stops them and stumps them and, often, I think Apple does that by design because it forces people to come in to Apple for a revenue generating moment.
I hire creative freelancers and, in general, I don't love to hire ones that are only familiar with an Apple computing environment because they tend to have absolutely no ability to problem solve when things don't go just right both in computing, but also in real life. I tend to see a carry over. 
Maybe it's Apple, maybe it's the types of people that gravitate towards Apple and can tolerate an Apple experience. I don't know, I just know it's a thing.

I hate them as a solution for me because of how they control and micro manage my devices.
I hate having to interact with average Apple users because, due to the fact that Apple obscures how everything in their devices works, technologically illiterate people are allowed to stay that way rather than learning about their stuff, which is fine until they have an issue. I'm sort of a go to tech guy for the family and friends and yeah, I hate.
But this, this I love.

I think there's stuff like...I know tons of iPhone users that will say to me "oh that photo is on my iPhone 4s in this drawer." They have no clue how to "get it off of the device". That's a function of Apple making the technology superficially easy, but deep down obtuse because actually getting at your files is a fucking bitch. 
I personally can't stand Apple products because I don't want to deal with technology that works like that. It me its infuriating. It's infuriating that I can't switch a default app or drag and drop files onto my phone without iTunes. And so on and so on.
