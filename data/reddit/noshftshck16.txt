Hey thanks dick! Really appreciate the help! Not a person who uses this. Usenet forced my hand once almost 2 years ago. Never saved any of my bank info so riddle me that.

Yep, cause I used it for NZBMatrix VIP subscription. Which leads me to believe its a backlash from them...
Never shopped at Target before.

What is especially weird is none of my bank information is on the site...

I've actually looked through the account. None of my credit/debit/bank information was on file. I have no idea what is going on.
Stop getting on the offensive. I'm not bashing anything. It was simply a heads up. Jesus Christ.

Coinbase is a bitcoin wallet. I'm not trying to bash bitcoin. I just figured it would be a good place to post a heads up that there was fraudulent activity on it. My issue made a friend realize he had recieved several authentication requests on Coinbase despite not logging in.

If someone breaks into your house, is your only advice to them, "Should have installed a security system?"

That is all I know right now. I had used Coinbase once back on in May of 2012 for a Usenet subscribtion. Never heard of the 2FA or anything like that. I recieved no notification of a transaction until I checked my checking account this morning. 10 bitcoins were purchased.
