hah, sneaky!

Interesting, thank you for the clarification. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:28:56
Oh he did make it! Over here in Miami, hah!

Regulation was bound to happen, but still--- this is 1980's NYSE and 00's DOT com era all over again!
This is fantastic, but nothing new! 
We have tons of exchanges out there already. 
The article does not go into how they will have regulation except they'd be getting a "bit license." 
So what? Is that any real trust? 
What does it mean having to go through "licensing" or having a license? Does the state verify funds? Is there a bond held w/ the state?  
Is there insurance? Is it even insurable? 
All the article says is that by having a "bitlicense" they'll be able to have an USA bank account, instead of the offshore accounts everyone else uses. 
Other than that, the whole idea of having an API for integration to trading platforms does seem very exciting. 
So, only useful if you wish to daytrade bitcoin and want to buy on margin.

This is so huge, my friend and I can't stop discussing how this rollout makes Bitwage so highly likely to be bought out by an established payment processor like ADP.
BTW, fantastic Saturday presentation in Miami!!

Oh, how I wish Imgur didn't strip EXIF data...

Makes sense, on the Tokyo Metro they have a creation about who was the inventor of Bitcoin - Satoshi. 
It's the incar entertainment. I just picked up my katakana and could barely read the question but the answers were all in katakana.
Victory for me, and it's nice how in Japan it's becoming more legitimate and accepted. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 07:48:04
Was $720 4 hours ago. Wow. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:59:30
They also have ATMS, casino meetups for questionable transactions and meeetups for general get rich schemes. 
I miss Manila. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 02:20:30
No, let's not, that would baseline all the listings to bitcoin besides their local currency. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 03:36:39
I saw this too, holy fuck. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:03:28
Yeah, because bitcoin is private and not a public ledger /s.
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:29:34
Nope, even easier. Rusty wrench. Attack the human, make him happily hand over his wallet. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:37:00
This is good. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:35:32
What, no that's not what a future contract is. 
A future contract is on already existing bitcoin. 
That is so wrong. You should not reply on any other topic.

Philippines is 4 hours away. 
Macau is 3 hours away.
Hong Kong is 3 hours away. 
You are a fool if you think Japanese have no outlet. 
Now, if you say Japanese can't because of strict work, overtime and inability to survive outside the country due to language barrier - than yes. 
Though I've met a ton of Japanese in Cebu, Macau, HK that just love to have fun. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:36:32
Also wrong, when it matures you have the option of buying it.

I also read how money works from DK

I'm going to finally order a Bitcoin ATM. I hope it pays off. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:13:13
Let's go on a riiiiiide!
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:19:11
Same, bought in near at the top, 2600, and sold at 2400 before it tanked. 
Oh well, this is how we learn, right guys? 
Granted I did sell some when it hit 2200 that I bought a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:22:01
Yes you do, it's your billing address. They ask for it to counter fraud. 
Bitcoin is anonymous, Coinbase and any exchange can set any rule they please. They have to follow KYC, know your customer. 
Your post is the same as people who use bitcoin for illegitimate needs. 
Just make a wallet, go to localbitcoin, cash someone out. The market is tanking so people are wanting to meet and cash out asap. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:10:47
But, can't people just send btc to a wallet on korbit and cash out?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:57:31
You will when it's $1k!
Mt. Gox 2.0 here we come!
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:01:22
Woah, really? What happened? It was $230 2 weeks ago. Okay, fine 3 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:30:37
It's a great idea.
I don't know why I didn't think of it before. 
I should do something here, as I'm an expat in the Philippines, living near a red light district which is always populated by foreigners. 
It's amazing branding. Simple, elegant and people who get it are the type of people I want to socialize with. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:47:10
Easiest way to get free bitcoin, pay for marketing on google.
Genius! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:51:42
Holy shit, when did btc go to 25$? It was $13 a month or so ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:44:37
Holy.fucking.shit. 
So when is it going to crash to 3-4$ again?
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:39:09
It wasn't off, I used a different amount for the variable. I didn't know *how high* btc really went. You can check the variable I used by reversing the porportion:
          
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:55:39
Holy shit 55% gains. 30K investment, as of now you've made 16,5K gain. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:43:57
my god, man.
