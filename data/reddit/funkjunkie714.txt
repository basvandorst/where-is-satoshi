Any info is appreciated.  I mean who doesn't want to earn bitcoins?  You guys don't think this has any potential?  If not, why not?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:54:53
It sucks in the way I may be selling/sending out a bitcoin that cost me $100 with a difference/profit of $600 or a bitcoin that cost me $500 with a difference/profit of $200.  Idk I might want to keep my less costly bitcoin as it is worth more??? Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture yet o_O
Edit: price is for example sake

Damn, you did good. I understand being ultra paranoid.  I heard good reviews on that app so I went ahead gave it a try.  Im going to give that live cd ubuntu a try.  How do you install and make make it work off a CD?  Can u point me to  link that shows very easy instructions? Hehe

Coinbase Trader app for android is awesome, I woke up to this.  I had it set for .1 bitcoin at $950 and it got it for me at a better price at $903.10 with fees.  This is the 3rd time I have woken up to good buys with this app

Skip it foo! Please!

Yes you are right, it does.  I think its a win win here.  These groups will be exposed to bitcoins and seems they are growing very rapidly since it's only a measly $5 worth of bitcoin to join.  They are reffering these teams/groups to Coinbase and they get instructions to how go about get their account open and purchase some to join Neonymous.  
They are not very familiar with bitcoin, so my $5 went to an advertising spot and put a link to here.  So this community may get more exposure and more Bitcoin users if you will.  I made so we don't flood this community with Network Marketing Groups.

After viewing this video, it looked very positive to me.  What do you guys think?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:37:07
No I wasn't, but now that you brought it up.  Makes sense thanks
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:11:29
Awesome! Thanks! I'm going to give it a try.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:25:09
I agree.  I've been watching to much negativity from mainstream media :-/

What its Christmas so soon?  I'd like a gold thingy too :-D thanks in advance

Think? Just an example...with the volatility and all
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:07:03
No I'm not taking you for a ride...and your reply makes total sense.  Thank you!

Count me in...any in O.C.? I buy subway 5 days a week.

We all know Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme, why do you say Neonymous is?  It's a network marketing company selling advertising and you get paid commission in bitcoins...just like being paid with fiat.  right?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:34:19
That sucks, well noted
