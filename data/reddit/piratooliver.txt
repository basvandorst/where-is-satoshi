It appears your basic problem is that bitcoin fits perfectly into austrian/classical micro-economic theory; supply and demand of something useful to everyone goes quite a long in explaining the economics at work.  It's the very protection from meddling hands that makes it what it is.
BTC has no place in the competing keynsian/socialist memeplex that I can see. Of course that's where a theorist goes to work but even a "de-centralized" corporation is a means for production and that ain't bitcoin.  A "meta-currency" is more interesting since BTC encapsulates holders opinions on fiat currencies but it appears that fiat currencies do a lot of this to each other already.
Would be interesting to see what other gentlemen in red can come up with here.

it seems that if gox wants to bill itself as a leader it should act like one.  ffs they must know that 1/2 the bitcoin economy is tied to their average price.

Dear Social Scientists: The antidote for consumerism has arrived!
Really though, there are a few people that spend more when they feel richer.

if you are gonna stay around for a while then it doesn't matter.  its a small universe that have even heard of this and bitcoins are becoming a large universe.  good luck
