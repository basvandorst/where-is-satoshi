My customer service has been pretty poor. I've been trying to *deposit* funds and it's been a very difficult process.

I don't think we'll ever be "good now". There will forever be improvements to made. That's the beauty of having some of the smartest people in the world pushing Bitcoin forward.

Which countries have imposed this law?

...except the title should also say "and Deposits". I've been trying to make a deposit for over a week now and still nothing. It took me a while to realize that they have paused both withdraws *and* deposits.

Me too, but aren't there bound to be other issues? I don't think we're ever going to be in a place were we can say that we're "all good". That's part of the beauty of the developers who are pushing Bitcoin forward.

Are these questions really going to prevent laundering? Most of the answers are arbitrary/BS, and all I did to prove "*What is the source of the funds which you are depositing to your Bitstamp account?*" was send a copy of my pay stub from work. That doesn't prove that I'm not depositing funds I acquired from other sources.

What/whos law? I'm missing something here. I can invest in stocks without ever needing to give this info to the exchange.

Strange... it's not here for me:
