There are some people developing/promoting messaging and archiving services that use the distributed nature of the Bitcoin protocol to provide some very interesting new spins on Notary-style businesses. 
While this is an extremely minor usage of Bitcoin, it does demonstrate that it can theoretically be backed up by something that people do subjectively value. It's not just math for the sake of math.
Austrians have a very particular notion of how money comes to exist, so I think it might help if you can frame the argument in terms of uses of the Bitcoin protocol in these terms.

It's a bad thing only if you're a member of the elite who wants to make the rules that control society and enrich you and give you incredible influence and access.

Agreed, but I would recommend using terminology like "free market" and "voluntary exchange" when trying to initially talk to others.
The word capitalism is just so loaded because people use it whenever they're describing corporatism and corruption and other bad things.

Do you believe that Bitcoin's pricing is based on a random component like gambling is?

As a small positive, you learned an important life lesson about how many people in power are small-minded and petty.
I would recommend challenging your teacher on this and getting your parents involved if necessary.
