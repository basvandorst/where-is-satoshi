Sorry, I forgot to mention that my wallet is "watching only" now. And cause I sent my BTC straight from an exchange I didnt double check if my wallet (which I already sent BTC's to before) still works perfectly.

very nice to spread awareness. Thanks!

Could you maybe explain how the process looks like? Or maybe do you have a link to a tutorial?
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:37:34
If I open the wallet file its "watching only" and Seed under Wallet is grayed out.

Isnt there a difference between "master_private_keys" and "private keys"? In the file (wallet file) there isnt a element with the name "private key" only "master_private_key" (which is 172 chars/numbers long)

Yeah I should get that Password after some tries. Do you have a link how to decrypt it?

Hmmm strange. In my file the private master key starts with "kcp2". Does that mean this wallet contains no private keys?

Wow you are a fucking legend. Thank you so much - The wallet was somehow really corruptet and with the new wallet there are no problems anymore.

Do you maybe have any links to a tutorial how to do it? Thanks in advance!

My master private key starts with kcp2. Is it the old format or just a random irrelevant key?
