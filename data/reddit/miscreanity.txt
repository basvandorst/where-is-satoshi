Transmit beamforming. Fancy term for making use of constructive and destructive radio frequency transmissions.
The transmitting station listens to feedback from other stations (including clients) and performs analysis on those signals. Based on that analysis, the transmitter adjusts its waveform so that it propagates in a way that will create a spike in signal strength.
This is similar to MU-MIMO in WiFi hardware today but significantly advanced. Notably, it is capable of being completely decentralized although it requires high levels of processing power.

I've explored the frequent flyer miles route and found it to be a difficult system to crack. Amtrak is actually one of the latest participants, and there's a lot of back &amp; forth necessary to authorize transfer of miles. Using Bitcoin would be unlikely to provide benefit there yet, since convincing such large businesses just isn't in the cards right now.

So it seems that the risks are:
1. Use a system for ease-of-use, but rely on potentially sanctioned MITM entities and can cause widespread issues if compromised
2. Rely on a method that would require duplicated effort to attack each organization, but can make it harder to prevent localized compromises

It would be better to have a consensus or PoS chain interoperate with the Bitcoin blockchain... eventually. The question is how to get there from where we are today.

The issue is Bitcoin's scalability (transactions peer second, block chain size, etc), although the devs have been dwelling on the technical minutiae during discussions. At the moment, there is disagreement as to what the best way to proceed is, not whether additional services are good or not (everyone generally agrees that increased functionality is a positive thing).

As notes, the new code would be operationally disconnected when run. This is because it isn't the hashing power that determines the protocol in use - it's the nodes relaying transactions and blocks. If they don't agree with your code, your malformed communications are ignored (even mined blocks).
This also happens to be the main intangible benefit of running a full node, since they determine how the network operates. This is essentially the true voting power and arguably has more weight than mining operations. It could be far more devastating to have malicious nodes than hostile miners, although an attacker would need a substantial proportion of both hashing power and alternative nodes to truly harm Bitcoin.
Run as many geographically distributed Bitcoin nodes as you can!

The article also only takes into account a momentary perspective, not one of a dynamic environment. If Bitcoin becomes the monetary standard, credit cards will be a quaint memory.
It is not the credit card aficionados that will determine future direction, but the newer generations of youth whom are well aware of society's current failings. They are more likely to build anew than remain mired in legacy and chase after illusory factors.

As sandball stated the draft is very arrogant, almost as much as FATCA. Bitcoin is not like contemporary financial tech -- the oversight suggested is trying to cram crypto into a pen &amp; paper world.
Government is way behind as usual since auditing, security, and other features are already being demanded by participanting users. Regulators are simply playing catch-up.
This is a maturation process. When the environment has settled there will be de facto standard and the rules will be codified based on that. In the meantime all the arm waving histrionics are a sideshow.

Ripple still relies on gateways. Bitshares and Counterparty require asset issuers. Those are all trusted, centralized parties.
Until everything can be done entirely within a crypto environment, there will be translation services needed. Since decentralized approaches are unreliable (Local Bitcoins, web of trust, etc), a focal business with established long-term presence in the Bitcoin world is currently the best option in my opinion.

Happy cake day!
Let's say you have 1 bitcoin and you lock it to USD - Coinapult exchanges your bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, less 1% so about $360. The same can be done for any other asset they offer access to, such as gold. Coinapult is effectively a custodian for your asset.
Yes, this is the same as doing the exchange yourself on Bitstamp or elsewhere. However, plenty of people don't have the inclination to learn about currency trading and just want savings without the volatility, or access to some form of banking where there are no other options.

The ratio of effort in construction to destruction is heavily weighted against fiber. It is far easier to cut a cable than repair or redeploy, especially for nonprofessionals. It is also anything but mobile.
Millions of low and self or wirelessly-powered transceivers with sufficient deployment density can route around any disruption as really as water flowing past a rock.
As for regulatory impediments, just look at cognitive and software-defined radio. Government cannot stop anything, only slow it down. Any outright block is met with loss of technological edge and eventual backlash domestically. Small cells are another step toward a completely decentralized environment in which the very organizations pushing them are likely to be superseded.

Book author does not understand Bitcoin as a system; the components taken separately do no add up to something greater. Removing the unit of account demotes Bitcoin to a trust ranking network that would be as fragile as existing solutions.

The killer app likely has nothing to do with consumers. Bitcoin addresses systemic issues that most people are never exposed to in the first place, regardless of payment method.
What matters most is what merchants and producers accept, since they determine which medium can be used for exchange. If businesses refuse Argentine Pesos or US dollars or bitcoins while accepting something else, that's the factor which enables usage. Resistance may occur, but eventually consumers must embrace what the producers demand.

Maybe lack of imagination would be a better description. You're right, Bitcoin doesn't fix how things are done now - it changes the model entirely.

Long-term, off-chain transactions push on-chain transaction costs up in the absence of block reward subsidies.

Correct, PoS does not change externalities, so it doesn't fix anything there. At the same time hoarding perpetuates the problem, failing to fix the same issue.


It's a simple issue of stock vs. flow. If a person cannot save, he cannot benefit from PoS.


PoS: No redistribution. Everyone gets 1% more, and everyone loses 1% because of value loss (due to the fact that everyone gains 1%. It's called inflation).
If I earn 10,000 units of a PoS currency per year and must spend 5,000 for basic expenses (rent, food, transportation, etc) but you earn 5,000 and have to expend the same to live, you will not benefit from PoS while I would. It is redistribution to the haves, so the same as the current fiat system.


The inflation has an end point.

I'm sure ideas are being discussed behind closed doors in government if they haven't been already. It would offer a path out of a very difficult situation and if Bitcoin were to be the heralded crypto, unprecedented levels of control and tracking could be implemented over time. Even Satoshi started there are numerous attacks possible.
Blockchain weaponization is another potential to take into consideration. The SWIFT network is controlled by western nations, so China and Russia are creating an equivalent. Bitcoin could be promoted as a non-partisan solution for all and, if accepted and joined by all major nations, a kind of arms race may develop for dominance of the system.
There are simply too many factors which make crypto appealing for governments and institutional scale organizations to let it be. I think the chances of this are higher than we suspect.

The approach taken is most similar to Mastercoin, but development is completely open source and there's no mandated payment to developers. It is entirely community-driven.

Less and less. Long distance, low-latency is where fiber and other high-capacity connections shine. Wireless meshes can certainly span the globe, including transoceanic propagation (albeit at very low bandwidth).
The more nodes exist within a mesh, the greater the aggregate bandwidth. With the right routing and caching algorithms, they can provide better capacity than wired ones. With the added ability to drown and flow around interruptions they become a win by default.

I get the impression that you are not entirely familiar with Bitcoin's growth model. Please review the [brief explanation]( and the [controlled supply section]( at the FAQ site. To sum it up, there will only ever be 21 million full bitcoins and they are generated with decreasing frequency (from 50 every 10 minutes to 25 currently, and halving every 210,000 blocks or ~4 years); unit inflation will be below 2% by 2020.


Governments can prolong periods of *perceived* stability by countering cycles, during which undercurrents either erode systemic stability and result in progressively greater failures or cause disruptions in connected economies. These are non-linear systems and capital flows do not obey government.

Investors and savers would certainly accumulate a decent amount, but anyone just dabbling is arguably unlikely to jump in with more than 0.15 to start at current exchange rates -- an impulse-buy range of perhaps $20-100 for a family or low wage earner. Rising attention seemed to trigger around the $100-200 price level in 2013, so a disposable amount for many working individuals without a deep understanding of Bitcoin may have been 0.5-1BTC then.
I think it might show successive waves of non-technical users testing the waters since late last year, possibly showing adoption growth more clearly. Similar distribution exists with traditional bank accounts where the lowest balances typically have the highest velocity of money coming in and going out.

Likewise, its good to hash out details, even if we may have hijacked the post a bit.
Yes, bitGold maintains a floating relationship to bitshares in the *equivalent* value of gold. When a contract is unwound the *equivalent* value of the underlying asset is obtained. I think we keep missing each other on the equivalence aspect, wherein a CFD is great for trading the *value* but not the *ownership* of the underlying instrument. For instance, I would not be able to acquire a controlling stake in a company with CFDs on its stock.
If I'm not mistaken, bitGold *could* be called on to deliver the real asset. If so, it's still an IOU even if it is never closed out in that manner and exists atop a genuine digital asset. I'm uncertain as to the extent of deliverability from Coinapult regarding alternative assets such as gold.
I should clarify that I am not suggesting Coinapult is helping to stabilize Bitcoin, just the perceived storage value. Bitcoin itself will still fluctuate, perhaps wildly.
As for the legalities, almost every ToS I've seen has similar disclaimers. If that were the determining factor for success, I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoinica and Gox were still riding high and BTC-e defunct. Running a business has become a terrifying proposition in many locations, and frivolous attacks on legitimate ones are becoming harder to defend against. Having protective documentation upfront is an absolute necessity, and reputation is still king.
That said, the transition to crypto makes it much more difficult for both businesses and their clients to breach agreements. It would certainly be better to remain entirely in the crypto environment but that isn't realistic for much of the world just yet. I think Coinapult's service can easily serve as a springboard toward that.

The position is a good one, but I disagree to an extent. Anything is corruptible at any point during its development, and there is no need to create a government-specific cryptocurrency when maintaining a single pool (Bitcoin) simplifies all manner of centralized operations.
Further, if Bitcoin acts as a honeypot of sorts, a system like Ripple (or the equivalent in Bitcoin) introduces focal control points. No anonymizing system can account for all side channels, especially when they may be situated at a deeper level than the protocol. All hardware is susceptible to some degree.
In effect, there is no earthly manner of escape. There is only the fight. Please continue struggling against the odds, since we're lost otherwise. I hope Monero or another system offers some semblance of freedom.

Carriers are currently introducing small cell technologies which integrate cellular, Wi-Fi and powerline broadband. Qualcomm in particular has been pushing IEEE 1905.1 which integrates numerous standards and make handing off from one connection type to another seamless.
LTE-U introduces unlicensed 4G cellular networks. Wi-Fi in whitespace spectrum increases range for consumer-level wireless routers.
Open hardware is becoming more prevalent. The likelihood is that the above networking standards will be highly supported.
Cable companies are terrified of the telcos, and telcos are afraid of community network propagation. Rightly so.
The more any attempt is made to clamp down technologically, the more those same technologies will be used to subvert central control. In less than a decade, Internet connectivity in most populated regions will probably be as freely accessible as breathable air.

It's meant to show the general transition of wealth from fiat to crypto (in this case Bitcoin). The presentation could definitely be improved with calculation of funds moving out of Bitcoin as well, since it would show the margins.
If $1000 worth of funds move into Bitcoin in a 24 hour period and $800 move out, the net gain is $200. This enables estimation of whether new coin generation will be too fast (price drops), too slow (price roses), or about right to maintain exchange value. It can also enable a better picture of larger trends.
Right now the visualization is neat, but really only half of a useful tool. The potential utility is subtle but very significant.

A handful of days points do not make a trend. As soon as buy-and-hold accumulators have picked up substantial amounts and decide to sit on their holdings, the distributive pattern reverses and concentration gradually builds.
The original holders disbursing their share indicates some combination of three things:
1. Altruistic intention to build interest in the system
2. Movement to secondary wallets
3. Profit-taking
None of those points prevent the structural trend of asset accumulation. It's debatable whether PoS can prevent that.
At this point, Ripple would survive without the backing company just as Bitcoin or Nxt would without their core dev teams. Distribution remains the real problem there.
eMunie has an open-ended, inflationary unit supply and runs into its own set of issues. The developers are independent -- no company. The best source of info is at emunie.com which has links to more detailed pages.
Overall, I find that Bitcoin still offers the best structure. We'll have to see more limitations before that changes.

Sidechains can have sidechains of their own, creating a hierarchy. This can also expand the initial chain. A thought experiment as I understand things:
* A sidechain (SC) is created with the backing of 10BTC
* Value of the SC grows beyond 10BTC
* A SC is created from the initial SC, expanding availability (stock split) - this chain can be attached to both the initial SC and Bitcoin
* If the value in a SC is to be removed and returned to Bitcoin, it may need to be done in one comprehensive operation (stock buyback)
The value moved back into Bitcoin would eventually increase the overall value of the entire system. What's important to note is that floating market rates may be maintained through expansion of chain quantity rather than value.

Once buried, fiber is very difficult to find. Repeaters are not so difficult to locate. Finding just one can uncover an entire network.
There's also the difficulty of laying extended lengths of fiber without being detected when surveillance is pervasive and increasing.
Any failure of a fiber network can be catastrophic whereas no failures in a wireless network are.
For a small region, fiber may work well in an undetected manner. There's a threshold where wireless is by far a better option when privacy and reliability of data transmission are concerned - hiding in plain sight.

To me it seems that any variation in value would simply be shuffled around, essentially redistributing throughout the Bitcoin/sidechain network. Note that maaku states cross-chain transactions are atomic and therefore cost nothing while being as instantaneous as propagation allows.
If a 1BTC sidechain grows in value by 2x, that would mean that a second BTC would have been transferred into it. The wealth already in the sidechain does not have to exchange hands, but the demand for it can vary.
Thinking of corporate bond offerings may help in conceptualizing the flow patterns. The end result is that Bitcoin being at the core of this system means that it is the end recipient of all inflows -- usage of sidechains serves to grow Bitcoin.

National currencies will still exist for some time, but polarized competition offers the opportunity to gain an upper hand in a blockchain system. Whether PoW, PoS or consensus, each can be gamed at the institutional level. If such a system is used as a global clearinghouse instead of the traditional banking system, there is the potential for economic warfare to achieve an all-or-nothing level.
Currently, international financial systems enable commerce across borders and each nation can institute its own system if so desired. The US dollar as reserve has shown very well the devastating power to be thrown about through financial system control via ACH, SWIFT and various other mechanisms.
Gold as a reserve may be a stopgap solution but with China and Russia accumulating in preparation for dollar demise, the US and others may reject such a system. This could make gold of limited international use, particularly with difficulties in auditing and accountability. That leaves a blockchain system as the only universally verifiable method that cannot be falsified.
Bitcoin essentially becomes weaponized and acts as a mutually-assured-destruction failsafe so long as neither of the opposing sides can unquestionably overwhelm the other. If one can, the stakes would be virtually winner-takes-all as the controlling interest shuts down the other side. A blockchain fork would be an emergency akin to nuclear attack.

No negative interest rates (talk to people from Europe). A bitcoin this year is a bitcoin next year, not 0.98 bitcoin. Volatility notwithstanding, which is a self-correcting issue over time as the system grows.
The trust is not much of an issue with entities that have an incentive to maintain that trust. Rather, it is governing bodies that have fallen too far from trustworthiness that supersede financial counterparties. Trusted third parties do not have final say in making the rules.
The market for Bitcoin is not so much people whom have lived without awareness of virtual forms of exchange, but the generations that have grown up in the midst of rising financial turmoil - those born after the 1980s. They are more likely to not be complacent.
Most of Bitcoin's superior functionality will not be evident for some time yet, and by then it will probably be commandeered for detrimental purposes.

BitTorrent belongs in the data center. In a not-too-distant future that may change, but for now that is the best place. Combine that with subscription caching service (accelerated media delivery) paid for using Bitcoin micropayments (relatively micro), and the major ISPs (cable, DSL, fiber, etc) won't be able to complain anymore without looking like the bad guys (even more than they do now). Those payments may also occur in transit and peering arrangements between providers, not just from end users.
Essentially, there are no dumb pipes anymore - they must become smart to handle rising bandwidth demands. The most effective way to do that is not by working with the traditional payment systems.

Dense deployments of LTE/WiFi small cells are capable of increasing bandwidth by at least an order of magnitude, approaching fiber speeds at a fraction of the cost. The key is density which results in numerous routes, much like SCSI scatter/gather or a BitTorrent stream.

Quite accurate regarding hidden costs (I'd use the term "masked"), although the adoption requirement is somewhat misleading. Consumer adoption is not as important as B2B in growing usage of Bitcoin.

Velocity alone does not offer a good picture. The system within which the velocity exists is more important, as is the rate of change in velocity.
Simply put: Bitcoin is a growing environment, fiat is a decaying one. Change of velocity in the former indicates progressive waves of savings or usage so long as fundamental systemic structure remains intact. Since that structure is failing with fiat, the velocity changes there suggest decreasing usage and divestment.
Spiking velocity in fiat could show attempts to get rid of it. The same with Bitcoin means usage increase. Valuation will move in step for fiat (decreasing volatility with decreasing value), but with Bitcoin there are varying pools of asset types that can occur (meta systems like Coloured Coins and Counterparty, sidechains, traditional off-chain services, etc). Velocity doesn't have as direct a relation in that situation despite infrastructure being directly tied to Bitcoin.

There are consequences as well: unprecedented tracking means even more control for authorities. Additionally, Bitcoin has the potential to become weaponized in a sense, similar to sanctions and exclusion from the SWIFT network. That's essentially global in reach, but Bitcoin may become globally pervasive due to the ease of participation - no banks to get approved by before gaining the ability to conduct transactions.

Condescension begets the same. Asking why someone thinks a certain way is much more productive. Typing on a mobile device isn't conducive to lengthy posts either.
It does take a bit of imagination to get from A to B, and a lot more work to make it actually happen. The trend is clear, though - existing security models place a great deal of effort in areas which have decreasing effectiveness. A reassessment is necessary, and that's where Bitcoin comes into the picture.
Here's why I think Bitcoin is entirely relevant:
Generating and maintaining private/public key pairs is what hinders widespread usage of crypto (as in user usage beyond banking and secure web sessions). The options to sign and encrypt documents and emails are present in many business applications, but using them may as well require a doctorate for most people.
Bitcoin infrastructure is developed to a point where that key management aspect is almost entirely invisible to users. Synchronized keys among user devices could be used, simplifying the process further (the Mitro password manager is headed in the right direction, and some of that functionality appears to be present in the Airbitz wallet). When securing documents is that simple for users it can become the default, making a breach that exposes such documents a relative non-issue.
While the above can be done without Bitcoin, there is little incentive for users to become familiar with the technology unless forced to by policy. If they have reason to learn on their own, the procedural knowledge is more common, easier to integrate and much more likely to be adhered to without much resistance (and less human error to boot).

Fees are many banks' lifeline and can only be reduced a small amount before flow of funds goes negative. It is very unlikely that banks can lower fees enough to complete with Bitcoin without major disruption and a large wave of failures.

Frivolous investment does not require inflation. Monetary inflation degrades value universally, while a static supply raises all participants over time.
The same jockeying occurs in either system. What distinguishes is the scarcity and desperation motive in inflation versus abundance with a static unit.
It is not money that creates or determines value, but the product or service. An inflating money supply thoroughly distorts that by increasing emphasis on money over all else, introducing instability and uncertainty for an aspect of life that could otherwise be a transparent matter for most people.
It used to be simple: work hard and save. Now a graduate degree is required to deal with monetary issues thanks to monetary inflation creating a moving target.
If entire classes of bugs could be removed from software through a simple change in methods, wouldn't it be worthwhile? The same applies to the monetary system - entire categories of issues present with the inflationary model would not exist with a static supply. Bitcoin as a technology makes it possible.

It would work for any type of trading. As you point out, it wouldn't be well suited for the use case of the winning trade withdrawing immediately, but the exchange could conceivably front the funds knowing that they're retrievable via multisig. Both traders would have multisig deposits in any case.
Is important to keep in mind that exchanges have internal order books that are off-chain. This multisig deposit backing method would increase auditing complexity, but potentially increase verifiability of crypto assets while ensuring depositor fund security to a much greater degree than currently exists.

The Ripple distributed exchange is a great tool, the XRP units have some issues in implementation, and the Ripple company had made poor operational choices.
I think it would be fantastic to see the DeX work with bitcoins as the units, although that might be technically insurmountable. Personally, I find the XRP implementation very interesting as it is a sort of Proof-of-Burn approach, enabling the consensus model Ripple is built upon. If Bitcoin were to shift away from PoW in the future, I think this would be the top candidate over Proof-of-Stake.
As far as the company, there were several other ways that could've been pursued to distribute ripples; [Counterparty's]( initial burn was as close to ideal as system inception gets today. The development process definitely could have been more transparent, and retaining control of an enormous chunk of total assets is not the way to engender trust.

I agree, and bitGold is not actually gold, so it is an IOU as well. If it relies on an underlying asset for value or even valuation, it is not an asset - it is a claim on an asset. If it tracks the price of an index or fund, it is an even further removed derivative - an IOU for an IOU.
You can't get around the counterparty issue for anything other than purely digital assets whether it involves an individual, a company or a blockchain. Digital assets would be Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripples, etc - not what they might represent.
The entire purpose of Coinapult as I see it is not the division between real and digital asset ownership. It is an effort that aims to simplify and introduce relative stability to Bitcoin via a single reputation point. Companies rise and fall based on their reputation, so it doesn't matter whether it's an American, Chinese or Panamanian company if it does right by its clients.

@_date: 2014-11-27 02:07:23


Must it?
A static supply works just fine until practical limits are reached and/or counterparty issues arise.
With physical forms of money both of those problems eventually take hold. Currencies in digital form (USD, EUR, etc) have no physical limitations, but the counterparty concern becomes paramount. All of these are risks internal to the monetary systems they're part of.
With well-designed cryptocurrencies (esp. Bitcoin), the threats are almost entirely external as opposed to internal. Mining majority, full node majority, cryptographic compromise, etc.
Practical limits don't exist for Bitcoin the way they do other systems, and the barriers to entry and participation are marginal (regarding usage, not initial acquisition of units through exchange for contemporary money). The counterparty concern is also nearly eliminated in the sense that nothing can forcibly change ownership of assets held in the system (no frozen accounts or physically seized assets).
Unit issuance, clearing, transmission and so on are all handled with no government or other institutional handler. This does result in a more volatile and seemingly chaotic period of growth, but it is no different from any number of startups or other technologies that eventually became established.
We're so accustomed to the decimal point moving in one direction that it's become very difficult to wrap our heads around the possibility of it moving opposite.
Contemporary (increasing money supply)
Bitcoin (increasing divisibility)
You could say that this is deflation, but shrinking the total existing supply of traditional currencies is in reality impractical, if not impossible. Bitcoin has the potential to eliminate entire classes of issues that occur with current currencies.
There's plenty of room in Bitcoin for much more value in relation to real assets. Increasing the precision for another 8 decimal places provides orders of magnitude greater supply without causing the kind of disruption money supply inflation produces.


If ineffective policy is the issue, and government determines policy, how can the argument for government control be a consistent argument?
Any trader can make money when everything is rising as in a growing economy; likewise, any government can make one blunder after another in the same environment. It's when the system matures and cruft can no longer be supported as readily that the aging structure most needs appropriate policy, which is exactly when ineffective and detrimental ones are enacted. Why should thousands of years of governing bodies repeating the same mistakes be ignored this time? It's insanity.
Deregulation often occurs at the worst time, generally when the regulatory environment has created perverse incentives. Regulatory capture plays a major part in this, so the economic factor alone does not explain the entire situation. That's the GFC in a nutshell.
A dynamic system that is non-linear cannot be managed from the myopic viewpoint of politicians: the system must manage itself. That can't happen with traditional models which depend upon direct human intervention.


If that were the case, why didn't eGold or Ven or Linden Dollars or WoW gold become greater forces? Take away the decentralised aspect and Bitcoin would be a non-starter; anything less would revert to the status-quo financial system.
I think the greater danger is that governments will manage to utilize crypto for facilitation of even greater tracking and control than has ever been possible in history, creating an inescapable beast.

It's more like [SpiderOak]( -- information is encrypted client-side, then stored on distributed servers. There's also the ability to send messages directly, although there are (were?) [serious issues]( which I assume you're referring to.
Initially, I'd discounted Telegram for the same concerns you cite. However, ChatSecure sadly isn't as popular (yet). From my experience, CS can also be cumbersome with multiple devices.
Messaging apps by themselves are fine, and Bitcoin wallets by themselves are as well. Combined functionality offers increased utility while helping to increase both awareness and adoption. If CS *reliably* offered that (Gliph) and smooth multi-device coordination (Telegram), then it'd be a no-brainer.
I'm looking at this not so much as being about the most secure way of messaging and more about getting people headed in the right direction, even if it's only a little better than before. You may be right in avoiding Telegram entirely, though. Perhaps crowdsourcing of features for ChatSecure is the way to go (working with Blockchain or Mycelium)?
Edit: [Jitsi]( would be a great candidate as well.

Bitcoin units are divisible to 8 decimal points. That's 2.1 quadrillion:
A fork could move that expansion further out. The decimal can move further to the right without destroying the system, unlike an inflationary model. By using a solid foundation, entire classes of economic problems are prevented.

That's great for a party that wants to take on risk in that manner, but it isn't what Coinapult is doing.

This continues to assume adoption must push from the consumer side. While that helps for awareness, it is not likely. Linux (and BSD) made inroads on the back end, not the desktop. It now serves as the platform for the vast majority of consumer handheld devices.
I believe Bitcoin (and/or complementary systems) is more likely to bridge the gap between nation polarizations, enabling capital flows among Russia and Europe and China and the US. Gold is being positioned as the tool to accomplish this, but will probably be abandoned due to accounting ambiguity and international dispute, leaving a blockchain system as the only practical successor.

Implementing 3-of-4/5 multisig on trading deposits could help with this sort of risk. If 3/5, one key is held by an arbitrator that can be optionally used to release funds. Otherwise, the custodian and client can consent among themselves.
The deposit would act as a reserve for the exchange's order book rather than being managed directly by the exchange.

That's a good concept, very similar to the GreenAddress.it service.
A multisig deposit at an exchange would not have every trade pushed to the blockchain. Trades would remain on the exchange's internal order book and be settled periodically on the block chain, probably enforcing trader compliance by disabling that user's activity until signing a settlement transfer or enlisting the third party arbitrator.
I think most people would prefer that approach than to explicitly trust an exchange with funds.

Nodes can "map" the Bitcoin network to find dense propagation clusters, then maintain connections to those key network points. Each node can do this independently, although commercial solutions would still be able to offer greater connectivity and monitoring; the difference is scale.

I don't think that's the extent of it. Small cells have shown supportive capacity but not enough to truly alleviate bandwidth demand. A completely different way of handling RF is making progress - transmit beamforming. It is a technique in which constructive interference is intentionally created in order to form a signal spike in a very small local region, as small as centimeter scale.
[Artemis Network's pCell]( is one such system, although it requires significant processing power and is a centrally managed variant. With ASICs, the technique could conceivably be decentralized.

There is no such thing as sufficiently anonymous - there is anonymity or identity; no in-between. It can be more difficult to identify the source with pseudonymity, but with enough time and/or monitoring capacity it becomes apparent.
Fungibility only remains intact within the system. In isolation there is no way to break that. When exposed externally (point of sale, exchange, etc), information leaks.
Although the task would be significant, it has been shown to be worth pursuing by governing entities. Government-approved transaction readers could be required that push detection and monitoring to the edges.
There are ways to ensure anonymity within Bitcoin, but they are not technically simple to implement presently or require transferring across blockchains. In the latter case, while possible,  there is not necessarily enough assurance of security or proper implementation.

Bitcoin is nowhere near big enough to handle settlement-scale capital movement. It's currently a bucket being asked to hold the volume of an Olympic swimming pool.
Adoption also requires usability. If the improvement is no better than a bank wire transfer it doesn't matter that the network is decentralized - the superficial behavior being the same means there's a barrier to switching.
In light of this I've lost almost all respect for the "core" devs.

Currently, yes. The same could be said of seatbelts and the iPhone before tech was developed to support their usage. Money storage and transfer is one use for Bitcoin, but it is the potential uses that are emerging which existing solutions can't easily adapt to.
Imagine a Russian bank facilitating rapid authentication and contract execution with one in France. Not likely to happen so readily without numerous manual checks and verifications on either side. Now add transactional communication between computers that require near-instantaneous responses and you'll see how the existing systems will be forced to change the way they operate, regardless of how effective they are at present.

Neither are strictly any safer than the other. It's the way they're implemented that matters. Numerous changes are being pushed by the current soft fork proposal, while only one change is in the hard fork method.

A soft fork can introduce unmanageable complexity. A simple hard fork to 2MB is the simplest and safest way to provide time for growth while other methods are explored (it's a handful of lines changed, mostly version updating).
Either way, this will resolve and the network will continue. Bitcoin Core is more likely to become overly burdened while alternative nodes continue functioning smoothly. Node operators and miners will transition as they see fit - there will be no binary failure of the system.

Printing money is not the only mechanism that facilitates control and fraud. Bitcoin as core in conjunction with a system like Ripple (the permissioned/permissionless dichotomy) offers far greater power over capital flows than the the traditional banking system.
It's only a matter of time before Bitcoin is understood and embraced by governments. The process is already well underway and accelerating.
Much of the transition involves political dreams of enforcing compliance without fallible human elements. A world where machines and robots do the work of those in control, and that requires a system which looks a lot like Bitcoin.
The current system is messy and fairly unaccountable. Bitcoin will be fought against here and there, but ultimately it will be harnessed and used as a tool to increase the power of those already in powerful positions. The threshold for turning things around may have already been exceeded.

Click on *[Security Center]( and you'll see a *Security Systems* section. There are two options there: *YubiKeys* and *Software Authenticators* - select *Add New* under *Software Authenticators*.
In the *Auth Name* field, you can choose whatever you want; enter *Google Authenticator* for now if you want to keep it simple.. You can either use your device to scan the QR code presented, or enter the information manually. If you use the QR code, everything will be set up automatically.
If going the manual route, enter the *Secure Private Key* into your Google Authenticator's *Key* field. The *Account* field doesn't matter, but it would help to make it something that you can recognize, such as *Mt. Gox*.
Once the information has been entered, Google Authenticator should automatically start generating the one-time keys. Enter the relevant 6-digit key into the Mt. Gox *Authenticator Code* field and click Save.
Now you will have a selection listed under *Software Authenticators*. Select which action you want to protect from one of the options above that field: *Log In*, *Withdrawal*, or *Security Center*. I recommend testing using *Withdrawal* only to get the hang of it, then including all of them.

There's been a surge in GPU based mining rigs being sold. This suggests that miners are offloading these older generation machines in anticipation of ASIC systems, or at the very least in favor of FPGA hardware.

The difference is that credit can unravel due to defaults, shrinking available credit. Bitcoin units don't contract - a bitcoin will always be a bitcoin. The same applies to real assets.
If Alice's reputation is not sufficient for Bob to extend her credit, she can still offer a non-credit asset for exchange. The latter is always available; credit is not guaranteed.
Saving in credit is a highly risky activity due to the dynamic nature. Immutable assets preserve value, which is where Bitcoin shines.

Not really.
Even if the developers somehow unanimously decided to increase the block reward from 50 to 100, it would be apparent almost immediately during testing or through source code perusal by perhaps hundreds around the world. Assuming it got past that point and were to be released from the official source, the change would be quickly noticed in the wild.The effect it would eventually have in the Bitcoin economy is almost certain to cause major disruption, probably to a point of crashing the entire experiment.
For those with a vested interest in Bitcoin's longevity, this would be unacceptable.
Removing the block size limit is an entirely different proposition, and one that can easily be seen as a sensible progression once scalability concerns have been allayed. Thankfully, most of the development and hashing power seems to be in competent hands.

For a new business, there's a very difficult line to tread - submit and be assimilated by the system, or survive by playing the game.

If the AML/KYC rules were a measure of validity for a service, there would be only a handful passing the test. For advanced usage, I agree that these services are important and losing anonymity is uncomfortable at best. However, without the gateways for transition *to* Bitcoin, we're all worse off.

FRB in combination with derivative instruments makes M0 highly misleading. With non-monetary assets being monetized and treated as capital, the amount of upward pressure on M0 results in an inaccurate representation of capital in relation to real economy perception.
While FRB can be done with Bitcoin, the extent of its impact will take time to build - perhaps years. It would provide some cushion for any price shocks, but it'd still be very thin by comparison with traditional finance. Meanwhile, the traditional fiat system may not have that long to close the gap between M0 and real economy expectations.

If the dominant numeraire remains fiat, then regulation is an overall detriment. This appears to be Jon's concern, which is understandable.

If Bitcoin were to continue with a block reward of 50 BTC per block for another 4 years, the 21mm unit limit would be reached after a total of 8 years. Instead, the block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, such that it will take decades to approach the asymptote.
Likewise, the explosive early-stage growth that Pirate had for the past 8 months is being reigned in - the 7% returns are already slowing somewhat, and will slow further in the future as Bitcoin's base unit supply growth declines.
It is impossible to hide flows *within* the Bitcoin system, so there is no way to maintain Ponzi activity like most are expecting Pirate's operation to be without dumping everything for a different asset. And as suggested earlier, guiding Bitcoin to become a truly global and widely used system would have a payoff several orders of magnitude greater than committing fraud anytime in the near future.

Bitcoin may be functionally similar to other monetary instruments, but the underlying structure is radically different. The system is completely transparent.
If you think it's a Ponzi, you don't understand it yet. This is understandable, as Bitcoin is a unique combination of various esoteric technologies which themselves are difficult for most to readily fathom.
Inflows are continuing because Bitcoin is proving itself as a viable platform while the traditional monetary system is being exposed as corrupt and fraudulent. This is resulting in an incentive to move from the fiat-based environment into alternatives, including gold and silver. Bitcoin is small enough that virtually *any* flows from other pools of wealth will drive its exchange rate up very easily.

It's a double-edged sword. Yes, it helps support a society under threat of financial collapse by providing an alternative monetary structure. On the other side, Bitcoin reduces the influence a government has over its citizenry, either by putting wealth out of reach, or by increasing the difficulty of monitoring transactions for taxation purposes.
Sanctions hurt the population more than a government, as there are other channels reserved by institutions for acquisition of resources (e.g. oil for gold). These options are generally unavailable to citizens.

Some of the move may be explained by time-based contracts, such as futures and options. As the derivative markets have matured, their effects on the Bitcoin exchange rate are becoming more pronounced.
Consider a contract due to expire at the end of the month - the holder of such a contract might profit if the BTC rate is below a threshold. There would then be incentive to force the price lower in time to pass the expiration in profit.
This is basically similar to what's been happening with gold and silver, as well as many commodities and other asset classes. The difference with Bitcoin is that there is an unambiguously quantifiable supply. That makes it much more difficult for derivatives to obscure the underlying instrument, whereas many questions surround who holds what amount of gold or whether it even exists in the first place.
One purely speculative possibility is that some powerful institution or organization has managed to obtain a large supply of bitcoins and is now using them to induce panic selling. If that drives enough holders to sell their coins, a concentration of assets would mean that pricing effectively becomes controlled by that entity - it wouldn't require that many bitcoins to massage the price levels, as price discovery occurs at the margins.
Other factors might include miners getting everything they can out of their hardware before the reward halving, returned GLBSE funds being sold off, or any number of other reasons. If the bitcoins being held in savings were to begin moving in size, that could have a disruptive effect on exchange rates as well - it could be like emptying a swimming pool with a fire hose instead of a drinking straw.

The idea is not so much to keep the operator of the exchange anonymous as it is to maintain client privacy. Currently, Tor can be used to access certain existing exchanges, but not all within Tor. By remaining within the Tor network, no exit nodes are used and tracking becomes virtually impossible.
Offering a hidden service then means that the client's potential compromise is greatly reduced in the digital realm, with the only remaining exposure *maybe* being on camera at a bank branch; making a deposit to an account at a bank remains anonymous.
@_date: 2012-08-16 04:12:41
Until 'lost' or dormant coins become active, they don't have a direct impact on the present availability. Only the moment of transaction determines pricing, regardless of the existing stock.
Example: assume I have a 10,000 liter supply of drinking water, but can only drink 1 liter per day. Realistically, I will not buy a 27+ year supply of drinking water. A 1 or 2 year supply might be reasonable depending on storage space. Therefore, I will not bid on the entire supply, just what I can make use of.
If only 10% of the 10,000 liter supply is for sale, a single buyer looking for a year's supply would determine the price. However, if there are *three* buyers vying for that same 2.7 year supply (at 1 liter/day), the price will be bid up. The remaining 9,000 liters don't matter at all in this situation - it's as if they don't exist.
Measures of market capitalization don't need to take stock into account, only the flow at the margin where price discovery occurs. The current valuation of bitcoins is based on the supply available for trade *right now*. If any of the stock were to be made available, it would be traded at *current* prices. Depending on how much comes into the market, the price may be affected, but that doesn't change the capitalization value beforehand.

The link was an example, not the final word. Zeus has been used as a base to build much more complex software. There have been aspects of Stuxnet modified for application to financial malware; obviously not the industrial control elements. This introduces that sophistication to financial software.
Just because Zeus primarily targets end users doesn't mean there is no software which is geared for banks.
Yes, there is an overlap in potential compromise of Bitcoin wallets as there is with traditional banking attacks from the client side, or any other form of custodial financial access. I suggested that Bitcoin *protects* against the kind of attack seen with banks, not that it is a guarantee of safety.
There is no counterparty risk in storing bitcoins offline, whereas with a bank you *must* be online to access your funds via computer. As linked in the OP, a brainwallet can be used for cold storage which is wholly inaccessible through any malware means. If you want to get absurdly technical again, it *is* possible to be compromised if making use of brainwallet information online or with an infected machine.
Again - calm down. The point of the post is that the banking system is failing, and the official line is a sick joke which can be largely avoided by using Bitcoin.

From the first price data available from [bitcoin charts]( the average exchange rate growth has been over 6.8% *per week*. Starting from $0.07 to today's rise above $13, the price is undervalued on a *historical growth basis* by as much as $60 per bitcoin. Without the 2011 bubble that amplified volatility, the price might have been closer to that level.
While there's no way of knowing precisely how strong the fundamental support is at this point, it does seem substantial. General [blockchain activity]( (~$66mm/month) is double that of the [online exchanges]( (~$30mm/month combined) and [Silk Road]( (~$2mm/month) combined, so it appears half of the Bitcoin economy is being found useful somehow in a non-visible manner.
@_date: 2012-08-04 06:39:04
That argument is valid as a thought experiment, but doesn't apply well to real world circumstances.
How much will Bitcoin increase in value in one day? Would you prefer to go a day without eating? Two days? If not, you'll spend your BTC to get food no matter how much the value rises.
In its early stages, Bitcoin will gain value rapidly. As the system matures, that rise in value will approximately match the amount of goods and services it represents. If the mature Bitcoin economy produces a realistic 5% more in goods and services than it did the prior year, each Bitcoin will gain about 5% in value; nowhere near enough, nor fast enough, to cause a catastrophic deflationary situation.
Keep in mind that the opposite holds as well - if an economy utilizing Bitcoins for exchange shrinks, the value of a bitcoin declines as well.

If it were a client side breach, it's very unlikely that only one or two banks would be affected.

If you invest USD$1,000 into Bitcoin mining, would you want to recoup your money to earn a return above and beyond the initial $1k? Of course. If you keep building your mining operation, growing it by a factor of 10x so that you're now $10,000 in, the situation remains the same - you'd want to pay off the hardware and earn a return. Consider that there are quite a few whom have invested $100,000+ into hardware. Why would they kill their golden goose? That would be like Amazon shutting down its profitable EC2 service.
We can continue with that line of thinking to understand why those mining operations that are now committed to Bitcoin will keep building and profiting. As the network grows, there will be more fees due to greater participation. An easy way to look at it is visualizing the numbers:
50BTC block reward now, halving every ~4 years. Fees are currently paid on a small percentage because of that. As competition grows for rapid transactions, more fees will be paid to gain priority. So we can look at the block reward in relation to fees, as they are inversely correlated.
The smallest fee would be 1 Satoshi, or 0.00000001BTC. Therefore, to provide an equal reward through bare minimum fees 5,000,000,000 transactions would have to occur per block: every 10 minutes. In actuality, fees are much greater than a single Satoshi, but still a minor fraction of transaction costs.
Assume the year 2021 and arrival of the "Third Halving" (spoken with emphasis to be all dramatic). By then, the block reward will be 6.25BTC (50/2=25.../2=12.5.../2=6.25).
The current 7-day transaction average is ~25,000 per day. We'll use 24,000 to make the calculation easier. At 24k/day that comes to 100 transactions per block. That would mean an average of 0.5BTC in transaction fees would be necessary for to satisfy a 50BTC block, but only 0.0625BTC after the Third Halving.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is still a very young system, so at least one order of magnitude increase in the user base would be relatively easy to achieve. This means that even if transaction fees were to be relied upon exclusively, they would rapidly become very minimal as global participation rose. If we assume that 1,000,000 individuals use and conduct transactions with Bitcoin today, two orders of magnitude growth would still be a relatively small 100,000,000 people. To fulfill a 50BTC block, the transaction fee would only have to be 0.005BTC on average. Using today's exchange rate of $6.50/BTC, that's the equivalent of $0.0008 (1/6.50=0.15384615...*0.005=0.00076923) - again, on average.
Another important factor for now is the exchange rate. As the relative value of Bitcoin rises, more competition will develop to grab a piece of the profit from mining. This was readily apparent during the 2011 bubble, as was the exodus in the aftermath. When the exchange rate rises and participation increases, it makes each Bitcoin more difficult to acquire due to that increased competition. Each block will become more valuable and smaller denominations will be necessary for transactions. This allows for greater transaction volume, resulting in more fees building up to reward miners for securing the system.
Presently, mining can be extremely profitable with hardware potentially hitting break-even in a matter of a few months. With increased competition and mining farms consisting of dozens or hundreds of units, an industry forms - this is happening now, with some of the largest operators being present on GLBSE. Profit will then become squeezed, hardware will take many months or years to pay off, and the potential for some degree of centralization might arise.
Even with a large amount of centralization, it will be very difficult to cause problems within the network. Vendor lock-in is a possibility, as is collusion, but those are topics for another thread.
I hope this has helped. Cheers!

Some napkin calculations can offer a decent guesstimate.
BFL supposedly has 100,000 chips on order. If each one can perform approximately 4.5GH/s the total capacity would be ~450TH/s. That's about 18x the current network's rate, so difficulty could be reasonably expected to increase similarly. The result would be a difficult of over 60mm.
Allowing for difficulty of up to 100mm would put ASIC ROI at 1-2 years; more inline with established businesses.

Right now, Bitcoin is merely catching sideways glances from authorities. Open advocacy of a sort that flaunts state decree *will* cause those glances to become direct stares.
A state can change its rules at any time, so regardless of whether the developers might be associated or not, it's best not to provide any material that might be remotely damning.
If a translation is forthcoming, so be it - nothing is stopping it from being done. The immediate association with a sanctioned nation could raise alarms, though. The core developers are integral, their time best spent working on the project than having to navigate the legal and political implications.

Definitely. Awareness and independent thinking are critical. It's like commercials advertising 3% cash back. Why wait for cash back? Give me the savings up-front! But who thinks that way? And if a person doesn't even know he could be getting 2% return per month instead of 2% per year, it doesn't make a difference.
What's more important is the merchants/vendors. Those who own the means of production have to maintain profitability or risk failure. Any advantage becomes tantamount to survival and success. That's where Bitcoin offers the greatest incentive: businesses using Bitcoin can undercut competition - *especially* if all transactions remain within the Bitcoin system instead of having to switch to and from fiat.
Even more of a factor is that those merchants/producers/vendors are the ones who determine what money will be. If they choose to accept casino chips, then that will be money. They've chosen dollars for decades. If they only accept bitcoins for their goods and services, consumers won't have any choice but to follow.
I strongly think the very concept of cryptocurrencies is powerful enough that it's imperative. I also think that Bitcoin is still flexible enough to adapt and evolve rather than become superseded by a variant. It's the best option going forward.

[Some insight](
* The operation is dependent upon Bitcoin
* There's plenty of room to continue it
* It wouldn't be worthwhile to kill the golden goose
An operation like this based in a traditional currency would be highly suspect, of course. With Bitcoin, and the extent of development and community involvement Pirate has undertaken, there is a far greater likelihood of his coming out way ahead if Bitcoin succeeds on a large scale than if it fails.
Consider this: running off with all of the funds he's managing now would amount to maybe a few million USD. By helping to build the system to a point where Bitcoin is a globally-recognized name and widely used as a form of savings in addition to a transaction currency, he would easily become the equivalent of a multi-billionaire.
It's kind of like wondering why Mark Zuckerberg didn't sell out of Facebook when it was still young - he saw the potential of where it could, and did go.
There are *many* people in the Bitcoin community with recognition of this potential. In fact, on a relative basis, anyone with more than about 30 BTC (~$250) would be at least the equivalent of a billionaire should the Bitcoin economy grow to the size of the US dollar's current global standing. Even gaining to 1% of global wealth would make multi-millionaires out of the lowliest Bitcoin holders today, and given the multitude of benefits offered by the Bitcoin system, that's entirely feasible by the end of this decade.
The key to that growth on a sustainable basis is stability. That's something which Pirate is helping to provide by *influencing* the online exchange markets to prevent bubbles like that seen in 2011. From stability comes an appeal for businesses; then consumers follow because businesses can offer lower prices than via traditional methods - similar to how fuel stations often offer a discount for cash payment. It's really only a matter of time.

Some good answers on the possibility of recovering private keys.


To change the key generation algorithm would require adoption of an update by the majority of miners.


There shouldn't be any major issues, as the existing system should be able to simply state that the bitcoin(s) are being transferred to a new address, which would be generated using the new method. It might take a bit for users to follow once miners have made the change, but otherwise things should be relatively simple and straightforward.


We don't. So long as there's an incentive to use the system, there will be an incentive to protect it by adapting and improving. If the miners risk losing their assets, they'll take steps to protect them - if that means changing the key generation algorithm, it's more than likely that they will.


An incentive structure exists here as well - would it be worthwhile for an organization to attempt recovery of an address that's had funds move in the past year, or one that hasn't had activity for 5+ years?
Is it right for someone to keep ancient Roman gold coins that they unearth on their property? Where is the cut-off, and who gets to determine it? How about whether recovering potentially lost assets is good for the system? Could a corporation or government still claim century-old assets?
The responsibility for assets in the Bitcoin system is placed squarely on the owner. If he cannot protect his assets, no amount of intervention will be able to prevent him from losing them one way or another. It's a risk inherent to life.
As client software becomes more intuitive and safer to use, protecting Bitcoin assets will grow easier.

[Why Bitcoin is a better choice than gold]( Both could certainly coexist and even act in a complementary fashion for a time. Gold's operation as a reserve would remain supported by custodial banking services, providing the ability to transact globally at the expense of trust. Bitcoin would continue in similar fashion, only needing existence of the network instead of third parties; its only real threat being widespread network disruption.

Local OTC transactions are not necessarily for avoiding the blockchain. They act as a way to break the chain of ownership.
Here's an example:
Person A sells bitcoins to person B for fiat cash. To do so, person A executes a transaction to person B's address. Cash then exchanges hands, and the two parties go their separate ways.
The transaction will show in the blockchain, but there's no way to make a direct connection between the parties involved. If no personally identifying information was shared between them, deniability is airtight.

Saving would've protected the western financial system from its present meltdown and precluded Bitcoin's growth. Divisibility is entirely relevant, as it means the available supply can grow indefinitely, and the system's value naturally rises or falls along with the overall size of the real economy which makes use of Bitcoin.

Those are concerns on the user side, which are valid. What I meant by no risk is that the merchant is safe in offering the option.
When a merchant accepts Bitcoin through a processor like Bitpay, Walletbit, or Paysius, there doesn't have to be any direct exposure to the system. The only danger is that the payment processor absconds, and the same risk exists with traditional systems. There's actually a benefit of no chargebacks, and processor fees are competitive.

Interesting, but this is mostly sensationalism. Multiple ~20k BTC transactions don't offer enough information to determine whether the funds are being exchanged, or simply moved to new addresses. Until public keys are linked to entities, that won't change.

The article is reasonably objective, but appears to be poorly informed from a technical standpoint. This seems to be the case for most people when they first encounter Bitcoin.
Anonymity is an overall non-issue, first because of the difficulty in linking an address to an individual, and second because of the potential for use in combination with software like [Open Transactions]( which offers [blinded tokens]( allowing untraceable transactions. At present, the anonymity issues apply primarily to transferring of funds into and out of the Bitcoin system - when remaining entirely within the system and not touching the fiat world, identification is exceedingly difficult.
The general suspicion surrounding Bitcoin's creation doesn't stand up well to examination of the technical implementation. If it weren't open source software, the concern would be more relevant. Since it's already widely distributed on a global basis in both end user adoption and development, any kind of successful tampering or attack is highly improbable.

Do not listen to anyone who tries to convince you that Bitcoin is doomed to failure and interest is collapsing. It's a marginally popular form of money which has more room to grow than shrink. People tend to get too invested and excited about failure and their comments are usually fueled by greed and the hope for their investments to gain popularity, so they try to hype collapse at every turn. I tried to tell people last November when they were dumping their Bitcoin holdings as it bottomed, but some people just don't listen, and I saw people lose insane amounts of money when it rose.

Capital moves quickly. Any retailer that can offer discounts that could otherwise be met only by direct cash transactions will be at a major advantage.
Now there's real potential for a major outfit like Amazon to start looking at alternatives, although I'd expect those kind of established players to attempt less disruptive technologies first, like Dwolla or Square. As zero confirmation transactions become available, that will change.
With dollars as a basis, the fees for Bitcoin amount to fractions of a cent even for microtransactions. There is no traditional competition to that without a massive scale of batch transactions, and that isn't even considering fraud, which is nigh impossible with Bitcoin.
That future may be much closer than expected.

The hidden service is anonymous through Tor, of course.

You wouldn't use Zimbabwe dollars, yet that's the path most government monies are on. There's still relative stability now, but the threshold of change is shrinking rapidly.
When the threshold exceeds the ability to conduct transactions on a weekly to monthly basis, panic sets in and alternatives are sought. That is when real assets rise to prominence, but barter among them is highly inefficient. Not to mention that many governments are restricting and/or outlawing cash usage.
Credit networks and local currencies provide interim solutions, but a common platform is preferred, if not necessary. Global commerce requires one. Aside from gold held in custodianship, Bitcoin offers the best platform. It is actually more reliable than counterparty-dependent precious metals and fallibly-managed government money.

Gold and silver only worked to a point because their divisibility is limited by physical constraints on practical usability to about the 1 gram unit. If it weren't unrealistic to use individual gold atoms for transactions, the precious metals might still be in vogue instead of too limited a supply for daily use.
Bitcoin succeeds in this manner. Theoretically, it is infinitely divisible with a modification to lift the 8 decimal limit currently in place. As it is now, 8 decimal expansion *should* suffice for at least the first half of this century.

One problem: there is no 'commons'. TotC cannot be applied to an idea.
Bitcoin is not a public resource; it is entirely private. The source code is even provided through a voluntary agreement among private parties. There is reward, both internal and external.
Internally: a continuum between block rewards and an incentive for fees to be paid.
Externally: an escape from the existing system to a more stable, if not wholly proven, structural foundation.
This is not a single asset, resource, or even asset class. It is neither a mere commodity, nor currency. Bitcoin is the entire structure of a financial base (among other things) which is demonstrably superior on several major points. It is also highly adaptable and resilient, with a large and growing vested interest.

We can still discuss Bitcoin directly. Since the network itself is amorphous as sgornick alludes to, a tangential method of gauging fundamental strength is by talking with people.
From my own experiences and accumulated information, there are a number of high net worth individuals and organizations that have taken an interest in Bitcoin. Currently, most view it as a curiosity of insufficient size to handle major investment capital. However, there is a near-universal acknowledgement that Bitcoin bears close watching.
Multimillionaires can't get a decent entry point in a small market without making waves, possibly causing serious damage to what they're trying to invest in. That means if Bitcoin holds together and continues making progress, there is a cumulative pool of wealth in the 8-10 digit range which is waiting for a little more growth to make entry.

Although the bored/lonely comment was a bit absurd, you've taken it somewhat out of context. Any high net worth individual may become a target of demagoguery. Rapid wealth accumulation can make any person a target. By sharing the majority of profits with anyone participating, growth of the operation is accelerated *and* a support base is developed. If it's open to all at any level, accusations of glass ceilings become illegitimate; the only barrier to entry is awareness.
Basically, a rising tide raises all ships. However, in traditional economies, many ships are held underwater through debasement of savings. Like the monetary precious metals, any Bitcoin holder cannot have their savings debased, so investment opportunities really do raise everyone up.
The exception is if the deposited funds are absconded with. While there have been and still are scams, there are also unbelievable opportunities - it would be a shame to discount everything in a high risk/high reward environment as a fraud.


It's suspected that Satoshi Nakamoto individually and/or other 1st-year adopters may have holdings in excess of 10% - currently ~960k BTC.


Lending isn't a deliberate action? Obtaining bitcoins and investing them isn't deliberate action? There is no 'effortless' way to acquire bitcoins, especially now.
Today, it would require about 9k BTC to hold the equivalent of USD$100k. That's a substantial sum for most, yet a small amount of assets in relation to established economies. Almost a year ago, it would've taken 40k BTC to equal $100k. Lending operations in the Bitcoin economy are pulling wealth from other pools, such as the Euro and USD. A portion of that wealth then resides within the Bitcoin economy, expanding the system as a whole. That growth process is accelerated as investment increases, and there's still plenty of room to grow.


I assume you're referring to Pirate. If we were talking about a mature system with a saturated market, I'd be inclined to agree that the problem were being made worse.
Bitcoin is growing, but it needs stability to attract business interests and larger stores of wealth. Maintaining stability during rapid growth requires a lot of effort. Borrowing is effectively a quicker way to building the resources to provide stability, which in turn leads to greater investment.


Nice contradiction: you wonder why the money isn't simply given away, but you said that if the recipients weren't able to earn it themselves, they'd probably lose it. How did they obtain the initial funds to invest in the first place? How much rational thought goes into weighing the pros and cons of investing, let alone using Bitcoin?
There's a common theme of intelligence and progressive thinking among those in the Bitcoin community, otherwise the majority probably wouldn't recognize the potential and have holdings in what many claim "can't be money". Independent thinking seems more prevalent than with many other communities.


How does a business build its client base? If people don't trust or believe in it, the greatest product ever made could amount to nothing without a good reputation behind it. It's the difference between Richard Branson and Gerald Hyvinson. If *Sir* Richard Branson offered to start a business with someone, they'd jump at the chance. Gerald Hyvinson who? Not so much. Reputation is the most important thing for a business.
If a company were to produce an engine capable of getting 1000mpg without disclosing how it was done, and then decided to return 90% of profits on its enormous amount of sales as a weekly dividend to investors, would that be suspected as illegal?
Most people don't understand how the various components of one particular lending operation work together to provide such high returns. That's not even going into how it can continue for many more months or potentially years. There's already an example of how it works - for decades the major international banks, especially the BIS, have been doing in the gold and silver markets exactly what BTCS&amp;T is doing in Bitcoin.


The important thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is *not* other capital markets. It's infinitesimal by comparison now, yet its potential is even greater than the major currencies that exist today.
Wild returns do encourage a focus on accumulation, although by the same token this *is* a once-in-a-dozen-lifetimes opportunity. Investing can be a highly subjective decision, and playing it safe is never a bad choice.

It's good to see open-ended communication.
Pragmatically, there's no way to avoid the traditional financial system right now. The danger in this is that fiat-based systems are like a quicksand foundation - the rules can change at any time.
By making use of Bitcoin alongside fiat, Balanced can both offer an additional service as well as protect itself from what is effectively currency vendor lock-in. When used exclusively as a wealth transfer system, exchange rate volatility is a negligible risk. If a pool is needed, that's a somewhat different story.
No matter what path is chosen, Balanced's services are valuable. It would be good to have the flexibility and resiliency to structure them atop various currencies.
@_date: 2012-07-28 00:55:26
You're absolutely right - for lenders to Pirate, the exchange value doesn't matter.
The relative price stability is important for businesses operating in traditional economies. There are many reasons that a business may choose to utilize Bitcoin, and it wouldn't take many to provide a strong demand - a single company could provide enough capital flow to keep the Bitcoin price stable.
This is where I see the external part of Pirate's operation coming into play - it's helping to supply demand organically. Last year, he stated that local interest provided a sizable level of demand for bitcoins. It's reasonable to expect that demand to have risen. Of course, in order to maintain that interest for any business activities, it would be critical to have very low risk of loss due to short term exchange fluctuations.
I've noticed local demand increasing as well, especially since the $5 level was breached. The external side is very important because wealth is flowing from outside sources *into* Bitcoin, sort of kick-starting the smaller economy. If Pirate were to cease activity, exchange volatility would probably increase as the primary participation reverts to speculation. An economy built on gambling alone is unsustainable - there has to be a solid, productive foundation to maintain it; preferably composed of a diverse range of businesses. Otherwise, any investment in such a system really does become like a Ponzi.
Most growth in the Bitcoin economy from external flow will be at the margin. This means that any business which chooses to keep part of its profit in the Bitcoin system will be contributing to the system's size and strength. Even if 99% of the funds that flow into Bitcoin are pulled out right away on a continuous basis, that consistent 1% residual amount accumulates over time. Again, that requires stability relative to external pools of wealth.
Closer to the $1 billion market size, as opposed to ~$80mm now, the Bitcoin system should begin to approach self-sustainability.

Ripple is a very good idea and meshes wonderfully with decentralized forms of money.
Freicoin, which is a variant of Bitcoin with demurrage, is a solution in search of a problem. It works well enough as a check on governmental monetary mismanagement, but there is no need for it where savings in Bitcoin (or gold) are involved.
If Bitcoin were to implement demurrage, coins would eventually become worthless in the same way inflation gradually destroys the purchasing power of today's government-sponsored currencies. It is antithetical to Bitcoin, and makes sense only from the perspective of economic schools where savings is considered a bad thing.

Toiling in the mud for a good cause generally is. Keeping the situation in perspective is important.


When the major western governments take steps to amputate, Bitcoin will be strong enough to withstand direct state onslaughts.

It sounds like it's being used in a different way than Bitcoin does. A blockchain credit record would be vulnerable to compromise in ways the Bitcoin network isn't, *if* it were to be used the way Bitcoin works.
What I think is happening is adoption of a blockchain structure in a capacity of distributed reputation verification - decentralised Bitcoin-OTC. It can also store all associated credit history. What it can't do is act as a base unit - a majority of network participants would have to sign every transaction, which is unrealistic and wouldn't scale.

Security in the area of Bitcoin is very much dependent upon personal responsibility, but a few simple steps can make things pretty easy. I'll highlight two major ones that will protect against the vast majority of theft.
Always use [two-factor authentication]( whenever possible. [Google Authenticator]( makes this very simple to accomplish. At Mt. Gox, look in the Security Center area for instruction on how to use it there.
Keep the majority of your Bitcoin assets in a private wallet, preferably offline using either a brain wallet or printed paper backup. Requiring physical access to the bulk of your wealth will largely prevent the kind of theft you experienced. The [Blockchain.info wallet]( service can help with this.

Oh, yes the exchange would have an account with a traditional bank. Deposits could be given a unique amount to identify which Bitcoin account to be associated, keeping an individual using the exchange unidentified.
For example, I create an anonymous account at said exchange through Tor. Next, I create a deposit request for $100 and the exchange specifies an amount of change up to $1 different, so $100.26 might be the necessary amount. The next time it might be $100.10 - again, just to identify the proper account on the Bitcoin side.

The service has built a reputation on its own. Submitting to the auspices of governmental oversight at best increases the cost of doing business, as shown by the ridiculous rise in fees, and at worst subjects the operation to undue external influence while creating a false sense of security. A stamp of approval from a governing body does not instantly mean everything is rosy.
There *will* be consequences beyond fee increases. I am reminded of Bitcoinica's attempt at gaining approval from the New Zealand government just before its failure.
Edit: the point is that Bitcoin has a position of strength while governments (and traditional finance in general) are weakening. They will eventually *have* to acknowledge and legitimize electronic forms of money regardless of cooperation, especially Bitcoin.

This argument has been discussed extensively. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible without reliance upon a counterparty. Interest rates are not a concern as with variable supply currencies.
As Bitcoin grows, there will be increasing incentives to spend instead of hoard. Saving is not a bad thing, despite what many "economists" proclaim.
There are other concerns, mostly technical, that are more likely to be difficulties along the way - economic issues are not the primary impedance to growth.
@_date: 2012-07-27 21:59:05


Yes. This is only part of the operation, though - there are aspects outside of the Bitcoin system. Wealth is flowing *into* Bitcoin through this external mechanism.


The operation is based upon the underlying system's growth. In other words, as long as Bitcoin itself has room to grow, Pirate's operation can keep returning. As Bitcoin's growth rate slows, so will return from Pirate.
What's important to note is that much of the growth is built on the downside rather than the upside, particularly during corrections. This means exchange rate stability is critical. If it goes too high too fast, the ability to make payments is in jeopardy. If it drops too low too quickly, there's the potential that the entire Bitcoin system could fail and Pirate, along with his investors, would be left holding the bag.
tl;dr - Buy and hold investors make a return on the flow; Pirate makes a return on the ebb.

A lot of what you suggest is valid, as much of the stock is being held onto. The flow is not as strong, but is steadily rising as can be seen from the velocity estimation indicated by [Bitcoin days destroyed](
Bitcoin, and almost anything else other than perishable goods, is better at *storing* wealth than rapidly debased fiat. Its mathematical foundation has been proven, although there are several other hurdles to overcome. Still, it's very unlikely that the system will fail entirely; more likely it will suffer periodic setbacks.
High net worth individuals often keep an eye out for alternatives and opportunities. Bitcoin is very appealing to that segment, especially when a disposable fraction of their assets can be put into the system and still offer a potentially enormous return.
For someone with USD$10mm in assets, a 1% or $100k Bitcoin investment *could* prove many times more valuable than the $10mm over the long term. The consideration is that fiat is growing unstable. Those with the wherewithal to see the writing on the wall understand this all too well, and are coming to view Bitcoin as a potent savings vehicle.
With that in mind, there are quite a few individuals and organizations with net worth greater than the entire Bitcoin cap whom are actively transitioning a significant share of their fiat assets into Bitcoin, as well as physical assets like gold and real estate. This has to be done at a measured pace to prevent major disruption.
As for global cultures, Bitcoin is understood more readily in many emerging regions than most western nations. Adoption by waves of individuals in places where traditional forms of money exchange are *not* visible on exchanges is equivalent to dark pools. It's almost impossible to gauge that influence, but it is possible that pricing is heavily affected by off-exchange transactions.

@_date: 2012-08-03 08:22:30
One reason: If one individual were to hold an overwhelming majority of an asset pool, that becomes a disincentive for others to participate. Therefore, instead of accumulating only monetary wealth, other forms of wealth like reputation and association can be accrued by sharing the profits. Then you also have people around you whom are capable of playing at your level - you won't get bored or lonely.
Too much emphasis is placed on accumulation of money when it is the things money can help to obtain that are more important.

From: [


This seems to suggest that a central price-fixing institution will be necessary for ensuring pricing remains stable and doesn't disrupt operation of the demurred money. That means reliance upon a third party to police an unknowable quantity of participants, each engaging in momentary transactions; a command economy - repeatedly shown to fail.
Banks are also expected to provide access to pooled investment, dealing with expiring currency and promising to return the full amount deposited. This assumes all the risk involved with demurrage. What incentive does a bank have to assume all risk? There's no room for error or recovery, and again there is reliance upon a third party.
What happens if birth rates slow and a surplus of currency enters the market? Prices will fluctuate, currency issuance rates will have to change, and banks will be at increased risk for no reason of their own. There would be a greater incentive for the banks to return expiring currency while holding fresh money.
If an engine must constantly run at high speed, it will fail more quickly than if it could return to idle for a period. As lubricating oil is burned off, having no reserve means seizure is guaranteed to occur. No savings means no buffer against unpredictability.

Yes, the exchange takes on the risks. As you suggest, it would probably need to be established in a safe haven, or reject any deposits larger than what would trigger AML/KYC reporting.
If the exchange, using Tor or not, catered to local exchangers in a heirarical manner, a highly distributed system could be built. It wouldn't be purely decentralized, but the sheer number of participants holding their own accounts would make it very difficult for banks to shut them down. It would essentially be a supporting service for local Bitcoin traders, creating a near-turnkey solution for anyone interested in participating. This would also allow for management of service quality, similar to franchising.
Until a truly automated and decentralized system is created, I don't see many other options.

It looks like they're stating that because the *possibility* exists for a change to the protocol, it can't be strictly defined as Selgin does. The limit is arbitrary, even if the probability of a change taking hold decreases as the system grows.
It's also possible to extend the unit divisibility through protocol changes, regardless of whether that's intended or not. Although this would be beneficial, it's possible to imagine how social perspective could come to view modifying the supply limit as beneficial as well, much as how many people today see paper currency as having value over real assets when the opposite view was dominant prior to that abstraction.
I don't agree with Bitcoin being classified as a fiat currency, though its use and behavior do have similar aspects. In particular, it cannot be classified the way any other currency is because it is not simply a distinct unit, but a fully integrated transaction system. The units could be considered fiat within the system, but have no meaning outside the context of that system. Also, the system itself is incompatible with any other form of unit: only properly formed, abstract mathematical constructs work. The system itself is not fiat.

Commodity forms of money like gold and silver accumulate value over time as credit that has been extended (debt) is actualized - when the crop is harvested, or a finished good is produced. The stock to flow ratio of tangible goods is closely related.
That distinction was intentionally avoided, probably to avoid confusion. What Bitcoin does is combine the best aspects of fiat - abstraction and unrestricted supply - with the best of commodity money - immutability and limited supply.
The apparent contradiction between limited and unrestricted supply is solved with the hard upper limit on full units, yet retains the ability to infinitely sub-divide units - theoretically. Capabilities of technology put an ultimate limit on actual divisibility, although it's far greater than 8 decimal places. All it would require is a minor modification to the software and subsequent propagation among network participants.

Banks and governments haven't stopped...


Which is it?
Neither. I see it as being done so that *everyone* has the opportunity to rise (PPTs allow as small as 1 BTC deposits). No man is an island. If I deny someone the opportunity to develop a cure for cancer, that's to my own detriment because I may get it someday. The same goes for accumulation for its own sake - what possible ideas and products might wither away for lack of funding because one individual controls all of the wealth that could be used to boost them?
In the situation we're talking about, there are entities like traditional banks with a primary goal of profit such that they're willing to squeeze the assets from their own clients to attain that goal. Most businesses look to maximize their profit margins, not pay out the majority of that margin. By running with this high yield profit sharing system and offering it to everyone, there's currently no way for any other style of wealth management to compete without bankrupting itself.
As BTCS&amp;T hits a ceiling on its growth and the rate of return declines, the same type of system could easily develop at a smaller scale. It may not be *as* successful as the original, but it would be another wave to be ridden, one that would even erode some of the former. This would be like throwing a rock into a calm pond - the first one causes the greatest amount of disruption.
Remember that rich in terms of Bitcoin is only now approaching the level of retirement funding for much of the world's middle class; a community doxing effort could very well lead to angry victims showing up at a perpetrator's door with intentions to do more than just request their funds back.
A [brief description]( of the reasoning is on the Bitcointalk.org forums.


Yes, and generally I'd agree with you. In this case, no amount of circular accounting can detract from what's actually being offered - Bitcoin. The system is what these investment programs are built upon and offering access to, so there's real value to be gained by participating. Of course, the two real risks are that Bitcoin fails or the operators abscond.


So it's also illegal to formulate new medications without publishing the formula? What about military technology, or any form of proprietary software? Would it be against the law to run a business a certain way that made it more productive than its competitors, and not tell clients how?


The investment *is* Bitcoin. The offerings may not all be capitalizing on it in the same way, but they're certainly all making use of the system's rapid growth. If I told a business owner that he could cut costs on transaction fees, allowing him to expand margins by 1-2% on $100mm in sales, the answer would be a resounding "YES, HOW?"


An [outline]( Understanding cyclical capital flows is necessary.


Not necessarily. Let's say I see a very strong correlation with a method that has worked for many years. The pattern is too similar to what exists in precious metals markets to be coincidence. There are also [several other components]( involved which *could* operate independent, but would work best synergistically in support of BTCS&amp;T. Each component could realistically and consistently return around 1-3% per week, but all of them together make for a steady 7%+ weekly.
The only critical requirement for BTCS&amp;T to remain in operation is that the BTC exchange rate must continue to climb *steadily* without any major price shocks - no bubble spikes, no selling-induced collapses, etc. Since BTCS&amp;T began in late 2011, price had risen in fits and starts until January 2012. A steady decline wore on until stabilizing at $5 from March through May.
I suspect that was the time when BTCS&amp;T had grown to a point where it needed more flow of BTC than was present in the markets at that time. From the end of May on, the price rise has attracted both new investment into Bitcoin as well as created the incentive for existing holders of Bitcoin to start selling their stock of coins - effectively to BTCS&amp;T. The rising price of BTC is what allows that process, and BTCS&amp;T, to persist.
To visualize the process, think of a tire or wheel - it only contacts the surface it's on with a small part of its total area. As long as there is a smooth enough surface that it can roll on, it'll keep rolling.
To get from point A to point B, we ride in cars on smooth surfaces - the same applies to businesses; they prefer smoothly operating markets. Businesses and investors that are attracted to Bitcoin add to the flow of capital in the system, which provides the demand that keeps propelling the Bitcoin wheel along the smooth surface. If the wheel is big enough, it can be used with a car or truck instead of a child's wagon. Bigger than that, and it can be used with industrial equipment.
After all is said and done, BTCS&amp;T *could* wind up as another [MyBitcoin]( joining the growing trend of fraud in the world of traditional finance as exemplified by [MF Global]( [PFGBest]( and [Knight Capital]( However, I think that BTCS&amp;T is much more legitimate than it seems at first glance. In any case, I still wouldn't recommend throwing *everything* into it - or anything else for that matter.

Frequent flyer miles have developed into a billion-dollar field. The potential for a resilient, general-purpose currency without the risk factors involved with central authority is immense. Bitcoin could very realistically reach a significant percentage of global trade. It can do that best if it's perceived as stable.
Therefore, managing the exchange value of Bitcoin to prevent excessive volatility during its ascent is protection of an investment.

The structure of the [Ripple project]( is that of an electronic [Hawala]( network. That's a closer analog to contemporary fiat-based credit systems.
A blockchain-like universal credit record would solidify the history of the system, and when a debt is paid off, it could be pruned while leaving a rating for the parties involved.
Bitcoin is itself a unit, combined with a P2P transaction network, functionally similar to gold and associated dealers around the world; Ripple is a credit network with debt capable of being denominated in any unit of account, including Bitcoin - effectively like securitised assets in the traditional financial world.
Since it is a credit network, there is the potential for repayment failure. That can cause widespread disruption if a cascade of defaults were to occur. If that were to happen, the unit denomination of the debt would be the ground level to which any collapse could fall; a safety net of sorts. For this reason, Bitcoin and Ripple complement each other very nicely, perhaps perfectly.
It is interesting to see some overlap forming, from Bitcoin with smart contracts and the like, to the Ripple side borrowing the blockchain concept to facilitate universally instantaneous transactions. The former provides a foundation and the latter enables flexible growth as a derivative of the underlying asset.
There's no need for Bitcoin users to feel threatened, nor for Ripple enthusiasts to harbor resentment. These developments are a *Very Good Thing*.

One of the things to keep in mind is knowing your audience, as well as the present state of what you're advocating. Bitcoin is not quite ready for prime-time yet, but awareness will help prepare those around you for what's coming.
You *will* get a lot of resistance, possibly even undue amounts of ridicule. It's natural, as people have a strong desire to be "right" even to the point of rejecting factual information. It's also very difficult to grasp an idea without a concrete example.
In regard to businesses, the biggest selling point is that it costs almost nothing to accept Bitcoin. It's good to note that the system is growing rapidly and exists in almost every country on the planet, making international sales nearly as easy as local ones; the fees are the same regardless of where someone is.
A good way to overcome the concrete example hurdle is by carrying a [Casascius physical coin]( Make sure the distinction between the value of the coin and the value of the key is clear. It's the same as the difference between the relatively worthless value of representative paper money and the actual socially agreed-upon exchange value.

Definitions are good common ground. By that definition, yes, Bitcoin would be a public good. And yes, it has economic utility.
A healthy system can support a certain amount of excess, and there's almost always a means to make use of it. There could be more thinking outside the box among the Bitcoin community than anyone expects.
The way Bitcoin is structured is still a concept, and it would probably become a philosophical point to debate whether the TotC applies.


Technical flaws certainly do exist, although I don't see them as being the primary factors in a decline because clearly definable limits are rarely the ideal vector of attack - they're too obvious a point of defense.
I'm more concerned about vague weaknesses that can be exploited subtly and with less direct effort. That generally involves distortion of the use case, as can be seen with financial derivatives obscuring real asset value.
With the potential magnitude of growth open to Bitcoin, I think it could be decades before the system matures and then becomes susceptible to those pressures. The ease of lateral expansion using merged mining could make eventual transition much easier than with existing fiat currencies.

This assumes mining for mining's sake. There are many reasons other than control and monetary accumulation for which organizations would need to maintain a stable blockchain.
There is also the rising potential of client competition wherein client software creators compete with each other to develop the most effective fee calculation. With maturing interfaces, the differentiating elements will include speed of transactions. Capacity will be utilized to a point of saturation regardless of 2nd level capability, so long as there is profit to be made.
Also, lateral expansion may do more to enforce mining responsibility than the above. As Bitcoin evolves and cryptocurrencies in general mature, the best in class can be forked or duplicated, rapidly presenting a direct competitor to an excessively concentrated blockchain.

Some information has been brought forward about his financial background. One post indicates [day trading]( experience, and others have suggested deeper financial industry background.


Yes, and I have my suspicions that his operation is not only providing depth online, but offline as well. It seems that we can both agree the price action last week from USD$7.5 to $9+ was [in danger]( of becoming a blow-off bubble top. The knock-down brought the price level back in-line with the highs of the prior week, reversing only the two day spike. 
From the [IRC log](


Price continued rising despite Pirate warning on IRC to stop the wild buying. Because it kept happening even after several knock-downs, what was shown is that the Bitcoin system and trading environment are much larger than those participating in the channels and forums. Pirate may be able to heavily *influence* exchange rates, but he cannot blatantly control them; Bitcoin is bigger than he is, including his investors.
What was done was like shouting at a child about to run into a busy street - sometimes it needs to be done. It may have seemed like a large jump, but it only guided [irrational exuberance]( back to a stable state.
There will be no default, even partial, without a very large exchange rate spike *and* Pirate being caught with excess funds outside of the Bitcoin system. He has stated that his exposure to such a situation is very short term and minimized as much as possible to prevent exactly that risk. Exchange rates would probably have to double in a matter of hours to present that kind of threat.
Beyond that, I've already outlined how this can continue until the Bitcoin system itself is no longer growing. Spend some time to understand how the [gold and silver futures markets are being used to manage their rise in fiat currency denominations]( and you will have a better understanding of what Pirate is doing.

No, this is not a black &amp; white issue - there isn't any hostility toward Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a boon for sharing knowledge, but is also actively impeding progress in other areas. This is less about Wikipedia than it is the payment processors being used - wherever possible I refuse to make use of credit cards, PayPal, Amazon, or most other traditional methods for moving money.
Rationally, I cannot condone usage of destructive services. Practically, I alone cannot stop them.


Absolutely - we all act in our own self-interest. Nothing would ever happen if we didn't. This particular policy happens to be to the benefit of many while threatening the few holding the most power.
There's almost no barrier to accepting Bitcoin. It can be used as a transfer system only - the Wikimedia foundation never has to hold BTC, *ever*. The cost being lower is just a bonus.
From the client/consumer side, the greatest benefit is choice. At the moment, there is only a limited selection from among highly similar options, as they are all built upon the same financial foundation. On the business side, a growing market is inaccessible.
PayPal can put pressure on merchants with impunity, exemplifying  [vendor lock-in](  (like the link?). Collectively, individuals can put pressure on merchants in the opposite direction. The tipping point won't be reached until Wikipedia can sustain itself on donations exclusively from the Bitcoin economy, but the idea can and should be proposed; repeatedly.
As Bitcoin grows, it is only a matter of time until merchants see their margin and revenue decline, and *must* offer it as a payment option; to the detriment of PayPal. I retain the prerogative to choose where I put my wealth, and when there is a genuine choice, Wikipedia will get a healthy donation from me.

Traditional authorization and financial systems are ill-suited to an IoT world. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has enough internal autonomy to handle it.
The ASICs being developed don't have to be for mining. A function-specific circuit is safer than a general purpose processor. You're right in that this is Qualcomm's play. What we'll probably wind up with is something like an ASIC app store.
Additionally, there are distributed technologies that make perfect sense for ASICs, one of which is transmit beam forming. This is a wireless technology that [Artemis Networks]( in particular has been working on and claims to have succeeded at. Using ASICs, Qualcomm could enable a scalable meshnet type of system with reasonable power requirements.
The incentive structure is where Bitcoin might come into play. Each device with these ASICs would be able to offer communications routing. Each device utilizing such a network would maintain a Bitcoin balance, and each device offering access would receive.
The Bitcoin network would obviously need to have its TPS rate issues solved, but that's just a matter of time.

Nearly eliminated with tx beamforming.


Tx beamforming can sort of encapsulate and virtualized existing wireless protocols. It's a different way of handling RF that actually simplifies a great deal.
The AAA logic is where Bitcoin comes in. It doesn't need to be added to wireless protocols since it doesn't operate at the same OSI layers.
Yes, centralized is easier. It also requires increased and potentially unmanageable overhead at massive scales.
Thinking in terms of transactions only is limiting. Devices requesting assistance from other nearby devices and *negotiating* with them to get tasks done will increase communications traffic by orders of magnitude. Most of this communication will be constant, in the immediate area and real-time (on the order of microseconds).

Physical retail is a high-visibility use for Bitcoin that is not ideally suited yet. Apple is experiencing plenty of resistance there as well.
Personal preference in online retailers is not a reliable metric, especially if confined to a single geopolitical region.
The infrastructure I'm referring to involves development libraries and interfaces that will facilitate not only retail sales but activities that people didn't know they had to have because the possibility didn't exist before. It's the kind of change that the iPhone created, which made mobiles the crux of daily life.

You can't examine Bitcoin in isolation from other developing technologies without missing potentially major points.
Currently that example falls appear, but transmit beamforming can handle the latency and movement of such an example. The approach involves constant recalculation of RF waveforms to create constructive interference patterns at the intended target point. It's a major shift from current radio communications that's only possible with significant processing capacity.

And more - Bitcoin does offer functionality at several layers, so I think it's very difficult to analyze any one of them in isolation and conclude that Bitcoin is worthwhile.
WiFi never would've become as universal as it is today if each manufacturer had avoided a standard and taken their own direction. While some aspects of databases have a level of standardization, Oracle doesn't talk directly to Redis.
Agreed, examples are good. I'm no AA, but hopefully these will be a reasonable starting point.
Assume a database cluster and a comparable set of Bitcoin nodes serving a metropolitan area. Both should be able to support zero downtime. First, what is the amount of effort needed to configure and secure either?
Let's say a device is looking for network access rates. What does it ask for from the db cluster? Is there bid/ask logic in stored procedures or is it external to the db? Are the query and result guaranteed to be consistent across clusters using different db back ends? What happens in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:10:32
Blockchain (Bitcoin) sans unit (bitcoin) is no different from a centralized service. Sure, the technology can and probably will be used within larger organizations for greater accounting, collaboration and transparency. However, we'd be right back to a dozen different ways of doing the same thing - standardization be damned.

That's why traditional systems are ill-suited; manual provisioning and management suffers at scale and we're looking at billions and trillions of devices.

Devices could *securely* perform certain tasks on-demand using ASICs instead of general purpose CPUs. Activities include image analysis, audio processing, cryptographic functions (homomorphic acceleration?) and of course - mining.
Even more importantly, since this is Qualcomm, transmit beamforming has the potential to multiply wireless signal efficiency. The tradeoff is that it requires significant signal processing. If that can be handled in a distributed fashion by all of the devices in a defined area working together, issues related to bandwidth and signal propagation might become historical oddities. Even latency could be improved.

Including a fee is one factor. The age of the coin is another, as is the amount the payment is being pulled from. When a transfer is made, it's like splitting large bills into change with the payment amount going to the recipient.
For example, if you pay with a $100 note and get $95 back, your transaction has more weight than passing with a $20 note. With the larger you may be able to avoid including a fee, which discourages spam transactions. The network will prioritize larger coins, and there may cone a point where transactions without any fee are simply not accepted in the system.
As for the attempts, it really isn't feasible after a couple of seconds - the entire Bitcoin network will know about the transaction and will refuse to include any seen later. If the business sees more than one spend attempt using the same coin within a few seconds, the sale can be rejected. Additionally, it will probably become an actionable offense the same way counterfeiting is today.

Fiat doesn't need to be decentralized. The transition from central management to distributed is a turbulent process in which the *movement* of traditional assets needs to have flexibility of options.

The gist of IBLT is that, since transactions propagate through the network during the window between finding blocks, you don't need all nodes to send the entire batch of transactions when a block is found because they'll have data on the majority of transactions already. All you need is enough information to figure out which transactions are in the new block and then rebuild that block locally - similar to how parity works.
The testing shows that a tiny amount of data can be used to enable nodes to calculate the correct block 99% of the time - the data amount being about 20Kb. If even less data is used, the estimated error rate increased to 8%. Since not many nodes would encounter that 1-8% error rate at the same time, they would recover during the next time window before another block is generated. One method of recovery would be for the node to request the full block as the network currently operates.
@_date: 2015-11-06 13:00:33
Yes, confirmation occurs on average every ten minutes. Existence of the transaction is known within seconds throughout the Bitcoin system, which is the primary piece of information that zero-confirmation methods use.
In combination with looking at whether a transaction fee was included, history of the address and other metrics, a confidence rating is obtained that suggests how likely the transaction week be to confirm - this usually takes only a few seconds to attain 95%or greater certainty. Once the confirmation finally happens, the transaction is effectively irreversible.
For small purchases it generally wouldn't be worthwhile to attempt double spending. In addition, the confidence algorithm could be run on a modest piece of hardware owned by the business, making the cost of such a service negligible - almost certainly less than fraud prevention in the current banking system.

It doesn't matter who uses Bitcoin; it's who accepts it that counts.
Bitcoin is neutral, unlike SWIFT or any other traditional banking system. Russia and the US would find it nearly impossible to agree on any payment system built by the other side, or even a collaborative venture. Bitcoin is effectively a reversal - it is nearly impossible to be locked out of it, especially when mining infrastructure is distributed.
Not to mention security and machine-to-machine purposes, both far more difficult and unreliable to do centrally, and gradually growing in value.
Still, this is a transitional process, not an overnight shift. The infrastructure is being built out and will likely be an overwhelmingly positive option between now and 2020. It just take time.
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:13:10
Non financial purposes, hopefully. Blockchain based key exchange and distribution would allow for security to focus less on the perimeter. Authentication, verification, payment... potentially even mesh routing assistance from mobile devices making use of non-IP based networking (along the lines of Namecoin).
With that functionality embedded everywhere and a massively distributed mining infrastructure (alongside massively concentrated hardware), Bitcoin becomes a core component of society's DNA.
Monetization doesn't have to come from mining or other financial services, as Qualcomm builds and sells hardware. Additional features, particularly revolutionary ones, would indirectly result in sales increases.
It would be interesting to see estimates on a billion ASIC hashing processors against mining farms - I'd guess the difference would be within an order of magnitude. This would also bring about another collaborative duality in Bitcoin of dedicated miners versus distributed devices.

Messaging, auditing, storage, directory, etc. It can automate numerous services while increasing security and simplifying manageability.
Unlike Bitcoin as a public ledger, private ones aren't strictly constrained by storage or consensus limitations. There is administrative participation involved and the tools will eventually mature to handle relevant tasks, much like ACLs today.
Simultaneously, interoperability with Bitcoin is fully possible. It's likely to become a necessity - the public ledger offers a level of history and verification that a private one simply cannot match.

User demand for credit (by people including you and I) forces money creation, so governments printing money is really a non-issue (until the value fluctuates so wildly that confidence is lost).
What centralized systems cannot do is provide an independent and impartial platform that can be accessed as readily as the air we breathe. This is critically necessary for global integration and beyond, not just financially but for numerous transactional services (think Internet of Things). Elements of banks are net positive for society and will be retained while the rest will be rendered irrelevant by Bitcoin.
So yes, I agree there is a real win. Not quite as you suggest, and the shift is a gradual process, but it's happening.

Debt denomination is the real issue. Contacts can be made using the blockchain and denominated in arbitrary assets, all *relative* to Bitcoin's unit value.
Greece could reintroduce the drachma for domestic use with market-rate convertibility to Bitcoin, allowing for the debts to be denominated in drachmas. That would be a short-term solution as it is likely Bitcoin will push other currencies out of international markets. Debts would eventually be rolled over to either Bitcoin when its value stabilizes, or any number of other asset classes.

Do [this]( instead. Closing the supply loop is far more productive than another attempt at prepaid WiFi, which cannot stand on its own but must be part of a more comprehensive offering (which is why Cisco, Aruba, et al. are still in business).
If you still choose to pursue this path, look into integration with other companies in this space such as Purple WiFi or Yadwire (avoid others, their products it business models are lacking).
Another approach that would be higher impact and far better for users is creation of an OTT (media delivery Over-The-Top of any data service, cable, fiber, etc) app for Roku or Chromecast style platforms. One possibility is a tool to simply accept Bitcoin payments that obtains a purchase code for other video streaming solutions like Vudu or M-Go. The key would obviously be to make the process seamless for the user.

Agreed. But... there's always a 'but' isn't there?
Yes, Bitcoin offers a powerful alternative that has the potential to become a dominant global system. Its improvements make for incredible possibilities that simply would not be possible today.
Thinking about how Bitcoin could supplant our institutions only goes part of the way. We also should consider what the world would be like with a mature Bitcoin system in place, not just the benefits over today. A mature Bitcoin could be exploited numerous ways as Satoshi noted (I don't have links handy), so taking advantage of it *will* happen. Even indirect control of such a system has more catastrophic potential outcomes than anything else in history, including nuclear weapons.
We are working with tools of immense power that are capable of changing the very nature of our beliefs and perceptions. Bitcoin in isolation would probably have an overwhelmingly positive impact, but it is not a system growing in a vacuum - in conjunction with other technologies that are beyond human control and comprehension, we face existential threats.

This is the general idea behind ACH and other financial information exchange (FIX) standards. The problem with them is that they can be used for political purposes, severely damaging their economic strength in the process - the SWIFT system was used for this and is now being duplicated by numerous nations.

It's only partially inaccurate based on current technology. Aggregate bandwidth increases in a meshnet (Nokia &amp; Qualcomm have formal results from real-world testing), although latency magnifies. The keys to speed today are self-organization, caching and prioritization (propagation of content and functionality to the network edge, regardless of hosted location). These are things being addressed by small cells which started being deployed at an accelerating rate since late 2013.
There certainly are limits to how large a meshnet can get at present, mostly because of routing and hardware limits. ISPs won't be going away in the immediate future. However, there is *potential* for wireline connections being supplanted entirely - in a reasonable time frame (I'm estimating by ~2050).
Major carriers are struggling to keep this trend from making them irrelevant by gradually selling off macro infrastructure while shifting to hardware design and production.

Yes, and its best function is actually as a store of value. So, more a settlement mechanism than a transaction system, although that aspect is still better than most of the traditional solutions.

That would be like not discussing Bitcoin with anyone. Bitcoin users (esp. miners) have an incentive to talk about the system because wider use raises unit value and strengthens the network.

I think you're conflating monetary *unit* inflation - increase in the supply of money, with a rise in *prices*. Price inflation occurs due to one of two circumstances:
* Increasing monetary unit supply
* Decreasing amount of goods and services *relative* to monetary unit supply (which can either be static, or not decreasing as quickly as economic activity)

Would that be a different blockchain for each client, such that each is unique? If so, that would not be an improvement over a decentralized record.

The transcription appears to have been automatically generated, making the reading less than clear. There's no problem with the incentive structure, but it can't directly affect external factors.
Sending a few Satoshi to each full node connected at the time a block is generated would create an incentive for wider distribution of Bitcoin nodes and block propagation. Competing mining pools would be a little different, but only if a pool were able to reliably generate 2+ blocks sequentially. It's a variation on the 51% attack that might not require that amount of processing power to selectively target high mining fee blocks. However, it still runs the risk of revenue loss due to creating an orphaned block - essentially the same as variance.
tl;dr - potential attempt at gaming the protocol which is still vulnerable to variance; i.e. everything balances out in the end unless 51% sustained.

And I argued that this is short-sighted; wreckless growth has delayed consequences. Inflation is always a problem - it leads to destructive concentration of wealth in both booms and busts.


It is not the liquidity trap itself that is on/off, but the consequences. What makes a person decide to finally discard a comfortable old pair of shoes for a new pair?
A threshold is met whereupon circumstances shift to result in an opposite outcome from that intended; then the flow is reversed, dumping stored holdings. This is similar to equity market movements involving high-volatility sell-offs.


There's trust involved with that as well. Trust that the dollars won't be harmful to hold/use, trust that they'll be accepted, etc.

1. Fiat holdings returns a percentage
2. BTC holdings are likely to appreciate
Whether funds are in fiat or BTC, *some* kind of return occurs simply for holding a balance. If the fiat side is inflated away, BTC value will rise. If BTC value falls, fiat will be able to handle greater volume for the same amount. BIPS effectively makes the holding spread regardless of which direction gains - of course, much more if BTC continues rising.
Also, BIPS may change a modest withdrawal [fee](

Agreed. Generally, for people Rule's age (as he said), there has to be a tangible aspect or it doesn't seem legitimate. The difficulty there is that so much value is being created through *in*tangible means (think source code and 3D model designs) that "tangible" no longer carries the weight it used to.
Can anyone imagine a society *without* CAD modeling of industrial equipment? Or the control systems allowing anti-lock braking? Those are items with no counter-party, yet their very existence is abstract. Without them, we don't exist as we do now.
A gear by itself does nothing, but in a system aware of its use (regardless of what it's made out of), there is utility (is the wood or aluminium the gear is made of valuable alone, or the gear construct?). The same goes for gold - without awareness, it would be worthless. It's a matter of changing *form* and *perspective* that older generations are having a hard time adjusting to.

In an environment where rates are rising, our monetary inflation pushes up nominal process, yes. It's important to understand the dynamics from the property owner's perspective as well as the tenant's.
Rent can only be increased to what the market will accommodate. Beyond that, losses will be incurred due to excess vacancy which results in negative cashflow.
What *should* be happening in the US is an economic contraction - rent should be *declining* in most areas. However, government efforts to maintain fiat dominance are killing the purchasing power of currencies while keeping process stable - effectively suffocating everyone financially. Both the owner and tenant are bled dry to support the failing infrastructure; exactly the opposite situation that market forces create.

By this, I mean that offering a way to cooperate with Bitcoin instead of attacking it will seem like an extended olive branch.

Of those that refuse to voluntarily sacrifice some amount of their holdings, government can then label them tax cheats.

The more awareness and fear rises in government toward Bitcoin, the greater efforts at eradicating it will be.

Sure. From my understanding of how the system works, XRP have a fixed unit supply of 100,000,000,000 - and every transaction decrements that amount. Fees will be adjusted automatically. I assume they will rise for higher demand and slower tx propagation times, decrease for lower demand and faster tx propagation. XRP are effectively arbitrarily divisible.
Think of computer technology. A cutting-edge computer today may be ahead of 90% of other systems in existence, but in a few years it will be relatively useless. An original iPhone is incapable of running current systems (at least not without a *lot* of custom tweaking).
*Assuming a mature system*, that range of time is similar to the range of usable XRP - it will be a perpetual moving target, always getting smaller in denomination. For example: a 1% decrease of the amount of XRP in existence may be accompanied by a 1% decline in the tx fee.
At 100,000,000,000 XRP, fee = 1 XRP
At 1,000,000,000 XRP, fee = .01 XRP
At 100 XRP, fee = .000000001 XRP
That's the idea, not necessarily the exact numbers - fees will be adjusted by the network the way Bitcoin determines mining difficulty internally.
Because they have to be consumed to use the system, there are incentives formed that preclude holding them as savings. Reducing supply by saving will be somewhat self-defeating - whereas the Bitcoin network will experience decreasing volatility, using Ripple itself as a currency is likely to increase valuation volatility. This would balance itself out through decreased usage of the system, which reduces the value of the network - long-term savers could conceivably lose out.

Rather than exchanging BTC for EUR or USD, they can be traded for LTC - this allows an individual to remain entirely within the cryptocurrency environment instead of taking on the potentially greater risk of handling fiat.

Pool mining normally requires just pointing your mining software at a pool address and allowing it to run.

P2Pool is effectively the same as running your own mining pool in addition to the mining software. It also requires a full Bitcoin node to be running.
Required software:
* P2Pool

The idea for Ripple has been around for some time, and there have been attempts at building an infrastructure.

This may be a very good idea, actually. Not by implementing it in the Bitcoin protocol or client, though.
The compensation structure would best be determined by active miners, as in a multi-address transaction being sent - like a donation from miners to active nodes. With that incentive, I imagine there would be an uptake in full nodes available.
If the donation were 1 Satoshi per full node at 10mm nodes, there would be 10,000,000 Satoshis per block, or 1 BTC in donations. Currently, there are less than 10k active nodes, although Blockchain.info shows as many as [1.6mm total]( nodes seen.

It's possible to do in principle, and is no secret - it's what governments attempt by calculating GDP. However, obtaining the information and weighting each variable is virtually futile in my opinion; there is no magical formula, as the variables are constantly changing. Statistical analyses can be interpreted or methods adjusted to arrive at wildly different conclusions.
Grossly distorted valuation can be observed without having to acquire volumes of data, and generally provides greater returns for the amount of work involved. Coming back to Bitcoin, it's plain to see that the incentive structures involved with the fiat financial world are antagonistic toward users of the system. Contrast that to the comparatively welcoming environment seen with cryptocurrencies, and investing in Bitcoin is almost a no-brainer.
For a different example, look at Apple versus Blackberry circa 2007-2008. The sheer simplicity and usability of touch slates mobiles was a thorough shift in how users interacted with their devices. Anyone who handled an iPhone could attest to that, showing the rift between paradigms and resulting value dislocation.

No, it can't. If governments were all-powerful, alcohol wouldn't exist, and water would flow uphill.
Governments couldn't erase BitTorrent or stop the proliferation of encryption technologies. All it can do is resist them for a while until it loses the fight. Ideas spread - period. At its core, Bitcoin is an idea that has been actualized.


If that were the only place Bitcoin could be used, I'd agree. It is not - [cryptocurrencies are applicable universally](
Why do you think Wordpress decided to use the system? Can the US stop payments through Bitcoin from blacklisted nations? The answer is no.


The money you get in the Bitcoin system is not dollars or euros, and there is no way for it to be forfeited without voluntary cooperation. This is a situation where control does not exist, and the chain of ownership allowing for tracking can be easily broken.


It isn't just an idea - the system is functioning today. It also coexists with traditional systems. The risks to implementing it are virtually non-existent compared to the benefits.
As I said earlier, governments are destroying the ability of businesses to maintain themselves. Given a choice between existing or closing down, Bitcoin is a means by which existence can be preserved. This is a process in which the beast is starved; it cannot be stopped.


Too much emphasis on things that are "illegal" - the world is not the US. Determining whether a packet of data is a search engine request or a Bitcoin transaction is nearly impossible - there is no practical way to stop it, just as there is no practical way to prevent trade among individuals.
What a politician says does not matter in reality. Present institutions and methods of thinking are *incompatible* with emerging technologies - and these technologies don't care one way or the other what anyone believes, says, or thinks; it is a paradigm shift.

Yes, similar to Open Transactions - a federation of independent operations communicating among each other. I believe the main difference being that OT is facilitating a bridge for traditional financial institutions to participate in the crypto environement.


Yes, very much the way [Git]( works.
There are scalability issues with the way hawala works for a computing platform, as there's no way to reliably ensure a path beyond a certain distance due to hardware variability. This leads to concentration of services such as the way the Internet backbone works, with supernodes that talk to other supernodes and handle traffic from local nodes.
Should that occur, those supernodes (the equivalent of major international banks) can then become information blackboxes. This is similar to the financial situation today. Without any way of verifying information held by a supernode, that supernode is free to change the entire system it has control of however it wants over time.
Assume Alice has a 100 unit credit with Bob, and their information is held at supernode X and Y, respectively. Unless alternative methods exist for Alice to verify her status from the supernodes, she is beholden to them - enslaved in a manner. No local service is likely to trust information from anywhere but the supernodes, as they are the authoritative sources.
With Ripple's record, it doesn't matter if a supernode refuses to disclose Alice's information. This way, the supernode can either issue or destroy a record, but cannot hide it. That same principle applies to every participant in the system; the real focus here is *accountability*, of which there is no longer any in the current system.
So long as there is a sufficient distribution of independent nodes, protocol changes would be limited. Extreme distortions might cause a fork.




A third purpose is to provide a universal web of trust. Without that accountability, there wouldn't be as great a need for Ripple, and the same threats of eventual centralization would arise more rapidly.
Bitcoin *could* fulfill those roles, but only within the Bitcoin system - realistically. Attacks against transaction dusting might be handled by throttling transactions without needing a transactional unit. Protection against manipulation of the accountability component absolutely requires a long-term record and some form of incurred expense for any modification.
No system is free from abuse, but it still has to be made as minimal as possible. A digital hawala would be a great thing, but Ripple offers something more than that: it's a universal replacement not just for currency exchanges, but credit rating agencies and major clearinghouses - it gives the smallest of participants the same capabilities and tools as the largest.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:04:57

Litecoin and Ripple are the only two alternatives worth paying attention to right now. Yes, LTC is simply a Bitcoin clone with a different hashing algorithm and faster block generation rate, but it is that similarity which makes it more viable than others. It allows for exchange to occur entirely within the cryptocurrency environment, rather than being exposed to the arguably greater risk of fiat.
Ripple has the potential to bridge *all* forms of wealth while creating a credit system that removes existing financial institutions from the equation. This is a complementary function to Bitcoin, and no less significant.
It isn't necessary to explain anything other than Bitcoin to new users, as it can stand by itself.

Great to see the continued rise in interest. Bitcoin *can* double in value every other week without collapsing - the only question is: for how long?
Market saturation would simply mean the value stops growing. We're nowhere near that point. Think of a bathtub being filled with water - there's lots of water splashing around until about a third of the tub is full. As long as there is no drain, the level keeps rising until it reaches the top.
Since Bitcoin's supply is limited, like the capacity of the tub, the supply can only be reduced in value by modifying demand, supply, or compromising integrity of the container. Realistically, the only two variables are demand and system integrity.
The same effect will occur with gold at some point in the near future. Fiat currency has sustained a failure in its container integrity, so the accumulated wealth must be stored elsewhere. Same principle, different structures.
Right now, Bitcoin and gold are in a race against each other - cryptocurrencies *will* win in the long-term, for various reasons, but gold will offer the traditional safe haven during this transitional period. Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it can overwhelm gold demand - awareness is the primary factor.

There is no "one true cryptocurrency" even though Bitcoin so far remains the one with the magic formula. The benefits the altcoins offer right now, especially Litecoin, include a safer trading destination than fiat currencies. Imagine taking profit on a Bitcoin high only to find that your dollar or euro side has been frozen. That's far less likely to happen with crypto-crypto trade because the exchanges have an incentive to facilitate ongoing movement.
This is similar to trading the gold-silver ratio. When doing this with physical metals, there is no shift into fiat and therefore greatly reduced counterparty risk.
Ripple in particular may be extremely beneficial by offering near-instantaneous confirmation on transactions.

Your question is dependent upon [perfect information]( being valid. GDP calculation is the essence of that: it is an attempt to gauge assets in relation to outstanding currency, which results in an approximation of currency value.
Extrapolate from that and you'll see that you need to take into account all areas touched by a currency to get a more complete picture. The only additional point would be to include velocity, as that can impact relative value and is an indication of usage level.
Aggregate all known (K) and unknown uses (U) of a currency, all intangible (I) and generally unquantifiable (Q) variables such as sentiment, then raise that to some dynamic variable related to velocity (V). Divide that by the total amount of currency in existence.
(K+U+I+Q)^V / C = total wealth share per unit of currency
To break things down to extreme simplicity, just total everything (E) that anyone would subjectively consider valuable and divide by number of units in currency (C) to arrive at the value (V).
E / C = V
Not complicated, but realistically impossible to determine the value for E.

From what I understand, the ripple network uses Ripple currency units denoted as XRP to provide a transfer fee of sorts. There is a fixed number of these units, 1x10^11 to be exact.
Each unit used is removed from the ledger, making the remaining units more valuable. As the unit supply decreases, transaction costs decline in terms of Ripples over time, slowing the elimination of those units. It's somewhat similar to [Zeno's dichotomy paradox](
Because XRP continually increase in value, it is to the benefit of validators to continue operating, as rising overall usage of the system contributes to their wealth accrual. At a certain point the market will become saturated and it won't be profitable to run a rippled node.
Contrast that to Bitcoin's incentive structure where there is eventually to be constant churn in terms of transaction fees for miners and, until all of the persistent units have been generated, block rewards.
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:05:02


What would an alternate solution be? It's a major departure from Bitcoin, and the way the currency units are structured, it won't be a good store of value system. It'll be an ideal means of exchange with near-instantaneous operation and no confirmation requirement prior to spending.
Relative to inflationary fiat, XRP should gain in value somewhat. I don't see them as direct competition for Bitcoin as savings because BTC value is infinitely *expandable*, while XRP value is infinitely *renewable*. Basically, the difference between an open-ended [cone]( and a closed [torus](

This argument does not hold water. It's a simple matter to filter out the attack vector; direct attacks won't be effective. BitTorrent has not been legislated out of existence, and Bitcoin is the equivalent for money.


Attacking one chain does not equate to attacking all of them. The amount of processing power must be duplicated for each chain. Only in the case of merged mining does this have any validity, but it is still impossible to do with different hash algorithms.


This is exactly what the Bitcoin protocol was designed to minimize. As stated earlier, it is relatively trivial to filter out attack vectors.


Banks and governments can be overcome. The effort necessary for them to succeed would be somewhat like trying to boil all the water in the Mediterranean Sea at once - absurd, and even it if could be done, self-destructive.

While there is a good amount of greed driving some Bitcoin speculation, the greater driver is likely fear - fear that traditional financial institutions will confiscate or somehow steal savings. Wealthy individuals are more inclined to *preserve* their wealth than those without much savings, whom are interested in *accumulating* more wealth. Therefore, large wealth holders will move their assets to wherever it is safest. Bitcoin is proving itself quite safe by comparison to theft from the very places money is supposed to be held sacrosanct.
Barring systemic compromise, the Bitcoin exchange rate is much more likely to continue rising than it is to fall. Not that there won't be corrections and dips, but overall the trend is higher.


In practice, this is effectively impossible. Using derivatives, banks essentially created new money, inflating the supply by several orders of magnitude over the last few decades.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be taken out of circulation; its value will simply decrease in proportion to the economic contraction. This is not the kind of catastrophic collapse we're witnessing in the current financial system, but a natural ebb and flow process.


Again, how would you solve the problem of double-spending? Bitcoin performs transaction validation/verification through mining, Ripple does it with a consensus model. However, there are trade-offs with each system.
Concentration has nothing to do with the usability of a currency. If 20,999,999 BTC were held in one address, the remaining ~1 BTC would still be able to provide the liquidity needed for the global economy thanks to the possibility of effectively infinite divisibility. Again, dumping such a concentration would reduce the value to a point making that extreme concentration pointless and its owner's former wealth worth nothing; counter-productive.
While avoiding excessive concentrations is *preferable*, it is not the penultimate consideration.

That's far less likely now than a catastrophic failure. The entire system is built upon a trust basis, and that foundation has been severely damaged. Because odd this, the monetary base will suddenly be much too great for resulting demands once the liquidity trap ends; with much of the world ditching the dollar, there will be a tidal wave of excess liquidity.


Not really. There is often concern over an economy "overheating" and contacting after a boom. It's prudent and demands foresight. What's ridiculous is expecting vested interests to manage the system equitably.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:50:02


That's reasonable, assuming an expandable money supply. It's the predictability that has invariably failed throughout history, and management is the concern that has always made inflation a problem. It's an issue that Bitcoin mitigates to a large degree.
Inflation is already occurring at the production level - input costs for real goods. There is a lot of interaction that is *not* captured by economic statistics, and because of that it's virtually impossible to see the cracks.
For instance: the [M2 measure]( is increasing while [velocity]( is decreasing. The response is to attempt forcing spending to occur when there is really a problem with the incentive structure of the existing monetary system - it has basically been reversed. Because of this, efforts that have worked in the past will fail.
Warnings of hyperinflation cannot pinpoint the threshold of reversal any more than traders can pick the exact top of an equity bubble. They *can* point out a legitimately detrimental situation. The magnitude of the issue is greater than anything seen before, making it immeasurably more dangerous.
The herd is an unthinking, reactionary form; its behavior at a certain scale does not change. Like an [action potential]( societies are predictable; once the signal has been triggered, it cannot be undone. We are past the tipping point - the only outcome is western hyperinflation.

True to a certain extent. The number of units in circulation is less important than overall adoption and usage.

How would you transition from the existing system without causing a catastrophic collapse? It was hard enough for the euro to replace existing national currencies.
You don't need to trust the early adopters. If they sell, that distributes units at a progressively decreasing exchange rate. Demand is more than sufficient to sustain prices approximately where they are now, and likely much higher. Do you trust holders of large amounts of dollars or euros? What about gold? Cars? Stamps?
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:39:59
There is a third component that must be evaluated: Metric (or Measure) of Value.
Bitcoin is good as all three, perhaps not today, but it will be once the volatility has subsided due to globally widespread adoption. With relatively stable prices, it will be a good MoV. There are limits to its effectiveness as a MoE due to the ~10 minute confirmation rate. The ideal purpose will likely be as a SoV due to Bitcoin's deflationary nature.
Coming from a different angle, Ripple ought to complement Bitcoin because it is an ideal MoE with near-instantaneous transaction propagation. It is *not* an ideal SoV, as what goes in is what comes out, unlike Bitcoin where savings continue to appreciate. Both may act as MoV with Ripple functioning more as the transactional system and Bitcoin being a settlement currency - the former for day-to-day exchanges, the latter used when dealing with large sums.
There are variations, but that's the gist of the trend so far as I see it.

@_date: 2013-03-10 21:37:18
A major difference is that Bitcoin uses an active verification model, while Ripple has a passive mechanism. This allows for near-instantaneous transactions that don't need to wait for ~10 minutes to be spendable.
The unit design of XRP also differs from BTC in that Bitcoin's supply *expands* indefinitely; Ripple's supply *renews* indefinitely. That affords very different dynamics for incentives and use cases.
The planned 'smart property' in Bitcoin has somewhat of an analog in the Ripple system as a whole, but the vulnerabilities found in one system are largely mitigated by the other. Scalability is also approached from a different angle. These are not trivial variations as seen with Litecoin.

Yes, basically. That's a very simple approach, though. It would be like saying Bitcoin is only worth what it can buy right now, which would make the exchange rate worth much less than it is currently.

One of the author's statements was absurd, indicative of momentary thought instead of analysing the process past the point of adoption:


Really? Bitcoin is in a growth phase at the moment, so of course the value is volatile - mostly to the upside. If it becomes widespread enough to be used predominantly in the global economy, the value *will not* double over the course of a week. As an economy grows, a static supply currency will rise in value proportionately - what economy doubles in a week? None.
Bitcoin will continue to defy critics and "economists" because of rampant linear thinking. There is much more to the system than what exists right now, but that will only become apparent to most over time.

I do agree that the OP title is on the sensational side, and that it's improbable Bitcoin would ever replace all forms of fiat currency, but it doesn't need to do so; it only needs to remain a better option than current ones to naturally garner a reserve function. This may approach a significant portion of global wealth, much like gold.
If Ripple gains traction as a credit and clearing-house platform, it is more likely to provide a foundation for the remaining wealth base which could be composed of anything from regional currencies to precious metals to equities and derivatives. Such a system would be similar to the fiat regimes that exist now, but running within a universal protocol that cannot be unilaterally changed at the whim of a banker or politician.


In doing so, it is destroying the monetary foundation it rests upon. This has the effect of reducing external demand while internal demand rises (a critical distinction comparable to cannibalism). With the addition of wealth destruction occurring simultaneously, there is strong *dis*incentive to participate in the traditional financial system. A business that poisons its customers results in abandonment, and the same applies to governments and their citizens (especially via monetary systems).

It wouldn't. Governments are not all-powerful, or murder would be unknown and BitTorrent wouldn't exist. Decentralized cryptocurrencies simply outclass fiat, so no matter how much firepower is behind the latter, the former cannot be overwhelmed as long as that circumstance remains.
Much of this argument assuming government can destroy distributed technologies is amusing. US-centric views seem to think [prostitution]( is illegal everywhere as well. There is also the matter [decriminalization or legalization]( of certain drugs.

The supply may not be explicitly capped, but the resources necessary to extract gold are increasing geometrically. Ore is less concentrated, termed 'lower grade' in the mining industry. It is also generally deeper, therefore harder to access. It's a situation similar to oil extraction - the easy reserves have been all but exhausted. Return on energy used is becoming razor-thin.
Still, gold and fiat are not equivalent; a greater disruption to gold would be something like asteroid mining. The topic is discussed further, along with the reasoning, in [this post](

Fundamentally, the basis is conceptually the same - Litecoin swaps out the SHA256 hashing algorithm used in Bitcoin for Scrypt, which has a different trade-off in terms of computing requirements (processing speed vs. memory usage).
AFAIK, the only other change is faster block creation rate. Instead of Bitcoin at 10 minutes, the Litecoin network generates a new block every 2.5 minutes.
As an empirical proof-of-concept, Litecoin is great. It shows that different algorithms and rates of transaction validation do work as expected. And it provides a realm for GPU mining to remain productive - an interesting dynamic of its own.
I think Litecoin actually *benefits* from being similar to Bitcoin in that the strength in reputation formed from the latter is largely applicable to the former. Ripple has hit headwinds from even the Bitcoin community because of how strange it seems, reflecting the kind of initial wariness seen in the gold investor community toward Bitcoin. Because Litecoin has only functionally swappable aspects changed, it works as Bitcoin users expect.
This will also provide a wealth pool that can handle "spillover" from Bitcoin - formation of a bubble in Bitcoin may begin to leak over to Litecoin instead of flowing back into fiat. There is a lot of risk involved with fiat as well, including frozen funds and periods of rapid depreciation due to uncontrollable elements. In that sense, remaining entirely within the cryptocurrency environment could be viewed as safer than trading out.
If you are familiar with the gold-silver ratio, trading BTC/LTC would be the equivalent of trading gold for silver and vice versa.
While Litecoin may eventually fade, it has a definable purpose for at least the near future, so I don't see it going away soon. Aside from Ripple, other alt-currencies simply haven't hit a viable formula.

Following government sponsored statistics, we're supposed to believe inflation is only a few percent per year. According to shadowstats.com much of the western world is exceeding 10% - couple that with recent real estate momentum and a compounding effect occurs with prices, even as business activity is failing. That accelerates price increases.
Real estate management generally takes into account annual changes, so projecting for the next year would show a need to increase rates or risk loss, if not bankruptcy. This would be similar to having to increase your salary in order to keep up with bills. The dominant root cause of price rises is no longer demand, but monetary mismanagement.

Good presentation overall, but becomes a marketing tool for certain alt-coins at the end, suggesting that they are better than Bitcoin while being anything but an objective assessment.
Demurrage, such as with Freicoin, is *not* necessary with cryptocurrencies, as it is a method that attempts to compensate for human central management risk. Litecoin is *not* an improvement over Bitcoin - it is an *alternative* that makes use of the same framework, but with different functional components.
Ripple also completely obviates the issue of demurrage; the unit supply of XRP is continuously replenished on a relative basis instead of absolute - a method far superior to demurrage, and not feasible prior to the advent of cryptocurrencies.

The transcription appears to have been automatically generated, making the reading less than clear. There's no problem with the incentive structure, but it can't directly affect external factors.
Sending a few Satoshi to each full node connected at the time a block is generated would create an incentive for wider distribution of Bitcoin nodes and block propagation. Competing mining pools would be a little different, but only if a pool were able to reliably generate 2+ blocks sequentially. It's a variation on the 51% attack that might not require that amount of processing power to selectively target high mining fee blocks. However, it still runs the risk of revenue loss due to creating an orphaned block - essentially the same as variance.
tl;dr - potential attempt at gaming the protocol which is still vulnerable to variance; i.e. everything balances out in the end unless 51% sustained.

@_date: 2013-06-11 02:40:21
Thanks, and I appreciate the questions. Your first point involves two main trends that I see converging.
Consider the cost of a full GPU system. All of the components could easily run up over $500 for a single-GPU system that will consume several hundred watts, require extensive configuration, maintenance, and is unlikely to ever break even. A USB ASIC miner is *relatively* inexpensive for both the hardware and power input cost.
Next, many ASICs just have to be plugged in via USB and pointed to a mining pool, or configured over the network like a common home router. That isn't quite brain-dead simple, but it's moving in that direction. What may be next is integration of 32GB+ flash storage that will run a miner and blockchain-pruning Bitcoin daemon. The only thing necessary then would be to specify the receiving address.
There are indeed some groups paying others to engage in wizardry, one of the ways being investment in ASICMINER. However, most big money is still more focused on traditional forms of money (gold, currencies, etc).
With the Bitcoin price the key is market saturation. Current ASICs are insanely profitable, but the more there are, the less that will be. The input costs, including both initial hardware purchase and power usage, will be higher relative to the return.
For example: a 1 Gh/s miner may be making 90% profit at 5 watts now, but in six months might only making 10% profit. Either newer devices will have to be deployed to get back up toward 90% or the price of Bitcoin will have to rise. If new hardware is deployed, it will eventually suffer the same fate as the prior generation. Then the only thing that can give is the exchange rate, as production cost will have increased; the price per BTC goes up.
A similar dynamic played out with the shift from CPU to GPU mining, also accelerated by increased participation. Fascinating to observe.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:58:15

Using the calculations in the post, 100mm txs per day and ~1KB per tx:
    100,000,000 * 1,024 = 102,400,000,000
Or approximately 95GB, round up to 96GB to be conservative. That's daily. Now let's break it down to a more immediate rate:
    96GB / 24h = 4GB/h
Going further, assuming 6 blocks per hour for a rate every 10 minutes:
    4GB / 6 = 0.667GB
That's barely a full CD and is looking quite manageable for a [reasonably fast residential Internet connection]( in most regions. Now let's break it down to each second, being even more conservative by estimating based off of a 680MB CD capacity and dividing by the 600 seconds occuring in a 10 minute period:
    680MB / 600s = ~1.13MB/s or ~9Mb/s
This is easily attainable today at the mid to low end of the bandwidth spectrum with current infrastructure in modern regions. Even less developed areas can handle this rate.
The issue of propagation across the entire network is more of an issue, as that can multiply the distribution effort. However, there are solutions to that as well.
With well-connected nodes and full 100-1000Mb connections, the Bitcoin network should be able to scale fairly readily. Mining pools already offer much of the structure necessary.
Full client nodes may be mildly prohibitive for modern residential use at that scale, but we're about 700 times less than that right now. In another year or two, that shouldn't be an issue. At current growth rates, that gap may be closed before the decade is out.

The network effect and coincidence of wants provide ample explanation for why that would not work as you expect.
Bitcoin has exceeded a threshold where no new similar alternative could independently achieve *sustainable* momentum. Litecoin is only able to continue in strength because it is an outlet for the existing pool of GPU miners. Other than that, there is little incentive for a *critical mass* of infrastructure support to move in favor of any other - momentary highlights are virtually guaranteed to fade away or settle into niche uses. For all general intents and purposes, Bitcoin *is* the encompassing cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2013-02-27 20:22:57


Release of the server source is the critical point now. If the source does provide an implementation of the Ripple concept, it wouldn't matter that OpenCoin holds a large amount of the initial XRP supply.
If OpenCoin *doesn't* distribute to a large number of users, the system won't gain traction. If OpenCoin *does* distribute widely enough, then it won't have control over the network.
It will be some time before XRP are worth much of anything in terms of market valuation anyway - trying to dump their holdings right now wouldn't net the ~USD$30mm price for all 100 billion units because buyers would drop or pull bids. By the time it would be a worthwhile long-con, the system will have taken on a life of its own (assuming the implementation matches the concept).

Not better, [different](
There are three main purposes of money:
* A means of exchange - satisfying the [coincidence of wants]( allowing two people with different desires to trade with a common medium
* A metric of value (MoV) - other items are measured in relation to money, which acts like a ruler
* A store of value (SoV) - money acts as a form of holding onto wealth for extended periods of time, to be used at a later date; ideally, the value will appreciate somewhat over time
Ripple's XRP currency can be thought of as forming a [torus]( the supply continuously renewed. This means that it works well as a MoE and MoV, but not as well when used as a SoV. Bitcoin can act as all three, but performs especially well as a SoV because the limited supply rises in value in relation to economic productivity. Compard to Ripple's torus, Bitcoin might be seen as resembling a cone with continuously expanding value thanks to effectively infinite divisibility.
Gold advocates have often suggested saving in gold and spending in dollars (or euros, or whatever local fiat exists). Similarly, Bitcoin may eventually come to be used for saving, with Ripple primarily used for spending. Ripple does not make use of mining the same way as Bitcoin, but the differences only work better for certain activities.
Consider that banks essentially do the same thing as Bitcoin mining - they just do it in a centralized manner. Transaction verification is the result in both cases. Mining allows for control to be removed from existing institutions. Eventually, there may be consolidation and a threat to the Bitcoin system due to re-centralization, but the banking industry in the 1800s was not very centralized - history echoes. It's a pattern of cycles, but this is a major shift toward something much grander than just a form of money.

There was some discussion on this topic a while back. I suggested that sufficiently large mining operations might pay out a small percentage of each block to nodes that were online at the time of solving. It would probably amount to a few hundred Satoshis per full node at the moment, but it would be another way to accrue a balance while further distributing the network.
Note that this wouldn't require a change to the protocol. Multi-sig scripts could handle these donations. An automated sweeping tool could redeem any outstanding balance based off of criteria such as IP or other signatures.

There certainly are powerful interests that want to hold the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. However, secure systems are exactly what provide a foundation that removes the power base held by those interests.
The physical structure of the Internet is changing to one far more diversified and less reliant upon those managing the pipes.

That assumes we'll remain in our physical existence. What comes after is *how* we'll live longer and safer. It's increasingly likely that fully virtual existence will be possible, much like that depicted in the Matrix, but without a body.
The physical assets necessary to support abstract realms without scarcity should be reasonable, so there will still be scarcity in a physical sense. However, from an internal perspective one would only have to think about what's desired to create it; living longer and safer would be foreign terms.

By this, I assume you are referring to the SHA256 chain forking. A fork of that chain would lead to destabilization, during which a scrypt chain would be in high demand.

A shame the title is misleading. Coming from Dan Kaminsky, there's a lot of rational thought. Only a few points highlight some potential variation of opinion.


Bitcoin's progress is a *process*, not a momentary situation. Right now, the optimal use is transactional; over time, volatility will reduce and the primary use is likely to shift to settlement (storage held for large transactions).


Instead of a vertical form of pressure relief, Bitcoin has a *lateral* type: alt-chains such as Litecoin and Ripple. Excess wealth can spillover from Bitcoin to other systems; the alternatives will have to offer similar benefits and interoperability with Bitcoin to partake, largely removing contemporary national currencies. The reverse would hold if an alternative were to provide a significantly superior system; Bitcoin would have to fit into that environment.


Dedicated hardware actually makes it easier for anyone to participate. As long as the hardware does not require an exorbitant amount of wealth to acquire an atomic unit capable of participating in the system the same way the institutional ones do, the environment is not locked out. Thousands of users obtaining inexpensive hardware, or even the possibility of mining chips being installed in consumer devices, reduces the threat of overwhelming central mining dominance.
It is similar to being able to pick gold bits out of a stream while there is a major mining company a short distance away doing the same on a larger scale. If individuals could purchase a piece of hardware capable of paying for the monthly power bill, or enabling a discount from any manner of desirable business, a market will arise.


"Fixed" is a relative term. Using scrypt makes a system more vulnerable to botnets, and there's nothing to preclude dedicated solutions - it's just *much* more difficult.


This is what Ripple is doing. The concern about single points of currency translation relates more to Open Transactions. Regardless, there are trade-offs with both of those approaches.


Yes, over time. It's also important to reflect on an earlier part of what Dan says:




The Internet itself is straining under regulatory excess and other factors. It is in the process of reinventing itself, or transitioning to another form if you prefer that perspective, making most of the existing regulation ineffective.

Yes, which may externally slow system growth, but not necessarily wealth accumulation. This would provide time for implementation of pruning and other features which should allow for greater scalability. Bitcoin has greater potential as a *settlement* currency than a transactional one, which is where Ripple is set to shine.
Most alts pull a majority of their improvements from Bitcoin. As such, it will take time for any to catch up, let alone surpass. Meanwhile, Bitcoin will continue to be improved as well. There's no *realistic* possibility of Litecoin or any other alt truly comparing to Bitcoin's dominance in the immediate future. The landscape may indeed be different a year from now, though.

What's proposed is nice. However, feel-good does not equate to reality. Ripple is distributing the XRP currency units, but over time the distribution will favor those best at accumulating regardless of when the first round was obtained.

Do laws stop drug use or money laundering? Did arbitrary prohibition eradicate alcohol consumption?
If a speed limit is 100kph, and every driver is going 200kph, there's no way to stop all of them. If it's also difficult to directly identify the drivers (no license, vehicle unregistered, etc), the difficulty is magnified. The choice of the majority cannot be denied - only resisted for a limited time.
Assuming the source is released, *any individual* may act as an exchange. Even if an exchange is halted or shut down for a period of time, there is still a record of the balance in the Ripple system - unlike any other exchange where the records are held in a central location. That balance cannot be confiscated without voluntary compliance, or a great deal of effort, making non-compliance easier than giving up when a significant amount of wealth begins moving into the system.
All Ripple needs is a critical mass, the same as Bitcoin and every other disruptive technology. I believe it will achieve that critical mass no matter what anyone thinks - the benefits far outweigh the excessive importance placed on central distribution of XRP.

Without a transition process, an economy would grind to a halt the way a car engine seizes up without lubricating oil.
There is now more than sufficient internal momentum within the Bitcoin system that no major party could crash the entire network; it is no longer capable of being a Ponzi. Even if a large holder dumped 100,000 BTC, there is enough demand to absorb the selling.


This is accurate, and it will occur with *any* form of money whether distributed centrally or through an incentive structure.


After Cyprus, enormous holdings of wealth are seeking safer alternatives to traditional financial instruments, especially fiat currencies. This is part of the transition, and involves wealth-preservation items such as gold and other precious metals, real estate, gemstones, artwork, collectibles and things such as classic cars, etc. Bitcoin is a small enough economy that $2 billion is a drop in the bucket next to the trillions in wealth that exist.
Consider that gold is a *much* larger market. It will still rise by perhaps a factor of 10. Bitcoin is tiny by comparison, and may rise by a factor of 1,000 or greater as wealth pours in from various sources.


Exactly. Voluntary participation dilutes the effect of concentration. In addition, any new technology attracts savvy participants at first - they are generally more capable of navigating the pitfalls associated with potential downsides. In this case, many involved with cryptocurrencies will be able to gain a greater share of the whole, possibly from the concentrated holdings.
Regardless, a major holder destabilizing the Bitcoin system would simply be self-destructive for that holder. It is not a case of leaving Bitcoin for something else; Bitcoin *is* the something else right now.

Bitcoin's supply is infinitely *expandable*; Ripple's supply is infinitely *renewable*. XRP will gain some measure of value during growth of the system, but the available stock to needed flow will prevent it from gaining the way Bitcoin has. See [this thread]( for further explanation.
I'll use Satoshi Dice as an example. Recently, Erik Vorhees introduced a large sell in the form of five million shares. The first two million were scooped up almost instantly, but the third sat for a while. This had the effect of steadying the share price.
The above scenario is similar to what would happen with Ripple. However, there is an effectively unlimited supply that continuously scales to available stock. That means the transaction fee, which could be a fraction of a XRP, should be dynamically adjusted. I don't know yet whether that adjustment is based on volume or some other factor.
There are three functions of money:
* Means of exchange (MoE)
* Metric of value (MoV)
* Store of value (SoV)
Bitcoin can act as all three, but ideally works as a MoV and SoV due to the ~10+ minute transaction confirmation time. Ripple could also act as all three, but would be a *static* SoV - value you put in should come back out approximately the same, whereas Bitcoin would pretty consistently *increase* in value.
With virtually instantaneous transaction confirmation, Ripple would act as an ideal MoE, and eventually a very good MoV. I say eventually because it will take some time before Ripple is used widely enough for the exchange rate to stabilize at a high degree.
A reason for withholding supply would be to counteract potential bubbles like the one Bitcoin experienced in 2011. XRP might be seen as a savings vehicle even though it is poorly suited as such. With no sellers, the exchange rate could rise sharply and collapse, but without the savings incentive, it would have a harder time recovering than Bitcoin has - such a collapse would potentially be fatal to the system.
Edit: fixed formatting.
Edit: [Joel has made a post]( regarding why OpenCoin has not released the source; this mirrors reasoning for the 2011 bubble decline being good for Bitcoin, as it would require fewer participants to adopt major updates fixing possible protocol vulnerabilities.

Under what definition would loss of value without accelerating unit supply increase be hyperinflation? For all the argument Mish has made *against* hyperinflation occurring, this is a complete disconnect.

The longer distribution takes, the more potential for disruption of trust. It's a risk that must be managed for any business.
Staged releases might help, but subsequent market value might make a mess out of it. If the first million are distributed at a certain value, and the second million are distributed at a higher value, the earlier recipients might be upset. Likewise, vice versa - later recipients receiving cheaper units may feel short-changed.
Then the blame game ensues, blame the earlier recipients for whatever criteria they matched that allowed them to get in early; blame the central organization for failing to distribute fairly; blame the latecomers for being late... it's a slippery slope.

Disincentives to use of traditional systems have grown so noticeable that more and more people are seeking alternatives, with many actively doing so. Upon discovering optimal solutions they share that knowledge - Bitcoin spreads in a viral manner.
Since the system is purely abstract and the majority of potential users already have the tools (mobile phone, Internet connectivity, etc) to participate, the barriers to entry are almost exclusively awareness and intuitive interfaces. As awareness increases, there will be a good amount of new tech-savvy users joining. Ease of use is approaching a point where today's retiree can grasp the process.
When awareness is at a point where about 10-15% of people have at least *heard* of Bitcoin, and the user experience is as straightforward and simple as browsing websites, adoption will accelerate at a very rapid pace. The world may then see Bitcoin go from a few million users to 80% global usage within just a few years - regardless of legal status.

All valid points and concerns. Only two counterpoints:

* Napster gave way to BitTorrent in much the same way that forms of money like Beenz were predecessors to Bitcoin.
* Megaupload dominated the file locker arena, and had to reinvent itself; this is a likely path for Bitcoin - continuous reinvention.
* Intrade has been castrated. Betsofbitco.in and the like are unencumbered by short-sighted regulation thanks to their use of Bitcoin.
Yes, Litecoin is a potentially solid competitor. It is unlikely to supersede Bitcoin, though. Mostly because it is based off of the same principles, operating almost exactly the way Bitcoin does, only with a few functional components swapped. Ripple is another, one that functions in a *much* different way - it is a credit system, whereas Bitcoin is effectively a hard money system.
Bitcoin has numerous other pieces of functionality which simply have not yet been unlocked. Progress will continue steadily toward things like smart property, m-of-n transactions, etc. They cannot be implemented overnight because anything that would affect the stability of the system could be catastrophic. Alternatives might include them sooner, but would probably act mostly as test beds, or interoperate with the Bitcoin economy rather than overwhelm it; there's always a barrier to usage until the tools are simple enough for a critical mass to adopt.
In addition to the considerations above, any new system will require a fairly lengthy period of continuous operation to prove resilience, *and* there would have to be circumstances surrounding Bitcoin which would make it undesirable by comparison. Otherwise, it simply won't attract that critical mass.
People can endure a lot of abuse (theft of wealth through inflation, rising taxation, etc) before they finally do anything about it. Passive incentives (near-zero fee, near-instantaneous transactions) are very difficult to overcome. It's the situation of having something that didn't exist before and wondering how life was bearable before having it.

Not at all - nothing goes in a straight line. This is most definitely a buying opportunity.


The Fed, and every other major financial institution (ECB, JPM, GS, etc), is insolvent. There are only two ways to decrease the money supply at this point:
* Remove funds from the Fed and major banks, which would cause an instant financial holocaust
* Confiscate funds not owned by the Fed and major banks, which would cause riots and possibly war
As [Jim Sinclair]( has stated: there is no *practical* solution.


Bitcoin would not inflate, as the supply will be static, but you're on the right track - the value would decrease *relative* to goods and services because there are fewer of them available. During growth, putting more economic productivity into a store of wealth (gold, Bitcoin, etc) without expanding the supply of the container, increases the density of wealth present: i.e. the value rises.
When economic activity contracts, that density of wealth decreases, resulting in lower value. This can be seen at the consumer level with purchasing power variability, a notably example being the [Big Mac index](
You could think of Bitcoin becoming more valuable during growth because it becomes more rare, while goods and services (anything that can be bought) become more valuable during contraction because *they* become more rare.


Admitting you don't know is the first step :)
There are currently a few methods:
* Bitcoin and almost all other existing cryptocurrencies use [proof-of-work](
* PPCoin implements a hybrid proof-of-work and [proof-of-stake]( system
* A method not yet in operation as of yet is [Network Assured Contracts](
* Then there is Ripple's approach of [consensus](
Each method has its own strengths and vulnerabilities. There are potential paths that could combine several of them and lead to a cohesive system, or each could remain independent and interoperate with others. This would form overlapping networks of sorts that protect each others' weaknesses.


You're right, there *is* a level of extreme concentration that can start to have a detrimental effect. This is where the cryptocurrency environment comes into play, meaning multiple networks can be jumped to should one prove to become an undesirable mess. Litecoin, PPCoin, Ripple, and any other that build enough momentum to maintain will provide escape routes should anything happen to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is being distributed according to a hands-off incentive structure. Ripple is being distributed the way you proposed in your initial post. While the latter may be less prone to high volatility, it's very unlikely that it would've been able to get very far without riding Bitcoin's success; the first Ripple project attained only a few thousand user adoption. The time is right for cryptocurrencies in general - we just have to sort through and see which ones become best-of-breed.

So you're suggesting Ripple only needs to exist until a federated banking system arises, which is what exists today. How does that enforce a common clearinghouse that is not subject to abusive cartel activity?


Erasing history is a good thing now? That allows the entities controlling infrastructure overwhelming power to dictate asset ownership, risking account freezing and seizure.


A decentralized ledger system allows for minimal, if not zero trust. The problem is in *protecting* that ledger from destructive and manipulative attacks. One of these issues is dust/spam attacks, which have already been shown to occur; without addressing that problem, no system will be sustainable.
Email providers have resorted to throttling and extensive trust-based verfication. That's fine for those systems, but with Bitcoin and Ripple, such an approach severely hampers automation, reliability and scalability.

Independent, machine-initiated transactions should balloon transaction volume, probably orders of magnitude higher than current peak tps rates. There are capabilities that will become available through Bitcoin; what it *enables* will also sustain it.
As for transaction volume, the Bitcoin network is artificially limited at the moment to 7 transactions per second. If that limit is reached, there would be 4,200 transactions for every 10-minute block. A transaction fee imposed on each of those would result in 0.0059 XBT to match the current 25 XBT reward subsidy. That would happen with the network increasing by about a factor of 14 from its present state, which isn't much for a system an so much room for growth.
With regard to exchange value, at $150/XBT tx fees would still be less than 1c. With a subsidy of 6.25 after two more halvings, and 1,000 tps, a fee on all txs would end up being 0.00001 XBT. That would allow the exchange rate to be in excess of $15,000/XBT.
Mining operations that are unable to maintain profitability at that level will simply fail. Energy consumption of the total mining factor will self-moderate based on these variables, as there should always be *some* measure of value available for mining operations.

The suggestion of one pool distributing the reward to others is great. Mining pools can [pay out a small amount to full nodes]( creating an incentive for rapid block propagation.

Not necessarily. Growth pressure can be relieved a few ways, one of which is off-blockchain order-matching at exchanges. Another is by a rising exchange rate, psychologically pricing it out of range for most. Through this process, Bitcoin may trend toward acting as a settlement currency for high net wealth entities.
The above would slow transaction volume growth, allowing development to accommodate for increases more gradually.

In isolation, Esperanto may provide a linguistic and social behavior study. It's a similar situation with Bitcoin on its own, although perhaps for a wider range of related topics.
Your first point validly shows the divergence in difficulty barriers, with Bitcoin indeed being very simple by comparison. There does have to be a critical mass of usage for both Bitcoin and Esperanto, but the first point renders the second largely inconsequential.
With disparate spoken languages, vocabularies form a many-to-one relationship ('chair' is a different term in French, Russian, and Chinese). Bitcoin is arriving from the opposite direction, being one item or thing that can be associated from any angle. In addition, there are isomorphisms with other recognizable elements in any language (think of the term 'wallet') that make for easy integration. In other words, a Bitcoin wallet is *functionally* similar without requiring the term be changed for any particular culture.
The same happened with computers and the Internet, which are now universally understood terms. Esperanto's battle is against a critical mass, much like any new cryptocoin struggles against Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Namecoin. I see it simply as widespread/universal communication enabling convergent association precluding independent discovery and naming that require long periods of time to become established.

Only when active network hashing capacity exceeds miner efficiency and the rate at which hardware is replaced. When the dynamic balances out, price will remain stable even as difficulty rises.
Right now, and for another 1-2 hardware generations, the dynamic is imbalanced. Since hardware development is limited by physics, the softest factor is price; unless a significant source of supply floods markets, it will rise.

This may be trending toward semantic differences, but how do you write a law that changes the English language? Sure, you can proclaim that profanity is prohibited (try saying that 3x fast), but that doesn't remove the words from awareness.
Which leads to the second point: increasing adoption in the face of prohibition. Although it may seem absurd and groundless, this has been discussed elsewhere in relation to the [Streisand effect]( Indeed, this is how some were [introduced to Bitcoin](
The first step is awareness; then, as people come to understand the benefits of decentralized cryptocurrencies over traditional banking, there is no amount of legislation that can stop people from pursuing what they desire. BitTorrent is simply a better way of distributing content, and the furor created by the media industry arguably helped to propel its usage to a wider audience despite legislative penalties.

This is a gross misunderstanding of how cryptocurrencies work.
The fork in March affected Bitcoin *only*. A 51% attack would affect only the hashing method targeted; the same hardware could only be used on Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm *or* Litecoin's scrypt.
Ripple is *entirely* different, making use of a consensus propagation model to secure transactions instead of proof-of-work. In addition, there are other alt-chains that implement proof-of-*stake* systems, which would likewise be unaffected by a Bitcoin-directed attack.
The only thing that affects all at the same time is legislation related to the entire class, and that is impotent regarding the technical operation of any decentralized cryptocurrency.
Where wealth flows has everything to do with where it can be utilized in a secure manner. There have been no legitimately successful weaknesses found so far with any of the alt-chains, and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has a very long way to go. What you may think is worthless is actually highly valuable to anyone wanting to hedge against Bitcoin failure, yet having confidence in the underlying concept and fearing traditional financial instruments.

Essentially, yes. I have seen a handful of businesses accepting LTC, but nowhere near enough to form a supporting infrastructure. It is almost entirely speculative for now.
There *is* energy/work value entering the system, so there's something to be said for the system. As far as currency flows, Litecoin can actually stabilize Bitcoin fluctuations.

To go further, there's the question of *how* to obtain the information, its reliability and timeliness, and so on.

The longer it takes to accumulate data, the less relevant it will be.

In addition, once a government starts to use an alternative currency, a dependency forms. The larger the dependency, the greater the likelihood that demand increases.

Agreed - the issues with Novacoin are unnerving. At the same time, there are numerous projects that grow beyond the originator's oversight. Litecoin has certainly taken on a life of its own, so time will tell for others.
What I'd really like to see is a modular plugin framework for cryptocurrencies in general.

Consider a closed, embedded platform where an algorithm like MD5 might still be workable - a controlled environment which could make use of an organic information propagation system...

Basically the same description as exists on the Ripple site, but a little different. It may be more clear for some people.

I believe that part of this is because wealth can just as easily flow *through* Bitcoin as well as *into*. By acquiring bitcoins with fiat in the amount intended to make a purchase with, there is no real "loss" incurred, especially when the exchange rate is likely to move favorably for holding BTC.
Imagine withdrawing $100 or €100 from a bank for a purchase of the same amount, and finding that instead of spending it all, you have 10% left over - which keeps appreciating...

According to the Wikipedia entry, global money supply doubled during the 1990 to 2002 period, 12 years. The next doubling of currency in circulation took 6 years, from 2002 to 2008.
Considering the events of recent years, it's reasonable to expect that supply doubled again within the 3 year span from 2008-2011. That would put the worldwide amount at $8 trillion. In addition, continued systemic stress will likely push that to double in progressively shorter time frames. If this holds, then by mid-2013, there will be $16 trillion. A single bitcoin at 1% market share might rise above $10,000 in that situation.

The title is provocative, but the mechanism by which inflation will be stopped is not a direct action - Bitcoin will neither shoot Bernanke down, nor support him. It'll be the existing system that destroys itself. Just the existence of an alternative is enough for that to happen.
If the dollar, or any other fiat currency, were a viable mechanism for trade and wealth storage, Bitcoin would be another currency option. However, that would require banks to be responsible, governments to be transparent, and participant confidence to remain unshaken.
The greatest insult is to be [ignored]( That's what the world is starting to do to the dollar, and the traditional financial system in general. Bitcoin is doing its thing, regardless of whether fiat exists or not - no active effort against Bernanke required to make dollar inflation irrelevant. That's more powerful than any direct attack.

No, quantity is not the only measure of value.
The value can only be estimated, at best. Local dislocations in valuation can have major effects on valuation, and there are numerous other factors to be considered.
In order to ascertain approximate value, a wide range of information would need to be accumulated: how much the currency is used, where, what goods and services are exchanged, how often, etc. The list is extensive, and shows the central approach.
Alternatively, a market value is arrived at collaboratively. Market participants, both direct and indirect, influence and determine value. This is essentially done autonomously, and is far better able to account for and respond to localized fluctuations than a centralized method.

The attractiveness is inherent to what the Bitcoin system provides. If it becomes a felony to use bitcoins, there's no way to effectively police the entire populace. Instead, the perennial tactic is to have people report on each other. This means that they must somehow be aware of the fact that Bitcoin is prohibited. When people are informed of something they're unfamiliar with, curiosity takes over and information spreads.
Even if the population is not informed directly, we live in a hyper-connected world where [information spreads nearly instantaneously]( Should a prominent member of the Bitcoin community be targeted for a smear campaign, perhaps  fraudulently accused of murder, the aspect of involvement with Bitcoin would become a news point. This would further spread awareness of Bitcoin.
Not only this, but if men in caves become the reason that the US tries to legislate away Bitcoin, there are plenty of regions which will not. In fact, they may view Bitcoin as a tool or weapon to protect or use against their perceived tyranny wrought by the US. None of this matters, as Bitcoin is becoming "[Internet money](
In effect, there is literally *nothing* that can be done to stop the spread of Bitcoin. So long as there is a demand for alternatives to government fiat and contemporary banking institutions, it can only be slowed down. Demand overrode such things as [US alcohol prohibition]( and the [Berlin Wall]( It is now leaving established powers incompatible with a changing world.

Ripple may allow transactions to occur near instantaneously, but waiting for final settlement seems to be something that Bitcoin could short-circuit.

That's the point - the definition of commodity may need to be expanded, replaced, or bridged to include abstract concepts made tangible (in a sense) through cryptography - kind of like describing a different form of matter. Other definitions may need to be reassessed for validity in relation to cryptocurrencies  as well.
I see the RT as a means for discerning a practical origination of an existing monetary item, and a way to explain the subsequent usage of it as such. In that capacity, it has to use agreed-upon definitions as a starting point for itself. Other than that, it remains valid as a conceptual framework.

As pointed out by others, Bitcoin relies on gateways for exchange among other currencies. It can be somewhat difficult to set up an exchange, considering all the regulation hoops to jump through. Ripple offers the possibility that anyone can fulfill the function of an exchange, distributing the gateways much more broadly than currently possible.
Ripple is currently more centralized than Bitcoin, as it was just released. However, as adoption of the system grows, it should become as decentralized as Bitcoin - not really more or less than, but in a similar way. Think of it as comparing apples to oranges - you can't really do that, but you can classify them both as fruit.

This may be a very good idea, actually. Not by implementing it in the Bitcoin protocol or client, though.
The compensation structure would best be determined by active miners, as in a multi-address transaction being sent - like a donation from miners to active nodes. With that incentive, I imagine there would be an uptake in full nodes available.
If the donation were 1 Satoshi per full node at 10mm nodes, there would be 10,000,000 Satoshis per block, or 1 BTC in donations. Currently, there are less than 10k active nodes, although Blockchain.info shows as many as [1.6mm total]( nodes seen.

That's only one metric by which to gauge severity.


There is no losing money unless a wallet is stolen. Money in the traditional financial system has no such protections - it can either be confiscated directly from bank accounts, or inflated into worthlessness. Even gold is limited by its physical presence, being subject to theft as well.
Being a small market, Bitcoin valuation relative to the existing system fluctuates significantly. As it grows, the volaility will greatly decrease, until the situation is reversed and the fiat system has wild price swings while Bitcoin is stable.

It isn't that different. Discussing Bitcoin takes time; getting businesses to adopt it costs money; participating in the Bitcoin network requires some form of hardware, especially if mining. Some in the Bitcoin community have invested a lot of money and have an incentive to run large-scale mining operations. The incentives are similar to Bitcoin's, just from a different angle.
It doesn't cost much at all to run a validation node - no more than running bitcoind. In fact, much less because there's no proof-of-work calculation required by default. That's the difference - no *active* mining is required; it's all a passive process which comes to life only when transactions are seen on the network.
The distributed ripple network *can* operate without gateways, but it affords their direct participation without compromising the P2P nature of the system. This is what Bitcoin advocates have been looking for, although there are still limitations.
One concern is initial distribution - Bitcoin facilitates this by user competition. Ripple is doing so through a central source. Also, a whitepaper would help immensely - the Wiki isn't as clear as it could be; too much emphasis is placed on the P2P lending aspect without exploring how to get there from where the system is now.

Certainly possible. I don't think the likelihood of that is particularly high, though. Being truly global, bitcoins can be sold or spent in whichever geopolitical environment is most accommodating, even if that means it is used purely on the internet. The most important point then would be whether they could be exchanged for any other digital item that would be worth much value.


Understandable - it wasn't my intention. Transactional value as you described is absolutely critical for a currency. If that alone were the strength of Bitcoin, it would be a powerful system like PayPal. Indeed, merchant acceptance is growing primarily because of it.
What makes Bitcoin valuable as more than a transactional currency is its capability as a storage medium - that creates the incentive to hold it rather than play "hot potato" of sorts. Users hold onto it mainly because of a certain property; businesses use it mostly because of another.
These two aspects combined with the arms race in mining hardware results in a competitive cycle that I think is beyond the point where it could've been interrupted.

Extremely important from a merchant standpoint, especially for POS or any retail services.
The suggestion is that a merchant should not rebroadcast any received tx, while passively listening to a significant number of connections (~40+ according to the paper, and I assume at current network conditions). This will allow the merchant to watch for double spend attempts that must occur at nearly the same time as the initial tx to outpace that propagation.
Utilization of this technique should be available in v0.9 due soon. The end result is that 0-conf txs should be acceptable in as little as a few seconds with a high degree of confidence that it will be secure.

By attacking Bitcoin, attention is drawn to it. A percentage of people will gain a thorough understanding of it. Because of this, alt-chains will not be dismissed the way Bitcoin was over the last few years.
Also, any attempt at disruption will be met with adaptation. Should Bitcoin be incapacitated, it can improve itself, or other cryptocurrencies may move forward.
With no better alternative (gold excels as savings, but cannot function as a transactional medium in modern society without major counter-party risk), and the existing financial system collapsing, cryptocurrencies are the only viable alternative. There is nowhere else to go; Bitcoin *will* be made use of.

The influx of wealth into the system during growth will increase the *relative* value. With Bitcoin, this has led to extreme volatility. Maintaining a signficant reserve of a currency allows countering of such volatility during the growth phase, greatly reducing the reserve over time, if not exhausting it.
Solving the problems Bitcoin addresses, only from a different angle, also requires a different method of inception. A lot of emphasis is being placed on the momentary situation, which is *not* what the circumstances will be over time. The structure is dynamic, not static.
There's little reason to admonish profit motive this early in the game. Once Ripple's server source is released, the system will rapidly scale beyond OpenCoin's direct control. If the source is never opened, it will not be adopted. Period. Until then, why worry?

This is akin to growing pains - as the market grows to a wider global reach, and there are fewer new adopters, there will be much less volatility.
As for buying any amount, even having a single BTC is worthwhile. All you need to do is hold onto it. The key to this is that you won't exchange them, you'll be able to *spend* them virtually everywhere. That's when you'll know it's safe to make use of your Bitcoin savings.

Yours is a strong case and a valid point. At the same time, gearing Bitcoin as a transaction network alone leaves the system vulnerable to becoming a one-trick pony and dismantled by traditional financial institutions. A better tx network is an improvement, but other functionality makes Bitcoin unique.
One issue can be understood from an article about [off world economics]( With the real potential for physical supply shocks of immense magnitude, Bitcoin provides an immutable foundation.

What you describe is a clearing network. This is something that already exist for transactions among banks, such as the SWIFT system.
Ripple is important because it creates a common platform independent of banks - a way to exchange traditional financial instruments without requiring traditional institutions. While this is also possible using Bitcoin, the problem of double spending is approached from a different angle; the consensus model vs proof-of- work.
The XRP currency is entirely capable of acting as such, not just as stamps. However, the way it is structured means that it will not compete with Bitcoin as savings when both systems are mature. Where a BTC increases in value with growth of the overall economy, XRP simply maintain the same relative value. In other words, if 1 BTC is worth 1% of an economy this year, it may be worth 1.2% next year. An XRP in the same circumstance would be worth 1% perpetually, this year, next year, every year. Of course, values will fluctuate due to other factors, but the principle stands with all else being equal.
To sum: Bitcoin value *expands*; Ripple value *renews*.
In addition, as a credit system, Ripple may be subject to a situation similar to a liquidity crunch. Should that occur, Bitcoin could be used to settle debts in the Ripple network.

It's far more likely that the price will give way to the upside.
The range I'm looking at is higher and wider: 100-200mm. Many first gen ASIC mining hardware has already paid for itself, so only the marginal power (and possibly hosting) cost is a factor for those to run. The difficulty would have to reach about 10^9 for those to be unprofitable.
It's new hardware that hasn't hit breakeven which will push the price up, and the rise would be more gradual than the spikes we've seen in the past. At least until the rise triggers another speculative rush.

Perhaps I misinterpreted your statement regarding the blockchain purpose. Correct me if I'm wrong: I think you meant that once an *entry* in Ripple's blockchain is matched, it is removed - not the blockchain itself.


Agreed. It is possible that the complexity of transaction interrelations may grow to such an extent that the system becomes "clogged" in a way. That would be where a system like Bitcoin could act as a settlement method, freeing up the transactional system to continue operating smoothly.


Agreed again. Bitcoin *can* fulfill this role, but not until additional script functionality is enabled, and it will have the same vulnerabilities as before. In any case, Ripple's alternative approach makes the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem stronger.


That's where the settlement mechanism comes into play. Large sections of the transactional ledger can be cleared quickly should credit or data capacity become scarce.

A good read for perspective, but it falls to what I call the *economist arrogance syndrome*. The comments point this out rather well.
One of the author's statements was absurd, indicative of momentary thought instead of analysing the process past the point of adoption:


Really? Bitcoin is in a growth phase at the moment, so of course the value is volatile - mostly to the upside. If it becomes widespread enough to be used predominantly in the global economy, the value *will not* double over the course of a week. As an economy grows, a static supply currency will rise in value proportionately - what economy doubles in a week? None.
Bitcoin will continue to defy critics and "economists" because of rampant, linear thinking. There is much more to the system than what exists right now, but that will only become apparent to most over time.

Yes, it can happen in any system. The distribution method does not matter.
An early adopter had to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right knowledge, and the right perspective. Success is being prepared for opportunity. Many people will *never* be prepared. Early adopters are early adopters because they are able to see what others *cannot* or *will not*.

In general, yes. OT attempts to solve many of the same problems Ripple addresses. They do this via different means. Overall, OT is more of a monolithic design.
Regarding XRP: protecting against network abuse would have to involve some kind of expense or throttling.

The way it works means that there's little reason to hold XRP as an investment - they simply won't function the way holding bitcoins does.

First, it's based in Japan. If it did disappear, there are dozens of other exchanges, many of which are outside of US influence. This is similar to asking what would happen if the NYSE were to shut down permanently - it is not the only exchange, and there are multiple ways to trade assets aside from on public exchanges.
Holders of Bitcoin who exclusively use Gox would be unable to sell, so regardless of price, established supply would not flood the system. Instead, they would have to either use other exchanges and local services, or buy goods and services.
As long as there exists any method of exchange, and the incentive remains over holding other forms of money, the value will not go to zero. In addition, Ripple may soon completely remove the issue of exchanges, negating that weakness.

Waiting until source release is prudent for practical purposes, but there is nothing preventing anyone from analyzing and redesigning the system *conceptually*. So critics' arguments that there are "many different ways of solving what Bitcoin can't do" amounts to a lot of nothing without a conceptual basis for alternatives.
*Where are these proposed methods that don't involve Bitcoin's proof-of-work, a proof-of-stake system, or Ripple's consensus model - and why haven't they been published already?*
There are vulnerabilities involved with OT deployment that are circumvented by Bitcoin and Ripple. It also has the same barriers to adoption that Ripple will have to overcome, and that Bitcoin has already succeeded in breaching.
