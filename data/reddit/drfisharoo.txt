Except what's to stop me from taking his key and now saying I am him?  Nothing.  As long as I keep my presence either unknown or very carefully crafted to match his, no one is the wiser if I go to a random forum and say I am him.

And once again, who are you demanding help you?
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:23:57
That's exactly my point.  It is abused.  Why make it even easier to abuse?
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:36:14
Yes, because an anonymous currency being used for funding won't possibly be abused.

No I'm not.  What inherent value does bitcoin have?  None.  It has no inherent value.  What is its intrinsic value; its value independent of anything else?

Because some guy says he will accept them.  Look, I'm not saying their not useful, but the exact same reason why gold is valuable applies to bitcoin.  If tomorrow, everyone said "no" to bitcoin, guess what?  It'd be worthless. Same with gold, diamonds, fiat currency.
And a human, or any animal in general, has valuable because of its skin, fur, meat, work ability, what have you.  Your value comes from within.  Bitcoin's value comes externally.   It is the fact that there is a market for it that it has value.
Some of you get so lost in your own propaganda that you forget: bitcoin is just another form of barter.  That's it.  I'll give you 5x for 9q.     
If you can't accept the truth about what you're dealing with(and I think bitcoin is fine to deal in), then what are you doing here?  I never said there was anything wrong with Bitcoin.  Only that acting like it's somehow better than gold is ridiculous.  They both face the same potential problems.  Gold has just been around longer and is/has experienced more.

When you "delete" a file, the computer just forgets the address the information is stored at.  Its not until something else writes over that data that it is gone.  So actually, yeah, steal your drives, run a recovery tool and there's a decent chance your stuff could be stolen.

And who exactly are you going to demand this to?  You wanted an unregulated currency.  Well now you have it.  And when shit hits the fan, you have no one to turn to.  This is exactly why bitcoin isn't taken seriously.  You want it unregulated, but then complain when it doesn't have the security and protections of regulated currency.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:58:17
But really, why does bitcoin have value?  Because we say it does.  In the end, isn't it really code, backed by nothing, that we pretend is valuable?  Isn't that what money really is?
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:11:26
So *you* didn't research their fees and so *you* blame them for your own mistake.  Right...
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:59:59
I've yet to see bitcoin do anything impossible.  More efficient in certain cases?  Sure.  But impossible?  Nope.

I don't think you have a grasp on how being a sheister works out in the long run, but that's fine too.
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:16:55
And that is EXACTLY how the idiots fuck up their phones.  You don't know how to use your phone.  Sorry to have to tell you that.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:44:28
Guess what?  When that's already relatively doable, and options to buy and pay are already existing on phones, a huge markup for convenience is exactly that: a large markup for convenience.  You're market is the idiots.  If you can make that work, great, but don't be disappointed when the smart people shun you.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:06:33
That's not bursting my bubble.  I think only idiots should use them.  The rest of us know better ways.  Maybe if BTM owners were more reasonable, sane people would consider them too.  Until then, they're just a device to con idiots out of money using a novelty.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:04:30
Except that didn't stop him from doing what he did.  He, and only he, just can't do it again.  Someone else can make a scam and idiots will fall for it too.  There is no protection from that.  Free market woo!
