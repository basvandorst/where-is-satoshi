You are nuts.. the problem is not the method of payment, the problem is the national currency itself... the monetary debasement that happens in average countries because of rubbish central banks or political conflicts.. The future of bitcoin doesn't relies if its easier to buy things through the internet, it futures relies on the fact that people from countries like Argentina will be able to protect their wealth with bitcoin against their national currency (that in the past year suffered a giant devaluation)..
You guys are willing to see merchants to accept bitcoin, but that's a first world problem... the third world will be willing to use it to protect their financial lives...

How they are going to keep track of it? just transfer the coins to a new address and say that you 'just bought' the coins before you spent it.

Trading bitcoins for usd or any other currency is a business model and businesses should rely on agreements and contracts to work properly. We can't trust foolishly in the good will of an exchange just because they say so... I would feel much safer trading in an exchange that is regulated and supervised.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:18:09
We need regulation to protect us against cases like this one that is happening with MtGox. We need law support to ensure companies to act honestly and comply with their contracts.

How do you handle the transactions? Do you use an automatic invoice system that organize the things you are selling, create new addresses to every order and convert the exchange rate of Euros you charge to bitcoins? or do you use a regular wallet and do all these stuff by yourself?
That's important in my point of view, because I think bitcoin still not so easy-to-use when you need to handle a lot of transactions and keep track of it as a business that need to work with accounting and stock.

The exchange rate between the brazilian BRL and the USD increased 52% in the last three years.. bitcoin will be an excellent alternative to protect wealth..
In 2013 brazilians have paid 50% above the historical price for a single bitcoin, 3,600 BRL, while in the foreign market it was trading around 1,200 USD (meanwhile the exchange rate between BRL x USD was around 2.10)..
So, the brazilians are eagerly waiting to adopt bitcoin in the future. A solid exchange is something important and a pretty smart business, [considering the financial crisis that is just around the corner](

I'm a little confused about updating individual apps on linux.
You just did a *sudo apt-get upgrade*? Or had to download the LND binaries from github and checked the keys again?
On the guide when installing from scratch, after downloading and checking the keys, you did:
    $ tar -xzf lnd-linux-arm-v0.4.1-beta.tar.gz
    $ ls -la
    $ sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin lnd-linux-arm-v0.4.1-beta/*
But what commands should be used to just update the app? Considering I already downloaded the new version *lnd-linux-arm-v0.4.1-beta.tar.gz* to my */home/admin/download* and stopped the service *sudo systemctl stop lnd*...

I don't like the way that banks operate, not the greed side or those moral issues, but the efficiency side.. it's really inefficient to make transactions using the regular banking system, a lot of taxes and fares, delays and non-anonymity... we are obligated to use banks for our daily issues, so we are on their hands.. the bitcoin is an alternative, faster, secure and cheaper way to realize transactions.
No one ever went against efficiency, who did, failed.

answering the second question: The bitcoins are "anonymous" because there is no identification attached to it, but the company needs to provide a bitcoin adress (like a bank account) so the investor can send his money. Even though, the investor will be able to track the adress that he sent the money, because all the bitcoins transactions are public.

Silk Road represented 4,5% to 9% of all Bitcoins transaction in the middle of 2012.. but in one year we experienced the btc price going from 5 USD to 106 USD by now.. so, in my point of view the market changed a lot... the new people that bought bitcoins in the last year didn't come because of Silk Road.
This article published at Cornell University explain a lot of things: "Traveling the Silk Road: A measurement analysis
of a large anonymous online marketplace"
