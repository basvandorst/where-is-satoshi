A couple notes as a customer. Your post doesn't link to the coffee anywhere, and the navigation doesn't have a button that says "Shop" or anything like that. I had to hit your home page to find some coffee.

Also, I was thinking about this... whom ever buys this large amount will probably be buying them as an investment to HODL and won't be selling them right away for a quick profit. This means that there will actually be less available bitcoin on the market, thereby making bitcoin harder to come by, and increasing it's value.
In short..... this is actually good news!

Wouldn't this create a centralization problem again for things like voting? I mean it sounds like each computer in the future will be running nodes for many different blockchains. This sounds odd to me now to be running 10-20 different blockchain programs on my PC.
Is this the general idea of how things will work?
I know there are many blockchains with altcoins right now, but I'm talking about a much larger scale of blockchains, so I didn't know how we'd all adapt to keep everything running and not centralized.

Glad it's open sourced, but as someone who doesn't read all the code, I will not install an .exe program that I don't know. It could steal all my bitcoins, or pass on my passwords to someone else.

Hey, it's your money. They are suggesting a safer way to store your money, but in the end, you can do what ever you like.
For me, I keep small amounts in a wallet, and the long term savings in cold storage. Creating an address for cold storage is very simple with Blockchain, and requires no technical knowledge at all. Then, you can send money to that address just like you're paying someone else.
Be sure to save your paper in a safe place. It doesn't have to be hard to be a lot more secure than you are now. But as I said, it's your money.

I like this thought, I think. So for example, there can be locations all over the globe, just dedicated to keeping things running. At that point, attacking a server would be stupid since it's in the worlds best interest to keep them running (as opposed to a single country controlling all the servers).
Is this what you meant? It still sounds a little centralized to me, and I like the idea better of millions of smaller nodes all over the globe instead of dozens of large ones.

I have the hornetbomb sauce. It's pretty hot to me, and I wanted to order the more mild Garlic one, but $11.36 in shipping for a $5 hotsauce kills it. There has to be a cheaper way to send a small bottle than almost $12.

I think any sort of negative currency news for any country could have a positive impact on bitcoin adoption. I know that if the dollar were to collapse, I would be looking for a way to keep my monetary value, and if that meant transferring it all into a different currency, that's what I would do.

Holy cow, gold! Awesome!
It's a curse/blessing that I notice everyones differences. 
Once my wife and I had a cashier with only a thumb and pinky finger. I asked my wife later if she noticed, and she had no idea. She doesn't see anything like that with people, which is great, as she sees the person, and not their differences.
On the other hand, it pays to be observant sometimes (like today!) lol

The  thing I hate seeing here is that people had their coins stolen because of weak security.
For long term storage, find out how to make a secure paper wallet, and make sure to use a very unique custom passphrase on the private key.
I know that sounds like a foreign language, but it'll be worth your time and money to learn it.

I'm sorry, but almost all these replies make things complicated. There is a simple way with blockchain to make a paper wallet. 
Here is your guide, it's called "Cold Storage" (Look at the bottom right of the screenshot)
That's it, print out the wallet that shows up on screen as a PDF, or store the PDF encrypted somewhere with multiple backups.

This was a bit over my head, but I get it. This is what I thought would make the most since, a single blockchain which can be ran by anyone.
Do you think that as the blockchain grows, running a full node will eventually be outside the realm of possible for an average users PC?

Trying to place an order... about 20 clicks and no visible place to use the discount code.
I found out that the cart is where to place the discount, before going to checkout... but now that I've tried to checkout twice, it's telling me that the product is out of stock. I guess your website removes it from inventory before the payment is complete.
Can you please contact me when it's ready to order again? HornetBOMB Hot Sauce is what I wanted.
Also, I suggest switching over to bitpay if you can... WAY easier to make payments, therefor you will get more customers. The only reason I'm jumping through these hoops to buy something I don't really need is to support bitcoin merchants.

Review:  
* * * * * 5 Stars  
Bought a hat one night, but my payment didn't go through properly (my fault). I emailed Kenny at  and he promptly replied with instructions on how to fix the order. I even changed the hat order from the centered logo to the offset logo. The next day he shipped it out, and I got it within 1 day.
Awesome Hat! 
Only thing I'd change is the under part of the rim being gray. I live in a very dirty area, and have a toddler who loves playing outside, and I can not wear my hat unless I'm perfectly clean and don't plan on playing.
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:08:15
The one in the picture? No clue.
There is a decentralized online market place called OpenBazaar, but some people want to change the name, this is one of the names mentioned. Well, Freedom Market, but this is pretty close.

What I do for some sites is use a password manager, like Lastpass to store my passwords. For my wallet for example, I may delete one or two characters from the end, beginning, wherever I want. 
Then when I visit the site later, it auto fills out THE WRONG PASSWORD, I simply click in the password box, type in the one or two missing characters, and poof, security against keyloggers.
This also helps for those afraid to use a "centralized" password manager.

I can't pose every possible question in the main comment. Initially I thought that that it was just a person who happened to work at Yelp, but by posing the question the way I did, I would probably have a better chance at finding out the answer I was after.
It could really be either of the two possibilities, but I chose to post one as a question. If I had said "I wonder if the buyer is buying them for personal reasons" then I'm sure someone would have said something about Yelp wanting to buy them.

Typically you only stay for a couple weeks, and skimp on the water usage. You have to get creative with the waste too. They make containers for transporting waste to town if you have a 2nd vehicle. This means you can boondock, but still be within driving range of towns.

The number 1 thing I wanted to test with your wallet is the coinjoin to test it's anomonity. Since the original alpha release, I have not been able to successfully send any funds using mixing. I just tried again, and it sent without.

Sporting events. I love MMA and the thought of every fighter having their own QR code for bitcoin payments from the fans is awesome! 
Imagine the adrenaline going through the audiences body seconds after the fight is over. Now is there are 2 million people watching a great fight at home, on average, they might give $1 to the better fighter. That's money straight in to the fighters wallet!
Imagine how much harder the fighters would try to win the fans support during a fight... there would never be a boring moment.
