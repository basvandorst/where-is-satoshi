If I have my btc in a classic ledger nano s wallet, how do I make segwit transactions?

This is exactly what I’m doing when I take profit. Been eyeing the ceramic Daytona. Only issue is whether I should get the black or white...

No business can succeed in China without allowing total and complete regulation from the government.

This just goes to show that he doesn’t care about his customers, reputation or the future of blockchain as long as there is personal gain for himself. 
I will never touch anything that is associated with roger ver.

Thanks! But the first transfer will be a classic transactions right? E.g high fees?

If I have my coins in a ledger using a non-Segwit wallet, can I transfer to a swegwit address?

I am about to do the exact same thing when I take profit. Awesome buy!

This is not just state owned electricity company but specifically hydroelectric power. 
It’s more of a policy to control where the cheap hydroelectricity is going and regulating smaller hydroelectric dams.
I don’t think it will make a major impact. But I hope this will take power away from Chinese miners.
