Thank you for taken the time out to respond. Any recommendations?
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:57:38
Thank you as well. No problem.

Lmao! ����

Trust me, once it's in the location the buyers will find it. You'll do a little advertisement and promo and before you know it the BTM will be flooded with traffic. Have you seen the bitteller.io BTM's? There little small ones. I think that will be my first to test a location I have my eye on.

How can we buy if we get access to a Chinese bank account? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:03:35
It was a draw! 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:23:19
How? But yet there's tons of btc machines around. My friend has one in his store right now and he said ever since they put it there business has increased significantly. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:06:55
Does a lot of people in your country use btc? And would they benefit from it? Because I know where I'm at many many people use btc and a lot of them have no idea about fee differences and just love the relatable feeling to using a machine similar to ATM to purchase their bitcoin. I spoke to some people and some are even buying through a local middle man without a clue of exchanges and etc
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:46:44
Yes. I want one.

I'm down to donate and gather donations. We just have to find someone with an address in PuertoRico

Probably way more than that 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:00:57
I'm in NewYork and I know. There is also little ones that cost around 1k. The price is why I want to partner up with some friends. I know plenty store owners that would appreciate the extra traffic coming to their stores from BTM
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:54:21
They're really small I've seen one at this coffee shop in manhattan. Check them out. I think it's good to test a area
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:10:38
Probably more than that
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:08:41
You do know that they're either owned or affiliated with banks? Bitcoin wants to avoid banks and banks want to avoid bitcoin. Bad idea! We don't want to be tracked down and taxed down.

In my opinion, Canelo looked much sharper throughout the fight. Idk why it if it's just me but GGG looked "woobly" as I would say. He didn't look as strong as he normal does as he always dominates most rounds in his fights. I just didn't see the same GGG in the ring last night. But I guess he performed well enough to make a draw with Canelo
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:27:19
They'll all be $10 richer in BTC
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:47:08
Lol. Hell yea I am. When they explain why they're selling a product in USD and how can we ensure security in case something fuckd up happens, that's when I'll consider giving them 10% of my trust
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:45:23
You should be responsible enough to not let hackers get a hold of anything you do. There is enough info out there. Hardware wallets are the biggest scam in my eyes. I just don't understand how so many brilliant people fall victim to a business that only wants to profit. You can use a paper wallet if you don't trust Coinbase that insures you. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:45:20
How much?
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:26:10
I know. The point I am trying to make is that they shouldn't accept fiat at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:30:04
Do you trust yourself? Or do you trust a company selling you a product for USD? If you trust yourself then use a paper wallet and if you trust people that provide security then use Coinbase. Fuck all of that meonophobic bullshit they tell you to sound mind blowing. They only want to sell a product for USD to a community that doesn't support USD anymore. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:57:19
I'm on it. Trying to get access now.

You check my history. What do you see. Everything Bitcoin. Dummy.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:27:07
I trust MYSElF and I know that NO keylogger will be able to grab shit from me. Can I say the same about Trezor and ledger? Hell no! I don't even know them. I don't know who made my device. I don't know who shipped me my device and I don't know who delivered my device. I don't trust them. I trust myself and Coinbase because Coinbase provides security!

Did you ever have a problem with Gemini?
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:56:19
Yes. I'm looking for someone to partner up with. I have connections and the ability to take care of all the necessary ground work. I've seen ATMs here charge as much as 10% and up and people have no problem with it. In fact, most teens and the average user don't even think about the fee. It's people like us who are aware and investing that are more tight on fees. Every neighborhood has a go to guy for bitcoin. I'm pretty sure they take a huge cut, way more than ATMs are charging. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:14:51
What do you love to do? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:56:22
I am also interested in doing the same. I want to gather a group of my friends to a open a string of ATM machines around my city. I also want to have a string of miners around as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:12:49
We are a community of people that hate taxes and hate the government spying on our personal lives. That is why we use BTC. We want to be able to send $1,000,000 over to Russia instantly, without nosey governments on our backs. PayPal will put governments on our backs if we send anything above 15,000 to Russia. ������

Thank You so much! Looking into now.

Let's make it happen
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:23:40
Show me Trezor and Ledger's non-existent referral program. They are a business that are profiting off of bitcoin users. THEY SHOULD BE ACCEPTING ONLY BITCOIN! BITCOIN businesses should only ACCEPT BITCOIN. We don't fuck with FIAT! PERIOD and a company that supports FIAT, I can't trust. Also they provide no security. No insurance. No nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:53:27
Yes you are. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:32:20
No. Keep your transactions with Coinbase. Do not buy those stupid hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:16:20
You already wasted you time during the process of commenting. You are very impulsive and I can tell by what you said. You just had to waste your time because you  don't agree and you just had to comment. Great, now I know something about you. That's data. Anyway, I don't give a flying f*** what kind of seeds they use, they're selling for USD and they provide me no security. They can abandoned ship at anytime and I'm f***** Coinbase provides security. Me controlling my own key via paper wallet without BUYING for USD provides me security because I trust myself!
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:38:45
Did you use all your correct information? Coinbase is not crap. They are reputable. The most reputable. GOOGLE
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:10:19
I don't care how they work. I see right through the bs. Those companies only want to make money! They provide me no safety and I can't trust someone who isn't credible and doesn't provide me security. Coinbase provides security!
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:17:54
Very suspicious comment history patter for this user....Lol, you're funny. I'm speaking the truth and all of the suckers are mad. You guys bought into something that doesn't believe in Bitcoin. You guys could of just printed a paper wallet or stuck with Coinbase but you let the exact same thing they did when money was created years and years ago happen to you. You fell for the marketing scheme to sell you a product. Wow. Stick with COINBASE my man. Ditch the bullshit hardware wallet. Trust yourself above all and Gemini isn't reputable. You google and COINBASE will come up. Gemini won't pay you BTC to bring more customer. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:55:54
Thank you and I don't mind clicking ads because I know it will pay whoever is streaming it. I like to support. I sent you something. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:17:13
So when they want to buy, let's say a tshirt I'm selling, they would much rather go right to the local deli where a bitcoin ATM is stationed and get btc to buy what I'm selling. They wouldn't think of the fee too much. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:25:31
Good job. Do you have anymore dirt bikes? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:47:37
How do we buy at this price? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:22:50
I'm sure you didn't buy from Trezor.io
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:21:13
Why you say that? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:51:35
Paper wallet. Why didn't you print one?
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:36:49
The best answer 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:35:05
Digital Currency
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:42:25
Trezor doesn't even let you see your private keys
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:34:12
That's good. and you mean 100% I am glad they hold in a cold storage. Even better. I'm happy they insure me for anything they do wrong. Trezor.io doesn't insure me shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:58:17
To properly setup a paper wallet isn't hard. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:12:30
I thought the same thing. They probably paid  a couple hundred thousands just for that Instagram post
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:00:26
Yea. And where I am, the people just want quick and easy access to BTC so they can do their stuff. A lot of teenagers are in and out of the stores to purchase btc
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:10:41
They don't believe in Bitcoin. They accept fiat and that is mind blowing to me. REAL Bitcoin users reject fiat. BS they are not accepting USD to convert to BTC because of fees. They are accepting USD to use at strip clubs and to put in traditional banks. FRAUDS! How can I trust someone who doesn't believe in the users of the product their selling? This is the equivalent to Chinese people selling Chinese food in NYC that they don't eat themselves. I DON'T BUY IT IF THEY DON'T EAT IT THEMSELVES! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:22:50
Coinbase is safe! Your funds are covered by insurance and they aren't selling you a product for USD. Trezor and ledger selling a product for fiat? Cmon it's common sense. They don't believe in BTC and they want to profit off of those who do. The main goal for them is to make money. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:01:36
Lookup GDAX and comb back to me. Coinbase is both a brokerage and exchange my man.
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:36:16
You still didn't go into details. This is click bait 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:35:13
Yea and I see many people frustrated with accessing BITCOIN and it would be much easier for them to just walk down to the deli and buy. It would benefit businesses that run solely on bitcoin tremendously. This is why I want to open a string of BTMs in my neighborhood. I'm a true believer of Bitcoin  and what it stands for. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:03:11
No? What do you mean no. Trezor and ledger are both sold for USD and Euro. Aren't we trying to push bitcoin? Why sell a bitcoin product for USD? I know the answer. On top of that, they operate on this stupid website and software. Suppose Trezor abandoned the site and software and I can't use my password to access my keys?  Paper wallet! Stop letting these people profit off of you by selling lies.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:44:08
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:56:23
That's the thing. I want to see the day all of those merchants accept solely BTC! It's Satoshi's vision! You guys are using BTC for all the wrong reasons. Coinbase isn't responsible for irresponsible people. You get hacked that's because you weren't responsible! You should of practiced safety. At least they offer something for the keys that are stored online. They also give you access to two or three keys, do your research! Coinbase also gives you an opportunity to make bitcoin and you can use GDAX 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:10:28
It has to be the first time you wasted your time as well right? Why comment? Because you, like many suckers, bought a hardware wallet. All of you guys got duked! You bought from a company that doesn't even believe in BTC. They're all in a strip club right now throwing USD 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:19:11
I bet you didn't something wrong. That is why your account froze. I've had Coinbase for literally 4years with NO PROBLEM. Verify all of your information correctly with no lies and you will have no problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:02:15
Lookup GDAX and come back to me. Coinbase is both a brokerage and exchange my man.
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:14:38
Yes, I know that. But you want to know what I observed? The average person doesn't think about those fees. We do, because we are into Bitcoin and know a lot. The average person that wants to buy what they want to buy they will not think twice about paying a 15% fee. They don't even think of it in percentage. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:42:38
Yea. You should be responsible. Every adult should practice safety online. Your credentials get compromised with Trezor or Ledger you get nothing and if something goes wrong with their software or hardware you get nothing. Coinbase is the future and they are backed by big reputable businesses. Trezor.io is not supported by Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:58:05
You just said the obvious. I want to APPEAL to a DIFFERENT demographic my friend. These "very high standard" journalist aren't appealing to everyone. I know how to catch the eye of those. I just need a writer. I

Open a string of bitcoin Atms with me and earn! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:14:59
So why does 80 percent of Bitcoin users use Coinbase? What do you use since their fees are so high? I can bet my BTC you use Coinbase!
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:03:23
Lol wtf
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:28:19
Was all your information accurate? Usually frozen accounts come from people who use bought information. Coinbase finds out and handles it. They don't play when it comes to security. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:47:25
Coinbase hold less that 2% of it's customers BTC online. So what does that tell you? Your BTC is safe once it's not online. When it is online it is insured. Which I love. Coinbase is reputable. Coinbase is backed. Who is trezor and who is ledger? What do they give me? Why should I trust them? Exactly. And then they accept USD for a product? Cmon!
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:26:32
So how come my funds are all fine. I use COINBASE for 4 years. Never had any troubles. I contact support for minor issues and they get fixed within 24hrs.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:49:28
Go to YouTube and Search how to buy bitcoin with no fees. You'll find several videos instructing you on how to do so using Coinbase with GDAX . 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:49:48
Yes, but the average person around here doesn't know that and would love to cut the guy their paying for bitcoin out of the picture. That's how they do it around here, they buy from a guy they call the "btc man" With them using ATM much more useful and I see that in different areas. The Btc atms bring lots of traffic 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:52:45
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:42:23
They are an exchange. Do some research on bitcoin exchanges. Learn how they operate as a business and you will find out Coinbase is the best one as well. Coinbase believes in Bitcoin and is the present and future of Bitcoin users. Hardware wallets can't get a dollar out of me. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:54:32
I know that buddy. WTH! LOL! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:16:32
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:51:43
Coinbase is the best. It's the safest in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:53:34
Why didn't you use a paper wallet? They accept Fiat. That's a no no.
Bitcoin users are not fiat supporters. So we used fiat to purchase a product to store BTC and you wonder why the laws want to tax BTC...............
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:49:02
Me? I never bought a scam wallet. I'm an avid COINBASE user and I LOVE COINBASE and GDAX
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:05:13
Lol! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:13:10
Please don't. Use Coinbase, Blockchain.info, or a paper wallet. Don't support a company that doesn't believe in bitcoin and that doesn't provide you security. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:13
Thank you �� 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:21:07
Yep. I believe everyone should.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:39:54
I love the idea. We'll just have to see. Hey man, stay in touch. We can probably think of something and see where it takes us. Right now, I want someone who can write about bitcoin but word it the simplest way possible so we can appeal to a different demographic. I want to use video and photos to appeal to them as well. I know how to make that happen. We just need someone that can write. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:26:05

@_date: 2017-10-17 01:47:47
Not sure. But the point is, they are accepting Fiat currency. Doesn't that raise a red flag? I'm sorry but I'm very passionate about bitcoin and what it stands for. It seems like so many confused people here and people that are just using bitcoin with the hopes of becoming rich. SMH!

Because you haven't started it. Start it bro.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:38:49
From where? not Trezor.io. I promise you didn't. You don't know what happened in the process of shipping and delivering your device. Also, call trezor.io and ask them why not sell for BTC if they're selling a product for the BTC community. Aren't we against fiat currency? Does Trezor offer this:

@_date: 2017-10-17 02:36:48
They charge fees in what you use. They have to accept fiat in order to convert btc and deal with banks. Coinbase is an exchange platform. Not a scam company that saw an opportunity to profit
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:24:56
Parse your reddit fingers somewhere else. You're just another sucker who bought a hardware wallet. I've used COINBASE for 4 years and never had no trouble and I know if something happens I am insured. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:50:26
When your BTC's are offline in a reputable companies cold storage, that's backed by millionaires and billionaires, you have nothing to worry about. When you get some stupid device that you paid for with USD then you should be worried.

Idk. Where can I watch?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:30:22
No, all businesses don't only want profit. Business want to satisfy customers. Businesses want to provide great service or provide a great product. That comes before profit. Learn! I'm a business man and that why I see through the scam wallets being sold by trezor and ledger. SMH!
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:42:57
First, I should ask why are you getting into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:00:41
I just want to know why they accept fiat for their products. Who makes their products and what kind of security they offer me other than offline storage. Let's say their system shuts down, how will I access my keys? I can't and will never be able to.
