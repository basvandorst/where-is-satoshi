Unless you move yourself out of the country.

I bought 1 BTC at $20k with cash, it rose and fell and then I sold it for $20k. What what point do they know I'm lying? (Given Bitcoin hits $20k)

Hold on, how could the IRS know how much you purchased the coins for? Especially if you used cash to purchase the coins, how could they prove just how much capitol gains you should be paying (given that they realize you should be paying capitol gains)?

I know there wouldn't be any capital gains on that, but my point was what if I was lying about at what point I bought? So, only if I bought through an exchange there would be a risk?

One of the problems you run into is spoofed numbers. They remder any suspected spam list by claiming to be someone else.

I would suggest Hiya. They have a spam/fraud list, a suspected spam list, ability to block private numbers, but the feature I like best is the ability to block an entire area code. It works exceptional well since I don't live in that area anymore and anyone who would call me is already in my contacts.

From an information standpoint, there's very little provided, it's just a voice of some twenty something male, which isn't very much to start with. There are no location specific sounds in the recordings. There's no images to look into exif. None of the tricks I've seen used could work.

Depends on where the logs are kept. Or if the logs have been deleted.

If they sell a product, it's legitimate. The t-shirts aren't being sold for $10,000. I'm confused.

In what way is that money laundering? I was under the impression that journalists could sell products. Did something change?
