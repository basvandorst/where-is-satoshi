You have to look at the pros of a brain wallet, and mitigate the cons. I have already mitigated the cons, now I just need to know how to use it in tandem with a secure transaction method.

Aren't you opening risk to yourself during the transfer of the unsigned and signed transactions?

Okay, so what if this was my passphrase:
kdieo angorq sdngl jmfyl qojmi aqsle qdole fqmjro
And that got hacked. Wouldn't that prove that brainwallets are definitely insecure?
I guess I could memorize the private key. I just thought the brain wallet would make it much easier to remember for myself.

I didn't downvote anybody, just to be sure..

So, basically, what you're telling me is: I can take 14 regular unrelated English words, jumble them up into a mess, and hackers won't be able to crack that?
Then why couldn't I do the same with a brainwallet?

I don't see how the seed is any better, it's still in English, and English is the most common language of hackers, no?

If my brainwallet gets hacked, I will display my compromised brainwallet to the internet, and that will definitively prove that brainwallets are a completely insecure method, despite all the current rebuttals, I assure you of that.

I agree with you on that. But I have a use for brainwallets with its cons in mind. In other words, I won't be using them much like how most people use them, with easy common words and all. So the brainwallet miners really don't bother me.
What really bothers me is taking the time to do all of this offline. I heard that you can use proprietary software and keys to perform offline transactions so that your private keys never touch an online PC's keyboard. I think this with a stellar brainwallet is a very convenient and flexible combo.
Another solution I had was to simply remember the private key so I can skip all the third-party interfacing. What do you think about that?

I don't get it, what's to stop someone from inventing their own language and using that as a base for a passphrase? Am I missing something?

Dirty thief.
