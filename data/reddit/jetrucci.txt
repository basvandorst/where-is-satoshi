Alright bud, you seem to know a lot. Keep bringing your precious coins to shitty exchanges. I take my words back.

Every investment is risk but there is a fucking reason why people say don't keep them on the exchanges.

That's stupid. If it were bitcoin, you would call it bitcoin, not bcash.

And those who buy it, must sell from a higher price.
What a great idea!
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:27:40
Now they should know that they shouldn't have sold it so those who bought from $10-20K now exactly know what they need to do.

Mined bitcoins are fresh. Without any history.
Since every bitcoin movement is recorded on the blockchain, there is a chance that what you bought from the exchange has a criminal history.
I know that sucks and maybe not that important but it is there. Some people want it to be "clean"
@_date: 2018-10-14 08:19:35

I don't see any altcoins with liquid sidechain.
Liquid is exclusive to bitcoin. That's why we celebrate.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:55:56
A node is a peer. If you don't use your node to send&amp;receive coins, you are not a peer but using someone else's peer.
The term "peer to peer" is related to this.
People usually don't care about being a peer, or verifying the network rules but this is what bitcoin is all about and it is important.
Don't be a sheep, be a peer.

Nope that's not what i am doing. You trying to twist my words.
I am saying liquid is a side chain build on top of bitcoin. That's it.
It is you who say liquid isn't bitcoin while nobody says it is. You even say it is not a sidechain but an altcoin which is not just false, but also misdirecting.

If you don't like the way people short bitcoin, then go buy more bitcoins and teach them a lesson so they won't short it again. Markets aren't emotional. They don't care what you think. If there is money to be made, people are going to make it.

Looks like if you fiddle with some parameters like dbcache, you can keep the SSD safe from harm.

You have many options to pick. I personally believe we will test $100k in 2-3 years but who knows. Some people regret that they didn't sell at $20k. If $500k is enough for you to accomplish your dreams, then go for it.
You can even start a solid business in any country you want with that amount.
It still very well may go as low as $3k too. Hard decision. We are also down from $20k and that means -%68 since December's ATH which makes it even a harder decision. I mean it is already low, makes no sense to sell while it is that low but on the other hand it can go even lower :/

Things were fine back then, don't blame others for your own mistakes.
USA created that debt shit just to survive because they shouldn't have survived back in the day. They were weak, they were about to lose, so they cheated.
Others has beaten USA in its own game and that same others are about the beat the very same USA in the USA's new game again. Even they got that printing machine, they thought it'll save them, guess what China owns shitton USD even though USA owns the goddamn machine.
This time, there is nowhere to hide.

Ltc is around almost since the beginning so that kinda makes me trust LTC more than the other alts.

Currency is what people prefer to use and control. It isn't necessarily controlled by cb's. In the end a central bnk and a country is also controlled by people. Bad people, good people, greedy people or dumb people? Depends.

Changing the currency is not going to magically solve the problems instantly. (It is a long term solution)
Greece is using a strong currency, as Bulgaria. Both of them are having problems.
If Venezuela was using USD or BTC or Gold, instead of Bolivars, do you think they could have avoided the shitstorm they are experiencing now?
Don't think so.
FIAT is shit that's for sure but having corrupt leaders, lazy and dumb people is a far more important problem for a country.

If you are trying to protect your wealth against hyperinflation, you don't are about the monthy swings on the price.
Have you ever heard the term, long term investment?
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:58:06
If selling at this point is going to make you happy don't wait. Just sell them.
If you have bigger dreams and expectations... Don't.
However it is a very unlikely possibility, but it is still there, one day btc might go to "$0".
I know the probability is very close to "0" but you can read the same thing on bitcoin.org. This is an experimental project and you should only invest the amount which is not going to hurt you if you lose it.
I don't say "Don't invest more than you could afford to lose" because nobody can afford to lose money.
Instead of doing all-ins, all outs; you should come up with a long term plan where you invest in bitcoin with some of your income. I am not saying with all your income since there are other investment options too (stocks, gold, hoarding good domains etc...) but obviously btc is my favorite.
Dollar cost averaging works wonders on bitcoin portfolios. One month you buy from the top price but the next you get from the bottom. In the end you get the market average. At least that's what I do. 
I sold some of my coins back in 2014 and bought some pretty stuff with them when the price was $1k. Those pretty stuff ain't that pretty anymore and I bought back the coins I sold earlier from $8-10k.
TLDR; Hodl.
Edit: I didn't sold a satoshi when the price was $20k. You may call me dumb. Holding since $1k.

I am telling the same thing to everyone when they ask me about bitcoins. First, buy some amount which is not going to hurt you if everything goes to shit. Second, never ever sell a single dime till you reach to your dreams. Half a million is my aim and i'll never ever gonna send a single satoshi till i get there. No way. I only got 2 bitcoins but i add more from time to time. Those 2 bitcoins costed me around 800bucks and i took the chances to lose them at that time. No regrets.

It is however, nor borderless neither easily verifiable.
Actually it may even not have limited supply too. Sea water, moon, other planets etc. it is pretty much unlimited supply. Only the tech to extract gold is limited.

Newbies, take notes.
Always keep your coins in your own wallet where you own the private key.
Do not ever let your coins stay on a 3rd party wallet especially if the company has an investor called "Roger Ver" who is the biggest scammer the world of crypto has every seen.

You can verify the on going network rules, relay your out going transactions and confirm other transactions with your node.
If you use your node to send/receive transactions, then you are not trusting anyone.
If you use other 3rd party wallet services for getting/sending bitcoins, you are trusting that 3rd party's good will.
Don't trust, Verify. -satoshi nakamoto
Most of the time you might not feel the need of running a full node but it is great to know that you can do it when you want to. Unlike some shitcoins like bcash where it is or will be impossible to run one (except for companies)  in the future .
Shitcoins like bcash basically want you to trust their good will. That's why they don't want you to run a full node. As you know from history, their will is not good.

isnt paper wallets are cold storage wallets at the same time?
If you create your paper wallet on a pc without an ethernet/wifi card then it is a cold storage wallet my logic tells me.
And another thing you are probably missing is, you can create paper wallets from anything. From your own seed words, bitcoin core wallet, electrum, wallet generator or bitadress website (offline mode) ... a paper wallet is just a paper where you have your private key written on.
Tldr; I don't agree with you. Paper wallets are the safest wallet you can ever have. There might be a %0.0000000001 security risk because of the method you choose to create the wallet and in the end you'll dodge that risk just like you dodge wallet thieves who search for the private keys with balance on allprivatekeys.com

Yes mine is a pi3. It was starting just fine but something went wrong i think and the connection between pi and my hdd was lost. That's why chromium crashed. The connection never made it back and reboot didn't solve anything. I'll try again when i get back home in the evening, i'm at work now. Thanks for everything :)
My HDD might be the problem. It is a seagate 500gb model which draws less than 0.5A as current. It is connected to a USB hub with a power adapter. Pi sees the HDD just fine so there is no problem there. Dunno...

I never had a problem with the lcd. I found an image from a trusted website; RPi-35inch-LCD-Raspbian-160715.img and it worked like a charm. I made a progress yesterday. I was unmounting one drive of the hdd. Now I know, I had to unmount every one of them before i use the commands. (For some weird reason, there are 2 partitions and i can't merge them)  That's why it said they were in use. And I was using the wrong command: "sudo ./adafruit-pi-externalroot-helper -d /dev/sda5" Because the partition i wanted to use was the biggest one named sda5...
But i should have used "sudo ./adafruit-pi-externalroot-helper -d /dev/**sda**" sda only.
Well It all went well after those, it said restart the device aaand its white again. That was with my image file now i'll try again with yours.

Vermin is always trying to get the shares of new developing businesses before they become big.
By doing this he is trying to control the possible threats to his main partnerships with bitpay/coinbase/blockchain.info etc...
It is like you start a specific business on a street like a barbershop... then you pay the rent for all the other shops on the street so they won't be opening another barbershop. (You can change barbershop with smth more suitable) By doing it this way if the business you start is too profitable, you'll be able to pay the rents for the other shops, you'll still be making shitloads of money and plus, you'll be controlling the market so no one is going to be a threat to your honey maker.
He is exactly doing that. Like a cancer. We need to say "no" matter how much money he offers. Eventually he will disappear.

Think it like this way, gold has finite supply that's right but it is impossible to affect the spot price just by selling/buying physical gold. The market is beyond huge and the problem is nobody can calculate the exact gold supply. Even if they do, it won't be as certain as bitcoin's supply.
Now think it like this, if they manage to short bitcoin for long long times, Let's say they successfully shorted bitcoin to $1k what'll happen then? Some rich ass guy or... thousands of bitcoin fans will be buying bitcoin like there is no tomorrow. Eventually the supply will dry out. You won't be finding any sellers at some point but people will be buying anyway.
Then what? Price goes fuckin UP!
Long story short, I don't believe futures can tame bitcoin. All they can achieve is cheap bitcoin for everybody for a short period of time.
And this is no different than what we experienced after gox crash. Price goes up, price goes down. Then up again. No big deal.
