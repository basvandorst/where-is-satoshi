To a degree,yes. Gold is only worth what it's worth because that's the price people will buy it at. 
The dollar was originally backed by gold. It is now only backed by the US government. A lot of people don't like that. Hence bitcoin. 
You should read the white paper for bitcoin. It's 9 pages and came out with the protocol to explain exactly why it works. A quick Google search should point you in the right direction.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:24:19
Well that's not quite true. We only made things with gold at first because it's shiny. We only recently realized it's other uses. The fact that it's shiny made it valuable. 
Bitcoins value is it's security as a platform. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:17:28
Definitely not telling you to put any money into it. Just saying the white paper will help you understand what it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:53:35
It's "backed" in the same way gold is backed. People give it value. 
People give bitcoin value because it is more secure than most of the folks in this thread probably think. 
The idea of permanance on the internet WITHOUT a central authority (like a bank or government) is more novel than you think. That's why the blockchain is so important. It's a ledger of every single bitcoin transaction ever made. And it won't go away unless every single computer running the bitcoin network (worldwide mind you) suddenly shut off.

Why do you want bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:57:37
Is there a site that allows me to do instant Bank transfers? It's crazy to me that it takes 7 days for a payment to go through on coinbase. Also which site has the most curencies if I pretty much just wanted to stick to top 20 coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:35:16
Bitcoins can still be sold and traded once you hit 21mil. 
8 decimal places and all that. They don't make anymore gold either, doesn't make it less valuable.

It's very telling when Bloomberg says it "won't be used in our lifetime" 
Yeah, that's cause you're an old fuck. Very few young people interested in BTC give a shit what Bloomberg has to say.

Quoinex or Gate.io 
I transfered ETH to gate.io to buy mine 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:56:47
Good on you actually posting sources. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:09:28
Lol, lucky you. Unfortunately I got in at 11,200. Not a good start. ive missed the lambo train, but I'm pretty sure I've made it in time for the mortgage payments one day train. 
Gonna be putting in like 40 bucks a week going forward. Maybe more 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:35:11
Well yeah. Coinbase only lets you move 10,000$ a week

Look man,I'm not a doctor, but that's not just dysphoria. You are right I don't know what it's like, but it sounds like you need serious help. 
Hope the rest of your life treats you better than the first part. Stay safe.

Thanks for sharing this! Put a lot of things into perspective. Still watching

You can transfer youre BTC to Gdax instantly and do it there. Gdax is the exchange coinbase is built from 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:39:36
Yo, ignore that prick. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:51:42
It's not surprising. Bitcoin is cumbersome to pay with. Transactions take too long

Binance 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:56:54
I've been listening to it. It was recorded when they were impressed it hit $300... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:10:44
The first is made by the people who actually created Qash, you can buy in USD I think. 
Gate.io is cryptos only. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:26:55
That's what finally convinced my buddy. "you aren't buying stocks in some company called Bitcoin, you are trading USD for money called Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:34:12
Not really related to BTC or crypto specifically. But I really recommend anyone read the book The Total Money Makeover. It's a stupid fucking title, but it's a genius book about debt management. 
I'm in the camp of less investments untill all debts except the house are paid off. Debt is evil and weighs on your back. Even if you may make more in the long run hodling it, the whole point of crypto is getting out of the hands of centralized banks and such, right? 
I'm not a mega investor, I'm still pretty new to this, (I have like $250 in various things, that's it) but I know how much credit card debt sucks. I just paid off my final card 2 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:29:53
What happens at a halving? I realized it's when the BTC mined goes from 12.5 to 6.25, but do prices go up or down? Would it be good to save up USD to buy a lot of BTC right after the halving? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:28:31
Holy shit. Are you buying prescription meds from the internet without consulting and actual doctor? What the fuck. Why would you do this? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:52
Basically yes. You would have to pay taxes on all the income though 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:43
I don't think you understand what he's asking. The transaction id is basically public info anyway, it helps see what happened. Was probably a transfer fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:33:24
The tech itself doesn't need registration. Individual websites that buy and sell currencies do though if you want to follow their rules. 
The idea is that you could move it off of gdax into a secure, anonymous wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:27:58
How do they work? Are you supposed to bring your seed words with you or something? Or does the machine just scan your public address. I'm still a little confused about how I send money without carrying around that flashdrive thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:23:04
I'm new to this space, but wasn't that always the "thing?" You have the keys,it's your coin, they have the keys, it's their coin. 
In the end. It's your fault technically if you aren't controlling the keys. Which is a benefit of crypto in many peoples opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:38:49
Didn't know I could do that. Sweet! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:39:43
Well I also have a little in eth and a little in litecoin. (Like really a little. Like $50 total at the moment) everyone is saying litecoin sucks and only exists because of coinbase. Thinking of switching it to Qash and seeing how that goes. While continuing to put into ETH and BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:39:14
Dude. Seriously. Fuck off.

Should have done it 4 hours ago. Was $9500
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:03
Well yeah, but Bitcoin has the benefit of being the Kleenex of crypto. Something tells me 11k isn't close to the cap 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:51:42
I'm in the same boat. Only bought $200 though. Not too beat up. This is an investment, not beer money. This will only get bigger over the next 5 years

As someone who got double charged on a debit card for a transaction just last week you are just being naive. 
Please tell me how I messed up a debit card transaction?

Thanks for sharing that, Turns out I thought shorting was a completely different thing. 
I always figured it just meant betting someone that the price will go down (if it goes below X you owe me $1000, if it goes above Y, I owe you $1000) 
I mean, it is kinda betting that the price will go down, but not quite in the way I thought.
