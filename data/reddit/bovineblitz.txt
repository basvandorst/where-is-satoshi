Isn't a BTC minority chain way easier to kill off due to the way difficulty scales?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:47:57
Miners job is to act in their own rational self interest for profit.  Dev job is to ensure that the design takes that into account while keeping the system from breaking.
If you expect the miners to do anything not based on self interest, you're thinking about it wrong.

It reminds me of the astroturfing in American politics the last eight months. It honestly feels very similar with the over the top, disingenuous, seemingly coordinated attacks by the bigger, more well-funded organization.

I'm thinking about going even more into alts than that, they're starting to really become legit. Too much is worrying me about btc and gains are going to be slow.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:40:13
I wonder how much is shills and how much is normal people like me who worry that bitcoins lack of a clear direction is a legitimate disadvantage when compared to an alt with a specific goal in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:26:39
God. This place is as bad a r/politics.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:45:06
I mean. They probably think they core is attempting a hostile takeover.  Gotta take both perspectives into account.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:40:09
You even project like r/politics.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:32:03
Yeah. I think I'm moving 60-80% of my holdings to coins with more growth potential. This political crap worries me, and other coins have specific goals and use cases.  Bitcoin devs can't even decide if it's meant to be a store of value or an everyday currency. 
I also think people are going to learn that Bitcoin holdings are totally public record and that will be a bit of a turn off for many use cases.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:32:53
Yeah that's fine, but talking like that is so over the top.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:27:55
Why is madness/dangerous?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:42:49
It's pretty easy, hop on Poloniex and grab a promising alternative while this probable hardfork works itself out.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:15:13
Healthy conversation right here.
No wonder everyone is diversifying.
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:58:47
You expect it to be that rapid?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:06:48
*increased the block size
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:34:56
Yikes. You just keep going.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:35:24
Not really, things turn out to be under or overvalued all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:12:14
Meh.  Would rather use a tried and true system. 
And I say that as a sizable Ether holder.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:22:15
So one transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:04:52
Fungibility tho.
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:30:38
Does it matter?
Has there even been a Litecoin segwit transactions yet?  Nobody is going to use it.

His rallies we orders of magnitude bigger, he gained on minority votes compared to Romney, there were almost no Hillary signs anywhere, very few people had enthusiasm about her, she didn't appear in public much because it seemed to hurt her every time, and polls were predicting a bigger D turnout than Obama got which was basically impossible given the above.  The racism fear mongering shit didn't work as well as planned and they really had no other plan.
She only won the popular vote because of California (make their counts even there and he wins the popular), and I'd bet a lot that if you take out the illegal/non-citizen votes that he'd have more overall.
The Russia thing is pretty clearly false, her campaign started that rumor and got the CIA on board with the absurd '17 intelligence agencies' statement that was referencing a quote that didn't even say what she claimed it did. The FBI has documents out that say they don't know.  It's a continuation of the news attempting to gaslight us.
Also if the FBI didn't push forward it seems like there would have been mass quitting, the were reports of a lot of internal infighting.  Being in intelligence and greenlighting Hillary's mistakes and overall behavior is crazy, not sure how so many seemed to be alright with it all.  Something was going to happen one way or another.
@_date: 2016-12-24 17:06:22
Interesting, but a CIA internal memo isn't enough to convince me. The FBI hasn't publicly changed their stance.
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:56:44
That's not what I'm talking about with the FBI. I was specifically referring to the statement about Russian hacking.
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:13:51
Thanks, kind of both.  I thought that it was pretty close between her being able to rig enough votes to win and him just dominating in swing states.  The evidence of his superior support was everywhere but the media, and the polls were oddly weighted apparently to keep the chosen storyline going.  Silver should have been paying attention to that, it's literally his job, but he seemed content to accept what the polls were predicting regardless.
My betting started off as 'this looks like 50/50 not 20/80' and I slowly became more convinced he was going to win and threw more cash at it over time.  I thought there might be a big bombshell coming that would seal it but it seemed like he had the edge to me even without that.  I could have bet more but I wasn't confident enough once the odds started changing. 
 It was pretty bizarre to believe he was winning while literally everyone around me lived in a totally different reality.
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:52:33
Yup, was weird. I wasn't really happy about the election, slightly relieved, but at least happy about my profits.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:26:23
They had her winning the electoral college vote by a landslide.
@_date: 2016-12-24 18:15:39
Actual evidence would be good. More than the CIA simply telling the media what's up for sure. A publicly released (or FOIA) report would be good like the FBI one I'm referring to. 
If it did turn out to be true, idk what would happen.  Nothing happens when we influence other countries' leadership, what could people even do? 
Honestly I think there's no way it's true. It's too sketchy after Obama and Clinton repeating that you can't rig elections in such a condescending manner. They were trying to get the electoral college to switch based on the foreign influence rumors and it didn't work.
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:38:04
That's a great attitude, I think I'd be a little more bitter.  I was addicted to Wikileaks so it was pretty clear to me how every single news outlet was corrupted, both through direct implication and through the bs stories they were running, so the polls were super suspect.  I lost sleep keeping up, the was too much info to absorb while working full time. I think most people were just too damn busy to stay ahead of it all.
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:46:34
Polls were all shit so we made fun of the pollsters.

@_date: 2016-12-25 17:56:07
Obviously it's not true, but it says something that they completely changed their tune.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:30:30
The FBI published actual documents making definitive statements. The CIA has not, and won't even meet with congress to give them an update on the Russia story (as would be legally required).  There's nothing official coming from the CIA, only news stories.  That's sketchy at best.
I like that I'm getting downvoted despite explaining why I bet the way I did and won. The narrative continues.   
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:13:49
We just went through a huge period of propaganda and media censorship in the US. We're very sensitive to BS like this.  If your answers are better, let them stand on their own and drop the hyperbole and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:31:57
You can mine alts, can even use nicehash and get paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:40:51
Saying 'you' isn't really all that effective, it's puts people on the defensive.
The boomers were as fucked by oligarchy as the millennials.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:45:57
I think the argument is that a big proportion of people see it as the quintessential, most important political issue right now while failing to focus on the even more basic essential rights.  
They're all important, but because gay rights are still in process of being properly implemented, the topic can be viewed as distracting from the subversion of government in general even though it's clearly still important in and of itself.
You could also argue that the attack on abortion rights is a similar distraction, they don't care what it is that's pulling the emotional strings and occupying peoples' minds, as long as the focus isn't on the power grab and erosion of basic rights.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:37:13
That's more Huxleyan.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:20:17
Enjoy being an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:17:42
They've gotta notice now, Bitcoin is about to lose its position at the top, and then what makes it any better than the alternatives?
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:24:11
The big banks are killing Bitcoin with bloat and nonsensical changes that strive to push transactions off chain and into the hands of third parties.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:26:36
It just means they're creating an altcoin.  Bitcoin will still live, and I wish powchangecoin good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:25:04
Get your propaganda straight.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:12:59
Like all altcoins?
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:29:05
No, if it splits the value is going to plummet.  Same if the short chain needs to be killed off.
I don't see these groups reconciling. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:48:22
Oh so you rewrote the white paper?
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:07:17
Yeah except it's useless for normal purchases like buying a coffee or even lunch. The competition is Visa, not ATMs.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:52:03
It's $5 dude. That's outrageous. Many people live on less than that daily.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:12:19
Oh so I disagree with your idiotic logic thus I'm a shill?  This place, man...
That's not even the Stratis sub.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:53:46
I'll take my 20,000% STRAT profits and laugh all the way to the actual usable blockchains, ty.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:53:34
Low fees are worth it since it's all privately controlled by you.  $5, or even $1, fees are absurd. It's broken.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:55:09
Jesus do people actually think this?
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:47:50
I'll happily eat my thousands while they actually get better and grow.  Enjoy the crash as btc gets out competed in every way imaginable.
