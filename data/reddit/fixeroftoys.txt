Yes, but it's worth pointing out corporations are just a line in the tax code and can only exist like they do with government collusion.

The government will always attempt to have more power than the individual citizen, no matter the venue (monetary policy, physical force, etc.). It's not so kooky to point that out.

Polycentric laws?

I would not go so far as to say citizens "generally" trust government more. There's a civil  libertarian streak that runs through both major parties despite their committed race to the polar extremes. While the lowly citizen does commit crimes or mistakes with guns, they are also committed by government employees. There are a mixed bag of statistics to choose from, but GENERALLY speaking the numbers reported are only in support of disarming the citizen. The issue should come down to self ownership, which I think a lot of Bitcoiners can understand.

Is there someplace we can buy a Nexus 5 with BTC?

In that case that word doesn't mean what you think it means.

This is the rhetoric of tyrants, despots, and dictators.

I just read those statutes, it didn't say anything about private couriers, such as FedEx or UPS, it just establishes USPS. I'm not a lawyer, though, so I'm sure I'm missing something.

I've never used, although I figure someday when I retire (and no longer subject to urinalysis) there will be things I want to try.
This was just me wondering if there truly was an anonymous way to do online shopping (like Amazon, although yes, I understand they don't accept BTC right now), and no matter what creative ways I thought of, the mailing address was always the identifiable part of the transaction. Perhaps there's a different way to go about it that someone has thought of.

Can someone please put his Bitcoin prediction next to this?

Fiat money is currency that comes from government regulation. Fiat is Latin and means "let it be done". In other words, it is money by decree. It is oftentimes confused with money that lacks intrinsic value, because fiat usually does lack intrinsic value, too.

In this business model, the closest thing to personally identifiable information of the customer would be the BTC address, unless they were paying for remailing services. I see your point about illicit contents, but I'm sure someone, somewhere has an idea for that?

So, to recap, these folks are anti-Bitcoin:
Any others? Let's consolidate, folks!

Instead of complaining about all the stuff we don't want (most of the stuff doesn't bother me), what kinds of posts do we WANT to see? I see complaints but no solutions.
