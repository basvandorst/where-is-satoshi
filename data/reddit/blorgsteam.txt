Of course. If I were a criminal I would say that too.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:58:41
Too big to ban now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:46:06
Ofc they can't kill it. They can still be a pain to the people who bought btc from the top
If  a few countries ban btc in every possible way there is, it will probably take long years before we see another ATH, now thats pain.

Coinmarketcap proven themselves to be allies of bitcoin.
Great guys.
Edit: it seems they are not that great or Roger paid them off.

I hope they stay offline forever.

There is a hard cap on the tx numbers/day. Bitcoin can't do more than this hard cap.
Naturally, miners choose the txid's with the most fees and those tx's fill the blocks easily. Because of this, no room is left for the cheaper fee tx's.
Even if everybody was paying 1$ as a fee, some tx's still won't get confirmed becaus of this hard cap on tx number/day.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:36:15
Pro tip: read between lines
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:54:01
I know that's the only reason.
They don't give a damn about satoshi or scaling methods. All they want to not lose their mining monopoly.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:48:29
GDAX&amp;Coinbase is Anti-bitcoin.
Do not use anything related to coinbsae. Use a segwit ready exchange. Segwit tx fees are only $1-2. 
Coinbase is ripping its users off and they fund paid shills with that money. That's how r/btc became that big.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:51:02
The Dutch are pro bankers. In a good way. They were seeking a decentralized banking system since the Spanish War and I am pretty sure they'll understand that being decentralized is bitcoin's best feature.

Claiming bcash as the real bitcoin is indeed a fraud.
That's what bitcoin.com is doing. Also makes it unrelated to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:55:34
You are indeed a shill without a clue. This guy you posted is a master shill of bitpay/bitmain/coinbase corporate cartel.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:23:00
How it is about bitcoin while they claim bcash is the real bitcoin?
It does not make a slightest difference even if they were pro bitcoin.
Satoshi was saying bitcoin(dot)com is not related to bitcoin's development. Not just bitcoin. I repeat: "bitcoin's development."
This fact won't change if the owner is Roger or not. (unless its satoshi himself)
The only difference since then is now they are irrelevant to bitcoin and bitcoin's development both.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:04:19
They won't be able to do it because what they copy will only work on segwit which bcash aint got.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:46:26
Bcash also don't have the devs to code a LN without segwit tho.
Its kinda right they won't have LN cuz they aint got no segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:43:40
Bitcoin Core is my  full node client's name.
Bcash is bcash.
And bitcoin is bitcoin. When you say bitcoin everybody knows what you mean except some retards.

Move them to GDAX first. I heard it has cheaper fees.
Moving between CB - GDAX is free.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:02:51

lightning may work w/o segwit but bcash don't have the devs to make it work. no project does probably.
all bcash can do is copy paste core's work nothing else.

Unless you have some mental disability it should be very clear to you what he was speaking about.

An expected answer from a potential criminal. Of course a criminal will say insider trading shouldn't be illegal.
Its like asking pedophiles if the child abuse should be a crime or not. To the them its the most normal thing in the world.

I'll tell the most important thing about the banks first: Fuck em all.
Second point is, you shouldn't have dumped $100k worth of coins at once and try to withdraw them, no matter where you live in but since you live in the US, you should have been double extra careful.
Owning big amounts of bitcoins is another pain. You either spend them without converting to FIAT and that has its own problems or you should convert them slowly. Never all at once.

@_date: 2018-01-07 22:04:11
Maybe it'll happen slowly over time.
Those instant -%30-40 drops were happening in the early days of bitcoin in 2013 and before where many exchanges were being hacked. 
Bitcoin is a lot more widely distributed among people since then. That's why unless someone dumps thousands of bitcoin in a second, we won't see the same stuff again.
If this type of news keep coming though, a slow decrease is still possible. That's usually called: "bear market"

Sorry but i am not using segwit before core implements a GUI. 8% is already pretty high in this regard.
I created a segwit address via electrum a month ago and look what they say about electrum.
Only trusting core and no one else from now on.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:15:53
Gemini don't have segwit or batching yet they are still allies to bitcoin at least unlike conbase. That difference should be enough for people to use gemini.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:17:42
Because they are going to solve it by implementing 2nd layer solutions. Increasing the blocksize leads to centralization which is less important than having a decentralized network.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:53:20
Why downvote this guy he has a point! Every satoshi counts.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:46:33
Interesting I just checked my address in some other block explorer and that explorer does not show my tx.
Out of curiosity i opened my electrum wallet after 1 month and there is no sign of that tx neither.
Blockchain.info on the other hand, still shows that tx as unconfirmed. :/
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:31:36
Satoshis would work too. Now the only thing we need is end user LN wallets and adoption of LN network otherwise it wont make any sense.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:48:18
To keep the blockchain size manageable for everybody through the world.  Security reasons basically.
Not everybody has the best hardware or using the best internet connection to run a node.
Raising the blocksize limit will result in a demand of better hw/internet connection which will lead to centralization of the nodes.
If you observe some bcash shills they have no problem with the node centralization. They are totally ok with $20k servers. Doesn't that somehow feel wrong to you? Don't you wanna be able to run a full node with a minimal investment?
If you can't run a node, how you gonna know if the network rules are functioning or not?
Luckily there are solutions and they are only 1 step away from end users.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:17:50
to scam people? yes.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:19:43

Looking at his message it is not hard to tell.
That domain was irrelevant to bitcoin's development before Roger Ver, and is it relevant now?
Not while they are pushing bcash crap that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:38:46
We are surrounded by enemies
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:19:20
This exactly what's happening right now. I have made a 11sat/byte transaction exactly 1 month ago (the receiving address is also mine) and it is still there on the blockchain.
I never opened electrum in this period. I can make it go through by raising the fee but i am just too stubborn now. It'll either go through with 11sat or come back.
Btw if such an attack was possible, that is a real clusterfuck we are in.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:40:54
ROI is around 10-12 months If you go with cheap seagate drives. 1tb can make $3 in a month. But as you know, it depends on the current network difficulty &amp; BURST price.

@_date: 2018-01-08 13:52:19
Now they are mad because satoshi wasnt approving their .com domain. 
All those satoshi's vision was roger's bull crap.
He was a bitcoin guy because he thought if he collects enough bitcoins, com domain,  bitcoin twitter etc; he could be the bitcoin.
He has no connection left with reality.
He is a sociopath and a very dangerous person.

Hows segwit hurting bitcoin's security? You don't know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:59:28
They are now saying the domain wasn't owned by Roger back then. Like it would make things better.
Fucking shills.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:48:51
No, it still didnt get a confirmation.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:24:07
hot wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:56:17
They need capable devs to run LN without segwit which they aint got.
Since they dont have any capable devs they'll need segwit to run LN again they refuse to implement.
So, they won't have LN cuz they won't have segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:22:24
Still better than conbase
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:07:26
Why dont you go back to rbtc and eat rogers ass?

He wasnt crying. He was acting. There is a big difference. That dude has no feelings or whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:49:22
They've been lying since the very beginning.
Satoshi was clearly against this clown if you check his posts on bitcointalk but it doesn't even matter now. He is gone.
This shit heads are using his name to shield their scam. Satoshi's vision is bitcoin, it never was bcash
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:48:34
Without PoW its just a shitty ICO/Ponzi.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:36:03
Basically LN will replace bitpay, and altcoins...
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:14:44
Your main failure is not borrowing money. When you borrow money people calculate the risks and only after give it to you.
But when you merged other people's coins in your own wallet, now that's fucked up.
If your boss is too lazy to create a bitcoin wallet and buy it himself, he doesn't deserve to own them.
I know you wanted to be a good guy to your boss but...mistake is a mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:11
So if satoshi knew who Ver was, his opinion would change? You think he would like the guy? lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:02
Their views on the subject are unrelated to bitcoin's development. Whoever the owner is doesnt change that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:13:58
Doesn't matter. I'm not selling a satoshi. I can buy theirs tho. Keep em coming bcash fans.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:58:03

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:11:16
wow now i see why he tells that btc is going to be 1m$ but the next day he says bcash will recplace bitcoin. (side note, vinny asked him on twitter, if hes talking about bcash or bitcoin. he made it clear that it was bitcoin he was talking about)
first one is probably what he believes, second one is probably cuz he's getting paid.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:32:36
Wut great news!
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:18:36
I am no way fine with %50. That's not tax, that's thievery.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:19:46
Unless you catch a good deal (which is very unlikely) and the seller is nearby (not dealing with customs and shit) mining is pointless.
Otherwise its a cool thing. Not just because you make money out of mining but you'll also be protecting your own bitcoin investments by running one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:33:05
Bcash is pure scam isnt that obvious to you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:28:46
He was saying to not use it till LN arrives. Since LN has arrived, we can use segwit now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:49:11
He feels very insecure indeed.

He was just thinking about the possibilities. Block size increase can be done when it is safe to do. Nobody is against it.
satoshi was against that clown which is Roger Ver which is the main pusher for this block size increase.
and he is unrelated to bitcoin's development. He is only a lucky early investor, nothing else. Hear it from satoshi himself:


Sorry but bcash, bitcoin.com, roger ver and the other clowns are unrelated to bitcoin. They are bcash fans now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:17:28
IOTA has a shady distribution scheme which nobody knows how they do it. Since there is no mining with IOTA, how did they distribute it? I'll tell you. Devs are the bagholders and they distributed it among the people they like. Can you see the problem?
Ripple... This shit aint even crypto. It is a token of Ripple corp which they can print any of them at any time out of thin air. They did it before, they'll do it again. Search it on google and coinmarkecap. They add new tokens and raise their marketcap from time to time. Pure scam.

Actually even 20% is too much for the low earners. I was trying to get a number for an average earner.
10% would be fine for low earners.

20% isnt bad cmon. 4 for me 1 for the gov.
What govs want is; one for the gov and one for you pretty much. Like being a partner to your business.
When you go %50 that means you work for the gov not the other way around.
%20 is pretty much acceptable to me.

If btc fails its pretty much done.
Sure we can bounce to the next best thing for a few times but not many will be following. Even if we find our next bitcoin, they'll destroy it too. There will be chaos. There are already many fake satoshis around imagine what'll happen after bitcoin dies...
Bitcoin dies = pretty much over
Do it once, make it invincible. We either win or lose, there is no middle ground.

Not everybody lives in the US and can get their hands on a S9 easily. To me, trying to buy a miner is a lot more painful act than buying bitcoins from where i sit.
I made x15 since the last year just by holding. Not enough to reach my goal but its better than nothing ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:37:53
Is it a coincidence all the famous bcash promoters are either criminals or frauds? 
Roger, bcash scammer, went to prison before.
Craig; a liar and many other shady stuff.
McAffee; accused of murdering his neighbor.
Jihan; asicboost&amp;antbleed
Armstrong; insider trading, b2x shill
Cnbc; corrupted media.
The list goes on.
It is like wherever a scumbag lives in the world, he/she somehow joins the bcash wagon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:26:29
Bcash, bitcoin unlimited, classic, b2x are all the same thing. Yes this attack was on the table since the beginning.
It only changes name when it fails and comes back again later.

Taxes are fine. 
As long as the amounts are reasonable and scalable between the rich and the poor.
There is absolutely zero reason for you to run away from it.
I would gladly pay 20% income taxes without a second thought. Anything over this will make me think.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:40:17
they will accept bitcoin because of LN...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:17:24
People are panicking because its not 30k$ already since the last ATH.
People want 1k$ raise everyday now. I know its madness.
Long time bitcoiners are just buying the dip because they saw this before. They saw people who bought btc from 1200$ in 2013. It took 4 years to get back to that price.
agreed with the rest, coinbase&amp;bcash is no bigger than bitcoin at all. they are a sand particle near bitcoin. I accept they do exist tho. Nothing to worry.

I cant check this address' balance on blockchain.info but can do it on btc.com just found out.
Interestingly, btc.com shows me a different address which starts with 1 after i hit enter.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:55:47
But then how will the central authority find money for all those stuff? Free healthcare/roads/hospitals/schools? 
These won't happen by themselves and I don't think many people will be volunteer to build them without the Gov forcing us to pay for them.
Any solution?
Many healthy people I know wouldn't pay for the Health Insurance if the Gov wasn't forcing them because they think they'll stay healthy forever till they don't. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:40:38

You are clearly misinformed.
LN doesn't remove the available of onchain transactions. In fact it enables more room for it.
On the other hand big blocks lead to node centralization which is exactly what paypal is. That's what bcash wants to be.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:43:19

I tried to explain this before in this sub but not everybody got it. This dude is nuts, a sociopath and very unreliable.
Even if it surpasses bitcoin's market  cap, "his project" will always stay as bcash to me and many others.
Why would i invest in something i hate so much? Doesn't make sense. So i dumped all my bcash on 1st August.
Fuck his money, fuck his project, fuck him.

**Copy pasting my last message in the end of the discussion to here, so you won't be able to deceive lazy newbies.**
**This dude says full nodes provide no security to the network. And here is my final response down below:**
How about taking a look at the bitcoin wiki and educate yourself about full nodes rather than copy/pasting irrelevant parts of the white paper?
"Security: All these checks done by full nodes also increase the security. There are many attacks possible against lightweight wallets that do not affect full node wallets."
"Security: Lightweight nodes are sometimes able to be temporarily tricked into accepting transactions or blocks that are not actually valid. This could cause serious financial damage, especially for websites that automatically process Bitcoin transactions. Full nodes provide the maximum security possible, and so they should be used by all businesses, and also by regular users whenever doing so is convenient."
**Hows that full nodes aint provide no security again? Explain further. Rekt mate. Go back to school now. (don't forget to delete your ruined reddit acc first)**

You are clearly misinformed.
Nodes are not going to accept 2 competing chains. They only accept the chain which abides the  network rules. Not the other one.
If they were to accept 2 chains at once, nothing would be able to distinguish bcash from bitcoin.
Haven't you learn anything from the past UASF thing? That was a great opportunity to educate yourself.
My full node don't accept any blocks from bcash (or 2x if it was a thing) right now. Because it is set to accept blocks only from the bitcoin chain.

By buying bcash, you are playing their game.
Bcash is their game not yours. You buy it to increase your btc number but you are playing their game. When you play their game, you won't be the winner.

The main problem is CEO of bcash owns bitcoin.com which can be used to deceive people (and he is doing it already)
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:03:06
You sound very confused. Which "both chains" are you talking about? As long as they abide the same rules, no matter how many different miners there are, they mine the same chain. So there ain't no 2 chains anywhere. It is the one and the only.

Every alt is faster than btc since they only have a fraction of bitcoin's userbase.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:41:00
Selling from the bottom price... You just did what bcash owners wanted...
Everbody here told us sell immediately from the high prices or don't sell and wait till the price gets high.
If you couldn't follow/understand this simple logic its not our fault.
You can't even differ a shit sub like rbtc from this one. I say you had it coming. Go now. Go to rbtc. Seems like it wasn't enough already.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:57:27

@_date: 2017-11-24 08:38:34
I had my chances to rebuy from the point i sold but i didn't. You know why? Because i just don't want to touch it. I don't care about profits coming from a corrupted currency promoted by scammers.
It is like gambling. You win win win and when you lose, you are fucked.
It is the same with bcash. It is all fun and games until Roger decides to bleed you dry.
On the other hand I hold every other bitcoin fork there is. (including gold/bitcore and many others)

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:16:20
One of them is being favored by a convicted criminal (roger), a satoshi imposter (Craig) and a mining monopoly owner (jihan) = fraud.
Bcash is not bitcoins twin. It is a pump and dump scam coin with shit sauce on top.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:17:38
They are. As long as they use their own full nodes for their transactions.
If you let somebody else to broadcast/confirm your transaction, you are just a user. Somebody else is the peer/node.

I ended up just like you a year ago.
Even the amounts are almost the same;) long story short; now i never touch my bitcoin holdings but from here and there if i manage to get some altcoins, i still dont dump em away instantly but wait till they make a big pump. Then i convert them to bitcoins. Sometimes they go even higher after i dump but that's not important since i already made the decision and got my bitcoins. Worked for me since last year.
P.S. I don't buy alts. Only collect them from free giveaways.

He might go back in jail soon.
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:49:57
I'll defend bitcoin against Vermins till i give my last breath.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:44:59
World ends.
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:30:54
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:34:32
Nope, you are not that. I know it because am a person with some decent critical thinking and in the light of my past experiences, I can tell that you are a bcash sockpuppet.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:36:10
Will you come back and make crypto great again?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:24:13
One other thing, he gets mad when people use bcash but he keeps using "bitcoin core" when calling bitcoin.
A person like Samson (same goes for Jameson and Adam) will never get down to his level and call "his project" bcash.
We need more people like Carvalho.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:44:56
Did you call my name?
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:46:52
When he was asked directly about bcash numerous times, he said that he didn't know about his existence till the last minute before the release. As you know he was lying as he always does.
In that particular live debate however (when he accepted bcash is his project) the interviewer made him so mad, he couldn't lie anymore and showed his true form because he lost self control. True fucking honest fraudster form of Ver.
Lying is a serious job bro. You can't just get mad and be honest. He needs to have some discipline, work ethics.
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:05:17
I thought he had satoshi's(!) vision :/
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:26:20
This is HUGE
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:21:08
Bcash is BCC. True vision of Bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:02:34
He was always greedy and selfish. He was just using bitcoin for his own agenda. When bitcoin community decided to move in a different direction than his interests, he became hostile.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:34:58
He didn't say it that way. He clearly said it as he owns the project.
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:28:38
Doge is a legit joke unlike bcash which is a bad joke.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:01:04
Bcash isn't a side. It's an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:28:29
He is a pussy. One good slap in the face is all he needs.

Then be smart. Don't let if catch fire. Or make multiple copies. Seeds are ok too.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:02:19
He is a spy
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:38:03
WoW what a mess.
They are Bcash fans in rBTC sub while the exchanges call it BCC but rbtc community call it BCH while calling BTC, bcore.
I think they need a doctor.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:23:02
They are shitting bricks because of fear
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:15:14
No, when you are ready, markets won't have to.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:11:20
Did you just say "Ver"? Then you must include Wright too.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:29:29
In other words, nobody gives a fuck about bcash.
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:03:34
tell this to btc-e.com
USA practically owns every .com domain there is.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:33:30
I remember he said some stuff about kids not long ago
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:44:20
They don't live?
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:46:53
He is mentally handicapped.
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:33:44
Who needs electricity while you can have naked girls, sea and sausages?
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:17:35
I think I just saw a bcash sockpuppet.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:07:15
Maybe they are "testing" their new miners, s11?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:58:14
Because they are junkies who are addicted to bcash.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:54:07
Waaaay more than enough to handle a clown parrot.
I am not saying Samson or Adam is dumber/less educated than Ver. 
Ver just knows how to talk his random bullshit non-stop and confuses anyone in front of him.
Jameson knows how to stay on topic and separate bullshit from real talk. (Roger has little to none.)
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:45:41
They used to cost around $2.5k but I am pretty sure they'll adjust the prices to a lower lvl considering both Canaan and Bitmain did it.


What's that mean? If you are asking Halong's specs, it should be around that yes.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:29:10
These aren't on a live debate.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:39:52
I am glad I've never made any purchases from them.
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:52:13
You sound dumb
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:42:29
He can always ask for a "trial by combat"
Worked well for the imp
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:21:51
Another article seeks for a new bitcoin among shitcoins. Why are they so dumb? LTC don't have to become bitcoin because we already have bitcoin...

Well that's true too.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:16:36
Bitpay is one of those scam companies.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:34:47
Bcash people/Roger are keeping him alive. CSW is as fraud as Roger Ver. That's why he is going nowhere.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:42:21
Give it time
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:59:35
Both suck tbh.
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:35:06
Not everybody is a cow.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:24:05
How many devs do bcash have again?
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:38:29
Same here.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:41:08
Sold already to some bcash shill sorry.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:28:58
That's not a real lambo! Thats Lambo Cash, true vision of Ferrari.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:42:29
Why can't this fucktard focus on his shitcoin instead of attacking bitcoin like a mad dog?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:39:26
Wow You are a hardcore bcash fan aint you?
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:40:15
What is dead may never die. Amen.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:20:28
Still very close to be the first xd
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:37:48
Bitcoin has more than 100 contributors all over the world. How many devs bcash has again?
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:41:51
 Bcash wouldn't have existed if we were. Those were the times bruh. I wish there was a parallel universe without any Roger Vers or Jihan Wus.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:45:27
But babies????
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:54:35
They also said a solution like lightning network can change everything. Which coin has LN again?
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:34:26
I am trying to tell you, when you are ready... I won't have to.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:32:24
Yeah. Fuck third parties. (Especially bitpay)
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:21:31
This is just the beginning. It'll get bigger. A lot bigger.
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:43:23
I am voting with my money. Hopefully these will kill shitmain.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:04:14
Jameson Lopp is very good at countering Roger's bullshit I think.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:20:41
Bcash gang will do it to anyone. Tbh, it is impossible to win a debate against Roger. Because he won't accept it no matter what you do.
To win, all we need to do it stay calm, point out his bullshit - that's the most important part, even Jameson skips it - and keep talking sense.
If a person gets confused by Roger Ver, it is already over. Need to stay awake. 
John Carvalho did an excellent job against him and probably even better suited for the job. He got down to his language level and Roger got so mad he didn't have other choice but quit.
That my friend was a solid "WIN".
There is no other way against him.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:08:05
It is probably China. He already left the US for good.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:53:31
Nice ride.
@_date: 2018-04-07 08:07:27
This looks like my room
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:27:31
Roger wants go to jail so bad. (Again)
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:35:41
He clearly said Bcash is "his project" on a live debate.

You should have backed up your private keys only instead of doing complicated stuff.
