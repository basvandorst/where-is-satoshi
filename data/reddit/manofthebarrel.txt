LocalBitcoins or a buddy.  That’s about it.

For all their faults, GDAX/CB is still more reliable than the others, IMO.  And they have a *lot* of faults.

I’m been short on that coin for like a year.

I closed my account after a month waiting.  If you didn’t get in back in September, idk how it’s ever gonna happen.  Kraken is *still* locked down, and so is Bitstamp (although you can still *try* on Bitstamp, but your proof of residence will always get denied...)

Doesn't BitPay convert to fiat at point-of-sale?

How about they start by accepting it without BitPay?  That’s a start and a finish.

Yeah, I’m not sure why no one is picking up on the possibility that a 3 day old account with Bitconnect in the username posting probably the dumbest thing anyone’s ever heard is trolling...

Glad I hit refresh before replying, since slow and steady weren’t in the original comment.
I agree.  Slow and steady is the stated agenda.  But my point is that slow and steady isn’t always possible politically during a sharp, sudden contraction.
Also, as wage growth slows and efficiency increases, it becomes harder and harder to get it to - and keep it at - the Fed’s benchmark rate.
Look at Europe.  Are there even *hints* of the ECB raising rates?  Not that I know of...

Which means there is almost always a currency supply deficit that depends on inflation to keep the circulation going.  This is what everyone continues to forget.  As soon as deflation picks up or credit markets freeze, that deficit requires injections and depressed interest rates from central banks for that vital inflationary pressure.  Cycle after cycle after cycle after cycle...
HODL gold.  HODL crypto.  Over time, fiat and the fractional reserve banking system will dance themselves into exhaustion.  It’s not going to collapse dramatically like some people think.  The important thing is to *teach* people that an *alternative* exists so they can *transition*.
