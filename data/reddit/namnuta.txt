Some like MT.Gox maybe having issues. But calling all exchanges a scam?? I get deposits from Virtex (The Canadian exchange) is 24 hours. And i am talking large volumes. Not all exchanges are created equal. 
To the OP. Its called arbitrage trading and its very lucrative if you can move funds around quick enough or have a very large portfolio. MT.GOX has been higher for months, because its a pain to get CAD or USD out of them.

Some issues with nxtcoin though is that the IPO was suddenly closed. only 71, with many more that wanted to get in and had the funds to do so. 
Starting off life this makes everyone feel its a scam. If it was a free market IPO then fine. But it wasn't.

It's a reporter. They all have there own agenda. That's why reddit is a great place. The real news can flow and reporters can be called out for there lies and manipulation. Yes I am biased as I feel journalists are worse than personal injury lawyers. We'll some, or most are the lowest form of life.

No. Virtex is a trusted exchange imo. 24 hour bank deposits, etc.
