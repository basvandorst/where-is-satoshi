We all still need fiat to pay bills (well, most of us, for now), everything else goes in the bitcoin "savings account." The interest rates are much better than any bank.
Just wait for the coming hyperinflation- a minimal BTC withdrawal will pay off that fiat mortgage like a joke.

emerging generations have less and less demand for gold. Less demand --&gt; lower price. The internet continues to erode centuries of stability. As long as an EMP doesn't wipe out global infrastructure, crypto will continue to eat the precious metal market cap.

It's only on one exchange because it's an entirely new type of cryptocurrency. The Tangle isn't the blockchain, and so it's a lot harder to incorporate into exchanges than a traditional blockchain crypto. Bittrex is currently working to incorporate it; not sure about others. Byteball (also tangle) is already on Bittrex, so idk how different the two are or what work is required to get IOTA in there.


Most people who want them can't buy them due to point 1.


Totally possible- will have to research their ICO distribution vs total supply. Agreed this isn't awesome.


It was publicized, but not handy-wavy like every moon kid with a crypto project. I grow weary any time devs come under a windfall of cash thanks to initial fundraising, and then fuck off to a private island. 500 BTC is a drop compared to recent ETH ICOs. Still, your previous point would allow said devs to fuck off to said islands- as short-sighted as that would be.
Bitfinex and their potential USDT-BTC margin scam does scare the shit out of me, admittedly, and it's totally possible the IOTA price is a reflection of that manipulation. Not really sure, TBH. The links you provided definitely raise eyebrows, while also containing pretty standard FUD- will have to dig deeper into them later. Thank you for taking the time to thoughtfully reply.

You're funny. The hoards of HODLers are why the price keeps getting driven up- you should be thanking them. We're in the market adoption phase, and will be for the conceivable future- so use case stagnation isn't really a problem, and won't be for a while. Using crypto in general over fiat is good because every transaction takes power away from banks, but there are better cryptos to use for day-to-day spending (LTC, for example). BTC's value growth against USD is just too damn high to trade it for anything else.
I'm not spending my BTC until I can buy a substantial swath of land with it, and exit this slave economy entirely. Fuck a lambo, and especially fuck a steam game.

We're in a speculative phase. It's going to stay that way until we get into early adoption, which at earliest will be sometime next year. I'm speculatively holding my investments until speculation evens out (which will likely happen after crypto cannibalizes fiat and causes hyperinflation)- you do you.

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:24:52
Yeah, it would definitely fuck shit up for the short term, but we have to remember that crypto is eating fiat alive. The only countries actively fighting crypto are the countries with massively inflated, leveraged, manipulated fiat-- their money is already hanging on by a thread. We'll reach a point where their money won't be worth enough for them to carry on their tyrannical bullshit. Cops aren't going to be kicking down doors when they're burning their paychecks as fire wood. Maybe I'm an optimistic retard, but we live in very strange times with extremely disruptive technology-- gotta take in a lot of variables. It won't be as easy for them to mandate workable bans as it may initially seem.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:28:15
Totally agree with every point you're making. However, keep in mind that if governments actually did what they claim to do, cryptocurrency would have never been born in the first place. Bitcoin was forged in the fires of the 2008 housing crisis, which was created due to shitty government/banking regulation--- we didn't ask for this. This movement is an adaptation to our own governments' continued and relentless monetary policy failures. Even if BTC didn't exist, fiat will still fail (BTC's just helping move the inevitable along at the moment). Even if there were no exchanges to ban, our dollars will still soon-enough be as worthless as firewood.
Those bans will only work as long as the offending governments have the fiat to pay their goons to enforce it. That fiat will fail, and then so will their ability to enforce the ban (and before anyone cries "govcoin"-- that'll still be inflationary fiat wrought with the same issues federal reserve notes suffer today; it'll be a 1:1 shit swap that'll change nothing- don't mistake govcoin for the immutable BTC protocol). The value of crypto may suffer in the interim-- but won't totally fail, as plenty of people will successfully circumvent the system (keep in mind we're still at the lunatic fringe now; most people using this stuff are technologically savvy-enough to figure something out, or know someone who is)- further putting a hurting on the already strained system. The people with the profound ability to affect the world around us will still be using crypto.
So, fast-forward to the part where the world is on fire because our economic engine's oil never got changed, and you have a technological Jesus that can come and fix all of our woes-- Blockchain (presumably BTC in this case). Blockchain will then come around and rule the world, and governments will never be the same again, if they exist at all ("geez, what a pie-in-the-sky idiot this kid is").
I'm not saying it'll be so simple or straightforward as what I've described above, I'm merely arguing that this technology is vastly more powerful than anything our governments were ever equipped to deal with- especially after the way they've so recklessly/intentionally destroyed our current medium of exchange. If you fear you'll be cut out from using crypto in the future, I highly recommend hedging into precious metals; they'll make a rockin-awesome safe haven until our tyrannical governments finally fucking suffocate.
Never accept their compromises. Fight these evil bastards any way you can. It's the only chance your children have at a free future. We're closer than most realize. We live in truly incredible times.

Crypto isn't and won't ever be banned- governments have no power to ban crypto; they only have the ability to ban/regulate centralized exchanges, and prevent those exchanges from carrying certain coins. Decentralized exchanges will literally make them powerless to regulate anything other than the gatekeepers of fiat to crypto.
Edit: to add, for the "what about when they ban the gate keepers?" -- Simple: black market. How's the drug war working out for the feds? When TPTB prohibit something with demand, people always find a workaround. Always.

And why would they lock someone in a cage for lying about income? Taxation. Not seeing your point about naive dumbshit when you're splitting hairs so thin you miss the forest for the trees.
I love this line of thinking that the government is the only entity that can keep us safe, when it's proven to be completely inept in accomplishing anything else compared to the free market. The very entity that you claim keeps everyone so safe is the same entity that will lock you in a cage for nonviolent activities, and has the largest track record of doing so of any government in world history. Don't even get me started on how it responsibly uses tax dollars to spread democracy. Man, what peace-keepers.
I support the idea of allocating defense (who wouldn't?), but to hand the golden ticket to a group of thugs with a proven track record of corruption and thirst for power, and then defend their stealing of earnings under the threat of force is just silly, in my opinion.
