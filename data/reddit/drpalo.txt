I use it every day.. for saving. When the next crash comes (and it's overdue) I believe my savings will be safer than in a bank. We'll see if that belief is correct.
I do spend bitcoins online when I want privacy and for the nerd buzz eg paying for vpn subscription but this is quite rare.

The triggers for bitcoins growth have been serious failures of fiat like bailouts, capital controls, defaults and hyperinflation.
In these scenarios how would a bank coin be more attractive to people than bitcoin.

Yeah thats how I see it - its like they are just interested in the buzzword to get boost share prices and seem on top of things.
Currently as a cheque or online payment goes from bank A to bank B how does bank A settle with bank B? I figured they just take a few days to make sure that bank A has the money in that account. 
They can make a system much faster than that without being distributed or trustless, and it will seem to an end user just as good as the Bitcoin blockchain until one of the bank cheats.

Actually it makes sense from a currency perspective vs euro otherwise foreigners will open sterling accounts to avail of the UK guarantee which is now way higher than Euro banks guarantee. 
But then if foreigners all bring their money then banks are better capitalized so a bailin is less likely..

Volatility is a big barrier to adoption, stopping ordinary people from accepting Bitcoin for goods or labour.  The ability to 'switch off' volatility would be a step forward for the currency. 
Taking it further,  if a tool allowed you to set your volatility tolerance as a percentage, Id could see myself finding it useful.

I was thinking about exactly this as I'm a European in the states on holiday this week.. 
Tipping is kind of alien to us and a bit annoying how often it has to be done when staying in a hotel. I thought this would be a great way to tip people and simultaneously get people interested in bitcoin.  Eg "Here's a piece of paper with a bitcoin tip of $5/$10/$20 etc"
They'd have to trust you on the keys being legit and not copied but hey it's a tip so technically you dont have to give them anything.  They'd remember a fake tip just like a bad tip.

Because not everything adjusts at equal pace. Food might deflate but property stays high for a while so the right to access to property in exchange for your labour is stolen but not the right for access to change food for your labour. Its still theft.. Plus the inflation figures are nonsense nobody knows what real inflation is they are very easy to manipulate.

Oil is required for everything, food to fuel. When oil gets too cheap it's no longer affordable/profitable to find and pump it out, the only way to do it is with credit, for a loss, which pretty much all producers are doing now, and going into more debt. When credit runs out what happens? Who is the money owed to? Will there be no oil? Will prices go back up? Will Oil be sold for gold only? Will food supplies suffer? Will the caped crusader save us?! Find out next time same time, same bat channel.

Exactly, internationally synchronised regulation is not happening. See tax havens.

By making rates lower it means saving money is no better than just spending it. In other words its forcing people to live under unnatural rules. 
What is worth more to you :  I give you £10 today or £10 in a year? £10 today is more useful to you because you don't have to wait. So people who lend their money to others who want it today should be rewarded for waiting to get it back and risking possibly not getting it back.. aka saving. That reward is called interest. When it is mandated centrally that the interest rates are lower than they've traditionally been (about 6% on average) it fucks savers. Eg the elderly and those with pensions and those who chose to go without to save for something later. 
Savers are being stolen from to give to spenders. Central banks want spenders because they hope they will get the economy going. They will until they won't. 
Inflation is not negative now. Oil has deflated in price but deflation is not happening yet for rents food house prices and everything that matters especially when compared to wage inflation.  Inflation is targeted at 2% by central banks but it's just under that in US and Europe. Inflation is theft of purchasing power for your stored labour.  Deflation is the opposite.

To be fair it's not every transaction that upsets &gt;51% of miners. It's the few transactions that &gt;51% are so pissed off with they are prepared to lose feed from the blocks they reversed.
It's not gonna be a daily, nay even multi yearly event. Or the miners would progressively weaken the value of their product.

YOU presumably know:
World debt is 200trillion GDP is only 60 trillion. 80 individuals own half the world's 'wealth' and 6 people own half US 'wealth'.
Debt and stealth tax (inflation) keeps the poor poorer. Bitcoin aims to target this and will continue to be even more evenly distributed than fiat as your feared early adopters cash out.

Wow even if you are not money laundering? Surely it's not illegal to have some and this is just an attempt to scare people off. Sounds like its working. 
It would be easy not to get caught if you used a paper wallet. You could omit or change a few characters(after memorizing the changes!) You could also keep two halves of the address and or keys in different locations. Who can prove a list of numbers and letters written on a page is bitcoin?

Very scary rhetoric. In decades gone by intellectuals were rounded up for their opinions and the threat they posed to authoritarian rulers. 
Now it seems if you use PS4, encryption, bitcoin or cash it will be easy to justify your demonization to the xfactor watching masses. Am I being too tinfoil hat? Can't figure out why else such patently incorrect conclusions are being publicly jumped to. 
I understand never let a crisis go to waste, but the sudden ratcheting up of terror threats and linking these privacy tools to terrorism is hard to read as just stupidity.
TL:DR; using bitcoin, encryption, cash, tor or PS4? Being accused of (and believed to) being a terrorist is now a more legitimate risk.

VISA handles on average around 2,000 transactions per second (tps), so call it a daily peak rate of 4,000 tps. It has a peak capacity of around 47,000 transactions per second, however they never actually use more than about a third of this even during peak shopping periods. [1]
PayPal, in contrast, handles around 10 million transactions per day for an average of 115 tps. [2]

Ireland's answer:
I remember my disgust at the thought of slowing internet connection "at no extra charge"
Getting paid (&amp; in bitcoin) makes the transaction palatable provided there is no risk of jail time for the few satoshis. 
As for end users, we don't care until we need free wifi and we don't need it until we change our routine.
Could help pay the silly rents in crowded cities that tourists enjoy visiting, not so much everyday people though.

@_date: 2015-02-12 19:56:25
I was surpised by this myself, everyone quotes 75,000 tps
If visa has 1,500,000,000 cards in circulation and practically only uses 2000 tps average, that means their network needs 1tps per 750,000 cards.  
Presumably bitcoin could be useful at 3 tps for just over 2,000,000 users?
