Would you call wasting energy mining gold to sit in a bank vault is tantamount to the same waste as mining bitcoins?, if you do then you don’t have an argument, BTC is moving as fast as is possible to renewable sources of power, sure it will take time but in that time there is no reason why it can’t become solely run on renewables, that isn’t what I’d call waste I would call it advancement.
I don’t get your mentality of this “BE WORTH MORE IN THE FUTURE” you’ve lost me with flawed logic.
Mutual funds,
Precious metals,
And any other finite supply that has battled to gain a consensus of value.
Your making out that wanting profit via speculation is bad and a road to ruin, when most people on earth only have wealth because they’ve in some way speculated throughout their lives.
Welcome to planet earth my friend ��.
I must also add that I don’t think you understand liquidity in a market either and the importance over the long term, the more money enters a market through speculation the higher the price of the asset will rise, in the long term this lowers volatility making the asset less liable to trading and making its value more stable.
For the above reason one day BTC can indeed have a stable value with far less volatility.
Early days and baby steps.
Also you mentioned earlier BTC gains no value from mining production which is wrong as you e mentioned you like precious metals like gold, you should then realise production cost is transferred into value per ounce, I believe it costs about $300 dollars to mine an ounce of gold this cost is passed onto the purchaser, the rest of golds value is made up of varying other market forces.
So when a Bitcoin is mined it’s power consumption is also marked into its overall value, this is simple mining profitability.

I agree with your comments, and I don’t believe they can destroy BTC directly but the Americans are sure rattled about the dollar losing its footing as the worlds reserve currency.
Moreover this guys speech today shows or should show everyone how free you are not, as clearly they want control over crypto whether it be Bitcoin or other or Libra.
I don’t think anyone can stop money laundering and illicit activity “either in traditional fiat markets or crypto markets”, but the problem is they won’t ban or try to ban fiat markets, they will however maybe pass laws to outlaw the use of bitcoins and other.
I know this is a decentralised system and the mining is spread globally, but what if all countries agreed that they would go after all mining facilities, of course mining could go back to a network of smaller home computers and eventually still have great security.
I’m just wondering if we are getting to the point where they unbeknown are on the verge of forcing BTC and the like underground?.
What’s your view.

Criminality is often not recognised until the deals already done IMO, apart from hacking of Bitcoins which is obvious.
How many people have an account flagged but are completely innocent of any wrong doing, and on the other hand how many criminal transactions go through ��‍♂️, the answer no one knows, if millions is sent via Bitcoin is that a wealthy person or a criminal �� who decides and how do they know they’re right, they don’t is the simple answer.
And this is the same with the banks around the world, some transactions and accounts are criminally linked, you cannot ever stop criminality and the tools they will use are everywhere and they will use everyone.

The irony is that fighting BTCs network is futile, “BUT” their own fiat network globally is in a bad state and BTC only has to sit back in the long term to succeed, as the onus is on them to make their system workable again and their debt makes that impossible.

Hey thanks for these links, I’m more interested in security now than i ever have been thanks to the info you’ve sent me, these thinks combined are the way forward for me for sure.
I only have one more question, when you use a more secure email like these ones can a company tell it’s a throw away one when you register for something, or are they indistinguishable from any normal on view so to speak email addresses?.
As often you have to confirm your email for an account.

Urrrrr, it’s not comparing you are, it’s saying your account can be hacked through a Visa card for far more than the £30 limit, what don’t you understand.
FFS as I’ve just explained to you the fraud is perpetrated through visa.
Bitcoin has no fraud, as the TXs are verified on the Blockchain.
And if you don’t think QE is fraud, or spurring higher inflation by any means is also fraud I couldn’t be bothered to convince you.

@_date: 2019-07-23 15:58:05
 If at all if you don’t understand the reasons you’ve already been given then there really is no point in continuing trying to show you.
And yet again your argument is based on what might happen and not what is happening.
I mean geez think about what you’re saying, your basic argument is Bitcoin is worthless in the future because of thing in the past  that have also lost market share.
This isn’t proof for any crystal ball metrics you’re trying to imply.
Your argument gets even more foolish the more you carry on, even if BTC lost its dominance in the future that doesn’t mean it becomes worthless.
You seem like the kind of person who’s sad he’s missed the boat, I know you’ll argue different but the returns off BTC and other crypto are real you only need look at its parabolic rise from 0 to one dollar and beyond.
Personally I don’t care who owns it.

So if competition lowers price how do you explain Bitcoins dominance in a market with over 3500 crypto tokens ��‍♂️?.
I mean what are these so called token that are going to topple BTC waiting for?.
Competition won’t lower BTCs price because it’s a limited supply of 21 million and regardless of what ever shit coins come to market they are not and have not succeeded in taking away its market dominance, would you like source material?.
Actually your not correct in all you say either about precious metals, the gold market is a highly manipulated market and it’s manipulated by mining companies, I assure you if they want to put more gold out into the market they can simply by increasing mining production, here is another reason you miss for BTCs value it isn’t possible to speed up mining as the algorithm is set by difficulty.
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:47:21
Fiat currency or government backed and issued currencies are not forceable by law upon to their citizens.
I believe “quote me if I am wrong” that a currency being formerly issue by government does in no respect mean “I or you or any member of the populous” is bound by law to have to use it, they can use what payment they like if enough people assign value to it and it is accepted as payment.
I also do not believe in law the governments can force the population to use their chosen means of fiat currency, as it would be against civil liberties and against human freedom.
The only reason fiat is and has been used is because they had no one as smart as satoshi to recreate a none cheat-able system, like the one Bitcoin for-fills, manipulated fiat systems only benefit governments that cannot control budget spending.
Death to fiat!!!!.

That’s not a double spend ��, do you really know how a blockchain works? NO CLEARLY.
You cannot double spend on a Blockchain like Bitcoins unless you own more than 51% of the hash rate, that’s what block verification is.

If there was a double spend you fool on the BTC network all faith would be lost and potentially BTC would be finished.

The Ledger as you know is a cold storage wallet with the private key stored on a secure chip, as I’ve just been told it can’t be compromised “which is what I asked originally as wasabi wallet has a pairing function”.
Wasabi runs on TOR so is decentralised and more private and I think one huge benefit is its coinjoin facility.

I hope you make enough out of BTC to buy cash, that way you’ll avoid the huge interest payments mortgages saddle you with.

I would consider what you are  saying to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for arguments sake.
Honey badger bitcoin is a third party ATM provider firstly, also it seems if zero confirmations were needed they deserved to be robbed, or for that matter any one else who did the zero confirmation thing.
If a system is set up to require confirmations for security then with them it’s secure.
Either way I’d say visas gapping hole hack is way more serious, and I stand by what I said as I was talking about BTC transaction with confirmations .
I would also consider fiat monies to have far more fraud than even visa overall.

Here is a phycological process that makes shit coins “SHIT COIN”, you see as humans are greedy they assign false value in many ways but as for shit coins the process is easily explained “ if you look in a wallet and you have say 30 shit coin”, you automatically believe you’re  better off than say having 0.0001111 of a Bitcoin “let’s say it just looks better” but value in those 30 shit coins is virtually worthless for the reasons I’ve explained earlier.
Cheap entry point is a misguided failure.
When these people and shit coins eventually start losing more and more value these people will convert over into BTC, if you add up all their value then you’ll realise that BTCs price yet again will be on a win win, no ones saying Ripple or etheruem or Litecoin or maybe a few more are going to die as the market has room for a varied basket of crypto coins as long as they have network security and utility.
Just sit back and watch over the next 2 years and beyond.

Thanks for the reply, I see from the link it is dependent then on the company who are providing the service, I’m taking from this that committing crimes is probably not the smartest move just because you’ve got a VPN, but a VPN to cover say your BTC transaction history “Link to your IP address is a smart move.
Which are the best VPN providers?, I was told NORD VPN is good when combined with wasabi wallet and other TOR related products.
I’m not very tech so doing homework really to see how others who are tech minded protect their anonymity or at least take as much of that anonymity back as possible.
Oh just out of curiosity, if everyone leaves a trail how come no one has traced satoshi, or was he just super smart?.

If you’re confident the long term price will go up and you can afford your monthly loan payments go for it, I don’t think it’s foolish because people buy new cars and lose shit loads as soon as they take it out the showroom and you don’t hear everyone saying their stupid “but they are as long term it always depreciates”.
Make sure your loan allows you to pay back the full amount without complications, when your BTC has appreciated to a degree that lets you pay back the loan cash some out and pay your loan off.

Trump is right to influence the Fed to lower interest rates because Europe and the European Central Bank are the ones who want a currency war, which I believe is just starting.
Hopefully Brexit for the Uk will punish the European Central Bank also, yeah the pound will suffer, but that’s a good thing also as maybe house prices in the UK will drop and for sure the none believers or people who ridicule those that hold BTC may look very stupid very soon.

You are better taking out your initial investment if prices have risen enough for you to do so, that way any BTC you have left is free and owes you nothing.
Personally most people who are believers are willing to keep investing because they understand the fundamentals better and see the future for BTC as very bright.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:19:19
The problem with the United States is they claim to be the land of the free but in reality people are not free, because the dollar is the defacto reserve currency any threats to that currency is always dealt with via forcible means either through direct war or legislation.
These shits in government have been writing laws to protect themselves their friends and their general interests since the year dot, and they can easily add more laws to that book.
I’m not sure either way If crypto can be outlawed, but I am looking and thinking how much these laws they are enforcing are making crypto less of a peer to peer protocol as it was originally envisaged and more something that they “especially” the Americans want to own as much as they possibly can through said legislation.
And ironically this goes to show people who live in the US how some foreign countries see the US as a pure evil, not just dictating the lives of its own citizens but dictating the lives of others far away.
I hope they fail personally on all fronts.
You would think gangs like MS13 would be a bigger talking point throughout congress than a new form of payment, that’s the irony of the US.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:11:02
Ummm very interesting what you’ve said, and yes it is fraud but is not the Blockchains weakness IMO, it’s clearly down to zero confirmation setting because no one wants to wait 10 mins for confirmations.
Barely an argument supporting BTC as being as fraudulent as visas clearly bad contactless cards.
I’ve done some digging and it appears the company who run the ATM were targeted for this very reason that they set a zero confirmation for transactions, the irony is unlike visa all they had to do was wait and send the client a PIN number when they had received numerous confirmations, even if that meant the client returning later with their PIN number and collecting their cash.
The latter is clearly a fault by the company who run the machines not the Blockchains design or proof of work surely, also i find it funny calling it a fraud as the machine has a camera in it recording the people who have stolen the money, I mean chances are they’ll be caught and the company will either get their money back or the perpetrators will serve a long prison sentence, more of a theft.
I still wouldn’t agree the same can be said for visa, as the hacker will probably not be caught in the circumstances given in the article, meaning the fraud would cost the visa company and that cost is passed on to the public, so I personally can not see how BTC isn’t by far superior overall.
The other attacks are clearly feasible but it gives no data as to how often if at all they are or have been used, basically it’s showing possibility on lesser Blockchains with less hash power.
Do you have data to show when these double spends have occurred on Bitcoin Blockchain out of interest and how much money was involved, as anyone can say this or that happened without offering solid proof?.
I’ve looked and I cannot find anything proving double spends on the Bitcoin Blockchain they all seem theoretical, plus I’ve not heard anyone on reddit saying they’ve been a victim, nor a merchant, I’m interested to see your proof?.
Third party scams yes and exchanges dodgy deals and malicious buyers on exchanges I grant you BTC is riddled with these, or a rouge employee and zero confirmations, but where is the proof of these double spends other than these.
If your answer is there are none then this network must be more secure than anything in current and previous existence.
So I think you are the one who is misleading people by using the tabloid links you’ve given, which are clearly the ATM companies fault.
Show proof of transaction with say 15 confirmations that are or have been double spends?.
Here is a link for you about credit card fraud, I don’t think there is a comparison in the security of plastic cards over BTC.
How much was the ATM fraud again £113’000.

Ok thanks I get the first part of my question, I did know the private key was stored on the secure chip on the ledger device, but I just didn’t understand that it was completely safe as you’ve explained it is “thank you”.
As for the next part, so if I use a ledger and send from say coinbase, either to coinbase wallet or from a coinbase wallet those transactions are stored on the ledger servers?.
But if my Ledger is linked and used with wasabi wallet those transactions are now not stored on Ledgers servers?, meaning I get back some privacy?, or am I confused.
@_date: 2019-07-29 06:33:27
My experience from UK is all banks eventually flag your buys if you use credit or debit cards, by flagging I mean they will all of a sudden cancel or stop purchases through say coinbase or other centralised exchanges, your card will be blocked and they will site anti fraud detection is the reason they’ve blocked your card.
It can be persistent, so what I do is I cancel or report my card lost and I get them to deliver another with different numbers, when you add the new card as payment often  you can purchase again with no problems as the new card doesn’t have the crypto link, but eventually they’ll block it again.
Just repeat the process and carry on buying, not saying this will work for everyone or everywhere but it’s worth a try.
Only other alternatives are use Bisq.

Sorry but the MySpace scenario is poor at least and not worth my time.
As for value.
Bitcoin can be traded 24/7/365
Bitcoin is a decentralised protocol, “privacy”.
Bitcoin is an open source software.
Bitcoin is peer to peer value distribution.
Bitcoin has a second layer payment system.
Bitcoin has speculation platforms.
Bitcoin is a geo political hedge.
Bitcoin is gold 2.
Bitcoin is property and a virtual good.
Bitcoin is hard wired math, which is un corruptible.
 
The above are just examples of why BTC has value, maybe try sending a few million overseas and see if you then think BTC has no value apart from speculation, I really cannot think or see that you’ve ever interacted with it or at scale.
Please understand transferring wealth without a middle man, it’s a hard task that has value.

@_date: 2019-07-22 19:39:58
I think you need to look at the world with open eyes, you talk of pyramid schemes which are all around us all, in one form or another, all a pyramid scheme means is that someone else buys in and supports the market.
An ideal example is the property market as this relies on buyers entering the market, if new buyers enter prices rise or are supported, and over time investments of this nature pay because land becomes less available, even if prices collapse they only collapse by a proportion and overtime they always rebound because land becomes more scarce over time.
They are simple supply and demand rules, Demand of supply, cut in supply, or equilibrium.
With BTC having a limited supply it also will come under the same price effect.
You have also mentioned all the way through this post that people wouldn’t buy BTC if it wasn’t worth much, yet they already did back in the early days, those people saw value then because they understood that transferring value without a middle man had huge value going forward, so yes I believe everyone who owns BTC would jump at the chance again to buy low.
Also when you say BTC can just be replicated, it already has been yet it’s the network that gives the security and hence the value, and as we’ve seen over the last 10 years that network just gets stronger.
Plus you should read about metcalfe law and then you should see ��, that for Bitcoins value to climb higher over time more users and acceptance are needed, just like Facebook once  only had a few million users it blossomed into a 2.4 billion user base giving FB huge value.
Bitcoin is in no rush to achieve the same “but the same it will achieve IMO”, and Bitcoin doesn’t care whether a no coiner or a none believer doesn’t support it as it marches forward regardless, this is power.
Do you not see how many financiers and very smart people have put a lot of effort into adapting financial tools and software to make all of the above happen, those people are not fools, I would rather follow the lead of those people than the lead of anyone else, because my friend they are the money makers that make this world go round.

Thanks that was a very level headed response to my question, I will mull over your answer for a while so it sinks in.
Seems strange that they allow tether at all, but I get the idea I suppose if you trade I presume moving your bitcoin profits into tether and avoiding any BTC crashes protects those profits and then lets you buy more BTC when the price dips, I know this is not a precise science but I image this is what people do.
Correct me if I’m wrong.

And as for nice beaches I’m sure there are, I was commenting more about the knife crime “stabbing” and general unruly behaviour that the UK politicians seem oblivious too.
Also a chimp “MARK CARNEY”, who in charge of the Bank of England getting paid £500’000 per year plus benefits just because he can lower interest rates and knows little more about how to sort out Britain’s debt time bomb.

I don’t understand why tether has an effect on Bitcoin as I though Bitcoin was stand alone with its own network “the network being most of the value via security”, so why does BTC bother what tether does, as BTC doesn’t bother what other crypto coins do.

Yeah the £20 note is the most forged, but the £50 note being the largest denomination has for years been used for years by criminals for money laundering, in fact it is rarely used by the public it is meant to serve.
Reading into the BOE policy on bank notes, the £50 was debated to be scraped for the above reason.
My personal experience is they aren’t accepted as much as other notes and I find it highly ironic that the BOE or any other bank thinks they won’t be forged, they will.

I’m far from an expert in this field but I get what you are trying to do, as previous people have said timing cashing out at the top is more luck than judgement as the price may drop as quick as it went up.
Just don’t get greedy and don’t worry if the price rises after you’ve sold as long as you are happy with the gain.
Maybe if you convert to gold would be better, I know crypto to gold in the UK has no tax implications “or should i say I think”, then maybe over the counter trading desks may be able to sell the BTC for you, you’d have to enquire.
Or you could buy property or other goods with it and sell them on later.

You Misunderstand open source protocols especially Bitcoins “you are repeating the same thing ”on Reddit about BTC has no value because there are many other crypto’s and as everyone has agreed there are  many.
There is a cunning reason satoshi made BTC open source and that was because anyone can look at the source code and see it has no back doors or untoward things included in it, but the real reason is so that anyone can use it and create a crypto token, and people have and if the algorithm runs the same as Bitcoins any improvements to those tokens software can be also easily implemented into the bitcoin protocol.
In layman’s terms BTC doesn’t just have its own Devs working on improvements it logically has all of those other Devs working on improvement too.
Could you show me for example any other token with the network security BTC has in hash rate?, as security is the major player in a Blockchains future.
You seem like you preach future events without proof of what you preach, like Facebook being worthless in the future based on your myspace example, when Facebook will adapt to market changes.
If you are seriously comparing Bitcoin with beanie babies and tulip mania I’d probably say you’ve only just heard about BTC and clearly you’re just repeating what a few fools in the past have said, as the network effect has proven they were all mis guided and clearly wrong because basically they didn’t understand the subject they were talking about.
But I can offer you some advice, people on Reddit have heard these troll arguments a ridiculous amount of time in the past, most on here like me will just say if you don’t like it why participate as you’ll not convince us what we already know to be true so why waste your time, don’t buy crypto stay out of the space you’ll be a happier person.
Ps I kinda think you’re confused also about pyramid structures in society as a whole, deeming them as unworkable��, when I think you say pyramid you are really thinking unlawful ponzi.
There is a big difference.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:07:20
 No that’s not what it works like at all, Blockchains are nothing more than glorified Excel spreadsheets, in fact they are slow, trying to detach the reward token from the blockchain means you have no security through miner reward.
The rearward is the key to a successful decentralised network.
And as I’ve already shown you there is nothing stopping anyone creating their own token, but good luck convincing the miners globally that they should transfer all their hash power over to the other untested tokens network ������.
And remember my point that any improvement to BTC can be incorporated into BTCs software if that token was built off Bitcoins white paper.
The reality is there is little point in wasting time going in this direction, BTCs market dominance is stripping away shit coin needs, we have data on this that Bitcoins market dominance is now 70% and growing, my view is 95% of other crypto coins will have their wealth transferred into BTC at some point.
Litecoin in fact is the prime example of the blockchain and token you speak about and there are others, you’re confused by this “WHATS STOPPING SOMEONE TALK”, I’m telling you it’s been done, yet BTC is market dominant not only in hash rate, but in price, and also in creation.
Must try harder.

Hi there is a great post on wasabi wallet on reddit today I have looked at as well as the information you have kindly shown me.
Finally I am starting to understand coinjoin “I think haha”, the so called anonymity set is how many people you join the coins with and over 50 gives your coins their privacy, meaning any authority or software tracking transaction now cannot 100% say these BTC belong to that person so these coins are now private?.
Guy also ran a nord VPN as extra security, sounds very meticulous.
But it would take a while I suppose to privatise a Bitcoin because I understand you should only coinjoin small amounts.

I wouldn’t disagree with what you’ve said, and personally I agree and I’m pro BTC “but” although BTC is very difficult to outlaw I’m not so convinced they couldn’t do it.
Firstly any country that wants to come of the dollar will automatically feel the full force of the US military, basically they’ll do anything possible to hold onto that power.
As much as I’d love to see hyperinflation grip the USA, I can’t envisage it happening basically because if the US prints money they pay no interest on what they print, in other words they can’t print and print forever, only if they voluntarily declared themselves bankrupt would they become bankrupt “unlike countries who’s currency is not pegged to the US dollar, generally those countries are the ones who’s monetary systems fail.
Now 90% of the public fear authority and the power of the law, even though you would not stop using BTC because it’s your fundamental right and you enjoy the freedom it gives “I do also ����”, but what if a law was passed to imprison individuals that did interact with crypto?.
My opinion on that law would be the masses wouldn’t entertain it or it’s market, it would become a dark market tool.
I’m not saying this or that will happen but I feel they are starting to wield their powers, ironically we are now since the news of FB bringing out Libra “for the record I can’t stand Zuckerberg as I think he’s a tech thief and an idea thief” that news is now effecting BTC price when BTC is a real crypto currency unlike Libra so why are we even mentioning them in the same breath.
And if BTC is devoid of fear of what US authority can do why is the price tanking on the news that’s been thrown around today.
Views please.

The article isn’t about sterling, it’s about a method of paying with various fiat currencies through visa.
It is also fraud to increase the money supply through Quantitative easing, “FRAUD” except its sold to the masses of being a way of spurring growth because central banks and governments have fucked up.

I can only say that you’ve explained that impeccably, took me a while to reply because that is very complex for a none trader to take on board, and I will have to read this through myself more times before I really get it.
I did read a story about some guy shorting BTC that made a fortune, I believe it was in the region of $75 million dollars.
It  looks not so difficult at first glance, as if I did it I would go long on say the BTC halvening, surely the price would be higher.

Go back and read, NO ONE SAYS IT CANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Go and create your own “BUNNYANDTHORNTON” crypto coin, GO AHEAD if you have the tech know how, because you’ll also have your own BLOCKCHAIN that your apply named coin will run on.
But what you won’t have is network security in fact if you tell me about your coin I’ll hack it and double spend because I have more hash power than you.
Everyone on this post has been telling you this is value for many reasons yet your laborious denial carries on.
Why don’t you learn about network security if you did you’d realise that BTCs mining network is under bombardment 24/7 by bad players yet it’s security is so strong now it is impervious to attack, and even if you were to try and attack it the miners would know and counter act that 51% attack.
Frankly speaking it’s a beast with no fraudulent transactions.
Can you name any other network without fraud in traditional markets ��?, please educate yourself.
Here is some reading for you NETWORK SECURITY, remember I told you how you can send large amounts of money with a cheap fee fast with absolute security across borders from one wallet to another.
Try doing it with BUNNYANDTHORNTON coin hahahahahahahaha!
I am starting to laugh at you and not with you.
And if or when you reply try adding source material, rather than just saying what you think as you’ll find you put over a more intellectual argument my friend.
I dare not ask but if you consider the above would you now see more value in BTC than just what you previously perceived, as you only saw the trader speculation?.
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:42:31

Can you post some examples of double spends.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:27:46
What that means in simpleton terms is BTCs network and transactions are all verified so no fraud can occur when a transaction is made.
Visa and all fiat currencies are full of fraud, it’s not comparing because there is no comparison as I said BTC is superior in every way.
You’re  the one saying stupid things like sterling has no fraud ��, what do you think counterfeiting is?
What do you think pumping the money supply is?
Fraud that’s what it is because the general public lose in one way or another.
I’m kinda not getting the not the same argument no one said they were the same, what was said was BTC doesn’t have fraud.

I may read about tether, it’s not something I’ve looked at ����.
I can remember the economist “DR DOOM” often using the printing of tether as an excuse for Bitcoins price rises, clearly BTC has many sound reasons for price rises other than tether, but as I say I will look a bit deeper when I have time.

I’m ��, I see ��, just out of interest how do you see Bitcoin do you see most of its current value as speculation like some economists do, or do you see fundamental value at present?.

It’s all irrelevant as as long as it’s not a Ponzi scheme it’s fine, pyramid structure is prevalent in many walks of life, as most value relies on others buying in or supporting the market.
Because the word pyramid is used it does not mean there isn’t real value.

If you choose to send large amounts of value over a blockchain with less security that’s your choice, personally I wouldn’t as I trust Bitcoin for those purposes.
Please give me a reason why the dollars good besides being forced upon people ��‍♂️, your going round in a never ending circle trying to convince yourself that you are right, when the market dictates you’re wrong.
Nothing will succeed unless it popular I did show you metcalfes law and it’s effects on a company or asset, in this case Bitcoin.
I’ve just sent you numerous reasons how BTC has value apart from speculation with many more coming in the future.
You’re very entertaining at least, let me tell you how BTC works, you see if you have no knowledge of computer science understanding BTCs white paper is IMO is very, if not impossible to understand.
Secondly unless you also have a reasonable understanding of phycology and human nature yet again you’ll not understand.
And lastly and IMO the hardest of all, if you have little understanding of money and finance then BTCs value with be hard again to get to grasps with.
But if you approach the subject with an open mind you at least have a chance and I have met many with your blinkered view in the past “no offence”, but if you open your mind you may one day have an “EPIPHANY” on this subject and I assure you when you do it’s a once in a lifetime feeling, and as I say I know people who were like you and one day they said “WOW” I really do get it now.

I’ve just told you, the USA can’t go Bankrupt, it is and always will be business as usual, seriously man it’s a strong system that they can manipulate at will, just like whales manipulate BTC.
People don’t really understand what kind of power they wield, it’s the ultimate power, they don’t care about decentralised systems because if they chose they could buy all the BTC because all holders have a sale price they’d let their holding go for, in fact they can create the money out of thin air, either way they always win and that’s good.
People on here laugh, but their laughter masks the real thoughts in their minds that “you know what he’s right”.
Or the smart people think the same.
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:37:32
That’s because these people are brainwashed, most people on here don’t even understand BTC, and they certainly don’t understand economics, the classic signs are.
1) the USA will default, and no it won’t because it can only default through choice, it’s a bit like BTC miners double spending by owning more than 51% of the hash rate, why would they “suicide”.
2) we are all poorer now than we ever have been because central banks can’t handle monetary policy, yet the truth is we are all better off.
I could go on to show further how pathetic Reddit clientele is as regards lies and blasphemy towards a system that has pulled them all out the gutter and given them life.
3) And the biggest ass wipe joke in crypto is these inbreds don’t realise that it’s the institutions they slate, like the banks and the money makers who are the key to crypto price rises, the irony is so laughable “satoshi dream will be owned eventually by the exact people it was designed to exclude ����‍♂️��.
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:11:12
One sale!, why would someone spend it when it’s going to be worth more in the future, spending fiat is logical because it’s worth less than bitcoin, so spending the least valuable is the wise choice.

Ummmmm there is one blaring problem and that’s it’s fixed supply won’t work once the last coins are mined as there won’t be enough in fees to keep its network secure, also because it was designed badly from day one it’s only survived with second layer add ons, and those layers will go further in the future “third, fourth, fifth ect, this will take fees away from the main network leaving it vulnerable to attack.
This isn’t made up, some of the leading minds in BTC have debated this capped inflation system and found its got serious weakness going forward, and the only way you’ll cure this problem is by increasing the supply.
People only believe what suits, often ignoring the facts.

The United States can create as many dollar bills as they choose, because the world works on a fiat currency system, the dollars the US creates come at no added cost to the US, what that means is they can indefinitely create dollars at “, “NO COST”, really buddy “NO COST”.
In simpleton terms that means that any debts the US government have can be payed at NO COST to the US government, it’s a really cleaver trick.
This is the reason that interest rates on US dollar dept have gone down and “NOT UP” even though the dept has ballooned, are you seeing the clearer truth yet ����‍♂️, this is also why the UK has very low rated on its debt despite having high debt to GDP, then there is japan who has an astounding dept to GDP yet also has ridiculously low rates.
Let’s take Argentina “it had to default on its debt because it had pegged its self to the dollar, it therefore wasn’t sovereign with regard to its currency since it had to maintain its currency peg ������‍♂️.
Greece the same thing it hadn’t used it’s own currency for 10 years, of course it was heading to bankruptcy.

Oh could you show me how China will take away the US dollar are the world reserve currency without committing financial suicide, I’d suggest you’re talking out your ass and have no understanding how things work, so I’ll show you.
Since 2015 62% of countries anchor their currency to the dollar and about the same percentage of developing countries borrow in this currency.
On the other hand barely 30% of countries use the euro as a anchor for their exchange rates, and only 13% of external debt for developing countries is euro-denominated. The pound and the yen barely show up in the data. 
And the dollar is unrivalled as a reserve currency held by central banks.
Pretty much your comments alone “HEY GUYS”
Shows you’re clearly another financially uneducated retard, YEAH PIGS COULD FLY if they had wings, just like the yuan could become the worlds reserve currency but as I’ve shown you it won’t, and only a fool would believe such crap.

And printing money makes little difference as long as you keep a cap on inflation, which the US has done very well, also what’s created can also be cancelled out it’s a two way street, you’re looking at it as a one way street, far less doom when you see the real truth.

I realise now how many extremely smart people work on bitcoin related products and I’m sure satoshi would be proud of where his or her idea has got to.

I’m personally not convinced outlawing works as drugs is a prime example and other things throughout the centuries, I believe if BTC was outlawed it would be driven underground as you’ve said and would be worth a lot more basically because of risk to reward “I mean if you’re looking at a 10 year prison sentence then the price must reflect this risk”.
And yes as you’ve pointed out they have already tried outlawing BTC in some regions yet here it still is.
I would like a day when all coins are coinjoined  so no authority figures know where transactions go or from who to who, but then I believe in complete freedom as what we have now is tyranny just on a slightly lower scale than communist countries.

So the likes of Hal Finney and other cryptographers are just excellent at maths or higher maths if you like?.
Yes he’s probably amazed how far it’s come and how widely discussed it has become, how do you see its value say over the next couple of years going?, I know it’s speculative but do you think as I do that BTC is very undervalued because of how ground breaking it is.
How come no one had ever solved the double spend before? I mean is it or was it a gigantic problem?, for me if this problem had of been solved a long time ago maybe we would have been moving over to digital currencies long ago, what’s your view.
But getting back to Nakamoto you clearly believe he was a cryptographer first and foremost and probably earns his living in that field?, and the computer coding was something he could do but not his day job?.

I see that’s very interesting and I get the larger transactions being done on chain for security of course.
I don’t really under second layer that well but I do understand it’s for smaller everyday purchases.
I do have one question though relating to satoshi original Bitcoin idea, please quote me if I’m wrong but there is something I’ve never understood.
Originally when Bitcoin came  out I believe satoshi had an email discussion with someone about scaling and I was led to believe that satoshi originally said it could scale to visa type transactions, simply through the use of SVP wallets, “not sure if I’ve got the SVP bit right hope you know what I mean”.
So there is no doubt this person or persons “satoshi Nakamoto” is clearly very smart and understands computer science and coding ect, so if he did say that about it could scale in this way “was he wrong and if so I cannot understand why he would get something which seems so blazingly obvious wrong after designing something so smart?.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

I will reply to your question as you seem quite misinformed, I first knew about BTC and owned BTC in mid 2012, don’t argue with me on this point when I say literally “no one” had a clue what it was.
So let’s now fast forwards as you’ve seen BTC has recently been debated in Congress and by the International Monetary Fund, it’s spread and is spreading like a virus slowly but surely.
Like satoshi once said if you can’t see it or don’t get it, I wouldn’t waste my time trying to convince you, but believe me over the last 6.5 years it has gained enough traction, for one it can’t be stopped, 2 people who you least think own it do own it do, and finally 3 most proponents of the Bitcoin is useless brigade shout so because they couldn’t see value and still don’t, these are the losers you decide which you are.

Wouldn’t you say realistically those technical issues are really limiting for BTC as I would.
I would say the industry as a whole is to manipulated and I would say this limits BTCs adoption because people aren’t happy with huge price swings.
Legal hurdles are basic to explain “BTC companies that can help adoption either do comply to whatever rules are put onto them or they’ll not be allowed to operate long term”.
And yes those countries who have limited its use and spread clearly aren’t going to let BTC disrupt the financial systems of their countries, it’s not going to change.

But in the mean time I did some research for blocked connections and that’s what lead me to the TOR download browser route, anyway as you’ve pointed out yes it is more of a security and privacy question “as for using TOR on IOS rather than regular search engines.

Yes I know it has the highest hash rate I’m not arguing that, I’ve said that hash rate and the security that it brings can collapse under the right circumstances I did give you some scenarios.
Simply put miners don’t mine transaction for fun they do it for profit, when there is no profit they shut down the hardware “logically if it doesn’t cover the electric costs there is no point”.
Liquidity there is very little in BTC “why do you think the price is so volatile?”, or are you confusing liquidity with market cap because If you are market caps on crypto coins can drop like stones.
Proof of stake coin is just a verified transaction on a blockchain it’s not unique nor is the idea of consensus.
Like I said bad news doesn’t do BTC any favours it’s price buckles often, thinking hash rate will always be strong and prices high could be a mistake as anything can happen.

No matter where you buy it from sooner or later you’ll want to cash out “right”, when your BTC has gone up in value you’ll sell and the fiat you crave will be deposited into “your Bank account”.
The account has your name and your location and your address details linked to it, so there is no privacy when you head for the exit so to speak “you can be traced and they can trace the first transaction right through to the day you cash out”.

People on reddit don’t like hyper critical people and most don’t like anything that seems against BTC, I’m a little controversial in the respect I like BTC but I can’t do with the lies people tell.
The biggest issue I have is why people don’t get supply and demand, I know OTC trades don’t effect price as that’s the whole idea of OTC, but I’m meant to believe that all mined coins are being sold OTC that’s why the price isn’t moving up ��”I don’t think so”, so logically the price says BTC isn’t being bought in high enough volumes either by retail or other to move the price.

I don’t understand why you laugh, clearly you’ve not worked this one out either.
You see Bitcoin only works as badly as it does because governments allow exchanges to operate, clearly the market needs these exchanges so new adopters can enter the market.
As I said before the government allow them to operate under their terms, and they suck those terms up whether they like them or not because they profit from operating.
Decentralised exchanges like Bisq just can’t cut it like a mammoths  like coinbase.
So if you’re stupid enough to believe that regulators aren’t in control go and look how many exchanges and start ups are having more and more regulation steamed upon them.
Now consider if they stopped them operating “where prey tell would all these mythical adopters buy their BTC” ����‍♂️, on street corners ��.
And this is what’s called centralisation “do as we say when we say it or we will shut you down”.

Liquidity eventually makes highly volatile less volatile when you’ve been into BTC for a while you get used to large shifts in price and ignore them literally.
Traders are attracted because high risk high reward or high loss of course.
For me network security is one of BTCs best strength.
And personally I’m not one who cares who owns BTC because when you finally get the whole BTC thing you’ll not look back and even if it failed in some way going forward which I don’t think it will I would still think it was an opportunity missed.
Good luck with your bit of the market.

Possible but not probable, but then DONALD TRUMP is a wild card and you never know.
If you cannot use Bitcoin and you have no means other than Peer to Peer with cash to buy it and sell it, it becomes worthless fast.

As I said no one really cares about OTC trades as they don’t do anything for the price, granted they strip away supply and in the long term will have an effect on price, the whole reason to keep trades OTC is so it doesn’t show up in exchanges volumes, but I personally don’t think it forces prices higher.
As for whales of course they can influence the market as 80% of Bitcoins are owned by only a few wallets, why do you think the SEC ���� look at BTC the way they do.

And yeah they’ll lose financially, but don’t think for one minute the rich won’t as they have far more to lose and they’re always the first people who look for the nearest rope or high building.
Poorer people are more resilient.
Anyway it’s time this system collapsed and a new world order is brought out of any remaining ashes.
Fuck banks, fuck politicians and fuck the rich.

Doesn’t LN have problems in the respect it’s a compromise on some issues and those compromises make it more centralised.
Just recently a major flaw was pointed out, of course I know issues need to be solved.
How does LN work without power, Meshnets seem not to have this weak link, I’m not saying they’re better i am saying they seem better in some respects.
Adoption isn’t about LN or Meshnets it’s about people’s interest in using crypto above what’s on offer now.
The latter is true because you have to buy BTC to take part in LN transaction, LN could be the best thing since sliced bread but if people don’t buy BTC that don’t matter.
You have to get adoption first and this is what people miss.

Why would you use that though over fiat, any gain in the price of a bitcoin how ever small from when you buy the Bitcoin to when you use it at point of payment for your goods triggers a capital gains tax fee.
Why wouldn’t you just pay with fiat like the guys pointing out.

Only things I know about Lloyd’s is coinbase related stuff, if you buy buy debit card they’ll periodically stop payments to coinbase “reasons fraud”, if you cancel the card and get a new one you’re back in business.
Don’t have any other crypto related payments go into your accounts, without the sender is masking their true identity.
The above I assure you won’t be flagged and your account won’t be closed, and smart crypto companies you deal with if either you buy or sell should let the payment into your account look like any other random payment “not look at this  transaction it’s from CRYTO LAND”, which clearly will get flagged eventually IMO.
Companies and individuals need to get smart where these fuckers are concerned.

Simply put decentralisation doesn’t work.
TOR is decentralised not that many out the 8 billion use it apart from countries that have restriction, sure crypto may work for them long term it won’t be Bitcoin i assure you.
Go out ask a thousand people you’ll be lucky if you get 10 say they value decentralisation.
I would rather agree with most early adopters who have cashed out and moved on and most have because it’s a failed project it’s become and will become more and more centralised “kinda defeats the object of what you and most others say and think”.
You can also do it in 10 years or at least a solid structure look at this.

@_date: 2019-10-13 10:05:21
So no one who makes the code for LN can influence outcomes if they chose?.
And how under AML and KYC will LN transaction satisfy regulators, am I led to believe that anyone can make a transaction without any records being kept if so how long before regulators insist on records?.
So on that point that’s no better than shadow banking wasn’t Bitcoin created to do away with those practices.
Also how can exchanges and wallet providers operate the LN system legally if they’re not or there is no way of recording transactions or they can chose which they record ��?.
Basically if I work for you and you pay me in Bitcoin say LNs limited in BTC there is no record you sent it or I received it “is that correct?”, I understand invoices can be produced but never the less is my analogy correct.
If the above is correct surely that’s a money laundering tool, how will it be allowed to operate as it’s not decentralised so can clearly be shut down?.
It’s also not correct that it’s not custodial in fact on chain transactions are all logged this is why Bitcoin has appeal over traditional banking system “open ledger logs” you are saying LN doesn’t record logs in these bilateral private channels so what that means is those transactions can be tampered with which is my point so it doesn’t solve a problem it creates another “criminal activity”.
You can argue to regulators if needs be  that BTC blockchain is opaque and transactions can be traced which IMO is more off putting to criminals which is it’s best point” LN sacrifices this unique feature.

You don’t get taxed on normal fiat currency but you do on transactions implemented with bitcoins, if there is a gain it is taxable.
They’re called capital gains taxable events, that’s why most people don’t have interest in it as a payment rail, why pay added tax when you can use fiat which isn’t subject to capital gains taxes.
Try harder.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:36:14
Capital controls Not in the west they don’t and they aren’t likely to either, BTC may be ok in those economies that are scraping the floor in South America.
As for BTC it has had double spends in its early history and on chain double spends recently in canada, albeit most hacks are from wallets but hacks all the same = lost money that’s not insured.
Also there have been major software flaws picked up in the BTC code, luckily they have been found by BTC friendly devs “if someone malicious had found the flaw” and used it to print BTC WELL!
BTC loses it censorship resistance with second layers like LN, Plus most exchanges are monitored and censored, I wouldn’t say BTC is so censorship resistant.
Transferring value without permission ummmm, I don’t have to ask my bank if I want to transfer money “I just log on and do it” no one I know has ever had to physically ask permission.

I couldn’t agree more with the Middle age theory and maybe because it’s cryptography I’m presuming it is more of a males interest rather than a women’s “especially back then”.
And yes sure think you are on the right track with the having an interest in money and how it works “GOLD STANDARD ECT”, just doesn’t add up for someone to think about BTC over a short space of time and have the intelligence to create it quickly either.
Can cryptography be self taught like coding can?, or is it too difficult a subject without having “teacher guidance”, and is cryptography like most other skills you’ll have your famous people who are exceptional and “Known” and  your more run of the mill everyday kinda cryptographers “Less known”?.
The reason I ask is it’s sure hard to hide in a small forest so to speak but easy to hide in a big one.
I think BTC no doubt is GOLD 2 a digital version, so he’s partly for-filled his goal.
And I absolutely agree on your thoughts and logic about the idea and how the idea has come from the internet.
I know many people who have dismissed BTC and still do for the simple reasons you’ve stated, HOAX. DISTRUST because it’s decentralised ect.

You keep saying BTC is a store of value because the price is artificially up, what would you say if it was $1000 dollars and you invested higher, I don’t get the SOV logic.
You say subjective about it spreading and I say let’s look at supply and demand.
If I live in a cold dry country and i sell umbrellas at £10 each I may sell a few “not many”, so my price would stay the same may even drop.
If global warming in years to come meant now it rains most days I would sell loads of umbrellas “in fact I’m increasing my prices”, as long as the demand stays constant I make more and more money.
So saying to me demand is high without price increases to match that demand doesn’t work, it shows me there’s less demand than supply and also none of the demand is constant.
Back to store of value if I put £1000 into my paypal account it’s still £1000 a year later, if I buy £1000 of bitcoin and I go back a year later there is no guarantee it’s still worth a thousand.
I know people who bought in late who are still waiting for price rises so their in profit again.

My opinion is no I cannot see it, simply put if all these stories or scenarios were true whether it be  people buying in or government or institutions “the latter has had some support”, but generally if this was all true supply would probably already be broken via demand and you’d know this because prices would be way higher due to the supply shock.
You simply cannot strip supply on such a limited asset and it not show in a massive price increase.

The halvening will be a massive anti climax simply because cutting supply with low demand won’t increase price.
People are getting this completely wrong in the respect that “demand” comes first and foremost and there simply isn’t the demand on a large enough scale to move the BTC price “that’s why it up and down”.
Average joe is only interested in Bitcoin when the price rises so logically you need those three factors.
1) increases in price without slip back
2) more interest from average joe
3) and a supply cut “halvening”.
If you don’t have these factors your halvening event may take years and years before it pays dividends for investors.
Look at the BTC price if it’s not going up people are not buying “PERIOD”.

I didn’t say it hasn’t got a use for early investors and maybe a few other implementations.
But no if you think that the BTC price is based on adoption you’re seriously wrong, sure there are more people now own bitcoin but it’s market is tiny “flea on a dogs back small”, it’s price is made up by a mix or retail investors thinking they’ll get rich quick and speculators who mainly manipulate the market.
One of the biggest links to BTC price rises is tether printing, all the above are barely solid investment opportunities because the price can tank in minutes.
This is why institutional investors shun BTC why would I invest a million today if a whale can tank the price tomorrow, believe me the mining pools may be decentralised but the BTC whale wallets certainly are not ��.
Bitcoin isn’t by definition a store of value as a store of value has to have stability, yeah it’s a store of value for me because any new retail investors make me richer.
But ultimately you can clearly see the market and it’s expansion is minuscule as if it was spreading the price would be rising “it’s not in fact there have been more sell offs than buy ins”.

You’re entitled to your opinion, the flaw in that argument is BTCs network effect is only based on profit so if that profit isn’t there anymore there is less or in a worse case scenario no network security anymore.
People are fickle so are miners, once another opportunity comes along and if BTC faltered for any reason it could be all over.
Look at history many things have failed that everyone said they couldn’t or wouldn’t, BTC becomes more centralised daily and centralisation is what killed the first E money protocols.

Best preforming asset in history because of tether printing and manipulation “YEAH”.
And actually it’s not there were certain stocks that out preformed BTC even at the height of the BULL RUN in 2018.
No ones saying paper money will survive for ever, just it’s better today “period”.
Plastic cards are better also and easier.
Central banks can create their own currency that won’t come up against all the regulation, Bitcoin only operates if people buy in if they buy in to something else then bitcoins dead.

You could in theory just use it as a store of value sure and with enough participants it would work.
But the problem is it’s to complicated and you’ll never convince the lazy masses to store their hard earned money in something with potential security issues “tech savvy people no problem”.
No one knows if a bug exists in BTCs software that could be a major vulnerability “they’ have luckily found others and it was friendly devs that found them”, others may exist that can be exploited and next time it may hackers that find one”.
My point is there are vectors that could end or severely damage BTCs record “it’s not a given just because the network has survived for over 10 years.
So I wouldn’t personally choose BTC because maybe I could wake up and BTC is no more.
My choice would be art work, gold, property “which most choose”, or multiple bank accounts with insurance up to and above the level of the money I decide to deposit.
So yeah without being used it’s use case is far worse as people are not cueing for it as a store of value, people just believe they are.

Where is it you’re living saying you don’t have control over your money?
Hash rate means nothing apart from more mining or better hardware is operational, hash rates have dropped recently and if price lowers more they will again.
Subscribers on reddit what a steady million of that wow world changing.
Wallet creation means nothing as people have multiple wallets it’s not a true figure, a whale or an exchange can split fortunes down into smaller amounts meaning more wallets “just looks like more people participating”.

Failures I think is the main issue, Bitcoins systems can fail because they’re online and online is the weak link in the chain, so LN is online.
Meshnets aren’t online so for this reason there is no point of failure, only I don’t understand if they can scale or they cannot scale.
They just seem to me like a logical evolution in the security and censorship resistance stakes.

You’re not that smart even though you are preaching like Andreas antonopolous which you’re clearly not.
Firstly you like everyone else in this community is taking decentralisation for granted “no one in power cares most of the public don’t care” Bitcoin is nothing without exchanges, on and of ramps and wallet providers and the merchants it craves for its growth all of which are ban able no one would give a shit about bitcoin then because it’s value would drop.
What was it you said last time you checked laws stop at boarders ��, that’s what Facebook though until this ruling.
Facebook accuses European Union of policing free speech after court ruling 
So if you think for one minute the authorities around the world couldn’t strangle bitcoins life blood you’re an idiot.
Oh and do you know how you enforce laws you pass? You fine them again and again and again it’s very effective because eventually if they don’t comply they become insolvent.
That’s not Bitcoin I’m talking about it’s everything related to it that’s not decentralised, you kill it that way.

I’d still say all gateways and crypto no matter which ones end up back at a bank account in the purchasers name.
Believe me if BTC ever went to 50k they’d be dumping it like no tomorrow no matter what they’d like you to think.
Every tax authority globally would be hell bent on tracing individuals, even your bank would flag the deposit and maybe ask questions, banks do report suspicious deposits to the government.

“BUT” we all know it couldn’t scale “failed miserably” has become a whipping boy for every regulator and hasn’t for-filled its early day promise of being a truly private and secure decentralised system.
So taking into account the above Meshnets are The best chance yet of a true saviour for BTC, I think satoshi would agree because everything as yet put forward is lacking in many ways except false BTC proponents welcome them with open arms out of desperation IMO.

Quote me if I’m wrong but isn’t he saying that even if BTC does hit big figure amounts it can and probably will still crash down and then run again to new highs.
Clearly Plan B sees in the historic charts and events that are yet to unfold what most other observers can’t.
One thing I don’t understand from what he’s said is when does BTC become stable as I was led to believe stability comes from liquidity, so if we did get by 2024 a BTC price of 400’000k surely this amount of liquidity would tame volatility?.

Firstly take away on and off ramps “BTC isn’t that great unless you can cash out no matter what you’re told”.
Secondly pass universal laws deeming it illegal  “ I guarantee you this will stop any adoption as 90% of the public have none illegal alternatives and they also don’t want a criminal record or prison time.
Bitcoin is now underground and it would die quickly.
Of course none of the above will ever happen because BTC isn’t a threat to current systems even if it expands it will live along side traditional systems.
But it could be stopped.

Yeah sure look forward to it, but I’ll give you some advise the first sign of a cult mentality is when it’s participants start to preach and they generally preach the same things over and over that’s because they learn those preachings from their leaders or peers reddit is full of these people and preaching the same routine the same words over and over trying to brainwash the newbie members until they also start to preach.
Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying you’re one but there are many and they may be really intelligent people both men and women, but even though you’re intelligent it doesn’t mean you are not susceptible to being brainwashed, in fact if you are you won’t realise it but others will.
I would class bitcoin as no more than a cult following and in most cases it’s members are brainwashed their hostility shows this.
This article is very similar in its brainwashing of the general public.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:21:11
Yes you can do that IMO I don’t think the public are interested in doing that as they are lazy and have easier ways to function in everyday life.
You can hold your own private key sure.
But either way if the USA decided they’d take BTC down to the point it would only ever stay a niche market or dark markets entity, then I’m afraid you’d find it was all over very quickly.
People out there don’t really care about private keys and decentralised networks full nodes and complicated payment methods, that’s why BTC is still a tiny market.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:14:22
BTC was designed with 21 million supply to stop inflation that’s what the halvening is all about, if you cut the block reward it keeps a cap on inflation by limiting the mining reward going forward “this is a why BTC is deflationary or goes up in value over time.
Inflationary is fiat currency as governments set an annual inflation rate of usually 2% what that means is your wages you pay in your bank if you save them all year will be worth less the following year.
But steady inflation rates are important as they are designed to get you spending as consumers are meant to, if every one holds like in BTC and doesn’t spend eventually the wheels fall off and the economy seizes up.
Now you know why economists don’t like deflationary currency.

So as I said if people are not buying bitcoin up to and after the halvening in quantities larger than the amount miners are being awarded, ultimately price won’t increase.
If the price of bitcoins fall it is because people are selling generally and increasing the amount available on the market, this is the same in any field you may want to look at.
A consolidating price will mean there are as many buyers as sellers which keeps a stable price overall.
Your BTC price can’t even hit 20k like 2018 even though tether printing had a lot of influence then, yet you’re leading me to believe that just because a daily mined BTC reward from 1800 to 900 is going to show large price increases, ummm not without a demand higher than the supply it’s not.
Show me some evidence of what you say and I’ll show you the BTC price today that doesn’t look like high demand.
@_date: 2019-10-13 18:06:50
Trade OFFs you mean like bitcoins trade OFF LN.
You simply learn and build from its mistakes that’s how evolution works.
Yes they do lack the security only because people are still here mining because the price is high enough to make profit, if mining pools thought BTCs price wasn’t as attractive as say new coin with better attributes they can simply move over as long as the algorithm is suitable.
Point being cost and greed is the motivation none of the BS about changing the world.
Many people would argue as to how decentralised BTC is now compared to the early days , facts are some at Blockstream even agree when it comes to crypto we may have to compromise for it to work.
My guess no way they’ll let a decentralised currency prevail “seriously take away government and central bank power”, try it your mining farms will be hit with cruise missiles in an instant.

Yeah I’d agree, but even though BTC was meant as this hedge against recession its model is a failure IMO for that purpose.
You see an economic downturn needs people to spend more “not hoard more” the more you cut spending and the more you hoard the worse your recession becomes.
That’s why central banks free up more money and lower interest rates to spur growth.
You’re clearly clued up I don’t have to explain that to you I know, but Bitcoin does encourage hoarding.
I always ask myself how many people would buy BTC If there wasn’t the promise of large returns my guess would be not many.

Yes I had read an article on stock to flow, it seems like another supply and demand scenario, I really hope it’s true as I see BTC really spreading with higher value and from the extra liquidity we should start to see slightly less volatility, albeit I read that a Bitcoin price of around £380 thousand dollars would be needed to virtually eliminate BTC volatility.
Yes I have seen interviews with Adam Back and I read also about David Chaums attempts at digital money, so yeah it seems like satoshi has used everything possible to manage what he has “respect to him for sure”.
And yeah as for who satoshi is I’m sticking to my belief that he’s just a smart guy with patience and maybe not the best at or in the fields needed but then he’s proved he didn’t need to be as he was the person who pulled it off and opened the flood gates.

You probably don’t have to run in debt but over population and stains on societies demand more and more growth, I wouldn’t argue it’s not a flawed horrendously unfair system of greed and more greed.

Yes I think that’s true that the internet and other technical advances were a challenge for the public and in some cases still are but the problem with those comparisons is, firstly Bitcoin doesn’t open up the world like they do.
Bitcoin isn’t useful without a mobile device
Bitcoin in many ways is reliant on an internet connection, those technologies are not reliant on bitcoin.
It all comes down to whether people need Bitcoin or the internet and mobile phones, the latter they do the former they don’t.
Also it’s not that I don’t give them credit what I know is they’re not going to change their lazy attitude, example more people choose takeaway food than cooking themselves with fresh ingredients because by nature they’re lazy and like things easy “Bitcoin isn’t easy by any imagination and super risky”.
I don’t disagree people are here because they’re betting high risk for high reward I just don’t believe there are that many.
BTC hasn’t been resistant to attack for 10years there were early bugs found that allowed double spends obviously patched now, also it can end in an instant if another came along even the likes of Greg Maxwell voiced this concern above 51% attacks which seem unlikely my point being that history is not something that makes the future a given and it’s dangerous to think that way IMO.
I don’t believe it’s a store of value in the true sense of the word it only is that for early adopters who bought cheap, former buyers who bought for dollars have a huge cushion compared to those in deficit that bought at 15k “try telling them BTC is a SOV they’d laugh at you”, so the real reason BTC can’t be a store of value as yet IMO is it’s too manipulated “period”.
You could lose money on real estate most don’t, I don’t know anyone who’s loses money on fine art, gold has swings also but you’re not likely to see swings like BTC has.
BTC is dumb in the sense no one can speak for it, and the people that try to often manipulate the truth those that don’t get called troll or no coiner which makes BTC weaker because really good ideas are often missed or walked over.
Just my opinion.

Oh bitcoin has more adoption than gold does it, can you forward me a link?.
You can buy things faster with bitcoin than gold ehh, I can buy things faster than both with my debit card.
Gold won’t ever be mainstream ummm that’s why it’s been around for over 4000 years ��, how mainstream do you want?.
It easy to use coins we’ve been doing it for thousands of year, not many complain, but it’s easier to use plastic debit cards than Bitcoin also and the payments are faster.
I’m not sure what you mean by your coding question but by your knowledge of the subjects you’re talking about on reddit I’d keep clear of anything you’d coded hahaha.

Yes I agree, do coinbase automatically send you those details annually or do you have to apply to them for that information?
Secondly I’m presuming when you have these purchase details it is then up to you to work out your tax liabilities?.
My main gripes with classing BTC as an asset is clearly it can’t compete with more traditional payments because of the tax implications “IMO”.
Further more I see this as a way of making crypto less attractive to the masses therefore protecting companies and visa and MasterCard ect and their shareholders.
Having a system where in one country you pay no tax or a reduced percentage compared to another is ridiculous, and knowing how severe the United States is on tax matters makes the US probably the most unfavourable country I’d personally want to live in.

So you’re expecting everyone to believe a decentralised currency that can circumnavigate sanctions ect is likely to be shown more leniency than one that a central bank decided to create?.
Centralisation makes regulation easier and makes those companies easier to keep in line, I don’t figure your thoughts on this issue.
No FBs Libra is a crypto currency albeit centralised of course it has implications for other crypto “you say anything coming from FB will be challenged” what won’t anything coming from bitcoin be challenged then, or are they going to say it’s ok it’s BTC that’s just fine?.
I don’t think Europe and the US are favourable at all to crypto “they’re said they don’t like it, they’ve said they will regulate it, they’ve said it will comply.
Following the above many financial companies have been bombarding the governments for more regulation on bitcoin as they feel at a disadvantage.
I could go on “there are more negatives than positives” only because it’s a tiny market do they put up with it, that can change though.
As for market manipulation can be changed there’s no signs of that happening any time soon as the liquidity needed to do what you’ve said is massive “and the market isn’t growing at any speed” supply and demand is show in the price.

Yes that was what I thought also, which is fine for an investment but for a currency I don’t think it works.
But yet again this is retarded authority that is using the same laws that exist for old school investment, when all they had to do was keep capital gains tax on sales but when used for purchases they could or should treat crypto as a currency and hence there wouldn’t be tax or confusion.
And the two are definable if you step back and look at the bigger picture.

Probably there are a lot of people who also think Bitcoin has a flaw like you’ve sited “Bitcoin price would collapse if miners saw it as unprofitable to mine”, but because the difficulty adjusts up or down that won’t happen, really this is the genius part and when you get it you’re more likely to invest IMO.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:31:30
 No they hodl it because they are trying by hodling to limit supply and artificially keep prices high.
Just like grain traders store wheat and restrict what goes onto the market “it’s away of pushing prices higher” when demand increases so does price and they bring out their stored wheat and sell it.
Or a bad crop season may mean higher prices so you can then sell your stored wheat at higher prices.
Problem bitcoin has it’s not in demand like wheat so it’s model can’t sustain that buy in everyone’s so desperate for.
You’re learning lots today young teddy ��.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:08:01
He’s calling you names because he know you’re right about fiat is better than bitcoin for general sales, that’s why they’re slapped a capital gains tax on purchases made in Bitcoin.
Kinda means you should log every sale and file your tax gains in your tax report, it means government fiat always has the advantage of being tax free.

No that’s a double spend irrelevant of, any bitcoin transaction that doesn’t get an adequate amount of confirmations can be taken advantage of in this way.
That’s why you have to wait for a minimum of 6 confirmations.

Do you mind me running something past you?.
I know it doesn’t matter who satoshi is and I don’t think anyone will find out unless they come forward, but many people have guessed about who he or she could be and I think they’re all completely wrong.
My take on this invention is this, like you’ve said the coding wasn’t great and there were mistakes some are really bad mistakes, now virtually every candidate put forward had either cryptographic degrees or computer science degrees,those people do not seem to me they would make the mistakes that were made.
The person who created Bitcoin seems like a random person with a tenacious personality “bit like a dog with a bone” also he clearly worked for a living as the Pizza guy said he only ever emailed at weekends “seems he or she worked in the week”, I believe Laszlo hanyecz helped satoshi with ironing out bugs in the code, maybe he didn’t have time or maybe he was struggling with certain aspects and truly needed help.
So I think he is really just a person no one special or other worldly.
You know that person we all meet in life who makes something and when they tell you they made it you’re awestruck as to how long it took to make or how patient they must have  been, that for me is the personality of this kinda person.
I’m not convinced either that BTC was created because of the 2008/2009 financial crash I think it was more coincidence, you see E GOLD and previous forms of electronic cash had been thought about before and I think he took up that torch because others had given in “Andreas even said he’s dismissed the Bitcoin idea because he thought it would just be another hoax so to speak.

Oh I see because the bitcoin market is so big the US government lose money thanks for pointing that out.
People in that country can still sell things for bitcoins and buy things with bitcoins, yes you’re correct but they’d have  no monetary link anymore with fiat currency “that means they’d have no value”, only fools like you would accept them the rest would use fiat that’s backed by the government that banned bitcoin payments.
Yes they can transact in person you’re right they’d be super dumb though doing so by this point wouldn’t they, may as well give your money away.
They could use those exchanges yes but those exchanges don’t have the capacity coinbase does , “Bisq is Slowwwww” and just because they run off a TOR network doesn’t mean they can’t be shut down look at pirate bay and alpha bay and many more.
Yes I’m sure if Bitcoins market it struggling like it is now that it would do so much better if it was banned and you took its life blood away, maybe it would be massive then ��.
It doesn’t stop bitcoin blocks being produced “you mean transaction that are set into blocks”, looks like from where I’m standing now it’s underground there isn’t many transactions happening?.
Oh those miners will be so bored, how are they paying for all their hardware and electric oh and their wages ��, I’m sure they’ll be happy it  is underground now.

National security laws are the hardball laws they can implement very quickly, you don’t have to kill Bitcoin “all they have to do is disrupt its price bad enough” as this will cause it to crash as the selling begins.
Basically it will eat it’s self alive because it’s market will disintegrate.

You’ve saying it is needed like the internet but it’s not is it because you’re relying on disaster and catastrophe in your business model so to speak.
As for bugs read this if you think bugs can’t still exist you’re wrong, they can and if they’re found by the wrong people and used BTC is over as all faith goes because people say it can be done yet when it has or is “bye bye bitcoin “.
Investing in digital code is super risky.
As for store of value the person who lost investing at 15k has lost, you’re now talking about if and maybe that the price will go back up and no one knows that “most predictions are complete BS even those from seasoned traders in other markets “ because it’s roulette city not investment.
And as for liquidity this argument always makes me chuckle don’t get me wrong I know the effects on more money entering a new market but that’s the point “where is this money”the bitcoin price versus demand says there isn’t that many new people entering that means there is no new money.
What gives?
Time and again people make excuses IMO.

Yeah you’re correct for sure, but it’s true that through greed the west has bought and bought more and more Chinese products “simply because the west cannot compete with a labour force so large and paid so little”.
No matter what industry the west has the Chinese will destroy their grip on it, and they do that buy using a massive work force that’s paid far less than their western counterparts.
The west creates the demand “NOT CHINA”, all China does is sell to the west.
Our own greed for cheap consumables has destroyed in part our own industries, laying waste once thriving industries that are now no more than ghost towns.
Like trumps trade war, it’s not a war because China will cripple the USA already faltering economy, and until on mass the western man or women stops buying the products they sell they will just become bigger and the west will become less dominant in the future.
So IMO it’s got a great deal to do with what we buy.

Please don’t lie and say other wise as it’s usage as a medium of payment is miniature compared to traditional payment rails.

Most people who believe in a true BTC protocol in the respect of privacy and true anonymity can see Meshnets offer true offline transactions, if you read the links and listen to some of Blockstream devs you should see if Meshnets we able also to scale they aren’t the compromise LN surely will be.
I don’t believe anyone who was into BTC early doors likes LN or centralisation as it cures no problems, it just makes BTC a speculative asset for greedy people who think it’s the path to easy riches.

He’s deluded in the extreme, he needs to read in and throughout history about banned substances and ideas, if he did he’d realise that no ban has ever worked as all you do is force the system underground.
If banning is so easy they’d have do it already, they can’t ban TOR neither can they ban crypto.
And it’s not crypto that’s trying to destroy banks as some people may put it, “NO ITS THE BANKS” destroying their own system with money mid management.

I said hash rate when the price is going lower drops of a cliff, let’s put it another way if today someone says the hash rate is at record highs if price follows hash rate then so should BTC price be at record highs “it’s not” and there are many instances proving this.
I pointed out it’s clear when price drops it does go down, if you want to call that following price then I’d agree.
But I still say that hash rate and price are not that correlated in the upward way.

If you sold to a friend it’s a trade, so you’d pay tax on any gain you’d made while you’d held the crypto “that’s for you to work out when you sell”, if there was no gain you’d report it as such, if there was a loss then you’d offset the loss”your responsibility”.
Now your friend has the crypto he or she know the purchase price they’ve paid so same applies to them when they sell.
Your friend isn’t responsible for your tax and transactions and neither are you for his.
It’s a taxable event crypto to crypto, hard forks and using it as a payment rail “all gains taxable”.

A lot of room for increased adoption, yet there is no adoption, what are you basing your theory on?, some mythical crystal ball you have?, as the original poster commented and as I said it is hypocritical to surmise future increases without solid price movement, meaning it could as likely go to zero.
And let’s keep to the facts about BTC holders, this may help you in that endeavour 
Saying oh because there are 8 billion people and Bitcoin was once 20k, or bitcoin was Zero and now is “X amount”, doesn’t mean anything, facts are facts, take a look at the price.
Think about it, as you said “NOT SO FAR FETCHED”, based on what? Uhhhh all the people buying in?, well they are clearly are  not buying in, so your comments are far fetched.

You’ve answered your question NO you don’t know, everything else you’ve said is more of the same hearsay at best.
Blockchain isn’t even that impressive, it’s slow.
Fiat doesn’t have artificial demand, especially the dollar, it has demand because it has stable value, really comparing bitcoins to the dollar is childish.
BTC only has value because of its security, if it’s security ever becomes eroded for varying different reasons, who’s going to want it.
Bitcoin is very price dependent, I’m afraid also it has many more flaws.
Successful viruses spread very fast, and a pandemic is the worst case scenario, they are on everyone’s lips, through fear of becoming a victim, you’ll hear people talking about it where ever you go.
Bitcoin isn’t even at virus stage, apart from talk forums like this and meet ups behind closed doors, no ones talking, and for this reason you realise it’s minuscule.

It’s price is based on tether printing and manipulation, there’s no real value because no one know its real value “probably about $1000 dollars max”.
That’s what they said about MySpace and look what happened there anyone who believes Bitcoin is a guaranteed win is a fool.
Tens of million are using it “they are not” offer your proof to contradict the proof I’ve shown you.
You don’t understand money that well do you, people don’t retire by using fiat money because it’s stable for a reason, BTC is a pyramid scheme that rewards early investors or the suckers who invest later.
I know this because back in 2018 myself and others I know were making £500k plus per day in a matter of hours, all down to a massive manipulated bubble backed by tether printing with absolutely no intrinsic value to back the hype.
You are trying to tell me bullshit, Bitcoin can’t function on a global scale it has to many faults and LN just doesn’t work properly.

You can’t divide Asia and the US and Europe and the rest of the world, the ecosystem is one its not divided.
Utter rubbish you speak, simply on supply and demand you or anyone should know the price is “low”if you’re correct the price would be way higher.
I am not interested in OTC trades as their not registered so anyone can submit false info on the amount of BTC being sold and who is buying.
So no I won’t think again as my analogy is based on facts supply to demand.
If you offer up some proof I’ll take a look.

�� oh you can’t so much for BTC changing the worlds unbanked, oh and LN needs all of those thing to function and so does Bitcoin.
Oh and all those poor people who’ll have to load  LN channels with BTC before they can even participate in LN “POOR PEOPLE”.
I’m pissing myself laughing.
You also lose censorship resistance by using LN, you’ll find as many have pointed out its centralised not “decentralised but you’ll ignore that ��
Authority can sure shut BTC down by taking away on and off ramps and also because it’s weak point is it’s need for an internet connection.
Meshnets set out to give BTC it’s true decentralised and private nature without the fear of ever being shut down, why would anyone who supports BTC be against that vision is beyond me.

Well firstly Bitcoin isn’t really a currency it falls short in a lot of respects.
Bitcoins price increases have less to do with who’s buying in than how many tether tokens are and have been printed, a lot of the 2018 bull run was pure tether printing.
Also speculators and market manipulation have effect on the price that’s why it’s swings can be huge.
The demand is simply not high for its supply if it was anywhere near outstripping its supply it would be worth thousands more “it is not” and neither have any of BTCs price increases been sustainable, if you cannot sustain the buying and keep demand high it always loses its gains.
The above is why savvy traders play suckers in this market and make a killing.
You can have ownership that’s fine your keys your coins, but it’s got huge hurdles to climb believe me.
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:08:40
Yeah of course it’s not possible, seems the guys at samurai wallet think it’s possible.
Just like with BTC the double spend of digital tokens was deemed impossible, until satoshi did it.
Nick szabo clearly wouldn’t have a clue what he’s talking about now would he ��.
What did you tell me about go reading?
Maybe you should spend sometime reading this.
Oh and by the way the above is Blockstream, they also see off line payments as the future of BTC “satellites and Meshnets”.
Read away my little friend.
@_date: 2019-10-13 11:13:02
The details of those payments though are not recorded on the Blockchain are they?.
That’s the point of having off chain transactions isn’t it?. 
As regards AML and KYC I think you’ll find the LN network will fall into trouble because main stream payment providers will operate and under strict rules, then of course they’re going to demand regulators make LN payments do the same surely “I would”.
Almost impossible to shut down how so?.
Anyone who uses visa or MasterCard all transaction are recorded I can and they can simply prove what I bought when I bought it and for how much, you don’t have to do that will LN channels that’s why it’s a criminals paradise in some ways.

But they do give total security because no internet connection is required and they also give  total censorship resistance, I believe the latter is the holy grail.
LN seems fine but we all know it has limitations and other issues “not saying those issues won’t be sorted out”, but still it’s not as secure as a transaction on a mesh network.
If block sizes can be increased and worked over a mesh network surely that would be a killer app, but I feel someone’s going to say it can’t be done.

Having no emotional ties to Bitcoin or the idea of Bitcoin makes it easier to dump when the times are right, unlike those who think it’s going to change the world and society because it won’t.

Hash rate has nothing to do with price the price of a Bitcoin is based solely on how many retail investors buy into the market and how many tether tokens are printed into existence, and then the speculation and of course the manipulation.
Hash rate soon drops off a cliff if the price tanks sure because Bitcoins become to expensive to mine.
Miners only hang around so long playing a game that eats into previous profits, if the price doesn’t rise they’ll cut off the power and sit on the sidelines.

That’s a very hypocritical statement, one that’s often used on reddit and it’s endorsing what the guy is stating, here is why.
Because you rightly state about 5% of people, or to be more exact 5.8 million in total own BTC, but no one else is buying in, we clearly know this through supply and demand and only an utter fool or liar would state different, so you’re kinda stating something that’s not reality, just because “this or just” so to speak doesn’t  mean it in will work in real world terms.
The facts are and always have been, BTC price rises rely on other investors, if they come it will go up, if they leave it goes down.

I’d agree in part, definitely agree amazon would have a ready made market for sales “and its markets and large ones that count”.
FB are more likely to bend to regulators though with a centralised crypto.
Bitcoin simply hasn’t got a ready made market and has no direct spokesperson so is on the fringes of regulators and that’s why they don’t like it and it’s market isn’t likely to spread as far.
@_date: 2019-10-12 03:14:35
No I don’t think it will happen, but you never know people who are into bitcoin are no more than a modern day movement.
Take away on and off ramps and close all exchanges outlaw it’s use in shops, believe me it’s value would dry up as people sold off.
It would end up being pure fools gold for anyone stupid enough not to have sold when the news broke.
No government likes tools that let terrorist by pass sanctions “just that alone would allow the US government to wheel out draconian form of banning”.
It’s ridiculous to state they couldn’t kill it.
And they wouldn’t be left behind they just chose something centralised without the speculaitive nature BTC has.
Software like BTCS can be copied and copied into eternity, the only thing at present unique about BTC is miners making huge profits and pooling  large amounts of computing power “turn that off voluntarily because the money isn’t there or match computing power on another new chain and you’ve got another Bitcoin” not unique in anyway really.
Look here is a classic example more companies pulling away from facebooks libra because it’s dead in the water “way to bigger a threat” they’ll never let it unstable traditional finance, these firms are pulling out because they don’t want heavy handed regulators looking closer at them.

They can do that yes, they have the money know how and the space for crypto farms, but the problem is they’ll never be decentralised and they’ll always need extra crypto in times of need.
Governments can’t control debt, they simply cannot function on a currency that’s fixed in the system they originally created.
Bitcoin is very similar to a gold standard and the USA came of that for various reasons, but one being they needed more money than they held in gold, “war isn’t cheap”, and hence why today they are not on any pegged asset system.

The whole idea of open source with BTC was to give others the opportunity to go different ways and create different coins with varying features, but anyone who’s pumping money into those shit coins should have realised long ago that the developers involved in BTC can implement any features as long as they’re comparable, and if they aren’t compatible they can work something from scratch.
BTC needs to be anonymous, if the sender doesn’t want tracing he or she should have that choice.
If BTC doesn’t become private and non traceable it will fail, because it is then no different to any other payment system that we have in the mainstream now.

Yes same issue with mine, but if I hit the max withdrawal and I am denied, it will prompt me the maximum amount I can withdraw, frustratingly it isn’t far of the maximum withdrawal amount so I always have a small amount left in the wallet,  now that small amount left in the wallet can be withdrawn at a later date as long as the fees are covered, but it should withdraw completely with the max amount.
Maybe it is a bug like has been pointed out and if so they should address it immediately.
I did wonder whether it was a way of them keeping crypto in wallets and making money in extra fees, because you’re having to do two withdrawals instead of the one, as we have had campaigns encouraging people to keep no crypto in exchange wallets (which I’m in agreement on), just though I’d see what others views were or find out if I was the only one having this issue, seems now I am not, thanks for the reply.

And where is the demand for bitcoins?
Considering the majority of its price is made from speculators and tether printing?
Demand for speculation “gambling not investing”, isn’t usage, bitcoins aren’t used they’re stored in wallets with the hope someone will pay more for them than the person who bought them earlier.
Drugs are used they have usage, banning drugs didn’t increase price because the price of drugs was liquid because demand is high.
Why don’t you show me proof of how high demand for Bitcoin is apart from speculators.
Why do you think it’s price is tanking? That is because there’s more selling than buying.
And if Bitcoins only use is to buy drugs on a dark net it’s real time price would be dollars, miners wouldn’t mine transactions if that was its only use because it was outlawed.
You sound about 10 years old and have been listening to other clueless college kids on reddit repeating the same lame arguments.
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:39:57
No one can answer that because there will be alternatives come along over the next 10 or 20 years and anyone may dethrone BTC.
If you don’t have adoption which “be sure about” is extremely slow at present because there are faster easier traditional payments systems already around that people prefer using and feel more secure using.
People will tell you yes because they’re already convinced BTC will moon “reality checks predict that it will not because there are not enough buyers”, as for the future if that stayed the same those TX fees wouldn’t be enough to sustain the electric cost and hence networks security.
BTC is not a given nor is it a failure “it’s a big wait and see”.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:17:04
Yes you’re right you do pay tax on your wages that are paid in fiat, then when you pay for goods with the Bitcoins you’ve bought and there is a gain on those bitcoins you pay tax again.
That’s called capital gains tax, you don’t pay capital gains on fiat as it’s not property it is currency.
So why would anyone choose to pay tax twice when you can buy the same thing without being taxed twice.
Oh and you are still levied with VAT on purchases with BTC as well as cash “except with the cash you don’t incur a gains tax” you’ll maybe understand better if I send you a link do you want one?.
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:56:42
So if you’ve got 10 million people who own bitcoins a week before the halvening and 5 million sell up, you think that the cut in supply for 1800 to 900 per day will cause a price increase?.
Irrespective of the fact that 5 million people have just sold their stock of Bitcoins ��.
I would of logically thought that 5 million people’s BTC being sold on the market and the fact that 5 million less people are participating in holding Bitcoins would lower the prices “irrespective” of supply.
Prices only rise consistently higher when demand outstrips supply, even satoshi Nakamoto can’t guarantee public demand.

Bitcoins have private keys that are so sensitive it’s impossible to trust anyone with the information relating to them.
So people can drop dead taking their secret key with them, there are many such cases, this isn’t a problem with mainstream financial products.
It is bitcoins problem, and only a tiny percentage of people will want the responsibility or the hassle connected with it, and this is another reason BTC mass adoption won’t ever happen.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:29:50
You are partly right but not completely, anything you buy with crypto is taxable, any gain on any crypto is taxable.
And the part about most BTC holders just hold is correct but totally out of context because they’ll not hold for ever, most people who own crypto will pay tax when they cash out, and these individuals will leaving them selves with large capital gains taxes.
BTC was touted as an anonymous way to transact originally yet we now know it’s clearer than ice.
And the idea for crypto wasn’t because the banks got bailed out, nakamoto idea was floated in emails on the internet in 2002 way earlier than 2008s bail ins or bail outs, so this misconception that digital currencies were completely developed because banks did bad is Bollocks frankly, it just was coincidence.
And also people do win trading, there are many smart people who have gained or built up a large stash of BTC by cashing in gains for more BTC than they had before.
Over taxation, lack of anonymity, high transaction costs and fees, and a system so opaque i can check you business profits just by checking an open Ledger will eventually finish BTC.
You still think paying tax on the money you buy BTC with and then paying more tax when you sell of fine “go for it” personally I think not and I believe each TX should be shielded unless that person chooses to be identified.
If you read the article it clearly stated that out of 14000 individuals only 800 returned a tax return, that support what I’ve said.
Oh and exchanges may well fall in line, or should I say centralised ones, BIsq and other that are decentralised won’t and this will spawn more exchanges that they can’t touch.
Ironically I like the part where this individual is taking credit for Silk Road, but that didn’t matter because last time I checked drugs were easily available on TOR so in reality the IRS did sweet fuck all.

If it’s price drops to the point miners can’t be arsed to maintain the network security, prices will evaporate as more people sell, basically the market and BTCs security die a death.
There are far to many attack vectors in play for BTC to survive like it did in the early days, if BTCs hash power became so low, any rouge players could attack its network, fine while it has interest and security (not so when it hasn’t), no one works for free.
Tax authorities only accept BTC because they transfer it into dollars, and BTC is valued in dollars ������‍♂️, so that’s not working on me and never has, they’ll get tax from what ever, then if it disappears they’ll go back to dollars.
5.8 million people word wide owning it, isn’t everyone turning an eye to it, this is pure wishful thinking, or delusion.
Ummm grow till it finds its stable value, no I don’t think it will, BTC would have to have way more liquidity, some say a price of over 280k dollars, and we know the BTC bubbles collapse way before they ever get close, cycles always repeat, personally I think it will die, and be taken over.
I cannot remember hearing anyone talk about it in public for at least a year, and then most had never heard of it, as I said no one cares, they have functioning things now that work fine.

Yeah the plan sounds good, take out initial investment when prices increase leaving you with Bitcoin, all said and done if you do it that way you’ve nothing to lose in the future.
Even if you add more as time goes on taking profits gets you your initial investment back also.

So when I wanted to withdraw £100 in BTC, it gave me a daily withdrawal amount lower than this figure, meaning i had to leave a small amount in the wallet?.
Most of the time it does this now, with withdrawals, where as before you could withdraw the whole amount.
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:49:31
The price doesn’t *have to* go up per unit, the price per unit will only go up if the *demand  is there*, or demand higher than supply.
It’s not a given just because there are less available this is what people don’t understand or they presume Bitcoins price on a future demand scenario (which is BS).
At present there is no demand, we can clearly see this and have done for over a year, demand lower than supply will see prices fall, which we have.
So if you had a halvenings today, clearly low demand is in operation so logically I’d doubt you’d see any price gains.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:48:45

You already made the price accusation by saying it can go up based on the fact there are 8 billion people and that only a few people have owned it, that may be correct about how many have owned it, but like i pointed out it’s hypocritical to say it may go up, but not go down, when in all truth the arrows point more at a downward trend than an upward one.
Supply and demand doesn’t lie people do, of course you’re done because you have no evidence, you bring nothing to the table and cast accusations of stupid towards others, when realistically you’ve not thought things out properly.
The exit door is over there the best option for you is run for it before I carve you up.
@_date: 2019-02-02 14:44:46
Define demand higher than supply Urrrrrrr ����, it means the amount of BTC available on the market and the total amount mined per day at present 1800, that means that for sustained price rises all this BTC would have to be eaten up by the market (the public at large or other), it really isn’t difficult to understand price and demand correlation.
Whether demand is greater than zero isn’t my point, my point is demand is lower than previous price highs, meaning demand is down.
But if you can’t work out why a price of a bitcoin falls off a cliff that’s up to you, but I assure you there are more sellers than buyers each time the price drops, that in any market signals no demand.
And considering most people in this space are absolutely clueless about how many people actually own  BTC worldwide (shockingly low figure of only 5.8 million), then it doesn’t surprise me either that they are clueless what a price may mean when related with demand ��‍♂️.
A price can be anywhere and signal there is no demand, house prices don’t go to zero do they, but that market will and does suffer times of no demand, so house prices stagnate or drop (fall of a cliff), this equals no demand.
Ok with BTC you could say little demand if that makes the pill sweeter for you to swallow, prices not at zero, but either way you have a market that’s full of “BS”, with more speculation and manipulation than real buyers effecting the price in an upward manner, which you’d expect in a buoyant market, or a healthy market.
So if you factor in both manipulation and speculation of the BTC price, realistically it’s probably worth even less, so demand is probably even lower than the price figure we see today.
I wouldn’t go picking as you’ll not like what you find !!!!.
Like many have been told in this space, dreams of million dollars bitcoins are just carrots being dangled so bigger fools put their money into a pyramid scheme, of greater fool investment, when as I’ve shown you the price tells all about the health of a market and its goods.
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:30:43

I don’t think that’s going to protect your identity or your financial crypto affairs for long.
One example would be if you cash out into a bank account at anytime, they can then see all payments you’ve had go in and trace them back, there isn’t a percent any completely secure way of shielding yourself long term, not unless you never need fiat.
IMO buying selling unless done in cash the most and best privacy currency, they’ll be a trace of it’s done electronically.

Global coin doesn’t look like it’s going to escape the regulators, unlike BTC which we all love because it’s decentralised.
It looks very much like they’ll have to comply with all money laws that all other payment providers are governed by, so this isn’t ground breaking in the slightest, and because it’s centralised those laws will be forced on FB.
They simply cannot operate outside these financial systems like genuine permission less crypto’s can.

It won’t ever be that easy, because you’ll always need back up master seed words, there will always be hackers and always be security risk, when you add all those things up BTC is at a disadvantage to mainstream products that are easy and you need little thought  when interacting with them, BTC forced itself into a niche market.
And may I add niche markets seldom last long.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:44:46
It may be a new monetary good, BUT albeit one that shows little interest from the general public because it’s to volatile easily hacked if you’re not savvy and is overly complicated for average joe.
Secondly big money institutional investors have already seen a flaw in the 21 million supply “that is most coins are held by only a few “meaning” any investor needs to trust they won’t manipulate the price “and they can and they do”.
Thirdly for BTC to lose it volatility and become stable in price each BTC would need a market value of around £380,000 which IMO won’t ever happen.
Sure at the moment it’s got some promise but just because it’s where it is now is no guarantee of future price or place.
POW is extremely energy inadequate, there are going to be less hungry ways to confirm transaction, I assure you most of the public don’t care about decentralised networks they care about ease of use, and insurance against loss.
Also when you are on reddit no one listens when you point out how few people are actually buying BTC, you may say how do I know this and like everyone I’d say look at the price if you had masses of support and buying the 1800 BTC mined per day would be eaten up and the price would rocket FOMO, simply it’s not happening.
As regards what will replace it probably a coin that’s centralised in reality as the public don’t care.
As an example as soon as the fed print more money horror stories on Reddit come out saying it’s the end of the dollar the end of money, it is not the federal reserve can print as much money as they like because they pay no interest on it so it is literally free money.
BTC is a big risk.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:47:26
Retail investors are the general public, the Bitcoin price is solely made up of retail interest or trader and whale manipulation “the latter is clear from time to time”.
There may be some over the counter sales for  wealthier individual and certain investment firms have accumulated BTC, but I assure you most institutional investors will not touch BTC because they don’t like the security aspects of it or the regulation that goes with it.
That’s why BAKKT are here in this space to give those people what they want.
Believe me if you’re physically settling contracts with BTC and opening the doors to these deep pocketed people the price will eventually moon.
It has “NOT YET”to the degree that would signal a huge influx of institutional money.
This is clear reason most of the BTC price is retail.
Even with BAKKT it will take time for BTC to become harder to buy due to less supply on the market, but it will happen for sure though.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:31:21
Well there you go “you’d pay with fiat” that’s also what the masses think.
As for the paintings the analogy is silly as they’re are seen as solid investments not currency.
But you’re wrong about gold “truly wrong” gold throughout history has been minted and used as payment in coin form, and could still be if chosen.
Gold has utility and it is a true store of value, if you’re talking about gold bars weighing a few kilos yeah sure they’re not much good as money, but poor people don’t own them so it irrelevant.
I think the guys right personally no one runs for Bitcoins they’re too volatile, safe money buys bonds and gold.

Problem with his analogy is those problems he speaks of are often short lived as out of chaos always comes calm and stability.

I asked you on what evidence the price will increase back to 20k, what you’re proposing is using past price on future prediction, that’s not evidence, it’s guess work at best, or pure speculation at worst.
What I said is, based on what evidence, what proof.
I can say my house price will increase by “X amount”, because it used to be “X price”, but I cannot guarantee any such price gains, it may in fact go south rather than north.

Yes you can use Lloyd’s debit card on coinbase and you can use their accounts to receive funds, BUT! You may find that their fraud department often flags transactions linked to crypto exchanges and if you ask them why they will rely by saying coinbase or other has lots of fraud so they believe it is customer security If they Block the transaction.
Basically they can’t stop you using your own money, but expect periodically to be on the phone getting the Block on your card removed.

My comparison to Libra is a fair guide for how far Bitcoin will ultimately be allowed to go by regulators, simply if Libra is facing hurdles and is centralised and more opaque than BTC because it’s centralised a decentralised system like BTC will find it harder and harder to comply with regulations.
I don’t buy that the technology is the thing limiting adoption as I just don’t believe that people will change from what’s available now, I mean what’s available now is so simple to use and has many benefits over using crypto.
Price swings in Bitcoin are 
1) tether printing
2)trader manipulation “whale wallets”
3)news feeds good or bad
4)miners manipulation as they either control prices through “selling or hoarding”.
5) a combination of the above.
No one will ever no the real value of a Bitcoin until the market is completely regulated to eliminate this manipulation.
Two European countries have already said Libra wouldn’t be allowed to operate in their countries, Bitcoin wouldn’t also be allowed to disrupt financial districts in the west “for sure” IMO.
And I agree the only reason they’ve not strangled it is because the market is so small compared to traditional financial markets it’s not worth their time but if that changed which by user base it doesn’t look likely I think they’d act, it is on their radar.

���� exactly, don’t think that just because it has a pyramid structure it is bad, many things that exist are based on the same principle.
But yes to sustain growth and keep value, you’ll always rely on a new buyer, that’s why he made them divisible, so the entry level for buying in was available to all people, regardless of their financial situation.
Prices only ever go high when the existing products availability becomes rarer, or less abundant, and also for it to sustain those high prices its supply has to have that constant demand.
Anyone who would argue otherwise is wrong, you can’t really factor in manipulation ect, because you’ll never have real figure, but the basics of supply and demand have the same outcomes.

I’d agree that speculators push markets and prices forward, but I don’t think because a market price moves up fast it’s a death knell so to speak, I believe retail investors can screw a market up through their inexperience in many ways but when we are talking about BAKKT and these other big players this may give BTC far more of a solid price floor, humps and bumps along this path won’t spell doom imo.

So what is the tax rate one pays when using this card for a purchase?.
And do you know if the fee is a set fee, or is the fee payable to the miners dependent on the items cost?.
Myself I’m not convinced payments can compete with fiat as fiat has no tax as it is classed as currency and not an asset.
Do you have an example you could share?.
I think until bitcoin loses that tax liability on purchases it can’t compete.
Tax of this mature on purchases is pure theft and those tax laws need to be destroyed in some way going forward.

You know the people who make money out of Bitcoins they’re the smart ones who make money because they sell when it’s high, and they sell also when they think it’s going down.
Then they buy back in at lower levels, everyone else who holds loses profit and supports the top people because they buy those dips.

Plus you value BTC in dollars, I don’t care what your unit price is valued in, as we can clearly see its trajectory, which is down.
More sellers than buyers ��, ummm of course in bitcoin land that statement would be wrong, as it doesn’t work for holders like you, but in a real world market supply and demand is clear at present, and for sure it’s showing more sellers than buyers, that’s why you’re trapped in a bear market, your statements are hilarious ����, in fact cringe worthy.

I see it slightly differently, I think if you’re not seeing sustained price grown when prices are low, your less likely to see prices go high, as it shows at the present time people aren’t interested enough to buy in to push prices higher.
I think with BTC it will have a do or die moment, if it’s price doesn’t inflate through lack of interest more sell offs will resume and more value will be lost.
I don’t see it as a given, that prices must go up.

That how pyramid schemes work, if you’re in first you win “always”. 
Just like the 5000 BTC I mined in 2011.
And irrespective of if you sell, your only hope is if prices increase, maybe they will maybe they won’t, but let’s be realist anyone who bought at 20k has a lot of loss on the books, and certainly no guarantee.
This is how pyramid schemes work, last in feed the first in.

Ummm and of course a deflationary currency is the answer to the worlds woes. I mean it’s so successful, that the worlds financial power houses are lining up desperate to buy in.
They are not, neither are people only 5.8 million people own bitcoins, it’s a whisper in a crowded room.
Bitcoins like most of your reply, are based on not factual, what it actually can’t do, but may be able to do in the future argument barely facts, and of course for the adults in the world over the age of 20 years old, we’ve heard the end is nigh for along time yet here we still are,probably that’s because the dollar can’t go bankrupt unless the US decides so.
It’s a beautiful invention, being king of your own castle and currency.
And this is another reason bitcoins are a dreamers view on an ideal world, currency doesn’t even work on the bitcoins model, anyone who understands economics clearly saw this on day one,

I think most of the general public would be thinking my bank does all my upgrades for me, or I can’t remember when I had to update my debit card.
Bitcoin has miles to go before its public friendly, and even then without automatic updates it still won’t be.
In fact I know of a couple of people who haven’t even bothered with the last update, 10 years from now how many updates will people like those be behind, and how long will their crypto be there, seems being your own back isn’t so easy for some.
But may I add in all fairness, I’ve now implemented this update and it was very simple with good guidance even for the none tech out there, you really would have to be backward not to understand.
Good job Ledger.
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:06:43
How am I saying there aren’t enough to go round, I take it your maths  wasn’t the best at school?  because that’s what happens with hyperinflation , because goods cost more each day, more notes are needed daily to buy those goods, soon that money supply dries up, meaning now because prices are so extortionate they’re logically are not enough notes in circulation for everyone, thats why if you do your own home work you’ll find parts of Venezuela have issues their own paper IOUS in villages where they don’t have enough of the local currency because of price rises.
If prices keep rising sooner or later you’ll fall short of notes in supply, even if you’re printing physical notes which often isn’t true because it’s easier to create money through accounting procedures, printing money cost money.
You are  ill informed, as it’s simple maths supply versus demand based on prices rising constantly.
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:58:59
I don’t worry about anything because I have millions��, the point I was making is that BTC has a massive bridge to cross through laziness, you still haven’t understood the post, or aren’t able to apprehend the consequences of this lazy human attitude.
Oh and just one response to your bragging jibe, when I mined BTC, they were less than 50pence in uk value, I know people who had loads more than me, so at that time it wasn’t a big deal, if you’d have been active then, which you clearly weren’t you’d have probably said you weren’t interested yourself, or you’d have seen no value as many did, and I can testify to this.
Only now there is definite gain in that value of those coins are people interested, you wouldn’t have said to someone back then their bragging, or that their reddit account hasn’t long been active now would you?

Could you now rewind and point out anything what you’ve said that isn’t a “maybe or an if”, just one thing based on fact that you can prove?.
My point being what’s the point of a hypothetical conversation, they mean nothing, moreover there is more evidence pointing to less and slower adoption than adoption.
You see your theory is flawed just by adoption rates over the last 10 years especially as they are today, and without adoption BTC isn’t going anywhere.
Also your maths isn’t very good, I mean you talk of a 1 million dollar bitcoin, but that isn’t anywhere near enough to fuel an economy, even if each satoshi was worth 1 million with a population likely to hit 15 billion in the future BTC falls well short.
Plus you should check out deflationary currency and how it really doesn’t work in a working economy for reasons I stated earlier.
All this info is freely available and when you add up all BTCs pitfalls, the sensible conclusion is dollar demand with always outstrip bitcoins, just for the sheer volumes interacted with in the above link, and as I pointed out people won’t spend it enough for it to even get close to these volumes.
I’m afraid it’s a speculative white elephant, that the early comers have got rich on, and still will off the late people getting in.

@_date: 2019-01-27 07:44:22
I agree that 2 generation crypto will eventually unseat Bitcoin, if only one of those coin can keep everything on a secure Blockchain without the need for 2nd and third layers that gives it a security advantage as long as it can gain as much harsh power as Bitcoin, and because BTC is losing miners through its price lowering and also because it’s user base is realistically small at only 5.8 million holders, then it possible for it to make way for another.
And clearly you are correct, as I’ve pointed out many times on reddit, simply the best time for buying is when prices are low, now even if there are people buying, they certainly are not buying enough to put a strain on supply, otherwise we’d see constant price rises.
For me this supply and price correlation clearly shows BTC isn’t being adopted as some would like you to believe in the hype push, to keep BTC dominant.
As for the “LN” network, I’m personally not convinced of its security, NAKAMOTOS,S vision wasn’t an added layer for the sole sake of rescuing a failed scaling issue, simply put BTC should have died back then and they should have moved on.
Also on the Subject of “LN”, this system on its own isn’t a saviour for bitcoin, as bitcoin doesn’t do anything, and it’s value only comes from the speculation side, the only way bitcoin becomes valued is through real people using it in the real world, and those figures at the moment are no where near causing a challenge to any traditional payment methods.
Plus crypto currency in general are complicated for the non tech savvy, give anyone in that situation a choice and they’ll choose cash or card.
And that’s without the security issues of being your own bank, simply put these are huge hurdles BTC and others are not winning.
My personal opinion this year is more loses, and I think if BAKKT don’t get permission for Physically backed BTC futures contracts, you’ll see massive sell offs as people exit a markets and a coin that’s producing no value.
Clearly lots of people see it the same and are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see how low this is going, and how much it will effect BTC reputation, clearly only a fool would buy it at SUB $1500 dollar prices as if it gets that low, there isn’t nothin stopping it going to ZERO.
Miners would be running for the exit doors.

Maybe you should read this, then add up the other things I’ve told you, then decide whether bitcoins are cheaper than cash, debit, or credit card purchases, bearing in mind we in the UK don’t pay surcharges.

@_date: 2019-01-15 10:56:37
Hahaha, anyone who spends or says spend bitcoin knows nothing about money and how money works, it’s a classic sign of being Mia informed.
You always spend the less valued currency, for the service you deem worth more than the currency in your pocket.
For example I don’t like washing my car, I’d rather someone else do it, that person has a rate or cost which he will preform the service for, I then decide if that service is worth more than the currency in my pocket.
Pocket one Bitcoin,
Pocket two fiat.
Clearly his service to me is worth more because I don’t want to wash the car, and clearly the fiat is worth less than the Bitcoin, so spending the latter shows you have no understanding of money.
Spending bitcoins doesn’t increase its value, just as spending fiat doesn’t increase its value, I mean a $20 note loses a certain amount per year, where BTC should gain.
So spending won’t do anything for its value, hodling and limiting the open supply will of course.
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:03:33
No that’s incorrect as David chaums early version of E gold didn’t cure the double spend problem and it was also more centralised.
BTC was the first to do this incorporating a Blockchain based upon, Ralph Merkle (Merkle tree).
LOL, I wouldn’t say mimblewimble hasn’t got improvements over elements in BTC, geez and many of those 2000 coin do things sure better than BTC today (right here right now), I can send a Litecoin payment on chain faster, and it confirms faster, and it can also implement anything BTC can just as one example.
There are many coming that aren’t pre mined and have limited supply based on proof of work, they just implement other aspects with different tech.
Beam for example is one
Elixxir is another 
5.8 million was the conclusion of an in-depth study partaken by Cambridge university, you’ll find most people in bitcoin are solely mis informed.

So you think volatile currency, or asset as Bitcoin is classed by the regulators, is better than holding currency that’s always in high demand and thus less volatile, meaning less risky.
I’ve seen 8 crashes since my time in bitcoin, all have had and meant a huge drop in the price, the largest drop to date of over 80%, When you understand these drops can come at anytime by bad market sentiment or pure manipulation, you’d certainly realise the risk involved, you only have to look at the people out there who have negative value in their bitcoin holding, all due to these devastating drops in value.
That’s logically the reason why most people choose stable alternatives, as they aren’t gambling, they are just looking for stability.

No it won’t, you’re  presuming people will spend BTC *they won’t LOL* why would I spend a coin that’s going to be worth a million.
I’ll give you a little time to ponder that one ��.
And seen as you have it all worked out, I can’t be bothered correcting you on the economics of bitcoin or a current system that works because of high dollar demand that won’t go away anytime soon.
Clearly you don’t know only 5.8 million people own BTC if you did you’d realise your predictions are laughable.

I don’t need to prove anything, that’s like me asking for you to post me screen shots of your BTC holding, that isn’t good online etiquette, surely someone who had a reddit account for so long should know this.
And because you’ve not put over a legitimate defence to any of the the posts views, or for that matter showed how your proposed “future and if scenarios actually work in real practice”, you’ve now reverted to insults and calling me a troll.

I believe most currencies float against one another, it’s called a floating exchange rate, so it’s the forex market that sets currency prices on a supply and demand basis.
That said I think also some currencies have a set rate, which is fixed by the governments of those countries.
But an equilibrium price give more stability.

Central banks are not interested in buying Bitcoins, for the simple reason all of their currencies world wide have mass demand, the kind of demand Bitcoin wants and dreams of.
The problem comes in bitcoins dream because it has to compete with currencies with constant huge demand, that for this reason have less volatility and store value better, and in a safer way.
All central banks and governments have to do is not buy bitcoins, they just make all bitcoin trading ect, (futures, ETF, and anything else), settle in  dollar or other, this keeps demand on fiat currency and not bitcoin.
Believe me when I tell you, Bitcoin is already exactly where they want it, without buying any of them.
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:19:53
No maybe not, but those Cent and dollar small savings over a lifetime add up, the point is Bitcoin is touted as zero fee, or low fee compared to tradition payment rails.
My point is if the people in the ecosystem can’t even be bothered to lower fees by implementing segwit, and the populous can’t be bothered to save money where they can, through a
Lazy attitude, you’ll find they will be lazy changing from tradition methods of payment to Bitcoin.
I did write all of this previous, all you’ve done in your reply is point out part of a way larger picture, if you read again and put it all together, lazy people means slow adoption, sometimes they never adopt because they can’t be arsed.
Plus truly if you’d have been bothered to read the article in full, you would have seen these companies that have not implemented segwit, can be burning millions in fees, weekly.
That’s not cents on a dollar Buddy, that’s big money, try thinking outside of the box, you’ll realise laziness equals more cost if the former has saving benefits.

Buying BTC now is a mugs game, BTC prices are going way lower than levels today, there isn’t demand hence the lowering price due to people selling out and waiting to buy in lower.

So with respect unless everywhere is accepting bitcoins, you could in a crash situation be stuck with them?
I’m pointing this out because often when these things happen, and mass sell offs ensue, often exchanges stop people cashing out or their systems become swamped, just like bank runs.
So for me if I was in your country I would buy anything but bitcoins, just in case.
I hope you see my point, as most in this space agree further drops will come.

Decentralised = yet severely put in a box by the regulators for it to function in the real world.
First mover advantage isn’t usually a win, in fact most first movers generally find something comes along that can do it better, based of the learning of their mistakes, first mover advantage touted as a sure fire win is wrong.
Other coins run on proof of work, that’s not all bitcoin needs for a secure network, it also needs a price incentive big enough for miners to make a profit and secure the chain, also they need to cover the costs of the electric, a new coin today using proof of work has less security yes because there are less people involved, but that can change, WILL ALWAYS HAVE, that’s just wishful thinking, not economically justified.
*LN* could well work well, still you have the problem convincing people to spend what is deemed a more valuable currency, over the least valuable like fiat and debit, simply why would you, it’s like having the best and fastest train in the world but no passengers, and that’s where bitcoins LN network is heading.
This is why giant companies have never embraced bitcoin, because at present it still isn’t good enough, and Inmy opinion will never lose its hoarder mentality.
And since 2011 I have been looking, and I don’t see a revolution I see a niche market that at present is struggling to gain people adoption, only 5.8 million people own BTC, put into perspective Mexico City has a population of 120 million, that’s barely a revolution, more a meeting down the local bar ��.

In fact I’ve checked some figures and an online partition did indeed attract a million signatures, but of course putting a signature to a partition,
Doesn’t mean you’ll be an active street protestor.
So for this reason we can attain that the street protestors are far fewer in numbers than the actual partition  points too.
Now the population of Paris is 2.2 million, and the population of France is 67.2 million, for anyone looking at these figures would clearly see that the yellow vest movement is indeed niche, niche being a tiny segment.
And as I said originally the numbers never lie, “humans do”, so with bitcoins market being 5.8 million people, compared to the 8.5 billion population of the world is also clearly niche.
In fact on the mathematics there are less yellow vest protestors than bitcoin holders, so believing this or that will change the status Quo is foolish.
Oh and the french government is backed by a military force, they can at last resort use live ammunition if protests get out of hand.
The above are facts.

Instead of replying saying this and that and talking of examples with no content, please use detail and explain how, how it will work, how you’ll implement it, how it’s static fixed supply will work with a growing population, how you will control inflation in either direction, how in times of need you be able to increase the money supply, when BTC can only produce  1800 coins per day, and that is even decreasing.

Yes pretty much, you can in real world terms say that speculation is a false figure.
PayPal for instance isn’t speculated with, so it is used for transaction purposes, which are a clear win in a real world economy.
This is why so many people use alternatives that work fine, for everyday use.
I could sit here all days sending money back and forth, just like I could place numerous false bids on an item for sale on eBay, like I said it wouldn’t give a true figure, it would give a manipulated one.
But hey ho this is bitcoin land so false goes well with false.

There is no purpose behind bitcoin, it is pure speculation, this guys completely on the money, because BTC is only in demand if prices are rising, simply once it’s price  shows signs of dropping or low returns the smart people sell out and wait, pumping their money into tried and tested money making ventures.

Sorry but this is pure crap, you simply cannot have real adoption without causing supply issues, and because the bitcoin price is and has been signalling SELL OFF, and therefore it’s price has been dropping, this clearly isn’t adoption.
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:47:46
That’s not true, in fact it’s the opposite way round.
Yes of course BTC had a mountain to climb getting to one dollar and to where we are today, but Bitcoin did by creation have 100% of the market, if you do some research you’ll realise that other alts have chipped away at that market share, and that drop in market share is still growing.
I don’t like to speculate but BTC has lost 35% of that market cap now, there is no reason it won’t go lower, this then  makes it harder for its market cap to grow, and the price of a bitcoin.
There are also many other legitimate reason why BTC won’t get anywhere near 100k, one main one at present is only 5.8million people own bitcoin in varying amounts.
I could go on, about boom and bust nascent industries that the public watch from the sidelines fed by bad news from mainstream media, the physiological effects are indeed more powerful than “FOMO”, facts are these busts scare away mainstream investors, leaving a stagnant market and price, BTC has seen 8 busts and one large one, it’s these large ones the public notice because these are the ones who make the early investors most money, and the late comers lose most.
Those loses are what cripple it’s future.
And the guy below also knows and speaks the truth, his points are vary valid.

Before you keep touting rubbish around on reddit and to your friends or the general public making yourself look silly, with remarks how the USA can or will go Bankrupt, or any of your rubbish about how the US dollar has lost purchasing power ect ect..., you should read.
And this is one reason BTC will fail because the people in its space think they know about economics, secondly a glaringly obvious flaw is the “US DOLLAR”, does not base its model on countries economies imploding, like bitcoin does, in fact the dollar thrives *with them or without them*, but clearly always better *with them* in the green *WHEN THE FOG CLEARS* you will understand, bitcoins dilemma.

Bitcoin allows transactions without oversight maybe, but if they do look, they can find the person behind the transaction, through its digital trail, especially if you have ever cashed out or shared your real identification.
So sorry cash money, is way more private.

No I’m saying for the third time, better products can come along, and wipe out the competition, sometimes it takes time some times it happens quick, simply put the masses only need to turn to another coins that does things better than BTC and it will die slowly along with its price.
Just like Volkswagen, Audi, and BMW smashed ford into the ground, and that’s without all the other car makes that entered the market, ford failed to keep it top place.

29,25% of gold used in bars and gold coin creation, central bank purchases equals 4.98%.
That leaves a total of 65.07% of the total gold supply that used in various other industry, now read what you wrote.
Secondly gold ��, is not the oldest form of money CATTLE of various forms are.
Also ��, gold gets value because it’s annual production is low (scarce).
But as we move on to reserve currency or as we *CRYPTO CURRENCY ENTHUSIASTS* like to call them fiat currencies, *THAT IS THE MOST CRINGE WORTHY �� STATEMENT* I’ve ever heard, I feel your embarrassment, “what an utter twat”.
Firstly do bitcoin miners implement 51% attacks on the system that feeds them *NO they don’t*, even though they may not like another mining pool.
It’s the same thing with dollars dumb ass, you can’t come off the dollar because you’ll economically commit suicide, you clearly don’t understand dollars and reserve currency.
������, BITCOIN HAS EVERYTHING TO GAIN, the US dollar has everything to lose, thats really funny considering it’s true, but only true because bitcoin does nothing and only has value because it’s linked to the dollar, this is how ironic bitcoin is can’t you see it yet,* WHEN THE FOG CLEARS*.
Maybe someone clearly as dumb as you hasn’t worked out yet people talk of bitcoins in dollar value, geez.
Listen very carefully to what I’m telling you in front of the reddit crowd, I’m embarrassing you now, I’m pulling apart your limited knowledge on every aspect of what you say, and what you think is right, your knowledge on every subject you’ve posted about is best learnt off YouTube or ill informed web pages, you’re clearly immature in real world subjects political and financial.

Oh I was convinced BTC was the first coin to cure the double spend, that’s why I was mining it in early 2011, seems I missed the boat if like you say BTC wasn’t the first.
BTC hasn’t been gaining market cap it’s been losing from day one, also every time a coin is launched it will inevitably lose more, irrespective of what the next coin can do, this is called market economics.
Only due to newbies, why don’t you check out grin and beam, lots of cryptographer cypher punks see both as advancement on BTC because of the privacy they bring compared, and that’s before David chaums team release elixir, so here are three coins and protocols that as I said bring something and take market cap away.
And no as I said Bitcoin was the first, only after where there many, you’ve got it the wrong way round, open source leads to more, after BTC not before.
Yet again only 5.8 million people own BTC, tiny and far from it not showing signs of spread showing signs of sell.
Real people buying BTC pushes prices higher if they outstrip supply, the price shows there is an over supply, so NO it’s not spreading as you’d have people believe.
BEST money ever, you clearly don’t understand money or have any financial background, as you don’t pay tax on money, on bitcoin you do, it’s an asset, get the facts straight please.
Accumulation of large quantities of bitcoin give you a control over the price, not the Blockchain, but as I said the money market, as I was talking about whales.
I don’t care about the Bitcoin cash or that market I was talking about BTC, and referencing BTC.
Durrrr, money of the poor, WTF, 10 to 15% of the worlds population hold most of the wealth, what aren’t you sure about, and bitcoin wallets tell the same story, do not lie.
Bitcoin is classed as SOUND MONEY by you, not by the regulators, so can we cut the crap please, until they class it as money or currency, which it isn’t very good at imitating, then you’ll still pay tax on it OK.
Oh money has to do with supply ��, your going to be pretty fucked then when you need a extra in your economy to create more growth in times of need, and geez volatility is fine I suppose, if it’s worth £1000 today and £500 tomorrow  , yes I can see it’s sound money, don’t make me laugh with this horse shit.
As I said BTC is the most unregulated, volatile, and manipulated market on earth, there is no difference between it and governments and central banks manipulating the money supply, do you realise how weak your argument is, and how stupid you look by not admitting it ��.
The whales I talk of where not previously wealthy, ummmm Peter tiel, ect ect, blah blah, NO of course they weren’t, but even if they weren’t they can crash this market today, wipe out people’s wealth, buy up again cheap, and repeat, you should start to learn a bit more.
You’ll also find unless these people who own these wallets were early miners, they were clearly wealthy before, as I said your maths is diabolical because if it wasn’t you’d realise, ��‍♂️��, you need stacks of money to buy such large amounts, be gone with your weak response.

In 2013 i gave 1000 BTC away, also I sold 1500 BTC from 2011 all the way up to 2017, at varying prices.
That leave me with 1500 BTC as of today, so I don’t lose, and I can’t lose.

Not in the uk, there are no surcharges, they were banned 12 months ago, if you pay by debit or credit card it’s as good as paying with cash.
If you live in the US your probably right, most people in the US are screwed anyway.
As I said what ever the cash price is, that’s all I can be charged for paying with plastic, and if I clear my credit card bill each month I incurred no interest either, my debit card is cash in plastic form as the money is debited from my account at point of sale.
Cheaper than using bitcoins, for two reasons, firstly you buy Bitcoins with cash you’ve already paid tax on, then your taxes again on any increase in the BTC price at point of sale, plus the Blockchain miner fee, so no bitcoin isn’t cheaper no way.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:42:53
Nope they prefer other currencies,  dollars, Swiss franc, German marks and sterling, poor people seek low volatility currency for obvious reasons (they’ve often already lost enough, without gambling further) that’s why most of what you read about bitcoin is lies, in fact Libertarian wishwash, and this shows why it’s so low in Venezuela, hope this makes sense for you.

Can’t really be bothered tonight to discuss the other aspects above as I’m busy.
But supply and demand clearly show its number base has dropped, because the price equals sell off, that is your evidence, the price of a bitcoin is lower than its highs.
Also why are you spending bitcoin, that shows little knowledge of currency or money, why are you spending something that’s presumed to be worth more than fiat, you always spend the least valued on the service, you were doing well till you let that slip.
But your thought pattern is completely wrong, you think because you can use bitcoin that, that is adoption wrong wrong wrong, shops of places that accept BTC isn’t adoption, it is a means for adoption to happen, REAL adoption is people buying bitcoin and putting a strain on the supply.
We can see adoption has fallen by a lower price, if demand outstrips supply by adoption the the price will rise, when its rising constantly you’ll know there is constant demand.
Sorry but it’s not happening and using it is very odd.

Hence it’s being regulated and moulded to what the authorities will allow, “BUT NO”, it doesn’t bend, “of course it does “,it’s begging for acceptance, and half the fools on here are desperate for the regulatory acceptance, because their desperate for price rises, it truly is a circus.
Oh and I see because someone can send a payment they are not meant to, you think that’s makes BTC a world beater, ummmm, I would call that a niche aspect, barely a tool for mass adoption, people were doing it with suitcases full of cash before BTC, or through shadow companies, really ��.

Satoshi didn’t want the lightening network at all, the lightening network is a last chance saloon add on for a failed scaling solution that was proposed by satoshi.
The lightening network is BOLLOCKS, simply put people who spend BTC are fools, spending BTC doesn’t increase its value, hodling I get and stand by, spending it is for people who clearly don’t understand money.
Even satoshi got this completely wrong, a service has to be worth more than the unit of exchange, why would you use BTC, if you can use fiat, it makes no sense and does nothing for its price rise or acceptance.
As a store of value it makes more sense, just as holdling makes more sense, at least holding stops institutions amassing BTC, which in turn limits supply, meaning if demand grows so will the price, but buying things with BTC is lunacy.
Crypto isn’t a good currency at all, but it is a good store of value, we could argue it’s volatility doesn’t do it many favours in this department, and no doubt by definition it’s not a good store of value.
But I think, store of value above currency, if the regulators change the rules which I think eventually they’ll have to because they’re going to struggle tracing everyone for the taxes owed on purchases then as a currency classification, with no tax to pay on purchases bitcoins may become an all round champion.
But for now it’s not, and let’s not get deluded about this.
Not let’s not get deluded about the tiny amount of people globally that own Bitcoin, at present, the mountain it has to climb is massive.

No not at all, I got my BTC free, why would I be salty, my company turnover  per annum without bitcoin is 6 million uk.
If I was going to be salty I would be salty about the 1000 BTC I gave away.
Not the 1000 is sold for £12000, I take it your math isn’t so good, because 0 to £12000 is a 12000% profit which equals 12 million if multiplied by 1000BTC.
Then there is the 1000 BTC I sold all the way up from 2011, for varying prices, which were extremely low at some points.
Leaving me with 2000BTC 
Why would I be salty, young fella?.
I’m a realist and I say it like it is.
Oh and keep on talking about how long you’ve had an account for, it won’t do you any favours financially, how long have you or when did you join the cryptographers mailing list?.

If they could inflate the supply to those level clearly anyone would see, I grant you they can manipulate it to a degree.
Let’s say I lined up 200million people who all wanted BTC, what’s the exchange going to do?, and moreover what’s the price going to do.
Meaning you can only inflate the supply so far, before you’re caught out.
But you make a good point in the fact that BTCs supply can be fractionally reserve influenced, very similar to CME and these cash settled futures contracts, clearly not a good selling point for something touted as immune to banking practices��.
Over 80% of the total supply has already been mined, without taking into consideration hacks and lost private keys,
Only 5.8 million people own  BTC, 87% of the mined supply to date are sat in only 7% of walllets, the remaining supply is spread around other owners, and they say the average holding of most individuals is 1BTC or below.
Now factor in only 1800 BTC are mined daily you realise that putting a strain on supply shouldn’t be difficult at all, this is why nakamoto created it this way, blaming exchanges isn’t the answer in “whole”.
“NO”, the true reason is people are just not buying it, anyone who can do basic maths should clearly see its adoption rates are miserable, not only miserable but lied about constantly.

I really can’t be that bothered convincing you, your so misinformed I find it very odd.
And others in industry and this space say the same its days are numbered, 2nd generations are always better.
I stand by the facts of the major retailers, Amazon, eBay, alibaba, Walmart and the list goes on, aren’t using bitcoins there is a clear reason, I would say these giants of commerce know how much exactly they’d save if they used bitcoin, clearly they’re saying what I’m saying.
Also immutability is a ridiculous aspect of a currency anyone who backs this is deluded, because it only protects the seller, and not the consumer, if you knew anything about retail or business you’d realise your clients are who make your business, taking away their option of cancelling an order, or giving them no leeway in a dispute, with cause them to leave and shop elsewhere.
In a dispute the shop that’s meant to be saving money would now have to sent another transaction through bitcoin to the customer as a refund, MORE charges and who picks those up the customer I presume.
It really is nowhere in society.
Prices go up also by fixed rate inflation rates, they go up regardless of bitcoins.
I do live in the real world because I know or have not seen anywhere, without trawling round for some novelty small institution that does accept it, in fact lots of institutions stopped accepting it because of lack of interest.
Good luck making a holder mentality asset a working real world payment rail the compete with Goliaths of finance.

Convincing ones self the wars won, when there are armies all around you is for fools, I can’t see why the authors a fool, I see a pool of people who only seem to want to discredit the author, and hand each other artificial back slapping of one another.
Yet again debate fails, because everyone agree and anyone who dare say other wise will be abused, called a troll, or downvoted.

It’s relying on them to spur price increases, and the rest of the bitcoin community hopes it does, as nobody pays attention to a low price, it makes adoption slow.
85% of the population don’t care what it does they only care about easy profit, and therefore it’s price.
But ironically letting those investors in  who play on that side of the fence, kind of makes BTC less desirable to the hardened decentralised proponents, and rightly so.
As their greed is no different that the banks, they all eat from the same trough.
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:21:23
It’s only perfect for that if the money moved is genuine, and not dirty, plus most countries don’t let you bring in more than a certain amount, those people who do get caught and will eventually get caught transferring large amount without authorisation will be serving big prison sentences in the future, of course they won’t get caught because the Blockchain is so not private��.
But yes if it’s for purposes to remove swift, inter banking fine, yet not fine because those institutions don’t use it.
I’m not convinced it will improve, the TX speeds are ridiculous and it’s TX per second are the worst of the worst, they all say wait for LN, but when you look at LN it’s a centralised system, that’s not even guaranteed to function properly, and a obvious reason is, who’s going to spend bitcoin, when they may shoot up in value?.
And even if some people do, the percentage will be to small to impact a retail market, it won’t be worth merchants implementing the machines, volumes of sales will be so low.
Bitcoin is full of flaw after flaw.
In my option LTC is better than BTC, for payments.
But wait 2 generation crypto’s that have and are being built from the ground up, that are completely private, can scale from scratch ect, may well unseat bitcoin, it’s already lost 40% give or take of its market share to other alts, so why not a master alt, that was satoshi’s vision originally.
Because I bet nakamoto would do things different next time, I bet now he sees how they’ve regulated it and manipulated it, I bet he’d have a different approach, especially to privacy.

Well they are all true facts, usually true decentralisation means authority can’t touch it, they may not be able to turn it off, but masses of regulation and a truly opaque Blockchain means they can centralise it in many ways, examples are why would you registers all your personal details to be able to interact on it and with it, KYC, AML, that’s forced regulation from a centralised authority, yet bitcoin is decentralised YEAH RIGHT, if you’d have said partly decentralised then I’d agree.

Even with all of the actively in this space they don’t see that this offers any productive value, simply put no one know that value of a Bitcoin in real terms, but what’s sure is it cannot function neither as currency or money or a store of value in real world term.

No the CTFC will either give them permission to grant physically backed BTC futures contracts or it won’t, BAKKT have said recently in a report that they are waiting CTFC approval, “I STATE AWAITING”, if this approval is not given there will be no physically backed contracts, what BAKKT will do is accept the CDFCs decision just like all other comers who have been turned down, then they will revert back and pay out those contracts in dollars.
For your limited knowledge of financial products I will explain the reasons for you,
1) firstly by settling contracts in “fiat dollar”, you increase demand for dollars, NOT BTC.
2) Regulatory bodies like SEC, and CFTC are not going to let a direct challenge to the dollar happen, nor are they going to let the BTC price skyrocket in this way.
3) firstly consumers who buy into a scenario like that, as they did in 2017/2018, will likely lose when the speculation starts.
Believe what you like, all BTC contracts will always be cash settled, and you can tell by the delays that BAKKT are struggling proving to the CTFC, that their house is in order.
I’ve been right every time to date, and I am now also.

Dreams of utopian worlds are and have been just dreams and will be into the future, even if Bitcoin could become a global currency (which it can’t for many reasons), it wouldn’t stop greed ect..,
We already have a state in BTC with 87% or known supply in only 7% of holders wallets, this isn’t any different than the rich in a fiat system owning most of the fiat, which they do.
And as for BTC transactions, even with “LN”, it can’t scale to the degree needed for all global transactions.

Your economics is at least poor, if you’re talking about poorer countries who knows, but the USA can’t go Bankrupt as the USA has the dollar which if you knew anything, you’d know it’s a nation state currency.
In basic terms unless the USA declares themselves bankrupt, which why would you, then they can’t go bust.
Plus because the dollar is the worlds reserve currency, sending the USA into financial crisis by calling in debt wouldn’t be a smart move.
Also if you did your homework you’d realise the USA may have depts but it’s owed huge amounts also.
Silly boys on reddit or YouTube who declare the end is nigh just make fools of themselves in the grown up world.
Two little tricks you should read up on.
What ever the USA creates in dept, it can also cancel out.
And because the whole world works on dollars, they always have and will have demand.
And all the rest of what you’ve said is hear say, wishful thinking, or pure crap.
Even countries like Venezuela chase dollars, Swiss francs, German mark and of course sterling, you’ll find If again you do more homework these currencies are always in far higher demand than bitcoins, and the reason is they are less volatile, so they keep value (not if but or maybe, they do), which for people with more to lose they’re a safer bet.

Bitcoins security level in the early days was zero, over time through financial incentive it has gained more miners, thus making its platform more and more secure.
Fact one, BTC network early days could have easily been controlled and double spends implemented, the reason it wasn’t is no value incentive to do so, plus only a hand full of people knew about it.
If  you believe a BTC price that’s not economical will keep the miners hash power in place and hence the security element fine, I don’t because miners and individuals will and would move on to the next alternative, each time making it easier and easier for a 51% attack to be implemented, even if the miners could be bothered in this scenario to reverse blocks or try and prevent an attack like this, all faith would be gone, in a system that was meant to be unbreakable.
Facts are computing power is needed and the more you take away the less secure your network is, and economically people don’t work for free.
And like I said before it’s proven in economics that just because LN can or will scale, doesn’t mean it will ever get that traffic, simply put people in general won’t spent BTC or any other deflationary currency, if you work out the percentage that will, it’s even smaller than the amount of people who own bitcoins, and that is a tiny amount also, so thinking this will become a global payment rail is fools folly.
Bitcoin stands as safe fairer ethical system ��, not really, it has security while it has more hash power than an attacker can muster I grant you that, but if you think living in a deflationary economy is better than living under a corrupt government then you’re  wrong, because a deflationary economy is just as much of a disaster if not more so.
The world is working fine, yes there are a few lower scale economies in trouble this isn’t anything new, it’s not the currency, it’s the way the countries have been run, and corruption is always key to their failures, Bitcoin wouldn’t cure this period.
And I cannot understand why anyone thinks a Ledger that records your life financial payments is so wonderful, once I’ve linked your public key with your identity I know everything about your payment history��, and immutability is silly in a real world payment system because it only protects the seller, it gives the purchaser less insurance than tradition payment methods, let’s hope you never have a dispute.
You should read about deflation, this guide is pretty basic but stands the test.

Listen you always here success stories, I had 5000 BTC I’ve made a lot of money off BTC, but I know there are guys out there who’ve lost thousands, the point is you’ll only hear the good not the bad ok.
Deflationary currency isn’t good for an economy, simply put not enough people will spend it percentage wise, they’ll spend the fiat because it in their minds has less value.
As an example if a bitcoin will be worth one million, logically you’ll store it away and wait, like a squirrel with its nuts ��, which is fine as you put strain on supply (hence hodl), the problem
come when you try and run your economic model of this mentality.
This is what happens, every time.
Like here are your words, YOUR FIAT WOULD BE DOWN 20%, well no it wouldn’t if you invest, in maybe a home or stock or shares, as these things gain value which offsets that depreciation, these people want you to think it’s so clean cut, when simply it isn’t.
And charges also are a myth, you can operate in the modern system relatively fee free if you’re smart, you see bitcoins on chain capacity for TX is so slow and small, you only need a big bull run and its fees are huge compared to other mainstream products, it’s a myth bitcoin is cheap, it is only cheap because not many people use it, if they did the fees would skyrocket again.

Yes and most bitcoin proponents don’t even know how tiny the holder base of bitcoin is, and if you point it out to them they call you troll.          
And it’s simple enough to work out in someways, the price being the main one, as a low price signals a low demand on supply, and this never lies even though most on here will try yet again and tell you otherwise.
Also BTC may be set algorithmically at 21 million, but exchanges inflate the supply and also some financial products have and do inflate the supply, basically all done via false accounting, so much for limited supply set in stone, as it’s no different to fractional reserve systems that are in place today (although they can only inflate to a certain degree I admit, but inflate still the same).
Believe me Bitcoin has has long enough now to either me grasped up on or not, and 5.8 million is the latter.
The public are not interested, simply they have easier alternatives they will always choose ease and they will always choose centralisation because that’s how the world always worked for them.
For crypto to work institutions like banks and government would have to embrace it, and they really don’t need it, they can carry on as they are regardless of doom monger stories.

Well the whole point is that the governments around the world won’t let demand for bitcoins get out of control.
Why do you think all these futures contracts are cash settled, simply because if they are bitcoin settled they physically have to buy Bitcoins, meaning demand and higher prices.
Sooner or later Bitcoin becomes a direct threat, that won’t happen ever.
The answer to your question is yes on that side (payments), they will want tax, and tax on any profits or capital gains, which defeats the object of money for most people.

But I wouldn’t argue it with you, you’ll bore me.

The point is no ones bothered about stopping it, people in a niche marker are interested in it, but the rest of the worlds population don’t care, everyone around you are spending fiat, that should make you aware that BTC isn’t as popular as you think, nor is it needed.

They aren’t printing money, neither has their inflation situation come from printing money, plus they don’t have the option to print money, plus the printing of money is a very expensive exercise, in fact most countries do not have the capacity to print their own currency, it is in fact printed for them, *out sourced to companies that print it all for them, unlike the United stated and the UK, and a few others.
All this Bullshit from history like the Weimar Republic are no pertinent in today’s world of finance.
In fact Venezuela doesn’t even have enough bolivares to go around, so some towns have issues their own paper notes, if they had been printing money there would be an abundance, yet there isn’t.

I think your post is misleading you’re making out the BTC stored on exchanges is the reason why supply and demand isn’t kicking in.
RUBBISH, and the reason why is actually most BTC isn’t kept on exchange.
At the moment demand for bitcoins is lower than supply”simple”
You only have 1800 BTC per day being mined, if you constantly sell the daily mined supply you put strain on the supply chain, that means the price rises, regardless of exchanges, also as long as all the other BTC in existence are already owned.
I’m not condoning storing BTC on an exchange, but if you are in the belief that this is the major factor you’re clearly misguided.
If today 21 million people bought 1 Bitcoin, the price would jump sky high, nothing to do with exchanges per se, as long as demand outstrips supply you’ll have increased, and the more you have buying over known supply, the bigger the rises or increases.
On the other hand falling prices are an over supply due in turn to people selling off assets and increasing market supply, this is the state of the market today.
As is equilibrium a state in which known supply and daily mined volume is bought at the same rate, this gives a steady stable price, with very little volatility.
There are a few other factors of course such as manipulation and dirty tactics, but over all you can’t deny supply and demand either up or down on the spot price.
Simply the more people buy the higher the price goes.
This is nakamotos model FOMO, simple, yet it’s not really working, or certainly not very quickly.
Also unless you have some proof that the 87% of all existing Bitcoin that Resides in only 7% of wallets (whales), is stored on exchanges “which I do not think it is”, then clearly there isn’t more BTC stored on exchanges that in private wallets, oh and I’m not talking about exchanges own wallets, I am talking of investors not linked to the exchanges?.
Please read
Please read
Plus if you factor in loses and hacks the known supply is also way less, than people realise, yet still no pressure on supply.
Simply put blaming exchanges is ill thought out and doesn’t explain supply and demand metrics in anyway worthy of praise.
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:07:07
No you’re wrong, well partly, hodling does indeed limit supply, but you’re wrong that it increases demand, demand isn’t connected at all.
Demand is separate it’s either there or it isn’t, and the market decides whether demand is there, you can have all the BTC locked up, but no demand “means no demand”.
Hodling is  not a magic bullet like you’re making out it is.
So many people on reddit are mis informed how supply and demand work, you’re not the first.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:52:16

Plus Lordy how are you working out this huge price for a satoshi?
Based on what?
Your words You’ve got 1BTC in the world, all others are hoarded.
Your 1 BTC funds the LN network.
I said what for, if no one uses any of the others, what good is a payment network that no one uses, it hypothetical based on your jibberish, but how does it work, with no one using it, remember all the other coins are hoarded.
And if they aren’t used how are you getting to this staggering amount for one satoshi, based on?????

And as I said try and tell me how you have a low price and all the adoption your charts talk about, if you can’t answer just forget it.

Oh of course I’m wrong why would I be right I mean I have a degree in economics, and I understand supply and demand.
Of course when you have such a low price, it signals people are buying out the known supply.
Or does it mean they’re not?, I don’t care about the link you’ve posted, truly if you understood supply and demand you’d clearly realise when prices drop they drop because demand has wained and there are more of that product than buyers for it, market metrics like this don’t lie, it’s like seeing an alt coin worth pennies and saying it’s in high demand, Yeah right buddy.
But if you think you know better try telling me in your own words, as you cannot have this low price high demand scenario in the real world.
When people buy BTC they strip down supply, if they hold it in wallets, long term they limit it more, considering 87% of all BTC are already held in only 5% of wallets, leaving the the rest that are available in the other wallet, may I add most other wallets have 1BTC or less in them, you’ll already see there aren’t many to go around, by now you should be suspicious, SO let’s continue because 1800 BTC are mined each day and we have over 8 billion people world wide, and also a future where the block reward will yet again be halved, there truly isn’t many BTC around.
So anyone who can do basic maths would think geez if demand is strong and people are buying BTC on a large scale, logically the price must move up, IS IT? “NO”.
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:40:21
We will wait for their release, then you can look all you like.
Bitcoins had nearly 50% of its market share taken away from it, by other coins, they don’t have to always be better, but they still can take market share.
There are 120 million people in Mexico City, maybe you’ll get the TINY part through your head from this and also adoption has been dropping.
So no not a matter of perspective, a matter of maths, plain and simple.
Oh and please let’s not keep comparing it with other success stories, FFS even nakamoto didn’t need another 10 years, his perspective was 10, either everywhere or no where, and it’s no where compared to everywhere.
Remember 5.8 million people, or didn’t you read the link.

Not a case of whether it was dirty money I said, it’s illegal to transfer over a certain amount over a border for clear reasons.
Even if the money is clean your breaking the law of that country and you could incur  imprisonment if caught and many will be in the end.
Whether there are ways to make bitcoin more private, other coins will and do do that from scratch, no point making BTC private now is it when all of you have already pumped over your private information, only for those who come after the privacy updates will benefit, other crypto’s will be void of all that rubbish from day one, PRIVATE bitcoin isn’t.
A completely private coin would meet resistance, really how are you going to stop it?.
People say you can’t stop bitcoin and it’s decentralise open, not private system. So how are you going to stop a truly decentralised, completely private coin?, simply you can’t.
So logically I can guarantee you any 2nd generation crypto that’s completely decentralised and has purely private function, will no doubt be a better alternative for merchant businesses, even used for tax avoidance and dark web purposes, it’s value would outstrip BTCs relatively quickly as people swap over.
Bearing in mind that most dark web activity doesn’t include BTC so much now because of its lack of privacy, those privacy coins are used more,  but they are still not as private as 2nd generation.

Ask warren buffet if you thing business always goes your way, it doesn’t and crypto currency is on its arse, without going into those details now, all I will say is they’ll be lucky if they get that volume of interest anyway, times moved on since it was last proposed when times and prices were better.
But i will answer the question for you that you neglected to reply on, firstly if you have masses of people buying bitcoins you’ll start a huge bull run, every money making greedy arsehole on earth and the naive will jump in, that will put a strain on demand pushing the BTC price ever skyward, so much so everyone will be in through FOMO, and the dollar will become threaten and banks will lose deposits.
As I said there is no way they will take the chance of authorising something that isn’t paid in dollar denominations.
And also when the prices are rising hacks increase, everything follows suit, they will be hacked “NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS”.
Let me also add, when they get refused and people find out those contracts will only be cashed settled, more people will sell off crypto holding causing further losses and price drops.
So many in this space a desperate for something and without the likes of BAKKT there really is nothing, just a lot of hot air and shallow promises.
The end may well be nigh.

As your now learning this is what inflation does no matter how much money you create you’ll still end up with not enough as prices rise, in other words a shortage of an abundance is exactly how it works, countries do not just keep printing money, it’s a myth because they know eventually it has no purpose.

Come on.
It’s not a currency or money, it’s an asset trying to badly imitate money in its purest form, no ones interested about paying with it because it deflationary, and clearly only a fool would use it for payments if they had any financial understanding.
Secondly the public will not be interested with the hassle compared to traditional payments, only 5.8 million holders of crypto currency in 10 years is a strong statement, and with only 7% of people owning 85% of all bitcoins in existence locked in whale wallets, it’s spread becomes even less meaningful.
It’s biggest flaw is that’s its transactions aren’t completely private, if they were no government would have been able to tax it or control who owned it.

A market that only has 5.8 million people who own Bitcoin, I’m afraid is classed as niche.
For that reason it’s not changing the world, it’s just in a small compartment.
Even if you give people an exit, I’ve just shown you they often don’t take it because they’re lazy.
There is no such thing as a free market or a free ride, everyone has taxes to pay.
Peer to peer works both ways, if I use fiat to pay, its peer to peer, peer to peer payments existed before bitcoin, peer to peer just means from you to me.
No censorship is a myth, because bitcoin is regulated where it matters, KYC, AML, and financial regulation, that is barely censorship resistant.
And because of the above these clearly are the rules.
If you think Bitcoin cures debt your wrong, people take on debt, debt doesn’t come looking for people, bitcoin can’t cure debt.
And I don’t think the people want saving from banks, libertarians may well do, cypherpunks, but normal people on the street I don’t think care, if they were so worried they’d be buying bitcoin, 5.8 million people worldwide says they aren’t.
As I said in an earlier post Mexico City has a population of 130million people, and that’s one city, this should put bitcoin into perspective, especially when there are 8.5 billion people on earth.
Free speech it may be for that niche market, but the rest don’t seem to care about free speech.

The irony is so over the top, I don’t think I can be bothered carrying on this conversation, If you were my account I’d sack you, because how the hell are you saving your business clients money when you are condoning using something that they’ll  incur more tax on, than the alternative.
Also if you’re trying to give me lessons in financial products or economics I wouldn’t bother, I assure you I am far more qualified than a number cruncher, (all respect due).
Firstly anyone who uses bitcoin as a payment means has no understanding of monetary value, it’s a stupid move spending it, no one with any financial knowledge would, because it’s value is more than fiat, any savvy individual would spend the fiat for the service.
Oh and I don’t let people tell me, you are deluded if you think the worlds financial ecosystem doesn’t work or revolve around rules and regulation, you can bang on as much as you like about decentralised currency, but the regulators are still firmly in control, that’s why all mainstream financial institutions have to pass strict measures before those licences are granted.
BITCOIN IS NO DIFFERENT, and also for it to work it has to bend, they don’t, they are in control.
Try telling your clients taxes don’t matter this tax year, tell them go spend the money on you, I bet you’ll be in prison next year for advising them taxes don’t matter and don’t listen to them, what so they know. ��
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:25:45
I don’t care what it has, my point was, anyone who understand money function, would never use a currency that will increase in value, when they can use the alternative that is cheaper.
Plus you also have tax to pay on a gain, so it all works out dearer, facts are there are enough wallets now for the whole world population, they are tried and tested and secure, the point is it’s not how many wallets you have, it’s more about how many are interested in using them and they aren’t using the ones that are available now.
There are only 5.8 million people own BTC worldwide, so hey ho the figures are clear, no one is buying in, more wallets doesn’t increase adoption, it just means more wallets.
The internet is littered with them, yet here we are only a few million use them.

The network effect is only supported by miner hash power, and that shrinks with the price, arguably if the price goes really low, BTC network effect for another 2nd gen coin wouldn’t be so much of a problem to overcome, albeit all scenarios rely on customers buying in, that’s why I said a 2nd gen with improvement could easily unseat BTC.
I’m not one for what bitcoin can’t do now, I don’t care unless those add ins are proven and as yet they’re not.
Even the LN network doesn’t excite me, it still has issues for scaling on a mass adoption level, and security isn’t what it is on chain, no matter what anyone says.
But Litecoin can implement LN, and all other things BTC can, they both run on the same open source code, Litecoin could even take BTC place if more people bought in, simply it’s about demand from people, miners will mine the most profit, they don’t care which coin or where.
Not really second gen coins, can scale way higher than BTC from scratch, they really are picking apart all the defects and implementing these things from scratch.
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:14:14
There won’t be that many on chain transactions, as if there was the fees would sky rocket yet again and BTC would become not viable for on chain transactions, so no on chain transactions wouldn’t save the miners, as no ones going to pay high fees.
That is the whole idea of this second layer “LN”, it’s problem is, it’s only useful for smaller TX values, amongst other things, and yes this guys correct, if those” LN”, fees become virtually free, it basically means without mass adoption which is a massive hurdle, the LN network won’t be viable.
All the above taken into consideration LN is years away from being a trustworthy working platform, and any crypto that comes along that can scale on chain from scratch has the potential to destroy or make LN invalid, or resign it to the history books as another failed project, and it better hurry its game up if it doesn’t want to meet this fate.
And also don’t forget bitcoins promises, from day one, lower fees than traditional payments, well it can’t get lower than cash, and it’s struggling to keep up with debit cards, and credit cards, in the fee battle.
And that’s completely wrong that it doesn’t matter how many miners exit, whether or not the mining difficulty adjusts is irrelevant at this stage in bitcoins history, because if you strip away hash power you strip away security, the block rewards are still achievable sure, but the security is weaker.
Let’s say you have 100 miners and they give 100% security through their combined hash power.
Then we have 90 miners leave and their hash power goes, you end up with a weaker network, your hash rate has dropped 90%.
Meaning any one worldwide who can attack the network with more hash power will be able to double spend, take into consideration this only needs to happen once and your system and correlating price collapses.
People making out that the BTC price can go as low as it likes, and miners will mine for free is ridiculous, and because the miners are the security with the hash power they muster combined, saying it doesn’t matter how many leave because a proof of work algorithm system will adjust and still have the necessary security to fend of higher hash rate attacks is rubbish, it’s a complete lie.
Price and profit= miner interest.
High hash power= security.
Low price Low profit= bankruptcy at some point.
Low price Low profit= Lowering hash power and lowering security.
Same as Price high= adopter interest (FOMO)
Low Price = sell off, lowering adoption.
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:58:10
1) think mass adoption would be ridiculously hard without third parties, plus even if you discount exchanges, you can’t disregard regulators, they say what BTC can and is allowed to do in their system, and without their system, Bitcoin becomes no more than a black marked product.
6) I don’t care how much of a network you own with your scenario, the bottom line is price, he said it can only appreciate, I said no, because it’s an assumption based on how many buy in, if no one buy in, it will collapse.
7) LN , is pointless unless people use crypto on a grand scale, that is an If, and a but, and a maybe, personally I can’t see the incentive over visa or debit, I don’t care about a fee, because centralisation gives me security in that payment network, LN does not.
Pretty much everything in BTC relies on more people, there is no way major merchants will use a system if lots of people aren’t interacting with the currency, they may as well stay with what they have, and I don’t see crypto moving in that high demand direction, i see a niche market.

And truly I cannot be bothered replying to the rest as it’s all IFS, BUTS, AND MAYBES, based on no facts.
They only thing I will point out that is so prosperous is your comment Bitcoin is not even trying to gain adoption LOL, BTC has been trying to do this from day one, because if no one else buys in its values don’t increase haha.
Oh the devs decide on when adoptions right, and who adopts ��, NO they don’t, all they do is create software, it’s people buying BTC that makes adoption grow, you’re confused, it’s not soft ware updates, or more wallets, or any other Mumbo jumbo in bitcoin world that makes bitcoin become more adopted, they are just tools, NO, it’s real people buying real bitcoins, and they’re simply not.
Let me add for you, coinbase is SO linked to BTC there is no denying that, when the IRS have finished auditing each account and public key address, then sent out their tax demands on profits from BTC, and taxes for purchases, you then come back and tell me that Bitcoin is completely decentralised.
Because in the decentralised  kingdom that I envisage, they wouldn’t be able to find me nor make me pay tax on my profits, yet alone trace me to my front door ��.

*if, but maybe blah blah* as I said the USA can’t go bankrupt look it up for yourself.
Whether the US borrows more or not, is irrelevant they can borrow as much as they like, they can even create money to pay their debts then cancel the money out, just through simple accounting procedures, the  key is keeping a lid on inflation, so no you’re  talking crap.
By your understanding of how things work countries like Japan with such a high debt to GDP figure would have been finished years ago, but hey ho they are not, funny that isn’t it ��.
Bitcoins doing well, ummm 5.8 million people is doing well out of 8 billion yeah if that’s what you class a success ��, with a weak price and more selling than buying, “what bitcoin are you talking about LOL”.
And no the USA doesn’t pay interest on the dollars it creates you fool, would you like a link showing how stupidly wrong you are, the whole point of being in charge of your currency is to be able to create dollars and pay off debt without incurring interest.
Do you want the evidence?????!
Then you can crawl away?.
In fact you need this more than me, do some study before you come in half educated.
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:59:19
Yes your right, this is just more BS, to make Bitcoin look like its better than it is, let’s face facts, this volume of money isn’t shops and online shops, payments from and to in BTC, it’s just money moving from wallet to wallet.
PayPal on the other hand or visa, well their transaction aren’t speculation, they are clearly only payment services, used in the real world in real time with real value.
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:04:15
Ummmm yes it was period.
You are moving goalposts from what you said originally, NO ITS NOT, yet clearly he did cure the double spend as the article and the white paper tell you.
Also for your education, Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t invent Merkle trees, and Blockchains are built on these older Merkle tree concepts, Link provided please read.
Also I will provide a link to Ralph Merkle, who clearly did invent the Merkle tree, please read this also.
Nope bitcoins market cap is down here is just one example.
But if you’d like to check on coin market cap go ahead, ON APRIL 28th 2013 BITCOIN HAD 94.29% OF THE MARKET, (this is the first date from which they provide data), AND OF TODAY THAT MARKET SHARE HAS DROPPED TO 52.29%, so telling me that other crypto coins don’t reduce its market share is rubbish, go and check the figures ��‍♂️!.
You’re are missing the point that it’s had 100% of the market at time of creation which it did, since then it’s lost to other crypto coins, that’s what happens in business and when you have open source white papers, each new comer takes a little part of the pie, you should read some business economics books.
Prove 5.8 billion ok, here is a study carried out buy Cambridge university, happy reading.
Let’s just add in this one also, as you’ll see crypto social layer is lacking badly, yes it has software add on, and all the technical side, but it’s people that aren’t adopting it that makes it weak, this kinda bolsters the 5.8 million “scenario hey”, read away anyway, and if you in some deluded way think bitcoin can work without people you’re a fool, and there are many with this attitude.
You’ll find this is more proof than you offer to the contrary ��.
Plus also in the above article you’ll also see that contrary to popular belief bitcoin and other crypto token and Blockchain are indeed influenced by other, those others being the ones who decide upon what software is added and how the change the protocol over time, it’s not a fixed software protocol, so it can be changed even manipulated for their own good, irrespective of what you or I want.
And here is another glaringly obvious problem Bitcoin seems to have, if it’s so much of a success and if you don’t believe the evidence of about how many people actually own it, think about this, china’s economy has been cooling in a big way, you’ve got trumps shut down, uncertainty in Europe as Britain looks set to leave the European Union, all of these things making financial markets less secure, so why isn’t everyone piling into BTC?, I mean logically it’s touted as a safe haven, immune from market effects, yet people are still more likely to buy tradition stores of value like gold, I mean If BTC can’t make headway in such testing times, why would it in the good times?.
International worries as China's consumption and economy slows 
Oh and here is some more proof that the cypher punk, cryptography community are very interested in grin and beam, you say PROVE IT, you should know all of this by now ��.
Whether its price is 3 times higher off old figures doesn’t mean it’s higher than its peak, that means it’s adoption rate has fallen, clearly masses of owners have sold and not re entered, you’ll find this is what causes price drops and that results in over supply LOL.
I could explain supply and demand in more detail, but you should know this also, it’s basics in economics.
I wasn’t wrong at all, as I said large quantities of bitcoin give the whale holders control over the market which it does, they can then choose their times when thy want to control the price  up or down.
Wallets don’t dictate how many people own bitcoin, people can have multiple wallets.
Wallets!=addresses!=holders. BLAH means nothing but BLAH.
Forex traders may pay tax on deals, but the money they trade isn’t taxed at point of sale or exchange, why do you keep coming back with petty arguments to try a win a battle, that the regulators already say you’ve lost, that’s not a very intelligent strategy, you have to accept regulation, and accept that bitcoin isn’t good money because you have to pay tax on its gains.
And here is yet another reason Bitcoin is poor money and shows you have not a clue about monetary value, because if you did you’d automatically realise that BTC is meant to be more valuable than fiat, logically if you have one in one pocket and the other in the other, and need to pay for a service you’d choose the least valuable, which would be the fiat.
Do you not see the irony here, as I would consider it obvious, bitcoin proponents say BTC WILL BE WORTH, yet foolishly they’re willing to spend it, and make add ons like “LN” just for this purpose, sounds crazy right, that’s because it is, HODLING  I can cope with, spending is silly, all those satoshi’s that will be worth thousands more IN THE FUTURE, come on now!!!.
This is why you generally use the least costly alternative, like we use coal over nuclear, for reasons like nuclear plants cost a lot to build, they carry significant dangers when they become older, and the spent fuel and waste is costly to get rid of, what fool chooses the dearer root?, investors want returns, so it must be cost effective.
So in bitcoins case it’s more cost effective to pay with fiat, as its mass produced and has inflation.
*Haha heard this since I was young*, YOU and everyone else are more wealthy now than when you were young, and your lame response doesn’t explain, how BTC will or would cope in a situation of lender of last resort, and an expanding population, which will reach over 15 billion in the future.
plus what ever you heard when you was young was probably wrong or you were miss informed, as the United states dollar is a nation state currency, what that means in the real world, is unless the US decided they wanted to go Bankrupt they can’t, and won’t, because every other country carries US dollar debt, and also all their currencies are dollar pegged, simply the USA can go on forever creating and cancelling out debt, with the flick of a switch, Bitcoin has nothing to replace, as they the US can indefinitely carry on regardless, simply put they can always create more money to service their debts , because they control the money supply, CLEAVER TRICK “YES”.
Now you’ll say oh but what about inflation surely printing all this money will cause inflation well NO not necessarily, where’s the proof you’ll say, well look how much quantitative easing has been implemented since 2008, worldwide yet we have a steady inflation rate, do not listen to scare mongering is the lesson here, dollar demand is always high unlike bitcoins this is another reason the dollar trumps bitcoin everyday.
If you want more links on US debt and the dollars please let me know ����.
I’m afraid if you can’t answer keeping quiet is your best policy.
Well clearly the big wallet holders , were either early miners or they were people with large amounts of wealth, Geez I’m having to repeat myself, and when I end up repeating my self generally I get bored, I pointed this out to you in my previous reply.
Suck it up buttercup, happy reading, I have many more links on economic structure, and how money works in the real world if you’d like them for educational study let me know ����.
So you’re going to be busy reading the above, I suggest you read with an open mind, take in the facts and figures, that these people have tirelessly researched.
Then look at the BTC price today= put your maths cap on, and ask how can you have such a low price per BTC coin if there is so much demand, with such a limited supply, and only 1800 coins being produced daily.
Geez 1800 people per day buying one coin each, even that isn’t happening, clearly there is more supply than demand.
Demand outstrips known supply and daily mined supply= price rise due to over demand of a limited supply.
Low price= sell off which increases supply, because bitcoins are fixed supply we know that this cannot happen, because the mining supply is fixed and cannot be increased, so it must be because there are more sellers than buyers, meaning more supply than demand, I cannot make this any clearer for you.
The above is adoption in reverse= and it’s outcome is dropping or lower prices.
Equilibrium= is a state in the supply and demand chain, where all the supply and daily mined coins would be bought at the same rate they are mined.
The outcome of equilibrium is a steady value per coin.
As I said you really do need to study more, about market effects and economics.
Anyone who says BTC has real adoption is a fool, ATM machines isn’t adoption, the guy in the shop who accepts BTC isn’t adoption, software upgrades or new protocols are not adoption, as is the LN network isn’t adoption, or smart contracts ect all that I have mentioned here are different means for people to adopt, BUT ADOPTION means REAL PEOPLE buying bitcoins, and they are not, because if they were, refer back to price HIGHT supply and demand for your answer.
Lesson over, have a nice life and learning experience.

I can use a credit card or a debit card for free, what gives, uhh, BTC isn’t cheaper than them, yet it was meant to be from the start, that never worked out, and even today if it’s adoption was higher and it’s not, because it has a small block size those TX fees would spiral again.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:17:51
So explain then if it’s such a money saver why amazon have snubbed it, let’s take into consideration how much amazons turnover is, logically how much would amazon save?, do you really think if it was the saving you think it is they wouldn’t use it?
Whether or not you can sent large amounts is irrelevant unless they are legal, could you provide a list of companies using BTC for this purpose?
Or are they using other competitors?
Also inter banking like SWIFT doesn’t need speed and it’s inter banking system works fine.
I said it’s not ready also, I said it wasn’t ready from day one, it was a failure in most departments, having to have second and third layer add ons, to save its ass from certain failure, I was just pointing out 2 generation will do all from day one, superior coins, with superior algorithms.
OH NOW THE MERCHANT can eat the fees in disputes, �� how it that different to any other chargeback, so yet again if it’s $1200 dollar saving every month, why aren’t the giants of retail using it, it’s a simple question you’re not answering?.
I didn’t say that, i said there is an inflation rate set per year via central banks, and that inflation rate is for the purpose of keeping the economy moving by devaluing your money and making less of a hodler experience, money needs to move, so if the inflation rate rises so do goods and services, yet again we revert back to how poor hodler currency is for an economy.
And I think that’s very presumptuous to say that bitcoin will always rise with more adoption, when adoption clearly isn’t happening, you can’t have it both ways, yes I’d agree if your price is risking via people buying BTC fine, YET here we are today and the price is falling, don’t rely on people buying in they aren’t at present.
You didn’t need to say bitcoins not ready, I mined BTC in 2011, bitcoin has never been ready, and personally I’ve always thought it’s a failed project, clinging on by its teeth, relying on the pyramid effect for its growth and acceptance.
Like I showed you 5.8 million owners, 7% of owners own 87% of all bitcoins in existence.
None are used, stored in whale wallets, �� deflationary currency hey, you can’t have it both ways, SPENDING v HOARDING, then if that’s not enough the majority of other wallets own one bitcoin or below, I don’t see these hodlers spending their stash, usually the least amounts get stored longest, so prey tell how are you planning on funding this global bitcoin spending spree, just think about how many notes are in circulation and now realise why cash works.
Also it doesn’t matter how divisible a bitcoin is, that still doesn’t mean people will spend them.

Well no actually that’s not how it works in economics, you see what makes the dollar such a winner is it always got constant demand, people want dollars.
Hoarding is the opposite it kills demand, and because there is no demand it effects the whole economic chain.
I know there are people banding around silly schoolboy scenarios that sound wonderful, just like yours, but real economic models don’t work like that.
Well as to the 5.8 million it shows it’s a dire figure, a flea on a giant dogs back, “BUT WAIT FOR IT”, it’s going to take over the world ��, because it’s just so much better and so much cheaper, YEAH of course it is.
There is money to be made for sure I won’t argue there, money to be made of the suckers who buy in, and over the boom and bust cycles will go, until people get bored and it’s name is trash from all the suckers who lose, even today there are loads of people who got raped in 2017/2018, really.

It’s the can’t be bothered attitude though, if you’re passionate about BTC, you’re motivated, if you are not you aren’t, I personally know people who aren’t anti Bitcoin but they just don’t care.
If you’re a Jehovah’s Witness you are fully motivated for the cause and your beliefs, for this to happen you have to be fully behind your beliefs, the problem is you know you’re a niche market just like bitcoin, how do you change the lazy publics attitude and get them on board.

Ummm that’s not what bitcoin people say when you tell them they’ll ban BTC, I think your talking with a forked tongue, and it’s utter crap that another coin can’t be as secure as bitcoin, there are other protocols, proof of work is behind the times I’m afraid.
The challenge to grow usage is bitcoins challenge, as clearly no ones buying in, there are more likely more takers for a superior coin, even most in the cypher punks movement agree.
In the FUTURE, ahh those words, what that means is no one knows, I don’t know, it can’t do, as I hear these words constantly I know BTC isn’t what it was touted as.
Bitcoin an anonymous, peer to peer electronic cash system, that can scale to the same TX per second as visa.
Anonymous “NO”
Peer to peer “NOT” without huge amounts of centralised regulation ��.
Scaling, “IT CANT”
Decentralised “UMMMM”, decentralisation regulated 
Plus bitcoins security is only based on PRICE, once you have no incentive, you have no security, so saying something is a mammoth task, is wrong, and truly all price reliant.

Not a chance, if people in this space haven’t realised yet, how regulatory controls over bitcoin work then they should be ashamed.
Simply put no regulatory body will let institutional money flow in, because it gives bitcoins price credence, instead of what you have today, which is a market and value based upon pure speculation on an asset that has not and does not have any productive value.
So no they won’t give any approvals, and look at the history of companies that have tried, the answer is NO,NO and more NOs.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:17:43
I don’t see it like that at all, if you look at history most first movers get destroyed eventually by a better product.
Also what you’re saying is a contradiction, if you look at most posts on reddit it’s always the future, my question is why not now?.
Also why will there be demand then in the future if the demand isn’t their now, and you can’t call 5.8 million people demand.
Let’s put BTC into perspective, Mexico City has a population of 130 million people, bitcoin has 5.8 million takers at low level prices, now is the time to buy, like all products the more the price increases the less likely they are to buy, and the maths doesn’t lie.

The fact that this post came from someone who is financially more secure than someone who is less financially inept as you are, is just a coincidence, and as I said before I wouldn’t of mentioned this fact, if like a schoolboy you’d not of banded around the 3 day old reddit account rubbish that you thought would turn the tables for you, when in fact is it got you kicked in the teeth.

So basically like I said originally, THEY ARE INDEED STILL AWAITING APPROVAL!!!!!!!!!
And instead now of it being a waiver that can’t be denied, NOW IT CAN !!!!!, also like I said originally.
And clearly it’s not like WHEAT or OIL ��, because it’s price is so volatile, and if you did an ounce of research you clearly find evidence that this is one main reason, authoritative bodies are reluctant to pass any bills condoning its spread.
And clearly you don’t understand the issues of acceptance of physically backed contracts or warehousing, firstly proving to the regulatory authorities that you won’t be hacked is impossible, secondly it’s not about warehousing as I explained to you before it legitimising BTC by letting physically backed contracts exist, CLEARLY it may seem irrational to you, but you are not those people doing their job.
I don’t think your lying, more confused, and have greater belief than other, that’s your prerogative, but I would hazard a guess it comes down to you being invested in some way.

And products and protocols have competition from other protocols and products that’s how markets work, as they are ever changing, and no product or protocol stays the same over time or top of the pile.
This proves that only 5.8 million people own bitcoins, so LOL at your laughably not true, why don’t you take some time and do some reading.

It’s the ifs and maybes that aren’t relevant.

Oh and the irony, so if that one bitcoin, errrhhh, there wouldn’t be one would there if they were so valuable, no one would fund anything or use anything that’s the whole point.

@_date: 2019-01-21 16:11:45
Partly so, but it goes back further than today, also the governments strict price controls which were meant to keep basic goods affordable for the countries poor are partly to blame.
A drop in oil prices and yet again a corrupt government, added to its woes, a lack of maintenance and investment, the list goes on.
But the point here is Bitcoin cannot save them or make their woes go away, plus all these people buying BTC and no rise on a Bitcoin is utter rubbish.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:11:01
No it’s not, you don’t pay tax on money, and your going to find out it doesn’t work as money, when the tax authorities want their cut, because any gain on a crypto currency that you use for a purchase is liable for tax.
Now you maybe aren’t that smart, so let me tell you what this means for bitcoins spread, firstly most people aren’t stupid so they’ll choose to use a fiat currency for payments because the don’t have to pay tax on purchases, but more over most people don’t want to be on the wrong side of the law or the tax authorities, so they aren’t going to use it for payments.
There are only, around about 5.8 million people who actually own Bitcoin, so as a currency it has massive barriers to cross, one of the main ones  is regulation.
Do I listen to regulators, do you pay tax?, seemingly you do and will, so you too listen to regulation, and so does Bitcoin because without those regulations, they the authorities strangle it, via cleaver means and red tape.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:30:23
Bitcoins dammed if it does and dammed if it doesn’t.
The irony is how many misinformed people on reddit think their transaction can’t be traced, and if you tell them, they’ll say I’m fine as I have a privacy wallet. “Yeah right”.
But more to the point, if BTC doesn’t gain the kind of privacy that cash offers, how can anyone say its as good as cash, they simply can’t unless they’re lying or retarded.
The problem with ultimate privacy, it is a direct threat to tax collection and also aids criminal intent (money laundering), not sure the establishment will put up with that.
And if BTC stays in a none privacy state it’s useless for business or the public, unless you like people peaking into your finances.
Then there’s the unforeseen complications that could arise from any of these updates, risks are not good, when so many are invested.
Clearly second generation coins built from the bottom up, can clearly be the answer.
@_date: 2019-01-19 07:54:57
Bitcoin started with 100% of the market and no one knew about it, since the rise of other alts, Bitcoins market share has decreased and usually this is a natural progression.
You see all or any failings bitcoin has are being ironed out in crypto coins being developed moving forward, and for each new coin that comes to market inevitably bitcoin loses more of its market share.
Crypto maybe isn’t stoppable but first movers don’t usually stay at the top, there are many examples of this in business.
Plus when you add in other factors you’re a brave person who can say Bitcoin can’t fail, one of those factors is called novelty, throughout history there have been many things with great promise and a novelty factor that died a death because once people get bored of talking about it, or selling it, when in all truth it’s not selling then natural selection kicks in and you realise it slowly dies, as it’s price declines to Zero.
It’s very dangerous comparing something like the internet, with bitcoin, or any other mainstream product the has gone on to become a
Worldwide success, mainly in the internet’s case there just wasn’t anything else, in bitcoins case there are many.
Beam, grin, elixir, and there are others also being built, even Litecoin has a faster transaction capacity than BTC, yet sure on a sub of bitcoin fanatics of course everything else is doomed, the truth is though is it, or is it BTC that will bite the dust.
Don’t have those eggs in the one basket.
You only need two boundary conditions if you want to take on bitcoin, and they are high enough taxes to deter any investors, and huge amounts of red tape regulation, that’s what you call putting a rope round it’s neck.
And if you don’t believe the illusion of spread have a think about these figures.
0.7 %! of all Bitcoin addresses own 87%!!!!!!, of all the known supply of Bitcoin.
Secondly 97.2% of all other wallets have less than *one Bitcoin* in them.
These figure show clearly bitcoin is completely controlled by a tiny amount of people, just like the worlds richest 10% own most of the fiat money in circulation, yet bitcoins classed as *sound money*, and touted as it can’t be controlled ��, any whale can sell and instantly effect the price or buy and send the price up, volatility doesn’t equal sound money,I’m afraid, and with a market controlled by so few holders I don’t see it as much different to what we have today.
Broadly speaking the richest people on earth, have a monopoly with every new asset, or invention, and inevitably they feed profits of new buyers, holding large supplies give you power over the market.
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:15:10
And I presume then, if you sell it before the years out you’ll pay a capital gains tax?
Now if it is tax free, IMO that means in Germany it is actually a currency, but I am a staunch believer and openly vocal, that in countries like the UK where I live it is not a currency, due to the tax implications.
And I presume even if one opened a German bank account to have money from crypto sales paid in, with the intention of transferring that money to other accounts, would probably be seen as tax avoidance and money laundering.

It’s not the crypto now is it, it’s the ones being worked on now, they’ll be worked and made so they can do these things before release.

Problem you have like anyone who’s convinced by Bitcoin, is you’ve already convinced yourself.
I’m more of a figures guy, kinda don’t care what something can do, more of whether anyone will care or use it.
History is littered with best and new things, that were eventually a complete flop, people are either set in their ways of fickle and move on quickly to the next best thing.
And I do think the bull run of 2017 is exactly how a success story should be, and the reason like you’ve said is it wasn’t a success then because of all its failings, high TX cost, slow TX speeds, couldn’t scale, major bugs, ect ect, oh and the manipulation element of course.
But that said, that was in part real people buying BTC, hungry like satoshi said through FOMO, greed in other words, now move forward and we see less buyers and lower prices.
And it’s hard to get people back who’ve lost a lot, you know I discussed BTC early on with friends and we’d already said there are going to be big losers in this field, and we were correct and all our observations were built on last buyer attitude.
Sentiment from my view point is people are reluctant now to invest, they still don’t get it financially or technologically, and 5.8 million holders is tiny, it really is.
@_date: 2019-01-26 10:22:48
Guy was clearly right though, anyone should of really seen that drop coming, and there are more sell offs coming IMO.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:08:39
I’m pointing out ironically they are just your views , they hold absolutely no pertinence in the real world, for that reason I think people shouldn’t listen to what you’re saying, they should look at history, and have a small idea about the potential hazards to regulating a Wild West asset/currency.
And as for HACKS, that’s called customer protection, do you not “KNOW NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS”, so hows that figure in this warehousing plan, I would and I’m sure they have and will, be asking these questions.
Wow they raised a whole 182million, please it’s chicken feed, barely a green light saying they must approve us now, geez look how many hoops the winkle evils have had to jump through and yet they’re still no anywhere near.
Let’s me ask you a question, you’ll enjoy this because it’s taking things for granted before they’ve happened, let say there is huge demand behind the scenes, what will happen to the BTC price if BAKKT get approval?.
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:48:57
But can you cash that bitcoin out into other fiat currency?.
Or are those capital controls limiting people to only holding bitcoins, because if that is the case (you can’t cash out), I would consider it an even riskier game, and limiting also.
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:30:00
You’ll not overthrow a government in the west, without full backing of the people, that is why we vote, so people voted macron in and at that time that’s what they wanted, the yellow vest are an annoyance to the french government not a threat, if they became a threat they’d be stamped on.
The same for Bitcoin it’s not a threat, so they’re willing to regulate it and see what it can bring, it’s not and never will be a replacement for a system that’s taken hundreds of years to implement, I’m afraid it’s not as simple as out with the old and in with the new, if only it was.
And yes with something like bitcoin you can tell reasonably early I’m afraid, satoshi even remarks about a ten year period, that 10 year period is over, and the figures show it’s not everywhere, I mean I can’t leave my house now and use it anywhere for miles and miles, and the other math also points to a low user base.
So yes I do think it’s spreads was to slow for it to achieve any long term traction, only the people can change that and it’s to complicated and insecure for mass adoption.
The traditional alternative are easy to use, and fine for everyday use, you’ll not persuade normal people different, especially in the west, they’ll get into for speculation mainly.
My view sooner rather than later, there will be a crypto that has a large amount of pre mined coins, that runs on a different algorithm, it will do everything BTC can do and more from the start, with a security that is also as strong, the perfect alternative.
Here’s the catch because like ripple it’s pre mined with many tokens, it won’t have so much of an investment appeal because the returns will be less, but it will be able to scale on a global platform all on the same chain.
And it will happen.

They can do that with bitcoins, plus like I’ve said buying and using bitcoin means you’re taxes twice and you also pay a miners fee.

Well I mined BTC in early 2011, so please don’t try and give me any history lessons on BTC, also I have friends who were active on cypher punk talk forums as early as 1996.
And I said rewind to what you’d previously said, not come at me with a load more jargon, which clearly were IFS, BUTS, AND MAYBES, because you haven’t addressed anything because you base your conversation on none facts.
And I’m not getting your point, until I educated you on the number base BTC has (real adoption figures), you were clueless, and as I said 5.8 million doesn’t back your point of view *CLEARLY NOW DOES IT*, are you getting the point yet.
Or shall I expand, no one cares how far BTC price has gone, personally your eyes would water if you new how much I cashed out December 2017, but the point to addressing what you’ve said is, BTC is based upon speculation this is what gives it value, you’re not telling me it’s value comes because it’s so much better than traditional things that can do the same things as BTC, because that would be silly because it’s not doing those things in the real world on that scale.
Simply your talking rubbish, without anything to back up what you say.
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:10:25
The point is they won’t let institutional money in, it’s called regulatory control, strangulation, and BTC is desperate for this boost, as without that money, it has no takers, and will tank lower and lower and lower.

@_date: 2019-01-26 07:52:16
Oh I’ve only been 1 or 2 years ummm, that’s real funny, how will bitcoin take over cash when it has no demand?.
Of course people don’t need to convert BTC into cash if they want to be left holding an empty bag, but most people do want those profits, and you can’t be anonymous once you cash out to a traditional bank account.
BTC can’t disrupt the banking system, it’s already failed to do that, I assure you the dollar is in more demand than BTC, as only 5.8 million people own BTC ��.
Use BTC to buy things,ummmm, this shows you have not a clue about currency or money, as you don’t spend deflationary currency over inflationary ones, the service or good you buy, should be paid for with the least valued, that wouldn’t be BTC would it.
And make a profit I have, you see way before BTC was born, one of my friends was active on cypher punk talk forums, fast forward to 2011, and he started mining BTC and got me involved also, at that time we amassed a substantial amount of Bitcoins, I personally had 5000, I gave 1000 away to various people in various amounts, I cashed in 1000 BTC in December 2017, when the price in the UK was £12000 that gave me 12 million minus the taxes liable, that may I add have all been paid, I also sold another 1000 BTC at different times for different amounts all the way up to 2017, leaving me today with 1500 BTC left.
So I don’t need to read the white paper, I read it before you’d ever heard of crypto currency, E cash or anything else, I also don’t need to follow every word Andreas antonopolous says, and certainly don’t need to listen to people on reddit who have zero understanding of financial products or how financial systems work.

Nice point, and so true, everyone in Bitcoin changes the goal posts to protect their ideals when Bitcoin fails to deliver.
And it’s failed to deliver on a few points that it was originally sold as being able to do.
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:58:48
1) (no third parties) you don’t call exchanges third parties then?.
2) (no tax) try telling that to the IRS and most other tax authorities world wide, plus you pay tax on purchases, if your crypto has appreciated since you bought it.
3) (no tracking) Bitcoins Ledger is see through, of course transactions can be tracked.
4)(transactions can’t be reversed), so it basically protects the seller and not the buyer (client), I’m sure that people will feel great about not getting their money back hahaha.
5)( no paperwork) so filing tax returns isn’t paperwork.
6) (appreciating value), only if other people buy in, no it doesn’t increase if they don’t buy in.
7) (markets 24/7) yeah you won one ����.
8) (no identity theft) that’s debatable because everyone who interacts with it, has to supply detailed identification, and most of the time you are clueless who you’re trusting it too.
9) (immediate settlement) no it is not, it is slow and can’t scale, waiting for 6 confirmations that can take an hour is not instant.

More crap, this guys basing his theory on the fact demand will outstrip supply, I’m afraid to tell him that’s not the case and hasn’t been for over a year now.
Halvenings will only trigger price rises if demand is outstripping supply, if demand isn’t there effectively you’ll see no uptick.
And what he should be asking is why or how can a halvenings cause demand, if the demand wasn’t in play before, simply it can’t and it will follow the others halvenings  prior and be a none event.
Crap report, crap proof.
Bitcoin is doomed to further loses, and less demand, only a small proportion of miners are actually making a profit, the base price of a Bitcoin is below mining profitability, even the LN network doesn’t put BTC ahead of some of its competitors as they can scale without it, there truly is nothing in the pipeline that BTC can do that others can’t, so why without speculation and without others buying in, which with its tanking price reflects they are not buying in, WHY would it go up in value.
Utter rubbish.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:33:41
No it wasn’t it was exactly what I said it was in my response CRAP TALK, with no meaning, no context, and something you had no explanation for.
So I stand firm on what I originally pointed out, it won’t work and is a white elephant because bitcoin isn’t used, and sensible people won’t use it.
Now when you look at a crypto currency like BEAM, it can scale without an add on layer from day one, and is completely private, no addresses or private information are stored on the Blockchain, and that scalability comes from a compact block size, early day but they’re coming.
Bitcoin will only ever be a weird store of value, and a speculative asset, the real world crypto coins are being built on all others mistakes.

That’s not correct for 2nd gen coin completely, usually “second gen”, move faster into a market and depending on what they can do, can easily take market share of first gen.
BTC market share sinks yearly and has from day one when it held 100%, now it’s around 60%.
Tanking prices can see mining pools quit very quickly reducing BTC security, even with LN bitcoins still going to have scaling problems for mass adoption.
And any 2nd gen that doesn’t need added layers has advantage in the security stakes as long as it has interest and hash power to compete.
User base for BTC is tiny at 5.8 million, so that is easily beaten if a coin promises more, and buying in entry is cheap.
If I had a £1 for everything I’ve seen in life that people said can’t be beat, won’t be beat, and will stay dominant forever, I’d be richer than ever, advancement doesn’t stop.
BTC really is only being patched as everyone knows it failed in it original form, and it’s original vision.

Well considering I mined BTC in 2011 “and I a Redditor for 6 days, I bet I have more BTC than you, plus I’ve seen 8 crashes.
But fever tree tonic water gave better returns than BTC in 2017, does that suit what you asked for, there were also a couple of stocks that out preformed BTC too.
Also whether BTC is up over 2000%, it’s still massively down from its highs, that means it’s been sold off, if you understand supply and demand you know why a low price equal sell off, and more BTC available than takers LOL.

Not your keys not your coins, if investors are so stupid that’s down to them, but being a custodian comes with big risks, immediately hackers know they’re  storing BTC, they will try and get it, sooner or later they’ll be a major hack, I don’t care what insurance they have or claim they have, the point is once they’re hacked, this market loses more credibility, would you let some fool store your coins?.
If your answers no, then you’ll see the outcome, or more the point why they should keep out.
They’re up against an enemy that’s smarter than them, and one that’s patient, same reason you shouldn’t  store coins on exchanges.

There are 5.8 million people own BTC, how mathematically if say 4.8 million are holders, and only 1 million were willing to spend, at today’s rates of adoption, BTC and the LN network would barely be worth implementing, especially the latter.
As LN relies on a currency that won’t be spent, how can If flourish, literally it can’t compete.
May I add Litecoin is far better for goods and services, firstly there are more of them at 84million, it’s faster now on chain, and can also use in the future an LN network, simply put Litecoin may well end up better than BTC, as BTCs growth will be limited by holder mentality.

A tax credit hahahah, no you’re losing 5k, there is no guarantee you’ll have anything to offset The loss against, and your capital gains allowance is only for a year, you can’t save it over and over.
Really do you think 8 billion people can really be bothered with that hassle, just for some new age dream?, you’re kidding yourself.
Yes and of course all merchants are magically going to lower their prices because people use crypto currency, and all banks will vaporise just so people can save on a few fees, fees really are part of life and most people are happy paying them for the insurance, security, and 24/7 /365 day a year back up,geez man what planet are you on.
That’s not how capitalism works.

BTC used to be good, now it’s full of mis informed crap hats, that never listen.
I don’t think anything to bitcoin, I think it’s a failed project, the smart people cashed out long ago, and already looking and waiting for the next alternative, or working on them, and they will come, you can make money if you’re smart with speculation, other than that your sat on nothing, and 95% on reddit aren’t smart enough, and will become bag holders.

The USA can’t ever fall, it’s a complete lie, that’s not how the dollar works, they the USA would have to declare themselves insolvent, yet they won’t because they have a real neat trick.
They can pay their debt obligations by creating the dollars to do so, what the smart part is, because they control their own currency, they pay “NO INTEREST”, basically it’s free money, and they can do this for as long as they like without any effect.
Please believe me when you’re told the USA will be bankrupt they won’t, we are not living in 1929 or the Weimar Republic or Argentina, or the crash in Greece, the dollar is different in many ways.
Also they are lying to you when they tell you that the dollar has lost 90% of its purchasing power, it’s simply not as simple as that, as other factors offset loses.
Believe me coming off the dollar standard won’t happen, even though some countries may want that, it would be suicide for their economies.
The dollar is always in high demand that’s why you can rely on it, and don’t think like some may say that the US government can’t do this or they can’t do that, people who say that are fools, they have the power.

I think you’re wrong, I think network effect is pseudoscience, and everything is linked to mining, because it’s the mining that gives the Blockchain security, and there are only miners there for profit.
Take profit away, or make BTC unrealistic to mine, you’ll lose security, and the house of cards falls to pieces as no holder wants to be come a bag holder.
This is where I don’t get people’s thinking, as once one goes they all go, and thinking mass adoption will happen is no more than wishful thinking, it’s tiny.

In other words the reality is it’s pointless in the real world, this is the same for talk of banning because there are to many people who are invested now.

Yeah right so you’re saying that the German government and the French government and the G20 cannot change their stance on Bitcoin, even though this news has been widely broadcast.
But because you haven’t heard of it or want to believe it, you must be right ��.

I think their records only stay on archive for so long, which is why it’s difficult to get back issues sometimes.

Sure I thought the same when I read the article, if it’s so easy to secure the network why has everyone been putting so much effort in, and let’s not forget the greatness of satoshi vision and I am now led to believe this guy and some researchers have taken a small amount of time and turned Bitcoin on its head.
They state ultimate security at virtually no cost, looking forward to reading their white paper ������‍♂️.

And I believe in Brexit, fuck the EU it’s a failed state.

I’d quite believe that, it won’t stop until the economy collapses, or there are so many homeless on the streets that revolution begins, may sound like strong stuff but with over inflated house prices there are no winners in the long term.
Sooner or later this island will become completely chaotic and crime ridden through injustice.

So basically what they’re saying is Investors that buy Government Bonds at negative yields are doing so because they feel they have no alternatives but to ride this storm and hope for brighter days?.
But do negative yields turn more negative and even less attractive when interest rates are lowered further I’m presuming this is how it works.
And is there an END GAME for this kind of Bond buying and what could that be?.
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:12:56
All of the financial banks are not part of London anyway as they’re not under sovereign rule so no one cares if they leave as they’re a law upon their selves, and no one care about a few car factories and electronics companies.
Geez we are all panicking now ��.
Your funny!.
Do you know what’s the funniest thing about Brexit “it’s the fact that every German tax payer will pay more and more to keep the euro club together, that includes  you my German friend.
You see us in the uk won’t be paying for any failed countries that’s economies shrink or fail down the line, it is the EU with near Zero interest rates, it is also the EU that is set for more QE.
Don’t make out you’re in a good situation you should do some home work ��.
@_date: 2019-09-08 09:44:34
The CME do not settle contracts with Bitcoin, they settle with cash.
BAKKT settle with Bitcoin, hence they have warehousing and need to buy BTC which should put a strain on supply, which increases price as long as demand is high.
Supply and demand is the big deal.
Oh and all the money makers who won’t touch BTC unless it’s through a regulated trusted body like these guys want to offer.
This also is why it’s a big deal.
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:25:36
Not working out to bad in Hong Kong though from my perspective, I wouldn’t say Chinese dictatorship will win in the end, youth is power and just because you’ve not seen an uprising doesn’t mean you won’t.
Yet here we are talking about a western region with many of its populous invested in crypto I would say there is a big difference.
Bring on the revolution i will support it.

It has an effect on the law it’s self, point of reference is the POLL tax in the UK, and May I add the riots this unfair law brought about.
The more you implement laws which take away freedom the more your country becomes no more than a dictatorship and people will only stand for so much law making.

I think all Germans are cunts “period”, I don’t give a fuck about Germans or their views or about Europe as a whole.
You were clearly thrashed in TWO  world wars because your arrogance thought you owned the world “your nation was smashed back into its closet”, and by the way Hitler wasn’t German he was an Austrian ��.
But over Brexit that fat fuck witch who is your chancellor thinks she’s boss of the game, she will find out not and as I’ve said every German will be financially worse off and that for me is a good thing.

I wouldn’t think it would be as easy as passing a law like the article applies.
But it protectionism at its worst again.

Looking and living with interest rates when they are low or negative is fine.
Expecting a 2% inflation target to get people consuming crap, keeping the Wheels going round is fine also.
Rising interest rates and inflation is another subject completely “I’d rather live under a BTC system of saving and money management than be raped with high interest rates.
This experiment we are all in at present that central banks have bestowed upon us all may very well end up in high inflation rates then you’ll be desperate for BTC when you’re losing everything.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:30:23
No it’s not that it’s failed, it’s because even though Bond yields are negative investors are still buying them because they see them as a good long term deal.
Someone with more knowledge should explain in more detail, sadly I cannot.
@_date: 2019-09-07 07:35:22
Bitcoin was meant to be separate from traditional banking systems, it make me laugh when it’s price can tank just off some comments like this.
Does Bitcoin really care if central banks employ their own crypto, NO and it shouldn’t as its separate from them, and be sure no central authority as in BANKS will use Bitcoin because they can’t control it.
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:38:25
Don’t know about banks there but always good to name and shame, stunningly beautiful country BTW.
@_date: 2019-09-01 12:56:08
Wrong France and Germany are going to regulate the bollocks out of Bitcoin if you believe different you’re a fool.
The link you have sent is out of date because as I said that tax free status isn’t going to last as regulation is coming I assure you.
As for Brexit matey it’s already happening, I assure you Boris and the dedicated team he’s assembled will deliver, because the people voted 52% to 48% and that’s what we call democratic voting at its best, suck it up and stop winging.
Hopefully the fog will clear for you, but as a little gift enjoy some REES- MOGG.

We are not leaving the room like an hysterical kid, we just don’t want ass holes with gay names making our laws in the uk.
And how funny you think the EU needs time to sort it woes “pissing myself on the statement”, you’ve read the article clearly so you haven’t got an argument.
For the record the English do not need the EU neither are we afraid of leaving the shitty EU club.

Are you buying off coinbase, if you aren’t you should try.
I use Lloyd’s debit on there and Barclay card, Lloyds will eventually block your card and when you call them to get the Block lifted they’ll say they blocked it because of anti fraud, just get the Block lifted or request a new card by saying you lost the last one.
Should work with the cards you have also.

Yes you’re right and for me the biggest killer of financial freedom is over priced properties and we can only blame the fools who see false paper wealth as real wealth “cheaper housing means you can enjoy life more”, housing should be a right and not based upon how much you earn.

As for Brexit it’s you European bitches who bitch about it not us here in England “we are ready and we don’t care”.

Good luck getting your money.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:06:43
Can’t see why people don’t get Bakkt, they want to be custodians and pay out contracts in BTC and not cash.
This means they have to buy and hold BTC which causes less supply and will inevitably cause price rises, they have 100 million in insurance so they can clearly hold many coins as a result.
All that is needed is now to see how many investors want exposure, if they do have a large uptake BTC will go stellar.

@_date: 2019-05-27 11:07:55
The first guy said it all, and considering most uk banking customers have less than 5k in hard savings banks can promise what ever sum they choose,  and let’s not forget telling the public that the government will pay out on the customer deposits if a bank fails relies on the fact that a  government must have the money in the coffers.
Take your chances, or buy a hardware wallet and know your funds are secure with BTC.
