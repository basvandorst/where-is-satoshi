And once it gets to like 10% then suddenly it's not so hard anymore to get some BTC.. one in ten people has some already, so you can just get a little from your friend that has it.  It seems like since just a few percent of people use Bitcoin it's far away from everyone using it but actually it could happen all at once.

This is just the same faulty logic that makes people think they can buy an ASIC now and get rich.

People are charitable or semi-charitable lots of interesting ways with the tipbot.  Like if someone's thought of a good way to tip some new people that seems like it's working at getting people interested, then other people will tip that tipper to give them more money to tip.  We're flocking, we're flowing. 
If you ever go to the dark web it's like a preview of what the internet will be like once Bitcoin takes over.  Everyone and I mean everyone accepts Bitcoin.  Even every little blog post or anything has a donation address on it.  Because why not, right? ;) 
It redefines what charity means.  You know what I think the best thing is about it?  You can give to charities without getting on their mailing list.  I think it's for good fucking reason the Bible says you're not supposed to tell anyone about your charity.  If people know that you're being charitable it stops being charity any more and starts being a way to get attention and everyone's begging you and treating you different.  With Bitcoin you just drop off your coin in the hat and keep walking.. nothing to worry about.

The miners also need the agreement of just normal people who use the network for transactions, because otherwise they'd be mining "Bitcoins" that aren't worth anything because they're not actually what people are transacting with.

Well yeah.. if you explicitly assume that Bitcoin isn't worth anything at all then, sure.. it isn't worth the resources we spend on it (or anything).  Actually though seeing as it's worth billions of dollars the amount of effort we spend protecting it is totally reasonable.

Nah.. it's no big deal to accept BTC.. you don't have to make a big deal about it.  You don't have to have a giant Bitcoin logo on your front page or email everyone saying "NOW ACCEPTING BITCOOOOOOIN!"  You could just calmly add at the bottom of your payment options, oh yeah and Bitcoin, whatever. 
The businesses I think shouldn't accept Bitcoin are hip avant-garde ones... Bitcoin is so mainstream.

A bitcoin for anything under a thousand dollars is definitely a buy.
