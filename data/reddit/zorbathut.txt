Still happens today, I was just at a gas station that did that last week.
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:53:54
Technically, sure. In reality, gas stations have been doing this for decades, and I see no reason to believe they'll stop anytime soon.

This isn't a particularly good argument. It's possible they didn't know about it.

If he's already doing so, then why did he explicitly say he wasn't already doing so?
If he's not willing to take that risk, then why is he castigating the guy who's also not willing to take that risk?
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:41:54
Maybe, but then he won't have any more money at 20.5 - 21.
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:27:22
At a different price than the seller is. He's only willing to buy if the price goes substantially above 20, he's not willing to buy from the seller's current price. He's not willing to take on the same risks that he wants the seller to.

I can almost guarantee that some people will still keep the entire block history around. Once it's out there, it's always out there.

You only need one coin, or one tiny fraction of a coin, to still exist for the market to still function. Remember that mathematically speaking bitcoins are infinitely divideable - the protocol only supports up to around a hundred millionth of a bitcoin right now, but that's not a mathematical limit, that's just "well, we didn't bother splitting it up further right now".
As long as there is one person holding any bitcoin currency, it can get divvied up and keep the market going. Any attempt to buy out the entire market would just result in the price skyrocketing indefinitely.
If someone was buying *all bitcoins*, and you had the last two bitcoins, and he was offering to buy 'em for a million bucks per bitcoin, would you sell one of them, sell both of them, or sell 1.99 of them? Because I'd do the last option.
He can have the last hundreth once he's offering a billion bucks per bitcoin.
Well . . . 99% of the last hundreth.

Why would he have buy orders at both 20.5 and 19, especially if the buy orders at 19 were enough to consume all his money? He'd never hit the 20.5 orders.
Also, he's said publicly that he's put buy orders at 20.5 and 21. Why wouldn't he just say "I already bought out everything I could afford at 19"?
Essentially, I don't believe he's bought anything yet. He's put his money on the idea that, *if* it passes 20, it will keep going up. He's complaining about someone who's put his money on the idea that it may or may not pass 20. They're not even putting cash on the same thing.

Oh, sure, I'd sell services with it - I'd just be turning the bitcoins back into dollars ASAP. As fantastic as I think Bitcoin is, I personally am not willing to risk its volatility :)

Not really true. Here's a list of worse things that could happen.
* The Bitcoin global log hits a rare case that is improperly coded. Entire Bitcoin network crashes simultaneously. Bitcoin is globally unusable until a patch is released.
* Bug is found in Bitcoin client implementations, allowing for a remote arbitrary execution attack. Hackers break into running Bitcoin clients, get copies of many people's bitcoins, which they then transfer to themselves. (Possibly immediately, possibly gradually over a period of time.)
* Major vulnerability is found in underlying Bitcoin design. Entire Bitcoin system is compromised and must be abandoned.
* The above, except it's found by discovering that someone's been exploiting it for a few months.
The Bitcoin client *is* a monoculture, and rather tautologically, so is the protocol. If there's major problems in it then it is, in fact, quite a big issue.
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:03:56
Why not risk your own money on buying at the current price, thereby eating up all the bitcoins that he's willing to sell?
@_date: 2011-06-12 21:23:43
Personally, if I were trying to buy or sell things with bitcoins, I wouldn't bother holding on to them for a week.
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:42:30
Now that is a fair argument :)
But keep in mind that, obviously, the creators knew about it before anyone else did. By its very nature, they - and their friends - would have a significant early lead on everyone else.

Personally, I'd just get rid of all this. *Most people don't care*. The most popular BitTorrent clients work like this: you push a button, and your torrents start arriving. There's no need to customize all the little tiny settings around your torrents, and most people don't need to worry about multiple addresses.
You have BitCoin. You have a wallet. You have an address. Things sent to your address go to you. Tada. Done. If you want something more complex, get an advanced client.
(Or, if you must, make an "advanced" checkbox that makes it all show up, but seriously most people do not care period.)
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:04:42
Ah, maybe. Although I sort of feel like those buy orders would get consumed quickly, unless he has a *lot* of money on it. But it could be the case.
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:17:55
I'm not sure that's a guarantee at all, though. I mean, yes, *in retrospect* it's true. But what if there was a flat segment, then it kinda bumped up by a dollar or two, and then it fell like a stone again? What if it climbed way up, and he started selling them, and after he sold 1% of his stash it dropped again?
Even at the current price it's taking *over three days* for the seller to dump everything he has. How long would it be taking at 50% higher?
How many people have sell orders still pending, right above the current historical peak, hoping it'll get back there someday so they can finally cash in on their "sure thing"?
The stock market is really easy to play if you have a time machine. It's a bit harder otherwise.
