But gambling in general could be, in my opinion. Sites such as Just-Dice accept thousands of BTC of wagers daily, and it's pretty obvious to see why they're so popular.
Bitcoin helps people get around legal restrictions, plus it's a lot more convenient than sending a bank wire to some overseas non-provably fair casino.

'Mining contracts' are likely to be scams, since there is usually no guarantee that they will pay you. I suggest you looking into buying shares of mining companies such as Labcoin on an exchange such as btc-t.com.
