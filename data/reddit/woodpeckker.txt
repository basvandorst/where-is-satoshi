Price is dependent on the exchange, you scored my friend.

I agree somewhat. We should be patient in our upgrades; but open to discussing various possibilities in the mean time. I'm not arguing for or against any fork, I'm complaining about the current mentality of not accepting change, and being too quick to call an idea a fraud. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:23:42
But every time you do this it means you'll be stoked you bought the last time. I mean you are only buying after seeing profits on every other purchase. Albeit the worst way to get a good return.. still not the worst idea.

One of the points of bitcoin is to have one globally accepted currency, something that is decentralized and used by everyone. What's the point of having 10 currencies that all do the same thing, but aren't compatible with one another, you'd need to accept all 10 as a merchant, or just accept the most used one.. which is by far btc... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:58:21
And I'm not saying this is the case, but I'm 90% sure all the core devs have held bitcoin since the beginning and are pretty well off. When you have a lot of money it can be difficult to rethink things from someone without any money. It's human nature to be selfish. If an upgrade to the network significantly decreased bitcoins value. Like I mean significantly  (like if transactions we near free and people exchanged bitcoin so often that the price remained incredibly stable at 5 dollars) then do you really think the devs would choose to better the tech if it meant significant revenue loss.
And while I don't think this is the case at all, I'm merely trying to point out that since getting rich, these original core devs we idolize might not be the robin hoods they once were.

Thanks bud! You saved my ass

And I'm not saying 2X is the answer, I'm saying not all forks should be seen as an attack and therefore not having replay doesn't instantly make them evil or a scam. Only one coin is supposed to survive when the network upgrades. Spending both coins is basically double spending.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:16:29
It does matter. r/Bitcoin is turning into a rich mans luxury. Minimum wage in my country is under a dollar, that means that the people who need bitcoin most have to work 10 hours of hard labour every time they use the technology, every single time before they can even use money they don't have. An upgrade to the network is not an attack. If you believe that you are doing the right thing and believe the network will agree then you don't need replay, as the old protocol becomes the weaker chain (and we both know what happens to the shortest chain).
Therefore replay isn't always needed.
I'm not saying this fork is the answer, but your resistance to change or see things from the other side is contributing to the growing toxicity of this once beautiful community.
I really love this sub and what bitcoin stands for, but we are forming this circle jerk mentality where we are too cool to give anything new a shot.

The cost of launching satellites has dropped to a 20th of the price is was before btc. We might not have to worry about bandwidth as much as the battery or power. But I'm definitely optimistic 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:40:33
Okay, but you realize that these software upgrades are going to be in the form of a fork. If consensus is reached before the fork then everyone jumps over. No need for replay protection. You aren't supposed to choose both forks. Nor is it meant to act like a dividend. If you believe a fork to be a scam then simply don't use it. "Your" bitcoins would be protected.
This isn't supposed to be about you making money, this is supposed to be a way of users voting which protocol they will run.

Completely agree. I felt Roger was much more knowledgeable and could back up his statements. Some of them I found to be valid, but I felt he was constantly being interrupted and I too would be frustrated by someone wanting to move on simply because they didn't have the knowledge to further debate a point. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:11:08
Do not underestimate the rate at which technology is advancing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:18:14
Well according to the core principle of bitcoin. If 90% upgraded and shifted the value and processing power, and felt that this protocol was more secure (and was not backwards compatible) then anyone running on the old network would be an idiot, but could at any time upgrade  (split their coins) and continue using the new networks (forgetting about the old tokens).
Network upgrades are usually soft forks, but are still forks.
We need to realize that in a year or 10.. someone somewhere is going to come up with a solution that not everyone agrees with.. they are then given the opportunity to run simultaneously and let the userbase choose.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:43:34
You can't ask a vague question and then get upset when people don't interpret it the way you intended. Do you have any idea how banks work? Or is your absolute faith in them enough that you don't actually need to know how internal workings of a bank work? In the last 10 years how many times have you been robbed/hacked and forced to go online and transfer funds? You know what has happened in the last 10 years... one of the greatest stock market crashes in history. Do you know who caused the crash or why it happened? Can you explain inflation to me?

It doesn't have to be bitcoin, it just has to be something of similar concept. Paypal is okay if the global currency is dollars. Dogecoin works but only if you can use it everywhere, else you still need to pay exchange fees. Don't forget that there are still poor families living under a dollar a day. This gives them access to a currency that is peer to peer, where workers in one country can send their mothers in another country some money directly, and not lose half to conversion or fees.. now that might not change your world but it'll change the way the whole world works. We are still a long way but this technology isn't as much a gift to you as those who suffer from poverty, corruption and would like a break.
Of course it is still a massive gift to anyone not poor, who would like to always own the money they have, who doesn't want to give some away to fees and honestly for ease or travel... but yes many say this is a solution looking for a problem.. but once you look under the hood you may find there are lots of problems that need solving.

Autocorrect messed up my title, so I'll give you this one! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:51:52
Who the fuck are you talking about? I'm saying that in order for bitcoin to grow, future forks need to happen. Forks are a way of allowing two versions of the code to run simultaneously. 
If core developers figure out a smarter way to do transactions that require a protocol upgrade they too have to fork and hope for consensus. 
Jesus Christ I hope you are trolling, if you genuinely care I suggest you should learn a lot more and rethink your stance a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:28:59
It was a brilliant idea with poor implementation. Also you can't really compare the two.. I'm not saying do away with the countries government currency, but have a second currency for those who trade and travel across borders. A currency that is deflationary and not controlled by any one institution. You'd link the price of your product to the local price and then convert the total to the bitcoin price of the largest local exchange that is available to your country. This of course works much better when there is a massive user base with huge amounts of coins in circulation. The price will only stabilize when people use it regularly and it trades hands daily. (By the time that happens the price will be determined by the fee of small fast transactions, I'm not saying btc is the answer but we need something secure, cheap and fast, and then only have one or two with completely different functionality, that the whole community is working to always improve.)

This is exactly the mentality I am doing about. I'm not talking about an alt coin I'm talking about the original concept Satoshi created, but I have a feeling that the conversation would be lost on you. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:54:14
And I'm talking about BTC, as in the protocol running on my 0.15 node.

I'm 1 and I drink straight from the tit.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:12:56
And it's worked every time!
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:05:31
This conversation has been lost on me.. so are blocks being added before the previous block was full  (had handled the max transactions it could in the time of being the latest block)
It sounds like you are saying that's bad. Trying to understand, could you help?
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:22:10
Were you around last month? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:55:50
So it is my understanding that the size of the block increases the difficulty of mining, and takes more electricity, so to run blocks bigger than needed will be a waste of resources and squash the already small profit margins, which in turn centralizes mining to those who can pool resources to afford it. 
Please correct me if my understanding is wrong. With my current understanding it also makes it a lot easier for a hostile takeover to occur and protocols to be changes and forced upon users... what would be the advantage of this for large corporations?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:36:09
Could you explain this to me please? Isn't 2x meant to be the post fork alt? How are people accessing and trading on the current network?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:53:29
Hey man, can you tell me about how you have experienced bitcoin living in Europe, a lot of my European friends have barely heard of it
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:54:31
But how are people accessing it now already?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:15:34
I am, pm me if you have anything interesting. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:55:12
Okay so correct me if I am wrong, but what you are saying is: there currently isn't actually 2x coins, but some exchanges fully believe that the fork is going to happen so will allow you to trade the 2x coins as a sort of waiver that if you have traded them now, you won't be entitled to them when the fork happens?
It is my understanding that when and only when the fork happens, the amount of btc you have on the network at the time will be copied onto the new network. So what is stopping someone with one btc from trading that one 2x (or btc1) coin now and using that money to buy more btc before the fork actually happens? Will he then be entitle to the added amounts forked coin? 
And what happens if I have 10 btc now, trade the btc1 coins now, and before the fork I exchange or move my 10 btc coins? Cause then I actually wouldn't get coins?(Or the exchange wouldn't).
I'm not from the USA so a lot of this stuff I only get to hear about through you guys, but I think it would be best if I actually do know what's going on.
And thanks for the reply.
