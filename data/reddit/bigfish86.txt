No because you will only have one identity and also once its on the blockchain its there forever so people will be more cautious of what they post.  Basically we have no choice our current internet has failed. ISPs/Govt have ruined the free place it once was. Theres no privacy and user privacy breaches happening everyday like equifax hacks.

With the crazy advancements with AI that have been happening daily we have no choice. Humans have a hard time understanding things change and we are entering a very special time. Look back 10 years and how different was life then look another 10 years before then..... now picture 10 years from our current time.....

Do you understand what Ethereum is doing? Blockchain is building the next stage of the internet. Its going to be an internet of value. Basically our whole world will be on the blockchain within 10 years.

I think people also dont understand "internet of value" imagine our current internet but imagine if facebook, twitter had a currency to represent its value not just stocks. I see it as the next stage of the internet being merged with the stock market so its one system.
