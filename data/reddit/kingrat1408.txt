*For now.*  I have been sort of curious in an Orwellian way to see how long it takes for God to be invited to the next crypto-convention.

In addition to watching the BTC to USD conversion rate, we can also watch the BTC to crude oil prices. Guys, it'd be a roller coaster on top of a roller coaster!

The use of PGP on SR only protects against LE and from third parties from being able to see critical text, like a name and address.  The hacker set up several different vendor accounts and traded them with each other and aggressively found holes.

This is what customers are looking for in an anonymous bitcoin ATM. IMO identification via palm vein and pin should only be necessary when purchasing bitcoin with a credit/debit card (prevents card theft); but not when paying with hard cash.  
If I have a twenty dollar bill:  
* I should just let the ATM scan the QR code of my wallet  
* Stick the money in the machine  
* Optional email confirmation when there are X+ confirmations when the funds are ready to spend  
For something like a bitcoin ATM, simplicity is key.

Can we see this compared to how the value of bitcoin has changed since it's origin? So South Sudan's currency inflated 80% last year, how has the price of bitcoin changed?

Doesn't someone just have to pay 10k per BTC ONCE?  
You guys could scheme that on LocalBitcoins.com with some friends.

Thank you very much for the reply, I will be checking these links shortly.

Four hours later and no delivery. Four hours later and no surprises.

Yeah I did that too, bought several coins at $80 but I remember seeing it earlier at $30 when I was learning just what it was - took a while to fully take me to invest but I did. Aaand then I sold out in December 2013 when the price was above $900. I wish I was still in.  
It's really, *really* hard for me to accept that I still "won", and that I had some 4-6 BTC at one point, *and still gained more than a factor of 10.* (come on it was 2013 the crypto scene was different Mt Gox was gone and Silk Road was just busted *for the first time)*

I agree, my comment was offensive and gross. Part of me just wrote something I thought would be an appropriate response, even though it isnt.
Which is terrible, changing the status quo is important. It's complacent, and infuriating how my own role in reinforcing the status quo of rape culture came off from my mindless comment. It's exactly the opposite of my own beliefs.    
Thanks for blowing my head open for the day, @_date: 2018-07-31 18:25:39
He has my respect. He basically made Bitcoin what it is today, for a long time, SR1 was the only marketplace you could spend BTC, and that gave legs to the cataclysm that is cryptocurrency.

This is actually the most accurate meme for my life.

I bought a bitcoin at $127 in September, took a 3 months camping trip and came back and saw it over $800. I don't even mind that it is at $690 as of this post. yay

Can you share your presentation with us? I'd love to show *my economics teacher,* but frankly I don't have the time to put together a presentation per se. Especially if you presented it using powerpoint or a presentation from google drive, I would totally give you credit and just educate my teacher on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-15 21:24:36
Thanks you!

Do we know their vendor name?

I love reindexing. Said no one ever.

I did not wipe my original drive, so they must still be there.

My first bitcoin was $10, I wish I invested more.

Thanks for the response! I'll look for the wallet.dat file. I cloned the partition on my old drive to my SSD, so everything must still be intact.  
EDIT: Found them! Now I found a couple of wallet.dat files, presumably the old and new one. I'll let you know how it goes as it is copying now. I copied the whole Bitcoin folder from AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\.  
EDIT: And it gave me a whole new address.  
EDIT: And I figured it out and have my wallet back, with almost 1BTC :D
