Even the lightning node operator can lose their staked btc if something goes wrong. You can't be a lightning node without staking some of your coin btw

The idea is that by having a mesh of lightning nodes, more transactions are able to be routed through the nodes. Reducing the need to open or close new nodes.

You shouldn't assume any network usage is an attack on the network. Bitcoin will need segwit, lightning and all other scaling techniques if we want it to be seen past a speculative asset. Segwit needs to be forced, batched transactions are a must, lightning needs mass adoption, and block sizes will be increased at a safe rate. Otherwise the "attacks" will keep coming when newcomers want to try Bitcoin out.

Crypto markets move so fast it's insane. A peak or floor rarely lasts a day

We need all the news/shilling/fud for the neural net to predict with a reasonable accuracy.
I think it's fairly safe to say bitcoin is near one of the local mins. I think there is a high chance it'll be &gt;= today's current price in a year. With the amount of exposure media outlets are pushing the masses into crypto. Bitcoin is the Tesla of crypto stocks, and will see the most price stability amongst them all

It's not even worth the setup time. Unless those computers have insane graphics cards, you'll won't even break 25 cents an hour with several of them running nicehash.

It is a way of guaranteeing a price for something in the future. If you sign a futures contract to buy 100 btc over the next year at market price. You would pay the same amount for it regardless if it goes up or down. 
So by shorting an asset (betting it will go down), you buy the asset at present($20000) , and sell it back at that price in the future (worth $10000 but the contract states $20000). You would gain $10000 by selling at $20000.

I haven't used that wallet, but I believe you need your seed (the crazy word phrase) to unlock your wallet, and therefore use it. The wallet.dat file is the public key essentially, and is just a reference to your actual wallet. Find that crazy word phrase.
You need to use data recovery software, I'm not an expert on that field so I cannot make a recommendation.
If you indeed find the wallet, do note that you have Bitcoin AND Bitcoin Cash, as well as all the other forked versions in the future (if you decide to hold them)

So you're arguing that bitcoin should not be used to settle small transactions? What's the point of developing the lightning network and the entire debate on bch vs btc?
I doubt btc can be seen as a replacement to fiat anymore. It's an digital asset that can be moved easier a physical one. If you want a fiat replacement, look at an altcoin like ethereum or bitcoin cash, (or bitcoin again once the lightning network is fully operational)

So you're saying that it's better to hold bitcoin than to spend it? What's the point of this entire post if you're going to be contradictory?
Also, it appears that you're a hype driven person. Be careful with your money, and HODL on tight if you believe this is going to be a rocket straight to the moon.

If the solution to cheap and fast transactions is to use lightning? Wouldn't that solution pretty much that we are beginning to be more centralized? Payments within the lightning node will be instant and cheap, compared to payments with other nodes(lightning or not)? 
This feels more like each lightning node becoming a mini bank, transactions within the bank are cheap and fast, transactions to other institutions are slower (unsure about fees on that one).

Why do you think that automation and human ingenuity will reduce prices so low that 'cheap stuff' become free? Someone/something had to produce the product, and that is definitely not free. If it is free, if someone is offering to pay for a resource, why would they provide resources up for donation, towards production of 'cheap stuff'?
Where you are headed towards is a world without money, not a world with cryptocurrencies

You know that they use bitpay, which converts directly back into fiat for the merchant right? 
And no, segwit and LN will not solve the problem. We need full adoption of segwit, LN AND bigger blocks to solve this problem. Opening and closing channels still require transactions on the main blockchain

HODL = Hold On for Dear Life
