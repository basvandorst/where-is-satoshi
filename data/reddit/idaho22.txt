To be fair \- other than Juicero these technologies still exist, the main ones are just not these brands.

Because miners are speculating it will rise. If it keeps dropping cosf will go down.

I mean he could have made an easier point of Venmo vs. Bitcoin.  Next time you go to dinner and forget your wallet \- offer to pay in Bitcoin to either the restaurant or your friends.

Remove the period and this will be the case in 2019

No we should let it be a free market and not let the government involved before they have to be.  Bitcoin will live on just fine.

How about the 80% dip in retail usage?

The one where you buy an ASIC with a credit card and mine the coin so it's private.

Why though? What do they harm?

Ethereum is more of a network where the sum of all the parts back the underlying network.  They are building out some really cool companies within the network and while most of them will fail - the ones that succeed will see massive success and that will increase the value of the network at the aggregate.  
To me, Ethereuem is backed by more than bitcoin (trust) if long term they can add an infrastructure to support what already is a superior technology in terms of transaction times.

Yeah long term answer

According to this nobel prize winner and his model on P/E, the stock market and real estate market have been a bubble for years now.  He's called for a crash twice now.  I've lost a lot of money trusting this guy.

I'll sell you a pizza for your bitcoin in a heartbeat

Learn something new everyday.  I was under the impression Freedom Coins was shut down for trying to create a competing currency and paying their employees w that currency.

What about eth? If the fork in Bitcoin causes the drop - how are they correlated in that capacity? I could see people moving to eth or bailing out.

Bitcoincash has less casual spectators than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:54:54
I think the latter - my bad I'm on a plane and didn't look it up

Holding this guy's expertise over the past few years would have lost you a ton of money in the stock "bubble" he predicted based on his P/E model. The bulk majority of his schooling happened when we were on the gold standard. 
The Cape ratio he won the nobel prize for didn't see the real estate bubble coming.  
Etc etc

Are you saying my statement is preposterous or the law? The law is pretty clear on the issue.  You are basically legally required to pay your employees in US tender.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:34:33
Hodl my beer while I buy all your bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:16:14
This post has been pretty enlightening 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:14:26
Mine will - would have to leave US though 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:02:40
Or blow 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:42:50
You can't accept payment for work in anything but us tender or however you spell it I don't think 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:01:48
He already did. He said you can buy bitcoin when talking about money.
