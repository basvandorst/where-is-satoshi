1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC  
1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
1 bit = 0.000001 BTC  
1 BTC = 1,000,000 bits
A bit is 1/1,000,000th of a bitcoin  
A satoshi (smallest currently possible denomination) is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin

Anyone else notice that in the picture each car appears to be driving in an alternating direction?

I disagree that brainwallets are universally unadvisable. Like any Bitcoin storage strategy, brainwallets have their unique pros and cons.
A properly generated brainwallet passphrase with sufficient entropy can be one of the most secure ways to store Bitcoin.
I wrote this quick javascript fiddle to emphasize how secure a randomly generated 12 word passphrase can be against brute-force attacks.
With 1,000,000,000x the total hashing rate of the entire Bitcoin network today (August 2015), a randomly generated 12 word passphrase (selected from a set of 8000 words) would take an attacker an average of 2,723,850,390,664.6494 years to brute force attack (50% success probability after this much time). For comparison, the age of our planet is ~4,600,000,000 years.

Not to be hyper technical but I think it was actually for selling explosives.

This is an overly heavy handed approach to moderation.

I paid 1.2 million bits for my hotel room in Boston this week. (hopefully, someday, that amount for a hotel room for one night will be preposterous)

In 3 years will we see a trial like this?
