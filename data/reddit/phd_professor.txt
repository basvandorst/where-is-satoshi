Wow, you guys really drink the koolaid, don't you? You really think the success or failure of a business hinges on whether they accept bitcoin?

Bitcoin - now used for drugs, porn, and second-rate sites that wish they were Amazon!

Well that's fucking stupid. Amazon sells a lot more stuff than Newegg. Where is he going to buy his books? I'm sure anybody enlightened enough to use bitcoin must be a voracious reader.

Bitcoin is going to hit $10,000 any day now, you should've saved your BTC

He was actually saying that Amazon will fail, but some other dude decided that couldn't possibly be true because that would make a bitcoin supporter look *stupid*, and you're all geniuses - you'd have to be, if you're supporting the world's best cryptocurrency!

As a skeptic I can say that the only reason businesses are going along with this is to drain money from nerd hoarders of bitcoins.
See, before, nobody could spend their bitcoins on anything. Now, each new store that accepts bitcoins can make millions of dollars because the people with bitcoins will feel compelled to spend them on something now that they can.
Newegg will make tons of money on this and then stop accepting bitcoins the second some real shit goes down.
It's a currency whose entire market can be manipulated, the value of which has fluctuated immensely in the past two months alone. This is not a stable currency. Crashes are inevitable and have been frequent. Market manipulation is rampant. Fraud is rampant. A stable currency cannot lose 50% of it's value in a period of weeks.
