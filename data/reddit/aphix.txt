What else would you call the top middle one?

PnD? Pump &amp; Dump? Never seen it abbreviated like that-

Ooh! Can we do a joint venture?  I want to sell megaphones to hecklers.

Like how the Dutch invaded New Amsterdam and the Brits called it New York.

Initially downvoted, then thought about it and I agree. Physical assets are *generally* more easily stolen.

Cool! However, I was making a [leetspeak]( joke.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:03:53
Awesome! But according to the post, Wire is 1337.

There's a button for that, no need to comment.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:52:55
Interesting; that sounds like kindof an important feature, no?
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:01:56
Gotcha, thanks! FWIW I didn't mean that as a criticism or complaint, though when it comes to wallet apps, I'd prefer them to be a bit battle-tested before risking any assets, haha. We do need more app devs, or at least more code contributors in this space for sure.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:53:24
Thanks! I'll check it out- 
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:50:24
Are there any Android clients that are worth checking out?

Unfortunately anything that "may affect commerce" can fall under FTC/state commerce jurisdiction, and not moving money through their channels will easily be ruled as having an effect.

Who do you think defines what a corporation is? Who do you think defines their boundaries? Who do you think a corporation would lobby to change or enforce those boundaries?

Technically, everyone making over $34k/year is in the top 1% of the world.

They can ask if they're curious; it's been a while since I've done it, so I don't have sources readily available, apologies.

Just Coinbase, use the little bell icon (top-right in-app) to setup price notifications-
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:47:10
Ha. That had to result in some confusing responses.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:39:31
Probably wouldn't be too difficult to crack open the xpi/browser extension and see the apis it's working with if you're generally curious and have a basic programming knowledge, specifically with JavaScript. That or at least open the dev tools network tab when making a purchase (make sure to check "preserve logs"!) and watch the request/response.

Did you know you can blow your eardrums out with inaudible frequencies? So if nobody heard it, it still made a sound. Technically sound is a range of perceptible frequencies by ears as interpreted by a brain.
Also who cares, the next person in the woods sees a downed tree.

Hope is a hell of a drug.

The cynic in me agrees. Probably gonna be a hit piece on the entire sector.

In what real scenarios has BTC been more useful than the country fiat for you, personally?

CA wanted state's rights when it came to pushing back the feds with regards to cannabis regulation.
Oh right. Generalizations, indeed, agreed.

If you have the old phone you can pull the auth file with the seed off, or use a shell script to generate the numbers from the file on the fly.
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:13:24
You can extract the auth file and either hit it with a script to generate the numbers for 2fa on the fly, or clone the file to the new phone outright.
