It's amazing how many people in this sub will attack you for trading, they call it "gambling" because they couldn't take the time to understand how to do it properly and got burnt from making stupid decisions. They don't understand risk management, they cant read charts or spot support and resistance zones, and they chalk successful traders up to pure luck.

Hahahaha this is hilarious! Have you heard of this magical thing in trading called a stop loss? you know, to limit your loss if a trade doesn't work out in your favor? Are you familiar with low risk high reward trade setups? I.E. placing a stoploss to where you can only lose 2% of your portfolio for a potential 10-20 even 30% gain???? If this is too complicated for you then yes, HODL forever. Some people want to increase their btc holding significantly and trading is the only way to do that. I have many friends who trade full time and successfully make 100$ a day easily sitting behind their computers. One unexpected crash and it’s over if you’re completely brain dead and are trading with your entire portfolio without a stop loss*

Great reply, off topic but do you believe any countries own bitcoin or just private investors? I read that the US government seized around 110k bitcoin when they caught the Silk Road operator but later auctioned them off.

What about China? I read a large percentage of mining  is done there since their hydroelectricity is so cheap

The point is people will never stop buying bitcoin. The vast majority of the supply is already in circulation. The money you work for today is printed out of thin air in infinite amounts, this is not true for bitcoin.

When people stop buying it

How difficult is it to run one? do you need to know how to code?
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:29:00
Nevertheless I thought it was amazing that someone his age had so much appreciation for bitcoin. I’ve truthfully never seen anyone over 40 have so much appreciation for crypto currencies.

That doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s still interesting to think about? So you’re telling me that because you as an individual deem a particular stream of information as “useless” no one should ever ponder or think about said information? You don’t think that anyone ever said that to satoshi himself? “Why conceptualize magic internet money when we have dollars? That idea is useless I can buy anything I need with my fiat dollars”

Thank you!

Wow great video I love that guy! Thanks for sharing, however it is still extremely interesting to hypothesize what the fate of the creator was!!
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:00:26
This guy has the right idea

Broke down some bitcoin and rolled up a few satoshi then ripped that bitch straight to the dome baby!!
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:18:00
No offense but how on earth did you fall for that?
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:28:43
Hey dude don’t get angry some people make your salary in one trade, just by using their brain.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:50:09
Wow that is surprising, all coins are not accepted? Even if 4 quarters are equivalent to one USD?
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:08:26
Over 20k in bitcoin and you couldn’t spend 100$ to buy a hardware wallet to ensure your funds were properly secured?
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:44:36
I don’t know how much you pay for wow gold but one coin is about 10,550 USD in America right now, seems like the dollar crashed rather hard compared to bitcoin

If I moved to Venezuela with 1,000 usd how rich would I be? Also can I walk around with a bag of pennies and go shopping?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:07:31
That is absolutely insane, I just watched it fall off a cliff but 400M in Longs? Sheeesh
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:07:07
So when bitcoin went from 2k~ to 20k~ that was due to a drastic improvement in the bitcoin infrastructure??? And then when it went from 20k to 3k that was because there was a loss of infrastructure?
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:23:09
I agree, I do not believe that a rise in price is a direct correlation to improved infrastructure as the above comment suggested.

I feel like everyone saying not to leverage trade just got burnt really bad because they don’t understand risk management, can’t understand technical indicators, and doesn’t know how to spot support/resistance levels. It’s not even close to gambling if you take to time to understand these things and don’t make stupid decisions/over leverage yourself. It is a legit career path if you put the effort in to understand and respect the market. Not for noobies sadly, just stack and hodl.
