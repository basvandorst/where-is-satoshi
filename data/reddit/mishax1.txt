"those coins would have been sitting in storage the whole time anyway."   exactly my thoughts..   although..I would be paying 0.16btc per month for the electricity(at the current 580$ price).  
So, instead of paying 100$ for electricity every month, so better buy Bitcoin with the 100$.

Sure, it's not a good idea to put a lot of money into LN, but:
a. They can put just enough to cover all the small txs, which will serve well users with small amounts.

There are cheaper ways to mix your coins anyway..

You can set an auto buy periodic option and buy small amounts every day/week for example on Coinbase.

You might want to check out the fees first -

Sorry, I meant 'incoming' connections.  Your node should be reachable on  if you have everything working properly. 
UPNP is usually being enabled by default in most routers today.. so unless you worry about a malware on your pc taking advantage of the upnp and you're not using p2p apps , online gaming and voip programs you can keep upnp off.
You can read more about it here -

Create wallet (electrum would be a good choice), backup the seed, put some Bitcoins in it. 
Save the unencrypted seed on the USB stick.
Another option is to create a paper wallet, load it with Bitcoin(after you save it) and store it on the usb stick or a paper as well. 
You can also encrypt it with his name/date of birth or something..
You can use the site offline as well.

No mislead, mind the difference between USD and BTC value.
If Bitcoin costs $1,000,000 then even a 5sat/byte tx makes it about 1000sat tx fee which is $10 \(and that is if you ONLY have 1\(?!\) output\).

I'm also happy for you bro, I would've done the same thing if the S9 would be cheaper.. because paying 3.7btc for it kinda breaks logic (unless you already got a lot of it and you just want to support the network).

The best way to learn about LN is to experience with it.   
So, you could try  [  , there is an explanation on installing/using it , and also how to use it over TOR. 
  
You can then spend with LN on  [   
Exchange / topup channels / empty channels on -  [ 
or just open an empty channel for free to receive a payment right away on -  [ 
Good Luck

That's a market manipulation on Kraken on low volume.. 
Sell 20btc worth of usdt on kraken and dump 1000 on the market at premium.
The guy is so obvious with a 600K sell wall at 0.9 usd/usdt.

You can bitch about on that seems to be the best solution these days.

Actually they want the exchanges to shut their trading bots that boost volume.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:52:02
Problem is that businesses don't include the discount(not including the visa fee) for cash/bitcoin payments, you wouldn't complain about the "high" fees since you would still pay less using bitcoin..

Wrong.  bigger blocks will only mean that we will need to carry these spam txs forever, consuming more storage and bandwidth and centralizing the network.

Is it somehow related to the 99bitcoins website ? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:35:51
EVERY single Bitcoin user/trader had the same experience as you did, you are not special. 
It is always a matter of when and how much, and the one thing that I've learned from trading the last 4 years, is "Buy the Dips" and "Don't spend it(fiat) all at once".

@_date: 2017-01-27 17:51:41
I live in Israel, I didn't get any proof of residence in English. And I was pissed when they blocked me out of my account, that is why I just sent them the drivers id.  I didn't actually try to withdraw the funds using the android app, I only guessed that If I had access to it I could do it any time, I guess I was wrong.

Chinese 5m trading volume was to disguise market manipulations and cause huge losses to the traders (many lost millions in leveraged trading, and "server overloads").  Has anyone tried to analyze a 5m Bitcoin trades on each exchange ?

I would guess that they have laundered about 1$ billion since the peaks in 2017 starting with amounts of 50btc being sent from poloniex(which can be easily identified because of a kyc/aml on their platform)..
It is highly unlikely that these are all random donations.

Actually this kind of crap should not even exist..
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:27:23
No, I said we seen it before, and it's happening again in the last 24h.  
Mempool isn't normal, it's easy to fill up the mempool with zero to low fees.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:47:07
It's network spam -  
Should have paid a normal fee when dealing with high amounts.

Didn't you backup the seed/keys for the wallet?

I know the mempool is "fine", I know a low fee is used.  
But it seems that these addresses has been doing this for a long time.. (also when the fees were much higher)..

Oh ok,
considering the fact they have pretty much explained the error to you and have pushed a fix, it seems you are being a bit dramatic, just like in telegram which is probably why they removed you.
And if you need reliable payment wallets you might want to consider other wallets than alpha versions..

My little guess would be that Gavin is "more" Satoshi than Craig and Craig is only a clown puppet. 
They agreed that Gavin pays good money to craig to play the role of satoshi without any proof and only by believing gavin's word on it. which fits perfectly since there's no cryptographic proof.

Really ?  only 4 ?   I've been in Budapest about 3 years ago and used 2 of the three ATMs there..  
@_date: 2016-12-05 06:09:08
Thats OK, because that higher fee tx will likely get confirmation anyway within the next few blocks, but a low fee tx could stuck in limbo for 72h (like mine did when I withdrew btc from an exchange). Anyway, we are talking on only 100 txs out of 2000+ that being confirmed in a block. And don't forget that ViaBTC is only ~5% of the hashrate.. so that's not a big deal, though it is a big deal when your withdrawal is stuck from 72h.

@_date: 2016-12-25 17:44:47
I see what you mean, and it seems that on Dec 2nd there was a sudden [hashrate]( drop of what it looks to be a little less than 10%..      
But, these things still can't explain the sudden X10 increase in TXs unless you analyze them on that date.    Also, I have to remind you that there were several times when we experienced these abnormal high TXs count increases, and I must note that they happened on days when the block size debate was on fire.  Take it how ever you like. These increases are fishy and maybe they need to be analyzed.
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:27:13
This somehow makes sense, thanks
yet I still don't see a reason why that address receiving txs of 70 inputs and later send small amount to other addresses which later return more small amounts to that address ..

Keep your Bitcoin on a hard wallet. Trezor is highly recommended.  
Stay away from altcoin as they will disappoint you, if you're really interested in an alt, be patient and buy it when it hits the floor and the volume is low, it will then probably go lower, so be ready to buy a bit more, then wait for the pump, and vice-versa, there is always a pump, and a dump.

"With these technologies, users no longer complete Web forms to provide payment credentials, shipping information, and contact information.

"Why are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the “Bitcoin Core” software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. **Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as “disloyalty” —and they’re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a “split” and cause investor panic."**

**"Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow."**

For more than a year, I have been saying that the spam was caused by big miners that collect the higher fees back (since the fee algo is not very much optimized on most of the wallets causing the users to pay much higher fees than the spammer). The spam practically stopped when the current blocksize debate made huge progress with segwitx2 / BU / BIP91... ect..

The new Trezor has a pin that you type on-screen, which is cool.
