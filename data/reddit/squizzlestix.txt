Ignore. Just testing if I'm banned from commenting too.

Any discussion about bitcoin block size is 'promoting a contentious hard fork'? OK bot.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:31:25
Is there rehab for 1X advocates suffering from hindsight? 
2X was a take over attempt that I certainly didn't support. However, given the current state, I would definitely support Core doubling the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:17:45
You are right. However, if this happens it is likely that other sha256 coins will have overtaken bitcoin's popularity. Bitcoin may then only have a fraction of the total sha256 hash rate. This makes it vulnerable to centralization and 51%.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:54:13
Can someone reply to confirm? (sorry for using this thread)
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:16:55
Thanks. I am getting a bot response as soon as I post a new thread. Probably deserved though.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:08:10
I would say probable.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:11:29
That is what I would have guessed as the better hedge. It is clearly not happening atm.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:31:00
Look at all the comments and only '1 point (67% upvoted)'. I could be wrong but there are a lot of comments. I upvoted.

The best defense against FUD are rational counter arguments. Why not respond to the original thread?
Bitcoin investment is risky. It is not an attack on bitcoin to remind people that they should not invest more than they can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:55:12
Bitcoin anxiety exists whether you buy, hold, or sell. It is a curse. 
This forum is a bad place to ask for advice (including mine). The best thing you can do is educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:23:08
Not everything has to be a conspiracy. Even if this is a FUD post why not answer it with an intelligent reply? It is a reasonable question.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:50:12
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:17:28
Obvious FUD post
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:32:24
If the chain is frozen, how long do you think it will last?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:42:46
Sell your btc now.
[Edit] That was a bit mean, sorry. I recommend you learn about the November hard fork ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:29:17
OR YOU WILL MISS OUT! EVERYONE ELSE WILL GET RICH! YOU WILL LIVE YOUR LIFE REGRETTING THIS MOMENT! THE FORK WILL DOUBLE YOUR FORTUNE!!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:41:09
You are ignoring the BCH threat (which is controlled by bitmain). B2X doesn't have to be the most profitable to win. If BCH becomes the most profitable chain for long enough, B2X will become bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:13:22
Wait, hold on a second. I think this could make me very rich.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:07:33
If you are OK with B2X then it shouldn't be a concern.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:21:08
It looks like we can't talk about potential attacks on bitcoin now. Great.   
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:10:29
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:34:57
Nice one! Just be aware that HODLing is a bit of an extreme sport for November :) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:04:13
Found it on the second page of 'new'. My page says '1 point (67% upvoted)'
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:21:58
The price is going up because people are stupid. 100,000 new coinbase accounts in 1 day? What percentage of these people understand that bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) is facing the biggest challenge it has ever had? 
Miners don't have the the kind of economic capacity you are suggesting, and if they did, there are more effective ways to attack btc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:52:42
It is a done deal. It is not about blocksize anymore. 
If core had folded, what would be the next demand? An increase in total coin supply?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:16:41
Watch BCH. If it becomes the most profitable chain, it is likely there will be almost nobody mining btc (core). Note that BCH is switching to a new EDA on the 13th (timing?) which is likely to increase mining profitability.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:19:26
No shit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:59:21
But what if there was a hard fork with no replay protection, and one of the forked coins might get frozen due to no miners, and you might want to transfer one of the coins because the price is crashing and you need to sell before the price hits 0?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:34:42
The core devs will move on, and likely create something else awesome. Users, unfortunately, don't have much say.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:47:19
For the ultra paranoid, BCH may have been designed all along to be the most profitable chain during the BTC fork. After B2X wins, it becomes mostly irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:01:45
It is a BTC fork and yes it could be totally fine. If you are worried I'd recommend reading more about the potential implications. 's responses to this post give some good insight.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:58:52
Did we get censored?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:48:53
But when will which one be called what?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:26:00
The hardcore NYA miners will mine B2X regardless. Most of the rest will mine the most profitable chain. If BCH is the most profitable chain at that time and can sustain it, BTC (core) will have a very bad time.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:47:20
1. BTC (core/B1X) wins. Cleanly and quickly.
2. Cryptocurrency is fucked (for a while).
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:31:57
I'm curious about this too. Partially I think BCH has become the hedge against the fork. 
The whole thing seems nuts. If the fork REALLY fucks things up, there is no safe harbor. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:03:39
Slightly unusual though
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:30:43
Sell. Wait for the dust to settle. Considering getting back in towards the end of November. 
Alternatively get thoroughly educated about the upcoming fork and decide for yourself whether November's risk/reward ratio is worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:14:08
My personal advice? Relax, wait until the end of November, then make your decision.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:38:57
And I'd trade it all if we could just not fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:19:26
Sorry I was trying to be funny. I agree with your advice, just not a fan of the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:13:05
I read what you posted. That seems to be the same thing that any OS project would state. I am interested in the decision making hierarchies involved which are often very centralized.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:42:34
Thanks, but it doesn't really answer my question. Without miner consensus, how will btc governance work?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:04:10
Thanks for replying and I appreciate your dispassionate economic view. It will be interesting to see what happens :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:45:57
They are not getting rid of it. They are changing it in a way that is currently unclear.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:36:19
Thanks mate. I will do some more reading. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:53:44
Ok gotcha :) I'm actually asking about the protocol. i guess I'm asking about the decision making hierarchy and howit actually works.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:35:43
My mistake, I meant the group or team or foundation. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:46:52
Ok, but should bitcoin be controlled by 400 developers (and I'm sure there is a power hierarchy in that)? 
I agree that it seems like the best option we currently have, but do you think it is sustainable as the system of bitcoin governance?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:32:11
Thanks mate :) That does sound pretty good. I'm not suggesting an alternative, but I'm worried about losing the concept of consensus and whether this community approach is strong enough to resist corporate takeover and also be dynamic enough to respond to change as needed. I'll do some more research as others have suggested.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:21:53
Thanks for this, much appreciated :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:37:37
They are changing the eda on the 13th.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:56:37
Thanks, but who accepts the edits (and how)?
