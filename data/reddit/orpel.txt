I'm afraid your third point isn't entirely correct. You can simply short more bitcoin at the lower price. It doesn't matter if the price is $20k or $10k, if you short $1 million at either price and then the price falls by fifty percent you will make the same amount of money. 
Just remember that the leverage isn't very much on these futures and you can only ever make double your money times the leverage on a short position even if the asset goes to zero.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:36:02
Most of what you said is a false dichotomy. It's as though you can't comprehend bitcoin being a digital equivalent of cash and it has to be one or the other:
I would say that it is used for money laundering and tax evasion as well as the dollar and all other currencies being used for these purposes. It would be naive to think it isn't.
Tulip mania is just silly, tulips don't disrupt anything.
It could be a bubble or it might not be.
There definitely is regulatory oversight because regulators have created rules about exchanging bitcoin. It's just a question of enforcement. CGT, etc
It is used for drug dealing, take a look at the dark web.
No idea if it is used to fund terrorism put I wouldn't be surprised because it has value and is easy to send over seas.

Algorithms which determine fee's in wallets look at the size of the mempool so in the context of what we are discussing it matters a lot.
If miners send .1 in fees then they can raise other peoples transaction fees meaning that they may receive more than .1 back. If it is a transaction for the purpose of manipulating fees then they would be sending bitcoin to themselves so in the context of wanting to get a transaction through the most profitable thing to do would be to not send a transaction at all, but we're not talking about getting transactions through we are talking about adding high fee transactions to the mempool in order to confuse the fee calculation algorithms within wallets. The block rewards are distributed but im not sure the fee's are and the fact that they take an operating fee adds a variable to the game theory which might make my case for spamming actually viable. By the creation of blocks I mean that the pools which create and broadcast the blocks are very limited, 3 pools comprise almost 50% of the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:40:27
No I mean as a general principal that doing anything at all (such as reducing utility) which increases profits will be what they do. I also think you're confusing the owners of the mining equipment who generate hashes with the operators of the pools who sign the blocks and take an operating fee. I also think that it's probably absurd to talk about long break even periods on something which has doubled in value in 8 weeks and increased by an order of magnitude in value within a year.

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:04:18
Wouldn't it be better for them if the low fee transactions don't get mined? That way they increase transaction fee's because there are more low fee transactions in the mempool but because they don't get mined they get dropped eventually costing them nothing?
Surely if they broadcast high fees they will indeed loose any which they don't mine but if other miners are doing the same then they will get them back when they do mine, and as it is also users that are now broadcasting with high fee's the sum of the value of fees will exceed that of the sum of the fees being created by miners?
Im no expert though, this was just a thought I had and I will concede that you may be completely correct in that the maths doesn't play out positively for the miners if they were to attempt this.

Full text:
Ministers are launching a crackdown on the virtual currency Bitcoin amid growing concern it is being used to launder money and dodge tax.
The Treasury has disclosed plans to regulate the Bitcoin that will force traders in so-called crypto-currencies to disclose their identities and report suspicious activity. 
Until now, anybody buying and selling Bitcoins and other  digital currencies have been able to do so anonymously, making it attractive to criminals and tax avoiders.
But the Treasury has now said it intends to begin regulating the virtual currency, which has a total value of £145 billion, to bring it in line with rules on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. 
The new rules, which will be applied across the European Union, are expected to come into force by the end of the year or early in 2018, the minister in charge has said.
John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said he expected to hold an inquiry into the need for better regulation of Bitcoin and other alternative currencies in the new year.
He said: "These new forms of exchange are expanding rapidly and we've got to make sure we don't get left behind - that's particularly important in terms of money-laundering, terrorism or pure theft.
"I'm not convinced that the regulatory authorities are keeping up to speed. I would be surprised if the committee doesn't have an inquiry next year.
"It would be timely to have a proper look at what this means. It may be that we want speed up our use of these kinds of thing in this country, but that makes it all the more important that we don't have a regulatory lag."
The changes come amid increasing fears that Bitcoin is being used by gangs to launder the proceeds of crime while also attracting currency speculators - with the value of the coin soaring in the past 12 months.
The value of a single Bitcoin unit has increased 12-fold this year from about £720 in January to currently trade at £8,700. Last week the currency rose by 13 per cent in just 12 hours.
The number of bitcoin users is estimated at about three million worldwide, according to a Cambridge University study done earlier this year. It is unclear how many of them are in the UK.
The new regulations are expected to be included in amendments to current European Union wide legislation designed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. 
The changes will see exchange platforms, where digital currencies are bought and sold similar to a bureau de change, and wallet providers, where virtual currencies are stored similar to a bank, obliged to report suspicious transactions and carry out due diligence on customers. That means the identities of Bitcoin users will no longer remain anonymous.
Stephen Barclay, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, revealed plans to change the legislation in a written parliamentary answer. 
Mr Barclay said: “The UK government is currently negotiating amendments [to the anti-money-laundering directive] that will bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers into Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulation, which will result in these firms’ activities being overseen by national competent authorities for these areas. 
“We expect these negotiations to conclude at EU level in late 2017/early 2018.”
A Treasury spokesman said last night: “We intend to update regulation to bring virtual currency exchange platforms into Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulation.”
In May, parts of the NHS as well as organisations around the world were brought to a standstill by computer hackers who demanded a ransom paid in Bitcoins to unlock computers.
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the global investment firm, has claimed that Bitcoin is an “index of money laundering”, adding; “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world. That’s all it is.”
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City regulator, has warned consumers against speculating on the price of Bitcoins and other virtual currencies. The FCA described financial spread bets’ on the value of crypto-currencies as “extremely high risk” and to be avoided by all but experienced investors.
Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said; “Bitcoin is a commodity in my view, it’s not a currency” and described its pricing as “very volatile.”
Chris Evans, a Labour MP who has campaigned for greater regulation of Bitcoin and other currencies in the wake of the NHS ransomware attack, said: “We need to crack down on the criminal gangs trading in bitcoins. There is a wild west element at the moment.”
He welcomed the treasury’s decision to support the change to EU amendment but said the bitcoin and others served a useful purpose. Supporters of digital currencies insist that the likes of bitcoin are entirely legitimate and useful means to buy and sell goods without resorting to national currencies that are subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
Dr Constantino Grasso, a business management and law lecturer specialising in money laundering, said that the bitcoin economy was “already huge” and said regulation was needed but would not dampen the growth in digital currency. He said that “anonymity was appealing to criminals” but that gangs played only a small part in driving the bitcoin growth.
 Dr Grasso has estimated that about 15 per cent of exchange platforms are based in the UK, suggesting the British market is one of the strongest in the world.
Over the weekend it emerged that two twin brothers had become the world's first Bitcoin billionaires. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who once sued Mark Zuckerberg claiming he stole their idea for Facebook, made the money after making an £8m bet on the currency four years ago.

There are multiple wallets with 2/3's of the entire bitcoin in existence? Wow your maths is way beyond me.
Sarcasm aside I think you'll find that the largest addresses other than satoshi's are in the region of 150,000BTC which would equate to $1.5 Billion at $10,000/BTC. Sure Satoshi has over 1M BTC which would give him $10 Billion, but even then he wouldn't be the richest man in the world and he could never sell all of his bitcoin at that price anyway. Even at $100k/btc we would only have created a couple hundred billionaires and satoshi would probably be the richest man/woman in the world with $100 Billion.
So to conclude, your maths is wrong.

So on the first point you agree that miners could inflate the fees through low transactions that will never get mined thereby increasing their profits from the fees that they mine?
On the second point. Im unsure that they would necessarily suffer a net loss. If you can send x amount of high fee transactions which increases fees across the board and then mine x+n transactions with roughly the same fees. Also who gets the fee's mined by pools and don't pool operators keep a percentage of the rewards anyway? The hashing is distributed and decentralized but the actual creation of blocks isn't.

They take a short position at 1/1 leverage. Then if the price of bitcoin in USD goes down the positions value increases, if the price decreases in dollars then the positions value increases. This means the position will always have the same value in dollars.

Yeh well said. We'll see what happens but at the moment bitcoin is a political statement rather than a progressing technology from a user perspective. I'm not worried too much though (worry constituting me thinking bitcoin will not survive). It's an entirely new reality for people in finance and it'll take time for them to realise that they need to integrate or be innovated around, if they can at all.
EDIT: I guess what i'm trying to say is that a mass consumer identify as bitcoin users might not be necessary for the moon (whatever your moon is).

Yeh just looked up how public keys are calculated and it's very unlikely you will create a valid address accidentally. The last 4 bytes are the checksum. You take the first 4 bytes of the address minus the checksum (obviously) sha-256'd twice. So yeh it's very unlikely.

I generally just tell people that if they download a bitcoin wallet to their phone I'll send them some. Much better than giving out paper wallets to noobs as it's a bit of a mind fuck when you tell people you can send money to a piece of paper then take it off again. Also if they don't know about bitcoin they will probably then ask you. People are a lot more likely to listen when they ask the question rather than you either just talking at them about it or asking them if they've heard of it then talking at them about it.

Where did I mention tipping only 100 bits? 


Why does someone have to be interested in tech in order to want money? 


Redistributing wealth from richer to poorer countries is a good enough reason for me but I'm sure you can also find someone who has entertained you enough from a poorer country if that's what it takes. 


That last statement makes no sense, people here clearly do have time to spare that's why they're on reddit.


Yes Redditers from poor countries obviously can be richer than you, and vice versa, so therefore we shouldn't tip anyone from those places? Even if someone doesn't necessarily need the money to survive it's still REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH from a rich economy to a poor one.




I guess, it's hard not to offend someone though no matter what you do. I'll concede that people will be offended, but I don't really care as long as it goes even a tiny way to helping fix the inequity of the world.

You do realize i'm asking more of Satoshi than just it's either a good or a bad idea? I'm asking for him to review the "code" (more accurately the sidechain whitepaper) As he is clearly a genius and probably understands Bitcoin better than anyone it would be logical for him to say either he finds no fault in it or he does.
That doesn't mean his word is gospel, it just means if anyone is likely to find a bug it's Satoshi. I have studied both Computer Science and Philosophy at a high level, please don't assume I take the word of anyone. I will evaluate what Satoshi has to say if and when he/she/they say anything.

I tried using a Uint8Array with the base58check.encode and the ECKey constuctor but both still return errors. I know about makeRandom() I am generating the keys myself so that is useless.

I don't mind as long as it's not simply "bit" or some other term that is already heavily used in computing. 
Can't we just use roman numerals to signify how much we've divided 0.1btc by, so: 
* Ibit = 0.1 btc
* Xbit = 0.01 btc
* Cbit = 0.001 btc
* Mbit = 0.0001 btc

This isn't a bad idea as a service. Fairly simple to implement if you know what you're doing. You'd have to pay for the sms's though from some service like dialog? (maybe it's not called that,it's been a few years since i used an sms api). You could always buy an sms gateway and do it yourself, though not sure how cheap you could do that. I know you can do it with super old cheap phones in some hacky way. If you're a developer and want me to explain it a bit better than send me a message, otherwise you're going to have to go with an existing service or learn a lot of stuff.

Well they have a 5 figure salary £67,000. And of course there are different tax bands so it's all relative.However, I think what you're missing is it's voters that elect them into that high salary and if they're not happy with the tax level they'll probably vote them out so the tax to them is redundant in the face of not getting that position and salary at all.

Eight long months after the beginning of the financial crisis my co-worker and friend Jiles came into my office and placed the dossier upon my desk. He placed both of his palms flat on the surface and looked down at me, "I think I've come up with the solution", he said. I remember pulling a faint sarcastic smile and exhaling quickly in a short chuckle. I didn't believe him of course, at least not at first, the entire thing was impossible. 
It had all started when we were handed a specific problem. 
*Oh and by "we" I mean the think tank that I work for, which I unfortunately cannot name, only a handful of people outside of it even know it exists, lets just call it think tank one or TT1 for simplicity.*
Anyway, we were handed a very difficult problem As you know, after the financial crisis, the US government and federal reserve had been forced to massively increase the US dollar supply. This was done in an attempt to stimulate lending following the credit crunch and to hopefully lesson the blow coming. It would hopefully keep the US and the World out of recession. However, what everyone involved knew was that increasing the money supply was only a short term solution. It had no hope of succeeding in the long run. However, it would almost literally buy time. Our task, and the bane of those previous eight months of my existence, was to figure out the long term solution. We had to work out how to counteract the inevitable inflation and decrease in the dollars value that would take place once the banks relaxed and began using all of this new money to create new credit. 
Many ideas had been suggested but in reality everyone at TT1 knew that the only hope was for the government to leverage out of the dollar into something else, something that could be bought now for a fraction of its eventual dollar value. The problem seemed impossible almost ridiculous to me, until that dossier was placed upon my desk. Within a few short months though we had intelligence experts from the CIA and MI5/6 working along side us, planning the birth of what would come to be called Bitcoin, the name being my only real contribution to the project. Fictitious identities were created and everything was scrutinized over and over again to tedium. Finally we were ready to release to the world our creation. 
Jiles had always been fascinated with Japanese culture, he created an obscure name, I believe he combined two from the old war documents we still had from calculating the lasting psychological impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Anyway, it couldn't be connected with us so the intelligence consultants agreed to it and from that day Jiles, a shy but gifted mathematician was forever know to the world as Satoshi Nakamoto. 
I do not expect you to believe me. I am lying here with just a few days to live, or so the doctors tell me. I do not wish to put anyone's life in jeopardy and you should know that even Jiles was not his real name to begin with in probability, that's the problem with working in secret organisations, you never know what's truly real. However, I need to tell the truth about what was done. The entire world needs to know what is planned if there is to be any real change.

Surely any rules regarding expression is censorship though? And I'm not really sure what the point of saying someone has a theory about a conspiracy is in terms of using it as a criticism. You have to base your arguments in evidence. If you don't believe that there is a conspiracy, which is a view I share, then you also have to give reasons why you think there isn't one. Just saying "they are a conspiracy theorist" is an ad hominem fallacy. So even though I agree with your conclusion your argument is irrational.

for(i = 0; i &lt; 1476; i++){
	start *= 1.002096268037;
which gives 5498.958792463683 Which is the price in pounds sterling at the time of writing.

I'm not a mathematician just a programmer. One thing I did spend some time on though was calculating the average daily percentage increase in price since I first bought bitcoin at £250 back in 2013 (please note after brexit gbp to usd has changed quite a lot) but what I got out of that was the daily increase is ~0.021% which is pretty damn good in my opinion.  Anyway if we take that figure and run it through this javascript program 
var start = 7500;
for(i = 0; i &lt; 730; i++){
	start *= 1.0021;
(you can do this by pressing f12 in chrome and pasting it there and pressing enter we get) a price of 34684 after 730 days which is 2 years.
Im not saying this average daily rate will hold or anything but if you ask a question like you did then that about as good as an answer I can give with my limited knowledge.
Oh also I started at $7500 just for a nice round number
EDIT: average daily percentage increase

This is very interesting to me. Im not entirely sure what a trend is but I was trying to calculate based on compound interest which to me seems like something that would be most useful in finance considering that loans are based upon this. 
I don't imagine investment decisions follow very exact natural laws but to me it seems that compound interest creates an artificial law that may be of interest. Perhaps when I take smaller fractions of time between dates from my buy in until now there will be more interesting averages such that lead to functions I cant model due to my lack of knowledge right now

“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”

I disagree that Europe is ahead of the US as a police state. Anyone who has been through a customs/x-ray at a US airport and traveled freely around Europe also will know this.
Not complying with laws is basically just calling for revolution, which is fine, but you're not really saying anything anyone who is intelligent enough to realize it will not have already realized, so it's a fairly pointless thing to say really. If you have a suggestion on how people can organize better and help others feel less intimidated in order that they might stop following laws then share that please, but simply swearing and saying laws work because not enough people are breaking them is just silly.
Finally please don't be aggressive. I think we both disapprove of the current system and think it's abhorrent, but letting that emotion effect how you express your opinions just makes your opinions sound irrational, which harms the cause a lot.

Yeh it's pretty bad here. It's pretty bad everywhere though. My argument is anecdotal anyway and so is yours. There's more to a police state that air port security or CCTV. 
I wouldn't like to seriously try and quantify a police state anyway. Lets just say the US, Britain and the rest of Europe have a bloody deeply engraved tick in the police state column now. Pencils were broken passionately scratching that tick into that column.

Do not generate wallets with a machine that has been connected to the internet. Download the wallet generation site and put it on a pen drive and then use a machine that has never been on the net.
You can also install Ubuntu temporarily from a boot disk if you don't want to buy a new machine, although this isn't quite as safe it is definitely better than using your every day OS installation.

Did you loose a lot of money or something mate? I'm looking at your previous posts and you seem really angry. If you genuinely want to help make things better you can look up local charities that need volunteers. Making silly angry statements on the internet doesn't really effect anything.

There are always the same number of people buying and selling. You can't buy something without someone else selling it to you and vise versa.

You can see the PUBLIC addresses but not the private keys used to generate the addresses. The Private key is the locker number. It doesn't "unlock" anything though. If you had some sci-fi computer you could loop through every number stealing any which have bitcoins in them. Here is a video explaining this 
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:17:06
This is wrong. A better analogy would be to say that the lockers don't have locks but that there are so many of them that correctly guessing which locker has money in it is so unlikely as to never happen.

The only thing you may have to pay is capital gains tax. You'll have to look up whether or not you made enough money to actually pay it and whether it's included for bitcoin. From what I remember HMRC havn't really decided what they are going to do with it yet. They basically said it depends how you made it and that it's so speculative that they may just treat it as gambling winnings which are not taxed. I wouldn't worry too much though, you might have to if labour get in as the conservatives have been very pro-bitcoin so far. Maybe just put 20% aside in case you do end up having to pay taxes. That way you'll be fine either way.
Edit: HMRC will tell you how to pay if you need to :P

Yes, the private key is all you need.

That's a higher percentage than were in my Computer Science degree which was around 2%. Perhaps when women are as interested in computers as much as men typically are then that 6% will increase.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:58:03
Ah ok thanks. So there's nothing explicitly asking you to declare bitcoin. It just comes under capitol gains and there's nowhere it actual states the word "bitcoin" on the tax return docs?

There is one single '500' error. '500' is the error code not the number of errors. You should contact bitpay as this will almost certainly be a problem with their web server.

How much would you need to start a bank that is part of the fractional reserve system and be able to give out more in loans than you have in deposits, effectively printing money, then? I hope you're not confusing this with trying to start a central bank, there are two ways banks create ("print") money you know.
EDIT: also why would it need to give out loans? It just needs to take deposits and handle transactions. So I guess how much would I need to get access to swift or visa or whatever then? You're right that is about it and that's all we need!

Again? How strange. Besides, more regulation is good for the price. The easier it is to go to prison for using Bitcoin the more informed people will end up inside educating "real" criminals about the dark web and bitcoin, increasing adoption.

Instead of doing that could you please just dump it in a forest somewhere. It will help many many species thrive. These days a lot of wood is removed from forests after falling, this is unnatural and causes many species which rely on dead wood to struggle. Also who the hell goes camping and takes firewood with them? You go camping and gather the wood yourself, it's fun, don't be a weirdo :P

I think you're being trolled but back to what you originally said. I agree that this isn't Orwellian, I don't recall any parallels between any events in 1984, or his other works, and a private company wanting to protect its image.
It is bad though and its obvious that they meant it's draconian and a misuse of power when saying it's Orwellian.

I don't think it's very smart to take a couple of anecdotes and apply them to a whole set of people.
I think the best argument you might make is that most pedophiles are on the left. But that doesn't mean anything because most people arn't pedophiles.
EDIT: It's the same as saying most racists are on the right. It's not the same as saying most right people are racist.
