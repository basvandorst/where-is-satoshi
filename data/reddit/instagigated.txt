Thanks for the tip!

How do I do this?
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:35:55
Tried this and it didn't work. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:21:19
Yes. Bitcoin was bought a-plenty today.

Thanks for the advice! I've got a Taobao account but my Chinese is the worst so I　may have trouble with that.

You answered your own question.

I had a feeling I should have bought when it dipped to $600. But I was patiently waiting for a drop to $500. I bought at $1000, then $800 and I didn't get paid until yesterday :(

I feel your feels.

Not sure what y'all were worried about. Even if this news was true, only third party sites were banned in China. Which meant that anyone using their bank accounts to fund cash to BTCChina were still able to do so. It wasn't much of a shocker.
Anyhow, I bought some cheap coin

I'm legitimately waiting for BitCoin to burst another bubble and crash again to buy. It really is *too* expensive for me to throw some cash in for just *one* BitCoin. I know I should have invested when BitCoins were worth cents and I was all into Silk Road, but hindsight is 20/20.

Sorry, I don't understand.

As Bitcoin is further exposed to the public and as it makes money, the guys in power will also want to make money off of it without doing anything. Obama may very well sign it under the guise of "helping the American economy." There was a thought in my mind along the lines of "grey area" and "who owns the Internet?"
What I think is that as Bitcoin is further accepted, AND because it is taxed, that it will be well, an alternative currency like PayPal is to many online retailers. This will only drive further people into Bitcoin. 
Now, is this a tax that is added onto already existing taxes? If so, consumers and merchants may not want to use Bitcoin; and that can harm the overall community.

Sorry, most of my knowledge on Bitcoin is from the old days or from this subreddit. I don't really hear much about BTC in China.

Or you just need to have disposable cash for which you do not care if it loses value. That's my situation. I'm living comfortably at the moment (not rich) and can throw $1000-2000 into Bitcoin and not be worried about crashes in price. If it rises, great! 
For anyone who is still thinking of jumping onto the bandwagon; wait for another dip in price; buy in with money you can see disappearing and not care about. If you can't do that last part, don't invest.

It's not *just* India. Corruption happens all over the world. Some countries and their governments are really bad at hiding it.

Man, that is rad. Congrats on getting your wallet. Maybe one day I'll find my old data and get my very few coins, haha. Ignore the haters and beggars :)
