Bought at 615 sold at 1000
Bought back at 715 sold at 1000
Bought back at 515 sold at 1000
Bought LTC at 20 sold at 30 just for fun
The world has moved on, and so has my bank balance.

This time next week we'll probably all be sat in the bar discussing the great bitcoin crash. It's amazing how fast this bubble is burning through!
I for one am going to hold until the eventual conclusion, trading a little between BTC and LTC just for the fun of it. I can afford to lose what I've put in. If I lost it all, I'd consider it a risk worth taking in case it really did become something else. Once I accepted I don't mind if I lose it all, I'm very calm about it.
Also, when it does crash how are you guys going to exit? Plan your exit strategy now, because once panic sets in I can see the exit routes closing very fast (either through lucks of funds or DDOS). Remember all the people who have joined in the past few weeks will all want to leave at the same time - that's never going to end well.

It astounds me they think such comments are appropriate give the amount of money at stake. Telling people not to 'freak out' is an excellent way to cause people to freak out. Tell us what's going on and give us the facts and information we need, and let us decide whether to freak out or not!

The other scenario is the exchanges crash before real panic sets in, therefore avoiding a crash altogether. We may have avoided a crash already because if this effect and not noticed it.

Yes that's a common argument. However the barriers for a user to move from one social network site to another are very low, so it can happen very quickly once momentum builds up (e.g their friends start moving). During the transition they can maintain a presence on both sites.
With bitcoin it's people's money, and that presents a much greater barrier to get people to move from one implementation to another. You can't have your money in two places at once. A transition is far less practical to people who already posses any quanitiy bitcoin.
There's a statistic I often hear in the UK that people are more like to get divorced than change their bank account during their lifetime.
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:14:08
Perhaps I was being a little flippant.
I believe bitcoin will become an underlying trust providing protocol used to back other faster transactions in technologies layered on top of bitcoin.
After all it's a long time since gold itself was used as currency. Its laborious to carry around gold and transact with it. It's even harder to split into smaller units. Hence gold backed currencies became common place, and as long as you knew at any time you could exchange your currency for gold at a central bank you were fine with it.
I believe, if bitcoin is successful, then other new faster transactions technologies will be built, backed by Bitcoin. In this scenario, bitcoins delay in confirming transactions isn't a big deal, as the confidence given by the confirmation process is more important.
Perhaps all bitcoin owners will become a sort of distributed central bank. And this is why I'm bullish on its value, as well as the value of bitcoin based technology startups.
Man, I really love writing about bitcoin!

There is one thing that concerns me...
A few people will have lost a lot of money over the past few hours by panic selling at a loss. Even if the price recovers, these people will not get their money back. And they will be vocal about how bitcoin ruined their lives. Very vocal. We will see their rants on reddit. We will see their stories in the press.
Now more then ever it is vital that long term bitcoiners stick to the fundamental arguments and avoid getting sucked into to arguments with those who lost money speculating. Losing money in a speculative bubble and the long term viability of bitcoin should not one and the same, but bad PR is bad PR and will be very damaging if not handled appropriately.

One developer is more than enough for a project like this. Go find yourself a talented graphic designer with experience creating user inferences for mobile apps. Design a good looking app that provides an excellent user experience. Spend some time understanding how people will actually want to use this information in a mobile app and try and solve some real end user needs.
On my iPhone I can easily visit a website and view stock information. What would this app provide that simply going to a mobile website provide? If you can answer that, then I'd consider investing.

Hah, if the argument for bitcoin is 'hey, it's still faster than cheques' we should all turn the lights off and go home.

I'm not sure. In a vertical drop your orders may get executed well below the point you set them at. Also you don't want to get 'shaken out' where the price drops just below your sell, then rallies again - that's the worst feeling ever.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:41:53
What Bitcoin really needs is merchants willing to trade with each other for Bitcoin, without converting to USD at each step.
A not-for-profit organisation needs to exist that will promote this to merchants and help make introductions among bitcoin accepting businesses. Such an organisation should provide material explaining why merchants would want to do this (there has to be a good reason, other than idealogical beliefs) if mass adoption is going to take place.
The Bitcoin Foundation has started this process, but I think they need to focus more on the supply chain side of things, encouraging more B2B Bitcoin transactions, as well as promoting Bitcoin accepting consumer businesses.

It does indeed, and it sucks. But unless we take it seriously online wallets will still keep on getting hacked. There's no easy answer I'm afraid, it's a problem that will only get considerably worse as the value of Bitcoin increases.

Forget about the magnetic strip, it's the chip on the card that is used these days.
How about the ability to load a portion of BTC onto a card, in the same manner as those BTC physical coins you can buy. I would be interested if anyone can answer these questions regarding this idea:
1. Would this pre-paid BTC card require the private key of the wallet if was loaded from (non-starter of it is!)
2. Can the BTC loaded onto the card be paid bit by bit (again, a requirement)
If this is possible, you can hash the whole thing with a pin code for validation, after which point it could be used in exactly the same way as a modern chip and pin card. IMO something like this is needed to lead to mass adoption by consumer and retailer.

This is exactly the same in real life mining. When the price of a commodity goes up, mines which are more expensive to operate are opened. (perhaps due to remote location, or lower ore yeilds). Fracking for natural gas is also more expensive than gas from walls, but as soon as the price of gas made it profitable, we saw an explosion in new Fracking operations. So if the BTC price goes so high EC2 mining becomes profitable, expect all of EC2's GPU instances to be roped into mining overnight - until EC2 put the price up. Supply and demand, you see. Ahhh, economics :D
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:00:01
I think what you've done is a valuable exercise. If you can determine what the actual cost of mining on EC2 is now, then know at what BTC price this becomes profitable, you are in a position to take advantage of this when that price is reached. Even better if you have instances images ready to launch as soon as a profitable price is reached.
Even better to script it so you automatically mine only if it's profitable :D

That's easy. Don't use them. But lots of users, especially those new to bitcoin or actively trading them, have no choice. Yes it would be great if everyone stores their bitcoin in paper wallets, but that's never going to be practical in a world where people actually want to use their bitcoin as easily as possible.
Bitcoin needs services sat on top of the infrastructure if it's going to be successful. It will fail without such services, and it will fail if these services fail at security.
I'm happy to pay a fee when using an exchange because I know there are costs involved, and people should be happy to pay a fee when using other wallet services to cover those costs as well.

Ouch, I'm getting a lot of hate on this thread. 
I bought a lot bitcoin in March as an investment at $80. To my astonishment it went up to well over $200, then all the way back down to $80. I kicked myself for not selling at $200 as I was only looking to make some money. So I forgot about it and waiting for it come back around, and then sold at the target I always had in mind - $200. Took the money, thanks very much.
I'm not a bitcoin evangelist. I'm a speculator, and I did alright (eventually).
If it takes a big dive, sure ill buy back in. Otherwise I'll take the cash. Either way I'm happy. I'm not going to cry if it goes to $1000 or whatever. I took a healthy profit. I'm not chasing losses.
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:06:27
I think the confusion is down to long term being 10 years, but on long term is 10 days.

This is just the market venting some pressure after these huge gains. To be honest I'm glad it's happening now. If it recovers, it will demonstrate resilience in the market and give confidence to future buyers and current holders that they don't need to panic sell, reduce the chances of a crash in the future.

It is a MySql error. All you guys who had your bitcoin stored in someone else's MySql database are gonna have a bad time.
This is the problem with most Bitcoin services, they all seem a bit slapdash. I mean have the sites look like they've been thrown together with Bootstrap and less than a day.
Don't get me wrong, these tools are fine for almost everything. But this is your money we're talking about. The fact that database errors are getting bubbled up and displayed to end users is extremely worrying!
I have ZERO confidence in any third party wallet service. The entire bitcoin industry need some investment in order to improve and professionalise its services.

I failed to sell when it went over $200 last time so I sat on it since then. Told myself I'd sell next time it it hit that price. I've taken a nice profit. If I buy back in, great. Otherwise, I've made a load of money and should be happy with that :D

Crikey really? I did not know this!
Well, just like some 3rd world countries that skipped landline telephone networks and went straight to 3G mobile technology, the US should 'jump' chip-and-pin technology and move straight to BTC chip cards. This is the future.
Also, still using mag strips?? Wow! How do you guys auth a transaction? With a signature alone? Do you still have those devices that 'scan' a card onto triplicate paper? No wonder you are all buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:58:46


I think one reason BTC is staying so high is that it's not so easy to convert to fiat cash at the moment. If WU introduced a really simple way to cash out, we could see a short term price dip as those who want to exit do so. I do see this as a good thing in the long term as it provides a simple way for cash to flow back in to BTC, however I do see it impacting the dynamics of the market in some way or another so would remain wary.

I like to think of the crash as a large Earthquake. The built up energy (the rapid price rise) was released in a violent shock movement (the flash crash). Now the main quake is over, expect many aftershocks as the market (the 'continental plates') shift about trying to find a comfortably equilibrium as the remainder of the energy is released. Only then can normal service continue, and ultimately the potential for another bubble to form as the energy increases once more. 
But when? Just like an Earthquake, it's not easy to predict just when the release will happen, however we can see from charts just how much energy is built up in the system waiting to be unleashed. What we can't predict is the trigger. With enough pent-up energy, perhaps all it takes is a butterflys wings.

If it really is possible to embed arbitrary information in the blockchain then this will be abused and will cause problems for Bitcoin. 
Needless to mention the Blockchain is already getting far to big without it being spammed up with junk.
Bitcoins clients should be updated to discard unwanted additional data not pertinent to Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:04:05
Couldn't agree more. The Baidu news isn't a game changer IMO. The fundamentals haven't changed. I'll be keeping on an eye on the Chinese press for bitcoin references though. If the recent price rises gets high profile news coverage then a much bigger could form and I agree it would be worth play-trading with, but nothing I'd be sorry to see lost. It's impossible to call the peak, and it will certainly come back down well below today's prices before finding a new floor.
All I know is exponential growth never ends well in the short term.
