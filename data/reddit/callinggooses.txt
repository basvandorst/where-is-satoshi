I don’t care what researchers use. I was born in 84. Millennials should be for people born within 10 years of the turn of the millennia. Not 2 decades. So you can affiliate yourself with that group but I refuse to and will never call myself a millennial. Ever.

35 year olds are not millennials.

Hope this helps.

When the time comes to sell... you won’t have to. You will just start transacting in bitcoin.

Some would argue that the dollar is backed by the GDP. Not my words.

No I don’t see what’s happening here because the price of BTC doesn’t correlate with stupid ass coincidences.
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:50:52
I hope not.

Pretty sure you can handle all of your banking with USAA through their mobile app.

You’ve been reported for being a miserable human being that nobody probably wants to ever be around.

I think you’re high. Governments can’t continuously print bitcoin like they do with fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-12-07 03:22:54
Good. I need to buy more.

Governments would rather have control over monetary and fiscal policies so they can better control people.
