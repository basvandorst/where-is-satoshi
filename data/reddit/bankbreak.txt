I don't deny they have helped, but they didn't create bitcoin, they don't own bitcoin, and they don't get to decide what is and isnt bitcoin.
Segwit is a departure from bitcoin's original vision. Bitcoin cash is more in line with bitcoin's white paper. These are facts. The core developers wanted to rewrite the white paper to hide this fact.
The creators of bitcoin cash are no more riding the coattails then core is. Core did good work, but they are also taking someone else's idea and riding on its merits.

Ad hominem and Strawman. Back to back. Good job.
I'm not arguing from authority, how on earth did you get that idea? I am making the assertion that the white paper describes Bitcoin. Isnt that a radical idea? Do you agree that the white paper describes Bitcoin? 
I am also making the assertion that bitcoin cash follows that white paper. Do you disagree?
So if Bitcoin Cash (not BCash) follows the white paper, and the white paper describes bitcoin, then it follows that Bitcoin Cash has just as much right to the name Bitcoin as SegwitCoin (see I can use insults to further my argument too).
Comparing us to racists huh? Why not go all the way and compare us to Hitler? Go big or go home is what I always say.

Per the white paper, there is no block size limit. Code was added to prevent spam as a temporary measure. This code was designed to be removed and it is about time.
I have no concern for unupgraded nodes rejecting blocks as the network will ignore them. 


Upgrades do that. Most clients are expecting this upgrade and already running the upgraded code, the others will figure it out soon enough.


We are all awed with your ability to insult people instead of debating them. You know exactly what I am talking about and are well aware the white paper makes no mention of a block size. 
If I'm mistaken and you are not aware of this then I recommend you do a little research and read it before making yourself look foolish in public

No. Satoshi, Gavin, Jeff, and a few other early developers did the work to make bitcoin the way it was. They were doing this while Cores main contributor was proving bitcoin could never work.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:01:00






You admit the white paper has no block limit and you call B2X an alt coin. Hmm. As long as B2X has the majority of hash power it is Bitcoin. Core doesnt get to decide what is Bitcoin, the white paper does. The most worked chain that follows Bitcoins consensus rules. 2x had 85% of the hash power and you trolls have the audacity to call it an alt coin. Lol

ASCII boost wasnt known about at the time of the split so that is irrelevant to the discussion of the split communities.
Core has promised to do a block size increase but never actually intended to. 2 years later and nothing. We try to do our own increase and threw in segwit and Core is screaming about how the sky will fall. Don't tell me that Core always intended this because that is bullshit.

@_date: 2017-08-27 18:57:41
Bitcoin does not have a block limit. This limit was not in the original design and thus can be discarded at will. Compatibility with clients is irrelevant as we have made many changes that broke from earlier clients. This is no different
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:14:07
Big blocks is how bitcoin was designed. They allow anyone to use the network without permission. LN requires asking node operators to pass a transaction along and hope the fee isnt too high. How is that decentralized exactly? How will LN help break up the centralization of mining? Because if you cannot decentralize mining then having a large number of nodes does not matter. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:48:45


SPV works pretty good, we also could write code for a partial node, one that picks blocks at random to check and verifies the random picks as well as the ones important to the user. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:35:31


No SPV requires I trust that one of the nodes I connect to has the longest chain. I'm not worried about miners increasing the block size limit. That would be nice of them to do. SPV could easily check for that though.


Mining a new a block is expensive. If they were to mine a new chain and change something like inflation they would still need to do more POW then the main chain to fool my SPV client. This is unlikely.


Of course I can. Grab a list of block hashes and choose one at random. Verify the hash matches, make sure the parents hash matches the hash in the list, check to see inflation, block size and the rest. This would be easy to code.

@_date: 2017-09-03 23:08:28
Users cannot use the main chain if you make it too expensive to do so. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be a P2P currency. Bitcoin.org still lists it as such. By choking the main chain and forcing users off chain you are making it a permissioned system that requires middlemen to transact. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:48:07


No, we don't. We can safely increase it now, and do a lot more then 2megs. Look at how often etherium safely forks and ask yourself if hard forks are dangerous.


Second layer solutions will take a load off of the main chain and reduce costs, this is true. Future demand, however, will increase costs more then any reduction that LN offers.
LN or other second layer solutions cannot make the main chain faster. 10m block times are not going to be changed by second layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:07:57
Keeping bitcoin P2P.
Introducing middlemen changes Bitcoin into something else.
P2P is permissionless. If you can control the major Bitcoin LN hubs, you can censor transactions and charge whatever fees you like.
LN also does not work with small blocks. LN requires that the closing transaction happens within a specific time window. If the transaction fails to go through within the window due to sudden congestion then you are exposed to double spends.

First off 2 megs is not enough for segwit (edit: I mean LN). It is closer to 1 gigabyte. Wow, oh no 1 gig? Yup
In order to use the lightning network you must first fund it using a bitcoin transaction and then create a refund transaction. 2 transactions. 
Now 1 meg allows approximately 300k transactions at the moment. Segwit puts that to about 500 and since we need 2 transactions to fund a hub that means 250k people can enter the network per day with 1 meg. 
Most people live paycheck to paycheck so we need to assume that they will need to fund their lightning hub once a month. That means 1 meg allows 7.5 million users out of 7 billion people.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:34:56
Yes we do really. You still need to transact on the main chain in order to fund the lightning network. With 1 meg blocks you would be waiting multiple years in line for your lightning hub to get funded with worldwide adoption. 
You really need to talk with people outside this forum. 1 meg does not make any sense from a technical standpoint.

Holding it isnt using it. If I kept a basketball in my closet, you wouldn't call that using it would you?
Bitcoin is designed to bring finance to the masses. Using it to store value isnt very disruptive. Using it for commerce is. Bitcoin works great for commerce. 
I use it at least once a week. Most people who are against block size increases don't use it. Its kinda hard to have a good idea on how to improve something if you aren't using it. 
Imagine if I bought a bunch of shares of Google but never used the search engine, and then went to board meetings and started telling everyone how it should be changed and how it should work. I think users of Google would know better then I what does and does not work in that hypothetical example, wouldn't you?

You don't ask people what they think? I find thats the best way to learn what people believe.
When did I say I find short term price increase to be important? I think usage is most important. The ability to adopt new users.
I'm not certain how segwit makes bitcoin more decentralized. It seems to me that it would make it less decentralized. People are claiming that they cannot run nodes on their home computer if the amount of data in the blocks go up. Well segwit increases this amount by up to 4 megs. I wonder if those users plan on ignoring the witness data. 
If we can handle segwit then why can't we handle a 4 meg block increase? None if these arguememts makes any sense
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:25:43
You keep using character attacks. It doesnt help your arguments at all and only makes you sound childish. I don't seem bright really? There is no reason to attack my intellegence.
As far as their holdings I do not have access to their accounting sheets. I have heard it mentioned in debates that they do not hold bitcoin and it wasn't contested by them. So I will concede I don't know this for certain

If I were invited to a debate about colonizing mars I would decline as I do not understand the technical hurdles. I am totally if favor of colonizing mars but have no business in such a debate.

@_date: 2017-07-06 21:21:20
It is very relevant. Do you want to ask me why not PayPal? it would be easy to answer. 
First off setting up PayPal requires a bank and AML restrictions. This is cost prohibative for third world countries (see Tealet). They charge me a percentage to use and sometimes censor transactions. Everything I do on PayPal is tracked and sold to third parties. 
PayPal requires large amount of website security to setup. It is difficult to code AI engines that accept PayPal. 
Bitcoin is incredibly disruptive when used as commerce. It is mildly disruptive when used as a store of value.
Holders are usually using bitcoin instead of a bank because they expect the value to go up, but it only will go up if it is useful as currency.

Satoshi's plan was absolutely in favor of removing the block size limit. Here is a quote.
Also everyone, I think, would prefer mining to be done by individual users. The problem is that we cannot prevent mining farms with POW. So Satoshi was aware that mining farms were inevitable and wrote the design of Bitcoin to minimize the harm in mining farms.

If the traffic is encrypted it cannot be identified. Torrents or bitcoins cannot be identified. The argument is: they would identify it by the size of the data, but this could easily be circumvented. 
If MPAA could stop torrents they would. Legitimate uses or not, they would stop it. They have a lot of influence too. The fact is the government cannot stop it.
