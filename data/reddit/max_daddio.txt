This has been the case since Bitcoin started. I wonder how long it will take people to realise. 5 more years? 10?

Fair enough, I feel like I latched onto some words there like "guessing" future price and got carried away with my rant.

There is no trading algorithm in the world that will correctly predict Bitcoin price or even a trend based on historical performance. At best it will be a complete fluke if it does get something right. Anyone who tells you any differently (they have a "trading algorithm that works!") is a charlatan and a snake oil salesman. The industry has tried with equities, derivatives and all kinds of tradeable assets. Maybe one day we will find the magic algorithm. But not yet. Any trend you think you see is almost guaranteed to perform no better than a random selection of buy/sell orders and if not, you are just extremely lucky and cannot attribute any success to the "algorithm". 
In markets, the past is almost no indication of what will happen in the future. The best algorithms to date make use of crowd sourced "sentiment analysis" and are able to tell when the overall feeling towards an asset is "net positive" or "net negative". This gives you a \*reasonably\* reliable indicator of overall sentiment, but still there is no way to guess any future price.
Sorry, but I just get slightly triggered whenever someone talks about a trading algorithm that can guess future prices.

Why have I seen so many people calling it Honk Kong lately? Do you know that it's HonG Kong?

lol. Tell that to the people who went all-in in December 2017. You most definitely can "go wrong" with Bitcoin.

Do you know how much money Bitfinex and Binance and the like make currently? A metric fuck ton of money per day in trades (in the order of millions of dollars per day). I don't have the numbers but I don't believe they'll be going out of business soon. They've already made enough money to run those exchanges for several years/decades.

That is for investors, not for a business, which is taxed on business expenses/losses just like any other, I imagine.
