Love the thinking.

So there is no need to be concerned about BCH or the Segwit2x miner hard fork posing a threat to Bitcoin's value proposition, insofar as neither proposes a compelling, sustainable point of differentiation.

I would assume the opposite; I, for one, wouldn't value a surviving 2mb chain produced by such circumstances *at all.* Such an outcome would be tantamount to the destruction of the value proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value, which would extend to any other chain attempting to act as a store of value.

Because I really believe it.

Goal here was to package a curated set of introductory, social proof, and negative mainstream media rebuttal resources in a “early majority” friendly UX.
The content included thus far is merely a starting point to solicit your feedback on the overall approach. There’s plenty of work to do to improve the curation. For instance, Andreas’ talks are featured heavily. Ideally, in order to be more persuasive, it’s arguably best to feature as many different sources as possible. There’s also work to do to add descriptive captions to each resource (articles and videos particularly) to provide the reader a more detailed understanding of each upfront. Ultimately, each subtopic should feature a “summary” or “highlights” section at the top of the page, with the resources serving more as supporting citations than as primary content.
If this seems helpful to you in proselytizing others, I’d be happy to keep working on it. If not, that’s fine too.
