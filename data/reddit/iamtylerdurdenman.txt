Warren Buffet's message was interesting and yet people bashed him. Some random self-proclaimed CEO of an unknown marketing start-up writes a letter to someone praising Bitcoin, it makes headlines. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:15:45
Warren Buffet does not posses the title Sir and just because he gave his two cents does not mean absolutely shit for this currency
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:41:25
Yeah whatever floats your boat. You people are an embarrasment
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:20:05
What makes you think he hasn't studied and researched this matter? What a fucking clown
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:45:26
To me you seem like an extreme clown
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:07:36
Yeah sure. A man who has been in a market forever and is a billionaire does not understand bitcoin. Stop the idiocy you clown
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:54:15
Yeah you better have a plan B. Your whole approach is pathetic. You seem to have no basic ideas about how the government functions. Just because you support gay rights doesn't give you the qualification for a chair son
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:36:19
Nah I don't really care
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:47:24
Better than seeing my money sink
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:20:57
How do you define important from not important then genius?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:16:31
Or maybe they have more important shit to take care off than a non existing currency
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:32:36
Think what you want. I know this is reddit but it would help investors like me more if I knew everything and not sugar coated unimportant letters from unknown start up CEO's who have no power over anything regarding my investment. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:31:58
My definition of crap is an idiot like you who has no idea of the basic finance and simply jumps into every bandwagon there is. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:42:35
Yeah most definitely.....dumbass
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:18:33
Congrats. You are an idiot
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:31:35
"If China bans bitcoin, then prices go down and more people in the US will buy"
Go learn finance idiot. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:36:08
If it's blindly pro, then it's gonna be you the one having a bad time
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:04:05
Yeah the freedom card shuts down everything doesn't it
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:45:07
Are you 5? I am not picking a fight here. Maybe I don't understand quite well the logic of this subreddit
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:30:07
Typical idiot bitcoin-er
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:20:05
What makes you think he hasn't researched it? Or had people to research it for him? Do you know the guy personally? You are not a special snowflake because you understand how it works. The sources are there and they can be learned. Idiot
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:19:13
Oh yeah? Well you are certainly not the first mistake people make when voting
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:52:14
"I think within 12 months we will have bitcoin as easy to do on Facebook as adding an emoticon or a freaking sticker" you are the reason this subreddit is looked as a joke
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:18:11
I know right? I can't believe he is missing out on this non existent currency and focusing instead on his dollars. What a dumbass
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:55:02
Seems to me like you are creating the drama over an obvious thing
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:52:11
There is nothing philosophical about this post. It's just a trolling platform
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:15:13
Contact the authorities. You were scammed
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:40:10
Thanks for intelligent response. I was just wondering about the reason of why the core of the subreddit is built like this. I personally don't find it helpful
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:46:18
He doesn't know finance? You must be a moron
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:11:33
Because posts like this, people hate this subreddit
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:43:51
How many people are going to lose money until then though? Banks are at least protected by police. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:28:52
Bitcoin is an illusion. It will bite you in the ass soon
