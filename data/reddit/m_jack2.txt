I just love how awful the translation in Arabic "بيتكوين" which read it in "Bitkouine", 
There is many beautiful names for Bitcoin in Arabic, but please no more بيتكوين or the "Biiiitkouuuuiiiine"

Maybe like the fees of routing the transaction? A lightning node can propose small fee and sometimes negative fee.  if he have bitcoin and litecoin in the network can propose both, fee of routing and his price of exchanging.

The most dangerous bubble is a bubble that no one expect it as a bubble. All the bubble crisis that popped was inflated by fiat bubble. If they have a choice between pop the economy bubble or fiat bubble. They will pop the economy bubble. Because the fiat bubble is too big to be popped.
I have a quantum gate that can copy any objet. I will copypasta fiat money until the gouvernement raise the tax rate to 100%, 200% 1000%. So there have only two choice, pop the economy bubble or pop the fiat bubble.
So Fiat bubble is just a bubble.

When dollar and fiat currency worth nothing and central banks are dead, bitcoin will be traded only for gold coin. Its the mariage between virtual gold and physical gold. (And litecoin for silver), and the price will go up to 2.100 coin gold per bitcoin (4.25g 23mm gold coin), its where 21 million bitcoin supply reach 187 tonne gold supply.

I think it will reach a point, when its the dollar who will lose value just like the Zimbabwe dollar; hyperinflation. 
The point of the gold market cap of 180,000 tonnes? Maybe?

Its possible that bitcoin price go to 1 quintillion dollar.  If it does, it just mean that the dollar has crashed into hyperinflation. And will soon seas to exist. And no you cant buy 1 quintillion big mac at that price.

Even if you lost all your bitcoin, the economy is safe. And you can recover with the crypto-economy growth.
But its not the case with the centralized banks. They take your money without you noticing with fractional reserve and inflation, and harm the entire economy. So there is no room to recover your intrinsic value stolen by the banks.

I just forgot to mention in my comment that the comparaison I made, was between an economy rolling fully in crypto, and our economy now in fiat.
Yes, now almost all bitcoin user just hodl their coins. Because their strategy is quite simple : hodl until it goes mainstream.
We see many holders for just the sake of big fiat money return.  But people who see future in bitcoin dont hold it to make big money in FIAT, but to make big money in BITCOIN. They dont trust fiat. They dont want to spend they coins to fiat and then spend the fiat on goods. They want to spend it directly to the merchant where goods are valued in bitcoin, not in fiat converted to bitcoin. And this is were it goes mainstream.
When bitcoin goes mainstream and international, it will gain price stability in purchasing different goods, not purchasing fiat. Maybe at that time dollar will be in hyperinflation, like his  Zimbabwe friend. Caused by Central banks pumping out dollars to try bring back people to it.
About, the inconvenient you mentioned is not caused by bitcoin but by the hardware wallet. They are visible to the eyes and recognizable as a bitcoin wallet. If you want to hold your wealth in bitcoin, keep it from eyes. And if  im in a situation with 10,000 btc hardware wallet and i have a wife and childrens and someone pull a gun in me to steal my wealth. I will just kick his ass. and if he kills me. My wife will restore the bitcoin with the recovery key and ensure the future of our childrens and grand childrens
I think, the ultimate solution to this gun's problem, is to store your bitcoin in the brain. And make sure no one knows. And even if someone pull gun on you and torture you, with the fear of death, you will leak the focus to remember all the mnemonics. So, its the safest way possible to secure bitcoin from thief and from oneself in stressful moment.
