Interesting POV. But when handling small amounts of cash the cost shouldn't be a problem. Of course in case you are selling merchandise for 100k$ daily then electronic money is a way better option.

If the dip leads to a proper crash then there will be plenty to buy for cheap ;)

Thank you for your feedback:
- The values are cached from the APIs in the servers database and the regular API is limited. So I would have to limit the API calls to only a few selected coins/pairs or the requests would have to be made from multiple IPs or it would have to use websockets. Anyway the purpose of the site is just to check your portfolio a few times a day, this is really not meant for active traders.. 
- Yes, one of my friends did suggested it and I would definitely look into it. However I'm afraid it would 'spam' the clean (but still lame lol) design of the site.

From: 
USDT is a cryptocurrency asset issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer Protocol. Each USDT unit is backed by a U.S Dollar held in the reserves of the Tether Limited and can be redeemed through the Tether Platform. 
But yes I do remember reading some bad things about it lately.. but haven't really bothered, because I don't use any of those two platforms.

At Poloniex and Bittrex they have USDT where T stands for Tether. However that's all I know about it, not sure why is it used :)

Looks really nice, but the point of my site is different. It is a simple site where you can track your crypto portfolio from various platforms (currently supported: Bitstamp, Coinmarketcap, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Bittrex, GDAX) at one place. The site doesn't offers any fancy indicators, only the price. I wanted to have a simple surface where I can see the price of my coins eg. Bitstamp BTC/USD, Bitfinex IOTA/USD... Hopefully some of you will like it and find it useful as much as I do.
URL: 
- add/remove pairs
- drag&amp;drop to customize order ( currently works only on desktop )
- save the order under your desired username ( no registration/password needed, for example:  )
- first pair gets pushed into the site title ( so the tabs name will be always updated with the current price )
- updates automatically each minute
Please keep in mind that the site is still in alpha stage, so there can be plenty of bugs. I will be more than happy to read your feedbacks.
Thanks :)
