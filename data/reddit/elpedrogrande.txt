That's pretty much how I ended up here.  In fact, I had completely forgotten BTC existed until I saw an article about it on the front page.  I has heard about it years ago on Steve Gibson's Security-Now podcast.  (I considered mining after listening to that, If only...) Anyway, I saw the article and decided to subscribe.  Now I'm mildly obsessed.

The little tweezers are useful for *things* too.

My net worth is negative, but at least I diversified!  Underwater mortgage, student loans, credit cards...  Lol

This is the first I've heard of the exploit.  I wonder if they would've gotten away with it if they had attempted a more conspicuous amount.

I love it when random generosity is displayed on Reddit.

"Most of the best protocol features aren't implemented yet" Care to elaborate on this?  I am still new and am not quite sure which features you're referring to.

And even then, credit unions exist as a great alternative to banks.

That's pretty much my philosophy as well, however I also add "do not spend your winnings" into the equation.  So I walk into a casino with $40 or $60 and immediately pocket whatever I win. Very rarely do I leave empty handed.  (though it is usually less then what I walk in with).

This is brilliant.  You should consider creating a webstore for these.  Maybe the Mods could link you in the sidebar as well.

I am still relatively new, but for the few transactions I have completed, I have received a backup (from blockchain.info).  So it would appear that you are correct.

Wish I knew this 15 years ago.  I am still trying to dig out of Credit card and student loan debt.  My own fault for just signing the papers without doing the research.  It was an expensive, yet valuable lesson.
