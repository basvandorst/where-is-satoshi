Cant tell if op's been buying too many things off the dark-net, Hopeful of the price drop, or just being silly.

This is a pretty sweet idea! I would def' consider paying some freelancer's in bitcoin. I feel like there are many people that are interested in this. This is a sweet alternative to odesk for me :)

Done! :)
