I'm using Coinbase right now, it's good for quick, small purchases. You can't withdraw back to your bank in Canada though, so I tend to buy more ETH and LTC and then trade for BTC on different exchanges since it's expensive to transfer BTC. Quadrigacx seems to be the best bet for withdrawing money, and they also have options for buying BTC but I've not yet tried them - seems more involved, though better for higher volume purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:06:29
It's a fair point - at least right now, transferring BTC is very slow and fairly expensive. For a normal transfer in daily life, like $20, you really don't want to spend $5 on fees and still wait 3 hours for the transaction to complete.
However, the other coins tend to be faster and have lower fees, and BTC's moving in that direction too if Lightning works out. So might as well get on the bandwagon before crypto's perfect, and ride the wave as it improves.

It's not really comparable like that since 1 BTC or one share is an arbitrary value and any company or currency could have any number of shares or coins.
However, the current market cap of Bitcoin is 165 billion - this is the value of all the coins that have been mined, assuming they're all worth the current price. Apple has a market cap of 882 billion, Google (Alphabet) has a cap of 719 billion, and there are various others with higher caps than BTC. Comparable companies to BTC would be Cisco or IBM with caps of 184 billion and 142 billion respectively.
Note that a company's market cap includes various assets like real estate, hardware, and IP that Bitcoin doesn't really have though - so if BTC started selling its value would plummet faster than the shares of a company, and in a liquidation event it would be worth less than the market cap suggests.
Still pretty impressive though!

Nope - in order for your transaction to be added to the blockchain it must be part of a block that the miners are computing. Since only one block is mined every 10 minutes, there's a limit to how many transactions can be processed at a time - thus if you want your transaction to be processed, you need to add a transaction fee in order to make your transaction worth including in an upcoming block. Since BTC can process so few transactions at a time and it's very popular, fees are currently quite high, around $5 in many cases. Lightning network should improve this dramatically, but it's a ways away. Until then currencies with cheaper fees like LTC and ETH are preferable for frequent transactions.

Bots will actually help with stability and make crypto more useful as currency since they quickly balance out any small trends, and you don't want your money to be volatile. But yeah, I don't think BTC will realistically be useful as day to day currency, I'd think it'd be better for big things. For day to day stuff Ether might be a contender since it's not a fixed supply, but it's way too volatile for now. We need a lot more volume in crypto usage before anything's stable enough to be a real currency contender, except for money backed fiat like Tether.

It'll hit 15k sometime. Maybe not this year, but eventually - hold on and buy more when it gets cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:49:40
Yeah, down for me too. In Canada if that matters.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:20:48
Exactly. At some point everything's going to crash. Who knows when, who knows to what. But a lot of shitcoins are going to be wiped out, and even the established coins will lose value. But I'm willing to bet that the coins with good teams and good tech will survive and bounce back to even higher prices afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:47:21
Not as far as I can tell, looks pretty stable right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:17:24
Oh, it has tons of potential. But so do other cryptos. Now, BTC was first to market and has name recognition - a huge edge when it comes to adoption. But there's no telling if it'll ultimately be the best crypto. Myspace was killing it until Facebook came along. Yahoo was absolutely dominating the internet until Google popped up. You can't predict what'll win in the end.
I think BTC has plenty of room to grow, but there's a very real possibility that it'll take a hit and be replaced with something else. Don't count on being a millionaire in 20 years if you put money into BTC - you wouldn't do that for any company. Potentially earning a decent chunk of cash in a couple years? Much better odds.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:49:23
It would be a perfectly valid strategy, so I don't think it'd be reversed. If it was reversed a lot of people would get concerned over just how much control they actually have over their money - in the short term it'd fix that one sell-off, but all the other big holders would want to get away ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:11:27
Name value and adoption mostly. To most people Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency, and when big businesses start to accept crypto BTC will be the first they're willing to deal with in all likelihood. No guarantees that BTC will still be king in 10 years, but I'm optimistic about the next 5.
And that assumes no major tech changes - who knows where BTC development will take us in the future. As it gains more adoption there'll likely be more dev resources dedicated to improving it.

I'm planning to do this for a game I'm working on! I was involved in a game that almost used Doge for in game currency but that idea was scrapped, but I'd love to implement crypto in a game at some point. Sadly it's on the backburner right now as I need to make some cash before I'll have time to work on the game more, but I'm hoping to see other devs do this, and I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes common in a year or two.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:54:37
Did you use a direct bank transfer? It takes a while for that to go through the bank.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:14:56
Ultimately, this is why holding is the best strategy for most people. Cryptobots will beat out humans in high frequency, they already are. As the markets gain more liquidity bots will continue to become more dominant.
But no bot can predict the future long term - so just like with stocks, buying and holding will remain a very viable strategy. It's also the least time consuming and you're not racking up fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:12:45
AFAIK you only declare capital gains - ie. the amount you earn after converting to USD (or whatever government currency). So if it's left in crypto it won't be taxed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:15:54
Yeah, you'll be taxed on that, just like you're taxed if you sell stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:20:00
That is a good question, I have no idea. Hopefully someone else around here knows those details.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:48:34
Heh, I'm all about diversification. I love BTC, but putting all your eggs in one basket is a bad idea in any field.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:58:43
Don't expect to get rich, but buying a little to test out how things work is a good idea - you never know when you will have the funds to drop some more cash without caring about losing it, and when that happens it's good to be already familiar with the marketplace.

Speed depends on the transaction fee you pay. Generally Coinbase picks a fee that'll get it done, but not necessarily quickly. Lately with all the people buying Bitcoin it's not uncommon to see 2-4 hour waits, or even 8 in some cases. This is mostly because Bitcoin can only process a small number of transactions every 10 minutes, so you can be on the queue for a while - Litecoin and Ether process much more quickly, but in the coming year or two the Lightning Network should speed up Bitcoin transfers and reduce fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:18:21
Indeed, still pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:38:01
Oh, absolutely. It won't be quite as bad as Wall Street since the distributed nature of crypto makes your location less important, but you can bet that it'll still be dominated by a few big players. 
The profits they make won't really hurt your average person though. The people losing money will be those who are trying to do high frequency trading without the computing power the big firms have - to those who hold long term it'll be almost irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:58:32
Yep, can confirm. Bitcoin would only have 1% of the US monetary supply's value.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:23:51
Yeah, I'm only doing small amounts too and it's pretty silly when you want to transfer $15 to an exchange or wallet and it costs $5. :( The newer coins like Litecoin and Ether are much cheaper though, so I try to use them whenever possible and just have Bitcoin in my Coinbase account for now until I have enough to make a transfer worthwhile.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:16:49
Yeah, exactly. If the fee's too low, it might never be processed. So definitely check what the current fees are like.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:22:41
Probably a smart move - even if it rises you still save yourself the worry now, and if it drops then you get to come back in when it falls to a better price point. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:00
I'm not 100% sure, unfortunately I haven't tried either method. Worth trying though!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:58:16
I think they require you to upload government issued photo id, maybe also a selfie. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:26:36
Remember, earning Bitcoin is as hard as earning money then buying Bitcoin - so whether you work for Bitcoin directly or work for money and buy Bitcoin you'll end up in the same spot.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:31:10
Coinbase lets you buy from your debit/credit, but won't let you deposit money to your bank account. I believe Quadrigacx does though, so lots of people buy through Coinbase move it around various exchanges, then convert to CAD on Quadrigacx in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:55:09
Probably to start with, yeah. Definitely get verified there, and see if you can buy coins. If not, then maybe get a Coinbase account for buying. (Though right now Coinbase is kind of broken and isn't letting you buy, hoping that gets fixed soon.)
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:38:31
Fees depend on the exchange and the currency. For example, when you use credit/debit to buy crypto from a site like Coinbase they'll charge a fee - this fee depends on your country and is generally a fixed percentage of your order, so pretty easy to look up what that'll be. Then when you transfer crypto to another exchange or to a wallet you'll need to pay another fee - this is the transaction fee and it depends on the coin and the timing. The exchange may also charge a small premium. Right now fees for transferring Bitcoin are quite high, ~$5 in many cases because very few transactions can be processed per second and thus you need to pay more in order to get your transaction processed. On the other hand Litecoin or Ether are able to process more transactions per second so the fees are closer to $.20 right now. The fees are constantly changing depending on the number of people doing the computing, but in general Bitcoin does have much high transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:43:58
I think because it's just more complicated - IIRC they don't accept credit, if your debit card has the built-in Visa like most of them it won't work, Interac E Transfer is good if you have it but some people have a hard time getting it to work depending on their bank, just generally less convenient for a lot of people. If it works for you though it could be a good option.
