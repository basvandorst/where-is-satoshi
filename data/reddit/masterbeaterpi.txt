Im no expert but I believe someone could actually keep track of it all and make sure no one was creating "fake" cryptocurrencies or claiming they have more than they do. Google "Double Spending". It is not impossible.
 If it was regulated, doing these things would be illegal (if they arent already). I suppose to regulate it, a person or group would have to monitor the blockchain, and go after people trying to "Double Spend". I own no cryptocurrency. Never have except for a little Dogecoin that got hacked and I may have some litecoin in a digital wallet somewhere but I doubt it. I attempted to buy $1,000 worth in 2011 but I had a hard time since I also have a hard time uploading files to a online forum. I bought comic books off eBay instead because I know how that market works. Turned that $1,000 into about $7,000 in one year but I could have been a millionaire if I had not been lazy and gave up as soon as I got annoyed at having to put my email address and password into to much stuff.

I am saying that in a new playing field, new crooks can arise. Crooks smart enough that the government has to write in a law for their crime because it is the first time the crime is committed.

I said it was possible. It is possible. I stated a fact. Satoshi made it hard to do and also makes it harder to do as time goes by.

Maybe 8 years ago. When it had under 10,000 miles.

This market is still unregulated. Once they catch 5 or 10 people ripping off millions it will get some pretty strong regulations. The 
Wolf of Coinstreet isnt known yet.

I just sold a comic book for $125 this morning and I am happy with that. The comic book has a TV show based on it  that just premiered last night. Its called "Happy!" it on SYFY. I paid $25 for the book in July. I have 10 just like it (Graded) and about 40 copies ungraded. If I sell them all I can buy 1/10th of a bitcoin. My Wife has access to my paypal account so she will spend it on Christmas presents for the kids....

Its at around $10,500 now! Maybe $12,000 by tomorrow.

  You can get a used Lambo Gallardo for $80,000. The same price as a base model Toyota Sequoia. They are almost a dime a dozen to people with ACTUAL money. The only coveted model is the Countache. That's a million dollar car and the car everyone over 35 years old wanted when they were pre teens. Owning any other model is almost the same as owning a corvette. Not uncommon.

 I wouldn't be in the situation I am in if it weren't for luck. I was looking to buy my first house right when the market crashed. The lady across the street from me bought her house for $30,000 cash. Its worth $200,000 now. I am not retiring either. I just have not worked in 3 years. I will go back to work as a Union Electrician next year because my Wife wants to save for College funds for my kids and I want to buy more off road vehicles and motorhome, boat, blah blah. Maybe a Tesla. That screen is at least twice as big as my 8.4 inch.
 I was considering the move out of state but it looks like I will be moving back into the house I am still paying on next year. My kids have friends and school out here and I can always go back to work in Los Angeles.
After my Mortgage, car payment, car insurance, 4 cell phones, internet, blah blah my monthly income is more like $500. My bank account has about $20 in it right now. Collect rent on one house tomorrow though...

10325. It will probably be $12,000 by new year. I dont have any but oh well.

I own 2 houses in Lake Los Angeles. Basically it looks like Trevors neighborhood in GTA V. I get $3,500 a month from them both. I am still paying $600 a month one one of them. Yes, the mortgage is really 600 a month. I bought it for $70,000 in 2010. My car payment on my $30,000 Jeep is $650 without insurance because my credit is as low as you can get. Right now I am living at a 3rd house (rent free, I don't own it) In Palmdale, California. I live in the ghetto. I consider myself poor since my income is under $50,000 a year and I have a Wife and 2 kids.

Yeah, I went off subject. As far as a Lambos not being "affordable", you know that making $300,000 a year is considered middle class? 
 My Dad had his Gallardos clutch replaced once in 10 years. You are right on the cost. His yearly tune ups were around $1,200. I would say you could own one for around 7 years and spend a little less than $20k on maintenance. An 18 year old working a union construction job could afford that.
 
That being said I am poor as fuck and admit you know more than me about the subject of owning an expensive car.

Perhaps. I chose to live a modest lifestyle in exchange for retiring at age 35. I make my money renting out properties I own. I drive a $30,000 Jeep. I don't value the dollar that much. I value my free time.
 My Dad worked in the Elevator Mechanic union for 39 years. He had to sell his prized Lambo about 3 years ago. I had to loan him $15,000 to help pay off his Mortgage he was $40K behind. We are kind of poor. I am not some kid that had things handed to him.
 
Edit. I am not really retiring. I just have not worked in about 3 years. I will go back to work in a union construction job next year.
