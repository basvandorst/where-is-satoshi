God damn, I wish I'd had more money. Was only able to get a little more than 1 bitcoin back in April when I read the articles and reports that it was set for another climb only this time more sustainable. Really wish I'd had a few more thousand stashed away for investment or got in a month earlier. Still happy with what I'm seeing. I'm definitely in this for the long haul though and ready to weather a potential crash because I believe ultimately bitcoin might be worth 50k or more. Already looking like a profit with friends and family though which is nice :D

Freudian slip on my spelling haha

I'm pretty good about just not looking when I get the urge to sell. As soon as I start thinking that I remind myself what the ultimate goal was and just stop looking for months at a time.

Yeah I just checked again. I don’t believe you can move the coins to another wallet if you buy through the cash app
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:39:15
Ahhh okay so nothing is instant, gotcha.
So is coinbase the way to go? And if so, I should probably set up an account asap and transfer funds since they will be held for a bit anyway.

New to following bitcoin this closely. Still pending transfer of funds to coinbase pro, but looking forward to getting my first bitcoin and change sometime this week. I'm going in as soon as the funds hit, but I see some articles say it will fall to the mid 4k range soon before another eventually rally in the future. Any thoughts on that? Truth to it, or do people think it'll hold around 5k for the long haul as the new low?
@_date: 2019-04-09 22:40:58
Yeah seems to be, but not a deal breaker or anything.

Already verified identity and just waiting to verify my account. Glad I asked I had no idea coinbase pro was a thing!
Coinbase has an app, is there a version for coinbase pro or all that must be done on a browser?
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:20:05
Oh I did. Been completely debt free for a while now :D
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:36:29
I definitely plan on holding for a long time, so yeah the hundred bucks here or there won't matter much.
Someone else mentioned the professional exchanges which have lower fees. Should I look into those, or is coinbase the go to for a reason and I should just do that and keep it simple. Plan on buying 1 now, and possibly investing small amounts into bit coin every so often.

Oh like I said I'm definitely getting in as soon as the transfer clears, just thought I'd get some opinions on the couple of articles I've been reading since I know that I know nothing haha.
Now this may seem like silly question but, DCA??
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:10:39
Yeah I read that it would take 3-5 days to go through. Now I didn't see this but was wondering. Say I buy now, will it lock in that price point until the bank approves the transfer?
Also I read that if I buy with say my debit card which pulls directly from my account and is instant according to what I saw on coinbase, then there would be no delay right?
Depending on the answer I guess then what I could do is, if I don't get the ledger by Wednesday night before I leave I could buy bitcoin through my bank which would lock in the price, but not go through for 3-5 days, by which time I would be back home and have my ledger to insta transfer. That is a great backup option if that's how it would work.

Appreciate the help!
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:20:42
Really? Good to know. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:38:01
Sweet, glad I asked around here. Coinbase pro sounds like my best option
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:07:52
Damn you with logic. Yeah, security I guess.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:14:12
Sorry I think I understand your reply, but am just a bit confused. Are you saying I would need to wire transfer money to one of the professional exchanges (who would be?? Coinbase? or the ones you listed like gemini??)
Currently I'm only planning on buying 1. Now a transfer fee is fine, no problem. I thought I saw something about coinbase charging like 3.99%, which on say $5,200 isn't going to change my decision on buying, but obviously if I can find a more reputable place for less then I would. But yes, if the bank transfer fee is the big fee then I have no issues with that at all.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:14:51
I don't really care about anonymity so if that's the only issue then no problems here.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:36:19
I actually already got cash app and that was my preferred method of purchase, but I thought I read that you can’t transfer them, is that wrong? I assumed I couldn’t transfer to a hard wallet

Yeah those are a lot of the things I was worried about. I had a feeling the BTM's would be more than ATM's themselves. 
So since your username is Miner62 and you made no mention of it, I take it there's no real money to be made in mining bitcoins?
