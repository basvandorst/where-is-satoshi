And then there is India, which is planning to ban Bitcoin. Good luck with that.

By boss and colleagues don’t seem to be understanding what Bitcoin is! I recommended they buy Bitcoin when it was around 1k, but no!! They refused and laughed off and argued with me saying it was a Ponzi scheme and that it would crash.  Most of them are CFAs and MBAs with years of experience. 
I went ahead and bought some at that price. 
Guess who’s having a good time!!

Imagine if the same person bought Bitcoin worth 450 million $....

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. 
We are not too far from winning.

I was on the sidelines for the past 3 years on whether to get in or be comfortable watching things pass by. At that time I did not give much attention to benefits of Bitcoin or Blockchain.  I always thought it was a passing fad. 
But since beginning this year I read deeply and watched lot of videos on Bitcoin and Blockchain. This knowledge helped me dive into Bitcoin. Nowadays most of my paycheck after expenses go to Bitcoin. 
Cheers to all hodlers.

I have not sold any as yet. I am in it for the long term. May be my retirement kitty. I may also get into some alt coins.

Invested around $7k when Bitcoin was $3500. So happy now.

I did. Instead of my fees as compere for the event, I requested organizers to put the bitcoin logo and they obliged.

My well educated (CFA, MBA) laughed at me when i started buying Bitcoin at 3500. They said it was a Ponzi scheme and it would crash soon. ��.
