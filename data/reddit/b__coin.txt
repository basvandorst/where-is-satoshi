yea but large companies also mitigate risk.  like separation of duty, firewalls, SIEM tools, etc.
I would peg this as a high urgency but low priority issue on a majority of my systems if I were affected.

FreeBSD is an operating system.  The operating system provides a random number device that applications request (/dev/urandom, /dev/random).  If you or any company you use generates wallets in the FreeBSD OS, you are likely at risk.  If you use windows or linux or a company which does not use FreeBSD, you are likely not at risk.
RNG is usually built into the operating system.  Sometimes an operating system does not have a random number generator or a poor one (see SunOS 5.6, 5.7).  Random number generators just listen to a bunch of devices that give off seemingly random data (network adapter, mouse, keyboard, processor current, etc) to generate a random number stream.  You can bake this into the OS to avoid developers duplicating the work.  Alternatively you can build your own RNG that wouldn't be vulnerable to OS based RNG.  However if your RNG is based upon FreeBSD's RNG then you are also at risk...
Does that help make sense or did i confuse more :)?

all keys because the seed is predictable.  the problem is your system may not be in the correct state to be attacked.  for example, the seed may be predictable because it doesn't build enough entropy.  but what about systems that have a bad grounding or are highly traffic'd or have otherwise higher entropy?  it would be more difficult to attack.  
normally, a bad PRNG leads to bad seeds which, when you control the environment, leads to knowledge of the seed and thus can recreate private keys.  since you have no idea what system is  being controlled you should regen any keys dependent on the random number generator 
EDIT: also no, you are not at risk if you are not using freebsd's RNG

You have no idea if you do not control the wallet.  Does blockchain, does bitfinix, does silkroad??  You would have to inquire with their support teams

You would have to ask the developers if they are using the OS-provided RNG or a custom made RNG.  If they are using the OS provided RNG and you are not running FreeBSD, you have nothing to worry about.

You should really just ask the developers and then post your results here.  They work on the code base on a regular basis.  They would be able to answer much quicker than joe C random from Not everyone has the time to look through the code for every wallet.

potentially.  likely not though.  this would need to be exploited in conjunction with other attacks to compromise your keys.  with that said, you have no idea if you are the target or not.  better to just regen your keys to be safe.

Yes, Exactly.  
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:19:19
Then you already have the answer :)
