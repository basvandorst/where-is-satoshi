You probably could but what if you get audited or something? It’s probably very easy to hide crypto from the US gov’t at the moment but I don’t know that it’s worth potential tax fraud charges to do so
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:50:26
Yes it is :)

SegWit and Lightning Network are meant to fix the two problems mentioned.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:07
Well like the other guy said! If you used GDAX by chance or coinbase I guess they have a tax reporting tool. Otherwise yeah you might want to comb through your trading history and see how you ended up money-wise
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:10
So goes the old saying: it takes money to make money
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:01
Sure. Why wouldn’t it be allowed?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:11:54
He’s right. Every trade, even if it’s to another crypto, is a taxable event. Let’s say you buy $1000 worth of BTC, value increases to $1200 and you buy $1200 worth of ETH. $200 capital gain to be reported there. If ethereum drops back to $1000 worth and you trade back to BTC or fiat that’s a $200 loss so if offsets the gain. That’s the basic guideline I believe

I’m all mobile at the moment, so I use Blockchain only. Bread wallet is also good for Mobile I’ve heard. As far as electrum goes, I know it’s legit and widely accepted on this subreddit.
The best it gets is to buy a Trezor or (my preference) a Ledger Nano S which are hardware wallets.

As a professional developer, I can attest to the fact that developers themselves do indeed consume APIs frequently to do development.
In fact I would consider using an API in my program that verifies a BTC address to be a programmatic solution. I just didn’t have to write the low-level verification logic - smart.

If you’re in the US it’s totally allowed but keep in mind that every trade is a taxable event, even if it’s between cryptos. So if you gain/lose legally you’re meant to report it on your income for the year. And taxes on short term (&lt; 1 year holding) gains is higher than if you held for &gt; 1 year

If you did a bank account purchase the price locks in when you click buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:22
For the average Joe, yeah. It takes significant investment now

This is a pretty mean thing to say about women - there are undoubtedly women already on this subreddit who are going to read this now. Not cool
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:36
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:11
You’re correct
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:36
You don’t have to reason it out, it’s the reality. For BTC, his comparison of $1000 increases years ago versus today and the amount of time it took seems more reasonable in light of the relative percentage change.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:23:47
Interesting. Maybe because people watch for large transactions and it moves the markets if someone suddenly dumps 200+ BTC? Who knows
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:50:56
What do you mean by “printed” it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:17:17
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:33:19
OR should I throw them on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:42:38
It seems well-established and more secure than a Coinbase cloud wallet. I realize the next step would be buying something like a Ledger Nano S for cold storage but it seems good for now.
If you have recommendations or criticisms of Blockchain.info I’d love to hear them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:39:04
Your coins can be on both?? How?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:36:52
I don’t see why it would? Fees are fairly low and if you have it on your own wallet, you could send it to something like GDAX and sell via limit orders which means they charge you 0% fee - all you’d pay is a small tx fee moving it from wallet to GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:11:39
Where do you suggest we buy?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:33:06
So I should leave them on my digital wallet for now? What if wallets don’t support B2X, would I then transfer to coinbase/GDAX or some exchange to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:18
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:27:17
Let’s say they stay in a non-exchange wallet like my Blockchain digital wallet. What steps would I take to redeem my B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:39:20
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:19:10
You are absolutely correct, it happened before I clicked submit on this post and I didn't realize.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:14:55
Coinbase + GDAX = no fee if you do it the right way
Transfer USD into CB (no fee)
Log into GDAX (using CB account because they’re the same company)
Insta-transfer USD from CB to GDAX (no fee)
Buy BTC on GDAX (someone said limit order but I’m sure a market order is also no fee on there? Check it out I guess, I’m about to try for the first time in a few days) (no fee)
Transfer BTC back to CB. May not even have to do this if there’s a way to go right back to your own Trezor or Ledger wallet or whatever

Why now instead of at 3k, 4K, etc? People seemed to think it was topping off at each of those landmarks and here it is teasing 8k
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:31:27
I have the same question. I have BTC in a Blockchain.info digital wallet and want to know what the best way to redeem them will be
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:40:42
Can you explain this process? I moved mine to a Blockchain.info digital wallet. How do I immediately get my B2X if this goes down?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:05:15
99,999%: 1789 Days
10%: 11 hours and 16 minutes
That seems reasonable lol
