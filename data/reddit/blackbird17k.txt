That's not an accurate analogy.
With Dogecoin, most people are mining with GPUs they already have or things of that nature. It's more like saying, if we want people to learn about electricity, then we should encourage them buy a flashlight.
And who cares if people are ignorant? People learn by making mistakes. If people can afford to make thousand dollar mistakes, then they can do it. If they can't, telling them they're stupid won't make them less stupid, and it won't make them like you, and it won't make them like BTC.

People really need to read the posts and not scare monger around here.
This is about money transmission, which is exchanging one currency for another for profit. What is money transmission? It's exchanging currency from one currency to another for *profit*. This has nothing to do with simply accepting bitcoin as a means of payment; this has nothing to do with exchanges that operate within the small margins that are not considered profit, and this has everything to do with following State and Federal law for money transmission licensing and following money laundering laws.
See my post [here]( about money laundering.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:07:30
You are wrong.










Thus, as you can see, if you purchase property with the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity (SUA) (such as drug dealing), be it BTC, planes, trains, automobiles, or boats, it's money laundering, and use that property to conceal the proceeds of the SUA, you're money laundering (assuming you meet the other prongs).

@_date: 2014-10-09 00:13:26
I'm trying here, man, I really am.
Look, this is how the Fourth Amendment works: there are two questions. First: was the Fourth Amendment violated? Second: is exclusion (i.e. the keeping out of the evidence stemming from that violation from the criminal trial; what you call "thrown out") the appropriate remedy?
Generally speaking, the Supreme Court has been trending over the past three or four decades to view the exclusionary rule with more skepticism, while widening the precedents by which exclusion is not viewed as the appropriate remedy.
If the FBI relied on good faith in doing their search, then it probably won't be excluded. If the FBI didn't have a warrant or other appropriate judicial approval, but the search was reasonable because they had probable cause, then it probably won't be excluded.

That's really not what money laundering is, and it's a shame that posts and comments like this get up-voted, because really should educate ourselves about the law in our countries.
The United States federal money laundering statutes are found at 18 USC [1956]( &amp; [1957](
With the important caveat that this is not legal counsel: generally, money laundering involves one of two things: engaging in a financial transaction to hide the proceeds of specified unlawful activity (SUA), or engaging in a financial transaction to subvert a reporting requirement.
A specified unlawful activity is defined in 18 USC 1956(c)(7). It's a long list, but generally speaking, it means something that's already criminal. For instance: if I sell drugs for U.S. dollars, come to you, a bitcoin remitter, and tell you, "I would like to change my dollars, which I get from selling illegal drugs, into bitcoins," and you say, "Yes," then you're guilty of money laundering. If you don't know why the person wants to change the money to bitcoins, then no harm no foul, generally speaking.
So here, in this case, a cop went to this guy, wanted to buy bitcoin, and told him it was for something illegal. That's money laundering. The guy should have told him, "No thank you," and maybe reported him to the relevant authorities. He also should have followed the relevant state (Florida) law on licensing money remitters and transmitters.

I really think you're misstating what happened here. Whatever your views on the State are precisely, and I imagine our views aren't that far apart, what happened here was not, "The State wanted his money that they didn't control," but rather, "The State doesn't let people use currencies, even virtual currencies, to launder the proceeds of illegal activities."
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:23:55
The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred—i.e., that a search or arrest was unreasonable—does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies. *Herring v. United States*, 555 U.S. 135, 140 (2009).
@_date: 2014-10-08 19:31:47
The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. Generally speaking, you need a warrant, but if you don't have a warrant, and you have probable cause, courts may find that the search in question was reasonable.

A lot of the posts here really miss the point.
**It doesn't matter that Dogecoin probably is an unstable, inflationary currency that's going to crash and burn.**
**What matters is that it got a shit load of people interested in cryptocurrencies.**
I'm a good example. I'm some schmuck who was always interested in crytpocurrencies, but BTC seemed way too involved, seemed to have way too much of an investment, and *didn't have a welcoming community.*
So DOGE comes along, and the people are fun, I can mine with Mac laptop GPU, and people are very helpful and supportive. Make money? Lose money? Who gives a shit, it looks like it's going to be a fun time, and I'm *learning a helluva lot about cryptocurrency* as I go about it.
A couple months later, I've bought ASICs, and I'm mining some serious SHA-256 shit. DOGE is a gateway to the broader crytpocurrency community, and instead of being assholes to them, we should be welcoming to them.
and other communities need to understand this: you're not going to get adoption of BTC by shitting on casual users. You know what we call casual economic users in the real world? **Consumers.** They're the people who buy shit. And if we ever want vendors to sell our currency, we need to not to piss off and alienate the people who are going to buy shit from vendors with our currency.
Uncle Sam never called me an asshole. He never called me stupid for using his greenbacks. He never said I was participating in a "fad" or a "celebrity" currency. He just said he would back my debt, public and private, and didn't judge. BTC needs to be the same way.

You need to understand, the future of crytopcurrencies aren't in miners, but in consumers adopting. The average schmuck who's going to pay a couple Satoshi for a cup of coffee isn't going to mine. And if they burn some money on mining hardware that doesn't yield them an ROI, who cares?
needs to care about adoption, about getting people educated about cryptocurrencies, and about welcoming people into the community, regardless of whether or not they're treating BTC as a commodity to mine, hold, and invest in.

Well, there's two points.
Firstly, it's not just "selling bitcoins," but selling bitcoins beyond a certain profit margin such that you're a transmitter. Exchanges, which exchange with very low profit margins, are regulated differently than transmitters.
Secondly, it's not "now" illegal. This isn't a law targeting BTC, but a law that has existed for a long time, and will continue to exist for a long time.

Oooh, ad hominem attacks instead of engaging in the discussion.
See, what you fail to realize is that everyone is in this to make money. Can I make more money mining Doge on a laptop GPU than the electricity costs? Probably not.
But I'm having **fun** (oh, noes! bold words!), and fun has *value* to me, beyond its financial value. Until you realize that people in the dogecoin community derive value from their activity that isn't measured by cryptocurrency exchanges or ROI or inflation rates, then this community is going to continue to be discouraging to new users.

Part of stopping crimes that result in financial gain (which are many, many crimes) is preventing people form hiding the proceeds of unlawful activities.

Let me be clear: if you, or someone else, has questions about the legalities of their businesses, compliance with federal, state, or local regulations, **go talk to a lawyer**.
However, let me say this: a lot of people on whenever something legal happens involving BTC, make a lot of really uninformed posts often scaremongering about how the government is out to get them. I think this is very misleading to lay people, who are unfamiliar in the law. It scares people off from joining our community, and of course, is simply false. I know of no law, Federal, State, or Local, that was passed to specifically target bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. There are many laws, of course, that apply to complex financial transactions, to currency exchanges, to money remitting and transmitting, and the like. People should be familiar with those laws, educate themselves about them, and if they are running a business, hire legal counsel or compliance officers to ensure that they comply with applicable laws.
We gain very little as a community by misrepresenting how laws affect bitcoin and what the government is doing from a criminal perspective about crytopcurrencies.

I'll try to deal with all of this in turn.


This appears entirely to be speculation. There is no *evidence* that anything like this occurred. It's also my understanding that Ulbricht's defense team had access to a forensic copy of the server.


Again, speculation.


I agree with you: this is highly implausible, and generally beyond the scope of the NSA's mission parameters, which really isn't interested in run-of-the-mill drug prosecutions.


...which accusations do you believe Ulbricht's was not guilty of?


It's my understanding that Dratel's team was given forensic copies of the SR server that was seized.


I have no idea why his defense took the strategy it took. It puzzled me immensely as I followed it at the time. It was particularly strange when Ulbricht denied a possessory interest in the server during the *Franks* suppression hearing, thereby denying himself a substantive hearing on the Fourth Amendment issues relating to the search and seizure of the SR server.


I'd like to think I'm not dismissing anything "out of hand," but it seems ... wholly speculative to entertain these notions that some super-secret intelligence *could* have done all these things when there's not a shred of evidence that they *did* do any of these things.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:58:18


How? As in, "How does the fact that some agents committed misconduct make it less likely that Ulbricht committed the charges offenses?"

I don't know what you think a trial is. What do you think a trial is? Is to "determine whether or not a person committed the crimes they are accused of?" or "let's talk about everything that ever happened to anyone regarding an event?" What do you think happens during a trial?
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:29:56
"withheld this info to the jury" is incorrect. "Withheld" implies that the jury had a right to know, and they did not.
There are three broad categories of discoverable information in the United States. Rule 16, Jencks, and Brady/Gilgio. 
1. Rule 16 is, broadly speaking, information that the government intends to use as trial. This rule is not implicated. 
* Jencks information is prior statements of witnesses whom the government calls at trial. Because the government did not call these two witnesses at trial, this rule is not implicated. 
* *Brady* and *Giglio* broadly stand for the proposition that a defendant is entitled to exculpatory material evidence–that is, evidence that tends to show that they did not commit the crime. *Giglio* also applies to impeachment evidence of witnesses who were called, but as explained above, the agents were not called as witnesses. Merely showing that other persons also committed crimes does not tend to show that Ulbricht himself did not commit these offenses.
Thus, to tl;dr it all: many on who follow the Ulbricht trial have made a big deal about how these agents were correct, but as far as the *law* goes (and you may disagree with the law), there was no obligation for the government to turn this information over prior to trial and no reason for this information to be put in front of the jury by the defense.
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:00:55


Factually, that's not my understanding of the situation at all. It appears that the agents had the forum account of a root forum admin  (not DPR) under their control for a brief period of time. This is distinct from root access to the *server* or the DPR *forum* account or Ulbricht's *personal* computers. Thus, it's my understanding that they could *not* have forged messages between DPR's forum account and anyone else, nor fabricated any of the evidence found on Ulbricht's laptop, nor fabricated evidence found on the server, or other evidence used at trial.

There was extensive motion practice about whether or not this information about the agents would get in. Dratel made his arguments, the government made theirs, and the judge excluded the arguments. If you're interested in it, I highly suggest you read the pleadings. Undoubtedly it will be appealed, but I doubt that Ulbricht will get far, as the judge's ruling was well within her sound discretion.
@_date: 2015-07-03 02:46:32
*shrugs* Not sure we're going to make much progress having a civil discussion here.
The U.S. justice, as most others I know of, lets you charge multiple crimes arising out of the same set of facts. Thus, if I rob a bank and I use a gun, I can be charged and tried in the same proceeding with both 1) robbing a bank, 2) using a gun to commit a crime of violence. Such is the case with the multiple charges against Ulbricht.
What I'm referring to is the principle that we don't permit the guilt of a person to be determined by their prior (unrelated) past acts. This is embodied in the Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). 
FRE 404(b)(1):


@_date: 2015-07-03 02:48:28


Indeed. It's part of a prosecutors' ethical obligation not to taint a jury pool.


Then Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, makes the arguments to the court (as does every lawyer trying to bring in every evidence) that the evidence is admissible under the U.S. Constitution, statute, or Federal Rules of Evidence.


This is more difficult, in that one can have protection orders preventing persons from discussing admissible evidence in the media.


Correct. There are far fewer mechanisms that prevent a defense attorney from speaking than prevent a prosecutor from speaking publicly.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:40:56


You say that like it's an insult. ;)




No, I don't think so.


Well, the question is about *these* agents. Because DEA Agents A &amp; B committed misconduct, does it mean that we should not trust DEA Agents C &amp; D. To put it another way, do we impute onto *all* DEA Agents the misconduct of *some* DEA Agents? I would say, "No." Otherwise we might have a situation where whenever *some* DEA Agents testify, we have to bring out all the misconduct committed by *any* DEA Agents, or *any* DEA Agents in their division/component.


I don't think so. Plenty of facts simply do not make it more *or* less likely that *Ulbricht* committed a crime.


The question is *which* DEA Agents. Did any of the DEA Agents who *testified* in Ulbricht's trial commit misconduct? No. Were any of the DEA agents who committed misconduct even members of the same office in the DEA as those who testified? Again, no. The agents who committed misconduct were from the Baltimore office and ran that part of the investigation, and the agents who testified were from the New York office.


Well, that's actually a major premise of the U.S. criminal justice system: we should judge people based on whether or not they committed *this* crime, and we don't care about whether or not they committed *other* crimes. Thus, when on trial for murder, we don't permit the jury to know that that defendant committed murder in the past. The term of art in the law that we don't permit evidence of past bad acts to "prove conformity therewith"–that is, we do not permit the jury to hear evidence that because the defendant did a bad thing in the past, he must have done that same bad thing here, in this trial.

Because they only had an extremely brief window of opportunity (a few days) during which they had an admin account on the SR website.

Which witnesses who testified at Ulbricht's trial were "corrupted?"
How is "extortion," and I presume you mean the extortion of Ulbricht, relevant to whether or not he committed the crimes he was charged with?
Which subpoena were forged that yielded evidence that was admitted in the trial against Ulbricht?

@_date: 2015-04-06 02:22:10


That was not his defense. Ulbricht claimed he owned and operated SR at trial. He probably did not claim what you propose simply because there was no evidence to substantiate such a claim.


It's not the roll of the government to disprove every single unsubstantiated and speculative defense theory, but rather for the government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I don't see how it didn't do that.
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:55:01
I don't see why these investigators' character is relevant. They didn't testify. No evidence from their investigation was introduced at trial. Inasmuch as you may believe evidence flowing from these two men was "tainted," it appears that the government "washed away the taint," but only introducing evidence from a different investigatory team that was not part of the "tainted" Baltimore team.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:46:44
Well, as long as you're admitting that your arguments don't have any relationship to what happened as a matter of *law* at the trial, then I don't really need to engage them.
My point is merely that this trial appears to be held in accordance with the rules, procedures, and laws with which we hold all trials. If you have issues with those rules, procedures, and laws as such, well, that's a different question. But Ulbricht's trial appears to have been fair, and I suspect none of these revelations will affect any of his subsequent legal proceedings.

Sorry, but that's not really true.

"Fruit of the poisonous tree" doesn't mean what you think it means. It's derived from the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment. It generally means that one cannot use the fruit of an unconstitutional search. It does not mean that if someone does something that we think is bad, everything that flows from those things is inadmissible. So ... since this isn't a fourth amendment issue, the doctrine does not apply. I need not belabor how badly Ulbricht's defense team screwed the pooch during the suppression hearing by denying a property interest in the server. But even that issue is irrelevant as to the admission of evidence during trial.

Interesting. Weinstein doesn't have a white collar background, but a gang / organized crime background. Good catch.

Every single comment thread about Ulbricht pisses me off and drive me out of and the wider cryptocurrency community need to get off their libertarian high horse and realize that our goal, ultimately, is to show that bitcoin is a tool, like money. Like money, bitcoin can really useful things: it can be used a secure way to store value; it can be used to engage in economic transaction; it can bypass expensive fees that banks charge. But it's a tool.
And tools can do shitty things. We don't have to praise and defend every single asshole who uses bitcoin. Ross Ulbricht ran the equivalent of an open-air drug market. Now, some people think all drugs should be legal always; all courts are oppressive; and the government is one, monstrous entity bent on destroying us all. You're stupid. But to those of us who recognize that society deems open-air drug markets "bad," there's no reason we need to be going all rah-rah and defending Ross Ulrbricht.
By all appearances, the government put on a professional trial. There was no misconduct; there was nothing out of the ordinary; the relevant statutes covered his conduct. By all appearances, Ulbricht's defense counsel was tragically inept, the kind of ineptness that makes attorneys familiar with federal criminal law scratch their heads, but not the kind of ineptness that gets you an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
So you see, the rational part of us, the part that wants bitcoin and the greater crytocurrency community to grow could say: well, this Silk Road thing shows a lot of the features of BTC. It shows how it's extremely useful as a currency that provides anonymity, security, verifiability. We don't, however, support it being used as a tool to help hire people to murder other people. Or buy and sell drugs and weapons.
Imagine if we were gun manufacturers. We think our gun is great. It's accurate, good capacity, well-priced. We want to sell people on our gun: we want it used in competitions, we want it used by hunters, etc. It *doesn't* mean we have to congratulate every asshole who uses it to murder another person.
Bitcoin is just a tool. It's a revolutionary tool, but just because we like it doesn't mean we have to like everyone else who likes it.

No ...
The issue is that BTC's decentralization removes the incentives for institutional actors to prevent money laundering. If I'm a bank, the government has laws and regulations designed to make sure that I put in policies to discourage money laundering. If someone uses my bank to launder money, I can face civil and criminal consequences.
The issue with BTC is not that it makes it *easier* to track money laundering but that its decentralized nature doesn't permit government systems to place pressure on institutions to create anti-money laundering regulations. You can't pressure or punish the BTC system the way you can with centralized banks.

"Beyond a shadow of a doubt" is not a legal standard in United States courts ... or anywhere.

Ohhhh, so there's one "BS legalese" rule you want, and that's the set of legal principles surrounding mistrials, but not relevance, eh?

Given that the agents did not testify in the Ulbricht trial, I cannot imagine that the government had any obligation to turn over any material about this. Certainly not under the Jencks Act, since they didn't testify. And neither under *Brady* nor *Giglio,* since these allegations don't tend to exculpate Ulbricht.

Welcome to my friend. So many people view mining as one of the only "legitimate" ways to get currency. They simply neglect the simple principle that in order for cryptocurrencies to gain traction, they have to be available to *consumers*. Telling a consumer they need to buy a few hundred dollars of mining equipment to get their currency "securely" is BS.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:08:30
I don't know who the hell you are, and I don't care. I'm just commenting that tends to be *very* mining centric.

I followed the trial.
Rather than make some uninformed statements about what did or did not happen, why don't you educate the audience here, and explain why, as a legal matter, Ulbricht was forbade by the government from testifying on his own behalf, hmm?

Actually, you're wrong.
Federal Rule of Evidence 403:

A motion for a new trial is generally made as a matter of course by federal criminal defendants after being convicted. It is done in part to preserve errors for appeal, not out of any extremely misbegotten hope that the judge will grant it. "Seldom" doesn't begin to indicate how rarely such motions are granted.

Well, my read of the government's responses are that the so-called New York team collected all the evidence admitted at trial. While these agents were from the Baltimore team.

This is super old and out of date. You cannot mine with the old Block Erupters successfully in any pool. The min payout is more than you could ever mine.

Are Ulbricht's statements about the drug war relevant to whether or not he committed the crimes charged?
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:59:52
Okay. So now we've moved on from "Ulbricht's trial was unfair," to "the entire legal system, which includes rules that apply to all trials," are unfair.
So...I think we've moved beyond a reasoned analysis of the Ulbricht trial, so I'll take my leave at this point.
