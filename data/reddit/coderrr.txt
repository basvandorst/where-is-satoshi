fyi, dont do this, it got the story killed off the front page
and we weren't really 'paying for posts', we were giving 0.5BTC to the first 5 insightful comments THROUGH COINBASE.COM, emphasis important

Thank you for the coverage, BitPay.  I'm the technical co-founder at PrivateInternetAccess.com, and I wanted to take a few moments to clarify our commitments to privacy and, moreover, anonymity.  We posted a tutorial on our blog (  ) which details how to signup anonymously without any risk of leaked identity.
We are very committed to anonymity.  Back in early 2011, I created the anonymity patch ( which helped to create an extra layer of anonymity in bitcoin.  Alongside Andrew, we also built btc.to, the bitcoin address shortener, mtgox live, and mtgox mobile - all in order to push bitcoin further.  The latter three projects were acquired by Tibanne, the parent company of Mt. Gox (  ).
We are very much still committed to the advancement of Bitcoin on many fronts.  We're losing our privacy, but together, we can bring privacy back.
Thanks for taking the time to review our service and we really hope you like it.

yea the broadcast version only had one quote about why the creator of bitcoin chose to stay anonymous.

yea, doesn't look like it'll be going into the official client though :/

I think anonymizing on the IP side of things is pretty easy.   Just proxy through tor or i2p.

tx = transaction, not tax.  The column basically allows you to see the max amount you could send from an address if a tx fee were added to the tx.  This client has nothing to do with the MtGox exchange.

The MtGox websocket isn't back up so that's why you can't see live trades yet.  Hopefully will be back soon.

here's a first step:

I don't believe any identifying info is released while you're downloading the blockchain so you could do that w/o TOR.  And then only use TOR when you're sending a tx.  I believe that's the only time when you actually reveal information, specifically linking an IP with a Bitcoin address.
Although I'm not 100% on that
@_date: 2011-06-30 11:01:28
That's fine since most people don't care about anonymity.  So most people won't use TOR.  But if you want to be anonymous using TOR is no problem and isn't going to affect the overall network.
