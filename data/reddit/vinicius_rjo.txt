How do I move it to a wallet that is more secure? 
A: I personally use Blockchain.info, as they don't keep my private keys. But I have plans to buy Ledger Nano S in the near future (
I am a mega-noob and know very little about the bitcoin. Is a paper wallet the most secure?
A: It is at least more secure than online wallets. You can also enable BIP0038 on the paper wallet, so you have the private key plus a password you define. It can make it more secure (unless you select any ridiculous password as "1234".
Can I add bitcoin more than once to the same paper wallet?
A: Yes
Is a hardware wallet more secure than a paper wallet?
A: Yes (I think).
