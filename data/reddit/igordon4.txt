Take away; i was teetering on buying a bit more btc this week, you, in a way helped me decide
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:23:13
Yes (for a while not forever)*.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:52:35
Heard someone say “bitcoin takes 7 steps forward, and 2 steps back” lol

@_date: 2018-01-16 04:57:06
I felt the same way a week after my purchase, within the month i saw an almost complete r.o.i
Just stay confident
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:46:57
You did well��������
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:25:11
Congrats to you, hope it continues to grow for the all of us
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:41:30
Hey I’m really sorry to hear this, i really hope it slows down for you, this can be scary, my girls sister was told she had a small “brain lesion” she persisted so much at the doctors, they did nothing, you could tell something was up with her tho, she didn’t act the way she did in the prior years i knew her, leading up to it, her personality was changing, she was VERY self centered, arrogant, and needless to say a total bitch
She ended up going to another hospital (the best brain surgeons in our state) the same week, come to find out she had an extremely serious brain tumor which gave her a slim chance of survival even with surgery but immediately she went into surgery, she’s luckily in the clear for now, hopefully forever, they said any later she probably would have died
I’m just sharing this as a story for inspiration, i know it’s not the same, but keep holding on, never give up, i truly hope things get better for you
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:27:32
Tbh, this is what you had to be in it for (generally speaking), I’m just looking for financial stability and in your situation i completely understand, i would’ve made the same move
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:22:32
Yeah I’m playing the waiting game right now
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:59:38
Just saying I’m 21 got my first CC about 6 months ago, the only card i could get was navy federal bc their interest rate is like 12% every other bank is about 18-24% 
18-24% 5 times would literally run me into the ground
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:12:29
I believe it was extremely close, i know different exchanges show different things but i believe coinbase showed the ATH at 18650 last week
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:07
Are you implying the entirety of reality ISNT an alien TV show?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:59:12
By dangerous yes, but dudes made some other stupid decisions before that, i still think the stuff he does is badass but I’m just not into it anymore, just didn’t age well
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:53:18
I’m with these guys, you gotta think about this from her end, if she found out, what kind of guy would she think you are, she’d think you didn’t want to marry her, or worse you didn’t want to marry her bc you didn’t want to spend the money, she’d think she wasn’t worth it to you, 
I don’t mean to say that sounding condescending i just mean she may take it really wrong,
BUT if you’re not ready, tell her about the explosion, 20k could/will probably- be hit next week, and 25k could possibly be the next, i bet she wouldn’t mind you staying in this game when it means extra money for the both of your future, maybe ask if you can bump it too 30k and keep the 10k in coin
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:30
I’m guilty of watching the grass grow today, it’s almost as tall as the fence
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:18:45
Would also like an answer, ty
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:40
RemindMe! 287 days
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:48:06
Hahaha how i felt watching it hit 14k live
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:32:09
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:59
I bet a friend $10 it’ll be over 15k by Friday if this continues
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:21:30
I keep telling my brother “just throw $100 in right now, i swear you’ll thank me later” if it goes as high as 100k by 2021, that 1/100th of a coin, will still be worth ~$1000
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:01:37
Should say “bitcoin dips below 13k!!!!”* 
Would make it seem extremely less dramatic, outsiders probably think dips are a bad thing, when in reality they can get ahead of the curve right now. (Should this hit the moon)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:03
Hey man hope everything goes well for you
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:51:19
Yes if you’re willing to wait and not touch it for a while
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:57
Yeah i think i have 3
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:30:38
Lol dropped a K at 11k, i saw where i fucked up, looking to buy small increments every 2 weeks to 1 month,
I salute anyone that made the mistake i did, and honestly hope for everyone the best in their investments
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:28:02
“Only buy what you can afford to lose” is what I’m seeing everybody in here say, my dad taught me to have atleast three months of bills worth of savings, anything on the top save that too for if a car breaks down or you need surgery,
I do plan on continuing my purchase because i continuously see people also saying “my only regret is that i didn’t buy more!”
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:53:51
18.7 right now!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:31:56
Just came to say thank you for donating to these places, I’m sure the money will be well used/needed and it’s very kind!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:57:07
Are you the one that set this psychological barrier, intending to have no double numbers or pattern so you could actually break the barrier? Like an ocd thing? I think i saw you posted this in a comment only a day or so ago
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:27:35
2nd this
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:01
Thanks for the reference! Will do
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:50:07
NICE! I plan on putting a hefty down payment on my first home in my parents neighborhood, and the other half to buy me a ford or Chevy truck, really hope our plans go well!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:51:25
Such a different car lmfaoooo, didn’t even know about this car until i built it in forza
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:43
My question-can i pm you instead i have a few questions i would like to privately ask
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:54:08
Ahaha Im feeling you, i wish i could sell everything but my tv Xbox and speakers to buy more btc
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:56:37
I’m truly sorry for you and your lost relative, and i thank you for trying to reach out to others, peace be with you✌��
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:25:43
I’m hoping for 15k by Friday
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:27
I’m a newbie, extremely new, the speed at which it was paid was insanely fast
Can you tell me some of the advantages this has when compared to other cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:36:30
My ONLY regret is not starting sooner!
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:48:35
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:27:57
Hoping to start doing this very soon
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:54:30
Thank you for the information, i will be using this very wisely in the future
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:44:20
Please drop, I don’t have enough yet for the rise!
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:52:04

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:05:48
Good for you man, thanks for sharing!

HEDL needs to be a shirt, that’s hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:32:46
Dude I’m saying, i put in 1000 at the high point last week and I’m freaking out over getting a measly 150$ profit, if i held from $24 all the way to $5600 I’d probably crap my pants, even if it did go to 12k the next week
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:49:38
That would be 11k right now lol
Edit: it happens, just do what you can afford
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:45:20
!RemindMe 2 years
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:49:38
Dude i want one so bad in between a trezor and a ledger HELP!
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:27:32
Used to love this guy but he makes some seriously stupid, dangerous moves i can’t support
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:50:00
wish my dad taught me this when i was 12 loooool now
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:51:58
Big time Benz fan, i love the s-class cars they’re gorgeous

Dreaming of the FCC lmfaoooo
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:00:56
Right, are you saying youre not buying until 5900? Bc thats not guaranteed
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:48:23
9800 on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:28
Bought high, informed myself, felt stupid, realized what i had done, blocked out the noise, excited for my future with this
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:59:13
9900 was the lowest i saw yesterday, 5 minutes later it was back above 10k, near 10200 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:04:07
“It’s up to 107 right now!!”

Hey bro just wanted to say no ones judging you on the “high-risk/high-reward” game, but no ones patting you on the back for the money you made YOURSELF either, some of us can’t afford to “not be a pussy” (and that’s not a bad thing)
I’ll have fun with my crumbs when this is a full blown- around-the-world currency, have fun with your money, hope you don’t have to spend it one day����
