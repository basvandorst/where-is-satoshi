Lost so much money that you had to sell your nice car and buy this instead?

Maybe but I think todays return on GBTC was about 44%, which was more than the return on BTC since yesterday at 4pm. So i think because people can use their 401k, it is returning higher at the moment as it gets more visible, especially with fidelity announcing a mint-like view of coinbase.

Im still confused about this law. If i leave my private keys "at home" when I travel abroad, am I good? Or does having $10k in bitcoin automatically need declared every time I leave the country, regardless of the location of the keys?

What defines entering or leaving the US? If I buy bitcoin on my computer in the US then sell it from my computer in the US, has it entered or left the US? Or does it mean when I specifically leave the US? if I take my computer with me do they think I'm taking my bitcoin as well? I'm so confused about your last sentence. Sorry if I'm being dumb.
Also this part:
"“(e) Monetary Instruments With Amount Left Blank.—For purposes of this section, a monetary instrument in bearer form that has the amount left blank, such that the amount could be filled in by the bearer, shall be considered to have a value of more than $10,000 if the instrument was drawn on an account that contained, or was intended to contain more than $10,000 at the time—
“(1) the instrument was transported; or
“(2) the instrument was negotiated or was intended to be negotiated.”."
Does that mean I can't take a check book across the border if my account has $10K in it?
