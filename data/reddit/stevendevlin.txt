It would have to be the exact opposite-- when goes up its a sign of increased demand, and you'd have to increase supply, not decrease it, to make the price more stable.

All of the energy a computer uses is converted to either light, heat or noise, with the vast majority being converted to heat. A computer is pretty much exactly as efficient as a space heater in making heat, with the added bonus of having computational power.

I don't disagree, and if Tater was the one who posted the 'bitcoin has already won' comment, I'd say he was being serious. Instead it appears he was mocking the guy who said 'bitcoin has already won' .

Soo its main use is micro-transactions and removing users from the dollar price of the products they're buying? To me, it seems like the only way they could make it work is to either link the price directly to dollars (or Bitcoins, but I think linking the price to Bitcoin with its current instability, would hurt the amazoncoin's credibility). Taking over the blockchain would serve amazon no benefit.

That's the entire point. When one entity controls 51% of the total mining power, they can choose what is done by mining. If a 51% attacker decides to stop broadcasting transactions in their blocks, and rejecting the rest of the blocks created then bitcoin rolls to a halt.
This page sums it up nicely. There's a good page on the bitcoin wiki too, but I cannot seem to find it. I think its titled "Weaknesses".
EDIT: Just realized that the page I was talking about is linked to in the first sentence in that article. Derp.

It must have been a coinbase error then. Lucky you!
Edit: I guess I'm being downvoted for not questioning this guys ethics. I'm just going to say that what somebody does with money that was given to them(on purpose or not) is their business, and not yours or mine.

I literally preordered the jalapeno yesterday(order 325 Besides the fact that I'm in the back of the queue, I feel great about my order, because i'm getting more GH for less cash.

Their moral obligation is to process the orders that were placed first before the orders that were placed last, and to return people's money. As long as they do that, I see no moral or ethical problems.

Why would amazon want to do this? I can't see why a company would want their own currency. In all honesty, I don't believe currency that isn't backed by a government will ever be used on a day to day basis by the vast majority of the population(but I can hope), and as such, they'd be taking a huge risk giving people money for Bitcoin, because if their private currency system doesn't get adopted, they've lost hundreds of millions or billions.
I also can't see why amazon wouldn't just make 'amazoncoins' out of thin air, as it would be free to do, and the BlockChain really wouldn't matter if these amazoncoins were only used on amazon.com

Actually, their service seems like a pretty decent idea but knowing now that they're patent trolls, I'd be very reluctant to give them my ideas for the next hit app.

This 'crash' has taken us back a full two weeks! I think we need to panic!

The first one was a BFL FPGA minirig, the second one is the real deal, but it's only 1/3 the minirig. I'ts only 500 GH/s while the minirig was supposed to be 1.5 TH/s(bfl shipped out 3 of these for each minirig order made before april 5, 2012).
So depending on your definition, the asic minirig may or may not exist in the wild.

You can make a tidy profit at minimal risk, but it takes weeks to remove money from Mt. Gox, so you'll have your cash tied up for extended periods of time. It's called arbitrage trading, and arbitrage traders generally stay away from Mt. Gox for that exact reason.

Josh, the CEO of BFL, flames and insults people on the bitcointalk forums all the time under the name Inaba, which is the same account he uses to conduct business on the forums. Its pretty fair to say that BFL does actually insult people.

go to Coinbase, linked accounts, and grab your linked bitcoin address(es). Look it up in block explorer and find out where the coins came from.

Well they DO have a prototype now, as broken as it is. Since they are currently honoring refunds until 60 days after shipping, i felt like the potential rewards (100% ROI after ~4 months assuming the price of bitcoin holds steady, accounting for a 20x difficulty increase) is worth the risk.

Do you mind if I add electricity cost to the mix and repost it in this thread?
If so, I'll post it after work tomorrow.

And the 51% can stop any/all transactions from being validated, so the 11 million coins would be worthless if they can't change hands.

I disagree. It would certainly help the stability of bitcoin, but Mt. Gox is responsible for allowing people to trade, not making a stable market. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:27:22
I'm going to bet they are either planning on making 2.5 GH or 5 GH cards based on what they've learned, and have based their numbers on that.
1-2 in the jalapeno, 5-10 in mini, 10-20 in Single.z
BFL has really fucked up their planning, IMHO. they made cases which are now worthless based on cards they've never tested. They had higher power draw which completely invalidated their cooling systems. I understand they rushed everything (because they set fucking ridiculously unobtainable shipping goals) hoping that everything went according to plan, but when's the last time that anyone has undertook an extremely complex project in a field they had very little experience in with nothing going wrong?

Not irrelevant as much as insignificant.

We need more people to move to exchanges other than Mt. Gox, but I don't know if it's possible. Having most bitcoin trading centralized in one location is bound to make that location a juicy target for attackers. 
The problem I see is all the new investors trying to jump on the cash cow want to go to the biggest exchange. The least we need is 3 big exchanges, each with less than 25% of the volume of trade.
