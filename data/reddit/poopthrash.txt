Fair enough. I guess I should have been more specific; we wish to fund the construction of the shack entirely by Bitcoin.

In the letter written to Yellen, Sen. Manchin claims that millions have been "stolen" from BTC users by hackers. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the only time any substantial amount of BTC were stolen when the FBI seized Silk Road funds?

When they read you your rights they say, "Anything you say can and will be used **against you** in a court of law." Police are not permitted to testify on your behalf, only against you.

Well, in the U.S. that law is only applicable to money transfers. Federal law has not yet recognized Bitcoin as a foreign currency, so the case may be made that he did not in fact violate the law as it is not applicable in this instance. OP was selling a commodity that the customer purchased with illegal funds. Additionally, I believe the sender is the only one who needs to report the transfer not the recipient of the funds (however I may be wrong on that one).

I thought the intention of bitcoin was to eliminate third-party institutions in exchange for efficiency and anonymity?
