Yeah fuck the banks. But that will be much easier once I've made enough easy money to pay off the mortgage. Priorities.

Nice moustache! Good video too.

Well I can kind of understand this if it was a major transaction that you wanted verified immediately eg before they drove off in the lambo you sold them. If it’s your employer it just seems like additional cost.

I did some googling there are a few articles covering this, using google trends estimating how many people are searching for how to buy BTC.
And we’re seeing a huge spike correlating with the price rise as you might expect:
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:50:01
But after all of that A, B, C &amp; D all end up with a different amount than they started with (most likely). So how could that be recorded as one transaction, not four?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:59:04
Pretty fucking easy when it’s not your money

Yeah don't listen to this guy, I'm actually from kraken I just forgot to put it in my username.
I can confirm we are aware of your transactions, we escalated it all the way up to posting on reddit about it, which is practically as good as receiving proper customer service.
The problem is, it takes several agents to check our bank account for deposits, and another several to confirm the name of the person who's bank account it came from. 
Maybe next week we'll get round to having another group of agents send you an email about it. Hope the fact you've lost out on 50% gains is OK!
If you want any more support just drop us a line on reddit.

Don't listen to these reasoned responses. I 100% guarantee it will double by tomorrow.

Interestingly the last few days a lot of the other cryptos were rising (not just BCH) it was strange it felt like people were divesting out of BTC. I feel a lot happier that everything is dropping together now.

Go here &amp; get reading:

Eh? If your employer sends direct to your cold storage address then you can check on the Blockchain that it has received 6+ confirmations making it essentially irreversible. 
What does running your own node achieve? The whole point of Blockchain is the network effect ie multiple nodes not just yours verifying that blocks (inc your transaction) are valid.

I felt much more comfortable with the price rise when it seemed like it was being driven by adoption and usage rather than news articles highlighting the price and how much you could have made if you bought a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:41:54
You made $3... who gives a fuck?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:03:26
I like these charts and I believe/hope they apply to btc adoption.
But I think it’s a mistake to overlay the price chart of bitcoin against them because they are showing different things: % adoption != price. Although we anticipate  a relationship here true.
I’d love to see a chart showing number of people using bitcoin over time and whether we’re seeing exponential growth in adoption as well as just price right now.
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:32:58
It's all in the wording though, look how the headline has slanted this.
I'm sure it's much more  'would you be willing to be paid in Bitcoin' ?
(Yes, for sure in theory, if there were a good reason for it, we all know I'd be converting most of my salary to fiat to pay the bills anyway.)
Rather than  'do you want to be paid in Bitcoin' (implying like, right now, I'm demanding it, we're already to switch from fiat.

Let's say Amazon start taking bitcoin and they close the channel every day. 100 different people buy something. 
- That would be 100 customer addresses needing updating on the blockchain. Same as without LN.
- But the Amazon address would only be updated once? So saving 99 transactions?
- Also if things are not updated on the blockchain until the channel closes then what stops you spending the same coin multiple times elsewhere since the blockchain has no record of you no longer having it?
(Note I well aware this will have been considered by the geniuses that come up with this stuff I am not trying to pick holes in it, just understand it)
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:50:56
You make no sense.  Spend your money on lessons to improve your writing instead. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:35:25
Yeah I think exactly the same, I have no idea what is required to make VISA transactions work and nor do I care. I think with bitcoin everyone has heard of it but there is a mental hurdle of at least needing to understand it a little bit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:46:42
I know it sounds daft but i feel more concerned about losing a piece of paper or forgetting where I hid it than being hacked!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:38:56
But that's the thing, I started using the internet in the early days of 1995/96, I'm a technical user.
And I still find a lot about bitcoin confusing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:35:58
Yeah that is true I guess. Until you want to get your money out into a UK account. But that's a rant for another time...
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:45
Err, no. I mean it would be nice and all but let's face it the people with the money hold the power and they sure as shit aren't going to give it up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:35:49
OK thanks I had not considered that. So if I understand right if I have a hardware wallet, when I go to spend and it prompts me for a password then a keylogger can still capture that... but the actual private keys are held only on the wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:51:38
I tried veracrypt and it annoyed me how slow it was every time I wanted to mount a container and run Tor. 
But as per other comment I think I should separate where I keep the wallet/tor now anyway - I figure I can wait a minute or two when I finally come to sell!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:06:54
You know I have actually thought about whether I could start my own exchange, make it idiot proof, somehow minimise or improve the ID verification part etc. And I am OK at web development so it’s not totally unfeasible. But if I’m realistic I’m not good enough to make it secure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:30:54
haha - I once saw a documentary where a man who couldn't get erections had a bladder installed into his penis and then one of his testicles was removed and a sort of pump put in there. A few squeezes and he got a hard on.
Could be considered an upgrade.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:45:08
Great thanks. I guess a hardware wallet makes the most sense for when you actually want to spend bitcoin, especially regularly.
For my HODL wallet I am not needing to do this for the foreseeable future so I'm more concerned about not losing it entirely and ensuring it's backed up. 
I should probably put it in another container though since I do mount the file to use tor occasionally.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:30
Yeah let's assume I will not be putting it online or saving my seed in a public reddit post either
