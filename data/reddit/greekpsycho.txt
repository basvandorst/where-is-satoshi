24Milibtc as in 0,024 btc.Just like a milimeter is 0,001  meters.Not sure if this is sarcasm because I had to read it a couple times before I understood it
EDIT:My math was wrong, thanks to u/oilbro770 for correcting me

There is a  problem with that analogy,gold actually has SOME inherent value.if tommorow so ehow 99% of gold disappeared,the remaining 1% would skyrocket because gold is needed in elctronics,or as a collectors item in jewelry and so on.If we lost the private keys to 99% of bitcoin,we'd just stop using it

Google defines it as:"averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values".I feel like that is an accurate representation of what I mean.Stalin,and most other communist leaders,where pretty much dictators from the authoritarian left,they weren't progressive at all.The only difference was that they also enforced communism.In conclusion,while Trump is not a commie by any means,you can be a conservative and love the Bois in red at the same time

Well,someone like Stalin can't be considered progressive by any means,there he is sort of a conservative Communist.I don't care about the gab debate,it's just a weird thought I would like to discuss

Woah there,seeing someone NOT being a dick about politics on Reddit is so rare it's scary.

Never thought of that.The whole "free speech" debate was a grey area for me since both points were sorta valid in my mind.I think this guy is onto something though

Well,all this tells us is that btc gets a LOT more transactions on a daily basis.I mean didn't we already knew that?

Well...by that arguement then the market has already also decided against all crypto since we only have a very small fraction  of the market in the past 5 years.All this tells us,is that bitcoin is by far the most famous and probably the most trusted cryptocurrency but if we are honest that should have nothing to do with what coin we should trust.
I think that the endless debate on block size,true satoshi vision and how the blockchain SHOULD operate is a much better way of debating rather than going "our coin is up 0.02% while all the others are down" or "btc is better because more people use it".

Only difference is that if you buy books or TV series,you pay money for entertainment.Bitcoin isn't exactly "fun" without any returns
