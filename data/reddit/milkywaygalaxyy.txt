yes still learning, there is something I'm trying to figure out please . I transferred some bitcoin from coinbase to the "bitcoin.com" wallet like 2 days before the fork and I was wondering if I am ineligible to get my BCH, because of the thing they call no "key" ownership when stored in the bitcoin.com wallet. apparently I should've just left it in coinbase or bought an offline wallet, but coinbase said they wouldn't support it (at the time), and I didn't know that trezors existed. if you know if I can still access my BCH from the bitcoin.com wallet it would be very helpful.

I mean anonymity (like monero) not security. speed like digitbyte etc, have any of the new coins been hacked ? I will look into the tradeoffs

hopefully no paypal in the crpytoworld, UTRUST should be able to handle everything

yea bitcoin went down 50% in one day. did this come from an official website ? or can I buy the BBC shares really cheap.
I guess this would be from all the bcc member cashing out.

"protesting the monetary system you have been forced to use" I like that, especially since all the big banks are owned by a few select people from the 1800's

thanks, the reason I thought it was created by a young group or person, is because there are a lot of new altcoins that have bigger blocks, process transactions 1000x faster, better algorithms, security, etc etc. therefore the person or group must've been young or not formally trained right ??
