That is a valid statement! :) That's why vendors at CoinMall are able to setup 'Automatic withdrawals', this way funds get sent to specified wallet as soon as buyer releases the funds, no need to hodl the funds in our system. Also, we try to make minimal withdrawal as low as possible (but it is a bit hard to do when mempool is congested :( ).

This is a legitimate concern and we addressed it in one of earlier replies. If you don't trust CoinMall - just withdraw the funds after you sell the product(you can set up automatic withdrawals in user settings) or send them elsewhere after you receive a tip, no need to store funds in our system :)

 What is CoinMall?
CoinMall is a marketplace on which users can buy and sell digital goods for cryptocurrencies. We just launched the Alpha version, which includes new features and a complete re-work of the back end. The most appealing ones to our users:
1. Multi-crypto support: We currently support depositing and withdrawing Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin, more crypto to come soon.
2. On-site transactions are performed off-ledger, meaning users can list, buy and sell extremely low-value products without having to pay **any** fees.
3. A variety of vendor tools such as coupons, product delivery support, IPN's etc
Of course, there's a lot more new features, best thing is to
[check CoinMall out now!](

Only a CoinMall account (takes less than a minute to do so), withdrawals aren't processed through the Lightning Network (yet) so he'll instantly receive them on-chain :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:10:49
Thanks! After receiving a tip, the receiver sends a 'withdraw' command to CoinTippy via DM, after which the funds will be sent to his CoinMall account (on which he can send to his own wallet). 
Hope that answers your question!
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:43:34
Well, users can either accumulate their tips to reach a certain threshold before making a withdrawal - think of ChangeTip, or they can instantly spend their tips on CoinMall on any digital product without incurring any fees whatsoever.
By the way, we batch withdrawals and use SegWit, so withdrawal fees are very negligible. Once LN hits mainnet and we're able to process withdrawals on LN, it'll become even more interesting :)

Thanks for the help Elum :). For those of you interested in the answer: "CoinTippy and CoinMall are currently funded out of our own pocket, or should we say coins. 
Due to the fact that both CoinMall as well as CoinTippy are in Alpha phase, we feel uncomfortable with charging fees just yet. The only 'cost' on CoinMall is when sellers want to purchase upsells (such as promoting their products on the front page). If we do decide to introduce fees in the future, we will announce doing so, in advance, on our Social Media channels."

Good question :). What other service would you prefer to be linked?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:34:54
- CoinMall is a marketplace exclusively for digital goods. The front-page header states this :). We do not (currently) support the sale of physical goods.
- We don't collect user data by choice, indeed. Info is limited to IP address, and even that can get spoofed by using a VPN, TOR or the like, so not much we can provide to Law Enforcement. 
- We'll keep on innovating and trying new things out. We'll soon implement multisig transactions so users don't completely depend on the platform as well :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:46:10
Good suggestion! Not yet, but we'll make sure it's implemented within a few days (ironing out the bugs and kinks first)
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:42:05
I don't see how. Compared to Particl, OpenBazaar is the technically superior version.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:52:02
- We'll be sure to make an announcement post once it is implemented, shouldn't take too long according to our back-end devs.
- You do know Bitfinex was using BitGo (multisig) at the time of last year's hack and as a result reverted back to a hot/cold wallet setup? (source: 
- Certainly true. We do have one particularly skilled back-end dev who's quite experienced in setting up hot/cold wallets, as well as a monitoring system which immediately notifies us of any irregular wallet activity. Hopefully we'll be in the Localbitcoins category soon though :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:44:28
Whoops, I stand corrected. 
It's however still the case that small TX's aren't viable given network fees (buying 10 cent products with a TX fee of $0.50 for example). In addition, there's edge cases where users may depend on a low-value transaction succeeding, so having Escrow as an option for those transactions is preferable.
Good to see there's exactly 910 digital listings on OpenBazaar. I suggest you implement auto-shipping digital goods as soon as possible to make it more convenient for the vendors :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:56:23
You can indeed!
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:20:12
Done :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:17:49
Glad to hear you'll be joining :). The devs said they'll complete implementing ShapeShift so withdrawals can be in any (shapeshift supported) cryptocurrency.
Currently, and in the near future, there aren't any fees for using CoinMall except for withdrawals (miner fee, but we batch withdrawals to make it negligible). We only charge for listing upsells such as promoting a listing, having it featured on the front page and the like. 
If this ever changes, we will inform the community and possibly ask what they consider is an acceptable fee to charge, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there :)
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:12:54
This isn't bad since the funds will be used to build out the feature set of the product &amp; users can always opt to transact in Bitcoin only. 
If you however feel the need not to use OpenBazaar and are looking for alternatives:
- Purse.io for physical products
- CoinMall.com for digital products
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:38:24
Correct indeed, we launched the Alpha version today so it might take a couple of hours before someone decides to list a product. 
Feel free to create a listing yourself if you have something interesting for sale!

That's a legitimate concern, however we have taken the necessary precautions to make sure this exact scenario doesn't happen. This includes a multi-level funds storage system that ensures, even in the event of a hack, very limited funds can actually be obtained. There are more than plenty central Bitcoin entities with a similar model which currently thrive, such as Localbitcoins. 
We've chosen to not take the decentralized route exactly because of this. We believe that a centralized project will allow more people to access and use Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) without having to download a program, configure it to work and resolve unnecessary bugs and errors. 
It's similar to Bisq (formerly Bitsquared) and CoinBase. Depsite Bisq being the 'better' option, people will go for the more 'convenient' option that is CoinBase.
PS: In the near future, we'll implement a multisig option as well, allowing people who are ready to transact in multisig to do so. Hopefully that's an acceptable compromise :)

- Value proposition is solving fraud, charge-backs and identity theft in the digital goods ecosystem by utilizing cryptocurrencies.
- You do so with any other service such as CoinBase, Localbitcoins and Bitfinex already.
- AFAIK Amazon doesn't support the sale and purchase of digital goods. OpenBazaar can not support products below a certain value due to TX and moderator fees, whereas CoinMall does. 
- CoinMall provides P2P encryption for uploaded files and messaging. It's also pseudonymous, we don't collect any user data.  
May I suggest the following link for more info:

I disagree. CoinMall and Amazon can not be compared in the slightest except for the fact that they're both marketplaces. Amazon doesn't support digital goods, whereas Coinmall is centered around digital goods.
Why digital goods? Historically digital goods have been the primary target for fraud and charge-backs compared to any other sector. We solve this by utilizing non-reversible cryptocurrencies. Crypto and digital goods go hand in hand, so it's only logical to create a marketplace combining the two. 
I suggest checking out xough.com/coinmall to learn more on what CoinMall actually is before coming to a conclusion.

You're referring to the MVP version of CoinMall. CoinMall Alpha has only been available to use for 2 weeks. (We have provided our MVP users the ability to migrate their stores and products to CoinMall Alpha though)
6000 listings of which half are collectibles. Might buy myself some Pokemon cards. Or some weed: 
The article gives 5 convincing reasons why CoinMall is better. I suggest you actually read it.
