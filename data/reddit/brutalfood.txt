I have recently decided to go down the rabbit hole of crypto-currencies. Researching as possible (not being in the finance or computer fields). I have my wallet set up and have been waiting to get my feet wet by purchasing some bitcoin. Giving everything going on with Mt. Gox, what/who do you recommend for making my first bitcoin purchase?

Much appreciated. I have attempted share my interest with those around me, but they look at me like I want to invest in monopoly money. Which obviously, there is always a chance of bitcoin being worth exactly that.

I couldn't agree more. I heard a great podcast with andreas antonopoulos who really did a great job breaking down the immediate benifits and over potential revolutionary qualities of the technology.
Please forgive my greenness. I have been trying to figure out the commands to sends the Reddcoins to my Cryptsy address, with what seems like no luck. Any thoughts?

Yes. U.S. Good deal. Much appreciated. As really only being a week into my new found interest, its a bit difficult to keep track of which markets, wallets, apps are reliable, especially for someone who is not a professional within the industries. I truly see the long term potential, and want to get in (close) to the ground floor.

Ah. perfect. Yea that is really what I am looking for. Kind of want to get the feel of trading, verification, paper wallets, ect.

Well it is the unstableness that is most interesting part. I figure there is an equal chance of me losing all of my money as there is creating some sort of profit down the line.

Ah. Ok. Thanks for clearing that up. As always, when in doubt. Doge.
