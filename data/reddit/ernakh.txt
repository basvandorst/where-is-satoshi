A whitepaper is *less important*, that does not mean it is unneccessary.
0.01% of projects: You have a real world application, so you publish a whitepaper summarizing how you intend to solve it in an innovative way.
99.99% of projects: You want to make money on the crypto gold rush, ohh you need a whitepaper for that. Compress as many buzzwords as you can: AI, Web 6.0, Blockchain 3.0, Internet of Things, Money over IP, Internet of Money, Internet of Blockchain, proof of stake (passive money income!! 100% guaranteed), masternodes, Optional privacy, Smart contract platform, space mining, Quantum resistance, Deep Learning Smart Contracts, etc I HAVE TO THROW UP

Before its scaling problems, people did use it. I payed my lunch, bought my notebook, my brother bought games on steam. My last transaction was a reddit gold where I paid more in fees than the transaction itself and that is when I stopped using it.  Once the scaling solutions are implemented, it will be usable again.

This is my favorite part:

If I was a complete outsider, based on this performance, I would have the impression that these "bitcoiners" are just a bunch of anarchist with the same level of brainpower as this whole HWNDU nonsense. Even if I was there, I would have tried to stop that girl annoyingly chanting Bitcoin. I believe in intellectual conversation, if we convince those who can think, the rest will follow.

Does this reflect good on the Bitcoin community? Is this how we want to "advertise" it? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:10:15
exactly, this is why it is so painful to see that noisy girl continuously shouting Bitcoin in the same dumb way as that idiot chanting "he will not divide us".

And this thread is about discussing an idea. That is, maybe if you are an outsider, and look at this performance, you wont have a good impression about the Bitcoin community.

Zcash and Zcoin are two different things. Altough nothing more is worth mentioning about them

In this case, there is no difference in the price. You convert your ruble back to usd and you are at the same price as in the USA market. The minimal price difference between these are because they are all separate exchanges.
In India though.. now that is goddamn interesting

Thanks! Yes, I confused them.

And you should also highlight that this is Not similar to what is going on in India (arbitrage opportunity). It is just because the russian ruble inflated insanely since the war in Donbass region, so the chart is completely normal, no anomaly here.
Edit: war in Donbass, instead of Crimea.
I am not good with historical events, even if I was strongly affected by them

Ceasefire seems to be violated quite often though.

Holy crap! Did I just see a ~90% fall since 2008?
Seems like a good buy though, if things are going to catch up in Ukraine. What do you think?
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:47:46
Sorry, yes, that was nonsense :) I meant the conflict going on in the eastern part of Ukraine for ~2,5 years now. If I remember correctly the ruble crashed when they annexed the crimea, and has been struggling since.

Then it will be difficult to handle emotionally a +100% increase followed by a -50% drop

I don't understand downvoters.
