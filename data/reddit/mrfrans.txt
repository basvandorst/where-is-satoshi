To be honest I don't even like the lightning bolt for LN. As the lighting in the LN name indicates to me, speed, and not a lightning strike.

Forking is just a software term. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
If you start your own project, you can't just start to claim that its the original. That's why people have been pushing back.

Coinbase is being shady and is potentially going to recognize the hardfork as bitcoin.
Transfer your coins to a wallet you own. Pick one of these.
I use Electrum.

That is typical Interviewer behavior, they ask the questions that they think their general audience want the answers on.
