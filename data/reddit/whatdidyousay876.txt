i have been following it since February this year (this is a throw away). I have made been involved in discussions where people say that paying your taxes is like hiring a hit man because the gov pays for the army (when talking about DPR), which gets many upvotes. Yet when i say that i think paying taxes is not like hiring a hitman as you do not pay the army directly, i get many downvotes. 
I have said that i think bitcoin will be huge in the future, but the speed at which is has grown in the past (and recently but not so much) has been unstable and its better for the slower consistent growth at other times. Or that with the speed at which it rises, people speculate more and this partially defeats the point of bitcoins as not many people will use them. it is like with the pizza buy, whoever bought the pizza for 10k btc, does not regret it as it needed to be spent to help the economy. 
I really like this subreddit, and i do see a lot of the over excited posts being downvoted... i often downvote them if they add nothing except 'to the moon'.... but sometimes i get quite frustrated by it
sorry /rant over

How has Austrian economics helped their savings run out? I understand purchasing power decreasing due to inflation, but how is this down to Austrian economics? Austrians believe there should be as little gov intervention as possible in the market. Everything should be privatised, Thatcherism etc
If you state you will never pay tax on bitcoin, do you think the government are going to put up less of a fight against bitcoin?

To be honest this subreddit feels a bit like a cult / religion at some points :/ A lot of people flat out refuse to hear anything remotely negative about bitcoin.
