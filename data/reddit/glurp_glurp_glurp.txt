Ah I may be misremembering, then. I thought the HK simply was to propose a block size increase, not a separate HF non-witness size increase in addition to segwit.




Segwit changed the block size limit from bytes to virtual bytes, and a witness data byte is discounted 75% to only count as 0.25 virtual bytes.


Signatures are not moved outside the block, they are just allowed to be pruned. Segwit could have not changed the weighting at all and then it would not be a capacity increase, but just a malleability fix, quadratic sighash fix, script versioning addition, P2SH hash algo upgrade, and input value signing improvement. Without the witness data discount, however, segwit would not economically incentivize judicious UTXO usage the way it does with the discount.

@_date: 2018-01-19 18:08:47


Yes, it does.


Correct. Including a block size increase with segwit was a compromise (presumably fulfilling the Hong Kong agreement).
Segwit, by virtue of needing to be adopted, gains usage - and grows the block size - slowly.
Another main issue with a hard fork block size increase is that there simply isn't consensus. If such a change were deployed, it would inevitably lead to a chain split. A hard fork at this point in Bitcoin's history would also need a very long lead time in order to give people plenty of time to learn about the fork and upgrade their node.

They recently said they weren't taking any time at all. Not even working on it. Didn't even register as something in their top 5 things to work on this year.


You really seem to misunderstand things. What takes so long with a hard fork is giving people time to update and all get on the same page so consensus is maintained and chain splits are minimized.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:08:06
Supply of space for transactions is inelastic, and demand is occasionally much higher than supply.
You claim constant fees are more "efficient" than a constant block size, but fail to elaborate whatsoever on what "efficient" is supposed to mean in this context, much less give any supporting arguments for why it is more efficient. You also gloss entirely over the fact that no one can just make the blocks larger.
You also seem to completely misunderstand mining evidenced by your claim that the marginal cost to produce a block, or space for transactions, is fairly constant.
It is not. Simply look at the cost to produce a block over Bitcoin's history. The marginal cost can literally be any cost at all, with it's only constraint being profitability and aggregate self-serving interest not to mine at a loss.

Probably transaction batching. Did you receive this transaction from an exchange? If so, they likely combined many pay outs to many different people all in the same transaction to use less block space and therefore pay less fees.

Yeah, exchange hot wallets are probably running core and the exchange back end is using the rpc interface.

If I'm Coinbase, perhaps maybe 100 different people all initiate transactions in the next minute - or maybe it's 10,000 in the next 10 minutes - whatever.
What I'm doing right now is sending 100 different tx's - each with let's say 1 input and 2 outputs (one to the destination, one sending back the change). This is the smallest individual transactions can be. So these 100 transactions will have 100 inputs and 200 outputs total.
If I batch instead, I combine those all into one transaction. I might be able to fund this with 1 single input still. Maybe not, but I probably don't need 100 different inputs. And for outputs now I will have the 100 recipients and 1 change output.
So, 100 inputs + 200 outputs + 99x the individual transaction overhead vs. 1 input + 101 outputs and 1 tx overhead.
Coinbase is just straight up wasting well over half of the block space they use.

Yes, but batched transactions will *always* be smaller than unbatched transactions, and quite significantly so in the vast majority of cases. 
It is not possible for the batched transaction to require more inputs than the non-batched transactions (assuming a set with the same total amount sent).
Unbatched transactions will always take at least as many inputs as batched, and *very* often will require many more.

I have no idea what these percentages are supposed to mean.. tax rate maybe?
If you buy Bitcoin today at $11,000 and you sell it in 6 months at $20,000 then that $9000 difference is literally ordinary income in the eyes of the IRS - as if you'd received a 1099 for that amount.

Yeah but you said 1 billion tx's at 1 satoshi/byte, so anyone else would just have to pay 2 satoshi/byte to outbid your spam.
It would be more effective for to send fewer spam transactions with higher fees.
Also, if you're a miner, you might be able to implement transaction selection algorithms that lead to high fees.
Miners might find it more profitable to pick all of the tx's in the highest fee tranches, ignore tx's in the upper-medium tx fee tranches, and fill out the rest of blocks with lower-medium tx fee tranches.
This would leave upper-mid range tx's in the mempool and others sending new transactions would base what they thought was a necessary fee on these gamed mempool backlog tx's.

I know that some wallets will show you the fee and/or offer fee selection but.. how do I put this, the fee will be as if it were a non-segwit tx - maybe it shows 300 sat/byte - and then behind the scenes it will recalculate the fee according to the witness block weight discount and the actual fee might be 228.73 sat/byte or something when you check it on a blockexplorer.
I believe Ledger's software works this way. Not sure about Electrum or Mycelium.

@_date: 2018-01-29 04:44:30
Sounds like you don't quite know what you're talking about. 
As long as you've moved your BTC first, the only chains it could be replayed on is other shitforks that split at a block height where your UTXO's still exist.
Scammers can't steal your coins with a replay. They can only cause the same transaction to get confirmed on another chain.
Half these forks even had the same address generated by the exchange, so a replay would've just landed in my account anyway. And if it didn't, the exchange is the only one with the private key for the address your replayed transaction went to, and you have the private keys to any change addresses.
When I sent my BCX I risked losing a few other forks that were worth even less like BTF and BTW. Big whoop. And if I cared I could've moved those coins on those chains at the same time.

Not really.
A 56kbps modem can transmit about 4MB every 10 minutes. 4MB is the maximum segwit block weight. You're busted in an attack scenario (4MB segwit blocks won't happen under normal usage) without considering block time variance and steadily increasing hash rate.
But 9600 bps is the standard fax rate, which can only transmit about 700kB over 10 minutes. 14.4kbps modems are not uncommon in fax machines for about 1MB every 10 minutes, but it doesn't appear that 56kbps modems are terribly common in fax machines.

First, you should get Tails OS or similar, verify it, and boot from that without connecting to any network.
Then you can use GnuPG, KeePassX, or 7-zip (not included in Tails - download, verify, and put on USB) to type your recovery seed into a text file and encrypt it. 
Of course, you need to ensure you have your encryption password/key securely stored.
If you saved an unencrypted file with your recovery seed (before zipping it for example), be sure to wipe it from the drive appropriately (with a software tool to physically overwrite the storage area multiple times).
Copy the encrypted file to your USB. Now you can boot to your normal OS and back up that encrypted file to a couple cloud storage places.

This is a totally valid concern. Anonymity was over-sold in the early days.
The only solidly anonymous coin today is Monero, but you still have the exchange KYC/AML issues. No crypto can solve the problem of getting fiat into the coin anonymously.
It's not as though people don't know anonymity and fungibility are problematic in Bitcoin today. Off-chain layers like Lightning Network (which uses onion routing, like Tor) can greatly improve anonymity. MimbleWimble is another promising set of tech, combining Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin. Pegged, merge-mined drivechains can allow MimbleWimble to be added onto Bitcoin without major changes to the base protocol, if that proves necessary (consensus for base protocol changes cannot be reached).

EDIT: For posterity, before your edit you said the calculations are the same for BTC..
No, they aren't. BCH's plan is to keep block size always larger than demand, meaning fees should remain minimal. Fees in BTC can grow to whatever the market will bear.
There have already been BTC blocks where fees exceeded coinbase rewards. 12.5 BTC of fees in a block. Since BCH will never create fee pressure, 5 sat/byte should be *plenty*.
So, 12.5 BTC is 1,250,000,000 Satoshi's. In order to generate that much fee revenue at 5 sat/byte you'd need 250,000,000 bytes of transactions - 250MB blocks. But really 5 sat/byte should be overkill for BCH. 1 sat/byte should do it. Now you need over 1GB blocks to generate the same fee revenue as the block reward. BTC does it with 1MB.
That's also comparing coin to coin. If you want to compare $ to $ you can 5x your BCH block size with the ratio at 0.2. Back when it was 0.05 that would be 20-25GB blocks to produce the same amount of fees as the block reward.
When it comes to fees generated per byte of blockchain space used, BCH scales infinitely worse. It cannot possibly be sustainable as the coinbase reward dwindles. In just over 10 years the coinbase reward will be only 1.5625 BTC. Good luck with that, BCH.

@_date: 2018-01-13 08:17:05


Considerably. If you send 100 minimal transactions that's at least 100 inputs + 200 outputs (destination &amp; change) + 100x the tx overhead.
One batched transaction would be however many inputs you need, maybe just 1 + 101 outputs + 1x tx overhead.
Each input is I think 180 bytes, each output 34 bytes, and the tx overhead is 10 bytes.
So it could be 100 in + 200 out + 100 tx = 25,800 bytes
Or 1 in + 101 out + 1 tx = 3,624 bytes
A difference of 22,176 bytes. If you paid 200 satoshi/byte that's a savings of 0.044352 BTC or about $634 right now.

I'm not sure where to begin with how many incorrect assumptions you're making here.


Do you think it took $200 bln of net inflow for Bitcoin to reach the price it is at today? It didn't. Market cap is simply price times number of coins in circulation.


So you think everyone will just know when appreciation has "slowed down and eventually stopped"? Like, it's just coming to come to rest at an exact amount and stay there? How else would *everyone* know it's reached that point?
And then *everyone* is going to sell for fiat, or even just the vast majority? All at once? And how long in the future will this be? You seem quite certain that this point will be reached before goods will be available to be bought for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:02:11
No, the market was in an absolute fervor. New people buying like crazy, at least some sending to their own wallets through places like Coinbase that over pay fees and drive them up. More than that you probably have people - especially newbs who just saw 50% gains in a couple weeks - sending back to exchanges to cash in on profits. Then, probably the biggest bidders on fees, you had exchanges literally running out of bitcoin for sale and huge discrepancies in the price between exchanges causing people who run arbitrage to scramble to jump the line and get confirmed so they could scalp the difference in profit.
Now the sells have happened, arbitrage has happened, the rate of new incoming transactions has returned to normal, and the mempool is steadily clearing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:36:26


You got it. Each incoming transaction created a UTXO - unspent transaction output. When you create an outgoing transaction, it will include as many UTXO's as necessary to cover the amount as inputs.
If you have many UTXO's you can send all of your Bitcoin to a new address and then that address will now have just one UTXO, so any future outgoing transactions will only need to include one UTXO, making the transaction size and therefore fee minimal.
You of course want to consolidate when the mempool is clear and you're in no hurry. It is possible to get those transactions picked up for 1 satoshi per byte.
Keep in mind that consolidating UTXO's reduces your anonymity, as it connects all the previous UTXO's. With the state of blockchain analysis these days, I'm not sure that matters much. If someone really needs anonymous transactions they should be using Monero for now.

Don't worry, it's not like an obvious thing until you run into it. If you receive lots of incoming transactions you'll have lots of inputs, and occasionally you'll want to move them all in one transaction into a new address to consolidate the inputs, and you'll want to do that when the mempool is clear and you can wait for a lower fee to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:27
It's probably going to take several days for the mempool to largely clear. You can see the current level here: 
If you go to the bottom graph and hover on the right edge you can see where the fee amount goes over 1MB. Paying more than that will likely get you in the next block. The amount is in satoshi per byte, so you'll have to convert to $. A single input transaction is about 250 bytes.

Wait until the mempool clear up and you'll be able to send it for like 10 satoshis per byte, maybe less. It might be a week or two before the mempool clears.
To view the mempool check here: 
Hover your mouse on the right edge of the bottom graph. Look for the lowest fee amount that still has less than 1MB worth of transactions.
When I took this screenshot, that was 30 satoshi/byte. Set it a bit higher if you want to be extra sure you confirm in the next block (you might not need next block) - if a batch of higher paying transactions comes in before the next block gets mined, you might get pushed back a bit.
I'd also take this as a prompt to learn about wallet maintenance so that you don't end up in this situation again - with a ton of inputs needed.

No. I think what the poster above you means is that we don't know what the in-real-life network size, topology, etc. is going to look like until it's actually real (and even then it will change over time), and that perhaps the size and shape of the network will not be sufficient to fulfill the promises of LN. If that's what they mean, I would disagree. The wallet software being built automatically manages your connections. There are still engineering problems to improve relating to calculating optimal network paths and managing replenishment of channel funding, but there's no shortage of good ideas and work is ongoing. It's not like LN won't work without those improvements, but it will need them to continue to scale. Just like block size took many years before it became a hard scaling limit, so will these suboptimal parts of LN.

Even better, it uses a protocol similar to Tor to route your payments across LN hops from the source to its final destination.

A single input non-segwit transaction is 250 bytes, at 20 sat/byte that's like $0.60.

It's the money someone paid in the last transaction.
Imagine (obviously unrealistic) that for a day no one but you and I traded Bitcoin. I agreed to pay you $1M for 1 BTC. The price of BTC is now $1M and the marketcap is now $16 trillion, yet $15.8 trillion did not just get spent buying Bitcoin.
There's 16M and change BTC in existence. The current price is $15.5k. The market cap is 16M * $15.5k = $248B. Yet many of those Bitcoin were sold for $1 or $10 or $100 or nothing was paid for them at all (mined, so maybe electricity and hardware costs). It didn't take $250B being spent on Bitcoin to reach a $250B market cap.
Really, market cap is a fairly useless metric for cryptocurrency.


What about 2014? Appreciation obviously slowed down. How would you know that wasn't the end?
It is not a requirement that some people lose value. People do, for sure, and people certainly would if everyone tried to sell at the same time. Real world value created is constantly increasing, as is population. It is possible for Bitcoin to rise in value indefinitely while no one loses value. In reality, people sell at a loss at times, but it's not a requirement.

Right. I thought we all hoped to transfer wealth from those curmudgeons who would be silly enough to short Bitcoin.
I also don't see the market sentiment among all the people and institutions that trade on CME, CBOE, and Nasdaq having an overall different view on Bitcoin than the current market participants. Both sets of people are sufficiently diverse. Most everyone likes Bitcoin gains and can see that this "bubble" is a small fractal of what's possible.

I agree that the time has come that the benefits of a block size increase, given the current state of the entire crypto ecosystem, outweigh the detriments to a block size increase.
It is time the community supported segwit2x. This is the only reason it failed previously, because it lacked community support. And I don't mean garzik's broken implementation, but hard forking and doubling the base block size.

1. If you're moving into or out of a cold wallet, you are most likely not in a hurry. You in fact are not in a hurry. These big mempool backups are temporary events. The market was going nuts this week and arbitragers are willing to pay nearly any fee to scrape profits between exchanges. Just a few days ago transactions paying under 10 satoshi per byte were getting in the next block. The mempool is quickly clearing again.
2. Use segwit for smaller transaction size and therefore lower fees.
3. Use a single transaction with many outputs to load all your wallets at once for even lower fees.
4. Include in your gift a lesson about how Bitcoin works and how your loved ones should properly care for their money.

This would be 100% pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:10:14


Sure, several. 
Larger blocks aren't worth any of the costs associated with them because they are a complete dead end. Demand will quickly rise to fill any remotely plausible size, if not in weeks then in months. 2MB blocks would be full the moment they deployed. When you consider future growth and use cases enabled with low fees, block space needed rises exponentially. Watch 6 minutes from here: 
There isn't consensus. No matter what you think, enough people prefer to stay with the current rules that there cannot be a hard fork block size change without a chain split.
Studies show a rise in block size to 4MB would knock a significant percentage of nodes - even entire geographic areas - off the network. There is clear evidence this block size or larger would be harmful to the network, reduce decentralization, and increase the number of people who would no longer be able to trustlessly transact.
Larger blocks further advantage mining operations with access to faster networks and those that are geographically near other large mining operations. They increase centralization pressure in mining when this is a pressure we should aim to reduce or at least not increase (these factors as well as electricity costs already present centralization pressure at 1MB).
Larger blocks decrease resistance against certain attack vectors.
Low fees are unsustainable. If you allow any transaction throughput and consequently fee pressure to build, you are always just a traffic spike away from high fees. So let's assume if you want to raise block size you have to always keep it above demand and therefore fees should remain a minimal 1 satoshi per byte. This is BCH's philosophy. The current block reward is 12.5 BTC. In about 11 years it will be 1.5625 BTC. If you wanted to maintain the same block reward with fees in a large block chain you would need 11 BTC in fees, 1,100,000,000 satoshi - over 1 GB blocks with minimal transaction fees.
There are already scaling solutions available. Segwit can provide up to double the transaction capacity once it is widely implemented in the ecosystem. A handful of large economic nodes generate more than half of all on-chain transactions, adoption can happen quickly. Transaction batching is also not widely used. Some protocol uses like Omni appear to be inefficient. It's not ok to trade resilience and decentralization and trustlessness to support middlemen business services externalizing the costs of their inefficient use of a public resource. We don't want to create a tragedy of the commons.
High fees right now don't matter. What's unique about Bitcoin isn't fast and cheap payments. What is unique about Bitcoin hasn't been replicated by any other coin and isn't likely to in any amount of time shorter than Bitcoin has been around.

Bill Gates and Richard Branson have both been publicly pro-Bitcoin.  And you have people like the Winklevoss and Novogratz, and likely many more 8-10 digit net worth individuals that are potential buyers.
And that's just individuals. Investment funds are buying 10's of millions at a time and futures makes it safer for more firms to hold a portion of their portfolio's in Bitcoin. These funds aren't swing trading and panic selling. If the overall market values Bitcoin higher and a single actor or two tries to drive the price down you'll see the hundreds of millions flowing in to buy the dip. We're already seeing it. 10,000 BTC would make for a short lived dip. Who's got 100k to sell to really have a significant effect?

~~Close to 5%~~ 2-3% of total network throughput during peak times.

Yes and yes. It takes effort across the entire ecosystem of Bitcoin software to get meaningful results. Bitcoin tends to be conservative with changes, aiming to remain technologically stable for 100 years. Unfortunately popularity has outpaced scaling over the last year, but work has been done and is starting to come to fruition (transaction capacity is up near 10% since segwit activation in August and will rise to 50-100% as larger service providers update their wallet software, Lightning Network is coming, drivechains, schnorr signatures..)
In the meantime, it helps if you send from a wallet that allows you to set fees, which Coinbase does not.
Some wallets will give you a slider or something in the UI and estimate how quickly that fee level will confirm (1st block, 5-10 blocks, etc.).
You can also set it more specifically without doing any math.
Go here to see the actual mempool stats: 
Hover your mouse on the right edge of the bottom graph. Look for the lowest fee amount that still has less than 1MB worth of transactions.
When I took this screenshot, that was 30 satoshi/byte. Set it a little bit higher if you want to be extra sure you confirm in the next block - if a batch of higher paying transactions comes in before the next block gets mined, you might get pushed back a bit.
Also it sounds like Overstock is doing their own estimation of what fee is "enough" so even if yours is enough, they might overestimate what is needed. They really should just show you how much they think is enough.

This is just baseless speculation.


It's the reserve banks that have the most to lose. Governments might actually be happy to get out from under their thumb. It's also pretty hard to stop things like torrents and tor. A price crash is detrimental, but Bitcoin has bounced back stronger from each of it's several 80%+ crashes before.


To small money and dumb money. I kinda doubt that's the case to smart money and big money. Bitcoin is much more than a piece of code. It's head start on numerous network effects shouldn't be underestimated.
The best and biggest mindshare, arguably the best development process, the most decentralized distribution of holdings, the largest and most decentralized verifying and mining node networks, the widest acceptance for goods and services and exchange of value, the most price stability, the most liquidity, the longest history of security in the real world against the most attacks.. these things are truly valuable and not easy to eclipse, and they are not just a piece of code.

So, he earned Bitcoin by providing a service. That's one way - work for it, though the person paying you has tax obligations on that money that they're legally obligated to report (and so do you, though neither of you have to specify the payment was in Bitcoin, you just need to report the income/expense etc.).

No problem.
Mempool congestion sucks, but it's only really been bad around huge events, like the segwit2x fork cancellation or this crazy run up where Coinbase/GDAX hit over $19k. Just like a week ago under 10 satoshi per byte was getting in the next block.
There was a huge disparity in Bitcoin price between exchanges so you have a bunch of people trying to race to perform arbitrage and scrape profits paying any fee to jump the line while tons of new retail buyers are getting coin and sending it through mediocre wallets that tend to overestimate fees (Coinbase) plus others worried about CBOE futures launching and paying high fees to get to the exchange to trade on those opening.

Nobody knows when this is. People sell every day worrying this is around the corner. Some people live off Bitcoin entirely, spending every day.

That doesn't make them right. That doesn't mean Bitcoin needs to change to suit their passionate beliefs.
Bigger block size is demonstrably not the best way to scale Bitcoin. Anyone who suggests that is disingenuous or clueless.
Bigger blocks are likely in the scaling roadmap, but they come with costs. Developers are being conservative, as they should. They only proposal for bigger blocks so far that has passed technical muster is segwit, and many people who do the actual engineering and have for years already see that as a compromise towards larger blocks than needed at this time.

He talks about latency increasing orphaned blocks which allow easier attacks on the network and leads to further miner centralization, which is already a huge problem in Bitcoin. Increasing block size makes it worse. Blocks do not need to be so big that they take minutes to transfer for increased orphans to be a problem.
They also talk about how the scaling bottleneck isn't transactions. It's user experience. Companies handling exchanges already cannot keep up with their increasing user base. They have no need for more transactions when they cannot responsibly handle the amount of people already using their system. Another centralization problem.


Which scales orders of magnitude rather than linearly. 2 to the power of x, instead of 2 times x. By further leveraging decentralization without sacrificing security. This makes a block size increase superfluous, bringing nothing but negatives.
Even if one thinks 2MB block size is appropriate, segwit2x is unacceptable. Miners and economic powers don't get to politically coerce changes to consensus rules. Period. If it is allowed, the idea of Bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:05:43
That is still the dream, and far from crushed.
Not every aspect of the system is going to grow in exact lock step with each other.
Look the course of 2017, Bitcoin's had an amazing bull year. Interest and adoption shot up. The additional users and demand for transactions outpaced the supply and consequently raised price of fees.
It takes time and effort to move each piece of the machinery forward. The fees are not so high that demand for transactions has dropped. Blocks are still full. People who find the utility higher than the cost are nowhere near exhausted.
This does price some people out for now, and it can be frustrating and result in some disillusionment, but there's a lot on the road map and a ton of ability to scale right in front of us.

I was a bit harsh, but open source folks - which bitcoin is - have a different ethos. If you want software to work a certain way, make it yourself. "Well, where's the solution?" comes off as exceptionally entitled and disrespectful of the work people put in to make the things you use for free.


Feel free to make your contribution to solve the scaling issues while keeping a $60B network safe and secure. Or go make your own software and do what Bitcoin got wrong better. Put up or shut up, as they say. Lightning Network is about to go live, plenty of opportunity to make something of value. Or are you just along for the ride hoping others make the value for you?

Did you read that though? He wants to lower it to 300KB and raise it back up to 1MB in 7 years:




Please, for yourself, dig deeper. This has already happened. How reasonable does this insistence on small blocks sound when high fees and unpredictable confirmation times (as well as features added by them that removed safe 0-conf transactions) have absolutely tanked user and merchant adoption over the last year.
Does Lightning Network sound like it aligns with this, or opposes it? (google the sentence if you don't know what it's from, I'll probably get banned if I link it, which is insane.

It's seen a spike in price today. It would be one of the better times to sell since the fork. HitBTC has 2 confirmation delay. Most other exchanges were higher, as much as 20 confirmations. Of course, that matters less now than it did right after the fork.

If I give you a gift worth $14k or more (talking about the usa here) you have to declare that (you still wouldn't pay taxes because the lifetime gift exclusion is much larger). It doesn't matter if it's USD, BTC, a car, or maple syrup.
What exactly you have to do depends on more information than we have here but the IRS doesn't ignore it because it's not USD. If I'm a US resident and get paid for a job in Euros, would you think I don't have to declare that income to the IRS? You do.

A transaction on the main chain needs to be made to open a channel. Once open, any number of transactions can occur across it.


Aside from a temporary liquidity risk, yes. If a channel is uncooperative, you have to wait for a time lock to expire for the funds to be released.
Here are a couple videos that go over how it works in more detail:

You can routinely trade fiat in for bitcoin as you spend to avoid that issue. But frankly, bitcoin is not particularly useful as a currency, especially for those living in a 1st world country. Usefulness as a currency isn't really what gives bitcoin value. It's the first decentralized network protocol for an unforgeable, unalterable, public ledger with a 9 nine year history of proven security in real life deployment (the largest bug bounty ever).
Things like segwit and Lightning Network show that we're still in the very early stages of even just figuring out what and how to build on this protocol.

This explanation doesn't hold any water. "Using" a thing is not "property." Lightning Network is not a "thing" that can be "property". Perhaps I misunderstand what you're trying to say, but it appears to be simply your opinion: 


Coins that are tied to a specific company has the same problem really, it's just a matter of time before instructions and gag orders hits their mailbox.
As far as I am concerned, when censorship resistance goes out the window, which it will, there is no point developing this technology anymore. It will have nothing to offer other than being an inefficient replacement of what we already have.
I hope I'm wrong, but I can't really see how.

Yes, nodes will earn fees. I'm no economist but it sounds like there will be plenty of market pressure for low fees. It's also completely feasible to run your own LN nodes and collect fees. It's an enormously useful feature to bring economic activity on board en masse. imho.

To be fair, for much of Bitcoin's history it was not known that something like Lightning Network would be needed to achieve this, or if it was known it was only known or foreseen by a few.
Bitcoin was often touted as being able to handle it all, all by itself.
That said, it obviously cannot do everything and scaling up orders of magnitude requires more than a larger block size.

Miners are the only group with broad *social* consensus on the change. Miners cannot be allowed to call the shots on *consensus rules* changes. Neither can a supermajority of miners plus a debatable majority of economic nodes. Period. Full stop. If they can, it isn't Bitcoin any longer.
Miners can be replaced. BTC chain can be protected. This segwit2x chain holds none of mine, or many others, trust.
If miners can force 2MB block size, I lose my trust that they couldn't in the future force any further changes, like lifting the 21M mined coins limit, or stopping the halvening of block rewards, or censoring transactions.
The presentation of the segwit2x proposal alone, from a strictly technical perspective, is clear evidence that the prospects of a coin under the development of that team (barely can even call it that) are dead.

The primary goals of Bitcoin are to give you sovereign control of your money and allow you to transact, peer to peer, securely, without trust, without permission, without censorship, with guarantee of delivery, with anonymity if you take precautions. To have fixed and reliable monetary policy. 
It sounds like you just listened to what people told you and didn't seek information on your own and now you think Bitcoin is supposed to do one thing - and it is supposed to do that (not free, but not expensive at least) - but it's primary goals are deeper.

The regulation in western countries has been mostly reasonable so far. Classifying it for tax purposes and around the transition to and from fiat. I agree zero regulation is not realistic and for situations where avoiding those regulations is needed other technologies might be used (Monero today, for example, maybe a sidechain in the future), and when adoption is high enough that regulated line between crypto and fiat will disappear as fiat does anyway, if we ever get that far.

@_date: 2017-08-23 04:39:56


It was never going to happen.
This is really the main problem I have with BCH, the narratives being pushed. The flippening, etc.
I think it's a big distraction from Bitcoin progress, divisive, and some people lost their shirts. 
But the market seems to have said that they value a coin tied to the Bitcoin name, with the same coin history, easily integrated, mostly responsibly forked from a technological pov, with big blocks for cheap transactions, and with the potential for a large mining pool if the market deems it valuable.
Cash is really the perfect name for it. It is like cash compared to Bitcoin being the Ft. Knox of digital gold. 
In the not too far off future we should have cash/cheap transactions handled by sidechains and LN, and in the meantime people can use Bitcoin Cash if it gets adopted where they need it, or any other coin if Bitcoin's fees are too high. This does make some services unfeasible at this time, but that's just where we are.
Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. Moneybadger still gonna moneybadger. It took a different stance favoring security. Bitcoin developers are conservative. This is as it should be. This is still immensely valuable in a world with Bitcoin Cash.
I think mining staying on BCH over the profitability ratio is good right now. It should lead to equilibrium more quickly, but there will always be bumps after any significant change of the price ratio between BTC and BCH. I think part of the lag we're seeing now is simply getting the tech set up. Auto-switching mining pools becoming more standard should help as well and those weren't in place a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:11:59




I imagine such high fees would pose a problem, or at least push strongly towards centralization of LN nodes.
Like you, I see fees *that* high as a problem. If high fees are more of a problem than the effects of increasing the blocksize, I believe increasing the blocksize will be revisited with much less contention (or some better solution will be found). Paying a few dollars, where fees are now, to open a channel doesn't seem like a problem. And paying a lower fee and waiting longer to open a channel doesn't seem like a problem.

It looked like this might be related, at least: 


So let's imagine LN is unpatented. Is this authority any more or less able to enforce this? I'm not sure that the patent makes them any more able to. Also not a lawyer, however.
Blockstream does have a [patent pledge]( to place all patents except those for hardware under the [Defensive Patent License](


How would Blockstream enforce it? Blockstream is under obligation to pursue legal action against users of the patented technology? If Blockstream didn't have the patent, wouldn't the central authority simply go after each user of the technology individually? I think that would be even more effective than proxying a legal challenge through a small company.
Just my thoughts. Patents should be a concern, but we should be able to reason out the implications. Some people here should be lawyers. I'll have to talk to a relative who works in patent law myself.

Most of the companies that signed the NYA agreement are financially backed by a single investment firm, Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group (DCG).

@_date: 2017-08-19 04:19:30
Correct. The development community has a lot more good ideas for improvements that could go into a hardfork if one is done, and it needs a longer roll out period even if it's as little as 2x with safety like replay protection that is not only missing but has been refused by the 2x developers. Bitcoin software is installed all over the world and we can see many nodes running versions that are years old. Segwit also needs more than 90 days to be observed before more changes to the protocol would be at all reasonable. This is a large, world wide network guarding $60 billion and segwit is a significant change. And of course allowing a small corporate group to dictate software functionality, **especially** changes to consensus rules, cannot be allowed to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:44:58
I'd say no. At this point I think there's a lot more people who continue to expect it to ultimately grow in value. I think we'll see less panic selling than in the past. 4 years ago, if it had dropped from $1k to a few hundred, I might have sold. Today, if it drops from $3500 to $1000-1500, I'm holding, and probably buying more.

segwit (not 2x) allows data in a block to be rearranged in a way that is estimated to effectively double the number of transactions in a block. This should be live on Wednesday, and as software is upgraded to utilize segwit more transactions will be in each block. Lots of software is ready to go already: 
Segwit2x would double the base block size in addition to that.
segwit expects block weight to be 1.7-2.1MB with a maximum of 4MB (only under certain conditions that are unlikely to be common).
segwit2x would expect block weights around 3.5MB with a maximum of 8MB (again, certain uncommon conditions)
One of the arguments against the current segwit2x proposal is that 90 days is not enough time after the segwit upgrade to properly analyze the effects on the network and determine the suitability of doubling the base block size. There are also other arguments against it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:24:53
That's the only way on the bitcoin blockchain, you'd have to work it out with the other party and they'd have to return it to you in a new transaction. You may be interested in Lightning Network. This allows parties to open a funded channel between them (or through intermediaries). Smart contracts I believe can also be written to only release funds under some conditions. Multisig can let you require multiple keys to send funds (useful for escrow).
I'm afraid I'm not well versed enough in those techs to go into more detail, but there are definitely technologies building on Bitcoin (and more coming with segwit) that allow for a cancellable transaction type scenario.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:21:28




Increasing the block size is on the top of their list.


Process and timing is about the difference between soft and hard forks. Also about making two significant changes to the network protocol in a short amount of time. Segwit is going to change the network dynamics. There needs to be time to observe and reason about those changes before pushing another change to the protocol with a base block size increase.

For me, the value in Bitcoin is forcing a re-evaluation of national and world wide monetary policy. On a personal level, it has drastically incentivized saving. I place value in technology that can take back power from incumbents and redistribute it to a wider populace. I see billions of people in the world who could contribute to the advancement of humanity but lack access to resources and I value making those resources more accessible to those people.
The system of governance we've created, especially in my country, disgusts me and this is a rare opportunity to shift the direction of our entire society.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:22:35
Perhaps, but as you said bitcoin is far from ideally distributed and decentralized and improvements that can be made with forks can help remedy that. Is it better to let bitcoin be bitcoin if that means it dies on the vine? I think there's enough people firmly on one ideological side or the other that forks, and contentious ones, were inevitable.

It's barely been tested at all. There's a testnet running btc1 but it's been running for a month or two. A year is a realistic deployment timeline for a hard fork.
The blockchain is already problematically large. The most important properties of Bitcoin are secure and trustless. Speed and transaction capacity ranks far behind those. They mean nothing if Bitcoin is not unfailingly secure. Larger block sizes directly reduce security and decentralization. 1MB is not an insignificant amount in this context. 1MB on every single block, every 10 minutes, forever.
It's a hard line. A fair number of developers want to lower it even further. segwit (not 2x) is already considered a compromise as it will already effectively raise the block size to an expected average just under 2MB with a maximum of just under 4MB.
segwit2x intends to double it again to 4MB/8MB and to do so only 90 days after segwit deploys. That's where the developers reply LOL. It's absurd. A responsible engineer would never make those changes that close together and would only deploy a hard fork in that short of time in a dire emergency.
A straight block size increase isn't even a solution. 5 years? That's, no offense, laughable. The blocks are full today because of miner's generating spam to purposefully fill up the blocks because it benefits them financially by driving up competition for space and consequently fees. 
The spam transactions are not difficult to see. For a couple of days around when NYA was announced, they stopped. The mempool was empty, fees were low, everything was great. But it was quickly clear segwit2x would not be accepted as is and the spam started again. If the block size was simply raised a bit, it seems quite likely they would be full of spam again in short order. I've seen estimates of a couple months to a year at most.
And block size increases only scale linearly. If we want to talk Visa scale, Bitcoin needs to scale exponentially. If 7 billion people on the planet made 2 transactions a day, that would take 24GB blocks, 3.5TB a day, 1.27 Petabytes a year.
Developers see essentially no benefit, very very little, and plenty of downside.
I get things suck right now. Growing pains. The same miners spamming the network have also been playing political games to prevent segwit from getting activated unless they got bigger blocks too. The developers aren't playing that came. They aren't going to capitulate to corporate self interest to the detriment of Bitcoin. They threatened to perform a user activated fork and effectively fire the miners. That's why segwit was agreed to, and then they produced this NYA agreement for segwit2x that stated they would activate segwit and then double the block size 90 days later.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:15:57
Yes of course. Electrum X changed their code so that the Bitcoin Cash chain was the default mainnet, and you had to switch the setting to be on the Bitcoin actual main chain.
Someone could've not noticed and installed that code on their server, and then my Electrum wallet might have connected to them, unknown to me, and now I'm on a different chain.
I was showing that your statement was a very real concern.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:10:03


At this point in time.
Tell me, which chain is performing more proof of work since the split? Is BTC outpacing BCH, or is BCH outpacing BTC? What would happen if BTC had some trouble getting enough hash power to keep producing more blocks? How stupid does that EDA look now?

Yes. Also, as the amount of value represented by bitcoin increases, the volatility will decrease. Right now all bitcoin is considered worth like $60 billion. That's actually a very small amount in context. If bitcoin was worth $1 trillion you would see fluctuations that were a much smaller percent of the total. It's also still [in the initial part of an exponential adoption curve](

@_date: 2017-08-10 09:34:15


Right. If btc1 had put their proposed changes through the rigorous review and testing deserved and Core was refusing to support it without sufficiently valid reasoning it would be a different story.
At that point I'd likely argue they were eroding the ecosystem (though I'd still argue that having a large group of hash power also in charge of development and without a proven history of development would be a huge problem). At this point I argue they are taking the appropriate position to try and protect it.

You know, that's a fair point, and I've perhaps over simplified to the point of pushing a "it's DCG" narrative too far.
My main intention was to point people to discussion deeper than I can provide myself in the midst of the large FUD campaign that seemed to be going around yesterday.


I would say that while a few Core devs work for Blockstream, dozens of other regular contributors do not and Core devs by and large *strongly* oppose 2x.


Yeah, yeah, not the first time this has been leveled at me on this account. Look, people use alts. I haven't been engaging in crypto discussion here on reddit and I wasn't about to start and mention any holdings I might have under my other couple main accounts. I have a few strong of areas of interest and I tend to use a different account for each for better anonymity. This is the only alt I discuss crypto with. I'm a real person who invests in crypto, and not just for the potential to make money, which I won't deny, but also because I *strongly* support the larger societal goals of the cryptocurrency movement.
I would not call myself some Core fanatic. I don't agree with everything they do, and I can see truth in arguments from the other side of the scaling debate, but what's going on with BCH is kind of ridiculous and regular people are getting sucked in and likely going to get pumped and dumped on. This is nothing new from Ver and crew.

There was something called the New York Agreement where a bunch of power players in the Bitcoin space agreed to support segwit2x to keep the parties who wanted different methods of scaling Bitcoin together, rather than splitting.
However, you may have heard that Bitcoin Cash forked off of Bitcoin on Aug 1. I personally believe that since that happened, there will no longer be any real push for segwit2x and no fork will happen.
Segwit (not 2x) has been locked in and will go live on the Bitcoin network in about 9 days.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:45:45
The NYA was probably intended to prevent BCH. Since that happened, none of the remaining NYA signatories are going to be interested in further splitting.

I think the opposite. Bitcoin comes out stronger after every trial and now it's starting to have happened enough times that people have caught on and hold through the turbulence.

@_date: 2017-08-21 08:46:49


Agreed. A dynamic and deterministic block size increase mechanism would have a better chance of gaining support than segwit2x. I don't see this as a reason to accept segwit2x now.


That's fair. I got a bit hyperbolic.

 is the implementation that everyone currently trusts. Regardless of how it's framed some limited number of persons has authority to commit to that repository. Why would those persons be beholden to an agreement made entirely by other parties. I don't see them saying never, either, just that the timeframe and the current state of the segwit2x implementation are not ready and deploying them would be irresponsible.
If  won't merge segwit2x, people are free to choose to use  But it's a hard fork. Good luck going back if development switches to that repository. Do we all trust moving control of commits to the active bitcoin repo to this other person(s)?

@_date: 2017-08-17 04:53:53
And even if they did there's a lot more people these days who would fully expect the price to recover and more so I doubt the crash would be as hard. It would take a more significant event than Mt Gox in today's context to cause a similar price depression.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:12:03
A hard fork has a long roll out period. Doing one for just 2x would be a large waste of engineering resources, and right when we just got lightning network. Good luck getting any devs to even think about 2x right now haha.
I think there's block space optimizations and fixes on the road map that need to happen in a hard fork. It just wouldn't make sense to do 2x before tackling the clear optimizations to space usage first.
There also has to be a fee market - less supply than demand. Miners need to earn fees. They do get block rewards now, but those are dwindling and fees should ramp up over time to take their place. And if there's excess space and a price near zero it will just fill up with low value transactions that aren't worth a higher fee, and then the block chain carries that forever. 
If size is raised, what we're likely to get is right back to the same place in short order because there is more demand. We're just going to bring twice as many people along in each block.
Right now is particularly bad because of BCH. The mining pool is switching 30% or so of the hash power to mine it in a cycle. It'll almost all be mining BTC for a day, and then it switches over and squeezes blocks out of BCH like crazy for a day slowing the BTC blocks down and leading to unusually high backlogs.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:38:47

I agree. They were put in to allow a mechanism for upgrade when the majority of nodes agree.
Two problems.
1. A contentious fork is a form of attack on the original network. That's reality. If it can happen, it will. Consensus is there to deal with it, as long as the network doesn't succumb to a 51% attack.
2. Nodes, with regards to consensus, are far to centralized. There was never originally any notion of a non-mining node. The idea was that many or most users would operate a fully validating and mining node. This would properly decentralize decisions on consensus to a broad base of heterogeneous parties. Technology happened, ASICs happened, and this is essentially broken in Bitcoin today.

Blocks would cease to be found and transactions would halt. Developers would probably create an emergency hard fork to change perhaps the Proof of Work or difficulty adjustment so that mining could restart.

They are also weaknesses. It would be cheap to dump hundreds of GB's into the BCH chain that it would then have to carry forever. BTC has experienced this issue before (not to that scale though).

If that's the way it goes Bitcoin is worth a lot less than people currently think it is.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:15:42


I completely agree with that. It's noise and doesn't represent the people who matter, in my humble opinion.


Let them present their case in the proper development space like the mailing list where technological changes are properly vetted by other technological experts in the space.
Non-technical user opinion has little weight, especially to *change* the status quo, to change the consensus rules, to require a hard fork.
Security is paramount. The main part of the value proposition, and I'll say in my opinion - but the developers I believe would agree - is not the transaction throughput and low fees - but the security and immutability of the chain. 
The developers are considering well into the future when Bitcoin might *seriously* challenge the existing power structures and the attacks it might have to face from coordinating superpowers.
Demand for space on the blockchain is all but endless. Whatever block size we increase to will likely fill up right away. And then we need to store that forever. They are thinking about things like how long it will take to spin up nodes on a makeshift network because the internet is no longer a viable option. Doomsday scenarios. It may seem like overkill today, and not worth the losses now from high fees and limited space. But what if this all really succeeds and 20 years from now that 8MB block bites us all in the ass hard.
And even today, bandwidth in Australia makes running a verifying node quite costly. Increasing the blocksize would immediate exacerbate the issue. As a miner, larger blocks can also increase orphan rates, making it harder to compete against the bigger miners.
What concerns you about the current block size (honestly curious, if you care to share)?

Common theme with a particular development group.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:13:44
I honestly don't mean to insult you or anything like that, but consider carefully if you're technically informed enough to have a valid opinion.
There's a process in place for suggesting, debating, and including changes to Bitcoin that has been in place for years and has served the system well. There's an appropriate method. segwit2x did not follow this.
Now it is open source, anyone can fork the repository, make the changes they want, and say hey everyone use this. That's essentially what's happening. Except the segwit2x change has been coded by one single developer who from the looks of it (you can view the repositories) cannot even hope to keep up with the other work being done in the main Bitcoin repository, and nearly all of the companies supporting segwit2x are all under the umbrella of the Barry Silbert Digital Currency Group.
Do you think that's what you want bitcoin to be? A system where one single person was able to take control and dictate changes to their benefit. So segwit2x might not fundamentally destroy bitcoin, but what about the next change they make? What kind of precedent does it set?
With regards to the timeline, there's economically important nodes that haven't been upgraded in years. A hard fork ejects them from the network.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:34:01


I feel like it's worth pointing out (not to you but to anyone reading) that it shouldn't be necessary (and currently is not necessary) to trust developers in this system. (You and I are sort of using "trust" in different contexts here - you're saying we shouldn't transfer development of bitcoin to developer(s) who haven't demonstrated trustworthiness, which I agree with)
Development has proceeded in the open for the entirety of Bitcoin's life, and anyone is able to verify what the code is doing. There's an open process for all to see the suggestion, debate, and possible inclusion of changes to Bitcoin.
If the /btc1 repository ends up taking over and becoming the software everyone uses, who's to say they don't take that repository private at some later date? Do you or I trust them not to do something like that?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:24:45
There's a lot of normal variance around 10 minutes, though. It wouldn't be that unusual for several times that to pass without a block, or for several to be found in short succession.
Still gives a better idea than daily though, thanks.

TCP/IP would be the most commonly recognizable layer underneath. TCP/IP is also Bitcoin's base layer.
HTTP &amp; Bitcoin would be Layer 7 on the OSI Model. TCP is Layer 4. IP is Layer 3. MAC is Layer 2. Layer 1 is copper, fibre, and electromagnetic radiation.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:48:15


Huge problem. Totally agree. I think a large part of it is on social media, and at least not in the actual technical forums of discussion like the mailing list. Problem is, it's here that bleeds into the mainstream media.
I hate to be finger pointing and blaming, and maybe some people really honestly believe they just have a better idea and are trying to realize it, but it looks an awful lot like some unethical bad actors trying to enrich themselves at *everyone* else's expense, short and long term. It's very frustrating to watch. I think know astroturfing when I see it, and believe lot of the noise isn't from real people with real opinions.


I don't want to assume, but did you know that segwit which is activating today will increase effective block size by roughly 1.7-2x? Transactions have to be sent with new segwit supporting software but I expect we'll see the large players rolling that out in short order.
Segwit has a maximum size of 4MB, though it's unlikely to reach that in real world usage.
It is already a compromise from 1MB, developers didn't want to increase it at all. Segwit2x aims to double that to an average of 4MB and a max of 8MB. One of the main arguments against it from the developers is that 90 days after segwit is just not enough time to even stage a upgrade hard fork across the whole ecosystem much less make any reasoned decisions that account for the changes to the network operating state from segwit.
I also think there's a serious question of whether or not delaying scaling solutions is costing too much in lost mover advantage. But that's practically water under the bridge as segwit finally got approved by everyone and brings a block size increase with it.
Segwit included the fix needed to build better scaling solutions like Lightning Network. It's still going to be a while before LN is usable and adding to adoption, though.
Segwit2x isn't scheduled to November. We can all continue to consider the possibilities and merits of each direction to take, and we can see how segwit plays out for reducing fees right now.
The last question I'll put forth to consider, is there any shortage of people willing to pay the current fees? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:22:12
But it is worth not appearing like those trolls to people new to this debate.

Yep. They silently add about 0.5% to market price (right their own dashboard even) when you buy, and they also subtract about 0.5% from market price when you sell.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:59:01
Too bad they'll have to upgrade to try and follow Lightning Network now. Their problem just got more difficult by an order of magnitude. Now excuse me while I go download some torrents and browse the darknet.

Believe me, they have a fair share of my frustration. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:24:23
I appreciate the convo, it certainly keeps me reconsidering my position.
I think the only place I mentioned exchanges is that some people would say (I don't necessary have a strong opinion on this) the exchanges - the on ramps and off ramps for fiat to and from bitcoin - are already overwhelmed. They would say the experience people have on those on and off ramps is very important to wider user adoption. They would resist lower fees as a reason to increase block size because that would exacerbate the shortage of customer support on/off ramp companies are already struggling with.
I've heard it not as the primary reason to oppose a block size increase, but as supporting reason for that particular concern.
I still think the main argument against a block size increase is still the everlasting burden on the blockchain.
This thread popped up today that has more discussion about the potential ramifications of that: 
I do also see the fees as a problem, and I see Bitcoin having lost a lot of marketshare and first mover advantage.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:39:39


Mt Gox was a big part of that correction. Bitcoin has entered the public consciousness a lot more in the interim. It would take something even larger and more significant than Mt Gox was in 2014 to cause the same amount of pull back now.

BCC has less than 10% of hashrate.

I don't think Miners have any interest in murder-suiciding Bitcoin as a whole. ViaBTC's position, for example:




@_date: 2017-08-19 00:09:59
BCH is an effort by Roger Ver and he's slandering BTC all over social media and claiming BCH will kill BTC and become "Bitcoin," plus this run up looks a lot like a classic pump and dump, and Ver has a history of doing this (Classic, Unlimited). The selling is a side effect of that so not an attack in and of itself but I would say yeah, part of one.

Channels are supposed to be long lived. If you used them this way you'd be needlessly wasting money. I imagine the person who can't afford a surprise $100 bill won't do that. Plus software will make it the default. We're a ways away from that. But when that's developed you'll just swipe your iPad and it'll all happen in the background. Email in the early 90's vs. email today.
The idea is for LN nodes to form a flat mesh network. Think 6 degrees of separation. Software will find a path through the available nodes to your destination.
In a world where Bitcoin is ubiquitous enough that transaction fees are hundreds of dollars LN nodes should be everywhere. Your employer could pay you directly in them and pay the cost to open and close the channel. Merchants and service providers could find other business models that pay for those costs for users of the node. Anyone with some capital has a business opportunity to be a LN node. HODL now and get your BTC earning you even more interest later ;)
It's possible with enough adoption that you could live your entire life with only a handful of LN channels and never touch fiat again and never pay a main chain transaction fee yourself.
And if things go tits up you ultimately still have total control of all your Bitcoin.
And again, the option of increasing the blocksize still exists and if high fees are actually a problem I fully believe the development team will address that. It's about risk analysis at the current time and into the future. Current fees are just not an issue. A couple bucks on the high end to open a LN channel is fine and since there's usually no rush you can elect to pay a smaller fee for a slower confirmation. Space on the block chain is a valuable commodity. There is already at this point in cryptocurrency essentially unlimited demand at a price of 0.
We also have segwit coming which will provide about 1.7x the space for transactions. There's a number of further block size efficiency features on the roadmap that were all held up by segwit activation. All of that should lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:21:16
BTC has backed off 10% from an all time high and just saw pretty strong support at $4k pushing it back up to 4100. There's a lot of FUD going around BCH and further uncertainty about segwit2x.
BCH is having some affect on price but not all that much. BTC will come out stronger like each time before and future attempts will have less and less success.

@_date: 2017-08-28 21:42:47


Of course, you'll think only a handful of miners support big blocks and that this won't apply.
Or you'll tell me BTC has the longest chain and fail to notice which direction each chain's length is tending towards. Or forget that if one chain loses a lot of hash power it could quickly fall behind.
Don't worry, miners want everyone to get filthy rich, and that includes keeping the chain secure and enforcing the rules that really matter.

Sell Bitcoin Cash and buy Bitcoin
BCH is a joke, a sham, and an insult. It's a thinly veiled attempt by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu to bilk people out of money or otherwise serve only their own ends.
They may have long term plans for the coin or they may not. So, you might find yourself at the mercy of miners and big players dumping a bunch and crashing the price. Or you might just find yourself sitting on a coin that's going absolutely nowhere and slowly bleeding money.
There are people who are sitting here slowly selling off their BCH because they have *so* much that the market can't absorb them. And there's piles more BCH waiting to get dumped like Coinbase's distribution that's still yet to come.
The price of BCH is going to keep going down. It would require more artificial pumping to bring it back up, and Ver and crew have to have spent millions already propping it up.
The developers made a huge mistake. They couldn't reason about the effects of their changes on the system. What hope does that give anyone for the future of that coin?
BCH has no integration anywhere. Is that coming in the next weeks, months? I know what the other sub will say, but do you really buy it? Who's going to take it seriously at this point and spend effort to integrate it?
Holding BCH is a risk. It didn't cost you anything to get, but you can get a decent amount of money for it now. What's your BCH going to be worth in a 6 months or a year if you hold it? What about BTC? 
Don't buy into the BS. Bitcoin Cash is a giant pile of BS and an utter embarrassment. It's dead, it just doesn't know it yet. Use this opportunity to increase your holdings of BTC.

Also, as a miner, transitioning from block rewards to transaction fees is probably going to present challenges.

You got one part right.
I cannot recommend this nor in good conscience provide any information on how to "get in". Seriously, you should do a lot more research before you put any money into that.
That said, if you owned BTC prior to Aug 1, you also own the same amount of BCH (BCC on some exchanges but there is another coin also labeled BCC in places). It is simple to separate the two and sell off your BCH while it's in this little price bump.

Here are some of the arguments against raising the block size. Not saying I agree or disagree, just presenting one of the developers views:
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:47:47
Except there will be a million Bob's competing instead of Visa, MC, Amex, BoA, Wells, and a handful of others. One might offer lower fees to track data, another will offer higher fees for more anonymity. In this still far off future, one might very well get paid to allow data tracking. Let's be real, a blockchain transaction fee being more than a person buying coffee can afford ever period is a long, long ways away. Payment channels can stay open for years. Network effect might mean you almost never need to settle a transaction on the blockchain. If adoption becomes ubiquitous your employer will likely pay you by funding a well networked channel. Atomic chain swaps can happen. Other chains exist right now if you think this Bitcoin isn't what you want. Or suggest a better solution. Larger blocks are not a solution to this problem.

Coinbase charges 1.99% on bank transfer payments and 3.99% on credit card payments.
They also tack on a 0.5%-1% increase in the bitcoin price over what you'll see on the exchanges or even on their dashboard. For example, right now this moment BTC is $3300.95 on an exchange and $3309.30 on Coinbase's Dashboard page. But, if I go to Coinbase's buy page the price is $3325.85.
I don't know much about their wallet services, but the history of Bitcoin is littered with places like Coinbase that went bust, got hacked, or robbed their customers. It is always recommended to store your Bitcoin in a wallet that you control the private keys to.

Of course. I'm a dev, I get it. People who can do that know where to find it. 99.95% of people here are not capable of that. I think the discourse here - what the broader public sees, and how they understand Bitcoin -
 still matters, even if it will never affect the implementation. 
There are a lot of totally irredeemable trolls and shills. I'd rather drown them out with useful discussion than point everyone towards the door. Just my opinion.
Because many of the others are just people who are excited about bitcoin. Even some of the ones talking hard forks and what have you. They came around here and saw a big war. They don't know enough to understand the decisions or see through the shouting. They pick a side as best they can and then participate. Often in a very misguided way, though, and I totally despise the BS from the irredeemable, too.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:52:00
Just google something like "biggest dark net markets busted" and you'll see. I'd name them or link but I'm not sure right off hand if that's against any rules in this sub.
Also, regarding why spend BTC on the regular market.. One strategy is to buy with BTC to support the market but immediately (or before even) replace your BTC. Though, there's likely tax implications to that strategy.
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:44:16
Well hopefully this war stays cold and miners collude to keep everything functioning smoothly, like they did with the EDA oscillations, and let each Bitcoin target their respective markets on their own merits. Seems like that would be in their best long term interests with regards to profit.
Plus the miners want big blocks. Seems like the main chain is more at risk from that perspective. Why reorg the chain you lobbied for.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:03:07
The only reason blocks are full is because of constant spam transactions. If those weren't being sent, there wouldn't be a blocksize issue. If blocksize is increased, there's no reason to believe the space wouldn't simply be filled with more spam.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:15:36
If people weren't willing to pay the fees to make their transaction, demand would fall and so would the fee.
Since that is not the case, it appears obvious that the fee is worth the cost to enough people, but I totally understand how that sucks if it means you get priced out.
BCH is stealing supply this week too, driving the fees up a bit more.

My guess? Enough people in the government actually want to kill the Federal Reserve at this point. It might also be the only way out from an enormous economic collapse from currency inflation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:48:12
They will. There are more features besides a block size increase that require a hard fork. Since a hard fork has a high cost of rollout compared to a soft fork, it makes sense to include more features at once. I believe at least one feature if not a couple will also optimize storage in the block so that should definitely get implemented before increasing block size.
Also, lightning network enables so much more than a block size increase. It would be silly to divert resources towards a 2x hard fork right now.

Including yourself


@_date: 2017-08-24 19:58:18


Quite the opposite, in fact. A coin's value, especially in this case with SHA256 coins with an already existing large mining pool, gives it hashrate.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:08:59


Because the original developers saw the problems with leaving it larger. Who's to say they wouldn't have made it even smaller had they better predicted where things went? They didn't forsee ASIC mining. Bitcoin is vulnerable to the current mining setup.


Go look at the blocks of BCH. No one is using it, they are small. It's been in existence for all of 3 weeks. Check back in a year or few.


Node counts where? Is it ok if it takes a month, or a year, to initially sync the blockchain? Is that "secure enough"? I have a fast connection, it took almost 2 days and blew me threw my bandwidth cap for the month. What will it be in a year or 5 or 30? Network speed doesn't increase like drive space, and transistors are hitting hard physical limits. We can't make them smaller than an atom. Who gets to decide to change it from the status quo that's been working since day 1? What bar of justification should they meet? Do you know what upload bandwidth in Australia costs?
The original intention of Bitcoin is that *everyone* would run a fully verifying and hashing node. We've already lost security by deviating from that. Possibly fatal. We don't know yet.


They do. Just a few pools comprise like 90% of the hashrate and they're all doing whatever they can to "cheat" or simply make as much money as they can. This expectation is built into Bitcoin. Rational miners.


How? By keeping pressure on the market for space in blocks by not opening it up beyond what is needed for natural demand. This is how you use the market to price out spam when a large portion of miners are all playing the same game.
Other people will say that there's no need because the scaling bottleneck isn't the network, it's the ecosystem. Coinbase, bittrex, polonex, etc. can't scale their customer service to handle the current user load. If we make it technologically easy to onboard more users before those business have scaled to meet that demand, it erodes at the system through negative public perception. Now, many with that opinion would say we're at a point where Bitcoin risks first mover advantage by keeping the status quo, but developers have been trying to get exponential scaling past a greedy cabal of miners for 2 years.

@_date: 2017-08-23 22:15:53
It's going to take some time for software to get polished and nodes to get deployed. But a lot of activity is through central hubs like exchanges, Coinbase, BitPay, merchants so they can get a lot of traffic onto LN's to relieve fees and congestion if they implement it.
Segwit that activates today also increases the amount of transactions that can be processed as that software is adopted into wallets, which is very simple compared to implementing LN.

One side didn't sign this agreement. Why would they be bound to it?
One side got together and said we want all of the bitcoin economy to do this and we are doing it with our developer instead of the team that has successfully guided the bitcoin project from inception to where it is today.
The other side said no. The implementation is poor, it isn't necessary, it hasn't been thoroughly vetted and carries too much risk.
But now it's expected the core developers will incorporate 2X?

Interesting. I watched the rise of ASICs (nearly bought one, but figured I'd get scammed out of it, non-delivery, etc) but GPU mining was already well established when I learned of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:32:37
I lurk a lot and that's not the sense I get. I see a good majority wanting to heal the divide and move forward in unity and that often comes as support for 2x, but I also see a large number of people who understand the technical details (unlike most of those who just want to get back to agreeing) raise seemingly valid reasons to oppose 2x on the currently proposed timeline. I'm also not so sure the 2x part was all that important to the miners who didn't fork to BCH and the NYA agreement was more an agreement to move forward with Core and avoid the UASF.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:43:18
Yeah, where the state of mining ended up at this point is a serious risk to Bitcoin. Can we get some nation states in on this please? A handful or two of ideologically opposed countries running hash farms should make collusion a lot harder.

It might be helpful if there were more voices from miners in the community so everyone could better understand what would help make them successful. All we hear around here is they're from China, and centralized. Easy to demonize under that narrative.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:27:35
That is true, it was billed as being able to do everything, but that was perhaps irrational exuberance and optimism. On-chain transactions just cannot scale to that size while retaining bitcoin's security.
Perhaps a better way to frame it is that Bitcoin is Ft. Knox and something like Bitcoin Cash is your wallet.
The only way for bitcoin to also be your wallet is through layer 2 scaling. Hopefully in the not too distant future that will be through sidechains and lightning networks.

@_date: 2017-08-10 05:01:39
The resistance to 2x is because of poor implementation (things like a lack of replay protection) and a rushed timeline that hasn't allowed for proper vetting, along with a lack of need now that bcash forked and spam congestion seems to have dropped plus segwit will provide some more breathing room immediately, before 2nd layer solutions are deployed. There's also other desirable features that if a hard fork is going to happen would be good to include after a longer development and testing cycle. At least, that's how I understand it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:54:47

As someone who's been on these subs waaaaay too much in recent weeks (I started buying BTC 8 weeks ago, most after the Aug 1 fork, and went from 0 to a few BTC) it is soooo obvious to see the massive uptick in trolling here in the last 24 hours.
I also noticed that right after the Aug 1 fork this sub was oddly clear and empty and a lot of the threads at that time had some really good discussion, even compassing multiple sides from big block, segwit, 2x.

Huh? These words don't even make sense. LN is and only can be a protocol layered over (built on top of, by using) the blockchain.

I'd say you have it entirely backwards. Bigger blocks didn't happen on their own technical merit. Segwit did, but miners threatened a chain split and defection of hash power if segwit went through because it disabled ASIC boost.

I think it's a great time to get in. Segwit is going to activate in a week and change. You can say that's priced in and it is but the developments following on its heels probably aren't so much. People worry about segwit2x but I've been following it closely and my opinion's worth less than the electrons used to transmit it but I would bet it's going to be a total non-event (i.e. not happen) and if that's the case it'll remove another big chunk of uncertainty.
And let's say the split does happen. Better to get in now so you hold both sides of that fork. The market resolved the last one quickly and total value across both is 7-10% higher than pre-fork BTC. Yes I know sw2x could be more disruptive, but we might be surprised by the market's efficiency in sorting it out.
It's still steamrolling. So many more people have no intention of selling and are waiting on any dip to get more in.

Curious, isn't it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:03:36
Developers are more conservative in accepting risks, especially risks to security, from a technical analysis not from an analysis of "how different is this from the whitepaper".
Blocksize changes have measurable effects: 


Simple in what way and why is it preferable?


Define disruptive. What changes on the development roadmap are disruptive?


Is ultimately a dead end. Blocks would have to be prohibitively huge to accommodate widespread adoption with every single transaction on-chain. Petabytes per year of growth with everyone making just 2 transactions a day.
This is also an example of the developers being conservative by not taking on the negatives (some permanent) of a larger blocksize for a temporary improvement in transaction throughput. They choose to be careful to preserve security, thinking well into the future, which in my opinion is much more inline with the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto's ideas. How important are the implementation details compared to the essential purposes of Bitcoin?
Bitcoin *was* long billed as the thing you could use to send any amount of money anywhere cheaply. That is completely true. It is understandable if someone's upset that Bitcoin isn't that, or if they no longer want to support or use it. I don't know if that was excessive optimism or a lack of foresight, but it turns out it's simply not feasible to provide for all of our transactions on-chain while maintaining the strong security guarantees Bitcoin has held from its inception through today.
Those guarantees are overkill for the reality we live in today. Bitcoin is still small. It doesn't pose a threat to fiat money systems in the near term. Governments have a good regulatory handle on the on-ramps and off-ramps between fiat and crypto. When adoption steamrolls, and we can live our lives without touching the fiat world - when Bitcoin poses a *real* threat to the economic powers. That is when we need to be truly secure from attack on a serious scale. If that's a decade or a few from now, and the world powers coordinate to wage an attack on the network, will we regret a decision today to increase the blocksize? Core developers are just saying better safe than sorry, plus we have a really good idea of how to provide those cheap, fast, secure, unforgeable, unalterable transactions for every purpose - secured by the Bitcoin main blockchain, just not all of them individually on-chain.
What's the benefit of storing your coffee purchase forever as an individual transaction on the blockchain anyway? You wouldn't drive a Brinks truck to go get a cup of coffee, would you?
I see plenty of room for BCH &amp; BTC to co exist. They now have different target markets, and there is a significant and growing market for each. Look at the market cap BCH added to crypto as a whole! Why does it even matter if one is more "right" then the other. Use the one that suits your needs, and maybe don't close your eyes to alternatives that might meet a different need better. I think the name Bitcoin Cash is perfect, and maybe in the future it will be reconnected to Bitcoin through a sidechannel so everyone can have the benefits of both working together.

A situation where a majority of miners hopped over to another chain because of a small differential in profitability based on current prices would result in a loss of trust that would reduce the value of both chains likely far beyond where they are today, ultimately reducing miner profits.
A rational miner wouldn't rock the boat like this and risk capsizing the whole thing.
Also, the BCH chain hasn't really come close to being more profitable at all, and it's been getting less profitable the last couple days.

There's some resistance to block size but a lot of the resistance currently is to rushing forward with forks that are not sufficiently planned, implemented, and vetted - especially since network congestion is now down and segwit activating soon should further reduce congestion. There's just no need to rush forward with something like segwit2x. It's an unnecessary risk. I think Core development is right to pump the brakes and ensure due diligence is done on upgrades to a $50bn network. I don't hear many people saying never, just not now and not this implementation. We need the checks and balances, and while it's been a bit messy, frankly I think it's working.

The developers left it out on purpose because, get this, they were concerned there might be issues and they only wanted people who knew how to do it manually to be able to.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:50:52


That's a really good thing to question.
It seems like a lot of people do find it to have a use case. Even as a currency there are very large markets where the current transaction fees are minuscule compared to what is available through traditional banking. Western Union, for example. 
The security is also a big part of the value proposition. It's history being the largest honeypot target ever and never being broken or double spending a transaction or any other security breach. The care that the development team takes to ensure that security now and far into the future.
Lightning Network is what will bring the cheap and fast transactions. Is the longer time it's taking to get that working costing Bitcoin it's first mover advantage? Maybe. That's very hard to analyze. It's completely fair to question that and to have a different opinion.
This is all still a big experiment. It's why we all say don't invest more than you can afford to lose.


I'd say that would require intent, that some people are intentionally deceiving. Most of us, and I would suggest the core developers too, especially, believe in Bitcoin and want it to succeed, and sincerely believe they're taking the best way forward.
I like to read the [development mailing list]( I get a *much* better idea of what changes are happening and why and what factors were considered to come to those decisions than you'll find around here. They are smart engineers trying to solve difficult problems, not malicious, and not unaware of economic implications of technical decisions. I'm a software developer myself.

It's a smaller market than BTC that can more easily be manipulated. Just because it has a high market cap doesn't mean it has much liquidity. I'm no day trader so I could be way off base but the price of BCH when you look at things like the floor on the initial dump and the sudden spike yesterday do not at all look like natural price movements.

It's only gone down 10% from an all time high, and along with the BCH drama there's renewed segwit2x drama. 20x = 5%. Seems about right. It's also not just his 40k but everyone else who is betting on BCH following.

@_date: 2017-08-20 09:56:14


Funny, because the story up until just in the last few hours was that it would happen in a big ol hurry just as soon as the profitability tilted in favor of BCH.
It's already been "more profitable" to mine BCH for almost 2 days. 60% more wasn't enough, but 140% is?


At the rate BCH is popping out blocks they will have had a drastic upwards difficulty adjustment by then, returning mining profitability strongly to BTC.
Then BCH will be the slow chain until EDA rules kick in again. Sounds stable. If I was a miner with millions of capital expenditure and significant ongoing costs I'd sure be in a hurry to jump on that /s
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:32:37


It really is. The split occurred between founding members of Bitcoin, and they all have some valid points. I had a lot of doubt about segwit as a soft fork and it still concerns me some. The censorship on forums was a major public relations mistake. Core developers aren't perfect. I think I can understand how their roadmap makes the economics of mining very uncertain.
It just comes back to having real money secured in the system, and I want a system that uses true consensus and code to enforce the rules and isn't susceptible to these types of political manipulation. That first, and we'll figure out the profitability for miners, it's completely essential too.
Thanks again.

I can't disagree with you there. I just think the argument that segwit2x has issues and is rushed and not necessary on this time frame has merit. It also seems like a chunk of the most divisive of those wanting larger blocks left. How much of the NYA support was hoping to appease that faction and keep all of bitcoin together? How many are actually running btc1 or just signalling to stay compatible while things progress. There's a lot of testing of checks and balances going on.


I'd also suggest that without continuation under  bitcoin is not compelling. I think it would destroy too much trust in the system.
It seems like mutually assured destruction for a majority hash power and the core development group to split.

Right there for anyone to see - a block size increase is at the top of the list of items Core would put in a hard fork. Segwit2x is a dictate from corporate interests that cannot be allowed, the implementation is poor and misses all of the other useful features that could go into a hard fork. Hard forks should not be taken lightly and there is nowhere near enough justification in segwit2x to go through one. Segwit already constitutes a significant change to the network dynamics and the timeline of segwit2x does not allow for observing and reasoning about those changes before making further changes to the protocol. It also does not allow a reasonable amount of time for testing and deployment of the hard fork.
It's a total non-starter. No one in their right mind would go for segwit2x unless they have nefarious motivations.

@_date: 2017-08-23 11:28:30
I'm glad you're looking for understanding.


I totally get where you're coming from. Fees suck and they hurt adoption. Slow confirmation times suck and make some use cases infeasible. Some retailers have already stopped accepting Bitcoin because of this. Some Bitcoin businesses have gone under because of this. We don't get to live the full dream today, or next year even. We're *way* early on this train. Innovators. It isn't even early adopters yet.
It's not the drive space that's the issue. It's bandwidth, mainly upload bandwidth, that is the main bottleneck for size.
So what if someone does attack Bitcoin 20 years from now and we all need to start spinning up nodes to replace the network? 
Sync'ing the whole chain already takes several hours on really fast connections to a day or several on a good high speed cable connection. This decision today for 8MB or the roughly 1.7MB with segwit, well, multiply that by one full block every 10 minutes from now until then and you have to push all of that data across the network to spin up a node. 
An attack could feasibly be so severe that the internet itself is no longer available and a new base layer network needs to be propped up. Now we have to sync the chain over a network that might be inferior to what we have today.
It's already quite expensive today for anyone to run a fully verifying node anywhere in Australia. An entire continent is significantly disadvantaged from a security perspective with today's blockchain size, and that will only get worse with further size increases.
Large blocks also have some effects that exert financial pressure on miners to consolidate. Consolidation of miners has already become a serious problem for Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin Cash with the large blocks supported by miners is going through some turbulent times with these difficulty adjustments.
Some of the developers are even saying that a *smaller* block size would be better. That sounds crazy at first to most. But they've analyzed the growth in compute and network resources and have determined a size that keeps the blockchain growth from outpacing those. 
I think it's the right decision to value long term security over decreasing fees today. At least for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash with it's different design decisions has it's own, somewhat overlapping niche. But of course adoption isn't there. Hopefully with the Bitcoin name and the very similar technology that adoption can come quickly.
We don't really need the transactions that only make sense with low fees to keep growing. I think wide adoption is inevitable and we're past the tipping point, regardless of what the fees are (within some reason). Maintain security and let the market sort out the fees while we come up with the best technological solutions to scale *long term* so we can really bring the entire planet on board. End goals. This isn't about cheap small purchases. This is about disassembling the current monetary system across the globe. In order to do that it HAS to stay secure. The scaling problem also has to be solved, but not at the expense of security.

Important emphasis. If this is a bubble like the 2013 one, we could be in for a couple years of depressed values all the way back to the $1000-1500 range. I doubt that's the case but of course I could be wrong. I just think a lot more people noticed the 2013 spike and crash and later return to far higher value and consequently if it happens again a lot more people will hold what they have and buy in sooner and in higher volume if the price falls, short of some catastrophic event to bitcoin.

Some people think that if bcash can become just the slightest bit more profitable to mine that all the bitcoin miners will switch over en masse and the main bitcoin chain will die leaving them as "Bitcoin".
The price of bcash shot up over yesterday and today and is in fact now more profitable to mine.

I'm saying this is just utter nonsense.
There is absolutely many questions that need to be satisfactorily answered.
When you suggest there's no technical implications whatsoever of changing the blocksize, no useful discussion can occur.
audigex - what else are you into? I'm peeking into your post history. I see some posts on programming which makes me surprised that we're even having this conversation.
Reef tanks. Maybe that. Say you gotta tank set up and the water's getting dirty quickly. And somebody says you know, you just need 2 filters in it instead of one. Simple. Fix all your problems. (obviously I'm simplifying, I don't know reef tanks). You might think well wait hold on. That's not gonna work by itself. My pump probably won't push through 2 stacked filters. I need to get bigger inlet and outlets for more flow too, at least, and really I need a higher flow filter so I don't overload my pump. I don't really want to have to upgrade that part if I don't need to, it's expensive (for example: upload bandwidth is expensive when we talk about making the blockchain bigger).
System effects, right. You can't just change one thing and think nothing else is affected. All the pieces are variables in a big equation.
Or are you into cars? Audi? Just double your boost pressure. How many other parts of the system need to be accounted for? And say this engine is completely unique. One of a kind. Hand built. Now you doubled your boost and everything else to go along with it. New rods and pistons, fuel injectors, yada, yada. And now you have to tune it. You actually have to fire that thing up on a dyno (testnet) and run it and tweak everything and see how it reacts and maybe even go past the ECU and change some of your hardware to get a nice fat powerband with no knocking. But then you realize, you don't even have the roads paved yet (bitcoin is the internet in the early 90's still - we're on AOL still and you're complaining about not having YouTube).
Well, this is a global distributed network with a market cap of $60B and the people who built it don't even really care about the money, they're trying to change the world by reforming the entire monetary system. They're trying to be really, really careful not to screw something up and risk breaking it (and if you're not careful you might not know the change you made will break it until too late - the blockchain is permanent).
And you just told them to double their boost pressure, simple, change nothing else, and go rat rod down a yet to be paved road.

I don't know much about what mining pools cash out when, but this implies it isn't every single day.
Thinking it through, if 1/3 of the hash power cashes out at the same time once a month they would have "many thousands BTC".
If daily volume is $3B, hourly volume is $125M. This theoretical 1/3rd hash power group could have 17K BTC from a month of mining and maybe try to dump then $60M in the same hour. That's probably going to have an effect.
But, if I'm a mining pool with a bunch of coins, I wouldn't do that and depress the price, I'd sell slowly and steadily. Unless I wanted to lower the price for some nefarious purpose (not suggesting they do, just that they could).

And so has the price of BTC, and so has the recognition of it's value (and so has the miner's spam on the network to force this issue of "needing" a blocksize increase that happens to benefit them financially but unfortunately also erodes security).
Segwit is bring a roughly ~1.7x increase to the blocksize (with a maximum of 4x, but 1.7-2x is expected to be the realistic value in production). That activates today. Wallets and exchanges and everyone needs to upgrade to segwit compatible software, but much of that should already be in progress if not ready by major players.
Segwit enables further optimizations like Schnorr signatures that should be coming soon, and the development team has many more ideas to increase capacity: 
Ultimately, blockchain transactions will have a price consummate to their value. The market will ensure it. There is an *endless* queue of demand for space, even at today's low rate of adoption.
Adoption of LN also pushes fees down by reducing demand when many of the transactions competing for space today can be aggregated into a small set of transactions under LN. I believe the types of transactions that LN uses better utilize the extra available space from segwit, so as those are more common the blocksize will tend more towards the 4x multiplier of today's 1MB.

If Bitcoin becomes the main currency that's nice because it would increase in value a lot, but the real point is that cryptocurrency is a paradigm shift that will, inevitably, change the entire way we communicate and transfer value in the same manner that the Internet changed the way we communicate and transfer information.
Money today is hard line phones and letters through the physical mail. Cryptocurrency is the Internet of Money.
Bitcoin is particularly well positioned by being the first significant cryptocurrency. It has the longest history of being tested in the real world. There are billions of dollars sitting there waiting to be stolen if someone can figure out how but the Bitcoin protocol itself has never been broken (some sloppy exchange websites have been hacked and had their passwords stolen, but that is not bitcoin). Bitcoin has the network effect. It's what everyone already knows about. It might be the "MySpace" but it might be the "Facebook". We don't know yet.

It's normal to have smaller amounts of money more accessible, but less secure.
It's also different from fiat because no entity is diluting the supply of it by some unknown amount every second of the day. It can also be more secure against confiscation by government agents if you take the appropriate precautions

To be fair, a big part of the original vision of Bitcoin was in fact quick and cheap p2p payments. Being "digital gold" was also a part of that original vision. I think simply that reality set in and it became obvious that the Bitcoin protocol as is was not compatible with global scale quick and cheap p2p payments.
Maybe a different coin could exist or be created that could do both and be technically better, but the train's kinda sailed for now. Everyone's been backing and developing on Bitcoin and it needs continuity and trust for the entire cryptocurrency movement to stay on track.
Scaling as additional layers like Lightning Network is a realistic pivot to a combination of technical and political challenges. I think a year from now those solutions will have us in a much better place. Growing pains.

No one is saying that. I don't see that at all from Core devs. Simply that segwit2x implementation has issues itself, missed things that should go into a hardfork if one is being done, and that the timing is totally wrong. And of course also that it is being dictated by a set of companies largely under the control of one investment group.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:29:38
Because they've successfully shepherded the project up to this point. Because the parties to NYA don't have the authority to make an agreement dictating what Core will do without their input or agreement. There are also dozens of other contributing developers in agreement with those who hold the keys to commit. And beyond that there's a bar to meet when submitting changes to any open source project, much more one that runs a $50bn network. segwit2x simply hasn't even attempted to meet that bar. Core is doing the only responsible thing imho. NYA didn't submit a proposal for changes or garner any support for it in the developer community, the changes haven't been subjected to peer review or open testing. I've been a developer since dial up days. It seems that it would be wildly irresponsible to agree to pull those changes at this point in time.

No offense, but I don't think you have enough understanding of the technology to have an opinion that matters. Are you a software engineer with working bitcoin experience? If you are, you are free to join the technical discussion and state your case in an appropriate forum. It's an open source repository. Do you think you can make a coherent case to the other developers of bitcoin software that has securely and successfully run a $60B network for the last 9 years? You'll have to convince the entire development community of the merit of your proposal. That's how changes happen. That's what you do if you think differently.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:30:44


Did I say this?
You could just as rightfully say that allowing segwit2x is allowing a cabal of miners and a small group of economic interests to define what Bitcoin is.
If it's an option between just the two, I know which of those I'll stick with and it's not giving miners the power to change consensus rules in the future.
I'll trust those who resist changes to consensus rules, whoever that may be, unless there is an overwhelming justification for the change.


A large portion of the community does not agree.

Yes, exactly! If it wasn't, those who wanted a change to the core rules of Bitcoin - what counts as a valid block on the chain - could do whatever they saw fit, whenever they wanted.
Thankfully, Bitcoin doesn't work this way. If it did, it would have zero value.


The longest **valid** chain wins.
If you fork Bitcoin and change the consensus rules and mine blocks, your chain is not valid from the perspective of my fully verifying node.
It doesn't matter who's chain is longer. I have mine. You have yours. Great.
Now, there is an economic reality here. If everyone else who was using my chain went over and used your chain, well, my chain wouldn't be very useful anymore.
But you still can't change my rules without my permission. My bitcoin is not your bitcoin, and your bitcoin is not my bitcoin. Well, actually, the bitcoin I had on my chain will probably still be my bitcoin on your chain. Unless you really went HAM on the bad actor thing. But if you did that, it's unlikely all those people would've stopped using my chain and switched over to yours.
So that's what we have with segwit2x.
One group is saying we're going to change things - the consensus rules specifically. Block size more specifically. And we're going to change it our way on our time frame.
The other group is saying, nope. Not on my node. Your change doesn't meet the standard of technical review that the community developing this software since its inception agree on. For various reasons, we all reject this change. In fact, your suggestion is so far below the technical bar that's come to be expected, that our response is literally "LOL". You cannot be serious. That is not going into a trusted network with a $60B market cap that is trying to change the entire monetary system. We're trying to change the world, and trying to be really, really careful not to fuck that up. Your proposed change even lacks the most basic protections for both of us to coexist and let the real users in the market decide what they want. This can be viewed as nothing other than an attack, an attempt to coerce everyone to follow your consensus rules. 
And most lay-people won't understand what those rules are, or what the changes mean - in the narrow or in the broader sense, and if they do it'll be in a very general, non-technical opinion that misses all the detail these engineers have dealt with for near a decade, keeping the largest honeypot hacker prize ever known to humanity safe. Most lay-people wouldn't even realize the rules had been changed.
This rule you might say isn't so bad. But what about the precedent? The next rule could be allowing more Bitcoin to be mined over time. How's 42 million sound? Better than 21M right everyone? Don't worry we already changed it for you! You know, those poor miners don't get enough rewards. Let's undo all that halving stuff. Etc.
Now, the second group doesn't have any more authority than the first group.
Everyone is free to do whatever the hell they like. Libertarianism, yay!
But, you know, we've got a really noble goal in mind, and we're making money hand over fist. Are you really going to push your agenda that seems to be for your benefit, at the risk of the entire system? Oh, you are. Ok. Oh, and you're going to be a bit underhanded and shady about it, too? Ok. You look a lot like the bad actors of the system of old we're trying to replace. Are you sure you want to pick this fight? We built this. We will burn it to the ground before we let you co-opt it politically.
Group 1 is the NYA. AntMiner, Jihan Wu, ViaBTC, Barry Silbert. Somebody correct me if I'm misrepresenting people, but essentially a majority cabal of miners (who are already thought to have too much power in the system, more than Satoshi envisioned [thanks ASICs!]) and what appears to be a not-small group of companies (measured by economic activity) but have a common tie between most of them (Barry).
Group 2 is "Core". These are all of the people who mostly volunteer their time and effort and valuable expertise building this thing all us coat tail riders and everyone else are getting to benefit from (ok, that's a bit harsh, but be real with yourselves - did you build any of this? And if you did, you are the shit. thank you). Like, massively benefit. Like, biggest transfer of wealth in our lifetime if not much longer. As long as we don't burn it all to the ground. A few of these people work for a company called Blockstream. The majority do not.
And that's Core vs B2X. Generally. I'm sure someone else will come fill in more of the technical details. This has been discussed a lot lately.

I don't entirely disagree with you. Core and btc1 devs could work together to come to a resolution acceptable to all parties in the interim. 


The argument against that is increasing the block size has a known cost that will be experienced and is preferable to avoid. The permanent increase in blockchain size and resulting detriment to decentralization isn't (depending on one's opinion) worth increasing the blocksize right now just in case Walmart decides to start accepting bitcoin next month.
Block size increases aren't a solution to increased adoption. It's a very temporary measure to avoid a short term issue that barely if even exists right now that comes with a high and permanent cost.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:45:26
Not really. There's technicality, politics, history, and yes some bad actors. Considering it "religious" or blindly having faith in one side isn't going to help anything. Fees are high.

NYA said we'll support segwit if Core supports 2x. Core said no. NYA and everyone else proceeded to support segwit anyway. 
I don't see why they'd expect that Core would then go along with segwit2x. They didn't agree to the quid pro quo, and there's a lot of valid arguments why segwit2x is not ready to go forward.


Are you referring to segwit? segwit code had gone through proper peer review, had support of the developers, and had appropriate testing and fleshing out of the deployment plan, all things segwit2x has not done.
If you're referring to BCH, that was rushed and reckless, not an example to follow at all.

I'm fully aware of that point of view.


I do not believe this is the primary goal whatsoever.
Even if it is, I find segwit2x unacceptable. Miners and economic powers don't get to politically coerce changes to consensus rules. Period. If it is allowed, the idea of Bitcoin has failed.
I also find segwit2x technically insufficient and unnecessary at this time. The development community has too.
What does Bitcoin need lower transaction fees for right now? Coinbase wants to scale something, let them scale their customer service department.


Lightning Network. We'd be there by now if these same bad actors wouldn't have been attempting to hold segwit hostage to get their bigger blocks or FUD, as both seem to benefit from them.

If you still disagree, perhaps you could explain how we determine who the "attacker" is, in a way that's not susceptible to sybil:


Your client is, of course, free to ignore blocks it thinks are invalid.

@_date: 2017-08-23 19:38:20
I'm also not the only one to think that where mining ended up means Bitcoin has already failed: 
I do however still think we have a chance to save it, but not for long, and letting something like segwit2x through over the objection of the developers is not the way.
The public isn't going to abandon Bitcoin over the next year or two over larger fees after the run up we saw through this year. If we get through this turbulence successfully I think we will see the price of Bitcoin continue to grow at a similar pace, though I understand if you disagree.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:30:35
This is one reason Bitcoin does not need to expand the block size to lower fees to entice a bunch more users into the ecosystem.

@_date: 2017-08-21 08:07:54
It will be bitcoin. On the main blockchain you'll have one transaction that sets up a channel and another that closes it, and Lightning Network is just a way to create many transactions directly between parties, while still being secure and trustless, that then only need those two transactions on the main Blockchain to ultimately finalize all the intermediate Lightning Network transactions. You'd still get bitcoin. It's just kind of "caching" a bunch of small transactions - still Bitcoin transactions - in between a larger "opening" and "settlement" transaction on the main blockchain while retaining the essential sovereignty and security of Bitcoin's main blockchain.


This is like saying "gonna be fucking slaves to full nodes". The barrier to entry to run an LN node should be low and competition will be high. I'll be running a couple.

I suppose keep fees high by getting out from under second layer scaling? Or maybe large holders trying to prevent bitcoin from slipping into irrelevancy from failing to scale at all in time to keep first mover advantage.

Speed is not freedom.
Every additional bit in the blockchain erodes freedom and security. Significantly.
Off-chain solutions trade liquidity (locking up funds in contracts) for speed and scalability - orders of magnitude beyond what larger blocks could ever provide.
There's also good reason to believe larger blocks would fill up quickly and buy maybe months of time until we arrive back at the same place. In the face of miners spamming blocks to create crises and push their agenda it may not even be months until a 2MB block would be full.

You've missed some of the implementation details of Lightning Network.
As a receiving hub operator, someone who sends me funds can later send a transaction to close out the channel, and if I don't see that in time and close it out first, money I was already sent and expect to have will be reverted to the sender.

So, if users want 2MB base block, they should voice that to the developers and each other. If there is large community support but developers refuse to merge the change we could consider them acting in bad faith.

Hopefully just growing pains that will soon be improved. Keep in mind it turns out bitcoin can't do everything. It's been growing exponentially, and the segwit solution that's about to go live got blocked by political infighting for many, many months. The situation is looking better all around. Scaling by orders of magnitude is now necessary and can't be achieved with a simple block size increase. Concentration of mining power that allowed the political infighting to block technical progress should be less of a thing as we hear more stories like the recent one about Russia joining the bitcoin mining business.
I'm not sure where you're sending to/from or for what purpose but you could consider using something like litecoin for now. I believe in 6-12 months we'll have side-chain and Lightning Network solutions that return the full original vision of Bitcoin's utility to send fast and cheap peer to peer transactions around the world.

Yes, the main problem I see with BCH is the vitriol in the community. There can be place for BCH in the marketplace. BTC has proven it's place and BCH doesn't change that.


It's not shaping up to be a clean fork at all, if it were to happen. I don't think it will. I think BCH relieved the pressure to try to enforce NYA. I think the merchants and exchanges are much more willing to wait for second layer solutions than the miners were, and miners can and did help stake BCH in a way that the merchants cannot help stake segwit2x. And if that turns out to be the case I'll have to say without hesitation that BCH was a good thing.
BCH expanded the market cap of crypto and showed a scary fork can happen without major disruption. This is also a good thing for BTC.

What information led you to the conclusion that any particular transaction is "spam"?
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:37:23
another doubling of the block size. to deploy 90 days after segwit goes live. segwit is already a significant change in what the network traffic will look like. 90 days isn't enough time to properly analyze the changes and consider them before any more changes to the network traffic. 
It's not enough time to organize a deployment that is not disruptive. It has had little to no testing and there is no longer time for that. segwit and lightning network have been running on test nets for some time, and segwit has been live in litecoin for some time.
When the NYA agreement was made, the code for segwit2x hadn't even been submitted to the development community for review. The thoroughness of the proposal (lack thereof, really) earned it a literal LOL from the engineers who have been building Bitcoin for the past years.
Using block size increases, in order to support 7 billion people in the world performing 2 transactions per day would require 24GB blocks and the blockchain would increase 3.5 TB per day, 1.27 Petabytes per year.

I was meaning that miners are "allowed" by following consensus rules and effectively "fired" by changing them (if they don't follow the change). Granted, I will isolate myself and be relatively useless if I'm the only node that changes the rules. A mining node is only allowed to add blocks to a chain who's consensus rules are followed.

segwit is an update that changes the way data is stored in each block. It's a technical detail. But it includes a particular bug fix that allows LN and some other good tech.
Lightning Network aims to be a mesh network where many places would operate nodes - banks, merchants, people who just own bitcoin and want to use it to run a node for the fees, maybe in the future employers and governments. Software can find the best route through your open channels across the network to the destination. Like 6 degrees of separation. Imagine when Amazon, Apple, and Google run many LN nodes.
Of course it will take a while to build polished software and gain node deployments (if you hold you can help).
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:41:09
The developers also have some cool ideas around snapshotting the blockchain to take a big bite out of the size needed to sync a full node. When that's ready larger blocks might be a non issue. But it's not ready enough to make the bet on it right now.

I'm curious, why couldn't merchants be replaced? The thought in my head is that if there's an advantage in the market to transact in bitcoin or side-chains then users would choose merchants who do over those who don't. But I am interested in your take.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:06:33


It's a simple value proposition. Either your transaction is worth the fee, or it is not. Proven secure blockchain space is a useful and limited resource.
If it was "too damned high" people wouldn't pay it and less transactions would be made lowering demand and therefore price until an equilibrium is reached. So, don't blame BTC. The market sets the price.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:45:35
I really appreciate the conversation.


Once again we're in total agreement. Though I question if we're technologically ready for a lot more adoption right now, and if the current rate of growth is better for the next year than trying to bring in a significant amount more. 


I want to preface by saying that miners are a extremely important part of the Bitcoin network.
I'm also assuming by "control" you mean the ability to dictate changes to consensus rules of the protocol - something like changing the blocksize. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
I cannot understate how emphatically I disagree on this. It is 100% the anti-thesis of Bitcoin. Users control bitcoin. Owners control their coin. It's the fundamental premise. It is what makes Bitcoin so valuable (along with network effect and all the great people building in the space including miners, I don't want to discount that). But without that control of the rules of money in the hands of the owners of that money Bitcoin is nothing different from a very inefficient and slow PayPal.
Owners control their coin. When it comes to consensus rules the default is to keep the status quo and a change is supposed to require a majority of users. I cannot emphasis this enough. It is the whole point. Everything else is secondary. This cannot be compromised. That might mean Bitcoin could fail but that is what we all signed up for. Sovereignty over our money. Not easy, cheap, or fast transactions - but we do really want to provide that too, of course, just not at the possible expense of sovereignty over our money.
If you're not on board with that, plan your exit strategy or transition to another coin because miners as they exist today controlling consensus rules is not Bitcoin. Forcing it has the distinct possibility of causing a very ugly and profit destroying split.
Why do you mine Bitcoin and not another coin? With all that capital investment and competition? Because it pays, right? 
We, I, the Bitcoin economy greatly appreciates the service miners provide. But that is miners position. Providing a service for hire. We are economic partners too, but equals with regards to consensus rules. If Bitcoin fails to provide a profitable business model for you, that would greatly disappoint me and all the developers and Bitcoin holders because we all want this to succeed. The model of Bitcoin is that it is more profitable for you to support us then to go against us, because we expect you will rationally seek the most profit. It is human nature.
The Bitcoin whitepaper can make this issue seem open to interpretation because it assigns the right of longest chain to hashpower. But that is not the spirit of the whitepaper. Trying to interpret it by the letter rather than the spirit is either a misunderstanding or hostile. Hash power was supposed to be spread among everybody and act as a sybil attack resistant tally for the collective owners of Bitcoin.
I understand that miners and the exchanges and merchants are the centers of the economic activity that also give Bitcoin it's value. But that cannot result in consensus rules being changed without the majority of the users (people who own coin). If that happens Bitcoin's core premise has failed. You may still have something else, but it is not Bitcoin. A lot of regular people won't know the difference. But the geeks who built it all will. They will hard fork and change proof of work and do their best to keep it alive and if dies they'll start over or go home. They will not follow.
I speak strongly, and obviously I cannot speak for others, but I do not think I am embellishing or significantly misrepresenting the way a lot of people view it.
Now, from the protocol's perspective, hash power rules. Mining got centralized. Hash power no longer represents the users. So you have power to force changes. Miners have the ability to coordinate a 51% attack today. But such a change will be unethical if a majority of users do not agree. I believe this would be near fatal. Certainly for the miner's relationship with Bitcoin. Quite possibly for Bitcoin's relationship with the public at large. Possibly for cryptocurrency as a whole's relationship with the public at large.
Who is a user? Anyone who owns Bitcoin. You are probably one. If you mine under a company that company is also one, in as much as they trade and buy and sell coin. One user, each, equal to me, equal to every other user. Hash power was supposed to be a proxy for that because it was resistant to sybil attack. But it required real decentralization of mining, and we lost that.
In reality, you do actually have more voice than me or most users, and that is good. Miners are extremely important. You have additional channels and social value to communicate with developers and business and express your concerns and ideas and wishes. You understand more of the bigger picture than the average user. You're success is everyone else's success and we all want that.
Most of us users effectively have to proxy our vote because of the centralization of mining. Non-mining nodes are too easy to sybil attack. Should our proxy be a miner? Coinbase? Overstock.com? Or do you think most people would choose the developer community for their proxy? That is what I think. And if miners, business, and developers agree the rest of the users are almost certainly going to be on board in a wide majority. We trust the developers. They got us where we are today. They have retained our trust. For those who they have not, they now have Bitcoin Cash. At least from a technical perspective (not a moral one imho) that was by and large the ethical way to fork for a minority that disagrees with Bitcoin's consensus rules and wants to do it differently. 
But if you were building a rocket, and you said to the engineer hey we really want to get there faster let's put engines twice as big on. The engineers would say no, that's not safe. They'll even explain in excruciatingly painful detail why. We shouldn't dismiss the engineers lightly. I'm a software developer myself. Not in the crypto space but I will vouch for the Bitcoin dev team any day. They are handling the project well in my opinion. Safely. Conservatively. I have put a lot of fiat in the system for an individual. It is essential that I trust it stays safe and that I do not fear loss from an attack or a well-meaning but misguided attempt at improvement, and not just today but 50 years from now and in the event large governments try to attack my property. If the fundamentals of Bitcoin cannot survive the marketplace and the real world, I accept that risk.
Consider too from your point of view as a holder of Bitcoin. Do you not want that same thing? Is that more or less valuable to you than making cheap, fast payments. And not forever, over the next year or two, and then we'll have those too. Raising block size is not an obviously hostile change, you may even think it's a good one. And your voice should count. But if we capitulate to pressure from a small group of economically important actors it sets a precedent. It's block size this time but the next time, or when the block rewards dwindle, it might be the 21M coin limit and mining rewards. I really don't want to set that precedent. I think it immensely erodes at the value proposition of Bitcoin long term. It's also damaging to the good and profitable relationship we've all shared so far, possibly irrevocably.
Unfortunately, it is all but impossible to get really get a consensus of users at this point. Which should mean for consensus rules the default is the status quo, unless miners, developers, and a significant amount of the economic nodes agree on the change and there is no large outcry from the rest of users.
If many of the business backing the NYA agreement dropped their support of segwit2x - if we see more [announcements like Bitwala's]( - would you feel like miners would be acting ethically to continue with the hard fork? If the answer is no (and how could it not be if no one is running compatible clients), I'd say you are effectively proxying your vote to the businesses. Is it ok to let the businesses decide for everyone?
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:40:44

Segwit already increases the block size to a max of 4MB with an average expected block size a bit under 2MB. Segwit 2X doubles that to a max of 8MB and expected average around 4MB.
Segwit is already a very significant update and will change network dynamics. Making a change so soon after to double the block size doesn't provide time to properly evaluate the effects of segwit and the potential further effects of another block size increase. From a technical standpoint, it's irresponsible.
There's a long standing and accepted process for suggesting changes to Bitcoin. You make a proposal and the merits are discussed. Changes will not be accepted if a consensus among developers is reached. segwit2x has not met this bar.


Those running btc1's segwit2x will be the ones splitting, technically.

I do not support changing the development team whatsoever. Miners are labor, not governance. I think BCH was reckless and self-serving, though I'll grant some recognition for not causing a giant mess. On the other hand, driving the narrative that it would cause a giant mess boils my blood. I think segwit2x is a non-starter and I expect it will go away before Nov, but I'll be watching what companies actively push it in the meantime.
I just disagree about pointing right to the door.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:31:17


I don't have a good reference for the impact. Are we at least both talking about bandwidth, not memory or storage space, which is not the problem with larger blocks?


I somewhat disagree. Larger blocks provide lower fees in the short to mid term. Lower fees lead to more usage, more transactions, more people. An already overextended customer support system degrades further with more people needing support.


This is a drawback to LN. There's [almost] always a trade-off. Both larger blocks and LN make compromises for more scale.


I'll admit my position on the pros and cons of 2MB base blocks in isolation from segwit activtion are not solid. I don't know enough specifics to claim my opinion is worth the bits it's transmitted with. I maintain my position that 2MB base blocks now or shortly following deployment of segwit, and specifically segwit2x, is not clearly good enough to proceed with.




No. Only if the individual user has knowingly decided to proxy their opinion.

I don't think we disagree that much. Users decide the value. Miners can run what they want. They will waste money if they mine on a chain users don't value. If miners change the rules, I'm free to go my separate way. That may be to my detriment and not the miners if I'm in the minority and the rest of the users switch to those rules. If I'm in the majority, and many users decide not to follow those rules, the miners are spending energy mining a chain with less value. Taken to the extreme, if all the miners in the world say we're going with these rules, and all the users in the world say no we'll stick with these rules - where's the value? Will new miners come to work for the users or will new users come bring value to the miners?
All that said, I was getting a bit heated earlier.
But, already today this bitcoin is perverted. Users were supposed to be miners. I see the problems of the last couple of years, this entire scaling debate, arising from the centralization of mining power. On an angsty day, I might welcome a pow change to try resetting that imbalance.

@_date: 2017-08-23 23:08:44
Two miners find a block right about the same time and broadcast it to the rest of the network before either could be confirmed. I think some nodes confirm one block and some nodes confirm the other but the one with the longest chain by proof of work ends up taking over and the other block is orphaned and thrown away and that miner gets no reward.
This is one of the reasons that larger blocks can push slightly towards more miner centralization. Miners that can propagate block faster have a lower chance of getting orphaned. It seems like it would have a fairly small effect, though.
I don't know exactly but that should be pretty close to how it works.

It had to at least be a significant part of the reason. They would be wide open to litigation over every last bit of BCC if they didn't distribute it, and at 10% the value of BTC, even less, people are going to want it.

Honestly I'm still wrapping my head around it all but I thought that between bidirectional channels and channel refills and I think a bit more that was mitigated to some degree but obviously I'm still not entirely clear on it. I don't recall if it was covered near the end of that video - the beginning makes the situation look very lopsided, some posts here by the dev team have more info but I don't have links saved (this one had [some info](
There are some trade offs to LN nodes, but you rarely get orders of magnitude more scale for nothing.
You have choice to use or avoid any node. We'd rely on market forces to provide for at least some preferred nodes.
I can imagine a future where a node adds the service to allow purchase data tracking for advertising analysis but is an opt in that also pays you back a fair market value for it.
Employers could run nodes and pay you directly into channels. If a lot did that, there would be a large mesh network from that alone.
Even banks can have a future if they pivot.
It's all still optional and our money stays in our control and gives the consumer back a lot of market power.

You do understand that segwit2x isn't 2MB blocks, right? Segwit without 2x will have blocks around 2MB on average and segwit2x would have blocks around double that on average with a max of 8MB.
I mean, no offense, I'm certainly no crypto code expert, but while us less informed folks may have opinions I trust the process that has been utilized for years and enforced by the admins of the  repository as to what technical changes have garnered proper support and consensus and have run the gauntlet of proper peer review, testing, and verification along with having a proper and safe plan for deployment and segwit2x has met none of that.

Isn't Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment based on the average of the last 2015 blocks?
If you only switched mining power over for a short period before a difficulty adjustment, it would only have a small effect on the average block time over the previous period.
It seems like the only way to slow Bitcoin after the new DAA would be to mine at a loss on the other chain, but in doing so you'd push out every other miner that didn't want to mine at a loss.

Transactions can be different sizes, depends how many inputs and outputs it has. The smallest transactions are about 250 bytes, so around 32,000 can fit in an 8MB block. The Bitcoin Cash block I linked to was filled with large transactions. Large transactions can be legitimate, but they can also be part of an attack vector.

Many wallets do, some don't. I sent two transactions this weekend and both made it into the next block and were considered cleared by the recipient in 2 confirmations - under 20 minutes both times (granted, I did have a bit of luck there).
I did pay a somewhat large fee in $ terms, but a fraction of a tenth of a percent of the value of the transaction. I used Electrum and set the fee manually.

I'm saying they may not be insolvent at all. They engaged Friedman, a well respected auditor, who has so far released [this preliminary statement]( while the audit is ongoing.
Naysayers will yell, that's not an audit, it even says right in it - only for management's use - but that's more cover-your-ass legalese like Tether's terms and conditions. Their full report isn't finished. This is a simple statement that they did a quick review on one date and saw $400M in Tether's bank(s), matching the amount of tethers issued at the time.
This is more than any other cryptocurrency exchange has ever done to establish trust in the history of cryptocurrency. No well-respected auditor has ever reviewed a crypto exchange. Friedman even putting their name on this much is a big deal.
This also seems like part of a long running set of FUD campaigns aimed at shaking the market and causing dips, likely so people at the top pushing these narratives can profit off trading the emotional swings of the masses. In the last 6 months it was Bitcoin hard forking, then the flippening/chain death spiral, china ban + Jamie Dimon, segwit2x, cashening: the flippening part 2, and now tether (not the first time for tether, either).

BCH has often had a scary low amount of hash power. There have been times when BCH had less than 1% of total SHA256 hash power.

I paid $14 on a transaction with a handful of inputs and was in the next block. Because of Bitcoin's security, 2 confirmations was plenty for the recipient. I don't particularly like $14 fees, but it was a fraction of a tenth of a percent of the value of the transaction.

We're taking lessons learned from Tor and torrents and applying them to cryptocurrency.

1. No, at least not that I'm not aware of. Coding a wallet to do this (send to an exchange without your input) seems like a big security issue.
2. A Nano S is reasonably inexpensive. If you're just holding and not transacting much at all, a paper wallet can be fine. At this point, if you have even as much as 0.1 BTC I'd consider a hardware wallet if you transact very much.
3. Not less than $35K, maybe as much as 100K.

I wonder if perhaps you misunderstand what LN is and how it works. Bitcoin already supports LN. LN is simply a manner of exchanging pre-signed Bitcoin transactions (that are time-locked contracts) that either party can broadcast to the Bitcoin network at any time.
A hard fork that made LN not work anymore would have to make transaction id's malleable (changeable) again, or remove CheckLockTimeVerify and/or CheckLockSquenceVerify op codes in Bitcoin script.
And no we're not stuck with it. You could simply not use it and close any channels you have open.

Let me show you how to determine a minimal fee that will likely confirm in the next block.
Go here to see the actual mempool stats: 
Hover your mouse on the right edge of the bottom graph. Look for the lowest fee amount that still has less than 1MB worth of transactions.
When I took this screenshot, that was 30 satoshi/byte. Set it a little bit higher if you want to be extra sure you confirm in the next block - if a batch of higher paying transactions comes in before the next block gets mined, you might get pushed back a bit.

You can also go here to check out the current mempool: 
Go to the bottom graph and hover over the very right edge. In the image below you can see it's still under 1MB at 40 satoshi/byte, so that fee has a great chance of getting you in the next block. This is an older image - right now 20 sat/byte will get in the next block.

One big difference between GPU/CPU and ASIC's is that GPU/CPU can just be switched to whatever coin is most profitable at any time. The cost of a hash power attach is reduced by the resale value or the difference between purchase and rent costs. 
ASIC's create a long term economic incentive for the miners that is aligned with holders of the coin. Decred has an interesting take where stake holders can forfeit PoW rewards if miners act against the interests of stake holders.

That didn't happen after the Bitcoin Cash fork. And for segwit2x way more people appear to be lining up for the "free money" with much better support to trade fork coins on day 1.

It'll continue to follow the price ratio between the two. You looked at a point where BCH was more profitable because the price ratio was changing in BCH's favor and it takes mining a bit to catch up.
When BCH becomes more profitable miners switch over, but the DAA adjusts before long raising difficulty and making it less profitable.
Hashrate seems to be trending down on BCH:

I think the idea is that you might have something like pool software where you can join larger groups. Also, if I understand correctly these channel factories are distinct from your LN channels. LN becomes Layer 3 and the factories become Layer 2.
It's not a near term solution - no real implementation work has been done that I'm aware of - but it requires no changes to Bitcoin or LN protocols, and usage can be phased in relatively easily.

1. Multiple connections help you be able to find a route through multiple hops to someone you wouldn't normally be connected to directly. Think 6 degrees of separation. If most people are connected to a few other people, practically anyone in the world should be able to connect to anyone else.
2. Very low fees are possible, making micro transactions possible. Micro transactions are not economically feasible on-chain.
3. This is a big positive. It uses onion routing, like tor, so that each hop in the route only knows about the single previous and next hops.
4. The cost of processing a transaction is several orders of magnitude lower. It is not necessary for an LN transaction to be verified and recorded on a permanent global ledger, the transaction only has to pass from sender to recipient.
If we were transacting over a Lightning Network channel, we'd just be passing back and forth slightly different time locked smart contracts. The set up transaction guarantees on the block chain that the funds exist and are locked. The specifics of how those smart contracts are constructed to represent each LN transaction is cleverly set up so that both parties are protected with the worst case scenario being that your funds sit locked until the contract expires. The closing transaction is just submitting the last contract to the blockchain to settle the balance.
A few days ago, another paper was released describing a way to structure contracts for scalable (re-)funding of payment channels. This scales LN 10x as is, and 25x with Schnorr signatures (coming soon most likely). This funding protocol can be smoothly added to LN once it is well vetted and ready. No new features are needed in the Bitcoin protocol.
Another advantage of LN is that I'll be able to run a hub and fund channels with my BTC and earn transaction fees. I have spare equipment and solid internet and am in IT, so why not monetize it. Get that money making money. I'm now incentivized to participate in the network and fully verify the blockchain.

I'm not sure what you're referring to. That you have to be AML/KYC verified with Tether to process deposits and withdrawals? I can see it as sensible that Bitfinex separates themselves from the entity that handles fiat transactions, from a regulatory exposure perspective.
That you can't be a client unless you are depositing some minimum (large) amount? I'm not sure if this is even the case. It could be. Why can't I trade at Genesis Trading, or Circle? Does that mean those companies are insolvent?


Who can't? I haven't seen anyone with a Tether account that has reported being unable to withdraw funds. Do you have evidence to the contrary? Do you worry that you can't transfer Bitcoin to Gemini, trade it for USD and withdraw it if you don't even have an account there?

We don't trust exchanges by and large today, but as Bitcoin rolls out to the masses better custodial solutions will be created.

I'm assuming that the more uses cases a HF would break and the more mis-allocation of existing BTC funds (if even possible) it would cause, the less market value the HF would have.
Anyone could HF to raise the coin issuance to 42M and give half of every block to miners, but no one (or close enough) would follow it. Similarly, if there is a significant amount of funds in time locked contracts, and a HF was created that broke those and resulted in lost funds, no one (or close enough) would follow it.

Or it could get clogged up with 8MB blocks that only have a few hundred transactions, and it only costs about $100 per block for the fees.

You could sell just some now. Maybe 20% or something. I personally think people who ideologically support Bitcoin Cash but also hold Bitcoin will trade B2X for BCH, possibly pumping the price, though there may be other people who have been saving BCH to sell at exactly that time to counteract the pump. But I think there will be a higher price to sell at in the next 2 weeks. Maybe sell more then like 40-60%. If segwit2x goes very bad for BTC, BCH may continue to rise in value some after the fork. You could save a last bit for then, risking selling it a bit lower for the chance of it being a bit higher..

scaling off-chain negates this type of attack. When a single on-chain transaction represents thousands of off-chain transactions, it won't really matter if the on-chain transaction has to pay 10 satoshi/byte or 1000 satoshi/byte.

Sounds like Coinfloor might be a bad deal. I pay about 2% over market price to buy via ACH and 4.5% to buy via Visa/Mastercard. That's covering the bid/ask spread and fees, except for the Bitcoin network transaction fee to move Bitcoin into my own wallet, but that's insignificant relative to the value of the transactions (less than 0.1%).

If you bought some with a ACH bank transfer (not a credit/debit card) it takes like 5 business days for Coinbase to clear the payment and release your BTC or LTC. The balance in your BTC and LTC wallet will not reflect the coins you are still waiting to receive.

@_date: 2017-11-12 00:42:11
By then they will hard fork to a new difficulty adjustment algorithm that adjusts every block. If miners flock over, the difficulty quickly rises to equalize profitability. If they abandon, the difficulty quickly falls to also equalize.
I think it should result in only miners who support the other chain ideologically mining on it, no more swings between chains due to profitability differences.
Perhaps I'm missing something, though. Here's some content on the new DAA:

If all the money in the world were used to buy Bitcoin, the price would go **way** higher than $3.5M.

@_date: 2017-11-07 23:45:02
I'm going against what I would normally do and moving Bitcoin to Coinbase and a couple other exchanges ahead of the fork so that I can trade the segwit2X coins immediately, [hopefully] before the price is dumped into the ground.
Bitcoin Gold was a good example. It doesn't even exist, you can't use it at all, but if you'd had BTC on the right exchanges at the time of the fork you could've traded 1 BTG for like 0.07 BTC. I think it's like 0.02 now, and only because no one can actually split it themselves and send it anywhere.

The dip at $5k happened because China told crypto exchanges to shut down. The dip at $7.5k happened because segwit2x got cancelled.
Unless some big news comes out coincidental to the $10k price, I wouldn't expect a significant drop. Maybe 5%-10% if we struggle too much to break $10k. If $10k breaks, I'd expect $11k to come quite soon after.

Yeah, and the joke is on the NYA signatories who thought they could either make an announcement and enforce a hard fork or make an announcement and stop one from happening.
There were also people who made bets on this contingent on a fork happening at all. If you stood to collect 250 BTC would you find a way to mine a few 2x blocks? What if you and a few buddies had 1000 BTC riding on it? Think for $7M you'd deploy and mine 2x for a while, whether anyone or any exchange cared at all or not?

Probably fraud alert on the card - that's been the case when I get an email right after saying the purchase was cancelled. Usually the card company would call you to check if the transactions are valid to unlock your card (after which you'll have to re-purchase), but if they aren't calling you I'd give them a call.

@_date: 2017-11-05 22:50:46
Let's look at a couple of recent examples.
Bitcoin Cash. A lot of people see the 1MB block size as a problem for Bitcoin. That the limited space is raising fees and hurting adoption. If you believe this, you think the potential value of Bitcoin is less than if it had larger blocks. You might sell off some of your Bitcoin. Across the market, this holds the price of Bitcoin down compared to if this fear didn't exist.
So, Bitcoin Cash forks with bigger blocks. Many thought the value of Bitcoin + Bitcoin Cash would equal the value of Bitcoin before the fork. That is, the price of Bitcoin would drop in an amount similar to the value of Bitcoin Cash.
But that's not what happened. The fork represented an alternative, an option with larger blocks, partly removing the fear in the market that smaller blocks were holding back Bitcoin (but it didn't shake all fear, as Bitcoin Cash has it's own problems).
You could say that the value of Bitcoin Cash represents a reduced amount of uncertainty in the market. This is where the "free" money came from. Money that would have already been in the market had this uncertainty not existed.
It allowed people to choose between the current Bitcoin development road map and one that prioritized larger blocks (and removed segwit and RBF, etc.). Many people choose that the current Bitcoin development road map is the best path at this time, and 90%+ of this new value has gone into Bitcoin.
So it has not diluted Bitcoin's value. Instead these forks have allowed more value to enter the ecosystem and the majority of that value has gone into Bitcoin.
The same is true of Bitcoin Gold, reducing uncertainty about mining centralization and the effects of ASIC's. The same will be true of Segwit2X, focusing solely on the block size and without some of the negatives of Bitcoin Cash (but with other negatives, though imho less of them overall vs BCH).
Look at what's happened to the alt coin market in the last couple weeks. This extended scaling debate has come to a head and is about to be resolved. In two more weeks there will be no more doubt about which Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and the price has done little but skyrocket in anticipation.
Besides, if these forks could ruin Bitcoin, the thing's fucking broken already. Better to kill it sooner than later, and keep the damages lower.

And that hurts fungibility, a very important property. Moving transactions off-chain increases fungibility. Lightning Network also provides economic incentive to hold Bitcoin and run a full node (and stake an LN hub).

Developers conservatively estimate 12-18 months. Zap wallet is in development and functional. Lightning Network transaction fees also incentivize adoption. I'm a software developer and I certainly plan to look into running a hub and my meager stack of BTC is enough to do so usefully.
This is like the Internet in the early/mid 90's. It took 20 minutes to download a decent resolution jpg image over the phone lines, but now we're watching streaming 4k.
Fast and cheap transactions are not unique and not what makes Bitcoin different and valuable. Trustlessness and censorship resistance are the foundational features. Fast and cheap transactions have to be built on top of trustless and censorship resistance. They are important and add great additional value, but they are less important than other features of Bitcoin.

idk, maybe more in the alt coins. A number of people I know have started buying Bitcoin this year and they're all professional working adults shifting 5 figures of their savings into a new asset class. They're all aware of the volatility, how many people regret selling previously, and how even the enormity of Mt Gox only suppressed the price for a few years. Someone who bought at the 2013 peak and held until today still outperformed pretty much any other asset on value appreciation. They're putting their BTC on hardware wallets and sticking the seed phrase in a tamper-evident container in a safety deposit box at their bank and leaving it alone.

I saw that $20M in tethers was just sent on-chain.
How much do you think that $20M can raise the marketcap? You say only a few million dollars for $1B, so $20M, by your estimation, could raise it $6-7B?
How many Bitcoin does $20M buy? 2000.
Let's look at the order books. Bitfinex: current price: $9850. Price if 2000 BTC are bought off the order books: $10000. $150 increase per BTC = $2.4B increase in market cap. Even if Bitfinex is the only exchange you're still quite a bit off.
But.. that's just one exchange, with only 8% of the volume.
That $20M is barely going to budge the market.

Litecoin - Faster blocks (and hence more block space), cheaper fees, a benevolent leader. Fairly stable value but still rising. It was able to lead on activation of segwit and will interoperate with Bitcoin via Lightning Network and atomic swaps.
Monero - Private and fungible, and decently liquid. This is needed in the crypto space. Also fairly stable in value but still rising.
Decred - On-chain governance, and the devs are heavily involved in the ecosystem (btcd, lnd)
Bitcoin Cash - Provides relief for those who really, really wanted bigger blocks (but didn't own Litecoin I guess).

More like it takes 4 Litecoin blocks to have the same amount of trust in the immutability of a mined transaction as 1 block in Bitcoin.
However, faster blocks would allow for more granularity in choosing an acceptable risk level. Maybe one 2.5 minute block is better than 0 conf or 10 minutes for someone's use case while being acceptably risky.
Unless block size is reduced to match faster block times, it would be an increase to total throughput and come with all the caveats of that.

Well, Lightning Network has transaction fees, and those go to the operators of the hubs providing the Bitcoin liquidity for those off-chain transactions.
Off-chain fees go to Bitcoin holders who lock their funds up in Lightning Network hubs to facilitate LN transactions.
Some coins use Proof of Stake models and provide a staking reward. In a way, it's similar to that, but without changing the core Bitcoin protocol. It just incentives people economically to participate in Lightning Network, and allows you to earn more Bitcoin with your Bitcoin without counterparty risk.
Pretty friggin exciting if you ask me.
I'm also unlikely to explain it well, but it seemed like there was incentive to keep a funded LN hub channel small-ish, acting against centralization of LN hubs. If I recall correctly, the initial software will have a funding limit built in. This could be bypassed, as the limit is not enforced by protocol, but then someone would have to code and test that itself. The protocol also has risk of bad actors causing funds to be unavailable for some time until time locks expire, so that risk also incentivizes towards smaller channel funds.
I mention this because a lot of people think LN is destined to be centralized, but from my understanding the economic incentives push against centralization.

Or it's people (with 6-8 figures fiat) trading USD for USDT so they can transfer USDT to all the various exchanges where they can hold a USDT balance but not a USD balance where they can then, gasp, place buy orders for crypto.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:44:54
Depends on how long the depressed price hung around. 25k might not last long. 200k might.
I think the 25k were moved to Bitfinex - they recently banned users in the U.S. just FYI in case that applies to you.


I think this is a pretty wide spread sentiment. A lot of people would love to both get some free coins and decrease the leverage Ver has in Bitcoin.
Ethereum had a flash crash on GDAX not that long ago. Some people caught buys at some ridiculously low price like $1 followed by an immediate rebound up to like $200 (iirc). I thought GDAX actually compensated people who had standing orders filled at low prices and lost money, but that would not be expected from many exchanges.

Large economic nodes - exchanges and wallets - have scaling options on the table. If segwit was widely implemented we'd have 1.7-2x the transaction capacity. Miners blocked activation of segwit for *many* months. Transaction batching is also not widely used and could greatly reduce fees for everyone.
Service providers are abusing the technology and not being good stewards while simultaneously causing disruption and trying to push changes that just continue to externalize their costs onto the commons.
People who need to use Bitcoin and who are affected by high fees should be pressuring the middle-men in this space to be better members of the community or taking their business elsewhere, or maybe dropping the middle-men altogether, as is the Bitcoin ethos.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:22:42
Yep. The network is very congested, hitting a peak overnight as the combination of low hash power and many people sending high value transactions that were willing to pay more and more for transaction fees, bidding the price of them up.
If you really need to get a transaction through right now, you can but it will be expensive. Otherwise you may want to use a different payment method until the backlog clears, which could take a few days. This is one of the largest Bitcoin has experienced.
Your tone, however, is childish and entitled. Other people are willing to pay for the scarce resource of block space right now. Overall, it's a feature, not a bug. Yes it sucks but smart people have been working hard to provide long term solutions that scale to global usage.

How about something not as contentious, a new, additional document. Decred has a constitution, for example, but it's probably too late for something with that weight of authority. Perhaps a statement of principals with some sybil-proof method of showing support or dissent.


I'm no expert but I think I'd rather see a mixed PoW/PoS system. Additionally, I'd like to see a transition to a new PoW that had scientific utility (ASIC friendly). If we're going to economically incentivize the world's largest supercomputer we should task it to something useful. Perhaps a further step could be multi-PoW.


This risk is scary, but this idea is so contrary to the ethos of Bitcoin that I don't think I could support it.

Block weight could already be around 2MB in practice and LN and sidechains possibly deployed by now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:16:14
Middle-men service providers should spend more time implementing the efficiency improvements available today rather than push for contentious forks that externalize their costs onto the commons.
If blockchain.info alone implemented segwit we'd be at something like 1.4x transaction capacity. And then there's Coinbase that doesn't even bother to batch outputs, passing on pointlessly high fees to everyone.
This is also a large, unusual event out of the norm. Yes transaction fees are high right now, but outside of major drama and BCH's boost mining spikes, mempool has been clear and fees relatively low - with a segwit transactions during normal times a transaction gets confirmed quickly for a fraction of a dollar.
But sure, let's just capitulate to business interests who are poor stewards of the technology that allows them to exist and that Bitcoin intended to disintermediate in the first place.

LN &amp; segwit are separate things. Wallets don't need to support segwit for Lightning to deploy. Lightning just needed the transaction malleability fix that was in the segwit soft fork.
Also, I don't want to be too easy on them, but large economic centers like Coinbase should take their time to ensure their systems are engineered correctly before going live with segwit wallets. Segwit has only been live for 3 months. You generally can't get an upgrade handling millions of dollars out the door that quickly.

Your analogy is right. If you use it that way - transfer several purchases worth of Bitcoin to Litecoin, for example, and then send Litecoin to vendors. But what multiple will you really save - 3x, 4x, maybe 10x - and it's on each individual to manually manage that. I just meant it probably won't have much widespread effect.
I thought perhaps an atomic swap might have also taken two transactions on each change, but when trying to verify that I'm not seeing that the 2nd transaction is actually submitted.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:03:05
There are solutions on the table right now - transaction batching and segwit.
Large economic nodes - largely middle-men mind you - push contentious changes that externalize their costs onto the commons instead of being good members of the community and stewards of the technology and implementing the 2x+ transaction capacity that can be utilized right now.

Correct, and if you were lucky enough to be one of the first people to be able to trade you had a shot at somewhere up to 0.15 of BTC. If you traded the future, you could've gotten as much as 0.3 of BTC.
So, some free coins.
But if you weren't towards the front of the line this was going to get dumped so fast, so hard most people wouldn't have gotten anything worth mentioning.

Well, the supply would dry up until the next difficulty adjustment. Demand would depend on the totality of people's reactions to slow blocks and high fees.
Holding Bitcoin is free. Mining Bitcoin costs money. The opportunity costs of mining Segwit2x at a loss - say it maintains the price ratio the futures are currently trading at (15/85), that's 10's of millions of dollars lost by miners before the next difficulty adjustment.

You wouldn't actually have to use Ledgerwallet's channel, though you could. As long as there is *some* route of LN wallets connecting any one of your channels to one of Ledgerwallet's channels you could make the near instant, near zero fee transaction.
LN works a lot like Tor. The software will automatically find a route through all the nodes on the network. If none exist, you can open a new channel. As your payment hops from channel to channel, each one only knows the one previous hop and the one next hop. It doesn't know if the previous hop was the beginning or just an intermediate hop, same with the next hop. (So, it greatly improves privacy and anonymity as well).
Opening a channel does require an on-chain funding transaction, and closing a channel requires an on-chain transaction, too. The idea is that your software would open a few channels - and you wouldn't even know who's they are - and they would stay open for some time. As people open more and more channels, everyone gets connected to everyone else - like six degrees of separation.

Yeah, because the market cap of BTC is simply the spot price times the number of coins in circulation.
BTC is a limited quantity, and the vast majority of BTC that exists is not even for sale on the market.
If you tried to actually buy BTC with that $80T the price would rise faster than the $ spent as all the supply for sale was exhausted.
It won't take $40B of new money to go from $160B to $200B marketcap. It works in the opposite direction, too. If everyone tried to sell their BTC you wouldn't get $160B out because the price would fall quickly to next to $0 as people willing to buy at any higher prices were filled.

It can be as simple as it appears. People wire USD to Tether to buy tethers 1:1 so they can transfer to exchanges and trade. In particular, if you run a large arbitrage operation you would only be efficient if you used Tether.
With all the mainstream media attention and run up in prices all year, it only makes sense that people are actually putting more money into crypto. This is just one avenue. Volume is well distributed across many exchanges.
The bit in their terms is just cover-your-ass legal terms. There may be situations where they can't or don't want to redeem funds. What if they were stolen funds? It may be phrased in such a way to avoid some U.S. financial regulation - Bitfinex has cut ties with all U.S. customers.

Bitcoin Diamond is a pretty minor offshot. I don't know why you'd expect all the exchanges to have support already. Has GDAX provided your Bitcoin Gold, which has already had an actual working blockchain for a while?

It is a bit of a chicken and egg problem (which comes first). Bitcoin can grow and has grown both as a store of value and an appreciating investment as well as a currency. It seems to be working.
Personally, I think the expectation of greater future value is the more important part. This incentivizes people to offer to accept Bitcoin for goods and services. If there's little barrier to accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, it doesn't matter that much for now if very few people pay with Bitcoin.

LN is peer to peer. The risk of having funds locked up until contracts expire by bad actors disincentivizes large hubs. Onion routing (what Tor uses) finds paths from sender to receiver. Anonymity and fungibility are improved. 
You could also make the argument that no money has actually changed hands until the channel is settled, in a single peer to peer on-chain transaction. Until then, individual parties are simply passing smart contracts back and forth to each other that any party can submit as an on-chain transaction at any time.
It doesn't take much to run an LN hub. A bit of BTC and a reliable PC. If the resources required to fully verify transactions are kept low, you could run a hub on any hardware that could run a full node - though you'd likely want more reliability than for a simple fully verifying node. And running a hub is economically incentivized to any holder by earning transaction fees. It'll likely be a small amount, but might grow, allowing holders to earn an interest of sorts for staking in the system.
There was also an interesting whitepaper released recently describing further scaling and anonymity improvements to payment channel networks like LN:

The best way to capitalize on selling segwit2x is to move your BTC (as much as you care to) onto an exchange that will make the B2X coin available for trading or selling soon after the fork.
There is custodial risk with your BTC on the exchange, but you won't be exposed to replay if you put your BTC there ahead of the fork, and segwit2x could die so quickly you wouldn't get your B2X from your own wallet onto an exchange after the fork in time to sell it at all.
The Bitcoin Gold fork that just happened is a good example. It doesn't even exist in a usable form, yet, but if you had BTC on the right exchange at the time of the fork you could've sold them for like 0.06-0.07 BTC each. They're down under 0.02 now, and you can still only trade if you had BTC on the exchange at the time of the fork. Bitcoin Gold might never exist for all we know still.

Lightning Network nodes, for example, use onion routing - like Tor - to find a pathway from me to you through any connections between us. Think 6 degrees of separation.
Risks in the way current payment channel protocols work - like bad actors being able to cause your staked funds to remain locked until expiration - push the incentive towards staking channels with amounts that are not very large.
Channels that experience transactions in mostly one direction will need to be replenished more often, with more cost for on-chain transactions, adding more incentive for hubs to arrange in a more decentralized organization.
Barriers to running a hub are relatively low, and it looks like in the not too distant future there may be pools like we have mining pools today, making it even easier for an average holder to participate.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:39:48
That's essentially correct. An off-chain payment would be you and I signing a new Bitcoin transaction that supersedes the previous one we agreed upon, and we'd continue to just hold on to that until we wanted to settle on-chain by submitting the last transaction.
The way the transactions (which are time locked contracts) are structured, neither of us can screw over the other.
A HF that changed anything in Bitcoin that could break how that contract we hold works would have no (forseeable) utility and would clearly be malicious.
If there was some kind of technical issue that required a change, everyone could close out their channels or after the time locks expire (a few weeks) they would revert on their own, and then a HF with consensus could proceed.

@_date: 2017-11-12 14:55:27


Yeah, that's clear. There's a lot more to it, but I'm kind of tired to type it all out.
Segwit already is a block size increase to around 2x (with widespread use).. if large economic nodes like exchanges and wallets would spend a bit of time implementing it instead of pushing for contentious forks that externalize their costs of inefficiency onto the commons. They could also utilize things like transaction batching. There is more than enough capacity available right now, today, if the middle-men companies - the Bitcoin intends to dis-intermediate - would be good stewards of the technology and shared resources. Coinbase doesn't batch outputs or use segwit - they could drop fees across the entire chain by implementing both. Instead they want everyone else to deal with twice the data forever.
Of course we could've had a year to have worked on that if a certain ASIC manufacturing company that also controls a large portion of the hash rate hadn't fought to block activation of segwit for months and months because it disabled a proprietary tech called ASICboost that gave an advantage in electrical efficiency allowing this entity to increase their share of Bitcoin mining over time.
There's some evidence someone (likely a miner) has been spamming the network with transactions to drive fees high and create controversy. At peculiar times, all the supposed transactions filling blocks have vanished. Immediately following the Bitcoin Cash fork, the mempool was quite clear the majority of the time. I guess the spammers got busy with other things around then.
The Bitcoin ecosystem and installations of nodes is wide spread. Unlike alt coins that no one really uses except to trade on exchanges, a hard fork can't be performed in a hurry. In Bitcoin that would inevitably cause some clients to split, and without long lead times it could be many clients.
There are also many important changes that could and should go into a hardfork, if the effort of deploying one is going to be undertaken. And segwit2x with the NYA couldn't possibly go through. The way it was presented was antithetical to Bitcoin.


This is just laughable. Bitcoin Cash is literally one developer.
Here's Bitcoin development: 
Hundreds of people across the globe.
Bitcoin Cash (commits since late July): 
They (he) totally borked the emergency difficulty adjustment, when there are numerous examples of other chains sharing PoW - including Bitcoin and previous SHA256 forks. A mistake like that would not make it into Bitcoin due to the extensive peer review.
When the new difficulty adjustment algorithm came up, modeling showed one algorithm to perform the best, but the primary developer's algorithm was chosen instead (from on high somewhere I guess) despite demonstrated variation from desired results.

Not that this is the only argument for Bitcoin, but I think you underestimate the value of a history of trust and security.
This isn't MySpace and Facebook. People care a heck of a lot more about their money than their photos from last year's drunken Halloween party and their list of contacts from high school.
Everyone who has collectively given value to Bitcoin would have to collectively decide that other alternatives offer better value and move. This doesn't happen overnight.
You mention Ethereum and Litecoin. Both have a public leader of sorts. What would happen to Litecoin if Charlie Lee was hit by a bus tomorrow, or Ethereum if Vitalik Buterin was. Ethereum has certainly had its share of serious issues. Litecoin would be no different than Bitcoin if the volume of transactions all moved over.
With gold, I believe (could be wrong) the price tends to sit just above the cost of production. Cryptocurrency seems to reverse that, causing the cost of production to rise to just below the value. It's a new paradigm. Your concerns are worth considering, but I'm not sure how applicable other models we're used to are.

Andreas Antonopoulos's insightful comment at 2 hours, 11 minutes, and 34 seconds into the video.
Bitcoin sort of already missed the boat for privacy on the base layer. Bitcoin, as is, has significant shortcomings in fungibility and anonymity. Lightning Network can improve fungibility and anonymity significantly, but it is a second layer protocol. Will Bitcoin be more successful at patching it in than lower level network protocols of the past?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:59:35


Not exactly. The other party decided that they don't trust the permanence of the transaction until it's been confirmed 6 times.
6 confirmations is somewhat standard as "definitely permanent", but it's still a decision of risk acceptance and some parties are fine accepting even 0-confirmation transactions.
Engineering involves trade-offs. Updating a global, permanent, immutable, decentralized ledger takes time. Reducing that time has security implications. Bitcoin's value is less in the speed at which a transaction can be confirmed to be permanently recorded, and more in the fact that once confirmed it is assuredly permanent (along with other characteristics like censorship-resistant).

I didn't mean a 25x scaling in and of itself, but that the scaling potential of channel factories rises from 10x to 25x with the addition of Schnorr signatures.
At least, that's how I interpreted:


users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transactions
is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels
opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin
introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.
90% reduction = 10x
96% reduction = 25x

As other people have said, this is likely just Luke Jr. recommending people try to keep the block size as small as possible.
As for your problem not being able to send to bech32 addresses from exchanges, yeah that'll have to wait until your exchanges support it. I know Bitfinex is adding support soon, and blockchain.info before long. There's an exchange or two that already do support it, but I forget which off hand..
In the meantime, you could create a different, non-bech32 wallet in Electrum. Send your BTC there first, then send it from there to your segwit address. A hassle, and doesn't make fees cheaper for that particular use, unfortunately. It's only the one way, though, you should be finding sending from a bech32 address to anywhere (someone please correct me if I'm wrong..).

That was segwit2x which was a doubling of the block weight.
Segwit in fact did get activated 3 months ago, however it is opt in. You have to move your BTC into a segwit address to benefit from it, and Bitcoin as a whole needs large wallet providers and exchanges to implement it to really provide significantly more transaction capacity for everyone.
Instead, those businesses pushed for a doubling of the block weight (size) which pushes the costs for handling that extra data onto every user of the network.
There's a lot more to it than that, but I don't want to bore you.

This is incorrect. When buying on Coinbase via ACH transfer, your buy - the amount of Bitcoin and the price you pay - is locked in immediately. You only have to wait the 5-7 days for the Bitcoin (or Eth or LTC) to be released to you.
For example, in 2 days I'll be getting a Bitcoin I purchased last week 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:11:17
You're looking at the $ price. The BTC trading pair dominates (even though Litecoin &amp; Ethereum in particular have more $ trading pairs, they still are driven by the ratio to BTC).
So, say ETH is trading at 0.045 BTC, when the price of BTC drops, ETH stays trading close to 0.045, so the price drops in ratio with BTC.
Nothing nefarious. It's just that the majority of activity is in and against Bitcoin.

There's a pretty decent dip in the total hashpower between both chains today:

Our confidence in the permanence of a block is based on the total work performed since a transaction was included in a block.
6 confirmations - 1 hour on average - is a rule of thumb in Bitcoin for really, really permanent.
If the block time was 5 minutes, you would still need an hour to have the same level of confidence. 12 confirmations instead of 6.
That said, a shorter average block time does allow more granularity for receivers to determine their own risk level. I might be fine with 1 confirmation at 5 minutes or 2 confirmations at 2 minutes (each) but not 1 conf  min or 0 conf at all, etc.
As others have said, shorter block times can increase orphan rates and re-orgs.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:38:42
It's completely possible that the next crash is from like $50k back down to $15k.
The price is entirely determined by supply and demand on liquid markets. Use as a transactional currency is neutral with regards to supply and demand and doesn't affect the price.
Look at a technology adoption S curve and know that Bitcoin is, at the latest, just beginning the early adopter phase. The rapid spike from $10k to $11k earlier today was caused by a lack of willing sellers in that price range.
It's a bubble by design. That's what drives adoption. Not a desire to spend and transact it, a desire to hoard it and spend only what you need or really want versus the potential future appreciation you'll miss out on. Mass psychology is bootstrapping a new asset and performing price discovery. Only a fraction of a % of people in any country of the world has owned Bitcoin. It's a bubble, but the final maximum is unimaginably high, and really infinite in the long term as population grows and coins get lost.

There is no "actual value." It's value is what someone is willing to pay. It would only go down to where people thought the price was undervalued and bought the dip enough to match the sell orders.
There's been a stark change in collective attitude since the $5k to $3k dip. Perhaps confirmation bias, but it seems there is *a lot* more people vocalizing how they wish the price would dip even just a bit so they can feel better buying more, and you can see this in all the dips since that $5k to $3k. They rebound *hard*. This could just get more and more pronounced as the price rises, reinforcing the "bubble."
Now, there will for probably many years yet always be a threat around the corner that could cause a retraction of 30-80%. High volatility on thin order books can cause huge swings, but they usually resolve quickly. Probably the biggest threat of a large dip is individuals who still own very large amounts of Bitcoin dumping their coins on the market, rather than taking a more reasonable and profitable strategy of selling slowly enough to not clear the order books and crash the price. But then that person is out, and they can't do it again.

The two are unrelated. I was referring to developers changing peering logic in Bitcoin Core to help BTC &amp; segwit2x nodes connect to the appropriate peers ahead of the fork, and having to work on that before finishing segwit support in the Core wallet.
What you're referring to is a common disruption since BCH launched as a result of BCH's emergency difficulty adjustment algorithm. Any time BCH is more profitable to mine (it's difficulty is much lower than BTC's), up to 50% of miners switch over and mine anywhere from 20-50 blocks per hour until the next difficulty adjustment happens on BCH. At that time BTC becomes more profitable to mine and all but a few % of miners return to BTC, restoring block times to normal (usually a tad bit faster than normal, 5-10%).
BCH is hard forking in a couple days to a new difficulty adjustment algorithm that should mostly eliminate the sudden swings in hash rate between both chains.

That was part of my point. I don't think we can reach the level of adoption for $100k Bitcoin while it's still so rough around the edges, though I'll concede some of can be made better through client implementation and not the protocol. But another scenario to consider might be, what if I don't want to accept a payment? Should I have that right? I think so. Can I accomplish that with Bitcoin?
Bitcoin's already so big that changes have to happen slowly and see a lot of contention. I think there's a lot of room for something else to come along well before we see $100k that ultimately dethrones Bitcoin. I'm surprised anyone looking at the market cap of crypto's over this year would argue otherwise.
I'm not pushing any particular coin. In fact, I will never mention the unknown ones I believe in long term here on reddit. Well, maybe not never, but no time soon. I'll just keep acquiring those at lower prices for now and they'll stand on their own merits or not.

Problem is it takes some work for someone who would sell you bitcoin over the internet to securely receive funds from you. You could simply dispute a Paypal transaction and get it reversed, for example. There are escrow services, but first you'll have to find someone familiar with them and then one of those that will bother for $20.
fwiw, I'd sell you $20 of bitcoin, that wouldn't affect my holdings, it's just kind of a bit of hassle. In person for cash or barter, sure no problem.

Bitcoin doesn't need to move fast. Can't move fast. That's what I said. We seem to agree on that point. And that's why it will be surpassed before it ever reaches $100k by something else fresh that implements the many lessons cryptocurrency has learned over the last decade. Stronger encryption, more efficient structures, smarter trust weighting, smoothly curving adaptation, more economically advantageous policies, better governance, larger societal benefits.

If anything's going to happen any time soon in the U.S. on the legal front, it will be approval of a Bitcoin ETF, and that will shoot the price up.
Dollar cost average in over the next 2-6 weeks. Get in before the segwit2x fork block though. It's been a bit since I checked but it should come in early/mid November, but the hash rate has been increasing which could move it earlier. If support for that fork falls apart before then, the price will shoot up, maybe a lot.

If you're trying to get more BTC you should be looking at it in terms of BTC rather than USD. $700+ BCH was when BTC was like $4500+
BCH is also pretty close to it's floor since the first pump. I might wait it out a bit longer for 0.125-0.13. I grabbed some the other day near 0.10 just to wait for the seemingly inevitable rise to 0.13. Nice little 20% grab.
If it breaks below 0.1 I'd sell to cut further losses.

As an aside, if you have any significant amount of Bitcoin, you really shouldn't keep it anywhere that you don't control the private keys. Some online wallets offer safe multi-sig setups, but I don't know that Luno does.
If it's a relatively small amount (which might be the case if the transaction fee is a significant %) then I wouldn't worry about it.
I still think we should expect better of our service providers and nag them about it.

And that's why you're not an arbitrageur.
Obviously you don't literally buy a Bitcoin on one exchange, send it to another, wait for the deposit to confirm, sell it for fiat, withdraw fiat to your bank, then wire that new fiat to the next exchange. That would be ineffective and stupid.
You load up accounts on multiple exchanges with both fiat and coins and replenish as necessary. 
You can even see during periods of high market activity and price movement that occur on, say, weekends and holidays, that the ability to continue arbitraging diminishes and price skew between exchanges increases. 
You can also see price skew on exchanges due to difficulty arbitraging where there are more barriers to moving fiat in and out (Korea, for example).

So you're saying over a 11% fee on the purchase? That's not normal, and nothing to do with Bitcoin. Probably on your exchange or your payment method.


Transaction fees are based on the size of the transaction in bytes which is not related to the value of the transaction, so the fee will be proportionally higher for smaller value transactions.
0.001 is higher than usually necessary. That's on your exchange. The trade off is that you'd also pay 0.001 to send 5000 BTC and Bitcoin has a history of trust keeping many 5000+ BTC transfers safe.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:06:52

Coinbase's multi signature vault might be ok, as you should be able to get your coins even if they disappeared. They are also probably one of the safer online wallets (non-Vault) and insured, but I still wouldn't rely on that.

Of course you can't. Why would you want to?
It's common advice - your private keys, your bitcoin. Not your private keys, not your bitcoin.
Now, that's an absolute view, and in reality Coinbase is imho more trustworthy than many exchanges, but any time you give control of your bitcoins to someone else, it is a risk.
You may want to look into Coinbase's multi-sig vault. I believe bitcoin you store in that you do have control of the majority of keys and can retain control of your bitcoin even in Coinbase disappeared, and they cannot move your bitcoin without your key(s).

Funny, I was going to post a thread to discuss this.
2 days is too short of a time frame to look at. The hashrate has a history of oscillating 10-20% from day to day.
But the total average hashrate *has* gone up 10%+ in the last month. Its rate of increase has accelerated, and I've been curious about it.
Perhaps it's just trailing the price increase. I wonder though where the mining power is increasing, which groups and geographic regions, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:41:08

@_date: 2017-09-01 09:30:30
Well I'm certainly not suggesting the kind of excessive and hidden inflation we've had the last many decades. That would just be *stupid*. Now I'm no economist, but a lot of them think a small, steady amount of inflation is appropriate as we do tend to slowly increase our utility and useful output as a species over the years. 
A more modern crypto might aim for 0.5% and less longer term. We should consider how to incentivize people to continue holding and saving once large scale adoption has occurred, when the value of the coin isn't *inflating* by hundreds of percent each year, or when block rewards aren't *inflating* the supply any noticeable amount. A bit of interest might be a good way to achieve that.
I'd also want to see something more altruistic where part of the inflation and transaction fees went into public funds. Funds to not just continue development, marketing, and technology but if we think of a time when nearly all the world's money is in this system, public funds for the kinds of technological public works programs that can propel mankind forward. Poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food, de-polution, space travel. What would people choose to back if we really had a voice?
That exponential decay of block rewards seems to be a good idea. I might say it's a bit granular. We've seen with BCH how that can cause a decent amount of fluctuation in the rate of *inflation*. A more advanced coin might implement better throttling algorithms on block creation to remain secure, usable, and operating at expected levels despite large changes in the network.
I can imagine a number of places where those exponential curves and weighted averaging could be employed to stabilize the digital monetary system. 
Governance based on stake. Stake measured in a way that doesn't excessively empower large bag holders and rewards continued participation and past history of trustworthiness in addition to economic commitment. Stake used to weight and reinforce encryption.
I haven't even touched on half of the great ideas that not only exist, but have been implemented on forks of bitcoin. Don't even get me started on scripting/smart contracts. We can do so much better than what is popular now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:36

I started buying seriously at the end of June, and in July it dropped over 1/3rd. That lasted all of 2 weeks. It's really, really hard to imagine Bitcoin trading under $5k in 6 months or a year from now.
And what, you're down like $1200, maybe $1500 with fees if you cashed out?
I look back at 2013/2014 and Mt Gox and Bitcoin lost what like 80% of value in USD and took 2 years to regain it. I'm down for that ride, and I don't think there's much chance at all of it being that bad again. Mt Gox was huge at the time, a giant portion of the ecosystem. There's no corollary today. Maybe if the entire U.S. greatly restricted purchasing and selling of Bitcoin. Even then I'm not so sure. China ban wouldn't be as big as Mt Gox.
I keep buying dips. Bought at $4400. Bought at $4100. Bought at $3800. I'll buy at $3600 if we get there. I'd buy at $2000 still.

Fees used to be pennies and less. That's why $4 is now considered high. Also because it makes sending small amounts of Bitcoin unfeasible (are you going to send $1 if the transaction fee is $4).
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:12:17
Do you have any other options besides Luno?
Sucks that they're gouging you. Coinbase kinda does the same thing. It seems that most places you can deposit and withdraw fiat charge high fees.
But for the Bitcoin transactions, there isn't even a need for them too (assuming they actually put it all into the transaction fee and don't skim some for themselves).
Perhaps if enough customers complained about the high fees they would put some effort into implementing a better fee estimation algorithm or offering you a choice between a more expensive high priority fee and a less expensive lower priority fee that make take a couple/few days to get included in a block or they could implement segwit transactions (though they'd still need better fee estimation).
Once you have Bitcoin, though, you should be able to use pretty much any wallet, and can pick one that gives you more control over fees for transactions you make from there on out.

Without an x-axis it's hard to be sure, but this looks simply like the run up in price of Bitcoin lately. Notice it says the chart is in USD value.

Correct. But they pick the amount and you can't change it, and they tend to aim a little high. Right now it's 0.00041 BTC or about $1.75.
Worth pointing out Coinbase does add about 0.5% to the market price of the coins they sell (and take 0.5% off again when you sell the coins back to them), it's sort of a hidden fee and in addition to the 1.49% for ACH or 3.49% for credit card.

Except that it's someone holding up a sign saying I support this chain, not that chain. On one side we have a bunch of miners holding up signs saying I support 2x, and a bunch of nodes holding up signs saying I support 1x.
What will actually matter is the market price. Feel free to interpret this signalling however you like. If the vast majority of people don't care to value the coins routed through btc1 nodes, that isn't going to matter, and vice versa.

How many watts is that antminer, like 1kw? And you're about to have 4 of them?
That's some serious heat. I have experience running grow rooms with 3-4 kw in roughly 10'x10' bedrooms. 
You're going to need to move a good amount of air *through* that room. If you want to keep the door closed, you're going to need a significant size passageway for air to come into the room.
That register also isn't going to work great to take heat out. First, you need to pull a *significant* amount of air through that room to cool 4kw. You're going to need a centrifugal fan, something like [this 8"]( but maybe even a 10" - depends on what kind of pressure you end up with restricting the flow of air (and lowering the flow) and what your intake and ambient temps are.
Second, you can't just point a fan like that straight into that duct and expect any good result. You'll need to direct the airflow in the direction down the duct that it needs to go. Also, is that a return vent? A return can work. If that's an output vent, not going to work very well. You'll also want to pull that heat *directly* off the antminers. Don't just suck air out of the room. Suck it right off the tops of the hardware.
Lastly, 4kw is a lot of heat not just for that room but for the whole house. How many square feet? 4kw of lights adds a *lot* of heat load to a 2000 sq ft house. Going to be *expensive* in warm weather if you recirculate it while using air conditioning in the house. With a grow op, you can't just exhaust heat to the outside. But with mining, it might be an option.
Anyway, 4kw is where you should be considering a mini-split AC.

@_date: 2017-10-23 22:01:51
I didn't mean it as a dig at you, but to hopefully spur some contemplation about what anyone's opinion might be worth on the matter.
I know it's confusing. I'm a lead software developer - CTO actually - and while I'm no OG vet I've been observing quite a while, and I could still make arguments for and against each side. A lot of the debate is not clear cut.
The safest thing to do is simply hold your Bitcoin in a wallet where you have control of your private keys and wait it out a bit to see what happens. Actually, I suppose I should say the safest thing to do might be to sell all your Bitcoin some time before the fork so you're not subject to any volatility, but assuming you want to hold onto your Bitcoin, don't even worry about it.
This is really a unique situation in Bitcoin history, so there's almost nothing similar to draw on for previous proposals and forks. I'd have to go look up what Bitcoin Cash futures were trading at, but that fork was announced much closer to the fork date. If I recall correctly, they were trading at a similar amount - 10-20% of BTC. Right after the fork, Bitcoin Cash hit a bottom of about 6%. There was one big pump a few weeks later up past 15% and it's more or less been bleeding out ever since and is back under 6%.
Segwit2x is different in that it is much less likely to survive at all if it only has a small minority of hash power or market price like Bitcoin Cash.

@_date: 2017-10-23 22:16:23


Playing with fire. I think buying BT1 futures is pretty safe, and had you done it early they came at a 25% discount to BTC (now 15%).
At least with big events like this, Bitcoin Cash, China ban right after almost tapping $5k - it's a bit easier to guess at market directions and have them to be big enough to make some profit off peaks and dips even if you don't hit them perfectly (for example, I bought the shit out of $3500 on the last dip. could've done better and waited until $3k, but I still did a lot better than just holding from $4500+ down to $3500. I still only traded a portion of my holdings though).
Miner signaling doesn't concern me, but people who hold 10's of thousands of Bitcoin potentially have a lot of influence over the market price, at least in the short term.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:59:48
True. I wouldn't say I'm not prepared psychologically, but I don't think I could make any kind of reasonable call if 20k or 50k or 100k is where I should rebalance some percent. It depends on the rest of the context at that time, and what the of future of Bitcoin and USD look like.
If Bitcoin went to $20k tomorrow I'd sell 10%. If it hit $20k near year's end, I probably wouldn't, but if it went to $50k by then I'd sell 5%.

For someone into Bitcoin, talking about authority that way is pretty funny.

Interesting attitude. Bitcoin was built to free people from authority. Miners are expected to act towards their own economic benefit, whatever any individual might think that is. The protocol intends to account for and expects that.

Unless I've made a few order-of-magnitude mistakes, not a chance - not even close. Bitcoin hash rate right now is 23,000,000 TH/s. A GTX 1080 Ti from what I see gets about 4400 MH/s on SHA256. One 1080 Ti is roughly 1/5,000,000,000 of the network hashrate.
There are about 1800 Bitcoins mined each day. That would put one 1080 Ti's share at about 0.00000036 Bitcoin per day, minus pool fees.

Signaling doesn't mean much. It's certainly no guarantee or even promise that the amount of blocks signaling segwit2x means the same % of mining power will switch.
It's widely expected that miners will by and large follow the price/profit. Bitfinex just opened futures markets. B2X is at 25% of BTC.


Probably not, because above. Even if it does, how much does that really matter? I'd say not a lot.

I don't think we'll see anything approaching $3k unless and until there's solid news on China.
What I imagine is that China might dictate new requirements on exchanges and a moratorium on them until they are in compliance.
If that news comes out, I expect we'll dip below $3k but I think we might not go much below that.
If no new news of bans comes from China, I think we might tap $3500 but not much below.
I've been buying at each noticeable dip - $4400, $4100, $3800 - but just some. If we see under $3k I'm all in with all excess cash. If it keeps going further down towards $2k I'll just keep buying as I get more free cash.

Running a full node isn't about decentralization exactly. It's about trustlessness.
Running a full node lets a person verify transactions themselves, without trusting some other person(s) that run full nodes to verify transactions for them.
Now, practically, you're probably still trusting software someone else wrote and hardware someone else created. At least the software has crowd sourced review by being open source.

I'd suggest most people think it will. It already is, obviously.
At some point, and sooner rather than later, we're inevitably speculating. Why 10%, maybe it's 5%, maybe it's 50%. 
You may be interested in various levels of money supply that have standard definitions and sizes you can look up: 
In addition to money Bitcoin and crypto's in general might absorb portions of assets, stocks, property, etc.
Bitcoin is well understood and well tested. It's network effect, I would speculate, has more momentum than if we were to draw an analogue to a popular internet startup. There's less risk switching from MySpace to Facebook. Switching where you store your value has much more weight and risk to the decision. Potentially lose a bunch of photos and text messages, or potentially lose a bunch of money.
I don't know that Bitcoin won't ever be surpassed by a newer currency as the "gold standard" of security, but I think it's much less speculative to think it's got a long run, on the order of a decade, half at least, before that's possible. Would you trust a 5 year old crypto over a 10 or 15 year old Bitcoin to hold your life's savings or millions of dollars?

Well they wouldn't be  if they're trying to liquidate within the first 5 days.
It's also just one exchange, albeit a large one. Coinbase doesn't have trading at all. It's aimed at simplicity and customers who just want to purchase and send a coin, not trade them. Different business model.
They do also offer instant credit card purchase, but at a higher fee. And they just in the past week announced that they are rolling out instant purchases via ACH (at higher risk to them).
Coinbase has a sister site - GDAX - that is more like a traditional exchange where you deposit $ and trade between $ and crypto as you wish, and I believe they don't release the $ at all until the transaction is clear.
GDAX has very limited trading pairs. Most other exchanges operate like GDAX and not like Coinbase.

It doesn't seem to be a very well put together project. More like a money grab, especially with the pre-mine.


There's a lot of history behind this.. I can't do it justice in a comment. I don't know if I can even find a fair summary to point you to (maybe, if so I'll comment again later).
My quite opinionated view: [Segwit was developed as both]( a protocol upgrade to support layer two scaling by fixing transaction malleability as well as safe, gradual block size increase by segregating witness data and allowing that data to be in addition to the 1MB limit on non-witness data.
Segwit had a side-effect of breaking covert ASICboost. ASICboost is a patented, closed technology to increase the energy efficiency of Bitcoin mining. Many feel that this technology gave an advantage to large miners and that miner centralization was already a bit of an issue, so that interfering with ASICboost levels the playing field and is good for Bitcoin overall, even if it is to the disadvantage of a company that excelled in the market by developing the technology.
Presumably, the strong opposition to segwit from miners is due to its disabling covert ASICboost (miners claim do not appear to use non-covert ASICboost and they *claim* they do not use covert ASICboost).
The User Activated Soft Fork movement began and threatened to boot all non-compliant ASIC miners from Bitcoin. This movement appeared to have teeth and forced the hand of stubborn miners to agree to activate segwit.
However, right around the same time the New York Agreement was made between some businesses and miners that if they did activate segwit, a 2x block size increase would then be made 90 days later. Some people think segwit only got activated because of the promise of 2x.

Look at what happened in the 2 weeks following the Bitcoin Cash fork (60% rise in Bitcoin price). Everyone who owns Bitcoin gets an air drop they can trade for 5-15% more Bitcoin. Not all of it will go into Bitcoin, of course, but that creates a much higher than usual demand.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:18:24
Quite a bit. Bitcoin Gold fork is scheduled to happen in about 8 hours, though nobody's really all that sure if that's actually the case, or if it happened already previously, or if it maybe won't be ready and won't actually happen as planned. It's a fork who's main point is to change the proof of work algorithm to one that is does not currently have ASICs developed for it.
Hashpower is irrelevant for this fork since the ASICs that mine Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and the potential future segwit2x cannot be used to mine Bitcoin Gold.
Bitcoin Gold is also supposedly having a significant amount of coins pre-mined, and it has strong replay protection.
segwit2x's main point is to raise the maximum block weight from 4MB to 8MB. It does not have strong replay protection. It is contentious. Hashpower is relevant for this fork, and it will not occur until sometime around mid-November (block 494784).

I think that has a lot to do with it. The belief that it isn't going away is spreading to more and more people. Passing the 2013 peak was kinda a big deal, and the events over this year regarding scaling seems to be well received, proving Bitcoin's anti-fragility and showing that protocol changes can be navigated - even if it isn't perfect just demonstrating the ability to move in any direction without disaster removes uncertainty.
Only a tiny percentage of people own Bitcoin. The potential top is almost unimaginably high. The more people believe it will stand the test of time, the more buy and the higher we go. This can keep going on for a long time.

Thought experiment. What's your opinion on Ethernet's maximum frame size of 1526 bytes? Should we double it?


There are several reasons. With segwit2x in particular, there is strong opposition to the notion that some small group of people can dictate changes to Bitcoin. Philosophically, anyone is free to do whatever they please, including creating a fork that changes the rules, as well as not using that fork coin and/or selling it on the market.
Consensus in Bitcoin is messy. This is all an experiment, and many of these waters have never been charted before. It's practically impossible to get everyone to agree, more so when people have a lot of money at stake.

So what? Even if it did, it would just rapidly reach it's own difficulty adjustment and become less profitable again in a couple/few days. But it won't.

Bitcoin has 8 years of secure history, storing billions of dollars worth of value. Get back to me on  your new cryptocurrency without a blockchain once it's had a similar amount of time safely guarding billions of dollars and then maybe I'll think about switching if it offers more worthwhile. Of course, by then Bitcoin will have 16 years of securely storing hundred(s) of billions worth (we assume).
How's ethereum been doing safeguarding billions of dollars? Showing that new blockchains are easily more trustable or no?
Network effect and momentum is much stronger in crypto than a website. Which would you rather risk: Move from MySpace to Facebook and maybe lose pictures and text messages or move from Bitcoin to CoinWhatever and maybe lose tens of thousands or millions of dollars worth of value?

I've seen some coins implement multiple strategies - PoW that is GPU friendly in addition to PoW that is CPU friendly and produces scientifically useful output along with weighting based on proof of stake and other measures of trust like "was the last block from GPU and is this one from CPU" or "how long has the node that produced this block been on the network and have they had orphaned blocks recently".

Nice. Well there may be a dip from people who want to be out of BTC for the fork and are waiting for a better peak closer to the fork, but who knows what it will be dipping from and to at that point.
Set some buy orders with part of your stash to catch dips at set levels, leave a chunk to buy more on dips at your discretion, and buy a consistent amount on a regular schedule with the rest, imho.
You might also want to take some and trade on the fork futures, too.

Bitcoin's value comes from supply and demand. Demand I would say comes from people's speculation that it will be worth more in the future. 
I'm sure some people believe that Bitcoin will be worth more in the future if and only if it is widely used as a currency one day. Those people may be the majority, or the may be the minority. They may be right, or they may be wrong.

Storage is cheap. Ram's just storage. CPU's don't cost much either, just buy a faster one to keep up with validating if you need. Sure, bandwidth's a bit trickier, but just throw them all together and it'll be no problem.

I don't know about anyone else, but I've been waiting for something under $5200 to buy in again. I'd probably start buying a little in the $5400's at this point.
Problem is, I have been doing my usual DCA buys while waiting, and now I'm getting kind of a big buy in stack piling up. At some point before the fork I'm going to be buying irregardless of the price. I'm afraid if I wait too long, I'll be buying in the midst of a similar and large crowd and at higher prices.

High bandwidth connections in 3 separate physical locations with extra compute resources, so why not.
I actually have to limit the number of connections on my home internet because of a bandwidth cap so I may not keep that one running much longer, but my office has gigabit bidirectional fiber and I have plenty of cloud VM resources at my disposal to host nodes on non-critical VM's. The bandwidth costs are negligible compared to what our business uses. I'm also the CTO so I get to make that decision, and our company values personal freedom and financial independence.

No surprise I got downvoted lol.

There's some smaller crypto's doing really interesting things, some even as continuations of earlier Bitcoin code base.

Your transaction is confirmed when a block is mined including your transaction or after it has been included. A block gets mined every 10  minutes on average (it can vary and is somewhat random). Electrum will show the transaction before it has even a single confirmation. Coinbase waits for some number of confirmations (I don't know how many) before it no longer says "Pending." I often see a couple/few confirmations in Electrum while Coinbase still says pending. If your transaction has been confirmed a couple of times you can be almost completely sure it has happened and is permanent. 6 confirmations is a bit of a rule of thumb for absolutely guaranteed.

The evil of *this* hard fork, of a small group of executives meeting privately and trying to dictate changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Not the evil of 2MB blocks or hard forks in general.
There are concerns to a 2MB block size change right now, but I don't see that being called evil. Unnecessary at this time and pushes costs of inefficient businesses onto the commons at the expense of security.
Concerns to a hard fork, particularly the timeline, the difficulty and coordination required, and the desire to include far more useful features in a hard fork once one is done. Sure, Monero can hard fork every 6 months. It's still small in comparison. Risky, insufficient, unneeded at this time, opportunity cost. Not evil.
A hard fork to change PoW would has even more concerns, and is preferable to avoid, but might be necessary to keep a chain operational. Also not evil. Not desired any more than a 2x hard fork, and would only be performed out of absolute necessity (see the difference). Personally, I'd rather have a PoW change than a 2x block size increase, if we have to hard fork for one single change in Nov.
I think there's a snowball's chance in hell that if this split goes down with two PoW's that money will just keep rolling in to buy (2x) Bitcoin on Coinbase. The whole market will dive, and there will be a bunch of people holding (1x) Bitcoin, running nodes, saying hey so I've got this chain I want to transact but all our miners left, anyone wanna come mine this new PoW? And you'll have a bunch of businesses saying hey so I've got this chain I want to sell coins off of, we've got a lot of miners, anyone wanna come buy our coins? Who's going to remain relevant down the road? How important is Bitcoin as a small-value payment system right now, or for the next year or two? Is that why it's $4000+/BTC?

It sounds like you are saying that the block size should be raised now, because in the future there may be tech that makes the arguments against block size now irrelevant.

@_date: 2017-10-21 21:05:26


Correct. Though it's generally called an exchange, not a broker. These aren't stocks or bonds.
The specific exchange was Coinbase. They allow you to make a purchase via ACH transfer and they lock in the amount of Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum you purchase at the current price, but they don't release the coins to you for 5 business days so they can be sure the transfer has completed.
The risk they assume is *if* your transfer fails *and* the market value of the coin falls it's a negative balance they hold.
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:56:44
What does that have to do with anything? Use your head a bit here.
Let's say btc is sold down to nothing, segwit2x is bought up to $4500, everyone stops mining btc (include bch if you want), core doesn't hard fork proof of work, and segwit2x has all the hashpower and is now btc.
Later, Garzik decides he wants block rewards to be 1 BTC immediately and then drop 0.1 BTC every year until 0. He codes it into github.com/btc1.
How, now, is that change actually effected on the network? What power does the maintainer of the btc1 repository have to force that change to take effect?


Nonsense. If this was true, why did Core have so much trouble getting segwit activated?
segwit2x is just a protocol specification. Anyone who wants can write a compatible client. Control of a repository that implements a compatible client does not provide any power to force future changes to the protocol. Users and owners of hardware are never under any obligation to run your code or protocol.

One example is earlier this year, the two largest dark web drug markets got busted and shut down within a short time span, leaving a massive void of dark net drug activity. The second market had been compromised before the first was shut down, and the exodus from the first to the second was used as a giant honey pot.
Bitcoin price didn't even flinch at that event. Also, Bitcoin is pseudoanonymous. It is not strongly anonymous. Blockchain analysis is already used and continues to improve. Someone who *really* wants privacy and anonymity uses more than Bitcoin, and possibly not Bitcoin at all.

That's not how it works. In order to have a 4MB segwit block you would need a transaction with 3.99MB of witness data. It's not a transaction that would have any real use. Practical transactions have a limited range of witness to non witness data size ratio, and with full segwit adoption and full blocks the average block size in reality will be around 2MB, segwit2x would be double that at 4MB.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:32:28


They feel it so deeply that they've avoided implementing segwit, which would relieve their supposed pains. I don't feel like offloading the costs of garbage apps like SatoshiDice onto the commons. Sure, gamble away, no problem with that. But not at mine and everyone else's expense who wants to have decentralized, anti-fragile, censorship resistant money.

Going out on a limb, but neither are you familiar with the intricacies of Bitcoin and blockchain and the effects of block size. More dangerously, it seems simple enough, so people tend to think they can have an informed opinion when they do not.


By what measure? The only measure of consensus in favor of segwit2x so far is signaling in mined blocks, which means very little. Every other measure of segwit2x support I've seen has the opposite ratio in opposition.
Miners are constrained by economics and ongoing costs. "Support" via signaling will mean next to nothing if the market values the two chains at the proportion futures are currently trading at.

Oh, so you mean market cap. That's just as wrong if not more so. Market cap is simply the current price of one coin times the total number of coins. A change in market cap does not equal the amount of money coming in. $1B at $5500 would be 180,000 BTC. If 180,000 more BTC were bought than sold in a single day, or if $1B more flowed in than out in a single day, the price would be astronomical. Many multiples of where it is now.

There are methods to obfuscate the history of bitcoins, like tumbling, or transferring through other strongly private chains like Monero.
You do have to sell it to someone or through an exchange. Exchanges that will buy your bitcoin for USD are going to comply with AML/KYC laws and if you test that you will likely end up in the same position as your friend.
I personally would buy the bitcoins to hold as a long term investment with the expectation that my ability to divest them later without getting flagged by the government would improve. It's already not too tough to find people to buy Bitcoin for cash, with higher demand and value that may become easier. With high enough demand and value that may not be necessary at all. I also expect more ability to purchase goods directly in the future, and expect features like atomic swaps and private transactions to improve my ability to hide the history of my Bitcoin in the future.
In your position, I wouldn't buy the bitcoins if I needed to exchange them for cash in the near future. Not until you have very little doubt how to do so without significant risk.

A hard fork with supermajority consensus works that way, as an upgrade. Forks like Bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold with full replay protection, or possibly contentious forks like segwit2x, do not.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:31:40


Essentially, yes (it exploits patterns in the data). And then the large portion of hashpower gained through that advantage has been used to impede progress the users at large wanted (I'll admit there's some assumption in that statement) - i.e., segwit was effectively blocked from activation for many, many months until people got fed up and threatened to USAF. The same bad actors tried the same thing on Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:36:15


Maybe the people who are so pained by small blocks should invest some time implementing segwit, instead of pushing the costs of their inefficiencies onto me. 
They could've started on this more than a year ago if the same people pushing for 2x hadn't blocked activation of segwit in the first place.

If you send your whole amount to another blockchain or two and back, it is still fairly easy to deanonymize you based on the amount alone. Amounts need to be split and delayed randomly, at the least.

Doesn't sound like opposite.
They said they will provide access to Bitcoin Cash. Access meaning simply the ability to withdraw it.
They've now said they will provide access to both sides of the Nov fork. They are doing it more quickly this time. I don't read anything into that beyond them learning how much customer demand they would receive for access to the airdrop from the previous fork.

I think we have a good idea what will happen: 
There's a noticeably higher % of miners mining BCH than the last few EDA cycles, and with the price action happening, it might be some miners who wouldn't normally mine BCH milking it before it's totally dead and trading their BCH rewards for BTC.

Most people find they would've just made more if they held the whole time instead. You buy and then you sell and then you have periods where you miss out on rises because you're holding nothing or waiting to reach break-even. And you pay fees on most trades.
It's a trope for people to regret trying to day trade, but some people need to learn that through first-hand experience and some people come out ahead.

That's not a price that's quantity - how many of longs are open, in BTC's I believe. 30k BTC in long contracts. This is all fuel for downward price movement when they decide to close - whether that's as the price goes up and they're in profit or when the price goes down and they need to be closed to prevent further losses.

Exactly this. It always surprised me that you could buy crypto on credit cards like purchasing a normal good. It is essentially pulling out cash, with the added risk of volatility.


After this plus the late disclosure of changes to cash advances, their latest coin launch, and their self-imposed dust problem I wonder how many more ways can they screw up. Such incompetence.

Nope. Bitcoin has all of the necessary protocol features to support what's being developed for lightning. There may be some future enhancements in mind that might, say, require new op codes, but I don't have any off the top of my head, just vaguely recall reading that before.
Lightning Network basically just lets parties exchange signed bitcoin transactions with time locks in the future in a way that the receiver can always broadcast the last message you exchanged to be included in a Bitcoin block and redeem the fair balance with all the security of on chain transactions and as the sender the time locks are structured in such a way that the receiver at worst can cause you to wait for those to expire before your locked funds are returned to you. There's a minor caveat or two and I've probably slaughtered the description.
In addition to the p2p time locked transaction structuring and exchange, there is a routing protocol similar to tor that finds routes for payments through any existing intermediaries in the Lightning Network, where each node only knows the one previous and one next node providing better anonymity and fungibility.

I was going to ask if that's even profitable as I've heard it's really got to be sub 10 cents, but I suppose I should ask which chain - I assumed BTC but maybe LTC? Or have you worked out how long it'll take to break even at 15 cents?
I'd have to pull out my bill but I'm pretty sure I pay less than 15 per kw/h after taxes and fees and crap, even when I was running 3000W 12 hours a day.

Dude, I already addressed volume previously. You said $1B came into bitcoin. Volume was $1B. Volume is *total* volume. All trades. Both into and out of bitcoin. Every single trade, purchase, and sale. Not just money coming in. All money changing hands in every direction. That is not $1B coming into bitcoin.

The reward measured in Bitcoin diminishes over time. The expectation is that the *value* of the reward in purchasing power remains at a level that makes disrupting the network through hashpower attacks prohibitively expensive.
So far, the value of the reward has *far* outpaced the reduction in rewards in BTC.
Bitcoin is also, arguably, over-protected at the moment. That is, the network would still be safe with less hash power.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:40:26

It is exactly about power and politics. Bitcoin refuses to allow people the power to announce of their own accord that "this is how it is now" and make changes to the protocol.

What's a "lucrative" retirement fund? Not just a "maintain my standard of living," you want "lucrative".
Let's say I could put all my money in a safe, stable investment when I retire with 5% annual returns.
Let's say, I have $15 million saved. At 5% that retirement would provide $300,000 of annual income.
That's maybe lucrative today. Suppose it depends on your frame of reference.
In another several decades, that may not be lucrative at all. It may be maintain my standard of living, maybe even less.
Still though, that means Bitcoin would have to increase in value 10,000x. $50,000,000 per Bitcoin.
Unlikely, even if Bitcoin takes over world commerce. Highly unlikely overall.

People will continue exiting if the ratio continues falling. Get much under 0.1 and people will be expecting back down to 0.05-ish and accelerate the process. It would probably oscillate a while around it's all time lows, but the longer it goes without a pump the more people will give up. I would guess by 2019 it's trading for more like 0.02 than 0.2.

You're still wrong. Segwit with wide adoption is predicted to lead to an average block size around 1.7MB, with a maximum just under 4MB - but this would never happen with normal use, only with specially crafted transactions whose sole point is to use all the space possible. Segwit 2x is predicted to lead to ~3.5-3.8MB blocks with wide adoption, with a max of 8MB (same conditions).

Supply and demand determines value. Not mining difficulty.


I suggest you've mis-framed this entirely. Did I even mention nodes anywhere?
Nodes don't have any "say" in the way you mean it. People who buy and sell Bitcoin do, though. 
Mining difficulty is one (small) factor some people might consider when determining whether or not to buy or sell bitcoin.

If that all holds true, sure it does seem like a better deal. Though you could've just bought just about 0.75 BTC for that same price if you caught the bottom of the recent dip to $3k.
Where are you going to run them, just at home? Many would recommend putting them in a data center. Are you sure your electric will be that cheap when you're pulling that many kWh? Many places have tiered costs that rise as you use more. Have you considered cooling? 3-4 kW is a decent heat load for an average house. Do you have the technical skill to set up your equipment reliably and securely? Monitor it? Have you accounted for all your time, especially if something isn't working right? Risk of equipment failure. Risk of difficulty rising faster than you estimated. Pool fees. etc.

I know at least that sending coins to some addresses can get your account terminated at common fiat on/off ramp exchanges, potentially making coins that have traveled through blacklisted addresses worth less. I think in practice so far accounts are only banned if the purchasing account sends to a blacklisted address, but it's not much of a leap to ban accounts selling coins from blacklisted addresses too.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:22:20
Signaling and then not mining the segwit2x chain is not deceptive in and of itself.
Signaling doesn't mean a whole lot, really. You could say it means a miner is ready to support a change. But it might not; they don't have to be running fully compatible software to signal. It can mean "support" in a variety of ways ("I want this outcome" vs. "I'll go along with this outcome if everyone else does") but it doesn't necessarily mean that, either.
Some miners still signal for things that became irrelevant more than a year ago, for example.
Real support is likely to follow the market value.
