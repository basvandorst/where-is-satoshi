I think ShapeShift has an API that you could take use of. It should let users pay with the supported altcoins and you could still receive bitcoin.

Here in Norway we have smartphone apps which makes paying for parking very easy.
You just connect your CC to your account and then you can easily pay for parking.
You get notifications when parking time is running out and can add additional time if wanted.
If you dont use up your time you can just end parking and you are credited for the time you didnt use.
I guess most of this is possible with bitcoin also, but how can the last point be solved, with being credited for time you didnt use if you end your parking earlier then planned?
Edit: Nvm, shouldnt be a problem really

Im just wondering why it always would have to be 10mins. Wouldn't future tech and such make it so that a lower block time would be possible without todays problems?
Like back in the 80s where one would say 256kb of RAM would be more then enough and one couldnt see the need for more? I guess its a bad comparison, but you probably get where im going.
It seems good enough for today, but will it always be? And can it be changed without any major problems if needed?

This isnt a regular SD card though. It's a minicomputer with an SD card. It got an ARM processor and NFC among other features. So my understanding is that this gives much more possibilities then bitsim as mentioned.

If I host a full node on my home network, wouldn't my IP be publicly known? Is this going to make any security problems for me?
If I buy an USB miner, would it work as a node itself, or do I need to connect it to my full node in some way? (A link explaining this would be appreciated)

I guess we need to wait and see if they have any success with their initial testing. Atleast it seems to me that that this have the potential to be a big deal.

I've got a little multiplayer browser based game that I had bitcoin payment integrated to.
* Pay 250 bits to enter.
* The winner takes it all.
I had this set up and working with the Coinkite API earlier, but right after it went live, Coinkite had problems with zero confirmation transactions, and they don't have any plans to have it working:


So my questions: What would be the best alternative API to Coinkite when it comes to accepting 0-conf transactions?
If I set the game up with some other API, would there be a chance that it suddenly would not work anymore because of some planned protocol level change (The 0-conf transactions)?
Would the 21.co micropayment solutions be something to consider for something like this?
@_date: 2016-09-01 21:05:10
From their FAQ:
"5. How do publishers get paid?
Your monthly contribution is split among the sites you visit as you browse. The Brave browser calculates the percentages based on a combination of how many pages you visit and how much time you spend on each site."
"9. How do I collect my payments as a publisher?
When contributions for an individual publisher are equal to about $10.00 USD (in BTC, of course), an email is sent to both the webmaster of the site and the registered domain owner. The email explains how to verify your bitcoin wallet with Brave Software. (If the publisher doesn't already have a bitcoin wallet, the email explains how to create one.)
Verification of a bitcoin wallet with Brave Software is a lot like verifying a domain name: Brave Software generates an unpredictable token and the publisher uses that token and their Bitcoin address to construct a TXT record in the DNS that Brave Software verifies."

The entry fee is 250 bits. Min 2 player and max 5 players per round, and the winner gets all entry fees combined payed out to the address he used when entering.
Unfortunately it seems like there is an ongoing problem with getting the payments registered correctly with the Coinkite pay button that the game takes use of, and this is due to the malleability attack on Bitcoin that is taking place right now. Currently looking into how this can be solved.
As for crowdfunding a better game, I don't have much more then what is sketched up at

Could be. But if you dropped the betting I'm not sure if it would break any rules? Sarutobi is on iOS and pays in Bitcoin.
I'd like to see something like this for PCs, not only mobile devices. There wont be any restrictions on the PC platform. If one could make it a Facebook app also that could make it interesting.
And for android you could drop the playstore if its a problem, and just release the .apk elsewhere. Exposure wont be the same, sure.. But still.

My bitcoin integration in  is relying on 0-conf transactions. It's using Coinkite's API for handling this. 
But after this malleability attack ( 0-conf transactions haven't been working for me, atleast not with Coinkite.
