If it gets to $500 I'm gonna fucking purchase a shitload of bitcoins

I have some problems setting up my account and it's killing me seeing the price go higher 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:09:18
Do they take any fees? If yes do you know how much?
Paxful also has their own escrow I think
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:17:26
That's like 4-5 big houses in my country

hey man just wanted to ask, I got Electrum too, if by chance I format my PC, do I have to backup my wallet in one USB? And what should I do after that?
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:01:01
Localbitcoin or paxful

Thanks man a lot, really appreciate it :)

This might sound like a noob question but where should I create my wallet or how does it work?

Hey man, I was the same boat as you a month ago, I spent half of my money as soon as I could and then waited a week to see if the prices change or anything to spend the other half. Hope that helps :)

Can somebody tell me what's a fork? And can I just leave my btc in my Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:01:52
What the hell?
Edit: Everything is good now again
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:16:43
damn I feel bad for you man, I hope you somehow win it back
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:42:13

@_date: 2017-09-28 20:16:44

@_date: 2017-10-09 23:49:41

I'm using Electrum wallet too, what kind of wallet should I use to be more secure?
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:34:13
I use Windows too, what should I do? Also what is the 2FA for Electrum? Is it the password and those seed words?
Is there a way anyone can hack my Electrum wallet without using my PC?
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:10:06
How much does it cost? And is it safe?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:55:43
I got another question tbh, is the_Donald a satiric subreddit or a serious one with Donald Trump voters?
