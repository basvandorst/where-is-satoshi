I placed an order with Coinabul early in May, I am very sorry that I didn't research the company.. i will be surprised if the stock ever arrives. It is my belief that Coinabul is a scam and I would advise people not to order from this company. They claim 17 working days... they are at double that and not replying...
WALK AWAY!!!!

If the dollar was in real trouble how would we know? would there be an announcement or would we just see certain signs? What form would the signs take?
Is this one of them?

Read Cryptocoin news today! Coinabul just got hit with a class action.. the company is Ellison Law, the company that took the Mt Gox class action. Maybe you should join them, I bought gold in early May, nothing. It's a scam company.

There is nothing to see there. Literally nothing... What would happen if the politicians went in and the gold was missing? Come on... work it out...ah...There!

WU will do whatever it takes to dominate the payment transfer technology, if they move to develop this technology, it'll work.

The problem clearly lies in the number of people holding Bitcoin as an investment. The more hoarded, the more the value of the coin goes up. It's a currency first and foremost. If everyone e must spend bitcoins for it to succeed.

I bought stuff from Coinabul, two months later, nothing! If I paid by PayPal, Escrow or any of the major Credit Cards I would have my money back, Now, I have nothing. I paid by bitcoin!
Do the people who lost their coins with Mt Gox enjoy the same legal status as if they had lost cash? I don't think so. There should be a governance that a proven transaction can be reversed. How do do it won't be simple though.

If they're any good, they wouldn't be for sale.. DOH
