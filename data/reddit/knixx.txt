I've taken out my "invested" capital ages ago. I've also taken profit from time to time. Any cash I make now is just a bonus on top of the bonus.

Kraken shit itself again. Can't place an order as usual. I have no idea what the price is at, It's been locked at 18150 for 15 minutes lol

I can send you some bitcoin if you want. A small amount over PayPal is fine. If you're an ass and charge back I'll let everyone here know :D
I'll just charge the cost price for me to send it to your wallet.

When you request money via Bitcoin Core the request will be added to a list.
It should be under requested payment history
Is there anything in that list?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:18:13
I've been holding for ages, this is entering sell territory I must admit :P.
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:55:40
Yesterday i was looking at the price $1060~. Thought, yea it's going to drop, I'll buy tomorrow.
Get up today. Price is at $1080. In frustration i buy $100 bitcoin :).
Then it pops up to $1095.60.
This is stupid lol

I've had a support case with them and it got answered in around 24 hours. But that's the only time I've had to contact them.
Coincidentally, I emailed my ISP the 20. November last year and got a reply today :P. But my question was really for 3rd Level support which takes a hell of a lot more time.
Point is, depending on what you asked support about, maybe it just took that long to find the best dipshit?

Honestly south Africa sounds bad. But at least you didn't send your passport. That is worse.
I'm not sure how US laws regulate the use of a driver's license as ID, but worst case it's only useful in the USA. A passport on the other hand can be used world wide.
I won't give anyone my passport unless it's an organisation in my own country. Definitely not to a private person and definitely to not to anyone but an airport or official authority overseas.
Worst case they can abuse it in the US, but unless identity theft is the main goal I doubt it's a big problem. I can understand your concern though.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:43:05
Maybe I've misunderstood something, but it seems you paid: 26.882 sat/B
That would put you in the 21-40 category here:
Which means it will take quite a bit of time.
Transaction fees have been rising quite a bit lately, its a shame :(
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:18:38
Much more cost effective to transfer say $100 via bank transfer than doing lots of small credit cards purchases on Coinbase.
But the credit card gives some extra flexibility as you get what you need right there and then.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:57:09
That's what I've been doing, SEPA transfer, but I'm still on Coinbase. Maybe I'll switch to Kraken myself.
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:29:48
Also, if you are going to send money with Bitcoin Core be sure to increase the transaction fee. The default took nearly a day before i figured it out.
It's on the same window where you send bitcoins. There is a slider there, just move it slightly past the middle and it should be good enough.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:02:51
Would never buy a fiat!
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:50:18
That's a shame, but honestly. You paid for something and didn't bother to check if you got it?
Maybe you gave them the wrong Bitcoin address and it's long gone.....

If you had any money in your Coinbase account, did you get it back?
@_date: 2017-01-27 06:37:30
I've been using Coinbase for about a month. Got €160 sitting in there, so i have some cash to splurge when i feel the price is right. So far I haven't had any problems getting Bitcoins out of my account. 
This post does seems to suggest that it's best to keep as little funds as possible in Coinbase. My Coinbase limit on my Debit card is too low to only use that, but once that limit goes up I'll dump my Euro into Bitcoins and just purchase with the debit card. At least that way I'm holding my funds not them.
Hope you get your Coins. It's such a shame for Bitcoin that companies can behave like this. Making Bitcoin easy and safe to purchase is a big step in getting it mainstream.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:54:18
The main thing is that you own your coins. Putting your personal wallet.dat file in the cloud is much better than having your coins with a 3rd party.
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:45:36
Depends when he purchased. If he picked up his coins for 1k then yea, that sucks. But if he made a lot of cash I'd say he's the one with laughing rights...
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:39:29
Usually because you don't "own" your coins when it's in the cloud. They are in someone elses wallet.
So if they go bust, have weird requirements for withdrawal and so on you can't get your coins. That's the major risk in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:34:03
Firstly, unless someone is truly interested in learning about Bitcoin they are just not going to put in the time to "convince" themselves. You're beating a dead horse there to be honest.
I'm also married and knowing the last thing my wife wants to talk about is Bitcoin I put it to her this way about a year ago - pretty bluntly.
I want to speculate on Bitocoin. I'd like to put up $2000. The returns over the past few years have been good and it seems like a fun way to use some of our "sleeping" capital (Banks gives sweet **** all interest these days)
She agreed that we could spare $2000 and that losing it wouldn't impact us in a negative way and that was that.
Don't ask for more than your current economic position will allow you to loose with a "big" safety margin. then it won't seem as scary to your spouse (You shouldn't really call her a old hag lol). At the end of the day you also commit to the family savings and should have a say on where some of it is spent. Just don't be unreasonable and it should be ok.
I might add in that even though your are considering averaging over time ($100 each week) agreeing on an initial investment sum can give you some predictability. It also gives you more flexibility without having to grovel if you need to spend more a certain week (if the price plummets, for example.)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:27:32
Such is life. You can't blame your mum though. 
It's a sanity check that she doesn't just say - "Yeah I heard of Bitcoin. Let's do it!"
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:08:11
Always a good idea to cash out a little bit. I've picked up a new PC and paid the credit card a few times. Not to mention cashing out my initial outlay.
Hope you are still in the green mate :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:06:01
I've been on the fence. But Time to sell 5% of my crypto. If it still goes lower I'll buy more. If not I'll buy a new TV.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:00:28
Just buy from somewhere else.
Okcoin in China maybe?
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:29:27
Of course. The technology used to secure Bitcoin is also used to secure communications throughout the world. civilian, military you name it.
Braking the current models for encryption and verification would give a country access to all world wide communication they could intercept.
Believe me when I tell you that all the major super powers are working on this problem everyday. Including private security researchers and academics. 
With that being said our current standards are presumed to be strong enough for a very long time. At least with our current technology.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:16:50
They use a FIFO ticket system so they haven't got to you yet most likely. And yours is more than a general inquiry and would have been forwarded to a different team. Which takes time.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:39:09
Still speculation. Closed source is frowned upon, I get that, but even the most important open source projects fail - Openssl for example.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:07:57
The 12 words are your backup. To test Download the app onto another device. Plug in your 12 words passphrase and you will have the coins on that device as well.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:29:50
$150 isn't much and your losses are also decreased by a large margin because of that. So don't feel too bad.
But definately pick up some cheapers coins if you get the chance, i mean why not :).
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:49:23
I had to keep hitting the buy button over and over again on Kraken, but eventually got a buy order In at €2060 last night.
But yeah Kraken sucks when there is heaps of activity. Just falls over and dies.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:29:11
I'll be buying on Monday ;). Hoping to get in early haha :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:24:09
But doesn't this ring true for all wallets where you haven't downloaded the entire block chain?

I wasn't around for the moon landing, but I'm damn sure glad to be here for this crazy Bitcoin tech which will be in text books when my kids go to university.
(I'll get on board.) .......To the Moon :D
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:58:29
I know, but do you and millions of others audit the software before something bad happens?
I'm no advocate for Jaxx, I use it because of its flexibility (PC and Mobile app), but only for "Hot" cash. Just keep in mind that an option to audit doesn't make open source more secure.
Time and time again I've seen massive open source projects make terrible mistakes, either on purpose or by accident.
My point is, don't blindly trust an application because it is open source. But you should without any doubt place you trust where you are most comfortable and I respect that :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:18:28
If "she was told" by someone other than her fiance and the fiancee hasn't left her instructions to recover it then I'd say it's gone for good.
There are a multitude of ways to store bitcoin. Everything from a paper print out to an online account. Needle in a haystack.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:33:36
Ok thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:23:53
I plan on buying but this bull run is insane.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:02:08
It's highly speculative. It has a history of going up and has always passed previous "All time highs" even after a substantial market crash. So if we were to look at historical events one could conclude that you could buy any amount of bitcoin right now and expect it to pass $2800 or whatever the previous high was at some stage.
But as we all know there is no way to predict the future. For example, a massive bug in the code affecting the cryptographic parts of the currency would send it's price down to 0 pretty quickly.
It's highly speculative no one can give you anymore advice than look at it's history and make your own decision.
If you can't write off the 5k then you can't invest the 5k. Remember that it could disappear just as fast as it could grow to 3 or 4 times the invested amount.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:12:44
I'm running the official Bitcoin node software on Ubuntu as described on Bitcoin.org.  will that have the Segwit update? Or do I have to source a new copy from github or something?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:46:46
Instant, but as others have said. The fee is steep :(
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:48:57
Link a credit card to Coinbase? Then buy etherium and use that on Gdax or send it somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:36:47
Why can't another "thin" wallet do same thing, why only Jaxx. If the wallet doesn't​ know your private key then It can't confirm you own a transaction?
How is Mycelium or Bread wallet any different to Jaxx?
The only difference I see is that Jaxx is somewhat closed source. If that's all this is riding on then it's pure speculation unless you have reviewed the code yourself which noone does.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:10:32
That I should have made my bank deposit to the exchange on Thursday instead of Friday....(takes a day to clear not including weekends).
So can't trade before Monday...
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:15:41
It's a possibility for sure. The first time I transferred I checked the account numbers and the ID tags and everything with copy paste and find in the browser multiple times. I saved them as a contact in my bank and everything has gone smoothly for all consecutive transfers.
Bank transfers are usually in next business day for me.
I hope it works out for you OP. I'd be pissed if my €200/300 euro transfer disappeared. I can't imagine how you feel with 10k. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:08:42
Someone breaks the crypto securing the entire platform - public key cryptography, for example.  That would kill it the moment it was public.
But keep in mind that it would also kill alot more than just Bitcoin. The entire economic platform our digital world is based on would crumble.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:07:16
Bitcoin is a digital currency and its value is derived from the people who own it, use it and want to buy it.
Goto Bitcoin.org to get a quick intro to what it is and how it works.
Your friends most likely don't understand the technology and therefore call it a scam, but that's what most people call things they don't understand or are afraid of.

Fair enough. Must be on their end I guess. Shame.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:22:04
You not the only one :).
A few months ago was when I got into crypto. I picked up a chunk of LTC, ETC, DASH, Bitcoin and ETH.
Then Bitcoin, DASH and ETH doubled in value and I thought - Hot damn. Sold it all. Payed off the credit card and got a new PC. After a few weeks of no movement I decided I'd made a nice chunk of change and cashed out my LTC and ETC as they weren't doing much. Little did I know all of the currencies are 10x more valuable today than back then.
So yes. If I just held onto I'd have more cash, but with that being said it could have gone down and I would have lost a nice chunk of change.
Always think profit. Or just Hold.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:42:03
Try with chrome or their app. I know for a fact it doesn't work with Firefox if I'm paying by credit card.
I rarely use them, but when I do it usually doesn't work (credit card)
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:06:09
Well it's forward upon for algorithms, but plenty of closed source security software making the world tick. But we are in agreement, so I don't think we need to go around in circles. 
Good to let people know Jaxx is closed source. Like I said above, I use it for hot cash and I think it works well for that. I don't use it for my savings. I actually have a full node for that. Not offline, but I think it works well and trust the Bitcoin client.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:30:39
I'm not sure if I'm so optimistic, but I hope you are right!

They are :(. I ordered 2x Ledger Nano S last month. Supposed to ship the 25th Of this month. Long wait!
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:00:35
I have 2 on order. This is my plan:
1. One that's setup and has all my stash at home.
2. 2nd one at my in-laws for safe keeping. It won't be initialized though.
3. A copy of the seed with be at both home and in-laws on printed paper. It won't be stored with the Ledger.
Wife is informed of locations so she can get it which is important to me. The uninitialised ledger is in that state because I then don't need to keep my wife updated on the pincode.
I know ledger uses a standard restore code which can be used in other wallets, but that's what I've decided to do.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:45:23
I use Kraken. I've found their support to be decent. The only major problem I've encountered is that they usually go offline when trading volume is very high. People spamming their API bring down the website, so us humans can't trade.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:03:33
I totally get that. Definitely missed opportunities.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:44:06
Seems they do extra checks with very large transfers. It's a common complaint on Reddit.
I have never had a problem but I've never transferred more than €350 at a time.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:25:57
It's website is always unresponsive when big stuff happens.
The only real way to do anything is to have pre-set purchase/sell orders as they all work as intended.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:49:26
It's definitely worth putting in a few 100s if you can afford it. But Bitcoin is so expensive no one should expect big returns in the short term if they are only buying fractions of a bitcoin or even half of one. 
With that being said: One tip I have to get people on board is to send them some Doge Coin. I got my mates to get a wallet on their phones and then i gave them both 1000 Doge. Over the coarse of a few weeks we would "bet" Doge on various things (I bet 50 Doge can't do X and so on). After a while they thought it was good fun and then got some Bitcoin. Then got some Eth and the rest is history.
Doge Coin is fun for newcomers because they can get their hands on a large chunk for a few $$. Then get used to the eco system and how everything fits together.
