Yea. Diversification never hurts. I have money in BTC and alts

There isn’t really a correct percentage. It’s just how you want to spread it. IMO I think that is a lot. But it’s up to you on how much to diversify and on what alt you want.

Yea it can adapt. We just don’t know what it’s full capability can be. I’m sure you’ve heard about ppl comparing it to gold as a store a value. That’s what can happen to it. It’s really hard to tell what will happen, but the reason why everyone is so interested is because of its potential to be global currency. Another way I see it is this; bitcoin can be global because it is easier to send 1000 BTC than go through the hassle to send the USD equivalent over seas. Then you can have another crypto like LTC for our day to day transactions. Just some examples of its potential.

Nothing. Bitcoin is bitcoin. Currently one of a kind. Won’t really know what will happen until 2020 or until someone creates something better. Most likely won’t happen because many people are working on BTC to improve it instead of starting from scratch.

When you generalize the term to that extent then yes. You can also invest in a savings account. So what you are saying is that those 3 are the same. Many things have similarities, doesn’t make them the same or behave the same or valued the same.

Moving from gdax to other exchanges is free. They pay the cost of transfer. 
If you are withdrawing from wallet you pay a fee to the miners.

Any other proof besides this?

I’m sure they knew they were going to have competition. They have years of experience with BTC behind them. BTC is a lot larger than other cryptos. I’m sure if those cryptos were as large scale they would be having issues as-well.

Bitcoin isn’t a stock.....

Yea you will have a fee. They only cover the fee leaving from gdax. There also is no fee going from coinbase to gdax and vice versa.

Right. It’s created but it has to tested to max capacity. They don’t want to release a broken product, that would be devastating. Not only does it have to be functional and quick but there is also a huge security aspect to LN. Last thing you want is a transaction within minutes but gets hacked. If that happens you’ll be saying you’d rather wait and have high fees than lose your BTC. Patience is a virtue. Let them work and test so they can release a fully understood and functioning LN.

Agree with ppl on here. Bitcoin is more of a store of value. It’s kind of saying like let’s use gold once in a while to keep its value. That’s why many ppl say bitcoin is gold.
