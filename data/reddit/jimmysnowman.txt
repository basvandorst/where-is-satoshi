deposits - bitcoin deposits are automatic and happen continuously. We require three confirmations before crediting your account with funds. This can take around 1.5 hours. Please check in the Blockchain for the status of your transaction.

A few years ago I had 4 R9 270X in my Kitchen mining VTC, effectively drying all my washing :)

Its almost as if some folks have no idea what they are getting into.

Confirm it's scannable ;)

Well. Don't sweat it.

So someone is trying to block the price from going up by creating such a wall? OR ensure the price goes up by ensuring there are no offers lower than that? Sorry trying to get my head around it.

Or there are so many transactions backlogged that they cannot process 'shapeshifts' in time, so are disabling it for now?

Have your cake..and eat it!

Can you ELI5 such a wall and what it signifies? Thanks!

In a tissue?

That is one gorgeous bike.

Then I hope you get it. For it's worth a lot. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:42:06
Is there a reason not to claim it? Even if to just send elsewhere (e.g. Shapeshift) and convert back to BTC for a free boost!?

Assuming this ain't bullshit: don't do anything now, you'll likely make a mistake and don't trust anyone with your wallet.dat / private key.

A joke right?
