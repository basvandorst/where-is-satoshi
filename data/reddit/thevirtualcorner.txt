The plea deal must have been really good. Otherwise what stops someone from claiming losing the private key

Finally some fucking sense in this sub! Should bitcoin be a currency or gold? Its purpose keeps flip flopping depending on transaction fee that month :/

Salty or not he makes a decent point. Bitcoin and crypto still needs to undergo heavy and serious regulation to see if it can still exist outside of regulation. What will happen if one day EU decides bitcoin itself should be banned and possession of it is equal to possessing drugs? That’s an extreme situation but unless crypto is 100% regulation proof there’s always that shadow looming. And then again piracy, drugs and black market arms are all illegal but they still exist, so let’s where how and when bitcoin can handle regulations
