if you imply my post has low general quality: what would give greater quality to my post?
if you imply they see the post: who are they? do they actually see it? reddit sees it? who sees all this stuff?? does that/those entities get to have names? who / what is watching all of this? are you gonna simply name it "god"  or "allah" and forget about it and try to calm down? each person, entity, whatever - it's a giant crowd of people that you're representing here?

Nah Bitcoin protocol can change over time. Maintain the supply but change the protocol to permit privacy.
I don't think Bitcoin folks should exchange for shitcoins. I think Bitcoin folks should change their protocol with their fixed supply to be something that is better in their interests.
Do you get the concept? What is your purpose to comment here? I don't understand your mindset.

Yes, it appears to be deleted from my perspective.
Amazing you were able to translate my words.

where? who has the good physics? wanna prove it? show me? physics? where is physics? where can i find physics?
edit: not sure if this is off-topic for Bitcoin subreddit. Who thinks physics is on-topic? I deleted my drug related comments below since I consider them off-topic, I assume physics is also off-topic.
