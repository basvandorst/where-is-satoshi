I say the complete opposite, hold the coins and BUY BUY BUY. The only reason it's dropping is because of the massive sell off from scared speculators only looking to bank short. Watch everyone shoot themselves in the foot next week.

Fair enough, but those who are pressured into selling are just perpetuating the self-fulfilling prophecy of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. I don't think it will drop that low but who knows at this point. 
A month ago I was amazed it shot up to $200, sure enough it went on to quadruple in growth, no one saw that coming.

It is tedious at first, but simple over the long run. At this point, all it needs is a good APP and integration will be seamless. 
I always wondered if QR codes would be put to good use, well the answer is bitcoin. 
A fair amount of the spending population have smartphones and if all it takes is a click to scan and pay, it's much easier than counting change and no need to worry about someone stealing your card strip information.
We're always looking for simplicity and/or convenience, I see bitcoin quickly expediting the process of purchases everywhere if adopted and applied correctly.
Perhaps it might just be ahead of its time, who knows.

That's one of my primary concerns as well, if it's simply mined and was created from nothing, we're all speculators irregardless. 
The fear isn't helping, if people just held it wouldn't have been catastrophic of a drop from the China news. Just because it can't be adopted overseas I don't feel it warrants a scare for Americans since our government has yet to issue any regulations or statement.
I was excited when Merryl Lynch report came out to value it at $1300, but I guess that wore off real fast.

I wholeheartedly agree, which is also why it seems a risky investment. The mechanics and process is a bit tedious to explain and hard to absorb at first, which takes time which I'm guessing the average person doesn't care enough to bother unfortunately.

Everyone speculating and self-fulfilling the crash. "Everyone else is selling, I must sell too now"
If people just fucking hold, then we wouldn't see this.
Meanwhile those who can afford it are buying now and re-entering the market to boost it back up.
