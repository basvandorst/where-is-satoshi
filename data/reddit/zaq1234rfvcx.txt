It would be easy to let pharmacies ask for id before filling electronic prescriptions. Also, many pharmacies deliver their drugs to your doorstep. Your home address would be the double-check that it is you.
Did you know we actually use fax machines these days to send prescriptions to a pharmacy? It's that thing that interprets paper on one end and spews it out on the other after passing it through a phone line.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:51:26
Interesting. Why would this be better though? It would allow the pharmacy to control the number of fills instead of the doctor. This could be seen as an advantage or a disadvantage. Normally doctors control how many times their prescriptions can be used.

As I wrote in response to Xenu below, maybe I am not ready to accept the full consequences of this line of reasoning. I see how the current system could be viewed as doctors protecting their prescription monopoly, but I actually do believe it is probably better to regulate access to the prescription drug market in some way or the other. The system in which only doctors can write prescriptions is one way to handle this.
But I would welcome an experiment to see what actually goes wrong if doctors write prescriptions merely as advice and every drug is available over the counter. If nothing major goes wrong it is definitely the better system, because it leaves the choice with the patient.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:07:31
That sounds logical. So you would hash the prescription (including date, patient data, and the actual prescription) and turn it into a private key. Now the doctor adds 1 sathoshi to the address and the prescription can be used once. Add two satoshi and the prescription can be used twice. Interesting!
The private address can be turned into a QR code and be included with the e-mail that holds the prescription text. The pharmacist can verify that the prescription text is correct by hashing it and checking it with the private address (should match). He can verify that the doctor wrote the prescription by checking the blockchain for the transaction by the doctor's address to the prescription address. And he can render the prescription useless by extracting the satoshi from the address.

1. Agreed, the higher the budget, the more logical to use a middle man - this does not preclude that though
2. Agreed, but the model is not pay-per-click. Stats can be generated by routing the link through a URL shortener.
3. see 2.
4. Agreed, but this is a bottom layer - anyone can layer on top.
5. See 4.
6. No, it simply displays one ad indefinitely - the one with the highest transaction - up until someone else pays a higher price. So one-off miner fees.

Saving became effectively impossible in a fiat world. Savers suffer a virtually guaranteed loss of purchasing power. This forces potential savers to become investors. With Bitcoin they can become savers again.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:17:54
You might be right. However, the beauty is that advertisers will not be forced to deal with middlemen. They can choose to put up an ad by simply paying the website owner directly. You could say: "Hey, I like this Reddit post/Wordpress article/website page and it is totally relevant for my product. Let's display my ad with it now in a few clicks and for a low fee." The money would go directly to the website. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:05:26
Good question. I suppose it could work on a centralized system as well. But to use the blockchain seems the easier solution. And it would allow for decentralized permissionless development as well as support the BTC community.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:48:00
You are right. In the current system doctors use their autographs and fancy looking paper to instill trust that the prescription came from a doctor. How could this be improved?
@_date: 2014-08-09 16:06:14
We would not want to take an existing solution and add Bitcoin though. We would want to create something new that could not exist without Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:10:28
Saw that one too last week. It was days after I saw a random stranger with a to-the-moon-guy shirt in SF, shouted Bitcoin and got a nod. What a week I had, huh?
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:03:39
he would have been chased all over the blockchain
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:17:15
Or the doctor could simply create a presciption as he would normally do. He can e-mail the prescription as a text-document to his patient after creating a bitcoin address from it and adding a satoshi to it. The patient would be able to forward the text-document to the pharmacy of his choice. The pharmacy could simply read the prescription and fill it. However, to preclude double-spending, it would have to hash the text-file and check in the blockchain if it exists and if a trusted doctor's address added a satoshi to it. Next, the prescription address can be rendered useless by the pharmacy by adding another satoshi to the address.
This way, the patient is simply carrying around a document containing his prescription. No private keys necessary.

Agreed. But the proposed solution can still facilitate a middleman. It's just optional, that's all. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:33:58
Government. Hmmm. Couldn't doctors simply hang onto the original private key and revoke the prescription after a prespecified time period if it had not been filled by then?

Thanks for your thoughts! Online advertising has come a long way, so competition is stiff. The solution I propose is not as good but it is simpler. But many of the sophisticated functions you describe could probably be open-sourced and stripped of middlemen, wouldn't you agree? How would you do it?

It allows the website owner to automatically display ads on his webpage without paying fees to a middle man.
It allows advertisers to select appropriate webpages to display their ads without paying fees to a middle man.
It will be extremely easy. All you have to do as advertiser is create a jpg ad and a landing page. You can have your ad display instantaneously at any webpage that allows for this type of advertisement by making a transaction to a bitcoin address using any available wallet by just adding the URLs as a comment.

OK thanks, you obviously have a lot of experience with this, so it's hard for me to argue with that. Normally I would say my conviction is that trying to lose the middle man will initially result in an inferior but cheaper product and ultimately in a superior and cheaper product. I would point to many other examples of this phenomenon. But in this case I am not sure, because the Internet already radically changed advertising.

This is important though. Bitcoin should remain exchangable for fiat to support the Switch

We should be humble. Complexity adds to the fun of models but not to their predictive capacity. You actually made an excellent point in your video: the best model is today's price. I fully agree. It is fun to use other models to try and improve on it. But let's call it what it is. Fun.

I would agree with this remark with respect to grocery stores. Consumers choose those on the basis of convenience. You are not going to visit 5 different stores or go out of your way to shop at the cheapest if there is another slightly more expensive store around the corner. But on the internet, things are different. If I shop for a product online, I go to a website to compare all prices. I choose the merchant with the lowest price. The merchant that can show me a 4% discount will almost invariably win my business. Online, price competition is killing.

That could definitely work and it would be very simple actually. But it removes the patient from the equation. I would like the patient to be able to choose which pharmacy he goes to. But if you sacrifice that option, your solution is the easiest.

Compare gold to 10 yr bonds. Gold is more volatile but bonds are riskier. The price of gold cannot go to zero because there is no counterparty risk. Bonds can go to zero because the issuer can go into default. So it all depends on your frame of reference and your timeframe. In this case, would you say high volatility = high risk?
@_date: 2014-09-02 13:54:56
It sold out in an hour, apparently risk appetite and unreasonable optimism  remain at high levels in the Bitcoin world.

It is impossible to know where interest rates are headed in the short term, I grant you that. However, at some point they will rise again. Many think that this will trigger a crisis of epic proportions because it will violently deflate the ever-increasing debt bubble. What are your thoughts on this? What will happen to Bitcoin adoption in such a scenario? Will people flock to it, mistrusting fiat? Or will they run from it in need of fiat liquidity?
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:08:30

I sent them this:
Dear Keepod developers,
I was struck by your very profound plan to improve ditital literacy in the third world. Some thoughts came to mind that I would like to share with you.
1. Software vs USB stick
The software will probably spread faster than the sticks. As soon as it can be downloaded illegally through torrent sites, assume that this will become the preferential route of distribution. You can either let this interfere with your business model or you can make your business model immune to it by making the downloads free of charge and find another way to make the money to support it (donations?)
2. Your product is a match made in heaven with Bitcoin wallets. As you may know, Bitcoin is the easiest, most rapidly growing way to serve the unbanked. I could send anyone in the world money, practically without fees and totally immune from middleman corruption, if only this person had a Bitcoin wallet. I implore you to seriously consider this solution. Bitcoin is backed by hundreds of thousands of bright, idealistic individuals who dream of innovating the concept of money itself. It is happening today. Think M-pesa, only better. As you may know, the way currencies are created, managed and distributed by banks, governments and other middlemen in the third world (and elsewhere for that matter) has not always been favourable to the poor. Bitcoin puts money back in the hands of the people. Imagine this: Kwame's brother made it to Europe and sends back money to Kwame in Africa through Western Union on a regular basis and pays ludicrous fees for it. To collect the money, Kwame has to pass several gentleman in front of the Western Union office who are more than willing to take a cut (protection money). Now imagine this: Kwame's brother sends money to Kwame instantly, practically without fees (a few cents if that) and no-one can get on Kwame's case about it. If you like this scenario better too, check out Bitcoin wallet for Android by Andreas Schildbach or the Blockchain.info wallet. You can distribute them with the rest of the software for free.

I think it might be easier because the blockchain security is more or less guaranteed by the enormous vested interest in its integrity. But this is speculation from my side. I'm a doctor, not an engineer.
It should not be an anonymous prescription: the name, address and DOB of the patient should be included in the hash. Anonymizing it helps no-one.
It is my understanding that it is not an open ledger since hashing is a one-way thing. Or isn't it? I would assume no-one would be able to reverse engineer the prescription from the hash, right?
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:25:56
It would need to be as simple as possible.

1. Before, sending money to other countries would cost you a lot of money. With Bitcoin you can now send money instantly to anyone in the world, practically for free. Bitcoin is to money what e-mail is to mail.
2. Before, you could be certain that your savings would diminish in value because banks would always be printing more money. With Bitcoin, you can now keep your savings in a currency that is safe from the printing press; your money is very likely to increase in value over time. Bitcoin is like gold, only much easier to do transactions with. 
3. Before, if banks became insolvent, you would never know if you would be able to get to your money and spend it as you please. With Bitcoin, you now control your own money and banks become unnecessary. Bitcoin is competition for banks, just like the Internet was competition for libraries.

The website owner could overpay to his own address and thus remove the ad, thereby not providing the service. The advertiser would have to trust the website owner not to do that. It is the same when you put up an ad against someone's shop window and pay him for it: you'll have to trust him not to remove it.
The terms are not regulated. The ad will be shown as long as there are no higher payments to the address. There is no click limit.

You forget about risk. In a fiat world investing is smart because there is no alternative. The risk of investing is artificially diminished by the diminishing purchasing power of fiat. In a bitcoin world, investing will become riskier again. Preference will therefore shift toward saving. Smart people recognize this shift and will save more and invest less.
