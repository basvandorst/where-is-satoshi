His argument is dumb. Yes, BTC at $1M will put the satoshi on parity with the penny. But WHY would it be worth that much? He makes an argument about liquidity for businesses, but what does BTC have to offer a business that USD can't do? Businesses can do wire transfers of millions of dollars for free and instantly. 
I think BTC is great for consumers as a form of digital cash, but there's no benefit to using it for B2B transactions over traditional currencies.

"Defense-grade" means nothing and most modern phones have hardware-backed secure storage that can be used to store private keys.

You're right, it's not. But a regulated Money Service Business needs to take steps to ensure their service isn't used for illegal activities. They are legally required to do this of they'll lose their license.
Companies like Venmo and Paypal have a compliance department that looks for potentially illegal activity and will flag you for it. Venmo's system looks for keywords, similar to how Google Pay or Wallet or whatever it was called did it. This is stupid, but it helps them stay in compliance. 
Keep in mind that these companies aren't required to do business with you. If anything you do is even remotely suspicious, they are well within their rights to ask you to explain yourself (like they're doing for OP) or just terminate your account. It's easier and safer for them to do that than to let potentially illegal activity happen through their system.

In this context, it's more important that he's the CEO of Twitter because Twitter is the platform that Tippin uses to send tips. It has nothing at all to do with Square, so why would they mention that Dorsey is also the CEO of Square?

Can you elaborate on what exactly you mean by "price jump in recent weeks"?
It's down for the year and is at the same level it was a month ago. There was a small dip towards the end of January but now it's back where it started.

You can't buy things over amateur radio bands. It's not legal to use those frequencies for business.
There are some exceptions, like you can tell someone that you're selling a piece of radio equipment, but you can't have a business selling radio equipment over the ham bands.
