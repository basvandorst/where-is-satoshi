No one will sell you BTC for PayPal or credit card because you can charge them back any time without an explanation.
These exchange ask for ID because of fraud. They want to make sure that you are using a legitimate account (i.e. not stolen), as if stolen funds go into their account, they will have some explaining to do to the banks, once the funds are traced.

Honestly, I have done a significant amount of my trades on OKCoin, since mid 2013. They have an intuitive interface, zero fees, and high (or now 'high') liquidity. 
But just a few days back I withdrew most of my coins and fled for the safety of some of the other more reputable exchanges. 
OKCoin, if you can prove your worth and be more transparent with your activities, please do so, I'm sure there's many traders waiting to come back.

I predicted back in April 2014  that the we may follow the same trend as back in 2013. And here we are today. So far the trend has held, and we may be on track.
In the next couple months, I would say there would be a slight dip in price, followed by an exponential surge over previous highs in about October.
People may say, it's different this time because of this and that, therefore trends are not relevant.
Charts don't give us the full picture, but they can tell us a lot about market behaviour + the market's perception of the fundamentals, while history shows that markets can operate in trends and cycles. We understand the developments taking place all over the world - potential source code refinement, VC capital, the strongest of the start-ups emerging to bring bitcoin to the masses, merchant adoption, governmental acceptance, Bitcoin 2.0, etc.
But then again, maybe trends won't persist. Just presenting some facts, to form a speculation.
I will post again in October 2014. Good luck.

If you want to not lose in trading bitcoin, just buy a bit when you think it is hitting a bottom, only sell when it rises to a point you believe it will fall again, and then only buy again when you think it may rise again. If you stick to that rule, you will never lose, in terms of btc anyway.
@_date: 2014-08-26 07:07:00
1. Sell some at price X
2. Wait for price to drop below X
3. Buy back and profit
If price never drops below X, then you'll never buy back.

Here's a few facts about UFUN's UToken from [here](
















I have watched a couple of their presentations:
[Utoken Investment Of A Lifetime (DO NOT DELAY)](
[UFun UToken Presentation Video English](
 
and have solidly concluded that this is a very smart scam, targeting people who do not understand money and 'digital currency'. In both presentations, they compare UTokens to Bitcoin, saying that Bitcoin was less than $0.01 and now is $250+ so if you missed the boat with Bitcoin, UTokens are the next big thing and is already doing better than Bitcoin for the following reasons:
* UToken has a big company presence behind them, whereas Bitcoin is not owned by anyone
* UFUN has 22 offices located all over the world, whereas Bitcoin does not
* UToken value appreciated by more than 600% in its first year, whereas Bitcoin did not
* UFUN plan to open some really big online shopping destinations that are dedicated to spending UTokens, whereas there is no such comparison for Bitcoin
I think it's disgusting that they are comparing UTokens to Bitcoin.
Here's a few more facts about UToken:
* UTokens are kept on a centralised database. All transactors must transact through the UFUN portal.
* UTokens are NOT a cryptocurrency. It is a digital currency. It is NOT innovative or revolutionary. It is simply a database.
* UTokens are not limited in supply. No one knows how many there are in circulation. When someone 'invests', they are simply given UTokens generated from a database entry.
* You can't trade UTokens outside of the UFUN portal.
* The company claims that the value CANNOT go down, but only up. Why is this? Very simply, because "demand is outstripping supply" and plus, the company sets the price, therefore UTokens are protected from market crashes (what logic...).
* You can invest in an amount of UTokens today, and spend them at the stores or wait for appreciation. If you refer other investors, you can receive a percentage of their investment, and also a percentage on their referrals too.
To get an idea of what UTokens are, please watch the youtube videos listed above. Please make sure you watch the 'presentation video' at the end of the first link, and PLEASE let me know if you think a multi-million $ company would produce such a video. Also check out one of their official sites:  Any default open source CMS template can look better than this.
tl;dr Do your own research and avoid UToken scam.
edit: their official website I believe is  not the one mentioned previously

Can confirm. Am Chinese.
The communist party knows what's up, be assured. But they are also very wary of people's opinions of them. They'd rather settle an issue underhandedly rather than openly and show people what they really think on a particular point or view. 
Jihan possibly would've been invited to "drink tea" with the high level party officials one afternoon, and the rest is history.

For 2) think about it this way: if it divides into smaller decimals, all holders of coin would receive more coin proportionally. It's like a stock split. It doesn't increase the value, because each "share" is of lesser value.

If it is as you said, a proposal accepted by many, then Joseph was the legal father of Jesus - an important record for the Jews. The point is that both legal and biological lines point back to David.
So does Matthew seemingly leaving out a few generations make the passage erroneous or difficult to believe? The only missing piece from what you've said is the reason why (numerology or for purposes otherwise) Matthew has chosen to shorten his genealogy from David to Jesus, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:42:26
Show me what's conflicting between Matt 1 and Luke 3 and I'll explain it to you.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:10:50
The reason could be for 7s and 14s for appeal to his immediate audience. There could be other reasons why some people were left out, that we may not be aware of. That doesn't necessarily mean the accounts are conflicting, nor inaccurate. You wouldn't expect someone going through thousands of years of history to list every single person of a particular category, you'd expect them to list the significant ones. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:21:53

@_date: 2017-11-03 12:49:21
Yes there's conflicts such as these. Jesus healing one blind man (Mark 10:46 + Luke 18:35) and Jesus healing two blind men (Matt 20:30). This is a conflict but not a contradiction. It is possible to reconcile the two because both can be true at the same time.

Current era historians still examine history that is more than 20 years in the past. Surely that doesn't make their examination of history invalid. You're talking about Islam?...
The view of someone not trusting past-era history is perfectly valid, and acceptable. But if you can't trust one of the best attested ancient historical pieces of evidence we have, then I don't know which other ancient history you can trust. 
I don't believe everything we have is accurate historically. But I believe the Bible is preserved well enough for its original meaning to still be conveyed today from manuscriptural evidence dating back to early church times.

Samsung phones will come with default app that allows user to send money instantly to anyone on their contact list. If there's no 'money' loaded in the app, it will deduct from your credit card and create an instant transaction. When 'money' is received instantaneously by recipient, he won't need to convert to fiat because he won't know it's not fiat. Operator somehow hedges movement in price. The app backs up your money to the cloud so losing phone won't equal losing money. User will be able to spend this money at any POS terminal (I'm aware of a company working with Mastercard to create something similar). Samsung will take mobile banking to the future. Samsung will not have the stupidity to use the S-Coin blockchain.

Chinese gov bans many types of shorts in the stock market. They also have funny rulings on trade suspension after a certain % drop for the day, believe it's 7% stops for an hour, and 10% end of trading for the day.

"不能且不应作为货币在市场上流通使用" - seems to translate to: "Cannot and should not be used as currency in the market for transactional purposes."
But goes on to say "但是，比特币交易作为一种互联网上的商品买卖行为，普通民众在自担风险的前提下拥有参与的自由。" which means Bitcoin is a special type of online good that can be bought and sold by ordinary citizens who will take their own risk in doing so.

Friend and myself have used them several times and very smooth. Plus they only charge 2% on buys at very fair weighted spot price.

Yep I'd think it's the large volume, even last week they were fine - cash deposit within a couple hours and bitcoins came in almost instantly after buy order.
