Litecoin is basically a better bitcoin

Or Realestate because it's scarce in most major world cities.

Yep convenience.  And for some people who are upper middle class and above, the big banks give them a lot of perks.  For example, if you have over 50k invested with BoA they give you a special credit card that earns rewards much faster than their normal card.  Basically allows the rich to get richer.

Honestly, if you’re a US citizen who gets rich off crypto, you should just fucking move to another country like Singapore with no capital gain taxes.

Bitcoiners are dreamers who barely understand the current economic forces at play.  Most bitcoiners are nerds and techies who got fucking lucky.  If you think it's what governments and central banks want us to believe then you have absolutely 0 knowledge about monetary policy and central banking policy and how it affects the economy.  Central banks are not trying to fuck you.  They are there to keep with economy growing at a steady pace and keep inflation from being too high or to stop deflation.  Small amounts of yearly inflation are healthy.  As an economics major from a top business school, I suggest you google search monetary policy and learn up.  Also governments CAN stop bitcoin usage if they so choose.  How the fuck do most people buy bitcoin in the US anyway?  You have to take money from your US bank account and transfer it to a company that will trade it for bitcoin.  US government could tell banks to stock all transfers and then that kills the market for 99% of people.  Sure, people will find illegal ways to buy bitcoin, but it will never reach mass adoption again.  Or the US government makes it an illegal form of tender telling merchants that they cannot accept bitcoin as payment.  This also KILLS fucking bitcoin usage in the US.  Now, they could allow bitcoin to be used as a form of value storage or a form of transferring money overseas.  But I don't know if the US government will fully allow the currency to replace the US dollar and give up all control of the economy.  It's honestly more scary to have a decentralized system where if things get fucked up, there is nothing anyone can do to try and fix it.  
To add:  I think the technology that bitcoin and other cryptos are built on is genius and will have many future uses.  Hell, governments will probably create their own centralized cryptocurrencies using modified versions of the tech.  But I don't think we are going to have a decentralized world wide currency anytime soon.  Government won't allow it, and it honestly might not be a good idea since monetary policy has historically been GOOD for most developed nations.

Ok yes they benefit from asset appreciation.  But now that bitcoin is an all-time high, no one knows how much further it can go.  And currently it's not a good store of value due to the high volatility.  I would only invest in Bitcoin now if you're ok losing a substantial amount of your investment.  Far too risky for the average person to use or invest in.

GFAX sucks ass.  bittrex is where it’s at
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:25:03
Honestly if it starts crashing don't be a dumb ass.  Sell high and then buy back it at the lower price.  So far it looks like it's going down it price and I have no doubt it's going to continue going down to around 9-10k
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:05:54
They are scared about ICOs too since they don’t get any fees or control ICOs.  It’s a new an innovative way for companies to raise capital at a cheaper price without involving wall street.

You should learn about moletary policy and the feds goal.  Their number one goal is to keep inflation between 1-3%.  You also should learn about the financial crisis and the true causes because it was not caused by the federal reserve.  And please tell me how a decentralized global currency is going to help during a recentionary buesiness period?  Or help stop hyperinflation if the economy heats up too much?  The main reason in 2006 the fed wanted to increase the interest rate was to help cool the economy down.  To make it so banks slowed down lending.  And to ensure that inflation stayed between 1-3%.  Yes we have a lot of currency in circulation currently, but most of that currency is held in banks.  And guess what?  Those banks have not been lending a large portion of that money.  The recovery cycle of 2008 would have seen the entire collapse of the world financial system and we would lost decades of progression.  I don’t think people fully understand how fucking close the world financial system was to not existing anymore and what the ramifications of this are.  Tens of millions of people would have gone without food, shelter, proper medical care all because the monetary system collapsed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:59:11
How will they organize a crash though?  The only way they could would be to buy a bunch of coins at the current price and then just flood the market with them.  But that’s very costly to do at the current going price

You can only sell products that people want to buy and those 2 billion people don't have products that people want to buy.  Maybe some crafts that their village makes out of sticks and stones for .000000001 BTC but those 2 billion are mostly uneducated and are not fully contributing to the advancement of society.  It's not their fault, but bitcoin isn't going to magically make people wealthy or have the means to receive gainful education and better their economic situation.  You truly are delusional.

See I don’t think central banks are going to allow it to replace all currencies.  There are still many benefits to having a central banking system and allowing them to control the money supply.  There could be profound issues with a decentralized global currency.  Yes central banks can fuck up a currency and thus a country’s economy but they can also play a role in helping the economy when policy is enacted correctly.  It’s not an exact science since economies are so complex with so many variables.  I’m telling you right now that major world governments are not going to allow bitcoin to replace their monetary system.  China has already put their stance in and other major governments will follow.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:36
I think it's going to stay between 9-10k for a couple weeks after this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:26:32
But you still need banks because they loan fucking money.  They will just buy a bunch of bitcoin and loan that shit out.  Plus loans are god for the economy.  And yes banks will still be relevant because some group has to allocate capital to the best investments and that’s what banks do. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:53
You bring some great points and I do agree that most major world governments are not going to replace their currency with a decentralized monetary system.  Leading economists would also tell us that a decentralized system is a terrible idea because central banks assist the economy through monetary policy.  And most of the time, they do an ok job of helping the economy.  If it wasn’t for quantitative easing, the World financial system would have fucking collapsed.  After 2008 banks simply stopped loaning money because they had lost so much on people defaulting.  The 2008 financial crisis was the faults of banks, rating agencies, and greedy financial illiterate people who though they could afford a house WAY outside of their earnings level or future earnings level.  The centralized currency system in the US didn’t cause the financial crisis.  The federal reserve didn’t cause it.  The federal reserve helped save the fucking system.  If the world only transacted in bitcoin or another decentralized system, how the fuck could governments save the financial system?  The answer is there would be NOTHING they could do to help and the financial system would collapse.  Block chain is an amazing technology but you’re not going to see a single global currency ever.

Honestly, if the average Joe is going to put money in bitcoin, it needs to benefit them somehow.  Currently, bitcoin doesn't benefit the average Joe and it's very volatile.  Once Bitcoin can sustain years of moderate growth in value or become less volatile, then it will be a good store of wealth.  I'd say we are ways away from that day and I honestly think BTC is going to fall back to the 8-10k range within the next week.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:05:12
And I think you just answered the question of why it will never fully replace the USD.  It’s too risky for the US to not be in change of their own monetary supply.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:52:44
Yet.  You’re buying into it’s future promises.

Your unintelligent responses about the government and central banks failing sums up your understanding of what their purposes even is.  Please tell me how they have systematically failed?  Sure, they have made mistakes, but recessions are not really caused by the government or the central banks.  Recessions are created by other complex economic forces.  Do you think that bitcoin will eradicate recessionary business cycles?   Because if bitcoin is the only currency and we go into a recession, the world will literally end because there will be no way to fix the economy.

You’re never going to completely get rid of banks though.  Their role in the modern day society is to allocate capital to the best projects.  All that’s going to happen is banks with convert their regional government currencies to crypto and start loaning crypto.  Yes it’s a fundamental shift but you’re not eradicating banks.

It can deffinitly be beaten by governments.  It will never gain mass adoption is governments ban businesses from accepting or using crypto.

It was hard not to make insane returns over the past 2 years in crypto though.  For those who got in early - mid 2017 still made insane gains.  I wish I knew about crypto before the general public.
