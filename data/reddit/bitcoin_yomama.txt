I disagree with this philosophy.  If I thought my Bitcoin trading or long term investments were going to be a loss I wouldn't invest here at all.  My investment philosophy is stick my neck on the line.
Less risk pays nothing relevant to anybody with under $100,000.
With $20,000 you go balls to the wall.  It was Marijuana stocks about a year ago now it's Bitcoin and it's been Bitcoin since $1350.
The goal isn't to buy a few steak dinners and date nights with $20,000, the goal is turning it into 1/4 mil or there's no reason to be here.

As an owner of 2 new cars (one forced on me by a close relative who forged my signature, so I had to either confiscate and keep the sports car making it mine or have her arrested for fraud to nullify the contract) I will state that car payments are an absolutely horrid thing around your neck.  2 vehicle payments $1,000 a month out my arse that I would travel or invest with...
If you get something just lease.  Lease a Honda Fit for cheap then get rid of it in 3 years.  Doesn't matter if you get a luxury car or nicer sports car... people don't really care and it won't help you get a woman, your personality will.  Cars are so over rated.
The second you drive your new shiny car off the lot you just lost $5,000 to $10,000 immediately.

@_date: 2017-05-23 03:24:51
What's your time horizon?  This cycle hasn't topped yet I think Bitcoin hits $2500 to $3000 before a pullback, then maybe just to $2200 region...
I think the guy who took out a $321,000 loan and bought at $1700 got a great price.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:03:30

LOL Great Pic.
If this is your first time investing and you didn't time it right don't feel bad... happens to us all at one time.  Bitcoin is in a bull market.  This means buy the valleys and sell the peaks.  
Enjoy everybody!
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:40:12
I don't think so this time.  Any pullback likely won't go lower than 188 on the GBTC.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:01:40
This is why I just own a few coins with Coin Base and the majority with GBTC stock... Buy and sell is only $6.95 for as much money as I want.  Using the GBTC as a trading vehicle would be a more affordable way to trade and lock in profits without exorbitant fees.  However, there is a liquidity issue and buys and sells aren't as fast as other stocks... that said I love Bitcoin as the Wall St. crowd can't manipulate it...  It trades 24/7 and is huge in Asia.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:54:20
Yes, I was hoping GBTC would dip to 160 but that doesn't look likely, even if it happens I'd think the uptrend would resume quickly.
I went all in today, I don't care.  If it sells off it sells off.  I'll take my profits when the GBTC is over 1000.
Yes I don't care if it's currently selling at a premium.  Makes no difference.  Bull market here.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:59:40
My fellow Bitconiacs, this is the strategy:
1. Hold long some Bitcoins in a Wallet, you don't touch these
2. Trade IN and OUT of GBTC, buying low, selling high.
3. Take a percentage of your GBTC profits and buy actual Bitcoins, adding to your Wallet.
This strategy with the Bitcoin Bull Market will give you income via the GBTC and add Bitcoins to your Wallet which we are hoping to scale out of at 100,000, 200,000 500,000 1M 5M

I think Bitcoin here follows the WEED.TO stock almost exactly from it's parabolic height in mid-November last year.  Probably runs again in January after basing.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:07:14
GBTC on StockCharts.com shows a continued move up...  I think BitCoin can easily go to $3,000 here or $4,000 or $5,000.
Nothing technically says this will pull back.  It's full green lights technically.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:53:47
Nice, I think GBTC 200 is the lowest it will correct depending on if it goes parabolic next week up to GBTC 325+...  Bitcoin that's $1800 range for a low.  Looks like "All the way up!"
I think downside risk is minimum.

You can just buy the GBTC for $7 per buy and sell... beats wallets like Coinbase that charge an enormous buy and sell fee and limit you to nonsensical $7500 per week buy/sell of Bitcoin and then restrict selling to $15,000.  WTF?  For small change people I guess.  Those limits are way too small for swing trading.

I would assume it won't go lower than 1500 to 1450 and may take several months, but I don't know I'll just watch for the next buying opportunity.  This ran from $1350 to $2800 ish and if you look at the GBTC at stockcharts.com the RSI going to 90 was a clear top.  Wednesday morning the RSI was at 92 and the extreme over bought condition screamed "SELL" technically.  This run is done for now.  More profits to come next round.
Good luck to ya!

Gotcha.  Smart man...  I'm in the GBTC at a very nice entry and the RSI is almost 90 which tells me there may be a pause soon...  however...  my traditional stock trading methods may not apply to Bitcoin as it's a 24/7 international trade and isn't being manipulated by any banks, so it's hard for me to gauge moves.  All I can do is hold my position.  10,000 hits and the GBTC will likely be 3000 to 5000.

Thanks for sharing your story and I'm glad you got your money!!!  I've always been cautious with my money and will be even more so now.  I like to transfer my money in blocks anyways to avoid this type of scenario...
So I'm sure as a learning lesson you'll - in the future - make a smaller initial transfer to test things, then go from there in blocks.
But you're probably like me and do fast money trades, so I totally understand why you did it.
Good luck man!  With 1/3rd that cash you could start a nice GPU mining operation with an ROI around 10 months even at these shit prices.

Actually the Nordic model of Socialism which is a hybrid of Capitalism and Socialism (better parts of both) works.  Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden... These countries have a great social safety net and work towards maximum workforce participation.  These nations are actually real Democracies, although I question if Germany could be in that list of a true Democracy because they really are a duopoly like the U.S.
Venezuela is extreme Socialism and Oligarchy.
