I agree, its always 2 steps forwards, and 1 step back for government.  Claiming the 1 step back is a success, is exactly the trap they want you to fall into.  That's how the march towards tyranny goes.

You still have access.  When you send Bitcoins from one address, it sends the entire contents.  If you had 1 btc in an address and send 0.1 btc, then it would send the 0.1 btc to the address you desired, but then it automatically sends the 0.9 btc back to a different address called a change adress that is also under your control in that wallet.

The reason why they think it is going to go up, is because of the incredible technology and utility as a payment system and as a sound money system that Bitcoin offers.  Usually when the vast majority of anything think the price of something will go up, amazingly the price does go up, its called the market.

This is all because of the unconstitutional drug war.  Prohibition of alcohol needed the 18th amendment to the constitution, which was later repealed at the end of prohibition.  No such amendment exists for prohibition of drugs, proving the drug war is unconstitutional.  If no drug war, then no need to worry about money laundering anymore.  Enough with the victimless crimes, we don't want to pay Law Enforcement salaries to violate the constitution and lock non-violent people in cages anymore.

Yes well its always good to hold your private keys as much as possible.  When trusting a 3rd party to hold them for you it just comes with risks.  About a year ago the biggest bitcoin exchange MtGox failed and lost everyones bitcoins.  People who trusted them lost everything.  I still use 3rd parties from time to time, but only for small amounts of coins.
I believe you can send to others e-mail if they have a coinbase account, or even if they don't have a coinbase account yet.  I think it sends them an e-mail prompting them to set up account and collect the payment.  
Also if you really want security of your wallets, check out [cold storage](  Also you can get hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your coins safe on an offline device while allowing you to spend easily.  Its very newbie friendly and easy to use, and also very secure.  Also you can print paper wallets with sites like [bitaddress]( or [bitcoinpaperwallet.com](

The real thing to look at is on the left.  Its measured in the TRILLIONS of dollars.  Bitcoin is only 4.4 billion right now.  Those who compare Bitcoin to the dot com bubble really aren't thinking in perspective.

Your coins aren't really solutions to math equations per se.  Yes in a way when the coins are minted by miners, they are solving math problems, which also simultaneously verify transactions and secure the network.
Its better to think of Bitcoin as a public ledger instead.  All you are doing is moving the coins around on that ledger.  The solving math problem part comes into play when the miners work to put the transactions into a block and lock it into the ledger.
Smarter mathematicians can't do anything to find an advantage to mine all the coins.  The reason is because the difficulty of these math problems adjust as the network grows.  Actually smart people did find ways to mine Bitcoins quicker already, using devices called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), which are really fast computers to mine Bitcoins.  But Bitcoin has a protection against this.  As more processing power comes on the network, the difficulty always adjusts.  The difficulty is adjusted so that the average time between blocks remains 10 minutes, no matter how many ASICs or what have you are on the network.

Don't worry about the legality.  Sure its probably technically illegal, but [so is everything](  If they comb the books, they can always find something you are doing illegal.  The average person commits multiple felonies per day and doesn't even know it.  In my opinion the chances of getting in trouble for this are really miniscule.  Many places are doing it already.  As long as your boss is ok with it, I say go for it.  I would actually like to know the name and location of the place so I can buy pizza with Bitcoin.
You can also register the business with some bitcoin directories, like [airbitz](  Alternatively you could use a service like BitPay or Coinbase merchant services to accept the Bitcoin for you.  Then you certainly wouldn't have any legal risk.

You can't be serious.  Regulations prevent MtGoxings??? LOL  You must have been sleeping during the too-big-to-fail banker bailouts in 2008, that left the too-big-to-fail banks even bigger than ever before. Or maybe you missed the story about how the banks launder trillions in drug money for murderous cartels and nobody gets in trouble.  Regulations don't stop Goxing events because regulators become captured resulting in much higher levels of corruption.  Look up the term "regulatory capture" then get back to us.

Then you try to pay with a 100 dollar bill at the store, and people look at you like you are some type of criminal.

I don't use PayPal too much, but you could probably try localbitcoins.com to find someone to trade with on there.  Sometimes people have trouble trusting PayPal for Bitcoin, because PayPal can be reversible, and Bitcoin is non-reversible so it opens up the chance to get scammed.  For this reason you may pay a premium for your Bitcoins when using PayPal.
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:37:09
so for a sidechain to be merge mined, does that mean the sidechain will have inflation, and when you change your coins back into bitcoin you will get less bitcoin?

[Pete Schiff commented on this recently](
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:22:58
Welcome.  Its good to see new people learning about Bitcoin.  My suggestion is download your own wallet like [electrum](  Or find a mobile wallet for smartphones [here]( like bread wallet or mycelium.  Bitcoin Core is the original wallet, but I suggest stay away from it unless you want to download the full blockchain, which can take several days.  Electrum and mobile wallets don't require that.  Electrum for example is an HD wallet, and it will give you a 12 word seed when you create it.  This seed serves as the backup for all of your coins because it can be used to create all of your private keys for that wallet.
Having your own wallet like Electrum is much different than a third party service like changetip or Coinbase.  They both offer good service, but they are handling all of the private keys for you.  To have more control and to understand the true essence of Bitcoin you should have a wallet where you control your own private keys.  
Since you are still trying to learn how the private keys in Bitcoin work, I highly suggest [this video]( that explains the math behind the private keys in Bitcoin.  
Coinbase and changetip are different services so you can't consolidate them, but you can move your coins off into your own wallet.  The Coinbase send to e-mail option sounds cool but I never used it.  Only Coinbase will know your e-mail however, so only your coinbase account will be linked to it as far as I know.  The Bitcoin network won't know your e-mail at all.
When sending Bitcoin from other wallets you use Bitcoin public addresses, which look something like this  	1E3wrCQTghKATNRBdRtLB92e664VgjR4Bs.  They always start with a 1, except for multi-signature/P2SH addresses that begin with a 3.
Each one is unique.  You receive Bitcoin by giving others one of your addresses.  You can use a different one each time for better privacy and security.  You send Bitcoins to others by having them tell you their address.  Also you can use a service called [one name]( to register your name or id publicly for others to find your address.  It is implemented only in a small number of wallets, but it hasn't seemed to gain much steam yet.

Doesn't sound very safe.  Once you put your private key onto a device connected to internet its no longer cold storage.  Also watch out for change addresses when sweeping paper wallets.  Its not usually recommended to spend partial balances from paper wallets as people get confused a lot by the change addresses.
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:50:50

I bet the rumors are true.  I think its taking longer because they probably have to build their own implemenation of it.  Also it took a while for Bitcoin to get more mainstream acceptance.  Coinbase also doesn't allow gambling or poker transactions.  I am not sure about BitPay either, but probably PokerStars doesn't want to use one of these types of services anyways because of regulatory and other risks. 
I remember back in the day PokerStars took a long time to build their own E-check implementation, and once it worked it was super fast and the best method for withdrawing and depositing.   They could be doing similar with Bitcoin.

The way that MyTrezor.com works, it may not show the change address inside the wallet.  Probably this should be improved by the Trezor team.  But don't worry you still control the coins, because you still have your seed.  But soon Electrum 2.0 will be out with full Trezor support.  Using Electrum with Trezor will more explicitly show all of your change address.  It also allows you to send from, or freeze addresses to have more control over your coins.

Volatility of Bitcoin price decreases over time.  This is a brand new currency launched out of nothing turned into a Billion dollar market cap, which is still tiny.  Once the market cap grows more, the volatility will decrease and it will be more stable.  Fiat currencies aren't always stable either, as seen recently in Russia.
