I think the Pirate Party serves the price by creating getopinionated "An online vote system supporting liquid democracy and document collaboration."  With this tool, in combination with a foundation, stichting or (Belgian) vzw you can create an full democratic operating organization.
For example a vzw can get following structure:
A core team of three or more people in the board, they do the field work
A squad of volunteers
And the crowd who participate via the voring system
So no real members.

You can't be sure if there aren't any confirms. In theory it's safe after 6 but you can be sure after one.

"BIPS, I think, charges customer a higher bitcoin exchange fee and in effect charges customers the fee for transactions." interesting that's what I wanted to know

Coinbase is USD only (not for non-Am's) Bitpay and BIPSboth have a lot of others.

I see it as a second hand. You use bitcoin to pay and litecoin to own.

Everybody can view the network. Bitpay (and all the others) just trust the customer that he realy pays.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are (still) seen as a speculative thing. That's way there are so many stupid altcoins that inprove nothing. I think that only BTC and LTC are usefull. W need altcoins for the testing. If the test is positive you can put the new feature into these.

I don't own any LTC myself but I believe in a second coin next to bitcoin. What do you propose? Dogecoin?

Bank infrastructure had been hacked last year (here in Belgium)...

Everything can be hacked (exept protocols) so why not the servers of bitpay, my friend?
