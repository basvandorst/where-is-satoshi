You’re not asking for permission, you’re letting them know the transaction is legitimate, as they evaluate every transaction to ensure it’s not fraud. 
They’re just trying to keep your/their money safe. I gotta say I appreciate how my bank has measures in place to prevent fraudulent transactions.

On a serious note, I agree that banks are purposely making it hard to interact with crypto. However, I have had some good experiences with my bank’s ability to detect fraud and not bother me with false positives, so overall I appreciate their efforts.

They do. They run *every* transaction through some fancy algorithm (often using AI/ML) that assesses the probably of it being fraudulent. If the transaction is deemed too risky it won’t be processed unless you call the bank to verify that it’s legitimate.

There definitely could be. Not like the bank would tell you how they make these decisions

Reversing a transaction is fraud prevention the same way wiping the floor is spill prevention

Didn’t mean to be pedantic.   
The reason I mentioned Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning is that these types of algorithms don’t necessarily have a simple blacklist, they’re more advanced than that. 
They’ve been trained to tell fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones through millions of repeated trials with a known answer key. Once they consistently score high enough on the trials they are very likely to correctly identify fraudulent transactions without any human hardcoding in a blacklist.
