i cannot believe someone would be this intentionally obtuse. have a good day at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:39:38
and i gave a serious response. worry about your own pool.
however, to be fair, im tired of rando issues with antpool so ill be giving slushpool a go for a week.

Ps - im running 4 full nodes now. im pretty sure im doing a bit more for the community than you are, smart guy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:26:06

it also only infected a limited number of s9 miners. it's been patched out in the current firmware.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:47:42

@_date: 2018-05-06 14:52:17
hot damn you are an idiot

blindly assuming that windows cannot be secured enough to trade crypto on without providing an alternative? how's that for starters...
the fact is every platform has its issues with security. android is far worse than windows when it comes to wallet security and how easily android can be compromised vs windows.
that's another topic though.

look at his reply. he is.
sandboxing only affects malicious apps that are looking to make system changes, NOT ones that steal data.

damn near every app on the android store requires ridiculous permissions (accessing contact list, etc) by default because thats the default setting in popular app-building programs.
so sorry, im right and youre wrong in this case.

interesting but a massive fire hazard in the bathroom he had it set up in, not to mention the electrical hazard from putting ASICS 1) in a humid environment and 2) putting ASICs under a sink that could leak.
lets not glorify stupid ideas. while this one has potential, the way it was set up is so out of code, as well as being a fire AND electrical hazard.. 
same guy who was apartment mining and putting ASICs on carpet right?
yah that guy aint too smart. alabama? makes a lot more sense now...
