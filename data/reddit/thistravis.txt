Very helpful responses.  If you really do want crypto to succeed you may want to consider hopping off those elitist high horses and help educate the general public.  But thats just my 2 satoshi.

Thanks - that is pretty much what I thought.  I guess I was curious if anyone had any ideas on what could be created to supplant these systems...as there has to be something better than "you hold all of your own money because that's the only way its truly yours".  I'd love to read/hear more about what people are speculating can replace these systems, if something like this even exists.  
  
I know most people believe the thing holding back crypto is not being able to spend it easily for daily purchases, but in my opinion while that is definitely a piece of the puzzle, until someone can safely convert 100% of their fiat to crypto without being labeled a maniac because they could lose it all for a variety of petty reasons (robbery, fire, hardware failure, forgetting/losing your seed etc) I don't think the masses will join.  I know many people see this as a great thing because they can get in early...but I want the masses, without them we never get rid of what you listed above.

Totally...I've lurked around here for awhile and finally made a serious post asking about how bitcoin can grow and propagate in a completely trust-less environment and only got 1 semi real response (and that response included things that would still happen with bitcoin with no recourse but where the "non-trustworthy institutions" correct with a phone call).  
I get it trust sucks but so does doing everything yourself if it comes with extreme limitations.  I hope people come around and stop 'trust shaming' any solution that provides a value but rather helps minimize the attack vector or propose another solution that could work better.  Just screaming "DONT TRUST ANYTHING" is petulant.
