[Check this out]( There are probably far way LESS people that will ever hold at least 1 BTC ... maybe as few as just 800,000 people!
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:21:08
And that's one of the many reasons I'm closing all my accounts with them after being a loyal customer for 15 years!
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:24:55
Countless Dev hours and testing and bug fixing... It started in 2008 but the bitcoin network wasn't launched until 1/3/2009
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:57:05
@_date: 2019-07-13 09:00:39
Best answer possible!
@_date: 2019-07-13 07:43:34
/s ma Dude
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:49:01
Because they don't fund with débit cards Danielsan
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:24:13
Tax reporting is voluntary.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:11:31
Yeah, it's called wealth transfer...
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:49:59
Name checks out
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:24:07
Fuck her! We don't need the ECB
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:02:34
Moon duh !!
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:58:20
HODL FTW !!
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:06:09
On the Ledger you have to constantly install/remove Apps in order to access your cryptos!!
Horrible UX!
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:58:25
Check the volume on a big price action movement.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:22:07
Duh ! HODL FTW !!
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:56:19
Another one bites the dust...
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:06:47
He's fucking retarded.
Also this is from Nov '18
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:39:50
Never invest more than what you can afford to lose!
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:52:26
And they also have the companion mobile App
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:17:38
Big fees? Are you high?? The fee ranges from 0% to 0.26%
Stop using shitty websites like coinsmart
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:46:03
Kraken.com is best for CAD then use Exodus.io
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:15:55
Well you don't add the two bro... One is for buying and the other selling
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:52:47
Use the Trezor!
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:00:21
Use Kraken.com
Fees range from 0% to 0.26%
@_date: 2019-07-13 08:55:37
You're new, I forgive you
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:51:10
Redditor for a Day
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:26:42
True that
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:02:01
This :
@_date: 2019-07-13 09:34:04
You can say thank you to the US Government for that!
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:24:26
Trezor FTW, best integration and security features.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:35:51
I do understand the risks
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:20:32
Yeah, doesn't matter the asset class but with bitcoin, it will be a transfer of wealth like never before!
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:13:58
Stop being a cheap fuck and pay for the services you want! It will help support the people who work hard making these tools!
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:25:03
Damn right son!!
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:01:18
Is it decentralized or custodial?
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:31:52
On Kraken.com but not with a debit card bitcoinsan...
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:33:57
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:46:18
Yeah, it "only" takes 4,000 bitcoins to move the markets right now... This will change as adoption increases tho, making BTC less volatile.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:55:01
Exodus has a 3+ year track record, what are you talking about
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:29:02
Dat Clown, he's just a jealous no-coiner
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:42:42
Add me to the list
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:04:36
Ask KIN... That's what they are building.
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:59:31
I'll take your word for it Grandma
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:36:49
Stop trading, just HODL !!
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:03:12
What other exchange with operations in Canada are left?? After QuadrigaCX's fiasco, I would only trust a reputable exchange and Kraken is one of the largest, oldest (2011) and never got hacked!
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:06:05
Karma harvesting son ?! Tho you're 100% correct.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:02:57
For JPY yeah, it's the best and safest option Fomosan
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:49:07
So awesome!!! Congrats to you Sir!
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:04:33
Thanks for taking the time to share that with us! HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:16:59
Nah, he's in for the long term with his bank �� 
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:20:44
Yes it is...
@_date: 2018-09-16 07:23:02
Anything about bitcoin can change, it is just code but changing the block-generation reward to allow more than an asymptotic limit of 21 million coins would require a hard fork.  
It would be a contentious hard fork, because many people strongly believe that the original plan should not be changed to dilute existing coins and it wouldn't be "bitcoin" anymore.
Increasing the total supply is [one of the prohibited changes]( .
As for the lost coins, they gone Buh-bye!
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:59:36
He's not proving anything! He actually got caught forging docs in Court!
Everybody can submit a claim to the white paper, it's an open source software...
@_date: 2018-09-16 07:32:22
Not necessarily, but unless you want the current distribution model to stay in place, then yeah you'd have to significantly increase the mining rewards...
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:51:27
Try them 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:07:48
You can always try 
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:22:37
Well said!!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:29:33
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:45:06
I guess he will be buying a shit ton of Ƀ 
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:53:05
Probably throwaway or troll
@_date: 2018-09-16 07:16:04
Nope... It would require a *hard* fork 
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:42:10
Welcome to crypto!
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:32:23
I have... It's still pending but like you said, at this point nothing to lose!
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:52:59
Link is broken?
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:45:22
@_date: 2018-08-02 04:23:49
Too bad for him, I'm not selling!
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:19:56
Why can't you understand DCA is not about buying the dip son???
Whether it goes up or down... I buy... regardless of the price... hence [DOLLAR COST AVERAGING]( !
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:41:23


@_date: 2018-05-26 17:07:04
The bubble will get bigger next time around... We're just getting started!
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:05:45
Seems reasonable... Get Bitcoin already people!!
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:08:43
Bears make money, bulls make money... Pigs get slaughtered.
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:31:25
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:21:35
When moon?
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:02:14
Agreed! Total joke... It's not like other industries aren't using energy to be able to stay in business ah!
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:08:04
I like bread wallet!
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:29:49
Switch to Kraken, problem solved.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:20:02
You're a pretty daft person if you didn't sell in the first 10% drop from ATH! But your have to even stupider to sell now!!
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:40:14
Talk about a fuckfest!
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:57:08
Mad GAINZ!
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:17:35
Somehow Trump is helping us...
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:52:17
Best answer ever!
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:47:55
If you're not gonna actively trade, get them off to a wallet like Exodus.io
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:59:55
People would increase their Ƀ stacks that's all... There's no stopping this freight train now!!
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:44:47
Oh yeah? At least read the article I linked and maybe you'll sound less of an idiot in your next comment...


@_date: 2018-05-27 23:05:10
Get a ShiftCard or Monaco card
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:54:28
Correct ! We just need adoption...
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:49:52
I guess he must be... That's why I've been DCAing since 2012 so I'm good ah!
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:50:55
DCA isn't a strategy for buying falling stocks, there's nothing I can do to help you bro... Good luck in your life!
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:17:56
You won't be taxed... And you won't have to pay $60 to pay $1.50 either.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:53:57
The herd is coming!
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:01:11
I'll help you friend, send me $400 in Ƀ and I'll send you $4,000 back to help with your financial woes.
Or you could send $800 to get $8,000... Up to you.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:52:33
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:35:13
I'm gonna hold off for the trillionaires club 
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:27:33
Ma Dude !!! You know your history �� 
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:08:43
And so it begins!
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:28:54
Until higher adoption, I use ShiftCard to use Ƀ and pay for things anywhere I need...
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:02:38
Care to elaborate? Were you attempting to buy or sell cryptos?
Are they holding your USD? Your cryptos? Both? Give support the time to get to your ticket...
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:20:29
Ma dude!! You gets it...
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:31:09


Someone needs to read the white paper again... Bitcoin is money and Blockchain is the protocol.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:45:56
Ƀ FTW 
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:56:18
Funny! Not so funny...
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:11:25
You don't get the concept of DCA do you? I've been using this strategy since 2012, won't be changing now...
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:05:50
Same... Mostly depends on your bank.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:55:28
Yes because eventually, these "small" amounts of cryptos are gonna be worth more and more as adoption grows...
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:31:13
Redditor for 2 weeks... 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:10:56
Yeah, I've only been in Ƀ since 2011 and work in the industry... I think I know a thing or two about all this. But thanks for being a redditor for 7 weeks and posting this, gives you a ton of credit.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:11:43
Blockchain is a database. Bitcoin is the unit of currency (the money) operating on this cryptographic protocol.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:14:54
Dat pearl necklace tho!
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:10:47
Yeah okay... When people like "Crypto Shao Lin" post these kind of recycled articles, it sounds more like shilling than information.
Esp. when the only "hidden gem" he talks about is "Cashaa"... 
So yeah, same article, different shitcoin!
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:37:31
Like they have an option!! If they don't, they will be left behind in the new economy.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:38:03

@_date: 2018-05-19 21:33:34
I've been in Ƀ 9 years and I still check my holdings daily ha!
Yes, I'm an addict but I'm also in the green...
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:03:46
Yep, nothing can stop his freight train!

@_date: 2018-05-28 00:51:05
Never gonna use them ever again!
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:03:08
You missed 2011 and 2013...
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:10:34

He's clearly picking up some on the cheap now that he missed the wagon 9 years ago ah!
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:27:15


@_date: 2018-05-20 21:33:11
Bad ass dude!!! I'm gonna get one! When is this new one gonna up for sale you think?
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:55:27
No, they'd just have to HODL 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:06:01
Same article, different shitcoin

2 weeks old bro 
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:11:29
Cardano! All positive.
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:57:06
I sure didn't, I'm a HODLer and I DCA
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:40:32
Duh! Strong hands guys!! Strong hands!!!
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:27:59
He new to reddit �� 
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:11:01
Yeah, it's been a few months now... Transfers have been taking 5-8 days to clear.
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:37:53
Roger Ver getting bitch slapped! Love it!!
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:11:41
Fucking hypocrites !! Good for us tho!
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:22:31
Find someone on localbitcoin. Yes, price will fluctuate. Shouldn't take longer than 10 mins to transfer.
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:23:49
Great article!
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:26:27
Most people can't explain what the central banking system is or what a fractional reserve is!
@_date: 2018-05-31 06:53:51
They might become the first Trillionaires...
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:09:01
Bitcoin = Growth^20
Fixed 
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:48:50
I guess bitcoin didn't get the memo... It dropping...
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:17:48
And it can't be stopped!
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:38:36


Nuff said
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:54:04
Great... Just what we needed to drive Ƀ adoption!
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:44:54
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:00:13
Cool infographic !
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:48:57
Duh! One needs to HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:25:00
Amen brother!
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:50:02
Not the first, nor the last! Check r/21MClub for more 
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:44:14
And so it begins...
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:01:05
The stupidity is strong with this one... I forgive you, you've only been on reddit 7 months. You can now go back to playing with your babies...
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:29:59
Get your coins out and delete your account...
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:04:10
Start another 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:41:41
It's a scam, as long as you don't follow the link you're good... They don't have your Coinbase info, they assume you have Coinbase IMO.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:14:33
Possible... Or OTC sale...
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:35:11
If they were to provide custody solutions, this could be a huge news as it would be opening the door to Pension Funds and Institutions.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:14:05
I'll take a best offer, this is your last chance tho!
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:45:13
JP Morgan... Please shut up!
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:52:52
You completely miss the point of Ƀ and Blockchain. Keep studying...

I call bullshit too! OP doesn't seem to understand that there are 2^256 different private keys. The chance of finding a used wallet, with a balance is small, but it is not impossible...

The abbreviation "XBT" comes from the International Standards Organization (ISO) that maintains a list of internationally recognized currencies.

Wallets work globally. Exchanges work locally.
Use Exodus.io
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:55:12
I'm all for open source but Exodus.io is a trusted partner of ShapeShift and they've been great members of the community.
It's a fully decentralized wallet and you can restore your private keys into another wallet anytime you want.

Eventually, OTC trades do get reflected in the spot price, just not as immediately or violently as if these trades were made on the open market...
Also worth noting that OTC traders don't get the spot price! So if BTC is at $3,400 spot, OTC desks would :
* sell them 50 BTC at $3,485
* buy their 50 BTC at $3,315
OTC traders often have to pay a (small) premium for the right to avoid "slippage" on a large size orders and guarantee a fixed price for the whole order size.

You're talking about a 51% attack, which would give the attacker only a 1% advantage, which would not be enough to change the existing chain.
Since the chain would be under attack, a temporary fork would occur and if at any moment the attacker loses that 1% advantage, it's game over and they would have to start from scratch.
Currently, there's 65,000,000 TH/s protecting the chain... Good luck attacking it.
If one wants to fork the code, like BCH did, one could try to steal some hashing power but when all know what would happen in the end...

@_date: 2019-06-19 02:23:21
Fuck taxes
@_date: 2019-02-08 04:27:20
Yeah, not exactly... If someone is willing to buy 1,000 BTC, they are gonna have to pay more than $3,300 because there's not enough BTC available on the order book at that price!
Most likely, that person will have to pay 25bps of premium... In the other hand, that guarantees them the fixed price for the entire 1,000 BTC order.
Now, if they decide to dump these BTC on the open market, then yet, price will drop and they can buy back at a discount. That's what's called "liquidity".
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:18:45

@_date: 2019-12-26 17:41:23
There's a middle ground and the fact that you ask this question in the first place shows you couldn't audit Open Source code anyways and would rely on others.
Exodus is a good mobile wallet, is it great? No but for 90% of users that's all they need.
If you're on Android, then Samourai is your best option. Then get a Trezor.
@_date: 2019-10-09 04:00:00

Spot is for the masses, taking OTC I into consideration for buying / selling small amounts is not gonna work either.
On top of that, you have algorithmic traders, high frequency traders and derivatives traders too...
One should only worry about the competitors in the trading strategies they are comfortable with IMO unless you run a trading firm...

Instead of basing the graph on a multiple from starting price, let's see how much wealth each bubble generated/wiped out from peak?
•	⁠Dot-Com bubble : By the end of the stock market downturn of 2002, stocks had lost $5 trillion in market capitalization since the peak (The NASDAQ index peaked on March 10, 2000 at 5,048 points and is well over 7,000 points today)
•	⁠Housing bubble : The Treasury Department put the total lost household wealth at $19.2 trillion
•	⁠Tulipomania was a joke and didn't disrupt anything and created nothing!
Let's face it, bitcoin is acting like a bubble but the disruption and innovation it brought us will generate far more wealth than it will ever destroy! 
Time for the big banks to accept it.

There will be less than 16M total Ƀ due to lost and locked wallets.
Satoshi Nakamoto owns 1M and 4-5M are in the hands of whales that will never sell. 
Available supply will be less than 8M when the last coin is created.

I’m not a day trader of Ƀ either and I use Ƀ everyday to buy things with! SHIFT Card is a perfect example!
I get as much USD into Ƀ specifically because in the LT strategy to HODL I know I'll see better returns while still being able to pay for things I need to on a day-to-day basis.

@_date: 2018-04-08 04:12:07
There's a taxable event when you sell your BTC (which could be at profit or loss) not for just holding BTC. You can HODL and never have to pay taxes on the "unrealized" profits.
Same goes when you pay using BTC, that's a taxable event and you are responsible for determining if there was a profit or a loss for that event. I'm not tax expert, so I have no clue how you, as a minor, would be affected by all this since but this [article should be a good start](
In short, there's no legal requirements preventing you to buy/sell BTC. Exchanges do have KYC (Know Your Customer) rules in place and often require you to be at least 18 but that's just to cover their asses and you could get your parent(s) to approve your Coinbase account for you if you wanted.

Yes indeed, you said said cryptocurrencies are securities. And yes, you are wrong. You even used that stupid argument for determining if it was legal for him to buy/own cryptos!


Are you that dumb?? One (minor or not) can legally buy cryptos at ATMs, local meet ups, mine it, etc.
Your "research" only pertains to how exchanges better comply with SEC rules and securities laws, not individual acquiring cryptos.


Not **all** of them and this would only apply if you were to buy cryptos via an exchange, which would be required to comply with SEC regulations. 
TL;DR It's wrong to think that cryptos are considered securities for both the purpose of "legally" buying them and for the purpose of potential tax burden.

Well, there are forensic companies our there like [Chainalysis]( that specialize in tracking Bitcoin transactions but unless you commit a crime, chances are you are good to go.
See, once you use a private wallet, you become almost 100% anonymous but let's say you use that wallet to buy stuff on Overstock.com then buy drugs or hire an assassin, these companies manage to figure out (thanks to metadata) that your wallet was used for both transactions, then trace it back to your Coinbase account and you end up in prison.

Bitcoin is an ideology, people like me whom started buying / using Ƀ since 2011 and before don't care how low it goes because to us it's not a speculative tool. 
Miners, like myself, will continue supporting the network no matter what. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:34:52
Nope, but anybody can since it's on a public ledger (tho nobody will know it's you).
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:22:52
You jinxed it!!!
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:13:50

@_date: 2018-04-03 04:29:57
TA does work for Ƀ and cryptos just like they work for FX. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:34:01
Congrats but yeah, it's a bear market so be strong and HODL because it could drop some more...

@_date: 2018-04-04 16:37:28
Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. Should you and Jeb receive what's left of the remaining 160K BTC and BCH, I suggest you create a fund and put someone the community will trust to manage it and do good in the world.
There's more to gain in promoting blockchain technologies than simply redistributing fiat IMO. 
Bonne chance, c'est clairement pas facile de gérer ta situation et en tant qu'utilisateur en 2012, MtGox a également aidé l'adoption de Ƀ !

Kraken is owned by [Payward, Inc.]( and is a Delaware Corp. which is registered in California Secretary of State's database but wasn't founded in London as far as I know (not relevant). [Being a US based company]( does have an impact as it makes it easier to take legal actions against the company if needed (as opposed to Bitstamp).
Having a forced arbitration clause isn't unusual and not a sign of being shady...
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:48:25
Agreed! Kraken is one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the US (based in San Francisco, CA) and they maintain full reserves to prevent any possibility of a bank run.
Bitstamp is HQed in London so depending where you live, this could have an impact.

It's on the fucking IRS website! You bet your ass my statement holds up as an argument against your comment son hahah!


The SEC doesn't regulate how much taxes you owe!! His question is about the potential tax burden. You're confusing regulation over the exchanges and buying/selling/owning cryptos.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:58:56
Your question is?

But, if you buy a house with your Ƀ you no longer HODL...
Should be renamed HouseSODL 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:48:13
So you're saying it would be easier to take legal actions against Bitstamp!?
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:20:18
Is that a good or a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:27:51

Shit is sleek!!!
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:51:47
Very possible... Coinbase &amp; Gemini use the same spread trick AND tack on addition fees!
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:27:02
They will add more but it's a GREAT start! Coinbase and other US exchanges are finally getting some competition... Robinhood offers BTC and ETH tho... ~~but I think they charge some fees~~ turns out they don't!

Stop it, you're making too much sense!
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:53:52
I'm no expert but I'd say close to none... Bitcoin forensics is expensive so the crime must be worth the $$$ the US Gvt will have to pay to use these services.
If you were to ONLY use that electrum wallet for these types of purchases, you'll be just fine. Now, if your supplier takes Monero, use that! Use an exchange like Binance that doesn't require you to register personal info and send your BTC from Coinbase to your Electrum wallet (never send from one exchange to another) then to Binance then get XMR then send the XMR to a [Monero wallet]( and buy small amount of drugs (hypothetically of course).
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:23:40
Keep HODLing! There is no turning back now, adoption is on the move, it sure could go lower but it will never go to zero. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:10:13

Damn you're a clown... Naive and amateur, that's your come back?


Bro, wake up bro!! I got in bitcoin way before you realized it could go up 1,000% then drop 80%! I'm all good bro, I'm hella chill... Even if BTC goes back to $3, I still won't have a *difficult time* about it.


ORLY?? Please, do at least some basic research before give us your version of the "*truth*" you ignorant, condescending clown! It's not the first time BTC shoots up before pulling back and it won't be the last!
There has been **13 major corrections &gt;30%** and at least **4 major corrections &gt;80%** from ATH levels since 2012.
Each time, we have *know-it all* little bitches like you jumping all over the place saying we're delusional, in denial, that it will NEVER go back up and yet... here we are... 
* Last 2 years	+$3,117.34	**+415.25%**
* Last 3 years	+$3,479.60	**+895.75%**	
* Last 5 years	+$3,034.03	**+363.78%**	
* Last 7 years	+$3,865.06	**+129,266.33%**
But you must be right, this time it's the END because it's down [66.93% in the last year]( Quick, let me sell all my BTC for some shit USD!
Stay woke! Buy some BTC!!

Look who's talking, being on reddit for a week... You, like many do not understand the difference between currency and money.
The currency in your pocket is a medium of exchange, backed by nothing, constantly debased by means of the fractional reserve system and persistent increase of the supply. It's worthless basically... 
Money is all of the things a currency can do, plus a store of value over a long period of time. 
Let me educate you... Before World War I, each note that a Treasury issued would say that there have been deposited with the United States Treasury $20 in gold coin payable to the bearer upon demand. The money (gold) was in the vault. **The currency was a note they gave you that was a claim check. Only a claim check on the money.**
The same as if you go to the dry cleaners and you give them your shirt and they give you a claim check for your shirt... The value is that shirt at the dry cleaners. *Not the piece of paper that says that you own that shirt.* 
You woke yet?? But you nailed it tho, USD is currency but Bitcoin is money. We're only 9 years in the Blockchain revolution and only little bitches like you point to the fact that it has lost 80% of it's value in 1 year but fail to acknowledge the immense technological advancements blockchain has brought up at the same time.
Yeah, you salty you didn't get on the Bitcoin train in 2016 or 2015 or 2013 or 2011 or 2009 but guess what, it's not too late! Give it another 10 years and we'll see who is better off... You or me.
P.s. Sorry that you can't seem to accept the fact that the dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. So not very good as a store of value...

Housing market dropped 35% in the wake of the 2008 crash. Tell me about your investments?
Fiat currencies are worthless and doomed to fail. The current monetary system is a scam. 
Even if you had bought Bitcoin 4-5 years ago, you'd be still better off and nobody could take that away from you (as opposed to a bank run) and it won't devalue because debasement is impossible and there is no fractional reserve or central banks!
Now go play with your barbie.
