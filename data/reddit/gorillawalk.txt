I’m down with all that. Will still take the Lambo while I’m at it though.

Corporations can certainly be mean and nasty and shitty, but not as mean and nasty and shitty as government / government regulators. Over the long term, government tends to grow and become increasingly burdensome and self-interested... And while corporations can certainly screw people over, corporations do not have the power of the government to force you to participate with them - at least not until the regulators have enough power that they become worth buying off.
This is more of a long term view I take however... and I'm sure we could go down that rabbit hole, but probably wouldn't be useful as I see regulation basically guaranteed due to your belief being so widespread. That's not a dig at you - I disagree with you - but I do recognize your opinion will probably win out in the real world so that's why I say "because of people like you." Sounds meaner than I intended.
Bitcoin itself may not be easily regulated in the purest sense, but it can still be effectively regulated by regulating payment processors, banks and eventually even merchants if necessary - and eventually relegating BTC (or any other crypto) back to a black market type of thing.
I don't even know where I'm going with all of this anymore. I just don't want to see the introduction of more regulations on anyone because I believe the US still has effective legal mechanisms right now to deal with the most outrageous thievery/fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:27:22
Regulation isn’t the answer here. All it does is transfer the power of manipulation and connivery from one party to another.
Everyone acts like blatant theft and fraud are suddenly legal because BTC isn’t an SEC security. Theft is still theft and fraud is still fraud.
There are also lawsuits and class action lawsuits which can very often be won.
Regulation just makes this whole idea of a decentralized currency fall way short of its goal. That being said, I don’t see how regulation is avoidable - because of people like you.

Because he’s a fake fucking fraud.

Seriously. Article reads as though it was produced by an off-brand AI.

I nominate we end these daily discussion threads. 
Every post in here is either a repeat of the same arguments over and over and over (does anyone on Reddit ever have anything to say besides repeat the same points everyone else has always made?) or is just something totally retarded.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:42:32
Yup. Bernietards just lack education, information and history. They literally have no idea what they’re saying. 
It’s not their fault they don’t respect the awesome experiment called America that did more for world progress than any other nation in history. They were mostly raised by failed baby boomers and taught by ultra far left radical teachers from high school through college.
It’s too bad they take it all for granted and just wish America could copy Sweden. Such a meme around here and it’s a joke for so many reasons. Reddit leftists just clap for each other like seals whenever someone says “omg Sweden” with zero actual understanding of how the real world works. 
Especially shocking to see it in a bitcoin sub. I guess this place filled up with wishful dreamers since the run to 20k who would be more likely to fall for Bernie and “omg Sweden.”

Yup. Fucked up California and doing their best to fuck up Colorado now. It’s like a plague of dumb locusts that has no idea why it destroys everything in its path.

I guess we have different views of the government's proper role. I personally believe the government should be limited strictly to stepping in when someone else's actions infringe on your basic rights to life, liberty and property. And enforcing contracts. And at the federal level in the United States, it should be limited to the few, specific duties assigned to it by the Constitution.
Simply saying "it exists to protect you from being crushed by the rich and powerful" is too vague and opens the door to government growing in power and abusing that power for its own benefit.
If you expect government to step in and try to "level the playing field" (which is also vague), you will be sorely disappointed every time. The government consists of people just like you and I who can just as easily become corrupt just like anyone else. Giving the government that kind of power only opens the door to abuse.

Lol I admire your honesty. I feel exactly the same.

I’ll buy the yacht, loan it out for BTC and just rent the girls.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:31:52
No, the government does not exist to protect you from billionaires selling some assets.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:10:35
Lmao...  There is no way in HELL I would lend money to some schmuck who just plopped down in the chair opposite me and, when asked what assets he has, told me "bitcoins, bro."
Just lol. But still, good point about Equifax. Frickin scumbags should go to prison for their stupidity.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:28:51
Thank you. Reddit can never be balanced. They must culture worship the shit out of anything that sounds the least bit exotic based on old cliches while jerking each off over how enlightened they are.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:27:25
This. Reddit knows absolutely nothing about trading I’ve learned... except how to parrot pop-sci quotes back and forth all day.
Waiting for the next comment about active trading and monkeys throwing darts. Any minute now...
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:33:40
If that’s what you got from the post, you’re a hopeless retard and shouldn’t be allowed to touch money.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:56:51
Because leftism is an ideology of negativity and nastiness. Leftists think of everything as the glass half empty and constantly walk around with a frown. Why do you think every lefty you meet is such an unhappy person? The ideology appeals to a certain type - the type who has to incessantly interject his foolish political views. It’s basically a compulsion.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:24:06
Nah, don’t listen to this guy^
if you’re gonna put a grand in, just throw it all in now. If price is going to go up long term (which is why youre putting in a grand, right) then you’ll have the best outcome by just tossing it all in now. 
Throwing in 100 here and there is just as random as throwing in 1k all at once, except it takes longer.

You don’t think the US healthcare system is screwed up because it’s too free, do you?
Let me tell you something to look up: AtlasMD concierge health.
It’s amazing how cheap healthcare can be when it’s not tied to government and government-regulated insurance.
Or is affordable healthcare and affordable health insurance not enough? You just want everything to be “free” or what?

What if I told you....
That I'm a bitcoin hodler too??
(And still wouldn't lend shit to your schmuck ass if all you had in assets was BTC)
Serious question here... does anyone here even know WHY assets are wanted for a loan?? And why BTC might be undesirable? Lmao c'mon now guys, you can do better than this.
I love me some BTC, but let's not go full retard here.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:06:41
Sure, if you're trying to trade your way in, go for it. Nothing wrong with that if the guy is willing to give it a shot, but blindly just dollar cost averaging when you actually have the cash on hand is pointless. Not like anyone in fucking would know that though of course lol.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:34:25
I don’t doubt it. But there is a vast gulf between saying you want to short bitcoin and then actually doing it. Don’t think you’d have the cojones.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:19:24
Well.... Shit. That is a good point actually. I retract my nomination and accept my downvotes.
