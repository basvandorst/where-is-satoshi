If you're not a troll, then I think you qualify for benefits.

Ahh yes you should just liquidate everything you own into bitcoin! Of course, then you wouldn't even have a house in the first place to lose! GENIUS!!
Oh wait, even if you only use bitcoin you're still going to need a fucking place to live and it's irrelevant because no one stores their fucking money in the mattress anymore and the impact of losing your house is literally the same as if you had bought all your stuff with bitcoin or real money.

Whenever I heard this incoherent drool disguised as an argument all I can think of is how whoever is saying it is basically saying without religion to reign them in, they'd have no problem going out and killing people.

Probably people who lived there and used it?

The entire premise is nonsense so the question is irrelevant.

If you were what you claim you were you'd be a billionaire, otherwise it's just luck. Same reason why fortune tellers are shit poor until they manage to scam people into thinking they're legit and start to profit off their bogus scams. You offer your advice for a low price until you make a name for yourself and get rich off telling other people bogus advice, despite the fact you should given be able to be the richest and most successful person alive given the abilities you claim to have.
