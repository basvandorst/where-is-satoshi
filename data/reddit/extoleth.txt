Downvoting a solution to help noobs navigate the deck of a ship that has taken on water, is like the rich locking the poor in the sublevels of the sinking Titanic.

He is wrong about the reasons. Crypto currency is not a hedge, it is emerging speculative asset class. To not be in it, is to give up future investment capital. Now, (I am sure he did not mean this) Bitcoin of all the crypto currencies, is the hedge against industrial failure. If you doubted the future would be built in these new rails, than owning Bitcoin along makes sense, because it is stagnent, safe, and sound.

I admit, it is driven by speculation.

Noobs don't send Bitcoin. Bitcoin is like gold now. You just buy and hold it, silly. Now accredited investors will send Bitcoin, but that is for larger transactions, where paying a few dollars is not big deal. /s (actually it's become true)

A private instrument, that is bought and sold on exchanges. I have no use for it, but from some, they are forced to use it. Because its supply is controlled by a board and not an algo, I would not include it in a list of future crypto.

So maybe...
If you had children, you could gift them each 56k tax free. They could always sell, with zero income and gift you back the proceeds. Taxes are lame.

Bitcoin was designed to be used. Meaning sending transactions is using Bitcoin. Buying Bitcoin like a gold coin and just tucking it away in a safe is not Bitcoin, that is collecting.
Sending and receiving crypto currency is fantastic, regardless of what the other party does with it. What is not fantastic is paying $1.50 per transaction.

Not really. It has transferable value. A merchant like Overstock accepts it because it is cheaper, safer and faster than, risker forms of payment, like PayPal, Credit Cards and Checks. Overstock does not collect bitcoins, they merely accept and then pass them on to Coinbase, who is a trusted party and will place USD into Overstocks bank account. Coinbase also does not collect, but algorithmically passes BTC on to interested parties in return for fiat in the bank.
Do you see the cycle and how high fees and slow, unreliable confirmations times, hinder this cycle?

I thought regular offsite BACKUPs was the answer.

2. Format
3. Restore from backup

Investors in "altcoins" do not buy them because they find Bitcoin will fail (1). It that was the case, they would be getting out of the industry altogether. Investors are not in "altcoins" because of a promise of future tech (2), they are actively partaking in the advancements that these platforms allow. And finally investors are not speculating in a niche (3), but are laying the rails for networks that reach into all areas of human life and commerce.
Maybe this post was written 3 years ago when very little had been build, but today, ignoring the active platforms that have already been build is like Microsoft ignoring the iPhone.

That is like searching for quick Linux fixes. The results are always 3-6 years old. Oddly most of the fixes still work, but may not be the most effect means of accomplishing it.

Trading BTC on a centralized service, where they all the keys is great, because there aren't those pesky $1.50 transaction fees or 2 hour confirmation times. /s
I think we found the new use for Bitcoin. Exchanges have replaced Banks, yayeh!

Destroy your copy of Windows and install Antergos.

Best practice; double check address before submitting, as your copy could be incomplete.

You have a Coinbase account, use GDAX.

Why? Because their Bitcoin payments have dropped since people do not want to pay 10% transaction fee to pay their year with PIA?

Apps &amp; Security; the Arch User Repository gives you access to all the apps which are compiled for Linux and Arch being a rolling release distro, they are always up-to-date and thus patched from a security  standpoint.
Why Antergos? It just makes installing Arch easy and their preset apps and theme by default is all you need or just a click away with the AUR.  Ubuntu may have been my recommendation prior to their wireless/network manager issues in that last two release and their current shakeup in dropping Mir and Unity. Once they have settled on Wayland, Gnome, and more apps are being Snapped (snap packages) I may recommend them again.
