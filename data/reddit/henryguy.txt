Digital voting machines have been caught rigged numerous times and the govt wants to make it mandatory to use them. If that happens then, yes, it could be. I'm all for electronic voting but it  should be more administrative. Like we use a central machine at each poll to tally in front of the voter when they turn in. 
Even go so far as to allow a person to see how they voted or didn't vote under the same confidentiality as medical records.

I don't think people understand the market bitcoin will create. Local countries will need an inflationary local currency that is digital as well as easy switch to bitcoin for international use. 
We will see REAL usd tethers, that aren't faux, one day. Japan is on the way to it, Russia as well. So many countries are embracing it at the central bank level whereas other powerhouses will be left to the shit house. 
You cannot only have a deflationary currency as things will only grow in value as companies seek to maintain solvency. So local countries have to have something to trade against bitcoin. If not one day 1btc will equal lambo then people will struggle to get even .1 bitcoin for wages per decade until everything is unattainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:20:21
If you sell the bitcoin the moment you earn it then there would be no capital gains. If you hold the bitcoin and sell once it's value has gone up then you owe taxes on the value difference of (value once sold - value when mined) * federal and/or state capital gains tax rate for short or long term.

You have to consider out of 7 billion people on the planet and only 21 million bitcoin available on the market that price will be dependent on adoption rate. If 10% of the world tries to own a full coin then only 3% of that will be able to. So the price of 4000 isn't high.

It's be easier to envision an exchange as open market with stalls all shilling their own token but in one market. These markets can choose to follow local law and operate locally only or follow international laws and operate out of nation states they choose.
 You can get around the checks for nationality and get bank accounts in other countries but it's usually a pricy thing to accomplish. So you buy local and pay a premium while bracing for the moon. 
It's interesting to think that it's possible to exploit the nation by moving there and cornering the btc market. Don't flood it, drip it out, undercut sharply then reel in with ease of use.

Miner consortiums can lose if their fork is outright denied as they fall behind on the value race of the winning chain. If the people who never left and are mining get the blocks they no longer are mining they can scale up more effectively. 
This is a market and like any other market risks can be taken to increase yield dramatically, corner the old market into a new one or lose some or everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:54:23
Considering that it now isn't diversified as before I'd say that, yes, he is diversified it's just that one of his investments are farther along then the rest. While it is prudent to lock in some gains it'd be an equal risk to remove too much from btc considering the upside. It's also likely that it'd take OPs btc value dropping immensely to cause actual financial burden. 
If I were OP I'd take 5% for a vacation, wherever I want and however many places. I'd take another 10% and move into other promising investments and leave the rest where it is. Maybe even use less depending on overall needed for uber vacation and the cost of the new investments.

Should also state that omg will allow individual merchants to maintain atm for cash in and out of the atmosphere.

People are planning long term, lots of them, on bitcoin. Many investment firms are competing in this to take eachothers money it seems. The trend is after about 30 min of opening it nose dives after massive sell orders. Some are gaining but many are losing.

That's automation for you. The traders have bots that notice downward trends and buy directly without the need to load the Web page. That extreme traffic flow at those times causes bottlenecks for the average end user as the bots steal the throughput first.

It was, though the spreads were about 10x higher then fiat, the mean was better. This is a shakedown I suspect and we just need to stay strong.

Tell that to the now dead alphabay developer. I bet he was more secure than any of us but still got found out eventually.

Yeah it got pump and dumped. Now I'm just hoping the inner circle of investors who drove this pump m dump rampage don't leave abandon it altogether or I'm set to lose 1k.

I'd imagine they need the exchange of crypto to fiat to prove a gain for taxation. I can't remember if Australia considers it legit currency yet but even so it's only bitcoin so exchanging from btc to ripple or lite coin to realize gains then back into btc on a correction wouldn't flag it. 
If the x changes are required to convert any transaction over into fiat value then that goes out the window.

I'll laugh if the price skyrockets and nothing happens. Remember that reddit is usually a minority of the online user base. Yes we draw from around the world but on average the majority does not frequent reddit.

This is following typical stock trends bc dedicated investors have entered the market hence the seeming stability. We will hit more plateaus now with small divot but the fall will only follow a large rise here on out. Now if u read solid intellectual news on the bitcoin falling, like outlawed across the US and other nations then panic dumping is worth pursuing. 
For now it is best to hold position. I predict btc to hit 5k by end of year or beginning of quarter 4. With next year seeing 7.5k with 10k being dependent on global assimilation. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:21:07
Agreed. I'd be more surprised if it goes down then goes up.

Sounds reasonable, day trade bitcoin, trade to litecoin, move to a wallet then an exchange with a higher rate and cash out. Wish it was my job to do that kinda stuff.

Fees could have ate at it some depending on the transaction fee allocated or any maintenance fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:21:43
Were set for another dip or does anyone see a rise incoming? The graphs I see show a short term dip followed by stability then another 10-20% gain based off past trends.

The old business saying is something like, competition keeps me strong but makes me look better too.

End of may it hit 2900 then dropped to something like 2300. That's the corrective dip. Any further would be a catastrophic collapse of the btc ideal. Now we are on the hills climbing back up the proverbial mountain. We are likely to hit small downward phases but ultimately the goal is the mountain peak, which we will likely never meet. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:17:44
No clue.

Ethereums core function demands an average transaction time of 14s. If it, on average, takes longer it lowers the computational difficulty. If it's faster it raises the difficulty. It's goal is to keep miners working at a steady pace and avoid the empty block possibility of instanteous tx. The market cap required to keep miners working indefinitely at 0s tx time is the gdp of some civilized nations.

It's investors diversifying hoping to catch the next bitcoin for a 1-5 yr retirement plan or a weekly paycheck. 
I believe bitcoin will be the next gold standard while other, altcoins, will have valid market share for everyday transactions. Yes lots of retailers want to take bitcoin but that's on the prospect of their $5 coffee being worth $10 tomorrow. 
Eventually it'll rely on more stable altcoins everyday while bitcoin becomes speculated like other traditional markets. Other cryptos will become currency while bitcoin becomes the bank... in my eyes. 
What does this mean? It means institutions will build around storing your coins ultimately in bitcoin with conversion rates for altcoins based on your regions mining authority and/or the global mining consensus. Most retailers will accept any of them by using these institutions to instantly transfer them to btc but at a fee similar to taxation. Taxation will cease as autonomy grows and governments allow people to thrive without a job in hopes of profiting off the ones whom want to learn and grow. 
A dystopia if you will but to some, a utopia of anarchy.

It's accurate to an extent but needs to account in terms of solar and wind power as that is how most major operations are powered. If bitcoin sees increased throughput it'll be awesome.

What if bitcoin was secretly created by these companies and they are silently awaiting the turn of financial commerce to come out as the bladerunner esque mega corps to rule the world.

Exactly, I totally agree with you. Whay I am saying is now. Now amazon has proven a long record of growth so it's a good risk. Earlier it was a wonder or a maybe. I never doubted it, just used it. 
Everything can be considered a brt but if it proves it's worth its only a bet in the long term. It'd be like saying Michael Jordan was a bet. Nobody knew how far he'd fly but boy did he fly. Maybe not as far as speculated but still quite a run.

Hey that's not half bad for a quick story. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:28:50
Hmm interesting. I'll be doing a lot of reading on arbitrage trading. Thanks!  
Makes sense. U need to be able to buy at a moment from any of the xchanges to make a living. I'm more interested in growing my savings by day trading bitcoin and altcoin across exchanges. Some of the spreads are nice. 
Also, I haven't read that cryptos are subject to capital gains in the US yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:18:48
A good sign! Less volatility is good for the average investor while high volatility is good for day traders. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:54:51
I love it because the fees seem to be good, the design is easy to read. I wish they incorporated a historic price chart and not just a ledger read out though. I'd prefer to use them for everything and not need multiple sites to view price data.

Agreed. The coverage from August 1st will do nothing but create a temporary bubble while techies squabble over seemingly minute details in relation to the masses. 
I for one am excited because I frequently trade GBTC via stock which trades at a 75-110% of btc due to Ira/day/intra day traders whom cannot directly purchase. If btc keeps increasing it is wise to buy at sub $490/stock and sell at 520/stock. GBTC has proven to move, up or down, $20~ a day. For a stock that is a good spread and if frequently watch Google search results coupled with live btc values in the US thn you can make 10-30% every 2-5 days depending on the market spread. 
More coverage means less spread on average and less coverage with more volatility in price means more volatility in GBTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:28:12
That would mean that fiat is worthless compared to crypto and thus the $1000 comparison becomes useless due to it having no buying power. That would be the point where people simply say, "That's half a bitcoin??? That must be for rich people."
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:27:20
If the news wasn't so positive and the large solo investors not already diversifying into bitcoin then I'd agree. If the history of bitcoin was rife with ups and downs that it didn't recover I'd agree. It's of course still a risk but if I can put my savings into it, stocks, bonds and alt coins while seeing a 30% year over year gain vs sitting in my bank, why not? I already do it with stocks and see a 3-7% gain on any month based on how often I call drops then why not btc? 
Though I'll probably only add to my btc during drops and just hodl until it's car or house buying time.

Stocks of respected companies with a proven history of profit are not bets. They are long term investments. Amazon, nvidia, Google (alphabet inc) are not bets. They are guaranteed profit earners. Maybe not this week but in the long term. Just look at their five year charts and try to see where they go down, hard. They didn't. 
NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA are sure fires. The thing is, when do I buy. People seem to think that a short term loss is a loss of money. NO. There is a term called, realizing gains or losses, which occurs when you sell. Until you sell they are potential losses. 
I have 11 shares of Nintendo of America because their history is skyrocketing profits for shareholders. As well as nvidia and a few smaller suppliers of bitcoin and tesla. I may "lose" $500 today but in a week that will turn into profit. In a year, I know they will generate growth. 
I personally recommend SCTFF or us cobalt because they are pure play (ethically sourced) cobalt minded excavators. Now they are worth .57c a share but once they begin mining and selling... much more. They have the capability to mine and sell $50bil in cobalt at today's prices. Tesla, while they produce cars, also produces good batteries with plans for four more gigafactories. Even if tesla fails as an auto maker, unlikely, they will realize gains when others need their supply of batteries which will be sourced from us cobalt and other pure play suppliers. 
Nintendo makes a good product which has high demand and lowe supply. They will continue to realize gains. Nvidia provides the best gpu while also maintaining large mainframes of servers and tech for ai. They will continue as well. These are things to pay attention to, not the short term, the long term.
