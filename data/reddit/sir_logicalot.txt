That's a different question.
There is a significant barrier in converting satoshis vs uBTC.


It seems objectively harder given the assumption that you are used to working with base 10 (almost every human) and are used to working with groups of 1000 (1000, 1 million) which is most people.
6.1432 BTC is 6.1432 million bits.
The same equivalence isn't present with Satoshis.

Actually that's precisely how the current legacy financial payment systems work, and with far higher risk than 99.999% success rate.
If bitcoin does it with 99.999% success rate then we're doing better than current systems, but I suspect you can get the success rate with bitcoin up to more like 99.9999999%.

You paid more like 0.0001 BTC from blockchain.info.
From coinbase when you sent, coinbase paid the ~0.0001 BTC fee for you, so you didn't notice it.
You can try a "Custom Send" from blockchain.info with a 0 mining fee set, but whether that transaction actually goes through depends on your luck, and a first confirmation will usually take many hours at best if you pay no fee, and may never confirm.
The bottom line is that bitcoin has transaction fees, and for now they are pretty high (0.0001 BTC = 4 cents USD). One day changes to bitcoin and its ecosystem might make the fee smaller.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:44:15
So it's not about people being to cheap to pay a fee, it's actually that you think that the main chain should only be used for large transactions.
So you can see how when you say "Go pay a fee you cheapskates!", you aren't really addressing the issue.

Your argument is that fees are going up because transaction demand is going up.
My argument is that changes to bitcoin can increase transaction 'supply' (e.g. LN would allow more transactions to take place).

Once again, you are arguing about something else and you are not disagreeing with me.
Neither you or I know what fees will be in the future, and I'm not interested in speculating about that, just like I wouldn't want to speculate about what the future price of a bitcoin will be.
The only point I was ever trying make was that LN (or anything that increases transaction "supply") has the effect of putting downward pressure on fees. This alone doesn't mean fees go down. It just means there is downward pressure. If transaction demand stays the same when adding LN, then fees go down.
If demand continues to go up (you and I both think it will) then fees can still go up.

The [whitepaper]( is agnostic about that issue.
Original bitcoin code had a much larger blocksize limit than the current one, and Satoshi explicitly said that he intended to only temporarily reduce the limit. That's the bitcoin I invested in.

You are arguing that there isn't any difference between a 0.0001 BTC and a 0 fee?
There is a huge confirmation time difference. You won't even get a confirm *ever* with a 0 fee in some cases where the same transaction with a 0.0001 fee transaction will.

In the long run so far blocks are not 100% full all the time, yes.
But if there is a spike in transaction volume (like today where we have a backlog of 10 MB) then if you want your transaction included NOW instead of 20 blocks from now, then you have to pay extra. So fees increase.

Yes. And we are arguing about which fork we want to win.
Arguing whether we should have a fork with X fixed coins max, vs. X *variable* coins by some voting mechanism built into the fork are two different things. Same goes for blocksize and block reward.
In other words we are talking about voting built into a bitcoin fork, you are talking about users voting for a fork, which is a voting system that exists outside of the bitcoin code.

I linked you the Sidechains PDF that is pretty in depth about the technical detail of how the peg is accomplished, though my high level explanation was pretty clear I thought.
CP do not have a fixed peg to a bitcoin value so I don't understand how you can compare these at all.
A sidechain can have a guaranteed exact value that is the same as a bitcoin (or a fraction of a bitcoin or whatever multiplier is chosen).
CP cannot have this.
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:11:58


Yes. I do. And after that happened, XCP tokens float in value.
Compare that to what happens with a pegged sidechain. There is no value that floats relative to a bitcoin.
This is a difference between them. It is a difference independent of whether or not we think it is a good or bad difference, by the way.
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:59:39
Counterparty is a coin that floats in value on its own. Like for example litecoin does.
Rootstock is a coin that is equal to a multiple of a bitcoin.
This is one major difference between these two coins.


The value of the token is pegged to a bitcoin. You get a rootstock token by "locking up" X bitcoins. You get your bitcoins back by "locking up" X rootstock tokens. Hence there is a peg of X bitcoins = 1 rootstock token.
I guess you don't understand the concept of sidechains? See this: 
The fully distributed version of that tech isn't here yet, so they accomplish something similar with a federated network.
I really don't care much about Rootstock or Counterparty. I'm just telling you the difference between them, since you asked.
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:11:49
That should discourage that behavior, until only 0.01% of cases result in forgetting to do this...

It has no peg to a bitcoin, which sidechains can achieve when desired.

With CP you burn bitcoins and get CP tokens. Once, at XCP inception. You can't ever get your bitcoins back.
With a sidechain you lock up bitcoins and get sidechain tokens. Then you can lock up sidechain tokens and get your bitcoins back.
This is how a sidechain has a peg and a sidechain token can be always equal in value to for example 0.1 bitcoins, instead of having a separate price market for the sidechain tokens like XCP has.
These two things are different.
Make sense?

I mean that it doesn't have a bitcoin peg. It is not pegged to bitcoin at a fixed multiplier, as rootstock is.
So in that sense it is an altcoin, not a sidechain.
A rootstock token is X bitcoins, where X is a constant.

CP is not pegged to bitcoin just because proof of burn was used when issuing CP tokens.
I don't think you know what a peg is.


Fixed peg is a difference.


I doubt they will choose 1:1, but even if they did, you still need a token as a sidechain token is not a bitcoin, it is just pegged to a bitcoin's value.


It is kind of hard actually, as it requires being able to temporarily lock up bitcoins in order to guarantee the peg.
CP doesn't have such a locking mechanism for example. Bitcoins were "locked up" (burnt) at CP token issuance, but those bitcoins can't be unburnt, as they can with a sidechain using a peg.


This is not how it works. Take colored coins for example, you can have a red bitcoin that represents more than the value of 1 bitcoin.

If your language natively supports fixed point then you are right. If it doesn't (which is probably the case) then a very large floating point used to represent a comparatively small number works just as well.
There are virtually no precision issues when using 64 bit floats to represent a bitcoin (which is a very small value compared to what a 64 bit float can represent).

Easiest = 0 hours.
Hardest = millions of hours.
You suggest OP's challenge takes 2 hours. Even if you use a log chart for this, this is still very easy.
What I mean is, in the big scheme of hacking/cracking challenges, 2 hours is not hard.
Also time consumed does not necessarily equate to difficulty. Something can be easy to do but time consuming to complete.
Figuring out how to solve OP's problem efficiently only took a few minutes. Carrying out the implementation takes longer sure, but that is not really the hard part of this, since the tools mostly exist for you already.
But sure, we can define this to be medium if you want, it's all just semantics at this point.

It's not time consuming or costly. It's just that the *chance* of getting the small reward doesn't justify the costs+risk.

No, I wouldn't say that. It might make it less profitable, or more, that's not clear.
If LN is not used at all because we have 0.01 MB blocks then what's the "profitability" of LN. Whatever "profitable" means for LN. Profit for who?
It makes it more valuable to Bitcoin users, because the demand for transactions off chain increases as the block size decreases.
If the block size is 1000000 MB then the demand for transactions outside of blocks is very low, because it's cheap and easy to put a transaction in a block.
If the block size is 0.01 MB then the demand for putting blocks off-chain is very high because we can't fit transactions into blocks unless you pay a lot.
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:27:22

"Easy" is spending two hours.

You should be telling that to the person I was replying to, as he is the one who believes you can be on both chains at the same time.
That said, I could create conflicting transactions between my own addresses on both chains until my coins ended up at two different addresses on BTC and BTX. At that point I could then use my coins independently on both chains.
@_date: 2015-08-05 04:32:24
Most bitcoin services out there (exchanges for example) pool user coins together.
Even if the coins are clearly separate and belong to you, if you meet with some LBC user and buy coins from him, are you going to trace his coins to see if they are stolen? How many users will do that? Even if you do this, you don't know his identity and you can't see how many of those coins he deposits in the future into other LBC accounts.
Clearly only LBC admins have far more ability to trace things here and do something about it.
If you meet some guy, and the coins aren't mixed, and you see that he sells you $5000 of stolen coins, what are you going to do? What were you even suggesting? That people kill some LBC user over $5000 coins that *maybe* he stole? Post pictures of him? What?

Well there are constantly issues to vote on.
You either vote on all of them, vote on some of them, or give your vote to someone who is informed, or let someone informed vote for you for some issues while you specifically vote on others. There are a lot of possibilities.
So you don't necessarily need to be informed. Or you can be. You can take the time to select someone to give your votes to (like an elections process) or  not. It is a continuous process and not a scheduled big elections event so I'd say it is rather different, especially since it is 100% optional.

It is pretty easy.
It's just that 0.25 BTC reward does not compensate the time of doing it and also the risk of all the penalties (ISP complains, you get put on a list of people that are seen doing mass port scanning, etc).
Not to mention that if someone else beats you to it then you don't even get the 0.25 BTC reward. And since this is easy to do, I assume someone else (who is probably already set up to do this) is about to get the reward so I'm not going to bother.

As in, it won't bother us if you sell your 5 bitcoins.
But anyway, think about it. The fact that bitcoin is lacking in several areas is the main reason why the price is low, and the main reason why there is an opportunity to profit from a rise in price (because those lacking areas will eventually improve).
In other words if bitcoin already had all the amazing features that are discussed, then the price wouldn't be low and there wouldn't be a buying opportunity.
If you don't think those features will ever get developed, then OK, sell your coins. I would prefer that you do, because I would rather that people who are holding coins later are people that understood and believed in this technology and ecosystem.

^^ See &gt; How would they spend at the same time if they are forked?
See comment.
A transaction on BTC can often (subject to some conditions) be used to spend the same coins on BTX. So anyone can just rebroadcast your transaction from BTC to BTX to move your coins in the same way as you did on BTC.
In other words a transaction that says "Spend from address A to address B" on BTC is going to also work on BTX because the addresses are going to be also valid and address A exists on both chains. BTX doesn't change *that* many rules so most transactions will be compatible.

Computer scientist here too!
They are bad when you represent large numbers using floats that are too small (so most applications in the past using only 32 bit floats).
However, in specifically the case where you are using 64 bit floats to represent bitcoins (which only have 8 places used on either side of the decimal point), you do not have precision problems and using floats for financial quantities does not cause any issues. 
If you round your 64 bit floating point final result to 8 decimals then there will be zero difference, no loss of precision.
To illustrate this, consider if you used 32 bit floats to only ever represent numbers between -0.9 to 0.9. You would never have floating point error after rounding, unless you construct a really ridiculous loop that accumulates error for a really long time, with no consideration for what your code does.
@_date: 2015-08-14 02:24:04


There are almost zero gotchas. You can use them normally and do any operations in any order, if you are using 64 bit floats to represent bitcoins.

Actually all blocks are not completely full yet. Many blocks are full during the busy times of the day, but transactions still get through in ~8 hours max because the less busy time of the day eventually comes and blocks have some room in them for low fee transactions.
When blocks are full all day every day, that is when you can indisputably say "blocks are full".

Hash power was much lower back then, and each miner had a larger amount of coins coming in relative to their investment.
If the bitcoin price rose to $10000 tomorrow, and miners bought equipment because of the resulting increase in mining profitability, then the price falling to $1000 would cause all of the miners that bought that new equipment to lose money. But your argument would try to say "well mining was profitable at $400 so it shouldn't matter if the price has fallen!".
So you can see how that argument fails.

- First of all, lists banning certains coins in bitcoin have been implemented in the past. See luke dashjr's version of bitcoind/bitcoin-qt, which had blacklists turned on by default to filter satoshidice and other transactions from being relayed at all.
- Second, any bitcoin client could implement a blacklist. This would be "blacklists within Bitcoin".
- Third, the fact that it is possible for "3rd parties" (AKA a company with a bitcoin client) to create blacklists means that governments could *mandate* blacklists. If you go to starbucks to buy a coffee and they won't take your coins because they use blacklists then what? Fungibility is destroyed. Your concept of "3rd parties" is silly.
- Fourth, if bitcoin had better privacy options then worrying about dealing with 3rd parties would not be such a problem.
- Fifth, privacy options in bitcoin are coming whether you want them or not. They are important for more than just fungibility issues.

Big companies buy small companies, companies consolidate over and over until there are very few companies.
There are many cases where the government comes in and forces competition, for example in Canada, big ISPs are forced to sell service to reseller companies.

Your transaction for 0.032 BTC went through and confirmed, and now either you or the receiver is confused because they also see the other irrelevant unconfirmed transaction and they think it is relevant.

The idea is that you are choosing to join your message to a group of other messages.
Others could then for example view a stream of messages that include that hashtag, like participating in a chat room by specifying the tag only.
Of course, they have been abused and often aren't used that way, but the point is that a search bar doesn't achieve the same thing.

The point of hashtags are to make things searchable, whether you use them as part of a sentence or not is irrelevant.
That said, hashtags don't work on reddit so this really is stupid.

If there are blacklisted coins then black coins are not the same as white coins thus all coins are not fungible, by the definition of fungibility.

Of course it is a store of value. When it is not being used for payment it is being used to store value.
It is just not a very good store of value compared to alternatives.

No one here is talking about the total transaction cost of a bitcoin transfer except for you.
The thread exists because it is unusual for JoinMarket to have such a large liquidity provider at such a low fee.
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:51:41
No, you really do not get it. We all know that bitcoin transaction fees are subsidized by block rewards. We aren't discussing bitcoin transaction fees or block reward subsidies in this thread.
This thread is not about bitcoin transaction fees. It is about the fee paid for coinjoin mixing services.
When the OP mentions the "$0.95 fee", he is not talking about a fee paid to miners, it's a fee for a coinjoin mixing service, and it does not include the transaction fees or block subsidies (which can be $100 for all that it matters to this thread).
Normally one expects to pay $100 to mix 900 BTC with joinmarket. Today you can pay $1 to mix 900 BTC.
Now you come in here and say "OMG but the bitcoin transaction fee and block subsidy must also be paid so you're actually paying $5!!!" Uh, ya, so what? Previously you'd be paying $100 (and still couldn't even mix 900 BTC anyway) so OP made this thread about it.
I'm not even going to address the argument that block reward subsidies are paid only by those who send (as opposed to all other market participants, such as buyers of coins and holders of coins), because even if you're 100% right it still makes absolutely no difference to this thread which is about the relative fees of joinmarket coinjoins.

The fee that is the subject of this thread is separate from bitcoin network transaction costs.
The fee in question is the amount you pay to a 3rd party for the service of mixing your coins with theirs.

You have had a good experience, but that doesn't mean everyone else has the same experience all of the time.
Transactions get priority based on age of coins and size.
If you are sending a transaction that has few inputs (your transaction is not many bytes) then a small fee works fine.
But having say 1% of the transactions get stuck (6+ hour waits) during high network load times is a big problem. 0% should get stuck in this way.

I wrote it that way "To get the idea" of the concept of "efficiency" in this sense.
Take 100000 random bitcoin buy times instead then, and compare the DCA and DVA and lump sump strategies had you bought at any of those times.
You will find that DVA and lump sum yield higher returns on average.
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:56:20
I'm not trying to sell anything, especially to an audience of 1 redditor. The papers (or a cursory web search) explain how DVA works. Keep using DCA if you prefer it.

There was also a warning a while back from the mycelium devs saying that while they have long term privacy goals, right now they can see all your transactions.
You should definitely assume they are seeing your transactions.
Transaction data in this app is not from the blockchain, it is from mycelium servers which monitor the blockchain (kind of like what Electrum does).

If you have dollar denominated debts then buying bitcoins (which have a very volatile price) is far riskier than buying a -0.01% interest bond. So they don't really have that option for *ALL* of their cash.

They are wrong. The poll asked "What Bitcoin Will Be Trading At Within The Next 12 Months"
That was asked in February of 2014.
@_date: 2016-07-13 05:42:58
A technically "mathy" way of putting it:


To get the idea, for example take 100 random stocks and pick a random time for each of them to start investing in. Lump sum (or DVA) investing in all of them would overall yield a better return than DCA investing in all of them. Because DCA is not "efficient" -- it is a plan than statistically will generate a lower return than other strategies all things being equal. This might be counterintuitive (it was for me) but there are many papers proving this (including the one I linked), if you want to search for them.
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:25:04


So does Bitfinex that the OP references. (They use BitGo's system for this.)
@_date: 2016-07-16 03:31:49
All of these people were asked what the price would be after it just shot up from $100 to $1000.
It would be like if the price went up from $400 a month ago to $4000 two months from now and then taking a poll. You could maybe compare the new poll at the $4000 price point to the poll you just linked.


It did go up that time, by a factor of 10.
The linked poll is not very comparable to the state of things today, and you don't even have a poll today to compare to (so who are "so many" people that you are referring to anyway?). 
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:12:13
Your question doesn't make sense.
It is known that DCA is inefficient so why use it when you can just use DVA (or something else) in its place? By "it is known" I mean it is rigidly mathematically proven to be. It is random for ***any*** market price, including bitcoin or anything else that behaves like a random walk.
You can't know how much DCA will be worse than DVA because you don't know what the future price of bitcoin will be.
Here's another paper studying the difference in particular between DVA and DCA:
@_date: 2016-07-13 05:47:37
I mostly agree although I think many in the bitcoin community would put in the extra little effort to do DVA if they understood that it is more efficient. It would also probably result in a less volatile BTC price if everyone did this.


IMO, only slightly more. "I want to have $5000 of bitcoins by the end of this year." Assuming you have enough money (flexibility of budget if the price continously falls) for the DVA strategy for this, and know how many BTC you have at any given time, then planning is now done.
@_date: 2016-07-12 20:00:51
Actually from a purely mathematical and probability based view, lump sum is more efficient than dollar cost averaging.
On the other hand, *dollar value averaging* (not DCA) and lump sum are both equal efficiency.
@_date: 2016-07-16 03:37:37


*Start* times of the strategy can begin at any time.
The expected return of DCA is lower than the expected return of DVA.
My "random times" example is to try to give a notion of [expected value]( and the probability side of things here, for the layman.


There are dozens of whitepapers giving in depth rigid mathematical analysis proving that DCA is suboptimal, and I linked one for you.
@_date: 2016-07-16 17:40:47
Just read page 3 of the paper I just linked for you. It gives concrete numbers.
Or do you actually expect me to code up the same analysis they did except for bitcoin just so that I can report the same findings, even though this would provide no useful data even since we can't predict the future price anyway?
As you can see on page 3, both a rising market (which bitcoin is in the long run, historically) and a fluctuating market (which bitcoin often is in the short run) make DVA significantly more efficient.
All we really know for certain is that probabilistically DVA will generate a better return than DCA, so why do we need to do further research? Or do you think that the bitcoin price is magically special and math doesn't apply to it because bitcoin "is not a stock"?


It is the claim of numerous papers and mathematicians. I have already linked you two white papers that go into great detail and [I quoted clear terms]( explaining that it is mathematically proven that DCA is less efficient than DVA.
If you don't understand probability or statistics then this is a major barrier to explanation, and I can't help you further at this time. If you understand even the basics then the paper linked makes things pretty clear.

@_date: 2016-07-19 21:06:04
Consider someone (a large organization, investment bank, etc) who needs to hold dollars as they have dollar denominated obligations to clients/investors.
If they want minimum risk, what other choice do they have?
They can't hold a billion dollars in physical cash and even if they could, for them holding physical cash is more risky (and therefore more expensive) than holding numbers in a computer database at -0.009% interest.
They feel that holding dollars in a different computer database somewhere (like a bank) is more risky -- if the bank fails they lose their money after all.
At the end of the day there is no such thing as holding risk free dollars and they want minimum risk so this is the least risky option they have.
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:12:25
If you have CAD denominated debt then that is riskier than buying -0.01% bonds due to USDCAD volatility.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:06:56
The short answer is that some organizations don't have any other choice without taking on additional risk.
