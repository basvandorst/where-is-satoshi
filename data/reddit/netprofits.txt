"So what is the best practices for online wallets?"
Use 2FA/ OTP whenever possible.  Only use online wallets for short-term storage and either paper or local wallets for long-term BTC data stored locally.  Trust yourself with your BTC security more than you do any site online.

Any leveraged or debt-based investment will do one of two things:
1)  Make you more money than you ever thought possible from the initial investment....or
2) be one of the worse investment decisions you ever made.

Sadly, ouroimports, there is only pain in moving your money from Mt. Gox.  I have some funds there as well and here are the two quickest and operational withdraw methods I know of currently:
1)  Cash out your position in BTC and transfer them out of Gox immediately.  You can then use Bitstamp, BTC-e, or another exchange if you choose and take a one-time loss of 10% or so on your investment.  This site will give you an idea of pricing elsewhere:  
2)  Cash out your position in BTC and transfer them out of Gox immediately.  Establish an account on localbitcoins.com and learn how to sell your BTC online to other people looking to buy.  The smaller your inventory or the greater your efforts, the more likely you are to sell closer to your transfer price from Gox, thus reducing your losses.
Good luck and I hope this helps!

Strange.  Android here also and I actually enabled it today on localbitcoins after I read your post.  Are you doing it manually or scanning the image?  Personally, I scanned it with my HTC phone.

Good to know, Olaf.  What makes the issue(s) correctable at this point?  This is not the first time this has occurred, correct?  Thanks.

Oh stop...

The first comment answered this.  No.  You cannot send USD from Gox to BS.

They are @ 0.8.5 so I suggest staying updated.  There were issues with 0.8.3 and the blockchain as I recall.  
Backup.  Backup again somewhere else.  Upgrade.  You should be fine.

You could scribe it on my bald head.   :P

Bitcoin-qt is @ version 0.8.5 so I suggest staying updated. There were issues with previous versions and the blockchain as I recall.  Backup. Backup again somewhere else. Upgrade. You should be fine.

Hello!  If you are using Windows 7, click on the clock along the task bar, chose "change date and time settings.  Click on "Internet time", then "change settings".  This will allow you to choose from several clocks available and click on "update".   
There are also a number of atomic clock or time synchronization programs which ALWAYS maintain the correct time on your device without going through the above.  :)

Really?  The home page states:  
No activity logs.
No speed limit.
Virtually unlimited traffic (1TB/mo.).
EDIT:  The FAQ's also clearly state they do not retain surfing info nor your connecting IP address beyond 24hrs.

Why you shouldn't use Google Voice to receive verification codes.  I just read about this and hope this helps:

Sure.  Only invest $2500 and net over 20X your investment in a year.  If this does not sound unbelievable, I will sell you ASIC units all day long or until you are bankrupt.

Or a court order.  A wallet's transaction history will surely lead even the newest investigator in directions you may not want them to go.  A person does not have to be in the act of hiding anything but simply chooses not to be identified or tracked by others.  You do lock the doors of your home and or car, correct?  What things "are you hiding?"

"Conclusion: Either Fenix is severely undervalued, AM is severely overvalued, or people expect dividend payout from AM to increase drastically."
Or alternatively, all of your calculations are incorrect.

Be sure to synchronize the clocks with a time server on all devices you may use. If everything else functions as it should and you have previously and successfully accessed Localbitcoins using 2FA, this is usually the issue.   
Note I used 2FA multiple times and on several different sites yesterday without incident.  Good luck!

digitalh3rmit:  I enabled 2FA in about 15 seconds on localbitcoins using GA.
