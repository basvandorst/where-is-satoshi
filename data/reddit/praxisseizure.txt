Actually glass is an amorphous solid. It doesn't flow.

Spice pirates :D
Speaking of spices, I just made a mean saffron chicken / rice shebang and it's hurting my life. :P

People who call it Mount Gox especially msm drive me hysterical.
To think a trading card exchange would 'akira' metastasize in such a way. Quite remarkable.

Without speculation, the price would be a function of velocity (speed changing hands) which ebbs and flows based on season, fad, any number of factors. Price won't reflect stable value unless the gaps in 'normalcy' are eaten up by speculators which results in stability.
This really only works over the long term though. As it stands today, speculators *are* the market so 'normal' doesn't apply yet. The market cap isn't high enough. Infancy is very volatile. Manipulation is easy now and so it will be for some time until the market really builds out to the point that everyone (critical mass) can use it for commerce easily.

This should be normal. Since the BTC market is totally free and unencumbered, there will be hugely wild swings while the market cap is easily kicked around by deep pockets.
Remember, anyone can play, even the big boys. 
It'll stabilize over time but in the meantime it will stay a roller coaster.
Best to just buy steadily (over months) and use in commerce. Avoid chasing bubbles. There will be tons of them. Cash out (some, not all) on a top if you want to take speculative profits but don't bank on it being predictable.
It's only investment value is the expansion of commerce via the currency. (which has a lot of potential and is growing steadily) Otherwise, it's just another currency. Damn cool one at that.

Wisdom is the result of observance, patience and prudence through turmoil.

Indeed. Though availability criteria isn't necessary. Local currencies aren't available on another continent, let alone nation or state or town even. 
Reciprocally, not all commodities are found everywhere.

I agree entirely. But those are manipulated markets and they try to justify manipulation as if it were speculation (usually with non-public information).  That's the criminal stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:46:10
I can't see it as an investment other than those who are expanding the BTC access base. Those are the investments. BTC is unique (other v-currencies modeled on it accepted). It's a financial system in and of itself. That's awesome despite all the pitfalls BTC users need to learn, experience, recover from. :D.. It's almost like reinventing the wheel but better.
Outside that, it's just a cool currency. It'll do its own thing and very likely appreciate over time.  (not like this current mania)
It's only the infrastructure that's lacking and holding it down. That's certainly understandable. The future is awesome for competing v-currencies.

Oh fair enough.

Bull trap :D

Don't get ahead of yourself, OP.
It's entirely possible BTC/USD will bounce down.
Cheering now is premature.
(I am not selling btw)

Welcome to the real world; where your actions are permanent and the consequences your own.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:08
Speculation reducing risk is great!  It does have side effects such as irrational exuberance bubbles when they get ahead of themselves but overall, healthy speculation will prevent BTC from hitting zero and help greatly in price discovery long term.
In the long run it'll even out the wild swings in price when people can play both sides of the BTC/USD trade. Currently there is not yet an option to short BTC. When that's available, things will even out quite a bit. Of course, not for a while. These things take time and always go through a period of high volatility.
edit: the only problem with BTC is it's so open that it's extremely vulnerable to pump &amp; dumps. The bigger the market cap, the more USD it will take to foist such a scam on the BTC network and the riskier / less profitable it gets. This also applies to BTC users wising up. The wiser they are, the less effective pump &amp; dumps will be.

I hate to say it but if you don't know how finance works you're missing a crucial part of basic education...  which they don't but should teach in fricken grade school.
There would be a lot less fraud in the world if everyone knew how money-value-currency and trade relates to each other.
I wasn't taught either. It's tricky when you're stabbing in the dark trying to understand it but eventually with enough information and personal analysis (common sense), anyone can figure it out.
A huge part of it is psychology. I mean lol..  what is a US dollar but faith? It used to be pinned to the supply of gold and previous to that gold and silver. The nuances are endless, but with a non-emotional, non-dogmatic perspective, it all makes sense. Debt, credit all of it are understandable if you do due diligence outside the ridiculous conditioning we (in the US) received in grade school and beyond.

This is true and cannot be ignored. Eventually it'll bite.
If people trading in BTC are astute to these dangers then they can be quickly mitigated. It depends on the vigilant community really to ferret out fraud and it'll take a lot more effort than judging the practices of a few exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:31:11
Commodities *are* currencies. It's only the central dogma (banks) forcing their navel lint into solution who say otherwise, reverse osmosing into spongy skulls.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:08:29
Wait. It's an investment but it's really a simple financial system in and of itself but it's a means of exchange as well but it's not a currency.
While I don't disagree, many aspects of whatever the f* cryptocurrencies are is entirely ignored in your argument.
Maybe it should be called an abomination, or shub niggurath.

Any new currency will go through growing pangs. Just like an IPO does but on steriods x10. Weather the infancy. The ultimate goal is a wide and deep market where we can buy stuff. There are already some incredible deals only available in BTC. 
Continue, continue Commerce.
Speculators only solidify the base and follow the trends.  
It's the real world goods / services which will take BTC from the internet to your dinner table / living room / recreation.
Manipulators will be ever present. It's inevitable if you want a truly free market. Note them and be aware of their contribution to the network. The wiser you are to their games, the less they will bother you. Don't fall prey to their charms lol. Emotion is silly stuff. 
When it comes to the rocks and salts of the real world, chisel and grind. The long slog will be worth it. Freedom of transaction is worth it.
