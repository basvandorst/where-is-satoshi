dollar will go on as long as the United States exists, which is indefinitely. Again, it would take an asteroid or global war for that to happen, and neither are likely.

can we seriously stop with this shit. This apocalyptic level stuff here. If we ever got to the point of a mass exodus of people from fiat, were either in some jetsons level future or the world is about to end. The fact of the matter is government fiat isn't going to be collapsing anytime soon and this "dollar is going to collapse man" bullshit type of talk is not helpful to bitcoin. It just makes us sound like irrational hardcore libertarians who have been saying this type of crap forever.

what can you buy with bitcoin in your daily life? Oh you can buy that computer on newegg lmao. Come on man. Does your local supermarket accept bitcoin and even if they did, would you use it? I sure as hell wouldn't at this stage. Depending on their policy, you'd have to wait 10 minutes for at least one confirmation and that's if the mempool isn't congested. I can just swipe my credit card in an instant and be protected by the credit card company of any fraudulent charges. You ever pay with bitcoin at a restaurant? You pay any of your bills in bitcoin? I have all my bills paid automatically with my bank account. There is no real use for bitcoin in you daily life. How is that talking shit? I mean seriously, how many businesses that you come across in your daily life accept bitcoin as a payment option?

yeah, that's what I thought. Another cheerleader who could give two shits about the actual tech. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:49:36
yeah I fucked up. Where am I getting 300,000 from? That is probably the amount of people that own a considerable amount of bitcoin. Regardless, I would guess most of the bitcoin is held by not that many people. Is that 10 million coinbase number active accounts that hold any amount of bitcoin? I would imagine there's plenty of inactive accounts.

wait so I have to sign up for a bitcoin debit card, when I already have a debit card and a credit card that works just fine. And the speculative volatility in bitcoin value makes it really dumb to actually spend bitcoin, when it's value can skyrocket or decline in a matter of minutes and hours. Doesn't Gyft take a percentage off the top? Why would I do that when I could just buy $500 worth of gift cards for face value with fiat. Spendabit? yeah another awesome signup process middleman. I have not once ordered anything from overstock. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:29:26
and how does bitcoin solve this? If I remember correctly, I read that there are only around 300,000 people in the world that own any amount of bitcoin. And a handful of individuals own a large share of the existing bitcoin.

calm your tits dude lol. I'll just say I'm committed to bitcoin. I'm not here to humble brag like you lol "down payment on a Tesla." The cringe is strong in this one. 
Daily life as in you walk down the street and pass a bunch of small businesses. You know coffee shops, pizzerias, barbers, etc. How many businesses do you come across that accept bitcoin? Tough for brick and mortar to accept bitcoin for obvious reasons, but internet retailers should be all in on bitcoin payments, but nope. Overall, how many internet retailers accept bitcoin? 
Oh right, Gyft works like purse. Nice business model. And if you think bitcoin went from $100 to $4000 based on tech and not speculative fever, you have a lot to learn. I can admit I simply got lucky getting into bitcoin early. I advise you to do the same and show some humility. It is not worth it's current value with where the tech is right now, especially in the face of competing blockchain technologies. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:55:00
this is true. Of course you can find merchants that accept bitcoin payments, but overall, there are not than many that do. And even those merchants that do accept bitcoin, there is no real benefit in using bitcoin over fiat, especially when bitcoin's value has been increasing. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:08:50
enlighten me on the efforts they are making on scaling bitcoin to match those in the fiat world - banks, payment processors, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:19:40
I'm well aware of the efforts. I want you to explain it to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:16:57
mises lol. They've been bloviating the fiat collapse narrative since its inception. Let me guess, we need to go back to the gold standard asap.....
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:48:06
what is crazy about having faith in USD? Were living it right now. The world runs on the dollar dude lmao. I have USD in my wallet right now and in my bank account. I pay all my bills with it. BTC at the moment is nothing more than potential right now and it's value is mostly speculative. I can't buy anything with it. It's only real utility at the moment is a store of value and moving money P2P. And even on the P2P side, it is far from handling huge amounts of transactions. I have much more faith in the blockchain technology, than I do bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:46:11
showing concern about bitcoin scalability is trolling. Fantastic
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:43:37
enlighten me my friend. I really am curious what you doomsday people actually think could possibly happen that would lead to the collapse of the dollar or the fiat of any stable nation. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:37:42
that's pretty much my reaction waiting for core devs to even pretend to give a shit about bitcoin scalability. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:23:47
yeah when hell freezes over
