I can speak Japanese, but only as a Brown dude.

Haha this is great and also why I fear what I would sound like if I did talk to people about bitcoin. Btw was this filmed in Austin? I saw what looked like 6th st and Chuggin Monkey.

Yeah I was confused and thought it would be like a contest who gets the most correct pics against other users (like the March Madness tourny) which is why I thought they capped it to 5000 entries, but I guess that's to prevent 1 person doings hundreds of entries.

The first email I got from them said it was capped at 5000, though the subsequent emails didn't mention this and I see on the website that its now limited to 1 entry per person/IP address so they probably changed it.

Oh wow didn't know Negreanu was into BTC. Is there a link to his blog?

Just hoping to see the DBZ Vegeta over 9000 meme not too long from now.

I'm just patiently waiting for the freeza memes

Man I didn't think we would be talking about seeing Vegeta so soon, but its definitely a possibility we could see him bust his scouter before year's end!

Everyone is waiting for Vegeta but I wanna see Frieza. Power level = 1 million.  
Forget the moon, forget Mars. I wanna head to planet Namek.

Dell typically abandons any ship they don't understand, mp3 players, phones, tablet/laptop combos so not surprised they got rid of the bitcoin option.

If you build it, they will come! Love the philosophy, I hate trying to sell someone on something or being sold. If you build up a good rep and have a solid business then you will succeed.

I deposited funds via the cash deposit method on Bitinstant, printed the info, went to Wal-mart and filled out the moneygram and by the time I got home my funds were in my Mt. Gox account less the fees, probably a span of about 20 minutes.
What method did you use to deposit?

Guys even if bitcoinbillionaire wanted to tip anymore, the bittipper bot is down...so let him just chill :D

Awesome, I'm also in Austin and recently got into bitcoin too after the recent hype even though I knew about it beforehand but didn't look into investing at the time as I didn't have a computer worth mining with and I didn't even know about the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:15:46
I used bitinstant to deposit money into Mt. Gox also via Wal-mart moneygram. It was fast and simple. This was my first time actually buying/owning bitcoins. 
I've heard about it in the past but it seemed too difficult and expensive to mine but once the value skyrocketed that is when I found out about the exchanges.

1. Promise to build an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to mine bitcoins at far better rates than GPU for the masses 
2. Raise capital/ take "pre-orders"
3. Mine with customers ASICS
4. ???
5. Profit
