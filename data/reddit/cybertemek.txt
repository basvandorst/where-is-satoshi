Copied from the Internet:"•	You are not really investing, you are mostly gambling. Some of these companies will likely fail to deliver a product. Maybe they never even intended to produce one.
•	Do not rush.
•	Don't be greedy.
•	Do not ask: "What is the best ICO at the moment". Or do it if you want to create a potential non-investment list. Do your homework first.
•	Be a "sane paranoïd". People are not always what they pretend to be and scammers are gifted to seduce.
•	Due diligence is the key. You cannot just rely on other people comments, thoughts or so called "analysis". The interests of others are not necessarily yours.
•	Invest only what you can afford to lose.
•	Invest in something you do understand. You have to deep dive into the product: who, what, when, how? What about technology, team, market, viability, roadmap, token, supply, market cap, distribution, incentives, etc.
•	Does the product really need to be based on blockchain technology?
•	Is there a market?
•	Ask for informations. Ask again. And again. Exemple.
•	Do they have a product, github, etc?
•	What about the token? Necessary? Useful? What's the use? What about the incentives to use, hold or sell it? Is there a way to sell it?
•	Access to ICO smart contract's code before the ICO? Audited? Terms of ICO / Presale? Website audited?
•	As a token holder, what do you gain?
•	In your country, what are the legal and tax implications as a token buyer/holder/seller?
•	Think about it for a minute: the company is successful and Google buy it. What happens to your investment?
•	There is no free money. If the project sounds too good to be true, just go back to "sane paranoïd" mode and take a closer look.
•	Check accounts on reddit (history, karma, redditor since, write to who and in which subreddits).
•	Caution with pyramid / ponzi schemes. How to spot them? 1) Most of the time, guaranteed return on investment. 2) Aberrant interest rates (no one can give you 1% daily, nor 10% monthly. I know you would like it, but be realistic).
•	A lot of ICO rating/due diligence services, forums and websites are in a potential conflict of interests. If the service accept donation: caution. If a company has to pay to be rated or is encouraged to make a donation to expedite the procedure: caution. If the service shill the iCO: caution. If the rating service is also acting as an exchange, intermediary, consultant: caution. Just four examples: IcoBazaar.com, Icodrops.com, Icobench.com and even r/icocrypto which accept donation to support moderation.
•	Spread the awarness.

After the SegWit , Lightning  can dramatically scale the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:23:18
Bitcoin is more of an asset and/or trusted fund than a payment method.Bitcoin payments can take on average minutes to hours and there is no complete mechanism for handling fraud or ensuring customer satisfaction.The blockchain by design is a low level protocol that never intended to directly solve all the matters in payments and, rather humbly provides the foundation upon which many features of the traditional financial system can be rebuilt. For blockchain technology to truly propagate to the payment space, services like credit and mediation must eventually be included.

 Of course there will be big corrections on the way,  but 10 years from now, I won't be surprised if 1 BTC will stand on $250K.

There is no regulation on it so it is not illegal,but as has already been said,it is immoral,not fair and very close to theft.I personally thin that cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges can only benefit from greater regulation.By establishing a proper regulatory framework, government agencies could help reduce the uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, driving more robust investment.
Carefully designed regulation could help eliminate some of the uncertainty surrounding digital currencies, potentially enticing a wider range of investors — including both individuals and institutions — to get involved with these assets.

I just wanted to say the same as Sbakefeet101 - if he does not really understands Bitcoin,how come he or she writes anything about the subject?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:30:35
Bitcoin's asset-like quality (its appreciation in value) is one of the main things limiting its adoption in payments. People want to HODL rather than spend. Complexity for consumers/merchants, slow settlement times and high fees don't help. Fewer merchants accept Bitcoin in 2017 than did in 2016.
But 20 years from now, it's hard to believe we'll be paying for coffee using anything other than cryptocurrencies. Something will adapt or emerge to take on this role. The open question is: will Bitcoin adapt to better handle typical payments use cases (like buying a cup of coffee) or will an altcoin achieve widespread adoption in payments first?
