I feel ya on all of that. I had major second thoughts about posting what I posted because I know everyone here is excited and happy and I didn't wanna be that guy. I think that even if I was holding the 20 I'd still have this feeling that shit is about to go down hill in a hurry! I'd probably be looking at secluded property and bunker construction.. I got Ron Paul Circa 2009 ringing in my ear talking about how they're just kicking it down the road and I feel like the intersection is right around the corner.. I hope I'm wrong and the transition to bitcoin is peaceful and pleasant for everyone some how... Like I said, I'm happy for everyone, I honestly am. But this happening as quickly as it is is fuckin scary!

I'm walking friend. Enjoy yourself! I hope it doesn't stop!

Yeah I'll definitely keep my options open keeping in mind how myspace and facebook went down

How old are you? Not being a shithead, serious question
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:26:04
Don't give me too much credit, credit is the reason I'm not in the best shape now lol.. No, I'm not in terrible shape. Just made some shitty decisions lately. Nothing I can't dig my way out of

Yeah, I had a feeling I was wrong. Idk where I got 170m from, thanks..

I can't say that I would have done the same. I was prepared to put 5k on it back then cause I was a believer, and I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination.. Hell, I still think its a good investment now! I kick myself for not being smarter.. Hopefully I'll scoop up one or two before it gets up to 100/200k

Doesn't necessarily have to be btc. I can definitely see something else coming along to take its place. That said, I still see btc going way higher than it is now.. Just my own opinion though

Actually, you're right. It is a shitty lesson to learn. And I won't apologize to anybody for learning it. Its rarely ever worth it, believe me

Wasn't bills for me. It was helping people that I shouldn't have. "Friends" are cheap until they need something.. I don't blame them though, it was my decision to make and I made it.. It'll never happen again though..

Because there are only 170 million to be mined (if I remember correctly) spread that out across the whole planet if it becomes the worlds standard currency and holding 1~100 would make you pretty rich! *All speculation of course* 
*Also if inflation happens to the dollar it will kind of meet itself in the middle somewhere. The dollar will be worth less.. Hard to think of a loaf of bread costing a thousand dollars but it's happened before and we're heading in that direction..

Believe me, I'd love to have at least one! But money is tight right now.. I'll get there as soon as I can though.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:34:46
Good for you! It's something at least! Hold on to that though! I believe it's gonna blast off once people realize how bad the fed has been fucking people all these years! Once the dollar takes a shit, anybody who knows anything about decentralized currency is gonna want btc, and theres only so much to go around.. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:25:49
I know, but I can't justify it until my other debts are paid.. Just scraping by at the moment.. I'll get there, (hopefully) staying optimistic!
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:28:47
It doesn't, now I just feel bad for you too lol.. You still holding some at least? Cause that would make me feel better..
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:14:00
Man this makes me sick to my stomach.. I had the chance to buy 20 back when they were $250 each but I choose to help 2 "friends" out.. We're not even friends anymore and im salty.. Lesson learned I guess..
