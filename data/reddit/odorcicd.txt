I just recently tried out [Anycoin Direct]( (purchased using INTERAC online) without issues, since they just recently opened up to allowing Canadians to buy. If you're looking to buy bigger amounts in a [reasonable amount of time]( you'll have to provide identification.
They don't support selling yet, though.

What needs to be more seamless on Shopify's end?

Okay, give it another go!

Take a look at 'Alternative Payment Methods' in the Checkout &amp; Payment settings. Bitcoins can be accepted alongside credit cards now.

It was released today, so there hasn't even been an announcement as of yet. Test it out and let us know if it works as expected?

Noticed some redditors were asking for a list of all merchants that accepted Bitcoins on Shopify. They released a blog post with some here.

It'll be fixed within the hour, they'll both be able to run at the same time. I'll let you know in a bit when you can try again.
