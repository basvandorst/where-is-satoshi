Even if it weren't voluntary, if it were so lucrative to mine and charge transaction fees, more mining hubs would sprout and lower the price to market levels. Hurray 0 barrier to entry.

Very cool. I don't think there's anything to trade based off though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:48:45
Genius. Great insight into deflationary marketing.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:25:19
 I was just looking at that. I was trying to compare it to BitPay. I'm not sure which one is better at the moment. I know for sure BitPay seems smaller.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:46:24
As far as I'm concerned, it's highly-evadable income that has zero transaction cost and no liability for merchants. Why do you need to see the biggest online corporate tools fouling up Bitcoin?
I think your pessimism is largely unfounded. EVERY business should accept Bitcoin.

A situation without network access or electricity favors gold.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:54:17
Bitcoin proper is a backend. What we really need is a network of payment processors and private banks to make its use seamless.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:00:23
A dog on acid would have this reaction.
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:00:54
If BTC were worth $1000 USD tomorrow and persisted, wouldn't that make you buy a mining rig just to join a pool and earn back the rig in a week?
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:54:23
Holy crap, thanks! I have no idea how to collect that, haha.
EDIT: I learned how to read! Found the guide, thank you so much! And yep, I'm checking out now. Seems like a lot of me's are there.

As a kid, I know that I couldn't spend any money online because, well, I was a kid. Maybe you'd get a few cents for doing chores or something, but how could you actually make that count? It's the low-transaction cost of things like Bitcoin that truly make it amazing. Imagine the difference between asking 1,000 people for $20 and asking 100,000 for 25 cents. I think that this is how the information economy will work in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:18:59
Does anyone else find buzz like this almost maddeningly exciting? I love this shit.
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:41:25
"and attractive to those looking for a way to launder money"
I missed how that was relevant to Bitcoin not having value...
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:59:24
Good enough reasons for me!
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:39:34
Gave you an up, but damn dude, to accidentally as a verb hurts during the read.
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:58:48
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:20:25
I'd love to figure out how to take this concept and turn it into a "Like" button type of thing that could be incorporated wherever the other likes and shares are. Is there anything like this current available?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:00:01
Is it a chargeback issue that has you rejecting PayPal?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:28:15
Mandatory encryption, but this must be at the file system layer? Meaning only iOS integrated actions can use it? When you jailbreak, you can use third party disk managers. How is it encrypted?
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:57:50
Right, but wouldn't the USD incentive to mine BTC increase as the exchange rate ran away?
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:37:35
You sold when you started losing money? You have to throw your emotion out. There's gambling and there's investing. Two different things.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:49:06
Love this story.
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:51:15
Cool response from that guy. He seemed interested but distracted by his shitty day job.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:32:51
I hear you. I think you've hit the nail on the head. But let's talk about media coverage. That's what's really fueling this. No one is talking about lite or any other alternative. As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin has entered the age of the currency wars. All this competition will drive healthy innovation. That's GOOD.
We want people to constantly have to evaluate their use of fiat currencies. Also, you feel a lot less "free" when you start seeing how much your government wants to control you.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:24:11
Thanks for all the awesome tips, dude!
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:12:55
People need to relax. In the grand scheme of things, we are working with a new currency. It also serves right now to hedge against the USD and other currencies. As fiat fails, why are we surprised at high valuations and increases?
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:32:35
I am lucky enough to still be living at home. I have some fiat debt but I could go underground with Bitcoin really.
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:20:57
You'd definitely be violating their rules. Revenue is revenue. That being said, I'm sure you could get away with it for a little while.
Actually, there's a review process, at least with Apple's App Store. That would be kinda interesting. I'd want to see how it'd play out.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:20:59
Don't we love market fluidity though? Just wait until they start automated trading like NYSE.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:06:54
Let the market take care of it. Use whatever exchange is best. If Bitcoin is a badass, as I suspect it is, nothing will tarnish it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 06:31:31
Bitcoin: virtual currency, *real* change.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:39:48
I think they're just a little unsure, but once they understand it, it'll be awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:15:25
It would force the currencies to trade on fundamentals. Bitcoin would win especially with markets developing around it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:44:40
It is very much private. It's a black box that has owners, makes revenue for only those owners, answers to no one, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:59:55
So, how does it protect us?
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:55:29
That makes perfect sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:51:20
I dunno. That sounds retarded though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:59:04
I'm sorry, but I really just don't agree with anything you're saying. OP understands this effect of a valued currency well. In fact, deflation will empower the common man because he will simply need to earn money rather than participate in business or market schemes to see valuable returns.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:05:35
I've generally found Fox Business to be about as pro-liberty and things that make sense as mainstream media comes. It tends to not be biased toward anything except financial reality.
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:49:41
I loved reading that. Your cutting into the raw economics of it, the logical reality, was awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:16:01
What's a good wallet for this?
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:55:28
This is the whole reason why BTC disappoints me. I wish it had an ecosystem that thrived on its own.
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:00:35
Does anyone know if BitPay has long term plans to be the Visa of Bitcoin? If they continue innovating, that would be great. Even if Bitcoin ultimately lost the crypto wars, the infrastructure could work for anything.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:00:38
I agree with your analysis wholeheartedly. Deflation is the anti-bubble and the key to LRAS growth.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:41:13
Same here!
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:46:29
Sounds like he'd be pretty stupid not to take the discount. Although, after reading some experiences here, I don't know whether or not he's going to run into issues trying to convert that much.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:31:16
I completely agree with you! Can we push for a microexchange or something of that nature?
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:59:37
Does this mean that difficulty increases as the short-term network power increases, but returns back down when the short-term network power decreases?
