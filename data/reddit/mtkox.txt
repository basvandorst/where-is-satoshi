Saw a BITCOIN plate in Austin, TX this weekend! Didn't take note of the state, but it didn't look like a Texas one. Maybe someone's on a road trip!

I actually had no idea that existed.. I think it's a new bot..

Just please, please don't do like I did with my first hoard.. It's not **your** savings unless you alone control the private keys!

Middleman does deal with middleman to take payments. ^(You don't need either of these big companies to take bitcoin.)^^(*ducks*)

Some of us appreciate it!

Can we have a discussion here?

Woohoo! Finally some open source work from Coinbase! [Dis Gon B Gud](

Alright! I've been waiting for another *"cold-storage"* solution like this. And this one looks extra safe! Locking up all my bitcoins now.
@_date: 2014-07-23 16:21:27
That ended in a surprisingly pleasant way.

No, he's clearly in favor of this censorship.

Has any petition like this ever worked?

Most people can drive cars just fine without hiring a driver. They don't need to know how they work or how to fix them when they're broken.
@_date: 2014-07-23 01:37:52
How about we cut out the censorship and let the voting system do it's job?
This is clearly a subjective assessment. Moderators are here to enforce rules when they're clearly broken; issues this contested are rightfully up to the community to decide.

Decentralized exchange, built in to wallets. Please and thank you.

No, those are renamed bitcoin-clones with different variables ("altcoins"). Ethereum is a completely new software project, with potential implications for bitcoin and blockchain-based technologies.

I wonder how many other people are still keeping all of their bitcoins in online bitcoin ~~banks~~ ~~brokers~~ ~~exchanges~~ *"wallets"* ...

Just curious (I really haven't followed may proposals), how would you game this, and what would you gain?
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:32:10
And also with you.
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:02:30
Just be sure you store the private key yourself...

I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Thanks.
