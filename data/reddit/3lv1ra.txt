Well the future will definitely HODL Bitcoin. Whether it will be useful or not is another story.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:18
Without mining, there would be no bitcoin. Don't be silly. 
Also, more Bitcoin is always better, if you can, why not?

Putting on my prophet hat. I'm guessing that they will add some kind of extension that if say, the coin hasn't been touched in 50 years the address owner gets a notification. 
If there is no response it gets added back into the pool to be re-processed? 
Just speculating obviously, we're going to need to address the issue at some stage.

Lol. So the entire market crashes and it's Ver's fault? 
Get a life.

The solution is just to HODL mate. We know we said it's your money, but you don't get to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:37:23
How about no.

ETH is locked up due to CryptoKittens, that use to be a safe space to dump your crypto in the midst of huge fluctuations. 
The silver coin has been the least volatile other option available, now it's rising and actually "appears" to be profitable. 
My bet is that once BTC calms down Silver will drop again.

Last time I checked chemo had 90+% failure rate. 
So goodluck with that.

A. Bitcoin isn't useable as a day to day currency. Especially for low income countries. Slow-High fees.
B. Zimbabwe is already looking at implementing DASH, which is a low fee, fast transaction coin.

Bitcoin had some crappy code. Dev's refused to fix said bugs and instead just promised bigger blogs, ignoring said crappy code. 
Bitcoin Cash (remains to be seen) does not have the same shitty bugs. 
We only have space for one leading crypto coin. Miners realized that and starting collectively mining Cash forcing slow transaction rates and higher fees.

That religious YouTube channel for Bitcoin Core which keeps on feeding you make believe internet stories without anything to actually back it up.

The ultimate HODL. 
But seriously, if this did happen hold your keys, civilization will probably rebuild as a technocracy (because ffs, if you still believe in politicians after that shot your a retard AND we have the tech to have a technocracy everything is just being held back by this current bag of bullsht sand we lug around)   and crypto will become the new currency of choice. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:12:11
So do I. Then again, I have no desire to die young. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:36:05
Because people are lazy and want something for nothing, not realizing that investing/mining crypto in the beginning was also a lot of work/time/money.

I'm guessing that this isn't a global offer?
