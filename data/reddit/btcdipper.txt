I'm not sure I understand your request.  The amount you want to invest is up to you.  I'm just trying to explain that with $600.00 you are not going to get a lot of action.  Buy leveraging it by 50x you can get much more.  All the best, Louis

Crashing?  I don't think so, it's just going down for the moment, but it could crash if the market continues having problems engaging in reverse.

Hi Mark, sorry I don't quite understand what you mean by "No summary?".  Basically it's a service that would allow a user that has an account with kraken futures to jump on reversal of dips, and have a trailing stop put on that order.  I have used the system for me that past days and does not bad, when it detects a spike (up or down) it opens an order when the spike reverses, and then put's in a trailing stop so if the spike was a raise in the price you end up with a short position and the reverse if it was a price drop, then the program continuously monitors the market and adjusts the trailing stop to your specification.  The basic starting fee would be 0.0005 BTC and that would give you the programs (if you want to open your positions manually and then have the program monitor you trailing stops) and the service for 30 days.  Thanks for your interest, Louis

We are just missing the word "exchange" after Bitcoin, no big deal.

You can not predict what is going to happen, so your example even thought it is correct in it's number, is not in anyway what will happen in the future.   Technically you could make millions per day by buying just before it spikes, then selling all you have and shorting just before it drops and then reburying before it goes up.  If you know what is going to happen it's a no brainer.  NO technique can guarantee absolute profit (or loss!).

You must open an account with Kraken, and then fund it, then buy bitcoin and transfer it to your futures wallet.  Once that is done let me know.  Then we can try btcdipper.

With all due respect, I think we are at a turning point where for the first time in history the lows one year apart are equal.  To me this means a major change in direction,  I would be very surprised to visit 5 digits in the next 5 years.  But as I have always said, no one can tell. No one.

It's like I always said.  No one,  no one can predict.

I think your best chances would be with btcdipper with your 600.00 you could go in with the equivalent of about $20000.00.  The most you could lose is $600.00.  The system is not quite functional at this time, but PM me and I could help you get going.  Good luck!

Yes, I'm sure that is possible, I would first [setup a full node]( I did one about a week ago, took about 24 hours to get up and synced \~ 300G disk space.  That way you are more participating in the processing of transactions.  I think you have options in the full node to mine, but not too sure on that side of it.
