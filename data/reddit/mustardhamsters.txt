Bring it on. I'm in for the next order of magnitude.

This is it, this is the actual moon.

And you're still in traffic like everybody else.

$10k has kind of always been the moon for me. Especially after it hit $1k I've been waiting for each order of magnitude.

That is certainly not the case, as I just bought some myself. I'd just like to see someone make a reasoned argument for why they think it will continue growing instead of extrapolating with no basis. 
There's no reason to say a 5% day over day growth will continue. I'd be very happy if it did, but it's misleading to say that it will or that it has value now because of a theoretical value in the future.

Fair enough. Like I said, it'll be interesting if it hits $1k in any context. It's already kind of fun to watch it fluctuate.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:34:24
Still a long ways away. We'll see! Also: your chart claims $2k/BTC, but I'll still be interested to see if it gets as high as $1k.

So here we are on June 2nd. The current price on MtGox is $120. You're $880 short of your claim.
Almost nothing grows at a 5% day over day rate. Your projection made no sense when you made these claims two months ago, and it still doesn't make sense now. I get that you were probably caught up in the excitement, but you should understand that making these types of claims is misleading to people who don't know better (yourself included). That's irresponsible.

That would be an interesting bet to make, though. It's a pretty fair investigation of current vs future value.

I'm pretty deeply embedded in the tech business scene, and I'm very much familiar with the growth rates of tech companies. I'm also familiar with the people making those pitches and claims, and how many of them make the kinds of projections you're making only to crash and burn. So I'm skeptical, but not unwilling to take a chance here because of the potential upside and the comparison to other tech adoptions.
I'll definitely be watching closely, and I've put in a calendar reminder to follow up with you on the 2nd. I think there will be some growth in that time, but not as much as you estimate. *Eh, maybe I'm not prepared to make that kind of statement* ~~I might even be willing to put a bet on it, maybe I'll give you a bitcoin if it breaks $2k, otherwise you pay me the difference between the price and your estimate? I'll have to think about it. ;)~~

What are you basing this projection on? You just really like the number 5? This is effectively pulled out of your ass, there's no backing whatsoever to any part of your "analysis".
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:33:50
That doesn't mean it will persist. You're just projecting a current trend into the future, generally you have to have some kind of basis for why that would continue.
Edit: The other problem here is that a 5% day over day growth at the prices you're taking your sample from is small– only a $5 day to day fluctuation at most for many days. Towards the end of your chart the swings are in the $50-100 range. The multiple seems fine at first glance, but as the price goes up it will be harder for new investors to get involved and appear even more inflated. Where is that demand coming from?
