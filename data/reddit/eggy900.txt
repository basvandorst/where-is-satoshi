Having a donation QR is the best way IMO, on shorts or banner (or baseball cap for post fight interview). I'm sure Joe would draw attention to it too. Trying to organise "sponsorship" before the fight sounds like a lot more trouble.
MMA is very much a "what have you done for me lately" sport and I think the btc community is the same, take a leap, show your qr and the bitcoin logo and the community will reward you.
Even for people not watching it'll get screengrabbed and posted here. Good for you, good for the sport. I knew absolutely nothing about NASCAR before the doge guys sponsored a car.

So why would an "intellectual" be more interested in bitcoin than someone who's "smart"? 
Spotting opportunities is one of the best indicators of a good businessman, something that Dana is constantly doing to expand his business

I asked them just after takeaway.com started accepting btc and they said they were looking into it, I'm a bit surprised they haven't done it yet.
Hopefully today's HMRC announcement will push a lot of businesses who've been considering it in the right direction

The live events industry can benefit massively from bitcoin, fees from ticketmaster etc are an absolute killer

Very surprised at such a reasonable policy! Good news for bitcoin and hopefully other countries will follow suit

Oh yeah, I was recommending it as an investment to my boss when we were around $120 in October all the way up to $300 when he said "it's got to come back down soon", he keeps very quiet about it now. 
One of the guys who bought in around $400 (and hasn't really read up on the massive social and economic potential) is adamant that he's going to sell all of his as soon as it gets to $800 again. I hope for his sake he keeps at least 1 btc.

Virwox has always been quick and easy for me, but the fees are a joke and new accounts have low limits for card/paypal
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:45:18
I'm a massive UFC fan and would love to get behind this but it's not as simple as other sports, there's a "UFC Tax" that all sponsors have to pay to be allowed in the octagon and it's rumoured to be $100k a year. This hurts a lot of smaller sponsors and fighters but the UFC love having control over their product.
The other thing to consider is a patch on the shorts is way less prominent than a whole car graphic, and you'd probably be sharing it with 5 other logos. Joe Rogan only commentates on PPVs and "big" Fox cards now, you'd have to pick a fighter on the main card of one of those events
Having said that, Alex Caceras is a good suggestion, Conor McGregor too, more exposure but sure as hell more expensive
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:46:50
Why aren't they likely to buy? The UFC's 18-35 Male demographic crosses over with bitcoin almost exactly

The most effective regulator is the blockchain. Selectively enforced regulation and human greed got us into this problem, but algorithms can't be bribed.

Shame he's gonna get his ass beat by Tyron Woodley this weekend!!
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:45:06
Is that gonna be televised or is it a fightpass event? I'm guessing fightpass :/ Joe Rogan almost definitely won't be commentating
Bit of a shame as several of the top fighters mentioned here are fighting on it. I think to be effective we'd have to sponsor more than one, or risk being ignored by the commentary team and logo barely being televised. 
I think several of the fighters on here would be receptive:
Conor McGregor	vs.	Cole Miller				
Gunnar Nelson	vs.	Ryan LaFlare				
Brad Pickett	vs.	Ian McCall				
Tom Lawlor	        vs.	Ilir Latifi				
Cody Donovan	vs.	Nikita Krylov				
Neil Seery	        vs.	Phil Harris

Yes, pretty much every big town has one and they're the most popular place to go to buy/sell used games, blurays, consoles and electronics.
The atmosphere in my local one definitely feels more like an independent shop than a chain, with staff who know what they're doing
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:24:49
Bitcoinsports.eu is definitely not reliable, lots of bettors and investors owed money with no response from owner for a month
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:51:42
That's cool, wonder what takeaway.com's is. I use them over just-eat now because they take bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:06:23
Really really nice features and design, excellent work. Is there a tip address for the devs?
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:56:07
Yeah, zipzap looked hopeful, we'll see what happens with coinfloor. I hate having to tell people that virwox is the easiest way
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:13:14
Yeah we need this in the UK, friends and family keep asking me where to buy bitcoin and I don't like directing them to all the foreign exchanges that require loads of ID or risky bank transfers

I like when companies like this, with relatively modern online business models, start accepting bitcoin. Groupon &amp; Just-Eat next!! 
It makes so much sense for them just from a transaction fee point of view, but I can't wait to see what new business models startups can come up with, with bitcoin from the start

Awesome, bitcoin is perfect for their business model. Not been there for a while but I'm sure I'll make more use of it now.
Would be even better if sellers could get paid in bitcoin too

I really like Kiva and their model, I've been telling my friends for ages that this is a much better way to leverage their savings than sticking it in a bank at 0.5% interest. 
I bet a lot of bitcoiners holding onto big stashes would love to be able to invest btc in entrepreneurs around the developing world. I just hope Kiva can work out a way to do this so that it's not just btc payments converted straight to USD

@_date: 2014-02-23 06:34:31

This makes much more sense for exposure than a surfer IMO, especially if you can get a fighter on a Fox event which get a lot more viewers than the PPVs, the Fox Sport 1 events get a lot of viewers too but Joe doesn't commentate on them.
There's a lot of options for international fighters too, UFC is massive in Brazil and it's getting strong TV, Online and Live Event followings all over the world.
It might not be that simple though, the UFC has a supposed $100k a year "sponsor tax" and a blacklist:

The only instant deposit/buy at the moment is virwox, with low limits and high fees. There's coinfloor that takes a while to deposit and european exchanges like kraken and bitstamp that take even longer. Quite a few sellers on localbitcoins though

A lot of users of bitcoinsports.eu (including myself) have been awaiting fairly substantial payouts for several months, just see the long list of angry bettors and investors on the [forum thread](
It is a really good system, no account needed etc but they've owed me almost 1 btc for 3 months so I've lost all trust and I've since started using [bitbook.biz]( whose payouts are a lot quicker, it's just a bit less convenient putting btc into your account before being able to bet but still way better than traditional sports books
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:32:43
We use Misco as one of our suppliers at work, stuff like this makes us more likely to want to accept (and hold) bitcoin in the future

In the UK the "pay points" that zipzap will use are already widely in use for things like utility bills and council tax and the few times I've bought uKash (to deposit on exchanges in March) it was very quick and easy and the staff knew what they were doing

I've only been using takeaway.com lately. I asked just eat on Twitter about bitcoin a couple of months ago and they said they were looking into it
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:19:15
Other Brits will agree that a qr code on-screen next to the phone number would be a massive endorsement for bitcoin

I've gone a bit quieter in recent weeks too
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:20:52

I suggested he get one on his hat, which would've got lots of close up air time and possibly a mention in the post fight interview with joe rogan. 
The one flaw in that plan was that you only get the interview if you win, which he should've done, as 3/1 favourite. With 3 losses in a row now he probably won't be fighting in the UFC again to try it differently
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:30:47

In my IT department we've all heard of it (because when 1 person hears about it everyone hears about it!) and 3/7 of us hold a substantial amount of it. 
But probably only about 10% of the rest of the organisation have heard of it without us telling them, and another 10% after we've told them. 
Among my friends and direct family almost everyone has a little bit, because I try and pay them back or buy things in btc when they'll take it, and my family got paper wallets for christmas

If you're going through virwox (and their insane fees) you can already withdraw to paypal -&gt; withdraw to bank account -&gt; withdraw from cash point, all in 15 minutes.
Works OK for me, it's just the fees that bug me

For sure, but that article should serve as a wake up call for a lot of Guardian readers. Public disdain for bankers and politicians is at an all time high in the UK and a lot of people just need a nudge before they start looking for alternatives to fiat. 
Remember that most people on this sub didn't know much about the evil of the fiat system until they learned about bitcoin and why it's better

Not even going to respond to this? Obviously a scam or just incompetence on the part of the developer, thanks for stealing 3.4 btc, serves me right for testing it with real stakes, this alone has really made me rethink bitcoins

Any forecasts for profit? The margins seem very tight
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:35:45
Yeah, I bear the cost of it for the ease of use, and of course the price is up since I last bought so the fee is negligible now, I'm normally around 60% discount so it's not too bad now

My xbox gold ran out the other day so I've been looking for a site like this to accept btc.

@_date: 2013-11-11 19:56:04
This is an awesome first step, although there's only 6 takeaways in my area and only one of them takes Btc or card. Maybe that's why I've never heard of them before
There's 25 on JustEat and they all take card already, hopefully just eat will start taking bitcoin soon and really open up the whole take-away market!
