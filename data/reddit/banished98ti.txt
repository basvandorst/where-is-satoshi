I've done it before for smaller sums buying on 1 exchange and selling another and using the banking system. Sometimes because of the price spread the fee came to zero but usually its much higher. On localbitcoins Ive tried it as well with fees ranging anywhere from 0.5-7%. It really depends on the price spreads.
Actually in many 'poorer' countries they have a pretty sophisticated transfer service between bank accounts so a total trip with localbitcoins lasted maybe 10 minutes if the btc buyer was online. 10min from time bitcoin was deposited to $ in bank account. Of course North American banking is still in stone age...
It all depends really, I wouldn't say bitcoin killer app will be remittance.

Money never began with barter. Tribal societies were gift societies they frowned upon or kicked out anyone who was becoming wealthy at the expense of the tribe.
Money has always been associated with the state because at its core money is credit based. The precious metal value of a coin meant nothing, the stamp of the state is what gave money value because the state accepted it back in the form of taxes.
As we see even here gold was forced upon the economy in the 1800's by the oligarchs of that time and when we study the 1800-1900 period we see massive debt deflation leading to huge concentration of wealth amongst a few hands. Bitcoin is a throwback to this era.

Capitalism is state sponsored usury. You really think putting people into 20hr slave factories and polluting everything around you is 'lifting all boats'?
Stop bringing up communism as the only alternative to usurious capitalism, its a STALE outdated arguement. Capitalism and communism are flip sides of the same coin, both are built on materialism the difference is capitalism is more efficient. Both systems promise heaven on earth but deliver HELL for the vast majority, look at US where 3/4ths of the population are both mentally and physically ILL.
In a capitalist society corporations replace communist commissars. The lies spun are the same just of a different degree. The state actively supports and defends moneylenders via public institutions such as the court system and 'contract law'. This is the heart of the political problem facing the US since 1776, the conflict between creditors and debtors. Read about Shay's rebellion. Look at 2008 all 'homeowners' turned into renters now while the same guys who gave out the loans are thriving. Capitalism is not about free markets or consumer choice its about protecting the interests of a RENTIER class who do nothing all day.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:10:35
Capitalism the way it is practiced is STATE SPONSORED USURY. Please use a dictionary to understand what that means. Capitalism drives wages down while encouraging debt with interest attached as the alternative, this inevitably leads to a crisis. The history of capitalism is a history of debt crisis.
When moneylenders don't see their debts repaid they use FORCE to seize wealth. I said it earlier, no productive force in the world can keep up with compound interest. Usury was illegal in traditional societies hence why all revolutions brought upon with them the re institution of legal usury. Moneylenders need a state to enforce their claims on peoples labor.
Capitalism cannot exist without a strong state to enforce its basic tenants, namely DEBT contracts. Produce a single historic example of a capitalist system without a powerful state. It doesn't exist, capitalism cannot function unless the state is enforcing its excessive rents on productive activity. 
I am absolutely not against the right to own and trade property but that is NOT what we have currently. What we have is the creditor class driving everyone else into the wall with a grind and illegally stealing property. Capitalism(as it is practiced today) is anti-property, anti-wealth, anti-labor period. The bitcoin community is a micro-cosm of an anti-social libertarian society and look at it. Nothing outside of scams, thefts, gambling, porn, drugs is produced in this space. Great freedom pal.

The least transparent exchange in Bitcoin has proven to be the most reliable because it relies on REPUTATION.

Bitcoin can't be a digital 'cash for everyone' because its designed to reward those who came first via deflation. A 'cash for everyone' system requires a soft currency not a hard currency. It has nothing to do with transaction costs. This is the same reason why gold encourages poverty for the vast majority of the population just read about 19th century England, that is how a 'bitcoin world' would look like.
A soft currency system is a ledger that keeps track of debts, the debts act as money. Meaning those involved in productive activity get financed easily and labor power is rewarded with the purchasing power they themselves create. What we have in bitcoin is the anti-thesis to all of that we want to reward those who 'hoard' digits in the past at the defacto expense of those producing wealth now. Do you understand this concept? The entire point of money is to allocate present resources for *future* output. Bitcoin is designed the exact opposite.
The entire transaction crowd is completely oblivious to the fundamental economic problems with bitcoin. Look at early adopters what did they invest in? Exchanges to get fiat and vices like gambling,gambling and scams to attract more people to help boost the value of their coins. Name a single firm in this space that has benefited anyone but early hoarders. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:42:34
No economy can grow as fast as compound interest. It's simple math here. You will never increase productivity as fast to keep up, you end up with an indebted economy leading to debt deflation because nobody has money left to spend. What you think happened with the housing market, Greenspan raised interest rates by 700%.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:00:16
Ver and Voorhees invested nothing because bitcoin was worth nothing at that time, its the guys buying now at multi billion valuations who are sweating because they transferred their purchasing power over to Ver and Voorhees. Voorhees just spins fairytales how much 'freedom' you get by buying his bitcoins while he sits on some island in the middle of nowhere. Freedom to these guys means getting you on their gambling,porn,investment scams.
 You understand how this all works? The guys who put in the least get the most. Read Hal Finney who understood the nature of this game right from the get go. That is how bitcoin is structured the same way the gold standard was setup. Guys with bags of gold would lend them out at 10% interest and use the court system to seize peoples assets when they couldn't pay because of the inevitable deflation. Libertarianism at its core is anti-wealth because it encourages anti-social activity. Wealth can only be created through social interaction.
Voorhees the social libertarian came out with a gambling site to create a stream of addicts. That was his greatest accomplishment. What about Ver? He was an insider at Mtgox and now runs bitcoin.com where he proudly misleads newcomers onto his casino.
These guys are VAMPIRES nothing more, they have added zero to this space. People on here need to stop worshiping a bunch of clowns who preach fairy tales while getting filthy rich. How many bitcoin success stories can you really name 8 years in? The early guys who held on are rich while everyone else sits on fiat losses. Its zero sum remember either you have bitcoins or fiat what changes is the exchange ratio between them.
Bitcoiners are so demoralized they have no defense mechanism to protect them from falling for the same scam over and over. They look to computer code to do replace the moral order. Well here we are 8 years into bitcoin and how toxic is this space? Can anyone be trusted? Has anything been built that has credibility? 3 years after gox we still have the top tier exchanges being 'hacked' with no evidence. Wake up.

Wealth inequality will always exist. The problem with the present setup is we have unnatural inequality existing because of compound interest. Nobody in the 'economics' profession is even addressing the elephant in the room. Austrian libertarians actually encourage it. 
Bitcoin solves none of the fundamental problems with the monetary system because bitcoin is designed to reward those who previously held sterile digits at the expense of those who have to labor now. Look at how bitcoin is concentrated a few hands own all the coins and promote different schemes to help them increase in value.

I don't, but big short coverings usually indicate a topping process or near one.
You also need to take under consideration that all bitcoin exchanges are run by or owned by early adopters. These guys own the majority of BTC supply and are able to see how much fiat is on the exchanges, so they can run the tape so to speak. They can see when people are anxious to buy so they can raise the ASK price since they own all the supply regardless, once all the fiat is transferred to them they can start dumping coins knowing that they have the fiat(bids) and can stop the price drop at any time. So they run the price back down to get those traders to panic sell them back their bitcoin. Wash rinse and repeat.
If there is one thing to be learned in bitcoin is nothing is to be believed. Remember Karpeles utilized this method in 2013 and friday pump sessions were the norm during his reign.
Simple math proves bitcoin is and always will be a wealth transfer tool for those who mined them earlier and stayed on long enough to con everyone else out of their money. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:19:58
Ya I dont want to brag but here we are barely able to hold 1k(in last few hours), since I said heavy short covering is *bearish* for the price. If we had people piling on more and more shorts Id be bullish. Of course I am not calling anything based on a screenshot from fake Chinese exchanges.
What people don't understand about bitcoin is miner rent increases in real terms with price. Meaning the more expensive bitcoin is the more burdensome the cost to maintain the mining network even though the same number of bitcoins are being transacted on it. That's price negative.
Miners *have to* sell bitcoin because their expenses(taxes,electricity,wages) are all denominated in fiat! And you bet they are selling to enjoy these fat profit margins provided by the bag-holding libertarians!
Miners incur fiat liabilities but produce bitcoin. Its a natural mismatch which translates to SELL pressure! They need fiat to extinguish those liabilities.

His liquidation did help pop the price up but its already a passed event. A high amount of shorts guarantees bidders during heavy selling which keeps the price from plunging, a lack of shorts removes this.
Remember short covering has the same effect as buying bitcoin. If shorts are giving up by panic covering its bearish for the price not bullish after the initial spike up.
Price is the last sale which is the past what matters is bid/ask which are 2 prices and the sizing on both.

My perspective is common sense, something you will not find in this subreddit.
It's a scam plain and simple the same way the gold standard was. I'm not talking about 'equality' which is a lie itself.
The gold standard kept money artificially scarce in the economy so you had a permanent deflation. This led to people forced to *borrow* from the rich who overtime became even richer from taking over the debtors properties since the debt could never be repaid.
Bitcoin is the same thing. Its suppose to be a money that is artificially kept scarce to *protect* the large holders from supposed inflation. Ever wonder why bitcoin retailers have such poor sales? Because nobody actually has enough bitcoin to spend. It's all hoarded by maybe 100 people.
In practice bitcoin experiences bouts of hyperinflation and hyperdeflation. For example bitcoin denominated prices in 2013 deflated by 95% but price inflation in 2014 was something like 800%!
Bitcoin is built on Murrary Rothbards utter crude understanding of what money is, namely gold shekels that swell in value on their own.
Bitcoiners are terribly ignorant of what money is and are driven by faith based *beliefs*. This leads to the horrible volatility and un-moneyness of bitcoin. 
It's a belief system pushing a libertarian ideology with it to cover for the fact that bitcoin makes a small group of people rich at the *expense* of the larger group. I don't know why people are willfully oblivious to this fact. Early guys got a huge number of coins for free but *late* comers find them extremely difficult to get(without paying huge fiat to early adopters).

In a fiat money system 0% is the natural rate of interest, the fed intervenes to prop interest rates *higher* then they otherwise would be. Why do you think everytime the economy slows the market sends rates back to zero? That is where they always would be without the fed propping them up.
No the government does not give you other peoples money. Where do the dollars you have in your pocket come from? They all come from government spending. The economic lesson of WW2 was that the government does *not* finance itself with taxation when they were running 25% budget deficits to mobilize resources.
The government can very well do that in peacetime as well if the economy is under capacity and high unemployment or high underemployment like now.
The reason you are having a hardtime understanding this and resorting to name calling is because its *truth* and pal, it just hit you like a shit ton of bricks.

Pegging your currency requires you to accumulate the currency you pegged too. The only way to do that is to run an export surplus, meaning you have to drive wages down in your home economy so people can't afford imports. Every net exporting economy has low wages or lower then they otherwise should be.
When this doesn't happen you start losing the pegged currency because people exchange it, example pesos get exchanged for dollars. Your balance eventually dwindles and you are forced to go off the peg and your currency plunges leading to extremely high inflation.
Venuzeula and Argentina ran trade deficits which led to a loss of dollars because of the idiotic peg, once peg collapses the inflation is high.
Pegged currencies almost always end in hyperinflation the only examples of this not being the case is somewhere like hong kong(it will eventually occur there too).
A sovereign nation with its own currency and functioning institutions never has to 'peg its currency' and can never 'run out of money'. The question isn't a lack of money its whether they are able to efficiently allocate resources.

Well yes since youve given your fiat to an early adopter to finance their lifestyle why of course they want you to hodl. They want to be the only ones doing the selling for more fiat. Hodling means bagholding, learn that concept. You never want a client dumping the shares you just sold him.

The underlying theory doesn't apply to floating exchange rates. Austrian economics was formulated during an era of fixed to gold currencies, it may very well have applied then but it has no bearing to how the world works today. 
Austrians think if the private sector is engaging in rentier activity, ie taxing you for the use of public domain that somehow this is perfectly fine. But if the government engages in hampering rentier activity than it is 'tyranny' and anti-liberty. 
So if I pay 20% interest to a private bank for nothing, defacto as a 'rent' to use money, the Austrians call that the 'freemarket'. If the government removes this rent by setting the rate at zero(since it is the monopoly issuer of the currency) Austrians somehow attack this as anti-freedom.

You don't 'make money' from bitcoin. You sell bitcoin to someone who gives you their fiat money. Bitcoin is always zero sum. Either someone has it or doesn't. The total amount of bitcoin = total mined bitcoins at all times! All that occurs is ownership changes between parties.
In order to attract fiat money into the space the bitcoin early adopters immediately created an environment that promotes addiction. They setup gambling dens(satoshidice), drug operations(silkroad), pornography, ponzischemes(pirate40). Vice ensures addicts provide a consistent stream of fiat. Man has as many masters as he has vices so if you understand this youll understand the importance of why bitcoiners promote slavery.
The second thing they did was to setup exchanges, remember Mtgox had cozy relationship with bitcoin insiders. So youve got a ecosystem where the supply of bitcoin is in few hands, the same hands that control the exchanges and control the bitcoin criminal business.
In order to give an aurora of legitimacy to all of this the libertarians came in with 'Austrian economics' and other voodoo Ayn Rand theories as justification for what is at its core wealth transfer!

Yes the US dollar loses value over time but the total supply of dollars buys more goods and services than ever before. You also have thousands of investment vehicles available to preserve wealth with.
Why does money have to be an investment vehicle when money is sterile? Its merely a unit of account for debt. On its own its worthless.
If nobody is producing wealth then money can't buy anything! Whats the value of bitcoin if it can't be exchanged for fiat? Zero.
The value of a single dollar is meaningless, whats important is how much goods and services are produced by the economy.

Except bitcoin doesn't actually store wealth. Bitcoin is just a number on a ledger. 
Think about it if you are in a country with a collapsing economy that means supplies such as food,electricity have become scarce. Assuming your smartphone works how does staring at your bitcoin balance(a bunch of numbers) or a bitcoin price ticker resolve the situation you are in? It doesn't. 
So you'll walk over to a food producer who has food and tell him give it to me in exchange for these numbers that exist in the cloud? Ya that's really going to fly...
Hyperinflation scenarios are always brought about because of a massive supply shock where production collapses so there is no goods to buy in the economy. Bitcoin doesn't do anything to protect you from this. In a hyperinflation economy the guy who has real estate and a productive garden to feed himself is richer then the bitcoiner on the street groveling at his bitcoins.
People on here are so hopelessly enamored with a flawed belief system they can't even come to the conclusion that wealth only comes from human labor not from staring at shiney rocks copulate or bitcoin price tickers.

Like I said. Money is merely an accounting unit. This subreddit treats it as if its suppose to be an investment vehicle in and of itself.
Ive outlined how that it is impossible and Ive also debunked that bitcoin is not really a hedge for any cataclysmic event. Bitcoin is engineered as a wealth transfer scheme even Hal Finney understood this. 
The guys who get all the wealth are the early adopters who sell late comers coins they got for free. What do they do with your fiat money? They buy real assets like stocks, real estate and so forth. Guess what, all of those are fiat earning.
Look how bitcoin supply was given out the earliest guys got the most and the late comers have to compete for less and less. Its setup to transfer wealth from a larger group into a smaller...

The litmus test for currency is simple. Does a state accept it in payment of taxes?
In bitcoins case the answer is no. So is bitcoin a currency. NO.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:01:53
The government takes payment of taxes in its own liability. That is what drives demand for the currency. You need DOLLARS to do business in the US to fullfill your debt to the state.
Business accepts dollars because they need dollars to pay their debt(taxes) to the state. Taxation is sufficient to drive demand for currency. Business offers products/services in exchange for those dollars. 
When bitcoins are issued there is no entity required to take them back in payment of anything. So when demand is very low there is no one removing supply, they are still minted which contributes to even more volatility. Did you not see how we can lose 1/3rd of value in a matter of hours? 
Bitcoin is not currency nor money. The fact that we quote everything including bitcoin prices in dollars is a testament to that. When was the last time someone offered goods/services directly for bitcoin and quoted them in bitcoin? It rarely if ever happens.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:43:29

Um no the market is not 'an awesome and intangible force very much like the weather'.
The market is composed of human buyers and sellers.
In bitcoin, those sellers are primarily early adopters who own the vast majority of coins and miners.
The exchanges where the 'market' is functioning are *also owned by the same early adopters*.
Do you see like umm a massive conflict of interest here? The bitcoin market is supplied and owned by a tiny group of people. How exactly does that make the 19 billion market cap real? It doesn't.
Satoshi + Ver + Voorhees + Winklevoss own upwards of 22% of sellable bitcoin in existence. The annual bitcoin supply increases by something like 5%, that entire new supply is delivered by 1 or 2 mining pools.
It is not far fetched to say that less than 100 individuals control even 90% of all bitcoins in existence. If you look at Ethereum, 82% of coins are held by insiders. Bitcoin is no different.
People are utterly clueless to the mechanics of the bitcoin market and no there is nothing 'far too complex' about it. Early adopters are always in control.

The pizza was bought with US dollars from someones credit card. Thanks for leaving that part out.
At the time mining 10k bitcoin took literally zero effort so nobody valued bitcoin, hence why Laszlo was willing to part with his 10k. It took him nothing to get it.
Thats exactly how a ponzi scheme works, the earliest adopters put in the least but come out with the most. The fact that laszlo didn't care about 10k of BTC reflects that. 
Later on you have some early adopters throwing millions here and there and being philanthropists because in the end they are also throwing zero work/effort, just free money that came to them from bagholders. So yes if I got lets say 1k btc from running my computer for a few hours and in a year I can buy a Ferrari, fuck why not? On my end of the transaction its free but on the bagholders end who had to give me the 300-400k it took a ton of labor!

This subreddit obsessed with the Austrian economics cult believes by handing trillions of dollars in interest payments to idle bondholders it will improve the economy.
They also believe in money that should be artificially kept scarce and hoarded by the same tiny elite.
Its incredible to me how a subreddit entirely comprised of poor people with meager shavings has internalized the commands of their oppressors to such a point.
Like the fed just raised interest rates by 100% but the media reports it as by 0.25% because its a smaller number. Going from 0.25 to 0.5 is an increase of 100%. 
If you are a bondholder with billions you just received an income boost if you are someone in this subreddit with $500 in your bank account your monthly mortgage just spiked. 
Lets all cheer and give more of our income to bitcoin early adopters and Asian miners to save our value!

For every bitcoin fiat millionaire thousands of people have to be sitting on losses. Mathematically it cannot be any other way!
When bitcoin came back over 600-700 we had a huge influx of people coming out of the woodwork admitting to the huge losses they incurred over the past 3 years, how many people actually sat through 80-90% drawdowns? Very little..
Remember for an early adopter to cashout 1 million USD, someone/some group had to give it to them, so that group is now 'short' dollars. Its simple math here bro. Bitcoin is a wealth transfer scheme the same way the gold standard was, that why so many billionaires want it back! Free money on the backs of someone else.

No they aren't. If all investments were zero sum there would *never* be any wealth produced.
Capital + labor = new wealth.
It is absolutely not zero sum. When Apple produces a smartphone is that zero sum? No, new wealth was produced(smartphone).
Bitcoin is zero sum because all that ever occurs is an asset swap.
When you sell bitcoin someone else has them and now you have fiat. On a balance sheet nothing has changed, no new wealth created. You can swap bitcoins all day long and new wealth is *never* created.

Your PHD was during the monetarist take over of US educational institutions(70s-90s). They also *removed* economic history as a subject. Gee, I wonder why.
Monetarism has been thoroughly debunked because it assumes money itself is wealth. Everywhere that monetarism has been implemented(Chile, Eastern Europe) resulted in massive unemployment and misery for a huge swath of the population while a few people got rich.
You cannot have hyperinflation unless production of goods collapses. There is no case example of this ever occurring outside of this scenario. Everyone brings up Zimbabwe but fails to mention that farm production collapsed by 70%.
My understanding is correct, no sane economist takes monetarism seriously anymore. The damage done by this pseudo-theory is solely responsible for US manufacturing being offshored.

Monetarism = central planning of the economy by attempting to control the money supply.

Austrian economics is a shameful ideology and pseudoeconomics.
Austrians are always in hysteria that hyperinflation is 10 minutes away. They want a money system where hoarders watch their sterile shekels swell up in value at the expense of the entire economy.
Bitcoin vested interests use Austrian ideology to hide the fact that bitcoin itself is a wealth transfer mechanism and to foster a perpetual state of *ignorance*.
Austrian theory may hold ground in a monetary system based on fixed exchange rates but that is not the world we live in so their theories are utterly worthless in explaining anything. 
Here is a debate between Austrian economics chief priest Robert Murphy vs Warren Mosler where Murphy gets completely annihilated.
 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:56:21
Sterility means it doesnt produce anything. It isn't fruitful. 
Bitcoin does not represent real wealth bitcoin is just a number. Are numbers wealth?
You keep using words like 'financial freedom'. That is completely false. Bitcoin has so far provided financial freedom to a tiny few early adopters while tens of thousands are sitting on losses. Mathematically this *must* be the case. The bitcoin ecosystem also preys on people by encouraging addiction to vices via promotion of drugs, pornography, gambling and pump/dump boiler rooms. This atmosphere of slavery is needed to entice addicts into providing the fiat that large holders need.
Ive outlined this numerous times since bitcoin is a sterile asset it means that the real terms of trade *never change*. If I have 1k btc and you give me a car for it, no new wealth was added we simply swapped assets. If I want the btc back I have to give you the car back etc. Do you understand this?
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:03:19
All the wealth in the world was bought and paid for by labor. Adam Smith said that.
Labor remains the only method by which to value something. If it now takes me less time to buy the same goods/services as 80 years ago it means I am richer. This is what you have to focus on. 
Dollars are merely units of account for debts they are *not* wealth. This is the error this entire subreddit is persistently making.

Your statements are wrong.
The total amount of wealth in the world today is greater than the time of the gold standard. National currencies are merely units of account for debt. They are not meant to 'perform'. You know what performs? Human intelligence and human labor. That is why we have wealth. Did gold conjure up the computer you are typing to me with? Or code this messageboard we are using? Did gold 'perform' anything to write bitcoin code? No. Tell me did hoarding gold under your bed help with any of this? No.
Currencies are merely units of accounts that we use to *measure* debt. Think about that.
When you 'save' it means a business has less income. If business has less income they hire less, they research less, they reduce OUTPUT. This makes the entire economy poorer because they are not incentivized to figure out ways to more *efficiently* use resources.
Think about it if you hoarded all day would Apple as an example etc make anything? NO!
Infact the only way you can hoard yourself is if you have an INCOME to begin with meaning someone must be *spending*.
You are getting your economics from an ideology(Austrian school), not from what economics actually is. Spending = income at all times! Reducing income increases unemployment which reduces your own 'hoarding'. Replace the word income with spending now in the same sentence.
The bitcoin world is crowded with libertarians who are using Austrian school propaganda to fool many naive and misinformed people as a way to 'sell them' bitcoin. It provides the pseudo-intellectualism to sound smart.
The entire premise of production is to consume, it is not to hoard like some scrooge!

Taxes don't finance the government. Taxes are used to regulate the unemployment level. If the government taxes income it reduces spending in the economy which elevates unemployment. For the wealthy class its better to have a moderate level of unemployment to keep wages down and the value of their sterile bonds high.
Ask yourself you need dollars first before you can pay those taxes, so the government creates dollars when it spends them into existence. Does the government finance itself from tax? No. Why would the government need to take from you the very thing it issues?
We do not live in a fixed exchange rate or a commodity standard where money is scarce.

Lets look at observable fact we now have 9 years of it....
The total financial losses in the bitcoin space exceed any claimed benefits of the technology. VC losses alone are in the billions.

People who warned of extreme price declines(which occurred when bitcoin lost 85% of its value) were made out to be pariahs, attacked and downvoted at every instance.
This subreddit is constantly seeking something new that will propel the price, whenever that fails(for example Bitpay, Changetip) they ignore it as if it never happened. Quickly we find new things such as (segwit, sidechains) that will send the price to the moon.

The gold standard forced people to repay debts in higher value money this caused them to lose their farms and business's. Under deflation the price of money goes up meaning debts become harder to repay, add compound interest into the mix and you see an enormous transfer of wealth taking place into fewer and fewer hands. Bitcoin absolutely solves none of this and simply promotes the exact same thing. The utter majority of bitcoiners are bitcoin poor and spend their days giving all their paychecks to guys like Roger Ver.
Yes it is true that a single dollar buys less than before, but the total supply of dollars BUYS more than before. This is what matters. 
You are also completely digressing talking about wars(the worst of which existed precisely under a gold standard). It was the inherent deflation of gold that brought the world into trade wars and debt deflation which led to WW1 and WW2.
@_date: 2016-12-21 02:42:43
No that is not what I am claiming.
If the government has a public debt of lets say 100 billion that means the *private* sector has savings of 100 billion. The private sector is always a creditor. If you add the 2 sums up you get ZERO. On the governments books it has -100 while on private it has +100.
If you run a budget surplus you have to REDUCE the financial assets of the private sector. This is deflationary hence why everytime the US ran a balanced budget or close to one the economy fell into recession shortly after. Think of the Bill Clinton economy it ended in a bust because the budget surplus was draining money out of the economy and the private sector was running a deficit of something like 10% of gdp.
The private sector cannot run large deficits(borrowing) because eventually due to compound interest it will face a debt crisis. The government faces NO SUCH limitation because it is the sole issuer of the monetary unit.
This is why the US gov now has 20 trillion in 'debt' but the dollar is at 15 year highs and rallied even though the gov ran trillion dollar deficits. OIL is LOWER today than 2008 despite 4 trillion of QE and a Federal 'debt' of almost 2-3x the size. That alone should tell you something is wrong with your thinking. Where is 5k 10k gold?
Money is merely a measuring unit for debt! The dollar is equivalent to a 'meter' or a 'foot'. They are abstractions created by people to measure things.
Neoliberalism is merely a revival of rentier economics. Countries are indebted with deflationary money and then are told they must sell off their assets to private creditors while driving down wages(austerity). The end result is DEPOPULATION because families cannot afford to reproduce. This is why the western nations who adopt neoliberalism also *must* adopt open immigration. If you remove immigration from US GDP over the past 20-30 years it comes in at something like .5% per year, worse than any 'socialist' EU country....
Neoliberalism is literal economic suicide because over a longer time frame the labor force starts shrinking. Look at what happening in all 'austerity' countries!
I never claimed by adding more money you increase net *real wealth*. Real wealth comes from 1 simple formula. Credit(stored labor) makes contact with labor(present) to produce new wealth(surplus value). Understand that formula all wealth in the world is derived from it. The past makes contact with the present to produce what we need for the future! The question in economics is who gets that surplus value? In Neoliberalism its the creditor class while everyone else gets scraps.

Sorry but bitcoin has absolutely failed to live up to expectations. Much of the current rally has everything to do with altcoins failing even faster so some money is shifting over to bid on bitcoin.

I hate to remind this subreddit but 1800 btc per day X $770 means $500million+ per year is being drained by miners. Wheres the catalyst to provide that fiat? I don't know...
Bitcoin was a good run for those who got in early and are now living lavish lives at the expense of hordes of greedy neckbeards who are sitting on debts and capital losses.
I can see a scenario where an aged, poor and burned out Antonopolous is sitting at a bar no longer accepting bitcoin telling tales of the good days when he unwittingly shilled to make certain people rich.

In so called 'richer countries' everyone is burdened with private debts and are forced to repay them with declining real wages(deflation).
admits his own credit card debt was reduced by 75% in the span of a month due to high inflation.
Imagine in the United States if private debt was reduced by 75%? You would have a massive economic boom result.
The burden of private debt acts as a massive tax on consumption which reduces incomes and stagnates the economy. It only benefits those on the receiving end of the debt repayment namely the wealthy idle class.
Bitcoin is designed to benefit only those with large bitcoin balances the same way the present system benefits those with large dollar balances. If you aren't in that group then life sucks! It becomes a shitty grind as you compete for less and less income while your debt grows and grows and grows. Demographic collapse is the logical outcome of this hence the need for 'wealthy countries' to bring in immigrants.

The US dollar is not printed it is lent by either the government(deficit spending) or as private bank credit denominated in dollars.
Dollars are destroyed when you pay taxes(public) or pay debts(private).
It does not need to be physically linked to a sterile commodity. The dollar is a unit of account for DEBTs. If those debts are backed by productive human labor than the dollar will have value.
Why does the world save in dollars? No alternative exists, no government commands as powerful as a military nor as powerful of an economy.

Yes and see my post above.
The fiat money in your bank account came from all the bagholders who handed it to you in return for your bitcoin. Bitcoins price rise created the incentive for people to think they could all get rich quick. Of course mathematically that is impossible, you are part of the minority who got out with massive gains. Congrats! But remember where they came from, many many people are now in completely misery from the fiat losses(gains for you) they experienced. 
The dollars in your bank account are from the loans so many took out(remember dollars created when a loan is made) trying to get out ahead like you were able to do. So yes your gain is someone elses misery!
Welcome to bitcoin!

There is no evidence that any market reacts to news instantly. If it would price charts would be up and down straight lines, they aren't.
Bitcoin prices react to the passions and emotional whims of bitcoin sellers who are composed of 2 groups. Early adopters(whales) and miners.
Buyers in bitcoin are *always price takers* because they do not issue bitcoins. Bitcoin issuance to the market comes from the large stashes accumulated by whales early on and from miners mining.
You need to understand this dynamic if you want to understand bitcoin price movements.

You really are clueless.
You just said your debt went from $5k USD down to $1k USD. How is that a bad thing? For debtors it wipes the slate clean.
If you were on a bitcoin money system your debt would have increased this year by 80%(in dollars) *plus* interest charges. Your bitcoin denominated income would *decrease*. So the real value of the debt would burden you.
Of course hyperinflation is not good but plenty of economies have grown at double digit rates under 15-20% annual inflation because it reduces *debt*.
For example, Italy went from a backwater to nearly the size of Englands economy under a soft currency(higher inflation) and now back into total stagnation and decline under a hard currency(euro).
The primary reason for high inflation in Venezuela is government killing production and hoarding food/staples in warehouses. Sheer and utter incompetence and idiotic monetary policy(like pegging the currency in 2014).
In the US you have total stagnation in the economy due to the excessively strong dollar which means falling wages but growing debt. The Federal Reserve has been imitating a Gold Standard for the past 4 decades, this has devastated the US economy but benefited the wealthy class. 
Deflation is good if you are already *rich* but it is a horrible situation if you aren't. 
Who benefits most under bitcoin? Only those who are bitcoin rich.
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:25:06
In a fiat money system the natural rate of interest is ZERO. The federal reserve intervenes in the market place to lift rates higher then they otherwise would be. This is done to give wealthy creditors a 'risk free' asset so they can watch their sterile wealth multiple on its own.
Long term interest rates are a reflection of where the market thinks the short term feds funds rate will be in the future.
If the fed came out tomorrow and said zero interest rates are a permanent policy then the entire yield curve would flatten out to ZERO.

Gold has always been a terrible 'investment' because it produces nothing. If everyone just sat around hoarding gold the economy would look like India! A total SHITHOLE.
When an Iphone is being built its value increases a million % against a gold coin over the production time. Why? Because labor is being prudently applied to create new wealth(iphone). 
Gold represents the past. Its something that was previously mined out of the ground and now sits. Gold is great if you are rich *in the past* and want to be miserly and want to suck off new value people create, so you promote 'gold standard' deflation etc. By the way, don't you find it odd that the gold standard was forced upon the economy by a state yet it is supposedly promoted by 'freedom loving' anarchists? 
Bitcoin also represents the past. Previously mined value(coins) are suppose to swell up forever? So if we all just idle around staring at bitcoins wealth magically appears? Right....

Two problems.
1) What is the final demand? Ok, now that I have these bitcoins who is obligated to accept them? Ransomware victims?
2) Bitcoin is artificially scarce. What does this mean? It means to get bitcoin I must see if miners/early adopters are selling. This is an implied tax since they want the highest possible price and are able to restrict marketable supply.

The US political system is a complete and utter failure. The sheer examples are right before our eyes, we now worship sodomy and usury as virtues. 
People do NOT want freedom, they want security and stability. History is a testament to that statement. Democracy especially 'voting' completely overburdens mans ability to be able to know all the issues and use reason. Systems that survive are those that are anti-reason. Anything that argument puts up argument can pull down. Bitcoin is living proof of this. Bitcoin was suppose to fail ages ago because of reason. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:22:00
You don't understand what I am saying once again.
All the wealth in the world was produced through human labor. Surplus value(new wealth) only comes about from the application of labor to capital(stored labor). There is no other way to make new value unless you believe in MAGIC, which is what the majority of this subreddit professes(magic internet money).
Subjective value is just a theory of why something is valuable, it does not talk about where the value originates from. I'm not even talking about why something is valuable or isn't. Im stating observable fact, wealth can only be derived from human labor.
Bitcoin did not 'pay for the computer you are using'. Someone engineered and built it, the reason you have it is because party A gave you the fiat money for your bitcoin. The computer seller(party b) needed your fiat to either pay a debt obligation or trade it to someone who needs to pay one.
So the question is why did party A give you fiat for your bitcoin? Because they 'think it will go up' in the future. Hence bitcoin is used as an investment instrument even though it is completely sterile. It cannot produce wealth. This only benefits those with large bitcoin stashes(newly minted bitcoin oligarchs) who spout pseudo-economic theories as the rational justifying what its a wealth transfer mechanism.
People who are already rich want to 'preserve' their wealth while being IDLE. They want money to be artificially scarce to protect their holdings, this causes MISERY for those who are not wealthy as they have to enter the market to sell their labor for lower and lower levels or are forced to borrowing a shrinking supply of money.

No it hasn't. If you refer to tribal societies they were based on gift giving not on members 'making money'. Enriching yourself was seen at the expense of the tribe.

This is exactly why Bitcoin works because it is anything BUT a democracy. The rules are *rigid* and written in stone, bitcoin ownership highly concentrated and mining also highly concentrated. We absolutely do need an elite to rule over everyone else despite what the libertard anarchists want you to believe. The only question is what is the nature of that elite.
Nothing democratic has *ever* stood the test of time. It always devolves into pure tyranny because democracy is anti human nature. Humans want security and stability, they absolutely do not want the burden of freedom.

The core issue at the heart of bitcoin.
Should money be used as an investment vehicle?
Should everything be done to keep existing holders of bitcoin rich and protected by artificial scarcity.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:21:15
Neither bitcoin nor gold 'store value'. Value comes from people creating things through human labor.
If nobody is laboring to create new value there is *nothing* to buy. All the worlds wealth was bought and paid for by labor. Adam Smith recognized this in the beginning of wealth of nations but got carried off tangent.
Bitcoin and gold are promoted by vested interests who want to see their *sterile and idle* financial wealth swell up against real goods/services(deflation).
The same way a small % owns all the bitcoin, a small % owns all the gold. The reason 'gold standard' talk won't go away is from the billionaires financing these theories because they don't want to see their wealth potentially debased via inflation.
A functioning money system is *not a medium of exchange* nor a *store of value*, but merely a unit of account for debts. These units act as money in payment of debt both public(taxes) and private(bank debt).
Why should money be an investment vehicle that causes it to be artificially scarce(which stagnates the economy)?
This question has never been answered by any gold or bitcoin proponent. 
Folks. Money is sterile it does nothing. 
Prudent human activity(work) is fruitful. It's why you are now using this computer. Did bitcoin conjure it up? No. This subreddit needs a reality check from the ideological pseudo-economics fed into it.

If I cut the supply of mud pies in half do they double in value? No.
The simple fact that many many multiples more of gold ounces exist than bitcoins proves that scarcity alone does not give something value.
Bitcoin is more scarce than gold ounces yet the price remains lower.
171,000 tonnes of gold in the world @ roughly 29k troy ounces per tonne.
4.9 billion gold ounces in the world vs 15 million bitcoins. Yet the value of a bitcoin is 3/4ths of a single gold ounce.
This utterly disproves the theory of scarcity giving something value.
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:06:55
Bitcoin has no power of coercion, meaning no authority can make you accept bitcoin. This was the problem bitcoin early adopters faced(chicken egg problem). 'Bootstrapping' users. Anyone can create their own money, the problem is getting people to use it.
To solve this problem we have to understand the axiom ' Man has as many masters as he has vices.' 
Put it bluntly by encouraging the propagation of vice we can *coerce* people into bitcoin while at the same time claiming it is voluntary and freedom!
So early adopters *immediately* began by setting up ponzi schemes, gambling, pornography and price manipulation(rising price attracts get rich quick chasers). Once an enivironment(ecosystem) was setup we begin encouraging *addiction*. 
This delivers a near steady and constant stream of fiat. Nothing is as powerful as docile people hopelessly enamored with a delusion while completely *enslaved* to their passions.
Libertarianism is used as the ideology to justify the otherwise blatant immorality of these actions. It provides enough of intellectual cover to the point where the victims are out parroting its slogans.
Large bitcoin holders are now able to use bitcoin as a bank account, whenever they need to make a purchase they simply peel off units by selling them to the stream of morally bankrupt addicts.
So to this day we have a predatory ecosystem hence why nothing beneficial has come out of it. I also outline that bitcoin promotes slavery and *not* freedom.

A third party processor accepted your bitcoin because it was *instantly* sold for  US dollars. Congrats not only did you add a useless transaction to the blockchain, you also removed fiat money from an exchange.
Your bitcoins bought dollars which were than paid to your supplier. A middleman was used. You were better off directly paying in dollars instead of performing a useless transaction. 
Or just remove BTC from that equation? Bitcoin added zero value in this use case, hence the utter uselessness of this post.
If I sold my BTC for dollars and then spent those dollars at lets say Walmart, did walmart accept bitcoins? No.
Your supplier never had *any* interaction with bitcoin, he had interaction with paysion. He told you he never touched bitcoin.
Its also misleading to claim the fee was only 5 or 15 cents because paysion most likely charged their own direct fee or made money on the bid/ask spread. I mean how could the fee be 5 cents if multiple institutions were used in this transfer?
Are you one of those guys who just uses bitcoin for the sake of using it?

High interest rates lead to people selling off business and capital and just parking money in gov bonds. This is what happened under Volcker in US hence why the economy deindustrialized. 
Think about it.
Why would you bother running a business when your money grows by 20% compounded every year? High rates DEINDUSTRALIZE the economy. Understand this concept. Capital is liquidated and parked in bonds meaning everyone is poorer and inflation is higher(less goods).
You realize we have a fiat money system not gold or commodity? When you save all you are doing is saving in the governments liability(dollar)? How does that improve anything? It doesn't. The only way the economy can have a 'high savings rate' is if the government sector runs large deficits to provide the dollars the private sector saves in.
Also your bitcoin example is ridiculous. The total saved bitcoin *never changes* its always 21 million. All that occurs is ownership swaps of individual coins but the total saved bitcoin is always static. So how is having bitcoins improving your life? 
It fucking isn't. You still need to eat, sleep, entertainment, transportation. You know REAL wealth that someone has to produce via investment of labor.

No you aren't, you are speculating that someone comes along in the future and gives you more money for your bitcoins. No new wealth was created in this process just an asset swap. Yea you have $200 now and they have the bitcoin but if you wanted bitcoin back you would have to trade back the $200. 
The real terms of trade haven't increased. No new wealth!
People on here are totally clueless to asset price inflation being a zero sum game especially when dealing with a *sterile* asset like bitcoin. 
What people on here are expecting is a *neverending* stream of goods and services being offered to holders of bitcoin for lower and lower prices inperpetuity!
If even 3-4% of the bitcoins saved entered the market to be exchanged for actual money the price would collapse to single digits!

Its the opposite pal. Poor people suffer more as DEBTS become more difficult to service. Compound interest is what creates poverty.
Private debt owners want their money to multiple by itself via compound interest while ignoring the GRIND it places on those who are forced to pay the interest. They want a 'hard currency' because it protects their idle wealth. Bondholders want to be repaid in dollars that are worth more so they favor 'artificial constraints' against the economy to prevent 'overheating' and all sorts of pseudo-economics. Code words for restricting money. These are the theories that underpin bitcoin.
The bitcoin ecosystem is a microcosm of what an economy under bitcoin would look like. No investment, mass poverty, misery while the new oligarchs(Ver, Voorhees etc) 'invest' into casinos and drug dealing. No spending would occur because people would have a decreasing share of money. Just use bitcoin community as an example, everyone fucking each other over with scams.
My interpretation isn't hilarious, Italy had a soft currency(Lira) which kept spending high in the economy and fueled investment and growth. This led to an unprecedented scenario where Italy surpassed England, despite England having a substantial head start under every conceivable economic metric. Anglo-saxon economics have always been focused on 'fiscal conservatism' and 'sound money', lending at interest etc. Anglo-Saxon economics is focused on existing capital while completely ignoring where wealth comes from(human labor). This nonesense was imported into the Eurozone. Germany also a protestant state that emphasizes Calvin economics ends up impoverishing all of Europe just so frugal German misers can earn 7% a year in interest.

No in a fiat issueing system the government only needs to impose taxes to meet certain goals, lets say they want to reduce activities like landlord rents to make the economy more competitive so they tax that.
There is no reason to tax productive income  at all the government can always draw whatever resources it needs from the private sector by issuing its own money. The reason income is taxed now is to create unemployment in the economy which keeps wages down by scaring workers. This is great for bondholders and capital owners as they see a profit increase.
If you remove income from the economy you get unemployment and the best way of removing it is by taxing peoples paychecks via various deductions. 
I am not advocating socialism the exact opposite of it. The system you talk about 'individualistic capitalism' is socialism just for the wealthy group. I am opposed to *both*.

This is only good if you are a bitcoin early adopter for everyone else its bad.
If you are the guy selling products for BTC you income is consistently *decreasing*. So what happens if you had a bitcoin credit line that you used to finance your business? Well guess what you just owe 200% more real goods/services in order to repay your bitcoin denominated debt!
And just where did you borrow those BTC from? Well from the same early adopters of course. So now you have an effective interest rate of 200% because the price in BTC for your goods dropped by 80%. Your income has decreased but the debt has remained constant. Yep great news!
Over time in a theoretical bitcoin economy *all production* would be steered towards early adopters/hoarders while everyone else starves to death from a total dearth of money and is forced to resort to primitive barter.
Sales = income, so as sales decrease so does the expansion plans and hiring of the firm providing these services. End result is mass unemployment and mass idle capacity(look at all the BTC retailers going bust).
People on here just don't get it. Bitcoin is *sterile* it does not produce the food in that photo, someones labor does. People here like gold bugs want that new value to be transferred to hoarders of shiny coins or in the case of bitcoin prime numbers. I mean folks get out of your delusion, bitcoin is only good for the tiny few who have large stashes of it.

Poland is a disaster, people are earning $100 a week and 3 million fled the country. I have many friends from there and have also personally spent time there. Neo liberal economics after 27 years in Poland have led to a demographic collapse and its 'normal' for youth unemployment to be 20-30%.
High unemployment occurs when there is too little income in the economy. Its excellent for rich people who are able to rape the labor class since there are 50 workers for every 1 job opening.
In Poland average real estate costs 13x a workers salary making it one of the least affordable places in the world. You sir are a complete joke!
The only way you can save money is if the government is running a budget deficit. Government deficits = private sector savings. This is macro accounting 101.
Private debt is a different story because the private sector is not able to produce the dollars it needs to repay debt!
Debt crisis does NOT stem from public debt, it stems from PRIVATE debts. When the US government ran a balanced budget or came close to one the economy entered a recession shortly after because money was being drained out of the economy through that very process! Deficits add money while balancing removes it. It was the 'free market' and private sector that collapsed in 2008 in the US.
By the way Poland also 'gave away' everything to private hands hence why certain guys are billionaires there while the average worker takes home $5-7k a year despite productivity being at 80% of Western EU.
Neoliberalism is responsible for the wrecked economies globally but sure put all the blame on government pal!

Credit cards were brought into the system as a way to substitute for falling wages. Wage growth had peaked and in order to convince the dumb public their standard of living wasn't falling the CC was introduced.
Regardless of that it is now the information age and adoption occurs multitude faster.
You simply do not get it. People don't 'adopt bitcoin' becuase why should they? In order to get into bitcoin which is an inclusive club, you need to pay an early adopter or a miner a *high* price and continuously bid up this price. This is the hidden tax which completely prevents mass adoption.
The only reason bitcoiners on here want 'mass users' is for the price to go off the charts making them filthy rich from transferring wealth from newcomers. Dude. This will not happen outside of coercion.
So what do early adopters do? Simple they invest in projects that get people *addicted* to various vices via passions and emotions. Gambling, pornography, drugs. What do they all have in common? ADDICTION. Which ensures a steady stream of fiat bidding on bitcoin. Manipulating the environment to create addiction is a form of *coercion*.

You are completely clueless and so was Friedman. Monetarism is exactly the reason we've had private debt bubbles. 
Moneterism has been thoroughly debunked and is absolutely to blame for the ridiculous economic policies of the last 30 years which have impoverished country after country while making a tiny % filthy rich.
The government creates money everytime it spends it into circulation. This is fact. When the government deficit spends it adds income into the economy, when it taxes it removes income. Profit growth CANNOT exist unless the government is adding money into the economy. 
Every single time the government runs a surplus or a balanced budget a recession follows shortly after. Look at Clinton running a surplus(removing money from economy) followed quickly by dotcom collapse.
The government must spend first than tax after. You cannot pay taxes with something you don't first have. Taxes are used to drive demand for money, they do *not* finance the government. 
Hyperinflation only occurs when there is a massive production disruption in the economy. All examples in history say this is always the case. In Zimbabwe farm production collapsed by 70% because the government gave farm land to soldiers who had no idea how to work it. In Weimar Germany all the industry was given to France, so German production collapsed while they continued to print money to buy foreign currency to repay war debt.
If the economy is operating at 100% meaning all resources are fully employed and government keeps spending then yes under this situation you would have high inflation. However with plunging worker participation rates and underemployed resources everywhere you look we are in the opposite scenario.
Monetarism is absurdity because it assumes that money itself is wealth. It is not.
Volker imployed moneterist theories and inflation did not stop until he wrecked the entire economy with the worst recession since the great depression. The US economy has never fully recovered to this day from what Volcker did. US manufacturing was absolutely destroyed by monetarist policy which raised interest rates to near 20% making it impossible for capital intensive business to be able to refinance loans. Speculators were able to capitalize on this with leveraged buy outs where they liquidated companies.
I suggest you educate yourself pal.
All tax policy has been left over from the days of fixed exchange rates(gold standard). We have a totally different money system(free floating fiat exchange) so many monetary theories(Austrian) simply DO NOT apply to what we have. This is why the monetarists/Austrians were ALL WRONG when it came to hyperinflation from QE.

Then why do all the 'freemarket' libertarians only invest into gambling, porn, shady exchanges in this space? Are those moral and efficient?
The 'free market' is all about imposing rents on people. Nobody wants to take risks they want to offload risks and that's what the so called free market does. It is anything but free. It imposes rents that add no value to the economy.
The free market hasn't given us anything. Take out an Iphone and take it apart every single bit of tech inside came from public financing. 
Look use bitcoin ecosystem as the example.
What were early adopters all investing in? Things that promote VICE and addiction so they keep getting a steady stream of fiat. Shady exchanges, gambling, porn, promoting drug markets.
Coincidence? Those are all low risk investments that deliver high returns because they provide a permanent stream of victims.

The total saved bitcoin = total mined bitcoin. So because 90% of bitcoins in circulation are in the hands of maybe 100-200 people, in a bitcoin economy there would be no sales occurring unless these people 'spent' their bitcoin.
Sales = Income. Someones sales are another persons income. The absolute vast majority would be essentially stuck in a deflationary economy where they would have to keep driving their own prices down that includes wages to compete for the remaining pool of bitcoins.
If more goods/services are produced the beneficiaries would be guys like Ver who just idle around and watch his stash swell in value *that other people create*.
People producing goods/services would essentially have little to no income unless the oligarchs decide to spend. This would mean staggering unemployment and poverty. Precisely what occurred under gold standard money. 'Gilded Age'
Under the present fiat system rich people want the government to run a 'balanced budget' to starve the economy of money and lead to the same scenario that way people are forced to borrow private credit which eventually leads to a deflationary collapse due to compound interest(2008). If you study economic history(which was removed from US universities in 1972) you will see the biggest opposition to fiat money comes from very rich people.
Do you understand these concepts? Bitcoin money is excellent if you already have a ton of them. Its horrible if you have to 'work' for bitcoin because your wages go down while your debts in real terms get larger.

Actually its the opposite.
Fiat --&gt; Bitcoin early adopter/Miner.
Holding encouraged so those newly bought bitcoins dont re enter the market and deplete fiat order books.
The total supply of saved bitcoins = total mined bitcoins. Its always the same.
The reason bitcoin buying is actively encouraged is because 90% of the supply is held by maybe 200 people. So you are directly financing their lifestyle.
All the major exchanges are controlled by early adopters so they are able to see how much fiat is available and what price rise the market will tolerate.

Why do bit-coiners always thwart a conversation to comparisons with the 'legacy' fiat system? Where did I bring up banks?
Once again you did not address a single one of my points.
One. You don't 'make' money just holding bitcoin. Until you've swapped your bitcoin for something there is no gain. That 'gain' only comes from someone willing to give you more financial wealth(fiat) than you spent acquiring the bitcoin in the first place.
From an outside observer if I have $100 dollars and you have 1 BTC and we swapped, *nothing* has changed. No new wealth has been created. Price is a ratio. This is always the case. No matter what price you sell your bitcoin for(or vice versa I buy it for) an ownership change merely occurred.
Now where does demand(bids) for bitcoin come from? There are 2 sources. Since bitcoin has no final demand, meaning nobody is obligated to accept bitcoin for the payment of anything, bitcoin acceptence therefore comes two fold. One as a *conduit* to get fiat money because other systems aren't available, this is the classic case of the darkmarkets. It is absolutely false that darkmarkets accept bitcoin because of some superiority to fiat, they accept bitcoin as a way to obtain fiat. Prices and final settlement is always denominated in fiat.
So does the bitcoin/blockchain have a use case? Yes absolutely. Is a unit of bitcoin sterile? Yes. Can it produce wealth. No.
This is where the second case comes in. Bitcoin as a tool to transfer financial wealth from a large group of people into a smaller one.
The second case is by enticing users through the outright promotion of vice. One of the easiest being *avarice*, people are told of untold riches and potential investment returns if they buy bitcoins. Pseudo-economics is brought in here to explain away and justify this. Absolutely no different than the pseudo-economics in the mainstream that openly praises and justifies rentier economics, or the absurdities of the Austrian school in their worship of gold coins.
If you also notice all sorts of other vices are actively promoted in this space. The question is why? Because someone who is addicted to vice is a complete slave who is easy to manipulate. This is the ideal bitcoin consumer for early adopters/large hoarders. It guarantees a *perpetual* supply of fiat to bid bitcoin up. 
Bitcoin pumping allows the financing of an outrageously lavish lifestyle not just in terms of conspicuous consumption but also of real investments for a tiny minority.
For bitcoin early adopters with large hoards, there is an absolute vested interest to promote 'sophisticated' theories and explanations to an audience devoid of any morality, one that completely lacks the moral vocabulary to even be able to use reason, nevermind understanding it. The growth of this audience is what the buzzword 'adoption' defines.

Yes. The gold standard was *forced* upon the economy by the bank of england, this resulted in decades of deflation and credit crisis which ultimately ended with the end of the British empire itself. 
Please read your history. The most successful monetary system in history have always been based on fiat credit, in England it was the 1000 year tally-stick system under which England became an empire. They seized being an Empire under the gold standard. Coincidence? No. Fixed money always brings about deflation and poverty which leads to reactions such as trade wars and war itself. 
Look we can sit here and reason all we want about money, I'm talking about observable fact. Money has always had the halmark of authority, there is no evidence anywhere that this has not been the case.
The barter theory of money rests on no historical evidence whatsoever. 
Bitcoin is infested with an ideology that is loaded with utter falsehoods because it sounds good. It attempts to ignore reality so the vested interests continue milking the sheep.
There is no mechanism that stops thousands of altcoins from inflating the total market cap of crypto thereby limiting bitcoin *price* gains. We saw this happen even in 2013 when litecoin at one point was 10% of btc, meaning that a billion in market cap was siphoned off bitcoin.
Today the same case is true. Roughly 20% of total crypto market cap sits in other altcoins. Lets assume this was not the case, ideally bitcoins price would be roughly $800 now. The higher bitcoins market cap goes the more liquidity leaks into altcoins because why the fuck wouldn't it? What does bitcoin do that litecoin doesn't? Nothing.

Outside the moral order there can be no progress and this applies to bitcoin as well. We have an ecosystem where fraud, theft, gambling and overall degeneracy is praised and that is exactly why despite years of pumping no good bitcoin related firms exist. Infact the price is 1/4th lower today than 3 years ago. If that isn't total failure of expectations than I don't know what is. 
Think this through. Outside the moral order there can be NO progress. All economic activity must be subordinated to a higher order or else it ends in disaster.
Libertarians cannot point to an anarchy based society because none has ever lasted. Why? It goes against human nature. Evil is apart of human essence so an authority must exist to keep this in check. Libertarians assume humans are 'inherently good'. That is absolutely false and history has shown this falsehood to be the case. Look at the bitcoin ecosystem as a microcosm, what do the so called libertarians like Voorhees and Ver do? Immediately engage in predatory behavior for self benefit.

I don't think you understood what I said.
If interest rates are very high people liquidate capital. They sell business and factories and park the money in treasury bills. Think about it, what business can earn 20% *compounded*? None. This is what occurred under Paul Volcker he basically killed the US economy and weve never really recovered since.
The russian economy is dead for the same reason they panicked as oil prices fell and took a playbook from the West because its all they know. Ruble fell so the central bank raised interest rates to like 15-20% this has *killed* Russian business and stoked high inflation. It did the exact opposite of what was suppose too happen.
People have this strange fixation believing that money itself constitutes wealth so they want to do everything they can to preserve the *value* of it. It really makes no sense whatsoever if you think it through. Money is *not* wealth. 
On your Mcdonald comment. 100% of SP500 companies can easily afford to give their workers large wage increases but they choose to buyback their own shares or pay more dividends to already rich shareholders who just hoard the money.
As wealth accumulates into fewer and fewer hands thanks to Austrian/libertarian economics the economy stagnates because demand falls and people are forced into debt just to live.
Economic stagnation outside of war is *always* the result of some sort of deadweight draining aggregate demand. In our case it happens to consist of a few hundred billionaires who want their wealth to compound at rates faster than the economy so everyone else must get poorer.
Outside of the moral order there can be no progress.

Guo inadvertently explains exactly why bitcoin cannot go to millions.
*Nothing* stops the creation of altcoins and nothing stops liquidity from flowing into those altcoins.
Why do all Americans accept US dollars and not Euros or Yuans or Yen? Simple. Government coercion. The government only accepts its own scrip in payment of taxes. You need dollars to extinguish your tax liability. You cannot settle your tax bill in any other unit of account.
Folks. We have 6000 years of monetary history to prove that *coercion* drives money. There is absolutely no evidence that money arose spontaneously out of barter and that 'we all give it value'. No, government coercion gives money value, plain and simple. Every coin dug up from thousands of years ago had the imprint of a state authority on it.
Guo is all upset that people in the crypto space keep wandering off to other coins instead of giving all their money to him and his farm. We have 8 years of crypto markets to prove the simple fact that altcoins increase the *total* supply of crypto.
If we had a bitcoin only world where 100% of market cap was bitcoin than the price would already be $100 higher. 
Sorry people, without a coercive authority bitcoin will never be more than a niche instrument used by certain actors as a conduit to get fiat money(final settlement).

The difference is Nvidia actually produces something and has sales. I can still collect dividends from Nvidia even if the share price is volatile. Nvidias rising earnings add net wealth. Nvidias earnings come from producing computer hardware. New wealth is added to the system.
Bitcoin well does nothing. In a bitcoin world all 'gains' are someone elses 'losses'. There can be no other way.
If I bought at $200 and sold at 1k. Where did that 1k come from? From the buyer of BTC or vice versa the seller of dollars.
I now have dollars but no bitcoin, the other party has the opposite. There has been *no* change in real wealth just a swap of 2 things. If we sit around flipping bitcoin at various prices, nothing ever changes. Someone either has dollars or bitcoins. No new wealth is ever added.
Because the ownership of bitcoins is concentrated in so few hands, these 'hodlers' have an incentive to promote bitcoin because ultimately they need the fiat money from new bidders. Without people willing to give them fiat, the bitcoins themselves are worthless. All the capital gains in bitcoin go to maybe 0.05% of total users. The best way to get new fiat onboard is to promote an environment that encourages addiction to *vice*. This ensures a steady stream of fiat income is always ready to bid on hodler coins.
Capital gains in bitcoin is an absolute misleading term as well. Capital gain implies value was added, where as in bitcoin as I outlined above, nothing is added.

Bitcoin is the same level as 3 years ago.
Those who bought at levels 700+ had to wait 36 months and endure a drawdown of nearly 80% before the current rebound.
In that same time frame multiple wars broke out and multiple economic problems emerged. No bitcoin does not protect you from geopolitical risks.
Infact no evidence exists that bitcoin protects you from anything. A bitcoin buyer is exposed to a constant risk of early adopters(whales) deciding to cash out. This was evidenced by 'bearwhale'. Why should a collection of numbers protect you from crisis? In crisis you need perishables and guns.

1) People being lured in by conartists(early adopters) into thinking they will get rich fast.
 2) People using it as a conduit to get fiat money because the state blocked their ability to get it. Think darknet.
So bitcoin only has useage due to avarice and state coercion against its competitors.

No in a deflationary system your wealth does not grow. Someone has to be producing wealth for it to even exist. People only invest and produce if they think they will have a future income. Spending = income.
Business does not hire people nor innovate if it does not assume rising sales. That is fact. Sales come from spending NOT from hoarding money.
Saving financial assets like money does *nothing*. You are confusing saving real wealth with saving nominal wealth(money). Money is not wealth!

No that exactly what it is. The 'bankers' haven't been able to find a use case for it because none exists. Like what interpretation is there?
Fiat banking = private decentralized double-entry bookeeping entries that keep track of debts and are denominated in a common currency(dollar) which copies are not distributed to everyone.
99% of the money in existence is in the form of private bank IOU's from thousands of different institutions. Isn't this exactly what libertarians want?
Blockchain = transparent *centralized* ledger that employs single entry accounting to keep track of no ones liabilities denominated in a common unit(bitcoin) whose copies are distributed among anyone who wants one.
Bitcoin has no final demand, its just a collection of liabilities that belong to no one. Like if I have $100 in my bank account, someone else has -$100. It always equals out to zero, in bitcoin if I have +100 btc, then what? It isn't backed by a corresponding asset.
People on are clueless to what double entry bookeeping means and what credit money is.

The government is a large net payer of interest, rising interest rates increase income paid to the economy.
QE removed money by reducing outstanding bonds. The Fed removed something like 100billion in interest so that why you had the strong dollar the entire time.

Yes they are 'hard currencies'. Greenspan said himself that the Federal Reserve must act as if a gold standard existed. This means limiting access to money and forcing the economy to go into debt to the private banking sector.
Greenspan's policies are what led to the massive wealth transfer in the economy. He treated money as if it were WEALTH itself by artificially imposing *rents* on the economy(compound interest). Greenspan absolutely despised the working class he made this clear in numerous speeches and now advocates robbing pension funds.
The government reduces money by taxing it out of your paycheck, thereby reducing potential purchasing power. People then go to banks to borrow for what they need to live(mortgages for shelter, credit cards) etc. 
Under libertarianism whenever the private sector engages in rent seeking behavior by taxing you via interest, rent, fees its absolutely justified. They do not want the government interfering in a certain class of people getting richer.
The Fed acts in the interest of the creditor class to protect the purchasing power of their idle bonds by making money difficult to obtain. 
Yes you are correct in a proper functioning economy people would not need to be dependent upon usurious debt and grinded by compound interest.

I take my paycheck and give it to one of 2 bitcoin sellers. Either a mining farm or an early adopter cashing out.
I now have bitcoin. *crickets*
How exactly have my real terms of trade improved? Do the bitcoins produce anything that gives me pleasure or utility? No. 
I now stare at sterile numbers counting on someone else in the future to give me more of their government numbers. Ok great.
So why would a sane person participate in this? The answer is they wouldn't. 
Early adopters simply created an environment that promotes *addiction* to various vices. Greed, gambling, drugs, porn, ponzi schemes. This is the magnet that attracts the fiat. People who are addicted to vice are the easiest to manipulate and convince into handing over their money. You ever wonder why drug markets were marketed as providing 'freedom'? Umm you ever meet a drug addict that is actually free?
All these buzzwords are just explanations to lure in more fiat bidders which allow miners and early adopters to live lavish lifestyles.

Bitcoin is designed to encourage hoarding so velocity will always be low until the price starts cratering and people rush to get rid of their coins. Look when transactions tick up the most its when bitcoins are losing value. 
Your statements are meaningless. What do you mean a 'good type' of inflationary effect? All spending carries with it inflationary risk irrelevant where the spending comes from. Prices denominated in bitcoin have days where they increase by 10-20% in 24hrs, would that not be a case of hyperinflation?
Bitcoin experiences bouts of hyperdeflation and hyperinflation making it completely unusable for anything but hoarding.

Adam Smith never created libertarianism. He was an apologist for the Whig looters of his time. I also never said Jews 'invented' libertarianism. If you read Adam Smiths works he said the basis for all wealth is human labor not gold or shekels. Compared to what libertarians preach, Adam Smith would be considered a socialist today.
Yes libertarianism is absolutely dominated by Jewish intellectuals, the same way communism was.
Murray Rothbard, Ludwig Von Mises, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, David Ricardo, Julian Simon ....
A disproportionate amount of the libertarian 'movement' is also pro-israel even if it completely contradicts their 'none-aggression principle'. 
Remember Greenspan was an absolute disciple of Ayn Rand, he ran the Fed on the basis that bonds were gold. Greenspan also famously said its fine that the population is drowning in debt because it prevents them from asking for wage hikes since they are too afraid of losing their job.
If you want to understand the monetary basis for Bitcoin than read Rothbard's book on money. He basically wants his gold shekels to swell in value at the expense of everyone else. It is one of the most crude understandings of monetary theory.

I thought bitcoin was suppose to eliminate all these middle men? And now you are admitting bitcoin needs middle men to 'reduce business complexity and cost'? 
The problem is bitcoin 'payment processors' dont process bitcoin payments they are just 1 way exchanges. They sell bitcoin for fiat and than hand the FIAT over to the merchant. They are not processing bitcoin denominated assets and settling in bitcoin. Once again here we are in bitcoin land with a term 'payment processing' that has been co-opted from its common sense meaning. Bitpay/Coinbase are glorified 1 way exchangers that are pumped by this community in order to give the allusion of large scale bitcoin adoption.

In a fiat monetary system the natural rate of interest is zero. Why? Because as banking reserves pile up they drive down bond yields.
The job of the fed for the past 40 years has been to keep interest rates *too high*. Its the exact opposite of what austrian economist clowns have been saying.
The fed intervened in the market to keep rates excessively high which led to a massive wealth transfer from producers(entrepreneurs,business,labor) to usurers(bondholders).
The economy reached stagnation because too much income was being transferred to bondholders. We have a scenario unprecedented in history because there is both an excess of money at one end of the economy and a derth in the other.
Now they know this and are attempting to 'tax' bondholders with large balances by draining them in order to force them into spending or investing their idle and sterile nominal wealth. Will it work? Probably not.
The only solution to the economic malaise facing the majority of the world is a fiscal policy of increasing disposable income for 90% of the populace while also promoting PRO-FAMILY policies, so that income is invested into the next generation. We don't need anymore impulsive shoppers and people obsessed with themselves. If this doesn't occur then debt deflation will be completely unavoidable as a result of massive population ageing.

I did read it and its wrong. If we had a pure gold standard 98% of the population would be in poverty as economic activity would be entirely dependent on those who hoard gold. Look at the bitcoin ecosystem as a case study, all economic activity would depend on guys like Roger Ver. Look what they 'invest' in, casinos and exchanges. This is precisely what occured under the gold standard, the rich would invest into moneylending and through deflation drive entire industries out of work. You had gilded mansions surrounded by mass poverty. 
Why do you think hard money persists to this day? Its promoted by wealthy oligarchs not by the masses as libertarians falsely want you to believe. Read economic history of the US.
One of mankinds greatest economic achievements is financing a 70 trillion per year global economy *without* the use of a physical commodity. 
Why should someone who hoards money in the past be rewarded for what people invest for and produce in the future just because?
Money is sterile my friend on its own it is completely worthless. Artificial scarcity of money puts a huge tax on the economy as everyone is forced to perpetually reduce their pricing. Because debts are not reduced as fast it ultimately leads to bankruptcy.
Money has also always been credit based, produce the evidence of money arising as a commodity from barter, it doesn't exist. It was English libertarians who *forced* the economic system of the world onto gold, it did not spontaneously arise.

The government redeems your dollars when you pay taxes. What happens with them? They get erased.
Think about it from a double entry book keeping standpoint.
On the governments side they show a liability, on your side its an asset.
When you hand back the IOU the liability(asset) vanishes.
Your post tax income is used as currency because someone else in the economy needs it to repay private debt and tax debt. Do you understand what drives demand for the scrip? People need it to pay debts! The scrip is not a commodity it is merely a unit of account of debts! The problem comes when people start treating it as having value in and of itself and force artificial monetary scarcity onto the economy in order to 'protect' the purchasing power of creditors.
Bitcoin has *no final demand*. Nobody absolutely needs it to settle any debt! If demand wanes for bitcoin no mechanism is in place to also reduce supply. 
Taxes regulate demand in the economy, if taxes are too high(like now) there is an artificial shortage of money circulating. This creates unemployment which reduces wages. At the same time it also sends people to look for money from private borrowers. Think of what happened in 2000-2007! 
Unemployment is used as policy tool to keep wages low thereby creating deflation in the economy. Deflation benefits the creditor class! It also forces the economy to underperform potential output. Pull up an output chart for the US!
Government policy absolutely determines the level of unemployment in an economy. Greenspan said this himself when he claimed high private debt is excellent because it keeps workers terrified from asking for a raise. Rising salaries debase the income of bondholders! When you understand this youll understand the political crisis at the heart of US society(debtors vs creditors). This is the conflict on going since 1776!

Because bitcoin is designed to be hoarded the amount of transactions will be too low to maintain the mining network unless technology advances rapidly.
The most likely scenario is a massive decline in hashrate as both early adopters and miners move onto something else and bagholders are left holding onto millions of bitcoins wondering what the heck to do with them.

Some good points but you failed to mention that a certain % of government budget goes towards welfare payments to the rich via INTEREST. Interest is basically a welfare stipend for rich people who hold the bonds.

The total amount of dollars today buys MORE goods and services than 60 years ago. Are you going to deny that statement? 
First off dollars are merely a unit of account for debt. If you increase nominal debt through prudent spending than more goods and services exist in the economy. Think about it, spending = income. The worlds wealth is *not* fixed as most deluded austerity Austrians would want you to think. 
Prices declining as a result of efficiencies are one thing, prices declining because demand is collapsing due to high levels of debt is something completely different! 
The government does not 'print money'. How many times are you people going to repeat that absurdity. 99% of money in existence is in the form of private bank deposits competing in the so called 'free market'. The government has done nothing but nurture the 'free market' for decades and the results have been disasters. 
Dollars are *not* a commodity, they are units of account of debt! Stop repeating Austrian economics whose theories were formed when the majority of the world used commodity money(gold), we use credit money. Think of the government as a large double entry bookeeping bank!

Then the value of fiat will go to zero.
Fiat money only has value because someone needs to fillful their obligations(debt) either to private creditors or to the government. Someone in the economy is always seeking out money to repay debt.
What would be truly revolutionary is if we had a P2P credit system based on blockchain bookkeeping. But that requires a way of vetting reputation and trust, both of which are completely lacking in the bitcoin space.
Think about it logically for a second. If the economy were to collapse tomorrow the last thing on peoples minds will be bitcoin or gold coins, goods that ensure survival become defacto money. Bitcoin also requires a sophisticated infrastructure consisting of electricity, internet, devices etc to even function.
So far the P2P bitcoin economy consists of early adopters enticing us to play in their casinos.

Its true that a single dollar has lost purchasing power overtime but the total amount of dollars buys MORE than ever before. Think about that statement for a bit.
Your money can only 'go up' in time if goods and services that are produced now go down over time. Think about that. The only way bitcoins can rise in value is if someone is willing to exchange more production for them. Why would they do that? Oh yea, if further easy riches are promised *or* if they are forced too by the state like what happened with the gold standard.
Yea that guy in 2011 took no risk, the guy buying in 2016 is taking all the risk, thats how wealth transfer works pal.
Adam Smith never proposed the 'freemarkets' theory, you are acting as if before Adam Smith no markets existed. Adam Smith seperated economics from moral philosophy. He said you don't need moral constraints because the 'invisible hand' will take care of everything. Well yea, that sure worked out great! Adam Smith essentially set back economics.
Smith was an apologist for the Whig oligarchy in England at the time who made their fortune looting monasteries a generation earlier. All modern english economic theory has its roots in providing a justification for theft! Look what followed Smith with the British empire etc. At its core Anglo-Capitalism begins and ends with theft. Once fortunes are accumulated via stealing(public property), they are then lent out at compound interest which inevitably brings about debt deflation and the creditors then begin looting pensions, public property etc. This is the cycle that we are currently living through but its nothing new if you study anglo-capitalist history.
Smith definitely made very good points and was right about many things but he got carried away and totally missed the big picture(due to his Whiggery). Libertarianism roots lie in liberalism whose roots lie in the protestant reformation. All protestant nations carry the libertarian disease to a certain extent.

Unfortunately the 'shared delusion' is not based on anything in reality. Money did *not* arise from barter. There is no historical evidence that supports this view. If you have it, care to produce it? Because I can show you money from as far as Mesopotamia bearing the mark of some authority.
When people take bitcoin they immediately look at its *dollar* price. 
I explained why bitcoin is accepted, because it can be exchanged for fiat. It is used as a conduit to get fiat because access to fiat transfer mechanisms is restricted for whatever reason. It's as simple as that. If there was no way to exchange bitcoin for fiat, it's value would be zero. You'd have to find someone willing to exchange a physical good/services directly for btc. Good luck with that. 
I will always find someone willing to exchange me X for dollars though because I know debts are denominated in dollars. This is what I mean by *final demand*. 
There is no evidence of this monetary collective delusion existing. If bitcoin has value because we give it value, why don't we logically value it at millions per dollar? People accept dollars because the government takes dollars in payment of taxes. People accept bank transfers because the banks accept their own IOU's in payments of debt. It really is that simple. Dollars are constantly created(debt expansion) and constantly destroyed(debt repayment,debtdefault).
The money system is elastic with a tendency towards inflation. Why? Because much of the spending ends up being wasteful. So dollars expand while goods/services don't. However the total amount of dollars in the world buys more goods than ever before. 
The role of a money issuer is to ensure there is enough in the economy to meet spending needs. That's it. In an ideal world an economy like the US would have multiple currencies at a more localized level. This decentralization would bring about booming economies while completely curbing the power of the federal government(which has been coopted to serve the interests of a tiny few). The centralized control of currency has given rise to a tyranny of a minority over the majority. So I am not a statist whatever that means.

Yes there is. Money is a credit instrument used to settle debts. Commodities are used as inputs for the production of higher order goods.
Bitcoin is not money because it has no *final demand*. Do you understand this concept? There is nobody obligated to take back bitcoins in the payment of anything. Miners do not have to take bitcoins back.
With fiat money the government must take back the money in payment of taxes. This is what drives currency. Fiat currency is an IOU of the government which is redeemed when you pay taxes. Secondary demand comes from private debt being denominated in the governments IOU creating a demand in the economy as an economic actor is always in debt so searching for dollars to repay it.
Bitcoin has none of those characteristics. It is a artificially scarce unique combination of digits that have value only to the extent that someone wants to trade fiat for them. In and of itself bitcoin is a barter token. A barter economy is always less efficient and more primitive than a credit based one. A barter economy requires next to no trust so there can be no sophisticated transactions taking place.
What is bitcoin used for? Bitcoin is primarily used for as a conduit to get fiat money by those actors who cannot get fiat money using legacy means. If bitcoin had no exchange rate with fiat money it would have absolutely no value. No direct trade of merchandise for bitcoin occurs, everything is priced in fiat with intended settlement in fiat. Ask a silk road drug dealer or a fraudster, they will all tell you they intend to trade their bitcoins away for fiat and they price in fiat.
What bitcoins do not understand is it is the actions of the state that are creating demand for bitcoin. By restricting the useage of legacy fiat, you get demand flowing into stuff like cryptocurrency. Ultimately the Roger Ver's of bitcoin need to be grateful to the state for making them rich.
If demand falls for bitcoin(inflation) there is no mechanism to remove excess supply to respond accordingly.

Credit based monetary systems are exactly what develop naturally and organically. Credit implies mutual benefits, hard money benefits only the creditor at the expense of the debtor. Libertarian economics is exactly what we've had in the west for the past 30 years since Reagan/Thatcher. Look what happened, the moneylenders looted all they could while those who work for a living saw their wage power evaporate. 
Can you produce a single example of a successful libertarian experiment or society? Lets look at the grotesque state of the bitcoin community where nobody can be trusted. Outside the moral order there can be no progress.
Deflation implies the price of money is *rising*. Are you now saying that money itself produces value on its own? So you believe in alchemy aka magic?
Deflation crushed farmers in the United States in the late 1800's they went on to form the Populist party, something you rarely hear about even in school history textbooks.
After US civil war, northern usurers like Lehman Brothers descendend on the South and indebted all the farmers via furnishing agents. Nobody could pay the debts back because prices kept *falling* due to deflation from a scarcity of gold. Lehman's first fortune was made on seizing indebted properties.
Look what happening now in Europe with deflation and austerity that is imposed by force. 
Fixing loans to deflation or inflation is absurd because how exactly can you predict the future outward? You can't.

The bitcoin ecosystem like all libertarian utopias promote slavery to vice(passions). Why? because it benefits the wealthier portion of the group to have a huge army of gullible idiots enslaved to their passions and giving them money none stop. So that is why they come up with great theories like 'freedom of choice', consensual etc. Ask any drug addict how 'free' he is. Look what bitcoin early adopters all promoted, drug useage and gambling and this subreddit also addiction to porn. Guess what? The top of the pyramid gets paid $$$ from serving the endless demand. man has as many masters as he has vice! Ever wonder why the elite also promote sexual debauchery amongst the populace. They took this concept and flipped it on its head....
If an economic system is not subjugated to moral law it devolves into oligarchic anarchy where nobody trusts nobody.

Because its easier to get BTC than it is to sell it after especially in large quantities! Even if they are holding 10 20 30% its enough to remove supply from order books and therefore increase the price. Remember supply is mainly coming from miners as they must sell in order for bitcoin users to have coins to use and to cover their own expenses. 
Predicting bitcoin price is simple, supply remains static so we have to focus on demand. Ransomware is a booming industry period. Do you see any other catalyst that has brought demand for bitcoin in 2016. NO. Bitcoin enthusiasts are too poor to afford supply the mining network with money to cover their expenses, if enthusiats were the only ones involved here we would never have gotten out of the gpu mining stage. Remember spending drives investment into hashrate! More spending more hashrate more secure network more trust in bitcoin.
Buying bitcoin is essentially a call option on more cybercrime! This is the trade that everyone missed. Cybercrime massive growth industry and holding bitcoins lets you be apart of that legally. Ransomwhere will dwarf anything we have seen so far in crypto. Think of bitcoin as the currency of the internets pirate coves!

The government sets the nominal rate. 1 US Dollar = 1 US dollar.
When you say USD crashes, against what specifically?
Look, economic actors need dollars because they have debts to pay. Those debts are both private(banks) and taxes(public). To get dollars these actors have to offer XYZ in the marketplace. It really is as simple as that.
The fiat money system is a book keeping system of IOU's. Yes it is true that a single dollar has lost purchasing power over time, but the total supply of dollars buys more goods and services than ever before. Think about that one.
Systems like bitcoin put an excess focus on economic activity that occurred in the past and excessively seek to reward someone just because they hoard digits. I'm sorry but will hoarding digits produce you food, electronics, cars, vacations, the very computer you are now using? Or provide you with the internet? The answer is quite obviously no. So who should get what is produced? The miser who hoards or the people actually laboring to make nice things appear? 
I don't know? Maybe you know that answer. Maybe we should revert back to primitive barter(as bitcoiners promote)? More simple living? I'm just pointing out some reality, bitcoin represents economic regression.
I understand your argument about the excess of tax money going to zero. Look a proper system is based on trust in its institutions. So we can say a credit based monetary system works on trust. Well what does trust need? It needs prudence! What is prudence? A moral virtue. So  the higher degree of morality the more sophisticated the economy can be. It really is that simple. What we have now in the world is a total lack of moral order, thereby a total lack of trust. Does bitcoin solve any of this? No. Bitcoiners attempt to do away with moral philosophy by claiming computer code and 'math' will solve it. Just like the free market guys told us occultist invisible hands will do it! 
It simply ends in disaster, and I offer this 'ecosystem' as living evidence of that.

Money always requires someone to take it back as redemption for payment of debt.

Actually if you've ever been to a libertarian get together youll see the vast majority are poor as church mice. Why wouldn't they be? They give all their money to guys like in exchange for nothing(litecoin) or give all their money for gold mining stocks that always end up being pumps and dumps.
The only reason libertarianism is still around is because of its support from very rich people who like the idea of a 'hard' currency that protects their previously gotten gains. A libertarian monetary system ends with slavery for everyone but the top tier of the pyramid. We've had libertarian ideology dominate the west for the past 30 years and look what it produced.
Coincidentally both communism and libertarianism are flip sides of the same coin, promising utopia but delivering hell on earth.

Just because more dollars are circulating in the foreseeable future does NOT mean they will be worth less. Look there are more dollars today in 2016 than 10 years ago yet the price of nearly every commodity is lower.
What matters is if those dollars are prudently spent. If they are spent prudently then wealth in the real economy as measured by the goods and services we use everyday increases.
You have to understand that all spending carries with it an inflation risk, imagine if even a few bitcoin early adopters decided to go and spend their bitcoins on lets say US dollars. There is a risk of the exchange rate collapsing and triggering inflation in BTC terms!
So once again increasing the total units of dollars(which account for debt) does *not* necessarily mean there will be price increases!

Silver and gold are supply restricted goods. A commodity standard does *not* exist spontenously or organically. Look where the gold standard came from the state forced it on the economy. Before the gold standard, England used 'tally sticks' which was a method of keeping track of IOU's, it lasted 1000 years and formed the basis of the British Empire until the gold standard was forced onto everyone. The gold standard impoverished the absolute majority of people while ensuring the creditor class would keep a stranglehold on the society. It reduced the British Empire to what it is today, a lame island.
Credit based money is absolutely organic and has *always* appeared on its own in trade. Look at bills of exchange in middle ages! Credit money allows people to cooperate together, commodity based money rewards anti-social behavior(hoarding).
Yes you are correct, defacto anything can function as money but in a sophisticated economy goods that are supply restricted can never keep up with the productive power of humanity.
What we use as money is not a commodity but a unit of account! You reading too  much into primitive Murray Rothbards vision of money. He wanted his gold shekels to swell in value.
Second off, in tribal economics, pursueing individual wealth was highly frowned upon.  Can you imagine Roger Ver, Eric Voorhees and Ayn Rand all on an island together, bartering their way to mutual benefit? Hah!

Write down bad private sector debts while simultaneous providing a fiscal boost especially to households via suspension of payroll taxes.
This would have immediately ended the stagnation, there is also a political issue to solve and that is 'living wages'. Wages in Japan are too low, making it difficult to raise a family so the birth rate plummeted. Japan ran too large export surplus. Any country that runs an 'export' oriented economy has to keep domestic wages low to prevent people from affording stuff. 
What Japan was doing was sending millions of cars, appliances, electronics to the US in return for treasury bonds held at the Fed. This is essentially a huge form of foreign aid(from Japan to US). Japan became a manufacturing colony of the US after WW2 and this came with consequences they are experiencing over the past 30 years...

In a fiat monetary system rising interest rates are inflationary because you are increasing the price of money. The government is a net payer of interest. During the volker years something like 10-15% of the fed budget was going to interest payments. Those interest payments are someones income. At the same time high interest rates make it harder for productive business to refinance credit they need so many times there is less production in the economy. This means more money chasing fewer goods. High interest rates kill the real economy while subsidizing wealthy bondholders with what is essentially a form of welfare.
Volcker targeted M1 money supply which was an extremely primitive way of measuring how much money was in the economy. The Fed *cannot* control the supply of money in the economy. This was based on the failed theories of Milton Friedman. It ended up causing unemployment as the only way to kill inflation is to throw people out of work. This has consequences that the US never recovered from, including a near total loss of the manufacturing base. The only way to get rid of inflation is to throw people out of work! So you kill the entire economy in the process which is exactly what happened. Afterwards wages never recovered(to this day) to their pre Volcker inflation-adjusted level. What helped Americans maintain their living standard was credit for consumption which ended with the collapse of 2008.
The role of Volcker killing inflation is completely overstated by mainstream economics  because they justify his total annihilation of working people as good. 
Volcker famously said “Look, your constituents are unhappy, mine [banks and bond holders] aren't."
That should tell you exactly what special interest group the Fed represents.
Falling interest rates decrease net national income as the government pays out less in interest. Every country with low or zero interest rates tends to have a strong money(deflation). Look at Japan, Swiss and now the US. Every country with double digit interest rates has a high rate of inflation.

Nobody notices because only sociopaths worship technological achievement. Sure the airplane decreased travel but it also brought a host of negatives with it.

Volcker didn't just raise rates. He targeted the M1 money supply and forced the economy into a massive recession(from which it never recovered to this day). The only way to reduce inflation is to throw people out of work. You have to force the unemployment rate up so people have no money to spend in the process you kill the entire economy. The only way to solve an inflation problem is to increase production, not do the opposite which is what Volker did.
Bondholders at that time were getting desperate because they were watching their sterile wealth vanish before their eyes, however the high rates of inflation were helping wage earners pay off debts. Volker decided to kill labor at to save the USURY class.
Volcker raising interest rates sky high increased payments that bondholders were getting which absolutely increased inflation in the economy mainly for what rich people spend. Look what a rolex cost etc. Volker only deflated worker wages, he never actually eliminated inflation. The battle with inflation nearly killed the entire economy.
Volker decimated US manufacturing as it was impossible to refinance loans at double digit interest rates. Manufacturers were looted by Wallstreet(famous Jews like Carl Icahn 'corporate raiding') because they had no access to credit so their assets were trading for next to nothing. What remained simply moved overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor. 
Look interest rates are not an effective way of increasing inflation because they add income to only a tiny % of the economy. Essentially what Volker did was kill the economy to save the bondholding class from the inflation boogie man. Ever since Volker, interest rates have been kept artificially high well above both the inflation and real GDP growth, thereby transfering trillions of wealth to fewer and fewer hands.
Austrian economists operate under models that are obsolete today because we don't use gold as money. So they thought we would get hyperinflation if rates were zero. Well rates are zero today and oil is lower than in 2007 when rates were 5%. 
The problem in Japan was an excess of private sector debt, so the private sector began reducing spending and saving more while the government did not respond properly. Everytime the government attempted to increase its deficit by reducing taxes or increasing fiscal outflows all the hawks came in and attacked it. So Japan has been stuck in a deflation that is now coming to its end with a demographic collapse as nobody in Japan can afford to maintain a family. The same fate awaits the West which killed off a huge % of its population via birth control + abortion that only gave the illusion of a rising living standard. Now we have the side effects of immigration + debt deflation so you get political backlash occuring...

It rises because of arbitrage bots bidding across exchanges.
There is no such thing as equilibrium. 
Wether a price holds over a longer period can easily be predicted if there is enough demand to cover supply created by miners.
In late 2013, over 5million per day of BTC was being supplied to miners on daily exchange volumes of maybe 20 million so of course this wasn't sustainable.
Today thanks to cryptolocker and other ransomware we have 3million+ everyday at least of demand helping obsorb what miners create(1800btc). So yes the price can easily maintain these levels.
My own projection based on the exponential demand for bitcoin due to ransomware is the price reaching a target of $822 which implies miners being paid 1.5million a day in subsidy. I think this is easily sustainable.
Target $822 on this move. We can get more if ransomware really becomes adopted globally. So far in 1Q 2016 ransomware revenues are 10x what they were in all of 2015 and that is just what is reported. 3Q and 4Q were looking at min 500 million each quarter coming in! Spending = driving bitcoin.

Arabs buy US dollars when they sell their crude oil. Saudi Arabia would *not* exist as a state if it wasn't for US military protecting them. Saudi Arabia came into fruition as an British Empire project, the US as the 'successor' to the British Empire continues this relationship. 
Saudi's price their crude in US dollars requiring most of the world to get dollars in order to buy oil.
To get dollars you need to sell stuff to the US and the US *must* run trade deficits. This allows Americans to consume products without having to produce them. It is the single most important advantage American consumers have over the rest of the world. 
Arabs are forced to sell in dollars in order to benefit from US military protection. If this relationship didn't exist, Saudi Arabia would have collapsed ages ago because of the Shite powers in the region.

Here we go again with the same Zimbabwe debunked scenario. Dude, the government in zimbabwe stole farm land and gave it to soldiers as payment for the war effort. The problem was the soldiers had zero clue how to operate a farm so food production completely collapsed. Of course that is hyperinflationary. When you lose the majority of your production it automatically implies inflation. Are the other developed economies shutting off the vast majority of their productive capacity at once? NO.
A state creates debt when it transfers assets from the private sector to itself. Example when it hires soldiers for a war effort and pays them in its own currency. On the states balance sheet it has a liability while on the balance sheet of the soldiers it is an asset. As I previously said a fiat issueing state is *not* limited by finance, it is limited by its capability to efficiently organize resources. 
The total debt of the US government = private sector savings. It is double entry bookkeeping. That 18 trillion dollars represents the SUM of all previous deficits. What were those deficits spent on? Namely defending Israel + bailing out banks. That however is a different topic!

Your CC is linked to a bank which performs a forex transaction.
Read my post again. Economic agents offer goods and services denominated in state scrip. That is why you hold it. Why do they do so? Because of a public debt obligation(tax) and than private debts(bank credit).
Taxes create initial demand for otherwise worthless government scrip. It has ALWAYS been this way throughout history.

Just because land is frequently used for speculation does not mean it is a good thing. Land aswell as real estate speculation leads to large swaths of poverty. Why does everything amongst this crowd have to be turned into a speculative commodity with no end purpose?
You haven't been able to counter argue his points, merely bringing up other things that are gambled with as well is not an argument. 
Many things jstolfi pointed out are simply true. Bitcoin early adopters got 'rich' because other people came in the future with large sums of fiat money to give them because they were motivated by someone else coming along down the line as well. Bitcoins first customer Hal Finney *immediately* recognized the potential for vast riches. 
Bitcoins do *not* create wealth. They are sterile digits that do not produce income. There is no other way other than the greater fool coming along to take you out of your trade. If 10 guys have millions in capital gains from bitcoin that means thousands if not more have capital losses.

Totally wrong. A fiat issueing government *never* has to repay any debt it has on its balance sheet.
Government debt = private sector savings to the penny. 
Think about it. Can the US government run out of dollars? No because it creates them as it needs to draw resources from the private sector to the public. That is the entire point. Effective resource allocation is not limited by finance under a fiat money system.
A fiat monetary system only fails if the state itself fails.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:14:06
Treasuries are bought with US dollars that were created previously when the US ran deficits.
The US government does *not* need to borrow the money it creates but you need the government money to buy the bonds. So which operation came first?
Do you understand this mechanism?
Government bonds are like savings accounts. They represent perpetual annuities to rich people and pension funds. In a fiat monetary system the government does not need to issue bonds. This year they rolled over trillions in bonds and did anything happen? No.

Because of artificial scarcity, bitcoin acts as a barrier on transactions occuring. You need to obtain BtC before you can perform a transaction. If there aren't any BTC available you have to *bid* up the price essentially imposing a tax on yourself.
Finny is correct that digital banks can use bitcoin as a starting collateral to issue their own digital currencies. This would allow for widespread financing of larger scale projects something that is currently impossible with bitcoin(due to artificial scarcity). As it sits right now bitcoin acts as a primitive barter good and any investments financed by bitcoin spending are entirely dependent on the willingness of largehoarders to part with their btc. So if guys like Roger Ver decide they want casinos instead of value production, theres nothing nobody can do about it.
You can see why this is a huge problem.

The dow jones turnover simply indicates a complete failure of capitalism.
Corporations simply do not survive over the long run. If one had invested in the initial Dow index, they would be broke now. This is called survival-ship bias. Only survivors are touted by investment advisors while completely ignoring the staggering failure rate of business. 
It simply proves that so called 'freemarkets' are heavily constrained by private rent seeking behavior, and ownership of assets concentrates into fewer and fewer hands overtime through the power of compound interest. This actions are what devastate enterprises not the so called occultic invisible hand and fair competition. 
Bitcoin infrastructure follows the same pattern albeit at a more rapid rate. 99% of capital investment into bitcoin related firms ends in disaster.
Should we really be cheering this? The evolutionists will come out claiming only the strongest and best survived. However what we see instead is a huge centralization theme playing out, where instead of the best surviving we have cartel formation(resistance to change). 
Is it really a positive thing that so much capital and labor have been squandered in this space? What benefits do we have to show for it? As of 2016, not a single successful bitcoin venture exists that has achieved a wide audience without being plagued with a dubious track record. 
In 2016, can any individual actually be trusted with their word and action in bitcoin? The answer is a stunning no.
How does a ecosystem built on fear, distrust, paranoia move forward?
We are approaching 36 months since the all time high of $1100-1200. Promises were made and none of them fullfilled, the value of a single bitcoin remains 50% lower. If the market is the best judge as the libertarian crowd claims, than it has acutely given its verdict. Bitcoin has so far failed to live up to expectations outside of making a tiny few rich.
That brings up the elephant in the room. Whom does bitcoin serve?
So since 2009 we have a handful of shady characters becoming wealthy enough to live out their dreams while preying on a group of people completely enslaved to uncontrolled passions and emotions. 
So yes liberty was delivered, but for the Roger Vers and Eric Voorhees' of bitcoin, for everyone else time and money was wasted.

Yea it seems to be the norm in this space to screw people over with excessive fees or hidden premiums. Look what happened with bitcoin atms, the casinos, exchanges. What more incredible is you have a flock of apologists always ready to explain away 30-50% premiums, the latest one was that people 'saving' for retirement somehow want to overpay now because in the future it will be worth 1000% more. 
It's just accepted as normal here because of libertarian philosophy. If rents are extracted by 'private actors' its perfectly fine however if its the state doing it, theres somehow this invisible line that was just crossed and it now becomes morally unacceptable. Does that really make sense?

People are in bitcoin because they believe they can turn bitcoins into more fiat money just because of time.
I don't understand what you are having trouble with here? Bitcoin has been often compared to digital alchemy, transmuting X into Y because of *time*. Over time my bitcoins are expected to turn into more dollars which I than I can buy more goods with. Everything outside of this is just reasons.
The topic of getting rich fast, or price movements has become defacto taboo and has been papered over in this subreddit with all sorts of positive posts. But the intention has never changed. We are in here because we want to emulate those before us who already have become rich. Early adopters are seen as heroes and captains of industry even though many of their incomes have come from very very shady activity. That doesn't matter.
Dude you don't need to run a sales pitch on me. Telling me bitcoin 'offers something different' and has a 'unique value proposition'. Believe me I get it. Im here too waiting for $10k.
Look the first thing bitcoiners do when they wake up is check the *dollar* price of bitcoin. That number is all that *ever* mattered. Hal Finney as the first bitcoin user after Satoshi immediately highlighted this fact when he stated the potential value gain was massive.
Anyone who has bought bitcoin and claims the price is not important is either a simpleton(Andreas Antonopolous) or a liar.
