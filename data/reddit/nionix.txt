What happens when quantum computers crack the hash algorithms, destroying it's security? 
Bitcoin will have to evolve beyond its current state, so really none of its main features are future-proof right now. Will still need to curb some stuff from alts.

In the case of huge news about Tether causing mass evacuations of funds.. where do you think that money will go?
Into Bitcoin, causing huge price spikes. There will be profit in the chaos.

The value of the tether is inflating next to the dollar, so printing more tethers keeps the value more in line with the dollar. 
There is no guarantee that the tether is actually backed up in a 1:1 ratio. Only on the front of the website does it say this.. but not in the terms or white paper.

Wow, thank you for the only sensible answer in this thread. Had to scroll to the bottom for the actual reason instead of just doom and gloom.

Only on the front of the website does the Tether state it is backed up 1:1 but not in the white paper or in the terms of use:
However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency.
There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money.
The value of the tether has been rising ($1.03 last time I checked) because more people using the the same pool of cash causes value inflation. Printing money reduces the overall value of the pool - thereby lowering the value to be more in line with an actual dollar.
Dangerous because it is certainly NOT backed up 1:1 and could cause a crash, but at least now I understand why they're doing it.
