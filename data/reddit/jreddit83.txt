So this fork is different in that if you sell your coins from the forked chain they get taken out of the other chain too? If so why do people keep talking like they're gonna get free money like with the bcash fork?

The funny thing about bitcoin rallies is that maximalists begin to declare the world is starting to "get it" and so on, while in reality, the new money is keeping their coins on the exchange and they don't want to risk making a mistake with a wallet, address typo, or password loss. That means a bad actor could mt gox 2.0 an exchange and the whole movement gets a major pullback because people aren't getting it that decentralization means education and responsibility for care of your own money. That's why I think price rising faster than people are learning the ropes of decentralized money management is dangerous for the space.
