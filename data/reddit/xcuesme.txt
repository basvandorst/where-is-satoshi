This is fukn pathetic. Whatever happened to p2p cash and banking the unbanked. Pfft

Seems to me that they are both fukt. One has Axa/ Bildergerg involved at the top, the other has the Chinese Government. Either way you look, it seems to be hijacked and not what it is supposed to be.

How does that work for somebody with F all from the third world?

I wouldn't say I was being negative but really if it costs even $5 or $10 usd to open a channel then it still  excludes a lot of people from using it. Bitcoin should be for everyone banking the unbanked and all that.

I always saw bitcoin as a way to enrich the poor of the world. If they are excluded from this system as well then what is the point of any of it

You have to pay to open a channel?

What if you dont have 300k satoshi to start with? Cant use it?
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:43:16
This whole argument is so fukt. Satoshis vision was for p2p cash. May the best p2p coin win.

Bitcoin IS bitcoin. Bitcoin isnt segwit or lightning.

On the brink of major adoption the block size was kept small for no reason.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:58:45
So bitcoin should change its name to segwit coin? Lightning coin?
