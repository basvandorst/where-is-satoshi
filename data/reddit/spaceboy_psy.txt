Dude, have you still not read your Marx? He debunked Say's Law a century and a half ago ;)

aha yes, thanks, just found the CME page myself after posting.
So looks like CME is: Jan, Feb, March, June. And settlement dates are:
Jan last trade date 26th, settlement date 31st.
Feb last trade date 23rd, settlement date 28th.
March last trade date 29th, settlement date 5th April.
June last trade date 29th, settlement date 5th July.
And CBOE: 'The Final Settlement Date for "weekly" XBT futures is two business days prior to the Friday of the week denoted by the ticker symbol. The Final Settlement Date for "serial" and "quarterly" XBT futures is two business days prior to the third Friday of the month denoted by the ticker symbol.'
ok now to tidy up my original post to make it more helpful...

Hm just noticed GDAX actually charge 0.15EUR on bank deposits. So to do it for free you deposit from your bank to Coinbase and transfer from there to GDAX?

Also, weirdly, GDAX specifically says when I click deposit 'A 0.15 Euro fee is deducted from all incoming SEPA deposits'. While Coinbase FAQ follows what you say, 0.15 for withdrawals but not deposits. Weird.

Also good advice. But bank transfers take time, so I'm sure some people find themselves in the situation of wanting to buy crypto sooner than a bank transfer will arrive.

Fingers crossed brother :)

Looks like that's the way

Also might be worth adding that if you can wait for a bank transfer, but don't have bank funds and want to deposit from a card, it's much cheaper that going straight from card to Coinbase if you deposit from card to Revolut, paying a 1% fee, and transfer that to Coinbase (and then to GDAX).

I just noticed this too. Does anyone know if there are now mins for ETH and LTC? Doesn't seem to tell you unless you just try it.

Can I ask what country that bank account is in? I only made my first deposit this morning, and still waiting for it to show up (hence looking at card rates). Really hope they'll be as quick as yours in future. Though probably the first one will take longer than normal due to more authentication checks?
Need it to hurry up so I can buy some Ethereum before everyone buys the shit out of it with Bitcoin Gold! :'D
