The fact that they haven't been hacked doesn't necessarily prove they are well versed in protecting against attacks, just that nobody appears to have been successful in attacking them yet.  If anything, this minor incident just proves that everybody makes mistakes.  What's to stop them making a similar mistake which results in their database being wiped?
I'd expect they are more stringent in the code which is actually running the site, and have multiple encrypted backups, but you never know.

Discounts that will now be offered in phishing emails.

What's the difference between them being hacked and them stupidly leaking data?  Surely we only care about the end-result, not the vector?

And just so people know it's just the wallet.dat file which needs backing up (right?) Everything else can be automatically rebuilt from the network, though it may take some time.

You're missing an interesting point, that people could give their votes to other people and this would be logged.  I've nothing against votes being given to more politically-minded people than myself but I would take issue with large-scale vote buying, and that would become apparent by viewing the chain.

Well it's not all that drastic a fall, at least not long term.  If we believe the value of Bitcoin will continue to rise over time, a short-term drop like this is of no real concern.
We knew the people expecting a large rise in price due to the recent New York conference would be selling out soon after the rise failed to happen, and a few people selling out will bring the price down and scare others into selling out too.
If you look at the Williams %R and the Stochastic charts you can see they've been falling for around a week on Britcoin, and a little less than that for MtGox.  It was only a matter of time before we reached critical mass where it dropped substantially since the youth of the market means people get easily scared into cashing out.
I don't know what's going to happen over the next few days.  Traditionally it took three days for people to get money into MtGox to buy at these sorts of low prices, that's less true these days and so it may well correct itself fairly soon.  I don't think it's going to go back up to the old prices of $11 any time soon though, and we're definitely not going to see $20 without some external forces pushing prices up.

The stability will come with more usage, but that is impossible in bitcoin.  It simply isn't designed to scale to the size that would be required to bring a decent amount of stability.
One day any node connected to the bitcoin network will need to transfer gigabytes of data a second.  It will also need terrabytes of disk space.  This simply isn't achievable now, or in the near future.
So yes, bitcoin is technically working now, but it's not the end solution.  It's simply a step along the way to having a much better crypto currency, one which we need to be thinking about now.

I get the feeling that it would be a modified version of Bitcoin without the ability for just anybody to mine.  If you let people mine and then spend that on votes then it means votes are tied to processing power which is tied to money, and this would be bad.

Has nobody been following the market and watching the technical indicators?  I'm only surprised that this didn't happen after the weekend.  It'll stabilise again in a couple of days.

I've always wondered what would happen if the "bad guys" started using exchanges like this.  I'd imagine it will start making the exchanges more difficult to operate if it becomes widespread, which will make Bitcoin even harder to get hold of.
I can't see good ways of protecting against this either, they're unlikely to be stupid enough to use the same exchange account for everything.  Banning open proxies and tor exits seems like a smart move, but that's not good for paranoid but "good" users and it's unlikely to catch all the "bad" guys either.

You mean similar to Witcoin but with actual decent content?
