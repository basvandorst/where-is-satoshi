Coinbase Pro is one of the top exchanges.

Can you buy gas with BTC there?

I did. I only used the platform for one trade because of that issue. Also the fees to withdraw are somewhat outrageous for some assets.

You won’t find any without verification requirements due to AML (Anti Money Laundering), ATF (Anti Terrorism Funding), and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.

I once made a trade on Binance and only half of the filled order was in my account after. Luckily after withdrawing the assets the missing ones appeared, because customer support is a joke. If anything goes wrong customer support may be an issue for you as well. Also some of the fees for withdrawing assets are very expensive compared to other exchanges for some assets.

Saving so much heartache for the world the dev certainly deserves A LOT more!!

If someone wrote a technical document on how to purchase and send them bitcoin, they are sending it to more people than you most likely. Also the first page could easily be changed by using someone else’s name and town.

I don't trust the centralized exchanges with my crypto. I have had terrible luck with customer support for some exchanges in the past. Using a trusted wallet or a paper wallet is the best way. Plus it is very simple to import a paper wallet onto a blockchain interfacing wallet app.

Mining is just incentives to keep the network/blockchain growing. Without miners, the network would not be active.

These asic miners are so high risk. I’m skeptical what the ROI will be upon delivery and after the other miners flood the market. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:38:02
Main problem I have with them is when they go obsolete. My gpu mining rigs still have value as their components can be used for other applications after retirement. I understand that ASICS are the only way to mine at a profit, but I dislike them in therms of recyclability.

When trying to resolve the issue I submitted support tickets, but the only replies I ever got were automatic bot replies telling me to look over the articles in the FAQ section of their site. Luckily the issue resolved itself without customer support’s help.

Hopefully after some time, average people will adopt to use the technology because of its advantages. 
When the internet was first becoming adopted, people didn’t think the concept have validity.

Bittrex is reliable and reasonable.

Send .1 to the address to get rich! Lol twitter accounts are easy to hack I suppose. So many ghost accounts that have the same name and verification symbol are used to scam. I remember when the Ethereum founder said he was giving out double the amount anyone sent to an address.

Throw back to gdax and toshi lol. I like the projector setup!
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:19:12
How often are your trades?
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:22:18
Lol is gdax still around?
