If you trust yourself less (to backup the key) than potential hackers out there, then this would be a solution that makes sense.

Why not transform the idea into a phone app instead?
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:50:53
Well no, since it isn't exchange tradable but instead OTC it literally isn't like an ETF.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:28:29
For an exchange not dealing with fiat that is.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:38:26
Well yes and no. There are always ways to remain under the radar if that is your intention. However bitcoins foremost purpose and value does not lie in anonymity.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:23:26
With the cooperation of the exchange, yes. At least to the extent that the exchange has information about you.

Oh sorry I managed to completely miss your point in the previous comment.

You can't use something with zero value to transfer wealth, it simply does not work that way. Also bitcoin in itself isn't really anonymous.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:36:38
2% transaction fee? That does sound quite high. Kraken for example takes 0,2% at most and bitstamp 0,5%.

It is worth nowhere near $37,000 at current rates. Bitcoin has dropped down from the $1,000 mark quite while ago.

By no means always. Often, sure, but %pa is also usually appropriate to use for the investment period in those cases. For these liquidity swaps daily interest rate is imo a much better term as they seldom are held for years or even months.

In which world is it a better outcome that the funds have been stolen? On top of that this would be a terrible lie as if you re-gain control over the wallet and the funds how on earth would you explain your previous lie then? On top of that, when this case finally does come to a point where things need to be proven, it just takes some serious crawling through the blockchain in order to show that the coins in fact still are in the cold wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:12:35


This is not solid advice. For example an offline computer can have a tainted random number generator, modified to only feed you addresses that the attacker can sweep at a later point in time. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:43:02
Looking at the simulations (which btw don't load correctly for me) it seems that it makes buy/sells on very small swings and doesn't take fees into account. The results would likely be much less impressive with fees involved.
@_date: 2014-01-03 11:04:25
People keep saying this as if any problem with the protocol that arises can be easily fixed. Fact however is that the more popular BTC becomes the less trivial it will be to get enough people on board with a hard fork.
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:48:20
So is this open source, or why should we trust this piece of software?

@_date: 2014-05-16 14:46:56
There are, and have been for long now, plenty of exchanges that allow shorting of bitcoin. Bitfinex and btc-e to mention two popular ones.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:49:31


Exactly, if you think there is a chance to find the key, why try to cover up the mistake with a worse scenario where ther is utterly no way to re-gain control of the coins.
@_date: 2014-01-02 09:42:54
No, *danforster* got it correct. 
By selling a put you are agreeing to buy the underlying asset (BTC) from the person who buys the option from you on the contractual strike price on, or before (depending on the option) the agreed upon date regardless of the actual market price. Important to realize is that the person who buys the put option has the right **but not obligation** to sell at the strike price, while the issuer of the put does not have the same choice.
Essentially, by selling the put option at $800 you are assuming the market price will exceed $800 at the end of 2014, thereby making the option worthless for the buyer. However, the buyer of the put locks in a minimum sell price of $800 for the end of 2014.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:15:43
Not as long as you keep an eye on the trading volume as well.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:47:30
Yes it is, but nowhere in your post did you mention anything about talking about yearly rates. As all the rates on Bitfinex are listed as daily compounding interest rates, I incorrectly assumed you would adhere to the same format.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:45:37
Not to mention that a steady inflow of capital from fees does not prove solvency in any way. For all we know they could have been paying themselves huge salaries leaving the core company insolvent.

Yes, what thomas533 is essentially doing is placing his trust in the VPN provider instead of his own ISP. The ISP will only see the connection going to the VPN provider but the VPN provider knows everything that he is doing online instead.
Many ISP's throttle p2p traffice (among other things) and these restrictions can be bypassed by using a good VPN service.

Not sure about that, but it is indeed very much possible to arbitrage between the ETF and the price of the underlying asset that the ETF is tracking if the gap grows large enough.

I assume that this line caused quite a few of the people who signed up to assume that they would actually receive 0.0125 BTC for signing up. This is not the case, as spiffy_nuthook points out your account will be credited with 25 store credits which cannot be converted to bitcoin, withdrawn in any way or even used to purchase stuff on the site.
Free money is free money, but I agree that the advertising is somewhat misleading and don't think the post would have gathered so much attention had it not been so ambiguously worded.
@_date: 2014-02-13 12:17:47
Yeah that is a good point, if the volume is sufficient to actually benefit from it. It is however not arbitrage.
@_date: 2014-07-21 11:25:36
He really does have a point though.
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:49:26
Sure it is VAT exempt, but you still need to pay 30% capital gains tax on every BTC to FIAT conversion if the value has gone up and any realized losses when the value goes down aren't deductible. On top of that there is no clear guidlines on if transaction fees even can be deducted or not. 
This means that at least Finnish bitcoin traders are fucked.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:49:17
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:57:51


It is in fact not at all what arbitrage is. A large bid/ask spread indicates either that the market is lightly traded and/or uncertainty about the actual value of the asset. There is no way to benefit from this without carrying risk, which is a very important characteristic of arbitrage.
The large spread enables you to instantly buy at a high price and sell at a low price, which is naturally the opposite of what you want. You can also put in buy/sell limit orders, but then again you are at the mercy of the market as you need someone to buy/sell into your orders for you to profit (and you need to take the trading fees into consideration as well which means you require a rather large spread). Most importantly, even if you do manage to benefit from this in the listed way, it was still not through true arbitrage.

@_date: 2014-07-09 17:34:46
That is true, but although many firms do there is really no need to rely on a middleman with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:26:53
Now if only realized losses (selling bitcoin at a lower price than it was bought as) was tax deductible as well. Currently in Finland active trading of bitcoins is made more or less unfeasible as all capital gains on bitcoin are taxed at 30% while losses aren't deductibe. There is also no official ruling on whether transaction fees can be subtracted from the gains or not.

No idea what OP is on about. The rates seem completely normal and on top of that it doesn't usually hover around 2% daily interest, but 0.2%.

The password gives another layer of security, if someone finds the card they can't get to your bitcoin without knowing it. Without this level of protection anyone finding a paper wallet will be able to access the coines stored on it.

[**WHAT’S NEW?**](
Our team has been working day and night to rebuild and restore security to the Bitstamp site so customers can resume transacting with us quickly, safely, and confidently. Bitstamp is now fully operational with a number of key improvements:
With the integration of BitGo multi-sig technology, Bitstamp is now the first and only major bitcoin exchange to incorporate the industry's best security practices available today. 
**COMPLETELY NEW HARDWARE INFRASTRUCTURE**
The Bitstamp systems are running on 100% new hardware deployed from a completely secure backup of our code and data. 
**AMAZON WEB SERVICES**
Bitstamp is now running on Amazon’s world-class AWS cloud infrastructure, architected to be one of the most secure and reliable cloud computing environments available.
**COMMISSION-FREE TRADING**
As a note of thanks to our loyal customers, all transactions conducted on Bitstamp through the end of the North American Bitcoin Conference -- January 17th (at 11:59pm UTC) -- will be commission-free. 
We appreciate your patience and understanding during this disruption of services. Since 2011, we’ve worked hard to be one of the largest and most trusted bitcoin exchanges in the world. While this is a time of challenge for our company, we expect to emerge from this experience having set an even higher bar than before for trust and confidence in our services. 
On a personal note, I’d like to thank the incredible teams at Bitstamp and at our lead investor Pantera Capital who have worked around-the-clock from multiple time zones in the last few days. I’m incredibly proud of the herculean work of this extended team, and grateful to the phenomenal show of support from customers, friends, and partners in the bitcoin community. 
We look forward to serving you!
For additional information, please refer to our customer FAQ or contact our support team at support
Thank you,
Nejc Kodrič
CEO of Bitstamp

Positive. Stamp holds two keys (presumably one in cold storage) and bitgo one. 
Since two keys are required to move the coins, stamp will either have to dig out their second one from cold storage or bitgo will have to cosign the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:32:55
They are not solely under his control as he does not possess a single one the private keys. Multisig does not in this instance mean that the customer holds a key, simply that multiple ones are required to move the coins.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:07:45
The point is that by including bitgo no single entity holds all the keys, meaning that a hacker could not get to the funds in the hot wallet simply by hacking into bitstamp's systems. This is assuming that the third keypair is kept offline.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:12:29
Naah, it is because of the zero trading fees.
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:07:43
Well it's 35 not 30, but his point is that they cancelled his buy for this amount. Not what the fees were that actually would have gone into coinbase's pocket. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 06:22:11
I don't see how this has anything to do with the "be your own bank" aspect. Bitcoin exchanges are providing a financial service and it has been shown time and time again that people will not vote with their feet before it already is too late. Whatever you do with the coins after you have acquired them is up to you and there is no reason to hold them locked up on an exchange unless you yourself choose to.

I do not have a operator specific model as it is the international version. But I'm sure more info on this will come out as the beta progresses.
I'll keep an eye on and twitter, thanks! Best of luck with the beta, very exited about the potential of a (near)hardware wallet on my phone.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:34:17
I personally love the TEE integration, have been hoping for something like this for quite a while already. 
I am currently testing the beta on my GS6 and so far I'm loving it. Integration with Mycelium is already great in this first public beta and the added security layer it provides over other mobile standalone apps is awesome.
@_date: 2015-08-05 05:20:36
Well I'm not replying to OP, but pointing out something in addition to Jaysusmaximus. Plenty of good ELI5 answers on the main subject in the thread already. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:12:55


It is not a custom ROM, simply rooted stock one (using the pingpong method which even leaves the knox switch intact). I just checked with another app and the folder is definitely empty. It seems a bit puzzling to me as GS6 should be supported as far as I have understood (I have the 920F version). I'm still on 5.0.2, but don't think this should matter.


That is good to hear. 
Is there any place you suggest I keep an eye on in order to pick up on any discussion/feedback on this matter? There are a few very popular custom ROM's available for the GS6 so I think quite a few people could be interested in this topic.
 
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:28:30
Thanks for letting me know. 
FYI I just downloaded it and after updating my security policy (samsung thing I think) it seems to have initiated correctly. It is still sitting on pending license approval, but prior to the update it said that a connection to the TEE could not be established. The previously mentioned McRegistry folder still shows up as empty though.
@_date: 2015-08-25 06:49:29
Sorry to poke such an old comment. However, I noticed that although a /data/app/mcRegistry folder is present on my GS6, it is empty. So is this a fail or a pass? Both the other files listed in your comment are present.
Furthermore, have you received any information during the beta on whether the TEE will work or not with rooted phones with tripped knox switches and possibly custom ROMs? 
I have tried searching for a definitive answer to this without any luck. And I am very interested in this point, as it currently is the only thing holding me back from migrating from the lackluster stock GS6 ROM.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:37:39
Well no, especially not since industrial mining clearly will be more of a determining factor than home mining.
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:43:54
Ledger Wallet provisioned successfully, so it would seem that it doesn't matter if the McRegistry folder is empty. Three new files appeared after the installation. 
I'll try it out with Mycelium and post my findings in the dedicated thread.

Well, AFAIK the blockchain was never intended as an anti theft measure. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:20:16
That is good to know, however I guess it still leaves the question regarding tripping knox open since pingpong doesn't do that (and is currently the only method of rooting which doesn't). As the pingpong exploit however has been patched it is very likely that most people wanting root will be running a s6 with knox tripped (especially now that 5.1.1 is out for the s6), which is why it would be interesting to know whether that disables TEE forever. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:58:54
Do you have any clue whether tripping knox on the s6 affects this working on it?
