If something major happened to Bitcoin's mining network, such as all top miners switching over to a much more profitable (or perhaps legal) coin, abandoning Bitcoin, it could take many, many months for Bitcoin to recover.
Since Bitcoin only changes difficulty every 2,016 blocks, it could be necessary to slowly slog through thousands of high difficulty blocks at a low hash rate.  Bitcoin confirmations would slow dramatically until the difficulty could adjust downward. The mempool and fees would explode.   It really all depends on how much hash remained to mine Bitcoin, which itself is determined by the current and perceived future price of Bitcoin, and also how many of those 2,016 blocks remain to be mined when the hash flees.
This proved to be a problem for many early altcoins with volatile mining networks.  Sometimes miners would jump on a low hash altcoin and run the difficulty way up, only to abandon mining it when the profitability dropped.  There were a lot of small altcoins stranded at high difficulty that never recovered. To discourage this abuse, many sha256 altcoins forked in difficulty adjustment approaches like Kimono's Gravity Well - KGW-  that change difficulty with every block.

Got out of Cryptsy and into Unobtanium

I dug it up on the BCT thread.
Starts about line 62.  Again, take with a grain of salt. Probably pure FUD. 
This has been out there for months, and I mention it here just because it seems to map to this topic.
It's likely Wolong is long gone from Uno, but for those asking who Wolong is and his relationship to Uno, this all part of the myth.

So typical and expected, it's boring. zzz

Take a look at the "all time" chart for UNO at Cryptsy. See that huge rise in February?  That was Wolong's famous UNO pump.  He tweeted all the way through it so there is no question that it was him.
Here's an interesting coincidence  The same day Wolong breaks his silence last week, a HUGE Uno wallet appears in the  place on the rich list.  You can see it yourself at 
 
Is that Wolong's wallet? We don't know yet, of course. 
There was a Pastebin post a couple of months ago that was "leaked" from a chatroom saying that Wolong was stuck in UNO, and had not been able to exit his pump. Its it true? Who knows.
There is a lot of speculation by traders that he may be planning another UNO pump.  Another rumor is that he is setting up a ForEx scheme and plans to use UNO for arbitrage (from another chatroom leak on Pastebin).
Wolong is very upfront about what he calls his "Game of Deception."  Leaks are often fake, or they may be true; it is impossible to know. Wolong does whatever is best for Wolong. Don't be greedy around these guy or he'll take it all.
So in a nutshell, that's Wolong in relation to UNO.

Are your pools merge mining other sha256 coins to increase the profitability for miners?  Why or why not?

This is a great VPN. I use them myself.  They are tops.
But use fiat, not Bitcoin. Remember the pizza.
