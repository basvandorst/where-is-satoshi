I will for him, he's right but for the wrong reasons. Ill use Japan's debt as an example.
Japan's debt is currently 233% of their GDP (gross domestic product)  this means that foreign investment into japan is essentially non existent due to its  frail and debt-ridden economy. to understand why you have to understand how japan got that much debt in the first place and where the debt is.
Japan was pretty much setback massively after WW2 and didnt really recover until the early 1990s.  Their market collapsed 1989 after the increase of inter-bank lending rate from the Bank of Japan. This caused the stock market crashed and equity prices dropped, banks and insurance companies were left with lots of bad debt.
The Japanese government and central bank supported these organizations by bailing them out and providing low-interest credit. Thus, these firms have to rely on support. But this eventually became unsustainable, so banking institutions had to be consolidated and nationalized.
Throughout many years, there have been a bunch more stimulus initiatives that were also used to help reboot the stumbling economy. Because of these government-approved actions, Japan’s debt level skyrocketed to become the highest in the world.
What matters tho is who the debt is owed to/owned by,  in this case it is the japanese people. not some foreign investors.  this means the risk of defaulting is very low(because it is in everyone's own best interest to not default). This means Japan is still well-off because it can adjust interest rates at low levels so that repayment values stay low relative to the overall debt level.  This is why when discussing debt and different countries it has a different meaning. 
TLDR; japan highest Debt to GDP ratio but the debt is owned by the japanese people not foreign investors therefore default will never happen.  Information like this
is why when discussing debt from different countries it isnt really the same "debt" as it is everywhere else, there are many factors.

Crypto is where you put your profits as a drug dealer, not what you buy with. You keep your margins, set aside your profits and living money (gas, food, rent, phone bill etc) profits go into various crypto projects.  Id much rather have my money sitting in crypto than Fiat because
A: if I get raided and im smart about it, when I get out. my crypto will still be there.
B: I dont have to leave piles of cash at various locations to be potentially siezed.
C: My fiat instead of sitting around can actually turn me a nice profit if I leave it in crypto.

because it is correct


pretending that it isnt happening or claiming that even if it is happening doesnt matter is a worse rebuttal....


anecdotal about your own trading history as an attempt to support your false position....


would you prefer I give you the long 500 word response that you skim at best? everything is always over simplified.  


your point only proves you more incorrect, Larger supply means lower price per "share".... 


Rarity is not the strongest driver of value.  If I blow my nose into my only Handkerchief.  it is Ultra rare, does that make it valuable? no ofc course not.  The main driver of value boils down to Utility....


again, I will gladly post a 500 word response but you wont read it, you play to the medium. this is reddit, simple is better. if you want to discuss the fine details and nuances go ahead, it only helps my position.


so you agree with me and are arguing against yourself then?


Ripple is a company, XRP is the asset. 


again, Ripple is a company, XRP is the asset. 


 First mover advantage has created brand name recognition, i mean it essentially started an entire new industry...

There are many benefits to this consensus protocol, such as; Immunity to 51% attacks, Immunity to forking, No direct financial compensation to encourage cheating, Deflationary now not in the future(fees are burned and supply is hard capped so every day there are less and less XRP in the world), Atomic swaps on chain, built in DEX, IOU/trustlines, smart contracts and green eco friendly requiring almost no energy costs to keep the chain secure or process transactions.

I would say its ability of Fungibility is on par with gold.  Fungibility is the 1$ in my pocket is the same as 1$ in ur pocket. the same is true for 1 troy oz of gold in my pocket vs your pocket and the same is true 1000 satoshis in my pocket vs 1000 satoshis in your pocket.
in order to be "sound money" BTC needs to be A medium of exchange, a unit of account, portable, durable, divisible and a store of value over time.  So far for the past 5000 years, only gold and silver have met those qualifications, every single fiat currency has eventually gone to a value of zero.  The number of currencies that have gone to zero is so abolute that it is a mathematical certainty that the USD will eventually be worth zero. (maybe not in my lifetime maybe in the next decade) only time will tell.
Bitcoins true challenge will be over time. I don't think enough time has passed enough yet in order to properly evaluate these qualifications.  It certainly is portable, divisible, fungible, a unit of account, and durable.  The issue is if it will be a strong medium of exchange (accepted everywhere) and a store of value over time (something currencies are not required to do / able to do.)
BTC will have to deal with Increasing hashrate/power consumption, The growing centralization of said hardware/hash rate over time, and The threat of quantum computing simply rewriting the blockchain plus many more threats/challenges.  Only time will tell tho.
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:21:51
yes, "money clipping" is one of the main reasons why the romans went down, that was one of the reasons that the western roman empire fell but the eastern roman empire didnt (constantinople) because the people of constantinople used a Pure gold coin for their currency. they survived and became their own empire for a few hundred years afterwards (until they started to dilute their own gold coin with copper)  They also invented anti counterfeiting measures (like the ridges on the edge of today's quarters) those are there to prevent clipping/shaving of the currency :)


yea that is always the issue, the more they try and fiddle with the currency (fixed interest rates, and other things) the more it will affect the dynamic yield curve of the currency.  This will eventually cause 3 month bonds to pay out more than 20 year bonds which causes an economic collapse.


yes this is one of its great features, in that it is highly divisible, and no more than the set amount can be created.  those are two of the most beautiful features of the BTC concept as a whole :)
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:47:15
I would love a gold backed paper currency to take over, the reference to using gold flakes is 2 reasons.
A. he asked me how big a 1$ gold coin was (and I have a lot of gold coins, some pure .999 Gold) others worth around 5-10$ each of gold in them. so it's not unreasonable to make a 1$ gold coin that is easy to do commerce with, the issue it will have is how pure it is.  The reason you want pure Gold in ur coins is because, Gold will never rust, and Gold will hold its value longer and be a fair medium of exchange because gold is "sound money" as i explained above :)
B. to go into another mini history lesson, using just Gold and silver is one of the oldest monetary systems and it has always worked until governments have gotten their hands on it and started to "tweak" it because they want to spend a deficit to fund their wars,programs, promises. for example (I found a video that explains it quite well)   the important part is from 4:50 till 7:44. :)

80% of all physical hardware is geographically located in 1 location
their hashrate is spread out across 6 pools all of which have a distinct advantage over every other geographical location due to the nations firewall, those pools on average mine 5% Extra empty blocks than everywhere else in the world.  This slows down the network as empty blocks dont process any transactions.  this along side the chinese governments disdain for BTC and the large financial incentive it would have to simply take the hardware and use it themselves is an actual threat nobody wants to admit is possible/talk about how to solve. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:25:20
I can but it requires a history lesson to show you the old monetary systems we used to use
1st system: (foundation of country until 1913) the gold standard
Since the creation of the country until 1913 the USA was on the gold standard, this meaning that every 20$ bill had a 100% reserve ratio of 20$ worth of gold held in reserve. you could go into a bank and exchange your bill for that gold at any time. most of the bills said "in gold coin payable to the bearer on demand" on each bill near the bottom to show they held the value of the bill in reserve at the treasury. each piece of paper money had value because it was backed by a physical asset.  in the actual constitution it says "lawful money shall only be gold or silver" it's a very simple system that is less than a dozen words and works.  That is the main difference between currency, and money. the gold is money, the paper is currency.
2nd System:(1913 until 1944) the gold exchange standard
in 1913 the central bank moved in and passed the federal reserve act of 1913. during WW1 the bank made it so you could no longer exchange ur bills for gold (during the war). they they printed a ton of currency (to fund the war) and we swapped from the gold standard to the gold exchange standard, this is where currency would be partially backed by gold. so you could have a 50$ bill but it would be backed up only by 20$ worth of gold, it was roughly a 40% reserve ratio.
during both world wars wars europe paid the US with gold for their consumer goods. for ww1 the US didnt really get onto the ground until the last 6ish months of the war. so for 4 years europe is sending all its youth and workers to war, all its factories are not making cars but tanks/bombs etc. so all its consumer goods came from the US since they were busy making bullets and tanks not tractors and cars/growing grain/food or whatever. the same thing happened in WW2 where for like 6 years the US sent all the grain / consumer goods and got paid with europe's gold.  This is where the myth of "war is good for the economy" comes from, war is only good for the economy if you're not in it but are selling the tools of the trade. 
near the end of WW2 the US had 2/3rds of ALL the world's gold. this is a problem because the rest of the world needed gold to back their currencies with plus all these loans of USD had been made to europe so lots of people had tons of USD and no Gold
3rd system: (1944 until 1973) the bretton woods monetary system
this is where we move onto the 3rd monetary system the bretton woods system.  This is where every currency in the world (except for like.. 4 small ones) would be backed by the US dollar, Then the US dollar would be backed by gold.  this gives the world stability and gives every currency the same medium of exchange, so for example there was no such thing as the forex. currencies exchange rates were fixed year after year, this allowed the trade system to boom. But there was a problem.  
under the bretton woods system there was no reserve ratio established, meaning the US could just print as much money as it wanted and it was not required to keep any gold in reserve. or it could be a 0% reserve ratio.  So all during the korean war, vietnam as well as president johnson's "great society" which was a set of social programs started in the 60's the US had been printing Tons and Tons of money to fund all these things, and we had exported them all over the world. in the 60's charles de gaulle (french president) actually called the US out for not keeping a gold reserve. (  the TLDW of his speech is, everyone has USD and only the US has gold. what happens if we all ask to cash in our USD in the US for our gold back? so he started sending USD from france to the US to get the gold back and from 1959 to 1971 the US lost 50% of all its gold (other countries joined in to get their gold back) in 1971 there was roughly 12 times more Dollars created than there was in gold (this is a massive problem) this was essentially a run on the bank except the bank was the US.  The US had committed a fraud (by printing more than they had) so Nixon was forced to take us off the gold standard. if he had paid out all the way until there was 0 gold left the entire world's monetary system would of collapsed (because everything is backed by USD atm)
4th system:  (1971 till now) The dollar standard
so in august of 1971 all the world's currencies became Fiat currencies, I dont know why the world went along with this but for some reason everyone went with it.
to give you a mini history lesson inside this one.  every single fiat currency that has ever existed in the world for the past 5000+ years, has gone to zero eventually. not a single one has survived over time.  The reason for this is because they aren't backed by anything.  They are all "floating" currencies and they bob up and down in relation to each other but over time, they all sink when compared to gold. They will always lose value, and purchasing power over time.  This is because more and more is printed but it isnt backed by anything of value, since 1913 the US dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
if your looking at the timeline roughly every 35-45 years we have a new monetary system. I think we are overdue for a massive collapse of our current system as it is backed by nothing but faith and bad deals.  The US currently Still "exports their inflation" by sending USD everywhere all over the world in exchange for goods and services.  But times are changing and we have China, India and Russia moving ahead to become new super powers, taking manufacturing/other things away from the US. the amount of USD in the world is staggering, if the rest of the world went to "cache" them in like the french/others in the 1960s, the US would go into hyper inflation (like venezuela/turkey) 
the example of this is essentially ur purchasing power would fall by roughly 50% every single day. so that 1$ apple is now 2$, then it becomes 4$, then it becomes 8$. this creates a scenario where nobody is saving their money because its only worth half as much the next day. this problem means the gov has to print more money to pay for the things it wants to buy/needs to function, this makes the money even more worthless and speeds up the velocity until 1 of 2 things happen, The currency collapses to zero, or the government turns off all its services for a long time (like at least 2-5 years) and lets the free market decide.  no government has ever chosen to not print the currency into oblivion ever in the history of the world because they always think they can get themselves out of the problem by just printing more.
TLDR; We dont use gold anymore because it doesnt allow the government to commit Fraud and spend into a deficit.  it keeps them honest and they dont like that.

gold/silver are/is the ONLY "sound money" that has survived the test of time.  Look back at all other fiat currencies throughout time, start alphabetically and ask what their value is today? I'll give you a hint, when ur halfway through the letter B, you will of looked at over 600 Different currencies, all of which are currently valued at 0.00$ the Only thing that has survived well over 5000 years is gold/silver.  Gold/silver so far is THE  only type of money that checks off all the box's to be "sound money"  a medium of exchange, a unit of account, portable, durable, divisible, fungible and a store of value over time.  
I would say BTC is an interesting experiment to attempt to re-create those classifications of "gold" in a digital form, the two issue's at the moment are medium of exchange and store of value over time. simply put, not enough time has passed, and not enough people accept it as payment so we don't know how true/false it is.  Yes the value has gone up A lot over time (depending when you bought of course) but on golds timescale it isnt even a blip on the chart. 
The other issue BTC has to overcome is while it currently solves the double spend problem through PoW, it will have to stand up to quantum computers which threaten to simply rewrite the entire blockchain in a short moment.  Moores law and Time are not on Bitcoins side, massive developments and improvements will be needed (and no im not talking about lightning network)
TLDR; Gold &gt; every currency in existence ever, BTC will have to fight Time and Moore's law to survive/prove it is "sound money"

you do know they make gold coins in different denominations right? thats kinda the whole point of coins... its not like back in egypt where people will need to put chucks of gold on the table and people will bust out their scales and shave off bits until the weight is even on the scale.... a current troy oz gold coin is like what 1300 ish USD. they make 1/2 oz, 1/4, 1/10 oz coins along side 10g, 5g, 1g 1/2g coins/bars
im not saying its "easy" to buy a loaf of bread in todays world im just saying, gold coins used to actually be the main medium of exchange... that was until the gov decided they needed to melt them down and dilute them with cheaper metals to pay for their wars.

my point is that when you say its hard to buy bread with a single gold coin, im saying people did do that for like 4700 years...like, every single day. 
im aware they used feathers, stones and other things for awhile but in the end gold/silver were always the best because of the properties that they posses over other things

I dont think you understand the difference between currency and money.  
You can currently lend and take loans backed or against gold.  The amount of loan depends upon the kind of security that is deposited in the form of gold and the applicant's repayment capacity. Coins and bars offer higher value than jewellery. Typically up to 60% of the value of gold is offered after valuation. 


its already happening so??? not sure what ur on about.


coming from the guy whos never heard of a gold backed loan is rather rich...

i mean, its a coin that is designed to solve a real world problem, its also  in market cap (and climbing to  possible this week with Swell..) shouldnt be so negative towards a coin that can make you money.

none of which was he tried nor convicted for.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:47:05
did you read what he wrote down in "said" journal? he had shit like "today I Ross Ulbricht have built a drug empire online" and other clearly fabricated bullshit, theres a reason the crown didnt pursue these charges.  hell the agents who were the leads for his case are now rotting in jail for theft from said case, clearly fabricated evidence.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:48:01
They did not offer murder contracts so yes, yes i do disagree.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:05:33


he was never tried nor convicted of this charge as the crown didnt have ample evidence that was credible to pursue it. this is what the media blasted becasue they wanted to put him away forever.
