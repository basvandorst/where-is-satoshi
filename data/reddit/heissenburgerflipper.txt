It seems a bitcoiner had $60mil stolen from his wallet
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:39:20
Cool.  I'll be sure to take your advice /s
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:26:36
Redditor for 6 days... that explains a lot
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:34
I heard the same thing at my workplace today.  I told him Bitcoin can't be hacked and more than likely an exchange got hacked.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:42:09
I'd buy coins, price would drop.  I had to buy less drugs.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:52:31
He didn't keep his private keys private 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:08:17
Agreed.  All I ever hear from people is that Bitcoin dropped.  Bitcoin has been skyrocketing  for months.    Those little drops are insignificant in comparison.  People just don't wanna believe.

Look up Canadian hospital wait times.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:47:41
Nobody knows.  It's all speculation.  
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:18:14
Another fun fact, there are more cannabis dispensaries than Starbucks in Denver.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:50:02
Fact:  those people will regret not buying
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:45:24
And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:19:13
Who cares about wait times?  People that are dying?
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:47:24
For some reason when I update, my old wallets are not showing up...  
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:11:50
Never forget
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:21:25
Why not?  I think the one of the best steps to understanding Bitcoin is understanding money isn't a real thing.  It's just a made up way to exchange goods and services.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:54
Probably overstock
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:32:46
Same here.  Bitcoin is cool.  Don't think what could've been, think what could be.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:40:05
Exactly.  Even if they had that 10,000 BTC, they would've sold as soon as it hit $1.  I'm done with USD myself as far as savings goes.  BTC has treated me well and my savings looks way better than if I had kept it as USD.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:19:08
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:30:19
I was talking about the people that make fun of the guy.  Not you.  You get my point
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:54
Leave the pizza guy alone.  Someone had to make the first transaction to demonstrate it was a real currency.  If it hadn't been him, it would've been "the sneaker guy", who traded 10,000 coins for a pair of sneakers.  Then people would be all over his ass.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:29:04
Those were the days.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 03:50:51
Still in the green.  Been using bitcoin since ~2013.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:47:15
Then you'll probably never get rich off bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:16:23
He definitely started it.  I believe Ross got too deep and his ego reached God-like proportions.  I believe he did order those hits.  Just my two Satoshis.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:20:07
The addresses,there are thousands btw, can be found by analyzing the first blocks ever mined and later by assuming Satoshi mined 50%,40%,30% etc of them as bitcoin gained adoption and other miners came into player.
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:28:29
We know the addresses Satoshi has his coin stored on.  Believe me, thousands of eyes are watching, just waiting for one of those coins to move.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:11:43
Like a pizza?
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:44:44
We would know if they were Satoshi's. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:24:18
Thanks stranger!  Everything seems to be working just fine.  I'll keep this post updated in case anything else happens.  Again, I am very appreciative.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:02:47
Jesus, are we still going on about that damn pizza?  You realize a transaction like this HAD to happen, right?  If everyone HODL'd back then and no transaction ever occurred, bitcoin would be worthless.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:15:36
Hahaha Trump pardon Ulbricht?  That's a good one.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:10:19
According to speculation they'll be worth less.  Crazy things happen.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:04:11
Why do people spend US dollars when, in a few years, they'll be worth more/less?
