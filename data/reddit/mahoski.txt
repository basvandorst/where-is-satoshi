Добро е што барем кај вас немало последици...
Еве ја Ружа, хахах...
Това е брат, за крипто испаднавме црна овца во Европа. Треба да се собереме повеќе луѓе од crypto community од Македонија и да пратиме писмо во министерството за финансии, да пробаме да ги вразумиме.
Поздрав, сѐ најдобро :)

As a Macedonian, can confirm. I was deeply disappointed by my country when I saw the map.

In these stagnant times in crypto, this brightened my day and took me back to about a year ago when we were all so euphoric about the future.

Well, for one, my government is pretty retarded.
Another thing that might have influenced this decision is that they confuse legit cryptocurrencies with a scam called OneCoin that was run by the Bulgarian mafia (they had a thot as the face of the "cryptocurrency")...
The OneCoin shills scammed a lot of people in my country who were ignorant about cryptocurrencies in general and were easy prey last year during the huge bull run.
OneCoin was a pyramid sceme, people bought in, they were told they're getting a certain amount of coins, but they weren't tradeable anywhere, they weren't listed. The people were buying some worthless pieces of paper and numbers on their screens.
Rumor has it, this was enabled by the corrupt prime ministers of both Bulgaria and Macedonia, they were getting a cut for allowing this scam to be run for almost two years.

That's not how it works. Newbies will think of all of those people who got burned. The older investors who bought high will hate BTC because of their loss. Very few people would get into it if it falls below 2.5K$. I think if it falls below 5K it will be over.

I have lost about 30K$ in unrealized money (lost profits) and it hurts, too... I can only imagine. 30K$ is a lot of money in my country, though. You can buy a small apartment with that money.

Actually, I was a freshman in college then and I had a brand new laptop on which I was considering mining, but I decided that it wasn't worth it because it would wear out my laptop parts too much. It's so painful when I remember it...
