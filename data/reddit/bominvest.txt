To answer your totally non-sacracstic questions.
By they, I meant that there is testing of the code being done by some volenteers.
Why are you nervous about meeting me? Or wish that you don't? I'm a pretty nice person. I have a feeling we will never meet though, thankfully!
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:07:25
Would like to tip you in something other than bch. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:54:02
I was wondering what we could do to help inspire coinbase to get segwit implemented on the btc wallets. Is it currently set up for LTC? I would assume so but I don't have a clue!
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:00:22
Crypto is a way of life. Will you get rich quick? I wouldn't count on crypto to do that for you any time soon. I buy things I need with litecoin and bitcoin as much as I can. If it becomes useful, it will become wanted.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:11:10
Neat! Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:25:45
I accept btc, eth, ltc, and bch!
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:24:27
Replace what you use to buy!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:15:41
Congrats to your success and good timing! You would be very popular in the forums here if your used your BCH as tip money to help encourage good, thoughtful discussion about the future of the bitcoin brothers. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:29:02
The response fits the charge
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:15:39
But they don't even send out free coasters, er, cds, with their software!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:38:19
I appreciate your response. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:53:49
I like this way more than I should
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:23:44
I mean that a healthy currency should be bought and used to buy things you might need. Going to buy a couch? Buy it on overstock with crypto. That's the type of use I mean. Use it like a checking account , not a savings account.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:30:28
What this gentleman of lady said. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:01:40
I love this way more than I should
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:16:46
Because they aren't used as currency. They are used as stores of value. The whole point of the world getting off of the gold standard was it's deflationary problem.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:14:51
That would be pretty awesome
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:54:32
It's not a matter of buying an old wallet, but using a wallet that uses the legacy wallet address (whose address will start with a 1). Most wallets are not segwit enabled. The bitcoin.com one comes to mind.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:19:32
I believe it is a legitimate concern to generally introduce new code onto a system that is celebrated for its general ruggedness. I do applaud the willingness of members of the community to test new features, but I was trying to reach out to the community to gauge what others thought too. Given your generally dismissive nature, I am guessing that you saw me as a target rather than someone wanting to start a conversation. God speed in your future endeavors and to your loved ones who put up with you.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:24:30

I am not an economist, but that is my best guess. That and productivity increases/being able to buy more stuff. If the population was constant and the productivity was stagnant, a constant supply of money would work fine I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:07:12
I disagree. Bitcoin needs to find its price after the speculators file out after they don't strike it rich. Don't buy and hold. Buy, use, and replace.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:16:03
Yes, it can be. If people are not encouraged to use the currency to buy or invest, then the currency becomes deflationary, therefore locking up the system. It has happened before and may be an issue going forward. BUT, this is assuming that Bitcoin would have widespread adoption and no other alternatives exist for currency as well. A lot of unknown factors to really say the effect.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:09:14
I would argue that maybe a different term should be used instead of centralized, which is defined as one of of the centralize-decentralized spectrum. Perhaps centralistic? More centralized? I don't think people are worries that the lightening network will cause bitcoin to be centralized, but it will make it more centralized, or centralistic. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:51:56
I don't think oligoply is quite right either, because it suggests collusion between the main players, which is not what the original point was. I think that the main distinction is the difference between the spectrum of centralized/decentralized vs. centralized and decentralized extremes. The only real centralized part of bitcoin is the blockchain because lightening can't function without that connection. Just thoughts in the wind though.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:03:24
Yes, that is true! I only speak for myself here and I make no specific recommendations for anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:21:39
This is news to me too.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:55:53
Oh, I thought that the person meant a way to tip in any currency. Like an in-house tip bot you can load up with the top 10 coins, say.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:10:31
Why wouldn't I? I also use litecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:45:53
1700 here. I was quick haha
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:13:19
I recommend using the cash app instead. Bitcoin buying is near instant. It's the fastest way I know to buy litecoin too. Just transfer Bitcoin to coinbase pro and transfer to litecoin for free. Whole process takes a half hour, mostly on Bitcoin conf
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:03:38
It didn't come out with copy-pasta functionality either. Still waiting on that!
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:34:36
Computers are hard guys, come one give him a break. It's not like he is satoshi.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:57:24
It didn't even ship with copy/paste functionality...

Don't forget the use of QNX on blackberry 10 phones!
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:59:56
I would argue that allowing community moderating is still much different than open source. The podcast was the first time I ever heard him mention that they even want to be more clear about their shadow banning. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:58:33
Love the reasoning. Now if only anything he has ever produced was open source. Fat chance. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:01:44
True. There is no such thing as a company that produces open source software at all.
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:58:53
Like what? Legitimately OK being wrong if there is data to support it
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:03:34
Lol how cute. He doesn't understand!
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:51:47
That is fair enough. I appreciate you taking the time to allow me to understand some of the details of what happened. It seems like there is less community support for such an idea than even last year, so it's probably best not to rock the boat just as lightning is coming on line. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:53:16
Apologies, I meant to say block weight. Thank you for your kind correction and contribution to the discussion.
@_date: 2019-03-09 10:57:36
Well then, I am wrong! Thanks or schooling me.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:14:06
I was under the impression that the segwit2x proposal had passed consensus, but the bch proponents broke off into their side project to bitcoin. Because they left the community, the proponents for the 2x upgrade also left, so the change was never made. Is this incorrect? I am trying to learn as much as I can, but it's hard to get the right answer after these things go down.

The issue for Facebook was that people didn't agree to the data being sold in the way it was. At least Google is honest about using your data.
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:52:27
Any chance for a litecoin port as well?
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:15:41
We should probably ban the universe for good measure. I read in a book that it was widely considered a bad move anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:05:39
Can litecoin come too?
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:27:07
This is correct. Thank you for saying this.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:26:39
Yea, I am a bit coin guy but no need to bring roger into this. Discuss the base tech. I personally think that a blocksize increase was needed last year to 2 or 4 mb blocks to handle the transactions until lightning is finalized. Even with this release it is early days. Looking forward to opening my own lightning node but I need to see how this test goes first.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:16:16
The creation of the universe did make a lot of people angry and is widely considered to have been a bad move anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:20:48

Maybe never. Maybe tomorrow. Hope this helps.

You can buy lots of things with money, including a website url. Roger Ver is a scam artist.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:38:57
Yea he is more the business guy/investor. BCH does have a roadmap though and it mirrors BTC, just with more emphasis on larger blocksize. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:55:46
I agree with this. Buying crypto should not be an impulse. That is like someone complaining that they bought AMC stock (theater company) instead of AMD stock (chip maker). Now bitcoin.com wallet suggesting BCH and coinmarketcap listing bitcoin.com as a bitcoin website...those are separate issues.

@_date: 2018-02-08 05:19:27
I do think a blocksize change can be done without I'll effect. Even increasing the size to 4 would be a huge relief on the network. And if there is a spike in transactions, you don't have to wait two days for the transaction to go through. Segwit and lightning will be a big help, but I don't think we are going to be able to stay at a 1mb block forever.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:40:43
It's bitcoin cash. Saying bcash is inaccurate. We can call it bitcash maybe.

If you have over 10k in btc, you also don't have a right to tell someone to HODL or anything else. Unless you are a financial advisor and are then legally liable. Do your own thing
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:54:15
I strongly disagree. Do you think most people know every component from the base code implementation to the regulation implementation to every possible use case AND be a part of that thing from day 2? He comes into this with a very strong business/cyber background and can understand how this might be useful. I bet he knows more about bitcoin that most of the shills on CNBC. God I hate what CNBC is doing to crypto...

I also enjoy using CoolWallet. It's a nice hybrid approach that keeps your funds safe until you pair the credit card-sized device with your phone. Only then is are funds accessible. The benefit is that your funds are as safe as they are in a cold wallet but as accessible as a mobile wallet. My 2 cents.
