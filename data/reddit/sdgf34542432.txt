Yes it works using a credit/debit card as long as you have verified by visa (where it redirects to your bank while making a purchase - most UK cards have it by now). uphold.com has a UK bank account for faster payments (I think they're the only service that does) and also takes cards. 
Other useful services are  - cheap SEPA transfers to  and other EUR exchanges.
Two other non-banks that essentially give out bank accounts are;
 - a lithuania based payment company that gives out IBAN accounts (useful for SEPA to reach exchanges).
 - a similar service based out of bulgaria?, but using Maltese IBAN codes.
these are also useful for reaching kraken and other EUR accepting exchanges without spending much on transfer fees.

perhaps after asking your bank to lock your account they're unable to send the money back? 
 
 edit: also It could be the extra transacitons you were seeing are fx currency conversion charges applied by your bank.

They oppose it simply by running classic.. You think they'll stop running classic to allow segwit to pass? or that Classic will adopt segwit? or that core will just push it through and hope for variance/good luck for it to activate? (I doubt they will do that). Infact all three scenarios aren't likely IMO.. which leaves the other option that it just never gets put into the code.. what will happen instead is anyone's guess but probably a massive freakout in a couple of months when everyone slowly comes to this realization.

I kindof wonder if MMM is a stealth helecopter money operation disguised as a ponzi scheme.. probably not.. who knows though.

They could adopt it as I said.. perhaps if they made it optional with a runtime flag it would be politically possible for them.. we shall see.. but since noone's even talking about it, I doubt it will happen anytime soon.

Perhaps they would benefit in some edge cases, but double-spending is more or less impossible already.. that's the point.

Unless Classic adopts it, or loses significant hashpower by then; it won't be implemented. IMO segwit may never go live.

It would not be necessary for a centralized payment channel system based on bitgo's existing [instant]( (but currently all on chain) network.
