If they aren't purchasing the BTC, isn't that literally just betting on the price? I get that futures contracts are essentially that, but it seems legally sketchy to openly place bets on the price like that. I'd assume they'd fall under some sort of gambling laws.

Wait, but you didn't say candlejack. Is that meme even still arou

It's definitely not expected. Remember that you're paying in BTC and not USD, and you paid what they requested in BTC. 
Would you expect the seller to refund your BTC if it suddenly shot up in price after making a purchase?

As somebody who is only starting to understand how these types of companies work. What exactly does that mean?
From what I've read, I think physically backed futures would mean that anybody placing a futures contract would need to own the btc they're willing to lose, but with paper-backed futures, no BTC is transferred at all, I think? Is that sort of close? Sorry if it's a dumb question, I've been seeing this a lot and having a hard time wrapping my head around it.

The case looks dope! It looks like your bed is slightly unlevel (er, just not low enough), though. Printing that design on glass would look killer. Any chance you'd share the STL? i'd like to give this print a shot.

I’ve been apprehensive about day trading like that, but have been giving it more consideration lately. I’m assuming you trade outside of coinbase for that type of transaction?
Every time I think I’d like to sell and rebuy at the dip, I see how much I’m losing in taxes and transaction fees. I can’t help but think that a proper trading platform has ways around that?

Sure. People see a post and upvote it, then move on. Other people see a post and click the comments.
More people upvoted and moved on than those who downvoted, and also clicked the comments and upvoted the logical posts.

I'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to this sort of thing, but if it were illegal, wouldn't it be something other than a free market?

I don't really follow these bitcoin-&gt; cash cards, so I might be missing something crucial, but they seem to me like they're permanent solutions to a temporary problem. If people continue to spend cash at stores with these types of cards rather than spending bitcoin, the stores don't see to have any incentive to accept bitcoin. Seems like a middle-finger to the stores who do accept bitcoin.  
I'm really a very light follower (read: long-time newbie), though, so I wouldn't put too much stock in my opinion. Just a layperson's perspective.
