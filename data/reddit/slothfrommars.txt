@_date: 2017-07-17 12:16:57
That sounds more complicated than rocket science... 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:33:08

Rpietita (main monero asshole) should be in jail long time ago
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:45:38
IMHO people got enough stress checking crypto prices already but imagine what would happen if they see them constantly - they go bananas :) Better buy it and forget it... Unless one is a daytrader

Problem is that Amazon Ledger dontt send products to place i live or maybe even whole Europe (tried to different countries with 2 different addresses)
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:54:22
Oh, sorry my mistake! I mixed up something, you're right, that's a fair deal then! Thanks! 
P.S. same Ledger Nano S on amazon.com 289$, amazon.co.uk - £199.00 and  - 69.60 EUR? 3x price difference? Thats weird ;/

I'm Polo customer for a few years and never had a single delay. WD at least once a week - withdrawals works like a charm for me. Sorry for your troubles :/
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:11:12
hahaha, trolbox = market mover! Sorry to say but you're blindly raving :) 
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:14:59
People will have to focus on trading now instead of trolling :) 
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:02:25
Have you got your money back? In any form? At least a promise? :) 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:09:18
Poloniex is on the verge of insolvency... 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:58:50
In &gt;3years use I have newer had a single delay/problem with my withdrawal. Never. The same with Kraken. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:53:10
I did verification looong time ago, took 24 hours or maybe even less. Kraken support was the best one, they were so lightning fast so I called them 'best support ever'. Now they're ... patience please :) 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:21:42
Man, 199eur is quite expensive for a wallet, I got priorities in life. (imagine people from developing world would have to work like 3months to get a wallet :) 
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:35:54
Yesterday spoke to a friend who once had &gt;500 hundred bitcoins... He realises his mistake and now only advises to HOLD! My case similar... little by little i lost many BTC due to attempts to speculate, greed, many different reasons... Now hell NOBODY will take my btc. It can crash, burn, countries can ban it, fork it it I DONT CARE. Bitcoin will be BIG and thats a fact! In 10 years i dont to be a loser saying 'wish i have HODL!'
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:57:47
