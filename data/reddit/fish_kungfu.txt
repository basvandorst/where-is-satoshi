Pupper didn't know that was his kibble cash.

That was me.  Just getting ready to buy the OP a Christmas present.
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:43:24
Hooray, somebody got the joke!
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:53:01
Exactly!  And imagine if the unbanked of the world had access to decentralized global financial services and were empowered by that fearlessness.

Scrabble score value for the letters, "bitcoin" is: 11

Sadly, I think it's a reference to pay homage to a teenage Russian girl, Rina Palenkova, who committed suicide by throwing herself under a train on Dec 18, 2015.  Here is a YouTube tribute to her:

Me too.  I thought somehow he put himself on the Blockchain.  I guess you could put your DNA sequence on the BC.

Did the Australian auction dump have anything to do with this price plummet?
@_date: 2018-10-30 02:12:46
Pump and dump?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:05:18
Love it!
@_date: 2019-10-22 00:54:03
"run by bitcoin" doesn't even make sense.

Sadly, all they are "printing" is I.O.U.'s to the Quasi-Private Federal Reserve that We The Taxpayers have to pay back.  Suckass debt-based monetary system that we are slaves to.

Somehow, I bet that missing comma in "$1,000 000." is going to be his out.

It's beautiful bitcoin piece,  but what exactly is that?

Tim.  Tim.  Just stahp.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:00:02
Stay away, it will bite you.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:44:46
"BITCOIN CRASHES" should be, "BITCOIN CORRECTS".  It hurts either way.
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:49:59
YES!  You understand!  ;-P

Everything got screwed up when the establishment financial "experts" got involved.

Hahaha you got me!

What I've read is that money will be made from transaction fees alone.  By the time all of Bitcoin is mined (close to 2140, maybe earlier), the Bitcoin Caretakers may decide, against Satoshi's original design, to increase the Bitcoin supply.  Makes me sick to think that might happen though.  A lot can happen between now and then.
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:14:00
Bitcoin is not for the squeamish.  HODL brothers and sisters, HODL!!
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:45:47
This is why I NEVER EVER tell anyone to buy crypto.  I tell them it's extremely risky and volatile, BUT, if they do decide to buy, only use money you are willing to lose.  Would you spend that same money on lottery tickets?
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:04:01
OMG...did the time machine work?  Is this my future self with the low-down on The Bitcoin?  &lt;sends BTC&gt;
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:26:43
Exactly!  One should only buy crypto with money they don't mind losing.  I have zero sympathy for people who buy crypto with money they rely on.

LOL gross!  He did have a bath salts problem.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:53:25
LOL and he could do it!

I just wish Bitcoin would get over 9000 again.

Shhhhhh don't jinx it.  Just look the other way.
@_date: 2018-12-02 03:53:55
Tim, stahp. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:31:31
This explanation is really not good.
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:50:26
This is brilliant!!
