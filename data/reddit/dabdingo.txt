Isn't it possible to find out who owns that scam site and somehow getting your money back / report them to the police ? Or are .io websites anonymous?

BTW if you want to be super secure I hope you are using tor or a vpn for reddit right now since you're posting incriminating evidence and if you're buying a large amount it sounds like you're a reseller,law enforcement would love to have a word with you.
