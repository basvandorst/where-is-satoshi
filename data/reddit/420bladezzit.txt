Better than not being able to withdraw hopefully. Otherwise ill be jumping over and over until i find a decent exchange haha.

I just keep buying more because its on sale.

Sure did now half of my money is in bitcoin and half in lite. Made some good gains :)

Yeah basically I’m from uk so i need to sepa transfer with euros to a bank account. They then required me to deposit. So i did, waited a week and they still haven’t verified so i deposited again. Still it wont verify my bank account for withdrawing. This has been on going for 3 weeks so i have given up waiting for there support and jumped ship.

I wish i was, they money both times i deposited worked fine. They just wont verify for withdrawing :/ sucks.

Hahahahaha to true. Still im loving it. Only using money i can loose and i think of it more as a game.

Hahahahhaaha this. This is what i would do in a panic. But i decided id ride out litecoin untill a btc dip then buy half back in and hodl that and play with the other half in alt coins.

Heres hoping it proceeds upwards with the force of a thousand suns
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:12:22
Oh fuck. Maybe i have made a mistake. Haha

Very true, thats how im hoping things go at least. If more and more people invest the price will rise. So im hoping after the fork it booms again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:04:38
Off to a good start haha
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:58:37
Yeah i bought another 100, i like to take risks. This fork business seems like a good opportunity to make money amid the chaos.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:04:38
Yeah i don’t feel so bad as i didn’t pay for them so i never really lost anything. But i c ry inside knowing how much i could of had today if i wasn’t an idiot and seen value in bitcoin.
