Solved? Do you have your bitcoin now in your Balance on Gateio?

I think this guy is making up a story, it doesn't make sense. It is not how it works. Withdrawing triggers emails, etc as well. Just a guy that wants some attention.

It means the payment is valid and succesful. That would already be proven to be the case after 5 confirmations. So, the exchange did receive it. But, they do not list it on your balance. So, contact their support desk and send them the blockexplorer link, to proof that you have sent the money.

Check the address on the block explorer. Copy and paste in on blockchain.info
Last time, I had to wait for 8 days because I had applied a very low transaction fee.

Maybe refresh the BTC balance page on GateIO to make sure it is not a browser problem.

Then it should be at the destination address. Did you compare the destination address with the deposit address at the Exchange? No mistake made? If they are equal, send the blockeplorer link to the exchange-support as proof that your deposite was succesfull but not showing up in your balance at the Exchange.

Answer te question. Did you have 2FA enabled? This is relevant to others that have an account with Binance.

You need to look at the number of confirmations, if any. I believe you need at least 5 confirmations until
It will show at gate.io as confirmed
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:01:28
This should be Instant once confirmed on the Blockchain. You have your own unique bitcoin address with GateIO. So, it should already show because (meanwhile) you have hunderds of confirmations. Better to escalate this with GateIO.

You kept your seed offline, so you are safe. But as the other poster was saying, run an in-depth malware and virus scan on your computer to be sure that your computer is not infected.

Haha, LOL! Good one!

**SCAMMER ALERT!!**
Be careful with scammers on Reddit!
I also posted here a problem with CoinBase and was approached by **Coinbase\_Moderator**.
He asked me to call number +1 (757) 788-3550.
Careful! They are SCAMMERS!!
Don't give your info, don't go to the website they point you to, don't download software.
I almost fall for it. Watch out!

I am already 'busy' with Coinbase for 4 weeks and they only thing I talked to was a bot.
I think your best shot is when you call their support desk.

I see the phone is on flight mode. Switch it off and face the hard cold reality of today - after it did sync :)
