To play devils advocate (I am invested in crypto, but I think its important to be objective):


The exact same argument can be made for crypto, specifically Bitcoin. Crypto in general may well be 10-20 years ahead of its time. It certainly looks like it when we look at current use cases. Bitcoin is not usable as a day-to-day currency. Ethereum's biggest working use-case is digital kittens. I would guess 80-90% of altcoins are hot-air, or straight up scams.
Of course, these problems have proposed solutions. But as mainstream is quickly adopting, and big money is starting to roll in, it may already be too late for these major crypto's to deliver, despite there being real value in them. If trust is lost in the market and the mainstream pulls out, it will look exactly like the dot-com bubble, will it not?

Who cares, Wikileaks is a propaganda front.
For the russian apologists -
* Wikileaks personally reach out to Donald Trump Jr -
* Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov - “maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.”
* Wikileaks selling 'dicking bimbos' shirts
It is pretty clear boys. Where are the "Putin is jailing the gays" shirts?
And if you do want some juicy unproven claims to cry over, suck on this:
Russia is heavily investing in cryptocurrency, not because they support the technology, but because it threatens the West's financial stability. And creating that instability is their moda operandi and geo-political strategy. They will undermine and manipulate the crypto world, just as the big banks will, for their own political gain.

Just because the value proposition (an improved currency over fiat) is more direct with bitcoin compared to dot.com companies, it doesn't change the fact that delivery of that platforms value may be slow, and miss its timing window for the mainstream.
A bubble is only a bubble when it fails to deliver on the market's expectations. So we must examine Bitcoin's value and when it can deliver that value.
Currently, in terms of value:
 
* Bitcoin is not a usable day-to-day currency
* Has a plan to fix one issue with this, the Lightning network.
* The timing of this is 6-12 months assuming no problems.
* Mainstream is rapidly adopting Bitcoin. Futures, regulation, big investments flowing in
* Other problems with Bitcoin as a mainstream currency that yet to have solutions: volatility for example.
* If a series of unfortunate events destroys investors trust, They will bail.
* Bubble pops.

i meant a series of bad events with bitcoin development. For example
 * Big mainstream investors have put money in Bitcoin
 * Big players attempt to manipulate market
 * Volatility in market prices
 * Random exchange vulnerability found, trading closes briefly on big exchange
 * Big investors decide to move/reduce portfolio
 * More volatility, slower tx times
 * Big investors are introduced to the massive tx times as they move/reduce
 * Exit strategy compromised, bad investment, execute full bail
 * Pop
Of course, this lacks nuance. But the point is, a dot.com like scenario is possible if we get unlucky.
