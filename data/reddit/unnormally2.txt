I think what you mean is: Discount bitcoin!

Take one for the team!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:18:18
Yes, up to certain limits depending on the payment method you are using and if you provided ID, that might raise your limits.  If you type $100 into the field, then you will pay exactly $100.  They will take their fee out of that amount, and the rest will go into the currency of your choice at the rate shown.  You will get a confirmation page which is your last chance to agree or back out.  If you buy with credit card, there are higher fees, but you get your bitcoin immediately.  If you pay with a bank account, it will take about a week to get your bitcoin, but the price is locked in when you place an order, and the fees are lower.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:03:56
Heh, if it hit 1.2k it would be Christmas with all the discount bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:01:58
yet to be seen.  I bought in like 5 days ago, so I'm a Hodl newbie.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:36
What would you do if it never dips?  Or goes to 20k, then dips to 15k?
Sell if you want out, otherwise HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:48
Sure.  It's all a balance of risk/reward.  How much are you willing to risk, how much do you want to get out of your investment?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:41:57
Is it even worth investing in the other currencies like Etherium?  They just seem to follow bitcoin, so what's the point in diversifying if they just do the same thing?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:06
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:58
HODL means "Hold On (for) Dear Life" or it's just a meme'd misspelling of "Hold".  Reminding us to not panic sell, and just hold onto your bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-04 14:32:28
The only thing I don't really understand with coinbase is that the buy price is higher than the price on their charts at any given moment.  Is that price including the fee?  Or is the fee on top of that higher price?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:18:01
Chill dude.  This is why we ask questions.  Not everyone can understand all the details of this shit.  No need to get so angry.
Even if it's not illegal, it can still be a reason for users to leave coinbase, if they are displeased with the site's actions.

"to continue reading this article..." fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:45:38
Also, they aren't actually trading these right?  It's magic future mumbo jumbo?  Because there's ones with like 900,000 BTC, which would be like 14 billion dollars worth getting thrown around.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:42
Yea, it's really bogged down.  Give it time.  Understandably when the price is going up so much right now.  Glad I placed another order this morning when the price was ~16k
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:10:20
Pwahhahaha, every time I'm like "Oh, I should get some more bitcoin while it's down"
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:37:27
They are borrowing bitcoin from someone, with the promise to return that bitcoin in the future.  If the price goes down, they can return it cheaper, and the money they saved is profit.  If the price goes up, they have to pay extra to return it, so they lose money.
It's more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:36:47
Well, we don't know what the price or the situation will be then.  I think you are better off saving the money for your own unexpected expenses.  You are still very young and it's a good idea to have money set aside for unexpected things.  But if you insist on investing it into bitcoin or anything else, yea, it will probably be fine to invest whenever you have the money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:08
I know, it's rough.  I felt the same way when I bought in at 10k.  Could it go down?  Will it go up?  You never know.  Stay strong and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:20:52
It's definitely scary.  I got the HODL and SELL sitting on my shoulders right now "SELL SELL SELL!"  "HODL! HODL!"  But the question is... which one is the devil and which one is the angel?  We can't know until it's too late.  Until we can look back in hindsight, and see if the market continues to do well (Either rising or eventually settling at a high price), or will the market plummet, and it would be wise to dump now.  No way to know.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:45:45
That's a marketing trick, not anything to do with inflation.  You have to look at the price by weight.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:52
We can stop celebrating each milestone when it's not such a big deal.  Every 1k is a huge deal at this point.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:09
Yea.  Kinda disappointed I put a little into both of them last week.  I can duck out with minimal losses.  The problem is I just don't have any confidence that they would recover, not when Bitcoin is dominating the crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:03
As best as I understand it, they are betting against bitcoin.  If the price goes down, they make money.  It's more complicated than that, but I'm not an expert.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:36:59
Calm down.  Only you can decide what to do.
As for me.  I may stop buying more BTC for the moment and let my transactions clear.  And by that time I'll have to make a judgement call if I think the price will crash or not.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:18:32
I'm sorry for their loss, but that's how it goes.  Bet against bitcoin and YOU LOSE.

I'm sorry, I was distracted by the penis.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:22:51
I'm not raging, personally.  But I bought in earliest at around 10k, and averaging around 13k/coin for all my purchases.  So it's up, but I also bought some bitcoin more recently, as high as 15.5k, I think.  And that's where it get's a little touchier.  Or the money I put into etherium, and it's mostly stagnating.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:04:23

I'm... not sure.  I would think if your income was under a certain bracket you don't pay any taxes, but 1. this is in the US, I don't know UK law, and 2. I don't know if that applies to capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:25:11
You think so?  I bought some ETH and LTC recently, and it's just been disappointing.  I know it's been going up with BTC before that, but in this past week, they've been suffering, and I wonder if that will continue.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:47:27
Use bank transfer and it's like a 5k-10k limit, and lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:16
I'm guessing the server is getting bogged down right now.  Keep checking your accounts tab and see if the transaction shows up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:54:54
I went to buy more and I caught it briefly dipping to 15k before jumping up to 15.5k.  Good shit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:44:21
Yea, some people in this thread are really confusing me.  I agree with what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:19
I don't even watch GOT and that was what I thought too.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:27:52
It's not profit until you sell it off.  And I have been HODLing it as the smart thing to do is.  I am absolutely prepared to wait years and I am aware of the historical price of bitcoin.
And I didn't say I was unhappy.  Of course I'm happy.  I just get a little nervous when it drops off a bit and I came in at this relatively high price.  Maybe I would feel different if I had bought in when it was $1000 or less, and I already had a mountain of bitcoin to sit on.  But I think it's reasonable to have some apprehensions about the long term effects of things that may impact the price of bitcoin, like futures.  Fortunately, in this case, it seems to have not been a big deal, but you never know.


That's uncalled for.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:24
Nobody knows what is best.  We don't know when it may dip, or by how much.  As always, if you want to invest, I would get some now and get more slowly over the coming days.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:45
What if someone you know saw your post and considered stealing the wallet?  It's always safer to never reference how much you have.

@_date: 2017-12-09 05:54:36
Pretty much.  As much as I *think* the price will drop.  I don't know for sure, and I can't bring myself to sell right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:25:46
How do you calculate capital gains when you buy and sell at different levels?  Do you just cost average everything?  Like, if I bought 1 BTC at 10k, and 1 at 11k.  Then sell 1 BTC at 12k.  My cost average is 10.5k per BTC, and my gain is 12k-10.5k = 1.5k.  Is that correct?
Might get weird if I start trading between cryptocurrencies...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:43
It's hard to say.  Another possibility is that they try to sell off and drop the price, but enough people are buying that it doesn't drop as much as they want, and end up losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:34:38
Unless you catch it in the 2 minute drop, you missed it.  I invested as soon as I could earlier today and it quickly surpassed that price.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:42:29


I have not seen anyone saying that taxes are not used for those purposes, or that the government just prints money for that.  I think it is very well understood that taxes are used for services such as that (Among other things obviously)

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:14:54
I say, play halfsies.  Put some money in now and steadily add more over the coming days.  If you do catch a significant drop in price, that's a good time to invest some extra, but otherwise don't go crazy.  Waiting is a good way to make regrets.  I could have waited for a dip back at 10k, but look where we are now!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:42:44
Because you can't predict when, if, and how much a correction will be.  What if you sell off now, the price goes to 30k, and then "Crashes" to 20k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:46
Well, the price has never risen 30x in 3 days.  Bitcoin is making bank right now, but not THAT much.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:47:06
But what about an increase in demand?  Wouldn't that lead to higher prices, possibly compensating for efficiency deflation?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:25:52
There's always the chance it will never recover, but I believe that it can endure.  Or, it takes a long time to recover.  After the drop in 2013, it took 4 years to recover.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:04:16
I bought just last week, and it's already up a fair bit.  Invest sensibly, and don't wait.  If it dips and you can invest then, great, but don't wait and hope it does so.  I suggest investing steadily until you reach whatever total amount you choose to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:10:28
I know, but if it dips, I want to sink more money into it. :D  Otherwise I'll just have to do regular investments and dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:06:54
How do people feel about Etherium and Litecoin?  Despite Bitcoin's success at the moment, ETH and LTC seem to be stagnating.  What's the deal?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:41
I bought in a week ago, and it's already like 70% gains.  Lets hope it will last.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:46:15
I got in last week and it's up 70%.  Now is the time
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:21:08
Sure.  HODL is good as long as you believe BTC will never permanently fail.  And personally, I do not it would fail so spectacularly.  Now, can the price drop or crash?  Sure.  But I do think it can recover in the long run.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:53:40
This is probably also worth 1 pizza.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:39:22
I have not seen anyone here make those claims.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:07:53
This guy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:48:54
It really does just sound like gambling in that case. XD
At least with us HODLers we have the asset in question.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:13:13
Predict exactly when it's going to go up or down?  No.  But we wouldn't invest if we thought it was going to go down.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:41:45
I don't see why not.  If you are taxed for your BTC gains, then you can claim losses all the same.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:25:25
I still read it as "hold"...
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:44:00
I mean, it depends on the timescale.  I think it's reasonable if you were invested years ago and now that the investment has exploded, you can use that money to great effect to pay off debt or get your life in order.  That seems like a great use for it!  And I don't feel that it's silly that they didn't HODL for years to come looking for the 'moon'.  When will we hit the moon?  How will we know?  Is the moon $100k?  $1 million?  What if the moon comes and goes before settling at something much lower and people miss the moon entirely?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:42:23
Ahhhhh, ok.  So you don't need money for the full value of the bitcoin, just enough to cover whatever margin you agree to.  And then you close it either when the price drops, or when the price rises, but before the margin will no longer be able to cover for the price.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:18:27


@_date: 2017-12-09 06:08:07
Ok, funny thing.  I had some Chinese food today, ate the fortune cookie, but didn't read the fortune at the time.  Checked it now, and it was "Financial prosperity is coming your way", and then this happens.  Feelsgoodman.  Let's hope the magic fortune cookie works for all next week too.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:47:34
I get what you are saying, but I think if there is any sort of reduced consumerism involved with bitcoin, it only affects this slim margin of early adopters.  I think most people won't change their habits at all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:22
Well good news to you at the moment...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:04
Meh.  I missed out on selling because I wasn't sure if or how much it would dip.  But I'm fine with waiting longer.  I'll just buy more when I think the price has bottomed out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:52
You *can* get a sexbot for 1 BTC tho.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:55:36
I don't see how this changes anything.  Aren't you still just reporting your gains?  So whether it's BTC to ETH to USD to LTC or whatever, you are still paying the same amount, from what I understand.  Though you may pay sooner rather than later, if you were trading between currencies before.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:24:10
Ahhh, that moment the price broke 17k again.  Feelsgoodman.

How did you pay for it and on what site?  Coinbase?  Did you do a bank transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:51
I did hear someone mention there might be???  But I think it more has to do with hype, the futures, and lightning somethingorother.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:32:06
You are assuming the inflow is the same over an entire 24 hour cycle?  I mean, what if that 6 hour chunk of time you chose to examine is the high point, or the low point of the day?  That would throw your numbers off.

ZOMG PANIC, SELL AT A LOSS.  Bitcoin dead 4ever! /s
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:43:10
You would not be able to do anything with the BTC until it arrives in your account.  The price could start crashing and you would be stuck until you actually had the BTC.
The flipside of this, is that when the price goes up, you still pay the price of the BTC at the time you ordered it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:04:30
Ah, I see, and what happens the week after that?  And what are tomorrow's lottery numbers while you're at it?

Oh?  Ok.  I thought they were basically the same thing.  Money is hard.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:57:34
Haha, too true.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:24:20
If you want to invest more, any downfall is just more opportunity to buy up bitcoin cheaper.  And it helps contribute to keep the price up.  I will probably get more if that's the case.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:55
Oh god it's getting faster.  By the end of 2018, 1 BTC might buy the universe...
Wait, what happens if the value rolls over?  Does it go to 0 or negative values?  Hmm...
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:41:00
I've seen that graph.  We'll see.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:02:56
I hope not.  Coinbase locked me out because I'm a new user and it wants to wait until my first transaction finishes before I can get more.  So if the price dips I'm stuck until then. \&gt;.\&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:13:31
Coinbase is very easy to get into.  It's probably not the best method.  But certainly easy.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:54:53
Great.  Glad to see it's going up.  I mean, this is why I left the money there, rather than taking it back out at a $0 gain.  Also jesus christ litecoin.  Glad I dumped a bunch of money into that yesterday at the "high" price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:40

@_date: 2017-12-09 05:48:28
I know, it is tempting... and I'm considering that too.  Though it may be a self fulfilling prophecy.  We sell off, and then the price drops because we sold off.  On the other hand, we don't fully understand what will happen with these shorts.  Maybe the price won't drop, or even go up?  I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:16:34

Buy now!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:34
The best time to buy is now.  The best time to buy MORE, is if the market corrects. :P
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:47:39
Bought in around 10k.  BTC didn't disappoint.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:33:17
I don't know, but 18k+ sounds too high at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:39:02
If it drops.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:23:12
Exactly.  I don't have any threshold where I will sell automatically.  In fact, if I caught one of those big drops like we saw today I would probably buy as much as I can.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:20:35
We expect there will be a big selloff from wall street, trying to cause a cascade of selloffs.  If that happens they will make a ton of money from their shorting.  What we need to do is stay strong, and don't get scared off.  Bitcoin will do fine, and any price dip is temporary.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:55:40
As bitcoin gets used more, we may see easier and cheaper ways to use it, even for people who do not have smart phones.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:01:04
Makes sense.  Yea, I would always expect some people to sell off at various thresholds.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:21:06
I don't remember doing any weird verification like that, and I made my account just last week.  Maybe there's less verification if you link it to a bank account?  Were you trying to link a credit card?
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:19:29
This is exactly what I was thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:51:29
I guess.  It depends on the angle the review is taking.  Whether it's a customer review, or a professional one.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:31:35
As a new investor, it hurts a little every time the price goes up.  "Should I have bought more bitcoin already?"  "Am I being too cautious?"  I was hoping there would be more of a downturn to let me buy in a little cheaper, but it's not happening.  So I'm buying steadily, but I'm not thrilled about it.  The only thing I can hope for is that it just keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:51
Get your investment where you want it, then stop watching the price. Just leave it, and come back in a few months.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:38
We all accept that risk when we buy.  I bought in shortly after it peaked at 10k, but it kept going.  We just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:38:44
a gif
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:47:50
Careful, they might be counterfeit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:21:51
You know, I'm disappointed.  I looked it up just now and realized that Nigeria doesn't have princes.  They have a government very similar to the USA, with an elected president.
I was hoping that there were real Nigerian princes who had a hard time getting taken seriously via email.
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:11:58
This is a bit of an exaggeration.  I don't really get any fees and I do get a little bit of interest.
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:12:21


It doesn't work that way, lol
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:32:45
I dunno.  I didn't have much issue with Coinbase.  I sent them a scan of my Driver's license and got verified right away, and was able to send my coins to gdax and off to my wallet, no issue.
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:24:30
They are still labeled by country.  United States Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, and so on.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:41:06
Right?  I was pretty sure Zimbabwe bux failed a long while ago.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:03
Well, its inevitable.  As the price drops enough, more people want to buy discounted bitcoin, so at some point it stabilizes.  We'll see how much and how quickly it recovers.
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:42:44
25% have been lost?  That much?  Wow.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:44:09
I do admit it probably feels pretty cool to have a gold bar in your safe.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:41:04
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:33:22
Bitcoin, 70% off!? :O /s
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:31:25
Hmm... I'm not sure.  I mean, we can divide a coin all the way down to it's satoshi's, so it's not like there wouldn't be enough to go around.  I would presume value would go up with scarcity, unless it becomes inconvenient to use or obsolete in some way.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:57:05
oooh, haven't seen this rollercoaster meme before.  Rocket powered this time.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:21:06
I think you mean, *discount bitcoin!*
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:07:58
Every day, I'm like "Oh crap, I wish I bought some more yesterday!" or "Oh good, the price is going down.  I was right not to buy in" XD
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:09:19
I certainly wouldn't mind more discount bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:02:02
Yea, honestly, I'm a little relieved.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:16:56
Sneaky sneaky.  He could have done more to hide his banner and bio to be convincing.  I guess he'll still fool some people.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:02:39
Ok, but you promised!  If we divide a pizza ~25-30 ways, it's not much, but it will be delicious!
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:51:37
It's all a matter of what you can buy.  My dollar has not drastically gone down in value in the past year, so yes, bitcoin is going up.
Oh, but keep memeing anyway, it's fun. :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:41:23
Yea, I dunno.  I checked on the price and I didn't see any crazy drop like in the picture, unless it's an older picture.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:39:58
"Trounces stocks, bonds, gold and oil"  Yes, after an equally cataclysmic drop.  I'll start celebrating when we get past the old peak.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:04:46
You only lose money if you sell.  I bought some at around 16k too, but I've never sold it.  Eventually (Fingers crossed) we'll be back in the stratosphere and everything will be green again.
@_date: 2019-06-10 12:21:22
Tomorrow, BTC will either go up, or go down.  That's my prediction.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:33:14
Well, of course inflation exists.  But I'm just saying that this particular rise in bitcoin is not a function of fiat devaluing.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:14:21
Some, yes.  As much as I should have?  Probably not.
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:00:08
There's nothing wrong with dreaming of reaching the moon.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:49:54
What if the meltdown is a bitcoin crash?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:57:03
Haha, yea.  We all make mistakes.  I delayed and I delayed, and I didn't get more bitcoin when it was at 3k.  Finally got some more when it was up to 7k, but that's how these things go.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:57:23
I had a friend ask to help him mine bitcoin very early on, (2008?).  I don't know how much he actually mined, I'm not in contact with him anymore, but I would have had something at least.  I'd like to imagine he had thousands and is rolling in cash now.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:14:18
You missed the next step.  Bitcoin vs God
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:27:20
I always understood it as: You pay a fee to borrow the bitcoin, or stock or whatever, and you have to return the bitcoin at a certain time in the future.  So you sell the bitcoin, hope the price goes down so you can buy it back cheap, return the bitcoin, and make a profit!  You win, the guy who got the fee wins, and the guy who bought the bitcoin loses, I guess. :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:00:27
Yea, I heard someone talking about GDAX so I was already planning on looking into that.  Someone recommended Electrum to me so I signed up for that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:43:14
If you really want to, I would recommend talking to your parents about it and set up an account through them until you're 18, and then transfer the bitcoin to your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:41:29
Didn't he hear?  HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:35:17
What's wrong with electronic wallets like Electrum?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:54:33
Hmm... maybe if it was entirely in their name (And they would have to pay taxes if you made gains) and then they gift it to you in 2 years that would be fine?  I can't imagine you have so much money to put into Bitcoin that it would be a problem, but I'm not an expert on this.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:25:09
An oldie but goodie
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:20:44
Dammit, I'm excited, but at the same time, going up this fast is scary.  Feels like it could pop and go back down in an instant.
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:16:49
You might want a little more if you want waterfront property on the Moon.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:46:23
It's only sad when it goes down if A. You need that money in the near future, in which case, it was dumb to invest it.  B. You were hoping to buy and sell frequently for a quick buck. or C.  You think Bitcoin would never recover, or recover too slowly.
Well, I think even if Bitcoin crashes soon, it would recover, and I'm not investing money I can't afford to tie up in bitcoin, so any drops just means more opportunities for investment.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:10:31
I'm sure he'll miss that 1 karma.  You got 'em.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:21:17
I am suspicious, but who knows.  Maybe it drops back down, maybe it doesn't.  You never know with these things.  I wouldn't be hasty to panic buy on the way up though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:40:27
Haha, absolutely.  I'm a new buyer, and I have to really resist the temptation to check the price every 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:27:16
What's a small amount? 0.01 BTC? 0.1 BTC? 1 BTC? 10 BTC?  And why can't GDAX handle larger amounts?  I'm also a little concerned about the $ limit on coinbase.  What if I want to move more than that in a week?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:46:51
So you would report just the difference between the sell price and what you bought it for, right?  And if you sold at a loss you can deduct that loss from your taxable income as well, I believe?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:52:35
So, I signed up for a wallet (And got my first bitcoin) just the other day.  The idea would be to move the bitcoin from Coinbase to the wallet after every transaction?  Is there any delay moving between the two that I would need to consider when  selling?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:00:48
It bounced back.  I'm in the same boat as you.  Though I didn't put much money in at the moment, so I'm not too worried if it does drop.  In fact, if it does, all the better for me to buy in!
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:53:46
I'm not that invested in Bitcoin yet (I bought my first yesterday), so I'm like "GO LOWER, LOWER!"
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:10
Bought in just over 10k, it's ok though because I wasn't an idiot and only put a little in to start and feel out the market.  I will hodl, wait and see, and invest from there.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:12:42
I, too, know how to stretch lines until they overlap.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:57:05
I mean, I had to enter the last 4 digits of my SSN when I made my account the other day.  Or was that when I linked my Bank?  It was kinda a blur, I was in a rush to get everything set up, between that and a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:39:15
I bought my first just over 10k, mostly to get my feet wet and for the long term, so if it drops, it will suck, but I'm not gonna sell off.  In fact, if it does drop, I'll probably get more. :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:19
Oh, I guess.  I already bought some bitcoin the other day, so I don't know how much it's going to help me "Learn the system" at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:48:57
Or if someone else is paying for the electricity.  Back in the day my friend set up computers in college to mine, and of course the college is paying for the electricity.  Gotta offset that tuition somehow I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:17:40
Don't put in money you can't afford to lock up in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:18:10
You don't have a password?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:01:14
Doesn't coinbase have higher fees though?  I used a bank transfer, since that was of course a much lower fee than buying with credit, but if GDAX is zero fees, that sounds pretty nice.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:55:38
Is moonbit even worth it?  Looking into it now, what's a few hundred or thousand satoshi even?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:42:34
oooh so spoopy and mystreus
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:26:40
I'd imagine only to a trained jeweler's eye.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:42:50
Really?  People were telling me NOT to keep your money in coinbase, use a wallet, and GDAX instead.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:31
Ok.  I just get a text code when I log in to authenticate.  If I lost my phone, I would get a new phone with my same phone number and then authenticate using that phone, or am I wrong?  Also, when I logged in on my computer I checked that box saying that I don't need to use the authenticator when logging into my home PC for 30 days.  So even without my phone I would be able to log in for a while.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:00:21
Someone bet that the price would go down.  It didn't, and now they're losing a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:32:38
I bought my first bitcoin yesterday.  Missed the dip, but I only put a little in for now.  Interested to see what happens and I'll go from there.  I do think there is a significant chance it might dip below 9k again, and if that's the case I'll buy more then.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:39:46
In the next 5 years, unlikely.  But the dollar will continue to inflate, and the value of bitcoin will go up steadily (Well, it'll jump all over the fuck place, but steadily when you zoom out).  So it'll get there eventually.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:53:55
I compare prices by weight, so smaller packages are annoying, but not a concern.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:23:11
And now the bills are actually worth something.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:29:18
Don't you get half her shit too though?  Don't get me wrong, I understand that divorce courts are skewed to favor women, but assuming you're incomes are both relatively similar, it wouldn't be as bad as "you lose half your shit"
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:27:36
So stupid.  It would be like if banks could get in trouble because someone withdrew some money and spent it on drugs.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:29:35
Well, honey badgers are very tough animals.  Thick hide and fur makes them resistant to all the dangerous animals in their habitat.  But they also know no fear, and will be very aggressive towards animals that you would think it wouldn't, like lions.  Those fucking things are terrifying.
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:34:04
down from an ATH of 200k.
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:51:36
Of course, reported and blocked.  I'm not so stupid as to click on that shit, lol.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:01:01


Oh yea... easy... I'll get right on that... right after I get any date at all
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:17:12
Quick!  Short BTC so it keeps going up!
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:38:52
I'm well aware, I've read plenty of MRA stuff or over in TheRedPill.
@_date: 2019-04-24 11:18:45
Hard to say. 120 years is a long time for things to change.  Think of where we were at in year 1900 compared to today.  Maybe we'll have come up with something even better than bitcoin by then.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:54:48
Yea, I've been moving my coins to a wallet as possible.  I had a bit of a hitch when I had to verify my GDAX account, which needed a picture of my drivers license.  I didn't have a good camera, but eventually I got a scan of it, and that worked great.  I still need to set up a LTC and ETH wallet tho.  I thought my other wallet would handle all three, but turns out it's only BTC.  Ah well.
Otherwise, had no problems withdrawing my BTC.  Send to GDAX from coinbase, send from GDAX to wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:35:00
Bitcoin turns into bottlecaps
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:21:52
Simpsons did it first, every time.
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:26:33
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.  At least when comparing gold and silver you have to consider that they have different uses as well.
@_date: 2018-11-13 04:04:44
Well that's just standard anti-scam procedure.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:19:56
I have to confess... I didn't HODL...
I bought even MORE BTC at the bottom!  Bring on the lamborgini's!
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:15:29
I dunno.  I'm hedging my bets on no change.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:09:18
We're all on the roller coaster together
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:30:40
RIP.  For my sake, I hope you're right.  Because I'm selfish.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:36:43
Just a billion!?  I'll set a goal for TEN billion customers!
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:35:17
I bought some more today.  May as well considering all my other holdings were bought above $10k price! XD
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:32:07
This is unprecedented levels of crashing!  Who thought it was possible to start another crash while you are already crashing!?
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:58:27
I do statistic work with simulations for my job, and we do 10 billion simulations.  Even then there is a great deal of uncertainty.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:48:22
Whew man, feels good to have bought at 6300.  Almost offsets the suffering I feel for having bought at 18000+...
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:51:15
The better question.  When does the $ become worthless, and BTC buys all the Lamborghinis? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:12:15
mfw when I bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:58:59
Yea, I got some lucky timing, buying right around $6300.  It's not over until I have my Lamborghini.
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:59:56
Please follow the law.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:22:01
Never short bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:33:14
It could reach $1 billion if I wish hard enough.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:20:35
Dont look at it, dont look at it, dont look at it, dont look at it... fuck, I looked.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:20:07
Yea, still sucks when you got into bitcoin at the other end of that 50% swing.  I'll HODL, but I won't be happy until I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Plus, as much as I'd like to invest more with the price down, I can only afford to put so much in without being reckless.  I might try to get a little more over time, but nothing like I was before.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:30:57
It's like that GIF where there's an organized team specifically out to pump/dump whenever it's worst for you.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:35:22
Ooh.  That's pretty sneaky/clever/evil.  I mean, I guess you should know what you are getting into when you are margin trading.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:20:22
Worth rocks too.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:14:47
I had gains very briefly, for the one set of crypto I sold at a high point.  The rest I have held, so I can't report that until it is sold.  So I reported that gain.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:21:18
Yea, just be careful about the hype.  I may have bought some now, but I also bought some when it was at 15k. XD  It sucks, but I have faith it will go back up in time.  My only fear is that something comes out that crushes bitcoin, but at this point I'm not too worried.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:10:21
Well, you'd probably have to account for the increase in value in BTC from when you bought it, to when you 'sold' it for gold.  And then pay taxes on that.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:30:35
I have some Etherium too, but I'm not as enthusiastic about it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:56:25
Notto diso shitto agen
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:06:18
phresh phish!
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:19:17
Don't worry, we can push it even lower!
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:34:40
Sure, it's not how many dollars can I get for 1 bitcoin, but rather how many Lamborghinis?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:38:37
As the saying goes.  The best time to buy was yesterday.  The next best time is now.  It may be worthwhile to buy a little at a time, without regard to the current price, and just rely on dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:33:45
Jesus, I was scared when it had dropped, but it's already past that point.  Glad I bought a little more.  I'm still a fool for putting it off when Bitcoin was ~4k, but I'll take what I can get.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:17:19
Do they deliver Lamborghinis to the moon?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:14:47
Vegeta, what does the scouter say about Bitcoin's power level?
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:51:19
I am someone who would use his new patreon-like site, using bitcoin.
