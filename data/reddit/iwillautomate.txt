I WAS TOLD THERE WOULD BE DIP ON THE MONDAY!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:40:32
I was told there would be huge dip on Monday. Why is this still climbing up. :&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:38:46
I started with 1 bitcoin. Then by buy buying and selling (once a week or once every two week) I managed to increase to 1.12BTC until this past weekend. I sold at 6019. Been waiting for the dip. Now I am even convinced to buy it back from the same price:)) Still hoping it is gonna go down. But it just passed 6600 currently.

Bought the dip. Was online and watching the price when it hit 5500. Been pretty happy since then:p

Yep. I aint one of those people to "Live fast, die young. So your corpse will be beautiful" i am gonna die old and ugly.

Asking a question. No matter how stupid it is to you, it is a legit question to me. I want to understand someting. If you dont want to answer then gtfo. You dont have to insult me for asking a question. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:49
This reply even shows how much you frickin believe there will not be only 21m btcs. When the day comes, and they decide to change the 'code' or whatever, you will just accept like a sheep. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:32:28
Did you actually sit down and make this calculation after me writing a simple question 3 weeks ago. You seriously need to get a life. 
Oh, by the way. You wanna check the price of BTC ($5842). Big boy. Get a life, please. You wanna "hodl" your 0.02 BTC. Do it. Stop trying to humiliate me and prove me wrong. GET A LIFE. :) 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:48:55
That's what has been bugging me. How do you know that when the day comes, the 'developers' decide to change the hardcoded 21million limit to increase the amount. Is there some sort of 100% assurance there is never ever ever will not me 21,000,001 bitcoin, no matter who and which communities comes together to change it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:39:49
The question is not WHY. The question is, is there any way to do it. If there is, it is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:18:53
Okay. Thank you for the answer. That is all I wanted to know.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:07:37
Thats okay. It happens. Bit is rocketing, we are all happy.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:48:55
I am on the btc's side. Lets hope that is what happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:06:57
Someone is definitely mad.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:18:52
hahah, what the hell.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:59:24
how low do you think it is going to dip, if you think it is a dead cat bounce?

You definitely summarized my past 3 weeks with Bitcoin. Sometimes I had to panic buy or sell and lose some money. I am new to Bitcoin (3-4 weeks ~) But I am still up almost $2000 comparing to what I had invested in. If I was not greedy and sold at 5850 this week and bought back at 5500(and this happened 4-5 times this week 5750-5500) I would have made at least another $1000. (also if my uncle had tits, he would be my aunt i know :&gt; ) i am just trying to make a point.
It just doesn't make sense just buy and hold while some people are making crazy money on it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:54:28
I think he might be just using 'limit order' from his account. am i right 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:14:42
But whyy?? Anyone can explain this in a logical way. Why the fuk it jumped $300 in an hour...
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:16:56
Gemini $10-12/btc to buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:44:54
Not going to lie that did happen. :)
And i didnt know about the shirt term capital gains tax etc. I guess it is not worth buy-sell small amounts. I'll just buy more when I think it dips like todays $5085 etc. 
But i always have the feeling one day we are gonna wake up to nothing in our hands somehow. still not 100% convinced that some several frekin billionaries are not gonna mess up the whole thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:33:09
I am pretty new too. I am using my gemini account. It  seems to be pretty fast &amp; responsive for the last 3 weeks that i've been on. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:10:09


Jokes on you, you are wrong again. I actually bought at 5100. LMAO. 
I don't do it(buy/sell) several times a day. Sometimes not even every day. Hell, it has been only 3 weeks since I started doing this, and 4 weeks I bought my first bit of bitcoin.
You are an informative fella. But the way you write is very offensive. I am just asking a question, and you start with "How can you be so STUPID". lol'd at work.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:08:10
I don't get the just hodl technique. Why not try to sell high and buy more BTC when it dips. It is definitely better than just hodling in my opinion. edit:typo
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:39:37
You funny you:&gt;
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:26:30
I use Gemini. I don't know about other sites but it already cuts fees before even buying or selling.
What I do is risky and I lost some money ($20-30 several times), but I lose it from my profit and I don't really care.
For example (random numbers) if i had 5 bitcoins, i sold them at 5300 this morning and wait to see if it is going to drop or not. If I am lucky it drops and I buy back in more bitcoin from 5100. After that point I don't care if it drops more because I already have more BTC comparing to before rather then just HODLing it. 
If I am not lucky it goes up to 5350, and I either wait for another day or just panic buy and lose $50 worth of bitcoin.
I don't know if it is really stupid or not. But I have more BTC then I started so it seems to be working with little luck and patience. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:29:04
Aaalrightyyy then. You need to chill your tits. 
At the end of 2-3 weeks of doing this, and having MORE bitcoin and MORE account value I don't see how this is stupid.
Btw you were wrong with your guesses too.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:44:51
It is both combined. And my goal is to not to have more $$ but to have more BTC which seems to be working alright. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:12:50
People say Bitcoin may fail but Blockchain will revolutionize the way we trade. If that happens then bitcoin might not be worth that much I guess? I own bitcoin, I hope that doesn't happen but it might be the case?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:32:51
Lol Yeah I am just learning it too. Long term goal is to HODL but why not make more BTC on the way to HODLing. Of course it comes with its risks as you mentioned, but I guess depends on the people. Whatever works for the individual.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:20:48
Gemini seemas to be pretty legit. But i still am afraid sometimes. Bought a trezor but still didnt move my btcs to there yet.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:00:19
I got my bitcoin on gemini. And I am pretty new to cryptocurrency. Does the gemini has this, -what you are talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:31:36
I actually didn't know about that. It was thinking it would be same as if I just hold 5 BTC that I bought, or make it a 5.5BTC at the end of the year. I just hold the bitcoin. As long as I hold it as a Bitcoin, it would be same? If I am wrong, then it most certainly is NOT worth trying to buy and sell several times a week...
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:38:37
He is informative, but too salty. That first several sentences...
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:22:21
You say no one is selling but around 40 hours ago it dropped $750. Now it is back up even more. I wonder what will be the next dip amount be. It's crazier then roller coaster rides.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:49:58
I bought a trezor. But i am just trying to buy low and sell high, just to make more bitcoin with what I have. I have had several small fail panic sells/buys, but overall i am still on the profit side. 
If i just keep the bitcoin on Gemini, do i need to do anything else to get the forked BTC? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:29:43
Whatever dude. Thanks for the good wishez. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:31:29
Transaction cost on gemini is around 10-12/btc i dont think it is that high for hundreds of dollars. But you are right on the first part. It didnt increase 500+ onme but i had to panic buy after 30-40$ in.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:34:11
If there is no reason behind it to go up like crazy, then tomorrow there is no reason it to become worthless as shit.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:29:46


how old are you? just curious, bcz you said you are retired
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:32:42
Anyone knows what the hell is going on right now. Bitcoin was 4700 an hour ago now it passed even 4800. Anyone can guess if it is going to take a huge dive back? I'm kinda new, and I saw 4500 to 3200, and back to 4800. Edit: 4860 already. WTH
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:43:54
What the hell is going on. Is it going to dip. Any insights:))
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:15:05
wtf happened?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:08:25
I don't understand this. What is going on. It jumped $300 in 1 hour. WTH. :toot:
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:22:03
If i buy and sell, but hold all the money as  more btc at the end of the year do i still have to pay taxes on thoze?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:33:44
But be careful about the volatility and the hatred around here. :)
