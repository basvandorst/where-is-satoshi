I Pay 1.6% already with TD, so this doesn't really save much.
CFIB and chambre of commerce members already pay 1.6%, but most merchants that do not go threw them (and not represented by some body unless they are bitg in size such as best buy) pay 2% or more.

extra 1.5% yikes. PayPal payments pro is cheaper. My customer does not pay an extra % for USA cards, if they do maybe 1%. PayPal standard does not charge customers cross boarder fees.
My TD merchant account may charge me an extra up to 1% for USA customers and premium cards. (its an actual terminal in my store)
I Pay 1.6% swipe fee.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:03:17
well ebay sells the item for you and provides the traffic so 10% is standard sales commission, its cheaper if you have an ebay store. Amazon is no cheaper.
ebay is only good if you can get supplies dirt cheap to resell, of if you really need to flog something off, if you can only make 10% markup there is no profit

I Have a credit union (for my business), so it doesn't cost for deposits. So it doesn't matter what form of cash or cheque it is, I do not pay. But with the major banks, it really depends if you use a teller, an atm machine, or a cheque, bills or coins, and you get charged depending on what you deposit. (which is retarded)

I neat thing about Canadian Credit Unions, when you have a business bank, you can entroll for Online Bill Payments for free with Central1. this is cool, that means any customer that uses a credit union can pay me using online banking (bill payments) and it wont cost me. But If I want the same service with a bank, I have to pay $25-35 per bank per month to be listed on their online banking for the customers to use. (very expensive when you add up how many banks there is)

All my ASICMiner blades, cubes paid for themselves minus electricity.
But this is the fault of me buying the devices when bitcoin was over $1000, and they were priced a tad higher then they should be. But As soon as bitcoin goes back up past $800, i made profit.
And actually the 13G blades can underclock 1.05V, and use 80 watts power. So you could still run them, they just would only pay for the electreicity.

I remember buggin TD merchant services a couple of times over the year, and telling them how I like to keep up to date with new technologies such as bitcoin, and when top companies start implementing the technology its worth while to look into.
I was having a conversation with them as their merchant services solution lacks the ability to integrate with software and other hardware, and the software solution they have is only a virtual terminal, unless you use a 3rd party gateway (bean stream) with is very expensive $100+/month. The guy knew I was an API programmer and provided eCommerce software that worked with PayPal and bean stream, and I had an open ticket concerning a bug I found, and many suggestions. I know my call got passed up to higher levels.
I think that Paypay decided to itegrate bitcoin really got their attention.

People in the BTC world are like bitches, and complain way too much, yet they are nieve and keep on getting suckered.

This is a prime example why open source is bad... either somone will steel your idea and fork it, or some big company (ex: google) will profit from it making everyone work for free.
Now if you don't care about paying the bills and lving life, and your mom pays all the bills or you get a free ride in life, then open source is good ! But in reality, R&amp;D costs money and it takes time to recoup invertments and profit is needed.

I lost my job with the pharmacy becuase of opensource. Some company that has open souce software, was able to pick up the contract because they offered the software free but at a support cost, while the software i was supporting (not my software, but it was what they were runnuing prior to me) the programmer retired and wanted $20000 for it for us to own the software, and i was going to get trained to take over the project by the pharmacy. Esentially the pharmacy software company profits off work of others, while steeling jobs. So I ended up having to close up my store, and laying off a few employees. Its hard to compete with free software !

Paypal charges me 2.9% + 0.30 per transaction. I have seen it go down to 2.2% when my volume is up the month before. (to receive money)
If I pay someone, I do not fund my transactions by visa if its a personel transfer, but I do use visa if its to a business. (on personel transfers funded by visa, the person sending the money pays the visa fee, but when sending money to a business, they pay the transaction fee for the sale as well as you get escrow services out of it)
I do have a company in india that charges me 3.9% + .30 for using paypal. (2.9% + 1% cross boarder fee). Any funds I send them, they deduct the fee from the total received.
