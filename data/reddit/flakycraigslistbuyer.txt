Now you're a lawyer, "advising" them.  You're not suing. You're not advising. You're taking it up the ass like everyone else, and you're probably going to try to gamble it back in some way, digging yourself into a deeper hole.

Is there really? I have redeemed several and only seen the text version. Perhaps I was not looking in the right place or have an older version. This is a series 2 1BTC coin from 2013.
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:34:33
I remember that too. To be fair though, they stopped doing that once they were publicly outed. Now the only issues I have with them are the intrusive KYC questions and constant identity verification which is to be expected for a company that is 100% legit and law-abiding. They are the most secure, reliable, and only insured brokerage/exchange I will do business with.
@_date: 2016-04-03 18:02:11
Any at this point. I know mycelium says it can. I tried, but it requires a qr code to scan. This is a casascius coin I am redeeming so there is no qr to scan. I am also afraid to use a qr generator program for obvious trust reasons. I just want to type it in and import it, if possible.

Yes, I know what a trustee is.  Thanks.
It is a weak threat.  If the translation is correct, "plan to consider taking necessary legal action" not only means that legal action is not inevitable.  It also means not only has he/she not even considered it, but he **plans** to consider it.  Choice of words matter in these things, and they reveal a lot about how serious a plaintiff is about his case, even if you don't recognize it as a layperson.  
A much better way of framing it, even if he wasn't serious about legal action, would be to eliminate words that imply uncertainty (namely, "plan" and "consider.")  "We reserve the right to pursue legal action" would be a million times better than what was written/translated.
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:10:51
I am not "talking" to anyone.  Do you have to, to comment on a news story?  If it's a bad translation, okay.  If not, I am sick of people making empty legal threats.  Happens all the time with people pissed off at ASIC manufacturers.  "I plan to give serious thought to possibly contacting a lawyer to contemplate filing a legal complaint" is about how far most of them go.  This is probably no different.
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:11:16

Tricky in what way? If it's carrying inventory you are worried about, that's nonexistent with merch. Basically I just upload the design and amazon fulfills it from their existing inventory. There is zero investment beyond the design itself.
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:36:51
I guess amazon ramped up the costs a bit since I last designed a shirt. At $15, we will be at a $3.44 profit margin, so we'll split $1.72 each. I get paid monthly, and when I do, I'll just tip the address in the QR you posted on github. Obviously I don't expect to make much off this though but it'd be funny to see how many people actually buy them if it keeps going up in price. I will post the link to buy the shirt once it goes live... probably just in this thread since other people are probably making the same shirt and I don't want to spam.

If Bitcoin goes to the moon, I and my children, and their children's children are set for life with the coins I hodled.

I see governments and "the establishment" banks trying to tarnish it only insofar as it benefits them to do so. Once Bitcoin reaches a tipping point to where the exchanges are secure enough, the software is not dealing with shit like blocksize limit debates, and it is not considered experimental (think 1.0), the tides will turn.  At that point, it will likely be robust enough for banks and the stock market to use the blockchain as a ledger beyond simple money transactions. It can be used for voting systems, smart contracts, etc. Once those varied uses are perfected, I firmly believe there will be an arms race of sorts. The first country to "adopt it" as a currency could have a huge advantage in terms of reversing national debt. The first bank to adopt it will as well, and once those dominos start to fall, the road is already paved for the rest of the establishment to fall in line.  It sounds far-fetched until you look at things like the recent statements by the White House on blockchain technology, and the NASDAQ usage that is occurring already.  I am not a math person so I cannot assign dollar figures to these corresponding events, but I do believe the future for Bitcoin and its investors is quite bright.

I have been heavily invested through at least three bubbles now. I bought my first coin in 2012. This definitely is a slower, steadier growth which can be seen in the charts. I am not convinced adoption is progressing right along with it, nor is the technology ready for the adoption that is possible. I think there will still be profit-taking and a correction, probably taking us sub-900 at some point, but nowhere near the lows we have seen in the last 2 years. 
I have sold the majority of the coins I started with. Enough that I don't care how low the price goes, but I still possess enough to get super excited when we see rises like this.

I feel your pain. I lost quite a bit to gambling bitcoin in 2012. Luckily, I bought a bunch of physical bitcoin in the form of Casascius coins. Those are too pretty to redeem and have allowed me to HODL all this time. I recommend making those 0.25 as inaccessible as possible if you have the gambling bug. Physical coins or really nice cold storage that you make on your own is one way to do that.

You would be surprised how little the markup is on them in relation to the counterparty risk when you go to sell it. In person or via escrow, I have never been comfortable selling mine and have always peeled them, and then sold the redeemed coins later. My peace of mind is worth more than the risk of having them confiscated at an airport terminal, payment stolen by an escrow guy gone rogue, or getting mugged at a meetup.

Why did they fight naked and only have body armor to cover their heads, and a shield to cover their forearms? Cocks out completely vulnerable.

You underestimate the advantages of being first. This is not myspace and facebook. People have real financial incentives to making sure Bitcoin succeeds. Businesses based on it and self-directed retirement portfolios with it as the foundation. 
We will not just simply cash out of Bitcoin into a speculative alt. Cash out of fiat, sure. But it will be diversification and an influx of fiat into all of crypto. Not one form of crypto dying out in favor of another. We saw that with ETC and we are seeing it again with BCH. Don't hold your breath.

No, it would just instill confidence in whichever coin is worth more. Some will lose money, some will make money. HODLERS will always win no matter what happens.

Why would anyone "cash out" and sell everything? There are many people who have predicted Bitcoin could go up to $1,000,000 or more in the long term. You'd be a fool to sell it ALL, at any amount whether it's $.10, $1.00, or $1,000,000.  
My strategy in the beginning when it was like $15.00 a coin was to sell 20 to 50% at each perceived bubble, depending on how much money I needed in my life. Some peaks I never sold any at all, but to go full retard and sell everything makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:01:19
Unlikely to crash??? Are you new? There is always a crash, and it is usually followed up by another surge higher than before. But that surge can take weeks or years. Nobody knows, so people who do this kind of thing, not immediately selling to cover the fiat spend, are gambling that history is not going to repeat itself. Pretty stupid... unless he has the fiat reserves to cover it all. I know this guy does, but there are others that could read your language and think they are safe in the short term when it is likely the opposite.

These guys are a couple of douchebags that contribute nothing beyond inflating their own egos, and it's unfortunate that they didn't even allow her to expand on the areas of her expertise (which, admittedly were not anywhere near ACH, SWIFT, or the technology behind blockchain.)  That's a shame, but I do think she is handling it poorly after the fact as well.

Wrong. Learn  the difference between possession vs. ownership. When FedEx possesses your package, they do not own it. Bitcoin is revolutionary and all that, but it does not change basic property law in this respect. And it is important to note this distinction because ownership triggers a whole new statutory framework, particularly when   crimes like theft occur.

It is dangerous to bet on one chain versus the other. You do not want to hear the advice to hold, but that is consistently the best option if you want to increase value over time.  
If you bought Bitcoin in May, you already own both BTC and BCH. So don't do anything stupid by decreasing your holdings of one versus the other. If either one goes up, you win. But only if you hold.

We tried this last time and it didn't stick.

Wrong. Learn the difference between possession and ownership, people. So tired of seeing this lie repeated in here. You can still own something without possessing the item itself, or even the keys to it.  Bitcoin is awesome and groundbreaking. It is a disruptor for sure, but don't kid yourself into thinking it is so innovative that existing property law framework doesn't address issues that arise when it is stolen, found, mislaid, in possession of etc. The law is quite clear and capable of handling these situations, even with Bitcoin.

I have managed to hold for years. The only way was by buying Casascius coins. It would kill me to peel one and redeem it.  I recommend doing the same from someone on bitcointalk, or finding an equally nice way to store your coins.  
When they are digital, they are too accessible and it's like not even money. It becomes far too easy and tempting to try to time markets or buy shit you don't need.  Beautiful cold storage is the way to go. Sorry about your loss.

Are you new to this community within the past 3 years or so? Because in 2012, micropayments were all the rage.  People were all excited about being able to tip each other, thinking of silly use cases like sending a small amount of bitcoin to a driver in a car in front of you if they let you merge onto the highway.  Getting past paywall news articles, etc.  
Now all of a sudden, because the devs and miners can't get their shit together, people pretend like that was never one of Bitcoin's goals.  Just another goal forgotten about.  Fallen by the wayside, only to be picked up by a different coin that will probably, someday, overtake Bitcoin.

Well that's not very smart. You really should set up some sort of retirement plan, or at least a savings account for a rainy day.

You're joking right? Because foresight is not a thing, right? Because spending countless hours and days researching cryptocurrency back when 99.999% of the population had never even heard of it, fascinated by its potential, and eager to buy as much of it as possible... using moneygram and red phones at CVS to buy hundreds at a time, never happened. And after it didn't happen, I didn't hold onto all (ok, most) my coins in the face of ridicule from my friends and family after every boom and bust, upward trending cycle over the last 4 and a half years. 
I am not bitter. I am enjoying this, because every time some dumbass tells me hindsight is 20/20, I look at all the bitcoin I have, the business I started with it, the house I bought with it, the money my kids will have for their college funds, and I think to myself, "Thank goodness for my hindsight." Fuck off :)

I think the fact that people are even having this conversation means it is not overhyped. I remember in the 1990s when I was made fun of for buying a Sony  mp3 player by my friends who all had Sony Discman cd players. I remember paying for a text-based version of the internet before GUI was even a thing.  
There are uses for smart contracts that haven't even been invented yet. And alt coins that have not even been forked from alt coins which have yet to exist that address those uses.  Look at iota, a coin meant for machine-to-machine payment in the internet of things. It is very sci-fi-sounding right now, but so were things like self-driving cars and robotic vacuums and lawnmowers 10 years ago.  
Some of this stuff blows my mind and to dismiss it as overhyped before people can even grasp the future use cases is a shame.  example:  
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:39:02
This asset is in a perpetual, upward trending, bubble/pop cycle. It is also growing too fast for its fundamentals to keep up. This is not necessarily a bad thing if you can hold for the long-term without checking the charts every hour of every day. 
Over time, the technology will catch up to the price IMO, unless of course another crypto displaces it which is entirely possible if the community remains in gridlock.

No. Having the private keys = possession. Ownership can occur with or without regard to possession. This is a common mistake made in this community, but the law well settled. Just because someone else possesses your private key does not mean you do not own the coins, anymore than UPS owns the package you sent when they are in the process of delivering it to its destination.

Unfortunately history has shown this to be false.  Most of the top 20 to 30 alts on coinmarketcap have gained value against BTC over time. Attribute that to whatever reason you like. The better strategy is to have a diversified portfolio of different cryptocurrencies. Obviously not the scams, but just buy and hold, say, the top ten by marketcap on coinmarketcap.com and you likely will do just fine.

Much longer than 2 weeks.  The time for difficulty to readjust would be extended. It is only 2 weeks assuming a somewhat constant hash rate. As someone else pointed out, if hash rate drops by 10, you can expect it to take 10 times longer to find a block. So, 20 weeks for difficulty to readjust instead of 2.

Wrong. They are still his coins. They've just been stolen. Just like if someone were to hack into your bank account and ACH all the money into their own checking account. It does not matter that the private keys were in someone else's possession, just the same as it does not matter that UPS or FedEx possesses your package while en route to your house after you have already paid for it. Once you own something, your rights are not diminished if someone else possesses it, even if it is stolen.  
I wish this misunderstanding of property law would stop being spread on this reddit. Do your part and correct it whenever you see it being spread, because it makes people reluctant to make efforts to get their coins back when they are stolen. "Duh, I guess I didn't own them since I didn't have the private key. Oh well, someone else owns them now. I hope they are good owners and take good care of my coins..."

It is more like the sinking titanic and Ethereum is a Regal Cruiseliner passing it by, trying to throw it life preservers while you guys sit around hobnobbing, moving the deck chairs around, and telling the waiters around you that you have enough water, nevermind that  it's saltwater leaking in through the portholes and ceiling around you.

Altcoins like what, for example? Also, at what point does Bitcoin become an alt coin? Would it be once another coin surpasses its market cap, which could happen in the next couple months if trends continue? Something to ponder as you also ponder what your position is and whether you might be overinvested in one coin, both financially and emotionally.

Kamikazi is used colloquially to mean sabotage. It has nothing to do anymore with the nationality of the person it refers to.  Nice try though.

Get out of here with this bullshit. You would be just as outraged and looking for solutions if it was you too.

Hah! That's nothing. I once lost 100BTC in a satoshidice bet with like 95% odds.

There was a bubble? And it popped? You're adorable...

Stop with the stupid mind games. They didn't work in 2013. They won't work now. Focus on fundamentals and not taking 1 hour to pay someone. The system is broken and we need a fix, not mind games.

Do you really not see why that is not the best answer to his question?  The answer "because USD cannot flow in or out easily" is more helpful because it goes to the root of the problem. Merely stating there is more demand does not address the "why" as precisely.

There was a bubble? Where?

Sounds like it might be a good time to look into Monero.
