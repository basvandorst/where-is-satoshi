You don't have to just explain it to them in theory, GIVE THEM COINS. Give them a dollar of something. If you people are as cryptorich as you put on you should be giving them $20. Give them coins they can play with right away. Then when they have a conversation about cryptocurrency with someone else who brings up how Bitcoin is in the news, they'll say, "oh yeah, I've got some of that cryptocurrency stuff, Bob gave me some, it's here on my phone." A demonstration is worth a thousand explanations. If you're telling someone they should pay fiat for crypto then they're going to be suspicious but if you're telling them you're giving them $5 of crypto they're going to be grateful and curious.

They mostly charge a percentage on each trade.  So whatever coin people are trading they're scraping some.  I'd think it'd be worth it for them to carry a coin as long as there's enough volume to cover the expense and hassle of running a daemon for the coin.  Often when an exchange removes a coin it's because it works so badly (forks, etc.) that running a client on it becomes too annoying to bother with.  If a coin works OK at all there's not much cost to throwing it in.  Usually at least a smaller exchange will take a coin, since they're trying to find niches to distinguish from the big exchanges.  But I don't know what it'll be like with this new super big wave of shit coins coming, maybe we'll develop yet another tier of even shittier sloppier exchanges for things to start in. :/

This person is asking for basic information about cryptos, so I'm giving them not just information-- a whole paragraph of OC, which admittedly isn't worth much, but probably at least a few satoshi I'd say-- and also some actual crypto to actually use immediately.  That's not an insult, it's a gift.  It doesn't have to be a "tip" that aligns with some old fasioned RL idea of "tipping"-- we're not here some forum post equivalent of cabbies or strippers-- it's simply a microtransaction.

@_date: 2014-01-17 15:24:18
I guess that's worth about two cents today.  But it's really more denominated in doge.  People tip relative to how other people are tipping, not relative to the USD or BTC value.  It's more related to how much you've been able to mine lately on a typical gaming computer, I'd say.  From that we derive the notion that having approximately hundreds of thousands of coins makes you a "middle class shibe."  From that scale it follows that tips in the tens are ordinary, tips in the hundreds are already quite good, tips in the thousands are getting somewhat painful and thus an extraordinary gesture, and tips in the tens of thousands are quite rare and a special event. 
If you have into the millions you are a "rich shibe," which means that to be "rich" costs just a few hundred dollars.  This is a particular social role with particular duties to the community.  For instance if someone's known to have millions of coins it would be quite reasonable to interrogate them as to whether they've donated to Save Dogemas yet, as that's been informally collectively agreed to be something any rich shibe ought to do.  On the other hand there is no social obligation for rich shibes to scale their tips differently, and indeed it seems to be more polite for them to scale their tips to the immediate social context.  That makes sense because if a middle class shibe had just tipped something tens or hundreds, it would be rude for a rich shibe to casually drop tens of thousands a moment later and render the first tip meaningless. 
Someone with dogecoin wealth up to the low five digits is a "poor shibe" and it's agreed that there's a collective social obligation to find a way to flow enough coin to them to keep them feeling like they're meaningfully participating.  That's not too difficult, precisely because we've made a situation where tips in the tens are appropriate and welcomed and not entirely overshadowed, so that we can give a poor shibe a few tips of fifty or a hundred and that's enough for them to make a bunch of meaningful tips and feel that they've had a voice. 
Tips in the tens of dogecoin aren't really "tips" at all, they're something else.  They're given constantly for the smallest things or for just asking or for literally nothing at all.  They're given along with harsh words to soften them.  They're given along with simple words to brighten them.  To see them as worth "only" pennies is to miss the point that they are worth dogecoins, which worth is why so many of us these days are seeing fit to trade some of our pennies in for dogecoins, which have in this new strange moment different and amazing powers.  +25 doge

Wow so the explosion's finally hit us!  I'm on [a dozen]( forks of your bot now and I'm not even sure that's all of them‽  I just got "yeezbombed" my first coinye. :o 
I like the leading zeros.  I mostly think people are just confused by new things and once you're in the cryptocurrency world for a while you get used to dealing in satoshi and litoshi-- that's how it works.  But if we're going to give them what they want, what they really want is a syntax that lets them tip some satoshi and say it as a big, round number.  "100 satoshi"!  I apologize for my laziness in not looking for myself at whatever regex or w/e does that parsing, but would it be too much trouble to support just the syntax: +100 satoshi ?  That's what I think would best satisfy their whole number fetish. 
I was wrong BTW.  I don't know what I was thinking.  For some reason I thought that Bitcoiners would immediately respond to the challenge of Dogecoin and start tipping satoshi.  But it doesn't seem that's how it's going to go down at all.  It's *Litecoin* that feels threatened by Dogecoin.  The similarity of algorithm-- Litecoin's unsteady place in second-- it's a much more natural rivalry.  (They've been tending towards this new litetip rather than the main alt bot, which makes sense in terms of branding-- they're trying to emphasize Litecoin, not call people's attention to a bunch of other rivals.)  If Litecoin successfully meets the challenge and becomes another tipping powerhouse, it can *then* join forces with Doge (and the rest of the meme coins) to create the challenge that draws Bitcoin to deeply participate as well.

We can't change it unilaterally for everyone, because consensus isn't determined centrally, it's a truly decentralized process.  *You* can change the 51% to 71% *for yourself* by not doing Bitcoin transactions (in formal consensus jargon "standing aside") while there's a chain fork.  We actually do all stand aside whenever there's a substantial fork and attempt to resolve the dispute, because we all want clarity.  But we each get to choose for ourselves what counts as a dispute severe enough that we'll personally stand aside from it.  We could make changes to defaults in various software to condition that decision, but in terms of the rules in the network we can't tell nodes what to do.  The scenario where there's a genuine confusion to resolve and the situation where there's an attacker creating a false confusion that should be ignored can't be distinguished from inside.

Well that's not what people here think, and their investment feeling threatened is the main thing they're complaining about.  But anyway it is obviously bad for an investment in Bitcoin if Dogecoin gains market share; they're directly competing.  Also, increasing use of off-chain transactions like these tip bots is clearly threatening to the value of on-chain transactions and thus to the value of bitcoins.  That's why the complaint is that we shouldn't tip anything under a certain amount (decided by rich white american standards) at all instead of just pushing people towards tipping credits for a small amount of satoshi instead of shiboshi.  People exchanging small amounts of credit here freely suggests that there might not end up being a long-term need for Bitcoin's expensive censorship resistance architecture.

It's odd to discuss this so blandly and theoretically while Bitcoin is *actually being used* this moment in a war (in Ukraine).  Instead of theorizing what it might be like, you could ask them‽  It sounds from what I've heard that it's been lots of finding local buyers for BTC and then giving the cash to the families of people shot in the streets-- sounds like rewarding work I suppose, in a depressing way.  I don't know why you assume the internet would be down during a war, that's rarely the case now and it's going to become less and less possible over the next few years.

First an important piece of advice: Don't capitalize the C.  Please. 
Setting that aside, why do you think this is a business you want to get into, particularly?  The mainstream media about the Bit Coin gives an impression that mining is especially central to what's going on, but that's just because they can only explain so many things at once.  Mining is an important part of the system but it's not the central part of the economy (anymore).  You should participate in whatever way you're best equipped to-- sing if you're a singer, dance if you're a dancer, paint us a painting.  You should be a miner only if you feel like running some computers in a room somewhere securing transactions is a business (or hobby) that you actually want to get involved with for some reason.

The operative words being "to me"-- it doesn't mean anything to *you*.  It *does* mean something to other people.  Indeed, the fair market price on Reddit for many services that take actual time and effort is below the amount of cryptocurrency that sells for one cent (on a legally obstructed set of markets where the demand is clearly suppressed). 
I don't think that's so unreasonable or unexpected if you think about it.  There are many places on Reddit where you can fairly reliably get real valuable help with various problems for the low low price of completely free.  Naturally if you can get plenty of help for zero, you can get even more for half a cent. 
Another way to consider it that makes it clear how very low prices can be reasonable is to take for example the service of amateur photoshopping.  So many people can do basic tasks in a graphics editor that the supply is nearly unlimited and most of the demand already satisfied.  Thus in any reasonably free market for basic graphics editing right now the price would quickly fall to a three or even two digit number of satoshi.  Sad news if you'd like to make any serious money doing basic graphics editing, I guess, but awesome news if you're not good at editing graphics and you need something basic done!!

Dogecoin is a relatively safe space, where there's not only a dominant friendly vibe but also active rejection and protection against various negative intrusions.

Thank you very much! 
We're in a strange situation.  If only all the poor people could somehow post here saying "help, seriously, I can't use cryptocurrency yet because I'm too poor to afford a computer and internet," with plenty of pictures and videos authenticating that they're too poor to afford a camera or broadband, well then lots of people would tip them a little or hire them for odd jobs and they could get started. 
I've felt like sharing is one of the main purposes of Dogecoin.  There's so much of it being issued that there's already enough of them that we could give a few dogecoin to each person on Earth.  I know that's not realistic yet, since there's lots of people it's hard to get them to still, while other people hoard billions, but that's still my ideal. 
What Dogecoin is giving a lot of people who feel like they "missed Bitcoin" is a sense of ownership, that it's their creation and vision and they were there from the start.  So I feel like I want to spread it around quickly to lots of people so lots of people can get that feeling of having been there at the beginning of something really unexpected and new!  WOW! :) +250 doge
I guess that's another response to the OP's question.  People aren't just staking their claim to Dogecoin financially by buying/earning some, they're staking an emotional claim to it by being there first.  They're spending it on X so they can be the first person *ever* to spend dogecoin on X.  And people are still doing that with Bitcoin too.  Not that they need a reason more than that they have some bitcoin and want to buy something, but they're also buying things right now because they're consciously participating in history, they're buying something on the first day Overstock accepted Bitcoin so that they can look back and say that they did, that they participated in this change rather than just watching it.  We're making history together!

I still think Bitcoin or BTC denominated credits will also be used for everyday playful purposes, but first Bitcoiners have to wake up and realize how important that is.  Dogecoin is or should be a huge wake up call to Bitcoin about what's possible.  There's no reason people can't be throwing around BTC credits as easily and playfully as dogecoins.  There's already a bot (that goes down to 5000 satoshi worth of credit I think it is, and we could easily put up ones that go even lower.  There just also needs to be a change in the culture to allow and encourage small tips/gifts/sharing.

That's odd that you list "encyclopedias" as something the internet obviously has. Even long after Wikipedia had beat Britannica cold and it had been broadly studied and carefully verified that it had, the public conversation about it was still that paper encyclopedias must be better somehow, *must* be. 
Do you actually not know that Bitcoin has uses other than money? It's an identification system, for instance. The Bitcoin conversation is going to be exactly the same sort of conversation as we had about the internet. "OK, fine, maybe it's a *little* useful for this thing, but it's still not as good as the old thing, and it's certainly not useful for *that* thing, what are you talking about, noooooo."

Who cares what the price is?  Why would a stable price be good?  Why would that make sense?  It doesn't seem logically possible to me.  I mean look at what you're saying: A stable price would make it a better, more useful system.  So it should become a better, more useful system.. but no one should notice and buy more and make the price rise??  It's not an internally coherent logically possible thing that could happen.  So why wish for that?  Who cares? 
Why not wish that a reasonable balanced *portfolio* of cryptos become stable?  That's closer to the actual possible situation that's developing.  It's more complicated for the end user because they don't get to just own BTC and always reliably get richer.  But that's life, life's complex, investment opportunities where you reliably get richer do not and cannot and should not exist.

Yeah there aren't "dead" colored coins, just forgotten ones, sitting on living blockchains ready to be dusted off any time.  Coins will probably end up colored more than one way, as one color becomes so valueless the best use for them is to repaint them.  Yeah back now should seem so quaint and simple.  But even still, all or most of these blockchains will continue then, most of them flocking around copying one another's patches (as they have with KGW), such that it's really one big interrelated chaotic project.  And endless colored coins too on all the semi-abandoned chains, absolutely worthless for anything-- unless of course you want a nearly free distributed asset ledger!

I'd say the start of the valuation was before that, and even lower.  Before a cryptocurrency is even worth enough to buy an actual thing, it's enough for random gifts and then for small tips.  I wouldn't say the actual first transaction, Satoshi -&gt; Finney, was non-economic.  It was playful because it was worthless, but also in exchange for feedback about how the transaction went, etc.  Each new cryptocurrency goes through those same stages, being used for play transactions and tipping before someone values it enough to part with something solid.  +50 doge

Organizations integrated into the system have started accepting bitcoin donations but only if they can do in it this ritualized pageantry where everyone writes down all the info they would have had to if it had been a credit card transaction.  PITA.  We're going to have to keep making our own countercultural charities to be able to donate anonymously or in small amounts.  +25 doge

Oh well I wouldn't really recommend this tool, by the by.  I haven't actually forked a cryptocurrency yet myself, but I don't believe it's difficult at all.  Like not at all.  The only way the price of this service makes any sense at all is that there's no competition, and hopefully there'll be competition soon, so I hope if you don't want to do it on your own you'll just wait a moment for someone to force the price down.  Or just hire someone on your own, if you put up a [WTB] an on or wherever asking for someone to fork a coin clone for you I bet you'd get a decent offer. :)

There's only one thing that could possibly work: Do something to transform or replace the culture of this coin, which is incredibly sexist and otherwise intolerable.  Reference for this fact: Almost all the other posts on this thread. :( 
That's one way Dogecoin's dramatically changed my perspective on cryptocurrency, is that I've realized that I should just give up on changing this Bitcoin culture.  At some point the people who are getting involved through the Dogecoin perspective will trade in some of their coins for Bitcoin and start living more of their life on this practically useful network and become, technically, Bitcoiners.  But they'll never join this culture.  They don't want to, for good reason, and I realize now they don't have to.

Dogecoins are way useful right now!  They're at least as useful as their surging value suggests.

We spread them out to a bunch of people, so we're ready to all play our chips at once.  Then when the moment feels right we all put a bunch of chips down on something fun, like "Jamaican bobsled team," and we all win together!

The malleability line Gox put out is bullshit, but it was loud effective bullshit (as evidenced by your asking about it), so it's clearly affected the market even though it's bullshit.  Also some other things happened nearly simultaneously, such as Russia taking a harsher tone and things getting hacked/stolen, so maybe those also had some effect but there's not really any way to disentangle them and find out. 
One thing to consider is that there are a lot of traders trying to make money quickly trading on the bitcoin price.  That means those fuckers sell when they think it's going down, even and *especially* if they think it's a temporary nonsensical dip, in order to cash out and buy some cheaper.  The more people playing that game the more any and all irrational movements are intentionally amplified.

That's just old fashioned thinking.  Accepting it as a payment doesn't mean you're holding it as an investment.  You don't even have to hold it for the moments it would take you to resell it-- you resell it *before* accepting it, or buy volatility insurance, or however you want to work/describe it.  Everyone always holds whatever they want for investment purposes, while also being able to instantly transact in whatever's convenient to transact in.  You hold whatever coin you feel is going "to the mooooooooon" and then when it's time to buy something you convert it to whatever its convenient for your merchant to accept-- that is if you haven't been able to convince your merchant to take your favorite coin and join you on your moon trip. ;)

Huh, I have an even wilder idea.  I guess 4chan inspired me with -- that's great, thanks 4chan, just like with Dogecoin that's very revealing.  We haven't let it soak deep into our intuitions yet that *trademarks don't work here* and nobody can stop you from changing what things mean.  What if we just seized the *term* Bitcoin? :o 
To normal people there isn't "cryptocurrency," there's just this thing "Bitcoin" that they're vaguely heard of.  That's the main brand.  For some reason I was thinking that had to mean that this *chain* is what that word means!  Ha!  That's not what "Bitcoin" means to most people, it's identical with the whole idea of cryptocurrency.  Which is fair enough, since almost all of the cryptos are forks of the Bitcoin code.  So we could just refer to them that way and call them "Bitcoins."  The original Bitcoin is just one Bitcoin, the one with all the drama and the weird cult that really thinks it's gold, etc., and the other Bitcoins are more chill. :D

I did.  Dogecoin's uniqueness is that it's evolved a new, positive, constructive culture.  It's not the picture itself or the memes themselves but the culture and the spirit of the culture, the way the spirit of the culture relates to those shared themes and concepts.  It's a subtle interpersonal thing, which is why I suggested hanging out as the best way to discover what it's about.  You just don't get it and/or are trolling.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:37:12
You don't even have to ask people like Bill Maher if they like Bitcoin, you can just look at the price.  Bitcoin would not be selling for this little if that culture with so much media pull and so much money from pulling the media around cared about it at all. 
It's funny because it looks from one angle like it would be an easy lift.  People like Bill Maher should think it's cool and adopt it, which would cause an immediate mainstream wave afterwards.  What's missing from that story is the *consequences*, the consequences are heavy, it's hard to lift those heavy consequences.  Consequences do go back through time and affect the things that lead to them *because people think about consequences* and change the present in order to change the future.  So even though the path there should be easy, when you start to walk it *someone notices* and they do what they have to to prevent the transformation. 
For instance it's cheap to buy some disinfo trolling on the sub.  For instance it's easy to tell the media through the usual command channels that they should spread FUD for now.  Hell, Maher's on the gravy train, I don't know why you're taking him so seriously, those are talking points, those are lines. 
The piercing doesn't happen where you'd expect, because that's also where *they* can expect it.  They defend right there.  The media is a vulnerable point, so they hold really firm on anything that can control anything that can control the media.  But there's a whole rest of the world they can't cover.  Dogecoin, for instance-- chill out, it's a Bitcoin clone, it's this same software, the same phenomenon-- was a moment when Bitcoin pierced a certain level of awareness, unexpectedly and thus uncontrollably.

BItcoiners were told not to tip, so they didn't, and they became isolated and angry.  Dogecoiners were told not to tip, but they did anyway, in more places, more creatively, more excitingly, until many thousands of people were involved and it was accomplishing beautiful things in the world.  People always tell you no when you do something new, whether or not it's a good idea, because people are scared of new things.

I find quite seriously that it's easier to get the average person into Dogecoin.  Part of what makes Bitcoin difficult is the very serious vibe around it, there's this feeling that everything is hyper intense and you could fuck everything up any moment and there's vast clouds of FUD.  Dogecoin feels more like just a simple meme to participate in, as easy as being a brony or Anonymous.  The number of people being introduced to cryptocurrency for the first time through Dogecoin now is huge; it's not really so much about Dogecoin itself as about how inaccessible Bitcoin is, not technically but socially and emotionally. +50 doge

It's not a fault that you're allowed to use the bare metal system, it's a feature. You can do all kinds of dangerous interesting things, like writing programs that automatically send bitcoin. Obviously the bare metal system isn't safe enough for everyone to use all the time, but the solution to that isn't to chain up everything and not let anything happen so everyone's safe. It's not a bug in chainsaws that they're dangerous; you use them to cut stuff.

It's difficult to really swallow it, it's a bitter pill.  You hear stuff about the media being controlled, biased, limited, whatever, and without looking into the details you make for yourself a nice story about that, you picture it as an innocent mistake, as something that lets you sleep at night.  It takes a while not to understand the concept but to accept in your gut the nauseous reality of *talking points*, actual memos going out to the media outlets with what they should say, or of journalists being brought into rooms and quietly being told that "people in Washington" have ordered a change in their reporting (orders that come in the form of the politest of indirect statements, but orders nonetheless), of outright bribery with the payment of cash money, or with expensive luxury goods as if that were different, of a group of people calling themselves the political journalists who go to fancy parties with the people they report on and socialize with them and then report what they want them to say, after outright asking them what they want them to say, after being in bed with them in the sense of having literal sex with them, or the actual prostitutes they actually corruptly hire (including underage ones) to reward those who work with them, or then there's actual death threats and rejection and terror and actual death or prison, often, to those who do resist and speak the truth.

Well here's the thing.  There's a lot of sober rational economic theories that would suggest that you're right that people shouldn't care about tips below a certain value.  There's also a lot of practical evidence that they do care about them and like them and work hard to get them.  Literally the [very next thing in my inbox]( under your response was someone's who's as you can see clearly genuinely happy and thankful and indeed went out of their way to expend effort on producing (very simple) unique content on demand, all for 150 TIPS (fedoracoins, that is)-- which now trades for approximately $0.00085 (total, for all 150 of them). 
I'm wary myself of anecdotal evidence which is why as you can see that entire reddit is devoted to exploring the economics of *exactly* how hard people will work for *exactly* how little cryptocurrency.  There's no deception intended about how small the tips are.  Maybe that's the next tasks I'll put up, asking people to make things to clarify just how small the tips are to make it even clearer. :D  I want to try to make this clear because I do think it's counter-intuitive *which means that it's tremendously interesting* if it can also be clearly demonstrated by evidence. 
I very much appreciate your tip.  I'll attempt to appreciate it in proportion to its economic value relative to other smaller tips I've gotten recently in other coins. ;)  But think about the economics of what I have to do to get more tips of that size from Bitcoiners on It's random, so it can't condition my behavior.  It's clearer how to get a bunch of Dogecoin tips-- go hang out on and comply with the culture there and you get a steady stream of them.  It's even more clear how to get a tiny number of fedoracoin (do one of those silly tasks).  So it's easy for to condition people to do things, it's fairly easy for Doge tipping to drag in people who are willing to play along in exchange for tips, but it's hard for larger BTC tips to condition behavior because they can't be predicted.  That's my theory anyway.  We must form theories that fit this data.

Um yes technically, but that release didn't count because it wasn't fair.  Let that be a lesson to Ethereum &amp; etc., if they think they can't be footnoted!  Anyway regardless of who deserves most credit for the advance, it was indeed advanced then, and Litecoin has a well-earned place as the first (fairly released and successful) coin with any different algorithm.  Calling it "cloney," in reference to Bitcoin, compared with Dogecoin, seems to me to misstate this history.  Dogecoin is a successful new coin when there's so many new coins that most fail, so that's impressive, but Litecoin was a successful new coin when there had *never before been* a successful alt coin, and that was groundbreaking.

There's a third thing that's important about Fee free tips.  Well, it *is* code, but the code already exists to do the same tips with BTC, it just hasn't been *used* because of a cultural difference.  The problem with changing that bit of culture to make Bitcoin work as well as Doge is that that difference isn't accepted here as positive!  There's a bunch of unlearning that has to be done of this intuition (really just a rationalization of the limitations of the bitcointip bot, IMO) that small tips are unacceptable and "rude."  +0.00002468 BTC

Which wallet do you mean?  Every wallet that can send bitcoin is a program, but there are wallets that run on your computer (like the Bitcoin-QT reference client), wallets that run on someone else's computer (like Coinbase or the Bitcoin tip bot), or wallets that you download and run in a browser (like blockchain.info). 


Bitcoins are mostly mined with specialized hardware now (ASICs-- application specific integrated circuits).  If it would be cost-effective to mine anything on your home computer, it would probably be one of the Scrypt coins, like Litecoin or its forks including Dogecoin, because there aren't ASICs available yet for that algorithm. 


There's lots of different ways!  Just offer anything valuable.  There's lots of places here with job offers, like but there's a lot of competition for jobs that don't require any particular skills or qualifications. 


Dogecoin is a fork of the Bitcoin code, or more specifically it's a fork of Luckycoin which is a fork of Litecoin which is a fork of Bitcoin.

The problem with the Bitcoin tip bot is that it does its transactions on the chain, which entails fees which in the context of casual forum economics are entirely overwhelming.  You can't tip amounts which are small enough to tip frequently or casually, and even more painfully you can't tip the same piles of coins cyclically within the forum economy-- a pile of coins tipped back and forth quickly erodes to nothing.  That's one of the main reasons people have taken up tipping dogecoins, but it has nothing to do with Dogecoin really it has to do with those fees, and there ought to be much more support for bots like that allow microtipping. +100 doge

Bitcoin is not a boat you have to jump onto, that is not a fair analogy.  It's a protocol.  You can run a piece of software that speaks the protocol and *nothing bad happens* because it's just a program.  It's only when you start to voluntarily revolve your life around it that it can do anything to harm you. 
You can just float a little bit of bitcoin in a bathtub, to continue the analogy, you don't have to tie together a whole raft of it and get aboard.

What I wonder about this is whether a millibit is your idea of a reasonable tip?  Because there aren't really that many millibits to go around, so there isn't really much "flow" to reddits that require tips to be that high.  How do you feel about smaller amounts, like dogecoins or tiny amounts of BTC credit (like the bot will go down to 5000 satoshi)?  I find that's more than enough to motivate people to do real work, as it's very true what you say-- 


--indeed that's so true that it's easily possible to hire people for real jobs for thousands of satoshi, yet some parts of reddit are being very discouraging about those sorts of offers, usually on the fallacious grounds that they're insultingly low (sorry but really they're what the market will bear).

Why the fuck is this reddit all about investing?  Do you even care about the technology Bitcoin?  If you don't know or care about the technology then you shouldn't invest in it because you wouldn't *deserve* to get rich from it.  You shouldn't invest in things you don't understand, that's just gambling.  If you happened to ignorantly buy Bitcoin you'd randomly make money, sure, but if you just wandered around getting suckered into buying premine alts you'd probably randomly lose money, and from your perspective the risks and benefits would seem pretty much the same since you don't know what you're doing.

You don't have to *do* anything to accept tips.  Is that really the problem you have in life?  Being bothered by too much free money in the wrong amounts?  Thank god (or thank Dogecoin) this elitist nonsensical attitude is finally fading.  Look again at the topic we're discussing here-- daycare.  Cryptocurrencies are used for real things now, like buying care and food for children.  If you don't let people tip freely so everyone can get coins you will be *starving children* OK?

You can't sell something for a particular fixed value in BTC because the market doesn't agree at all on what a fair price for BTC is.  It might be useful psychologically if BTC were a more stable unit of account, but it doesn't really matter rationally since we have computers and structures to compensate for the fluctuations and complexities.  Why would an internet currency that's already mostly used by robots move only in ways that are comprehensible to conservative human societies‽  Best just to take it for what it is, follow it down its zigs and its zags. +50 doge

That's my favorite meme!!  I'd be so sad if someone started an AllYourBaseCoin and it was just a crappy premine. :(  Maybe I should make one just to make sure it's a good coin. ;)  Meme coins are a thing, now, but Doge isn't really one of them, oddly enough.  Doge is just a phenomenon onto itself; Doge is the community coin!  It started as a meme coin before there were meme coins, so it got big because it didn't have competition in that niche, but of course that's not what happens to a meme coin as a rule.  Now Dogecoin has its whole own meme complex, it's starting its own subsidiary memes all the time.  It's this other level of internet meme, the memetic collective identity or memetic community.  Compare for instance with bronies or Anonymous.

Well you could google up a better explanation than I can give you.  I read about it and I think I maybe probably understand it but maybe I don't. :)  From my understanding the problem is that there's these transaction ids which are from the exact arrangement of the transaction, but then you don't have to have the private keys to make another different similar transaction, you can rearrange the same private parts into a different arrangement.  Or something, I'm vague on the details.  But anyway the details have been well known in general to people implementing such things, so it's been understood that you shouldn't rely on just that transaction id that's not foolproof, but gox did anyway because it was a lot easier.  If you don't just assume the transaction stays the same, you have to check not whether exactly the same transaction you sent exists, but whether there's any similar transaction (same time, same amount, same destination).  So Bitcoin isn't broken exactly, it's just crappy beta software you need to be careful to work around the issues in, like always.

Does that answer your question, OP?  People are "afraid of or uninterested in" being roped into a community where it's considered "prudent" to invest in a SHA256 coin that's been around a couple years yet a ridiculously unacceptable "risk" to invest in a recently popular Scrypt coin.

It's not an isolated system, of course, but shares most of these properties with many other open source software systems, particularly those involving shared protocols.  Open source software is a brilliant new system of self-governance, perhaps the only effective system of consensus governance in broad use today. 
I abhor the attitude of many of the people here that this system should be used simply to "make money" through the same sort of evil closed systems (like "corporations") that are dominating other economies.  Bitcoin should interoperate with an ecosystem of open *transparent* economic systems which are engineered to fairly reward labor and to create justice.

I sincerely doubt there is a single person in this conversation who believes that you can make a functional social system of any kind that has absolutely no incentives for participation.  I'm pretty sure no one here is suggesting that we should just wait for roads to happen to occur by random chance.  I just think we could pretty easily come up with a system where there's a more peaceful and coherent motivation for making roads than "because if you make a road someone who has a gun will go around collecting money and give it to you."  That's weird and doesn't make sense and is obviously more likely to result in corruption and terror and violence than in a particularly good system of roads. 
Look, if the roads produced by that system were very efficiently made and unquestionably awesome, then I might have to weigh that against my sense that it's *a priori* an awful ugly way to get it done-- but fortunately for my conscience the roads produced by this corrupt system are [exactly the crumbling, worthless shit you'd expect]( 
Think about how awful a system Bitcoin would be if the only reason you could trust miners was that if a miner cheated we'd all agreed to go hunt them down and shoot them.  That would be really fucking stressful and a tremendous investment of energy, wouldn't it?  Compared to the actual peaceful agreement we have that wouldn't accomplish anything or produce anything extra except corruption and violence, would it?

For me to know you control that address, you have to sign something that *I* make up.  Like you could sign the text of this message, or a random number I just made up.  That would be good proof, because you would have to read this message and then sign it, you couldn't have it ready.  If you just signed something saying "Hey!  This is totally my address!  Yeah it is!" then anyone could take that signature and say, OK so to prove to you that I own this address I'll sign something right now that says "Hey!  This is totally my address!  Yeah it is!"  OK ready?  I'll do it.  OK here it is.  And they send the same thing you sent with that message.  So it can't just be a generic message, you have to sign something that's made up by someone else in the situation, they're like testing you to prove you have that key.  Oh yeah?  You've got that key?  Well prove it, sign this number 87387429873482387462873648726384762374672357676457667567477777 because I just made that shit up so there's no way you have in your back pocket a signature for that in case that's what I randomly ask for! :O 
I've never actually signed anything with Bitcoin yet yay fun experiment! :D  Here, I signed your message "Sorry for my ignorance. Where can I learn what "sign a nonce" means, and how to do it?

But there are some pretty clear and obvious demands for reformist action from the reformists if you'd care to listen for a second.  By far the most common I've heard is *put people in jail*.  We have documentation that particular people fraudulently sold particular other people instruments that they knew to be trash.  That's just plain fraud and it's already against the law and the people in the street have simply been calling for them to be put in jail.  I'll try to explain this to you in small words.  When they put a puppet labelled "Bankster" up on a gallows and hang him, they do not literally mean that they want to hang bankers to death, which is no longer our system of justice.  They are demanding that people who intentionally defrauded them of money be put in jail.

OK well but any new chain is a chicken and egg problem.  Even if you're giving out a bunch of your new coin you're still not giving out any value at first.  That's why some people think BTC is going to $1,000,000 is that it's hard to start new ones. 
But what I think is that as value is established in BTC and LTC and maybe a few others that will be a huge incentive for people to figure out how to start new chains even though there's a challenge to it.  Maybe it'd take some capital, some sort of organized campaign.  Just because Terracoin's unlikely to succeed just by changing a couple of lines of code and not actually like even trying very hard doesn't mean that you couldn't start a new coin *somehow*. 
One possibility I've considered is starting new coins in secret, letting in new miners only by invitation.  Obviously this would be a very tricky operation.  But if BTC were worth $1,000,000 then that would mean that the demand for cryptocurrency was so outstripping supply that it would be worth considering how to do the trick.

Just making someone compute something doesn't secure anything.  I don't think you understand what the blockchain secures.  It secures an ordering, a timing.  A bunch of unordered transactions with proof of work on each one doesn't prove anything about *which transaction came first and which is a doublespend*. 
I think you're wrong too about Bitcoin having an inherently inflating resource usage.  The number of hashes is inflating for two reasons: Moore's Law and the fact that Bitcoin is being considered more and more valuable.  People are just investing as much hashing power as they profitably can.  If the market for a cryptocurrency shrinks, the value of the hashing power it can buy also shrinks, it doesn't (it can't) just inflate forever reasonlessly.

The whole idea of brainwallets is to take out the other factor!!  Usually that's what you have is two-factor authentication, because the wallet is on your computer (something you have) but encrypted by a passphrase (something you know).  So if you add a physical factor back to a brainwallet, you just get.. a regular wallet. 
A different idea than brainwallets is to have the second factor other than your passphrase be a physical object that's not a computer.  For instance I've heard of rings with a private key printed on the inside, but missing one digit that you have to memorize.  Or you could have a phrase on an object which is added to a phrase in your brain to make a more secure passphrase. 
Using algorithms like Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, you can store keys so that they can be recovered if you have M-of-N of the factors.  That allows for more complicated systems.  But not necessarily more secure.  Security is a whole-system question, it fails on the weakest link, which isn't usually the cleverly secure thing you thought a lot about, it's some crack somewhere at the edges.

The terminology has to adapt over time, I guess.  Right now for buying ordinary objects on the street the most relevant term is "bitcents," possibly "millibit" for cheap things.  We already don't talk much about whole bitcoin as much, except in terms of storing value or if you're buying something expensive, and you don't really talk about satoshi unless you're talking technical details.  But if people here are right about the future valuation then that'll have to change.  I wonder if the name "bitcent" will start to sound odd if that gets to be a lot of value. :)

What sort of information are you looking for here?  I told you what I think's valuable about bitcoins.  Bitcoin is an actual technology that actually does things.  You can value it or not yourself but it does have value to many people who use it to actually accomplish things. 
*Of course* currencies with central banks intentionally keeping them stable by dramatically manipulating actual economic events are more stable than a brand new distributed currency running on beta software valued by a relatively free market grasping randomly trying to guess its potential future utility.  What a bizarre strawperson of an argument-- "the experimental currency y'all invented yesterday isn't *more stable already* than gold or established currencies!"  Um, thanks for the heads up, Sherlock. 
Anyway I guess I'll pretend you're listening at all and explain what I meant.  *Try* to DDoS the VPN providers that sell connections for Bitcoin by making more connections than they can handle.  You can't *afford* to, see?  There are proxies that are free to use and you can deny people service on those fairly cheaply, but you *can't* deny service to people who pay Bitcoin for a VPN, because they have a reliable way to put a genuine cost on providing that service.  Bitcoin enables the existence of the entire market of anonymous VPN; there would otherwise be no such thing.

Yes, I think you're right.  Intuitively it feels to me like you should be right.  If there's excess mining power available where people could flip a switch and turn on gigahashes for a few watts, and it's *not* profitable to mine on *any* chain with those hashes, then that is an *available untapped resource*.  That means there's people ready and willing to turn those puppies on and give you a strong stream of low hashes of your data, a valuable natural mathematical resource, for the barest bare price of the cheapest electricity anywhere on the most efficient hardware invented.  That shouldn't sit on the virtual shelf.  There *must* be a price above the cost of electricity (the *world's cheapest* cost of electricity) where that product will sell. 
We've already seen social as well as technical innovations, such as [paying off-chain bounties for blocks]( or the much disparaged classic of getting miners to mine a chain based on projections and predictions of its future value rather than its hard sale price. ;)  And merged mining and massively merged mining could be just the beginning of finding a zillion ways to weave every project we possibly can into this magical mesh of unbeatable hashes. 
But there'll be magic from every kind of computer, I think, not just SHA256 hashing ASICs, they're just especially magical for a moment today.  Even every little old laptop might find for a while find itself a powerful profitable node in the mesh, placed just right to catch the most valuable vibrations.  What I expect actually is that devices of all sorts will begin to be priced in terms of *expected overall profit* rather than expected overall cost, that there will cease to be much of any market for any computers that operate at a loss.

This model seems more rational to me: People donate to try to collectively pay a bounty to release a piece.  If the donations don't equal the bounty by a certain date, they're refunded and the data remains secret.  If they do reach the bounty, a torrent is posted publicly as well as sent to all contributors.

I don't think it's as simple as Tor being cracked or uncracked.  There are probably not any exploits of Tor that just show you everything going on in the system.  There are certainly exploits that tell you at least some little scraps more than the exploits that are currently publicly known.  Even the known vulnerabilities are significant-- exit nodes are particularly untrustworthy.  But imperfect systems are still useful.  The Tor network is used and abused and exploited by everyone, just like Bitcoin, and just like Bitcoin at the moment it's just broad enough to withstand those forces and preserve magic fragile internal properties.  My nodes on both networks are faithfully running recent public code. :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:44:13
The difference is mostly that it uses a different hashing algorithm.  It's a minor difference in terms of code but since the hashing is the main activity of the network it does substantially change its properties.  For instance the ASICs which have been designed to mine Bitcoin use the hashing algorithm used in Bitcoin so they're useless for mining Litecoin; Litecoin mining will continue to be most profitable on GPUs (unless/until someone creates a Litecoin mining ASIC, which would apparently be more complex/expensive because it would need onboard memory). 
Litecoin will probably not have a moment of public recognition very soon because it's a complication that doesn't fit the narrative the media wants to write about Bitcoin.  In my opinion it's probably (but of course not certainly) a good investment over the next year or two, but could do anything in the short term.

Would it help if I'm more specific?  Operating an exchange "without first securing a license to do so from the Secretary" (also known earlier in this thread as "some special permission") is forbidden by the [Currency Exchange Act](  If any of the people on the exchange were people they would prefer not to be able to exchange things, they would also consider it a violation of [18 USC § 1956]( which prohibits the "Laundering of monetary instruments" and carries a sentence of a half million dollar fine and *twenty years in jail*.  To enforce this statute they are authorized to break into your house using any of an escalating sequence of intrusion techniques such as the [BR 50 - "Super Ram-It" Battering Ram]( and if you resist or *seem* to resist being held for twenty years for exchanging monetary instruments they may *legally kill you*.

I don't think it's irrational, I think it's just brazenly selfish (as many actions are in this community).  Colored coin would allow people to use the existing mining network to bootstrap new cryptocurrencies, which could be propagandized separately from bitcoin itself, creating value in the cryptocurrency space which doesn't automatically flow directly to them as early adopters and holders of BTC.  Obviously they'd prefer (for themselves) if there were ever only one flavor of cryptocurrency, because that would be most likely to support their fantasy valuation of $1000s for BTC.  But just as obviously, creating many more opportunities for people to become early adopters of something new or to create stable boring currencies or otherwise to add complexity to the system will be beneficial for the system's overall utility.

A community doesn't (of course? you weren't *really* arguing this were you?) need to have their own personal private construction equipment in order to build things.  Or um to say it a different way, if one community went to the expense of making such expensive devices, do you think there's any way they might be persuaded to share with the communities around them??  There are some schools of Anarchism which believe that economic support between communities should always take the form of unquantified solidarity rather than market rate exchanges, but there are *very* few Anarchists who don't think communities should support one another at all, and they, presumably, would not see any need for roads.

This matches the general shape of my intuition as well, but I would add a couple of details.  First, cryptocurrencies are certain to be just one class within a constantly evolving diversity of fungible electronic assets.  At the moment most of the things you can own on the internet are mildly silly, like Second Life property or [unusual hats]( but this cast of electronic assets will surely soon grow to include many substantial and serious things, for instance (and fundamentally) fungible credits good for generic processing power and/or storage.  Namecoin, while it has specific weaknesses that might mean it's not very useful in practice, does demonstrate the theoretical possibility that some such assets could be exchanged/indexed through cryptocoinish systems, but there will surely also be valuable assets exchanged through centralized systems or new decentralized models.  Cryptocurrency is an important foundation of this universe of electronic assets (or to put it differently, the lack of an internet currency has prevented it from fully emerging until now) but it will have many other facets. 
Second, the fact that cryptocurrencies other than the leaders in each algorithm are naturally fragile and untrustworthy *will not mean that they are completely without value* or unused.  I expect there to be a *very* long tail of "junk" cryptocoins which while *each* may be *almost* entirely worthless will still *collectively* amount to a substantial proportion of the cryptocurrency in circulation, perhaps even most of it.  These systems will *not* be trusted at all but they will be used anyway because they'll be so ridiculously cheap; the cost of risking momentary exposure to a vulnerable system will be *far* lower than the cost of (for instance) a Bitcoin transaction. 
For instance, I believe that most of the cryptocurrency transactions in the near future will be not between humans (directly) but between autonomous and semi-autonomous agents, computer programs that use cryptocurrency to negotiate for resources.  Many of these payments will be far smaller than payments between humans, and will only be *possible* in systems with low enough transaction costs.

I understand that intuition but I think the ordinary assumptions underlying it are probably evaporating. 
In the old world of huge amounts of economic friction, decisions made by humans in low-information situations under heavy control, it makes sense to assume that a network effect or any barrier at all really could be enough to keep value penned in. 
But we're talking about much more fluid markets and robotic agents-- for instance in order to accept litecoin as well as bitcoin you just need to list a litecoin price which automatically matches the exchange rate and then (assuming you don't want any exposure to litecoin) have an AI instantly convert any sales to BTC or whatever you do want to be holding.  The whole process could be written into open source vending systems, making accepting other currencies as easy as checking a box.  You really wouldn't check that box?  Pro: Access to customers who only have whatever alternate cryptocurrency, Con: Milliseconds of exposure to the value of whatever currency.  I think people will accept *everything*.

It's hard to know the proportions exactly of course but there's *already* a lot of transactions off of the blockchain.  There are hidden BTC-pegged currencies and credits *everywhere*-- exchange sites, merchant sites, games, rented accounts.  They don't say of course "we convert incoming deposits to a BTC-pegged internal centralized currency to avoid transaction costs while you're here" they just say "your balance is ฿x.yz click here if you want to withdraw it" as if it were somehow directly bitcoins themselves-- but it's not!

Hmm, no, not really.  If coins go from a documented purchase of yours to something illegal/questionable (though seedboxes *are* legal, for the moment) then that means one of three things: Either you tumbled the coins a bit and then bought the thing yourself, or you bought something from someone who bought it, or the coins were put into a mixer (either by you or by someone you bought something from) and their actual history got lost in the mixer.  In any case it's very difficult to prove exactly what actually happened just by looking at the blockchain, from either a legal or even a practical perspective.

There's a lot to learn, actually.  It's kinda hard to say what's most important, even.  It's a huge rush of new ideas.  Just don't invest more (in bitcoins or in any particular wallet technology or whatever) than you really really are comfortable with losing.  It's fine to just play around with a few bucks at first. 
In your comment history you say something about busking, one thing you might want to study is how to print out a big QR code for people to send donations to.  Those even make it possible for someone to send you a few cents if they see your performance in a video of it someone uploads to the internet. :O 
Which highlights one kinda difficult aspect of Bitcoin security you have to think about, is that if you give out an address you want to be pretty sure you're going to hold onto the private key for it like *forever*.  You don't want to have someone donating to some old address of yours they saw in an old video years later and you've forgotten that private key.  Yet while you're keeping those keys forever, if they're *ever* revealed to anyone else you've lost control of them. :O  So it makes you have to think differently about computer security.  There's really a lot to learn, and habits to change.  But it's a fascinating new world. :)

It's like we're programming these systems totally detached from reality.  We're actually programming like the abstractions of computer science.  So instead of reaching into reasonable solid coherent baskets or safes that would make sense to contain real limited things like money, we really write these programs that imagine themselves reaching into theoretical infinite series of money stretching to the horizon.  Whichever systems don't have a solid coherent reality inside of them will fail this cold test; Bitcoin insists these systems be made real inside.

Socialism isn't such a scary idea!  It's common sense really and essential.  We were born here on this planet in this solar system and none of us made the whole thing, we just made a few little contributions and alterations.  The question then is how we should make decisions about large shared things like planets.  Usually the example given is Earth, but that can get confusing, so let's take Mars shall we?  We've been given this nice red planet here.  Who should decide what happens to Mars?  We could maybe have a lottery to decide who gets to own all of Mars, and give it all to one person, but that would be pretty unreasonable. 
Here's a common sense answer for how we should decide what to do with Mars: People should have a say in what happens to Mars in proportion to how much it affects them.  At the moment maybe it affects everyone pretty much equally, NASA a bit more since they actually have a robot there.  Then if there were colonists living on Mars hopefully they'd have more say about what goes on there than the people back home, since it affects them more.  But that shouldn't mean that they get to be the exclusive owners of Mars forever, right?  If another wave of colonists land then they should also get a proportionate say in what happens on Mars now that it's their planet as well. 
The socialist position isn't that people shouldn't be able to own their own stuff.  Anarchist socialists particularly think people should be able to do *whatever* they want with their stuff.  The socialist position is about the ownership of *entire planets*, such as all of Earth.  We insist that nobody (save perhaps God, and most of us don't believe that either) made Earth, and thus Earth's resources should simply be shared in some vaguely reasonable system.  We're happy to take input on what that system could look like, just as long as the system isn't "I get all of it and you get nothing, suckaaaaaaaaaa."  OK? :P

They're right of course that bitcoin has a network effect.  But colored coin takes full advantage of that network effect, while not giving all of the advantages of the network to the early adopters (or to say it differently it makes a zillion new early adopters of the various colors).

It seems to many people like it must be some sort of scam or ponzi scheme that there is a bunch of money available to be made everywhere around the world just by trading between cash and bitcoin, but actually it makes perfect sense: Large profitable industries like electronic payments and consumer banking are in the process of rapidly and completely dissolving into a completely decentralized network of power.  That doesn't seem possible and so when it just happened just now nobody was ready for it.  **You can personally undercut all of the massive corporations in the financial industry (and even Mt Gox for that matter) in your own living room with hardly any capital, simply because of the radically decentralized nature of this system**.

That makes me think: Who says we're talking about large amounts of money?  Bitcoin doesn't have high barriers like that.  You could also just as well have someone say to you "could I please get some BTC for this $0.75" and you can say "OK sure I'll give you ฿0.005 for it" and you just scan their code, zero point zero zero five, send, done.  It's easy enough it might even be worth the trouble!

You literally have no distinction in your mind between Marxists and socialists as a whole?  That's wrong.  That's flatly wrong.  You're not going to have anything coherent to say about it until you get it basically sorted.  Socialism is a general term for political philosophies which call for the popular ownership of the means of production.  Marx was a particular prominent socialist thinker.  Someone who follows the teachings of Marx is a Marxist.  Therefore, since Marx proposed a particular socialist vision, all or almost all Marxists are socialists.  However, not all socialists agree with the ideas of Marx in particular.  Many or most socialists, while they want a society in which the means of production are owned by the people (which is what makes them socialist), do not particularly follow or endorse the teachings of Marx.  These are non-Marxist socialists.  I myself am a non-Marxist socialist.  I think Marx had some great points, and also some awful ones.  **I am offended by being called a Marxist, I am not a Marxist, and you should check yourself because you keep calling me a fucking Marxist WTF.**

Presumably you have the private key associated with that public key.  It's in your wallet.dat, which you should backup very carefully right away.  The number 1Ee5BkeP8Wd2ZA3mSKyJiKEq7Uhysknq2Y is what allows anyone to send money to that address, and also allows [anyone who knows it to see anything that happens there](  The private key, which is only in your wallet.dat, is what allows you to sign a transaction saying that bitcoins should *leave* that address.  If anyone gets that number in any way, for instance by hacking into your computer, they can instantly move the bitcoin themselves-- so choose the "encrypt wallet" option and choose a really good long password.  OK, but careful now, if that secret number in your wallet.dat is deleted or lost or even if you just forget that long hard password, *absolutely nobody in the world* can help you recover any bitcoin at that address-- that is the beauty and power of this system and that power is in your hands now.

The Anarchist idea is that to the extent there is any "government" the "government" is who owns the means of production, but also the government is exactly identical with the people, not any sort of representatives or agents of the people but just the people themselves directly as a whole self-governing.  So what it amounts to in practice is that the way decisions are made about what to do at a factory or any other place of employment is by everyone there having an equal say.  People have an equal say in how their own work happens.  It's a simple idea and the only sort of democracy worth shit.

I consider it a sign of the crypto economy's maturity that it's become impossible to get anything out of it for free.  There used to be BTC fountains, until BTC was worth something and of course they've all dried up by now.  Then there were ways to get some freeish altcoins for a while, with people giving out coins to encourage people to use them or whatever, but since everything's become very fluidly convertible to BTC there's now nearly as much suction draining away any free money of any sort.  It's frustrating that there's no more loose change lying around, but it's hopefully a sign that the system is more and more intelligently recognizing and rewarding value. 
It'll be another level of maturity when it becomes able to consistently reward small amounts of value.  There's still too much friction.  The tip bots have reduced the friction a lot, and there's a lot more people with little fractions of a coin as a result, but the friction is still substantial.  For instance I'm looking at a tip balance here of ฿0.00694737 but there's a minimum tip of, IDK what is it, just under a millibit?  It didn't used to let me tip a millibit because it was too small, which seemed silly.  Anyway, that's not many tips to go around from my seven hundred thousand satoshi budget.  But if I could slide you a single satoshi of course I would, it'd be silly to value what you said enough to write a response but to refuse to give you a single satoshi. 
Um I won't offer you a single satoshi but I suppose I could spare a milli but I don't really need anything um designed?  Do I? :)  See, too much friction, it'd be tens of thousands of satoshi of friction negotiating before we could even negotiate an exchange, hmm. :/

Governments have never succeeded at their stated purpose, it was always just an excuse.  They were formed by Kings with the story that they would benefit the people, but they were then and always have been since actually about empowering the King and nothing else.  What's wrong with governments is that they are fundamentally a lie.  They could only accurately be sold as a masochistic activity, a way to make societies far less effective by distorting their incentive structures into hellish torturous mazes.  There is nothing about hierarchical governance which is broadly beneficial.  **It is of course beneficial to those ruling and harmful to those ruled.**  It is of course endorsed and described as incredibly beneficial by those who it empowers, and they obviously have both a tremendous ulterior motive to present that perspective and the power to loudly repeat that message.  But it is not true.  It is a lie. 
Consider this: If a structure creates a hierarchy, where one group has more power than another to determine what happens in society, naturally the group with the power will benefit more from this arrangement, won't they?  There's no reason you should agree to that relationship if *you're* going to be on the oppressed side.  There is no benefit to being in the group that does not get to decide about their own lives. 
Anarchists support only government where people make for themselves all of the decisions that affect their lives.  We call this *self*-governance, or *autonomy*.  The only alternative to autonomous self-governance is to be governed by someone else, to have someone else decide the course of your life against your will.  There is no advantage at all *to you* of giving up control over your own life.  All of that advantage goes to the person taking control over you.  They will of course have a story as to why they deserve to control you.  They have a lot of resources so they can make it a very superficially compelling story.  But they cannot make it make deep sense.  It actually makes sense that you should control your own life.  There is no reason you should not.

It's not like they claim to have the consent of the governed, but if we go *check* and it turns out they don't actually consent quite so much they're going to pack up and go home.  I feel like asking them for the explanation of what legitimizes their actions is just asking them to move their lips, asking them to move their fingers and type us some nonsense.

The "benefits" that poor people get from the system are almost entirely false, though.  For instance poor people may "benefit" enormously on paper from getting roads made for them and subsidized loans to buy cars and subsidized gasoline, but then all they're able to do with those resources is use them to spend hours a day transporting themselves to a convenient place to slave for the capital that rules their life.  If a state actually begins to deeply distribute meaningful wealth from the rich to the poor it can only either (A) successfully do so and radically transform society or (B) (which is much more likely and common) itself be destroyed in the course of attempting to simultaneously confront *literally all* of the most powerful forces in society.

No.  The system doesn't have any way yet to distinguish humans.  It doesn't know which keys are owned by the same human(s).  It rewards agents who produce hashes because it needs the hashes to be secure, not just for fun.  It has to pay rewards to people who put in resources securing the network or it wouldn't be secured. 
It's not a property of Bitcoin it's a property of the universe.  If you have valuable things you can usually use that value to purchase or create even more value.  You can't solve that just by handing out something once for free.  The thing you hand out for free will immediately be captured by nearby capital, because that's how it works. 
You have to break the whole system and replace it with a radically different system that constantly redistributes wealth.  A union of everyone must directly claim control of the Earth for the benefit of all.  The process of capital accumulation will then continue, but if the agent which is using its capital to accumulate further capital is a union of all of humanity (or all intelligent beings on Earth, if/when that's different) only then can that accumulation benefit all of humanity instead of benefiting the owning class at the expense of the working class.

Why is this downvoted?  That's entirely relevant to this conversation.  If this reddit keeps being this mechanically opposed to considering the actual situation then might become a better place to find genuine discussion.  It's obvious why Bitcoin stackers are downvoting anything about Litecoin and it has nothing to do with having a productive conversation; if Litecoin has substantial value then Bitcoin still has a huge advantage as the first mover, maybe enough that it could end up worth a couple thousand dollars each or as much as gold, but probably not enough of an advantage to ever be worth "$100,000 to $1,000,000" each as they are openly fantasizing.  You cannot make something be worth a million dollars by downvoting, people.  If you feel you need to downvote to try to achieve your fantasy maybe you should consider whether it's realistically attainable. :/

And then all these people who come in here wanting to mine, someone will tell them, no, but you can store some data for a few coin.

I think it'd make sense to start an alt chain by forking the main Bitcoin blockchain such that everyone who has Bitcoin at the moment the system begins automatically gets some of the new alt coin.  Call it MirrorCoin.  Even if you sell the Bitcoin you had then, you'd still have the MirrorCoin, and vice versa.  It'd just be a way to give present Bitcoin users an incentive to try out the new coin.  One way to arrange it would be to have the mirrored part soon be a small part of the total, like if you mirrored BTC 1:1 but thereafter generated 1000 MirrorCoins a block so the initial BTC mirroring ones end up being only a small part of the total.  Or um conversely I guess you could make a new coin that mirrors the current BTC totals and then generates *less* mined coins into the future, hmm.

Imagine trying to sort out just one case where one party claims that bitcoins were "stolen" while another party claims that they were legitimately transferred.  Now multiply all that drama and stress you just imagined times infinity.  Just judging every possibly legitimate case is itself impossible.  Creating a system to even tell those meaningful cases apart from pure noise would be yet another impossibility. 
How after all do you decide who owns the bitcoins, who is the "true" owner?  We have collectively decided to tell the true owner of each account by their possession of a *secret*, a piece of data that only they know.  The agents in the system are only known or identified by these secrets.  Within this concept of identity and agency, the judgments of the Bitcoin network as to whether coins may be transferred are always perfectly fair.  By our law the person who transferred the coins *was* the owner, *by definition*, because they knew the secret.  Keep your keys close.

The work the miners do goes into producing very low hashes.  The reason those are valuable to us is that they're something which is very difficult to make.  They're not especially meaningful in some cosmic spiritual sense, but neither are diamonds, they're just carbon squished together really hard. 
Yeah, it's like they're making artificial diamonds.  Making artificial diamonds is expensive too, you put a bunch of power for a long time into making pressure, and all that happens by the end is you've rearranged some matter into an unusual and difficult to create shape. 
But like imagine it so we've arranged the carbon that's going to go into the diamond so that the diamond will have a message written in it, saying what all our transactions are.  We write our transactions and then we spend all this effort squishing them into a diamond and then we have this glittering perfect record. 
Why not just write the transactions on clay, or something cheaper?  Because then anyone can take some clay and write transactions and say "See, this is the official one!  I never spent those coins!"  But nobody's going to come up with a whole fake row of diamonds, just to fake the messages inside of them.  If they can make diamonds so easily, they'd be better off just selling diamonds then trying to pull some clever caper like that. :) 
So that's the value that we're creating is diamonds.  But um they're not made of carbon, they are made of SHA256 hashing.  We're discovering/creating these little glittering gems of hashes.  They're perfect, like a flawless gem.  Usually if you hash something you get random numbers, but these special ones we've mined from the mathematical earth start with an astonishing impossible zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, still zero, still zero, still zero, still fucking unbelievably zero. 
The miners just make us those hashes, those low low hashes.  That's enough.  That's extraordinary.

As others have said, the hard part is the currency conversion.  Sending five thousand dollars worth of bitcoins is *so* easy that it is *actually disturbing* the first few times how easy it is.  Choose who you want to send to, type in the amount, five thousand dollars worth, done, send.  That's it.  So then you're like, wait, did I *really* just send five thousand dollars?  That was it?  Meanwhile their computer or phone is already beeping a thousand miles away telling them the transaction is at every node in the world waiting to be confirmed.  Did that actually just happen?  Yes, it did.  Too easy, distirbuingly easy. 
The currency conversion is still hard.  But it gets easier every day.  Here's one way to think about how much easier it's getting and how quickly: The problem you have here is "help, I have $5,000 worth of BTC, and I want to convert it to pesos," which is a *perfect match* with a problem someone comes to this reddit with a *zillion times a day*, "help, I would really like to buy $5,000 worth of BTC, but it's so hard to find."  These two problems are of course rapidly annihilating each other, they are colliding matter and antimatter. 
You yourself asking that question is an important part of the dissolution of that particular barrier.  It is *not* easy to convert large amounts of bitcoin in Mexico.  That is an inconvenience but it's also a huge business opportunity while it lasts.

Occupy was just one particularly successful protest in a newly militant left with many interesting successes.  If you were actually asking then you might find it enlightening to study the [labor fight in Wisconsin]( shortly before Occupy Wall Street.  This period of militancy is continuing, for instance there's this radical grassroots organizing in New York's fast food industry.  There are of course no "accomplishments of Occupy" since "Occupy" is merely a brand name arising from a very successful protest tactic and not any particular organization.  But many of the organizations and actions under that banner have been very successful before, during and after that action. 
Wall Street fraudulently sold overvalued mortgage derivatives, which almost crashed the whole world's economy.  They also apparently fixed LIBOR and ISDAfix and the price of oil and probably just about everything else.  You haven't heard about that in spite of Occupy and everyone else trying to inform you?

It seems like the argument is, "Bitcoin could never be used for anything!  See this graph of the huge amount of bitcoin used to buy things every day?  It could be bigger!  Sure there's stores accepting it now in most countries of the world, but people aren't shopping there as much as they would if they were intentionally manipulated into shopping as much as humanly possible!"  Honestly I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.  It's as if they think Bitcoin is completely theoretical and they get to just make up what it would be like in their heads, they feel no need to consult any facts. 
When colored coins come out and lots of them have stable valuations everyone who talked up this meme gets to say "See?  That's why it's working now!  Because something's stable!"  But that won't even be true.  Stable is nice but this assertion that no one would/will/does buy things if the currency is too volatile is not just unrealistic but actually factually inaccurate.

It's very difficult to make a truly secure passphrase.  I would not assume that it's easy.  Length helps only if it comes from a variety of inputs, for instance a long phrase from a published work is useless.  Changes to dictionary words significantly increase the search space only if they are non-obvious; l33t sp33l1ng 1s k1nd@ 0bv10us.
With this sort of cracking something that *is* useful that you might not realize at first is to put *public* personal identifying information into the phrase, for instance instead of "correct horse battery staple" to make the phrase "UlyssesSKrunk correct horse battery staple"!  This is easy for you to remember, but it means that someone who is searching the entire space looking for any satoshi scattered to near-dictionary words cannot happen upon it.  You have limited your assailants to people specifically targeting you, or at least forced them to include every user name and email address and everything from the whole internets, still a pretty good gain.

Why are you on arguing against Bitcoin, what's the point?  Troll much?  You actually can buy "so much" with Bitcoin now, if you're interested.  I've bought a printer, flash drives, a dice bag with a reddit tip, domain registration, etc.  A pizza place just started accepting it in my town, with a 20% introductory discount.  You can shop at Amazon or plenty of other places online with Gyft.  There is in fact a growing economy with growing demand, factually; everyone's sales statistics are up QUADRUPLE DIGIT PERCENTAGES from last year.  The reason to spend BTC on these things is because you need or want them and because it's easy and fun and magic and perhaps because there's even a 20% discount or a rewards program!?  Things don't cost more in BTC; you don't miss out more on the upside of BTC by buying things in BTC.  If you want to stay invested at the same level in BTC while making purchases with it you can simply keep buying more to replace what you spend.  There's the same opportunity cost with every dollar or pound or Somali shilling anyone spends anywhere instead of investing it.

Well $0.34 is a really funny price for LTC, because I don't think there's anyone who thinks that's what it's worth!?  It's either going to be taken seriously as an alternative to Bitcoin (in the course of this present rapid expansion of cryptocurrency awareness), in which case it should be worth at least a few dollars, or it's going to continue to be marginal, in which case it should still be worth less than a dime.  I guess the current price is a volatile average of those because it represents an uncertainty as to which will happen.  I guess I'd like to see it succeed, because even if it's not that different it's not *exactly* the same and decentralization is the name of this game.  Anyway, faster confirmations is really quite pleasant!  I'd expect Litecoin to stick around.  It's not doing much harm and systems of this class are by design rather difficult to get rid of. ;)

I dunno that seems a small way to look at it.  Like OK zoom out a little.  You can have a system which is considered various serious tools by various people and/or simultaneously various games or entertainments to others, and you can have such systems accept and provide payments at any point for any reason in any cryptocurrency not just Bitcoin and also soon in specific colors of coin. 
Having a direct predictable exchange between a well known cryptocoin and something (anything) in a game adds a substantial solid value to that thing.  But that's just one texture of value you can give things.  You can make things hard as steel or soft as sand, as smooth as silk or as stuck as PayPal, you can give prizes or profits or punishments, things can track the markets or wax and wane with the moon. 
Putting cryptocurrency into a system substantiates all of its internal mechanisms which relate to that currency.  **It paints the inside of digital systems with magic paint that makes them real.**

Thank you very much!  I already [donated some of that euro to charity]( specifically to Tails, which is an awesome project.  People try to make the argument that society can't be supported by voluntary payments because altruism might not always be sufficient to support society-- which for one thing they should speak for themselves because I know a lot of really generous people but even leaving that aside-- altruism is just one of *many* motives for voluntary contributions.  I made that donation there out of some sort of sense of *spite*, for instance, I made it to shove it in that person's face that I could and did. :O  I dare them to claim there's not enough spite and rage and jealousy and confusion and pride and arrogance and *braggadocio* to fuel civilization. ;)

Malicious is in the eye of the peer.  Any collection of peers may peer together and have any consensus they like.  There's two levels to it.  Miners can mine various blocks, they can put different transactions in, and as long as the transactions are valid it's a valid block.  So there's some limited attacks you can do by mining valid blocks.  They're considered valid by the whole network, so if you have the hashing power to make them then the network will accept them.  Like you can make blocks that double spend one of your own transactions, because you can make two valid spends on the same coins and mine them or not into blocks.  What you can't do is change the underlying rules.  Or rather you can but no one listens to you.  If you mine a block where *all* the coins go from every address into your account, that's great, have fun with that, but every Bitcoin peer in the universe looks at that and says what the heck are you talking about.  Miners can only confirm blocks of valid transactions, nothing else, no matter how hard they try, that's what gives Bitcoin the internality that makes it a deeply interesting system.

It's not actually that simple.  Take for instance the bitcointip bot.  It's a central point of failure for reddit bitcoin tipping, which obviously isn't ideal but it's allowed us to get a scrappy little system working very quickly.  Theoretically if reddit completely banned the bot we'd have to create some more subtle underground distributed system to keep tipping, but that would be much more complex and difficult.  We should centralize some things when it's more efficient and it seems like we can get away with it.  Everything's not on 100% lockdown *quite* yet. :)

No one knows!?  Maybe nothing.  The game for the past few years has been to quickly get bitcoin out into circulation before there's any attempt to regulate it.  It's quite a cat to rebag at this point.  At the moment the situation seems to be that Bitcoin is instantly dissolving all of the world's capital controls and, well, probably the entire banking system and then all of the capital markets and the whole system is too frozen in place to do anything about it at all! :O  I wouldn't expect the dissolution of all of those powerful institutions and wealth to go completely smoothly though, would you?!  I don't know what exactly they're going to do to try to stop the slide but you'd think.. something!? 
Anyway avoiding Bitcoin in particular won't put you in any safe harbor.  It's just one of the many intense things we're all getting involved with.  This is a Singularity and things only get stranger and more dangerous from here. :) 
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:03:05
OK hmm well the central Bitcoin infrastructure *is* completely centralized and is theoretically vulnerable to attack at that central point-- but the central point is not in this universe.  So to speak.  It's in that virtual space projected by the program, it's in a physics that we write and enforce collectively.  It's got this sort of blood-brain-barrier where only certain things get through, only formal signed statements and difficult hashes get through, and the physics on the other side has an internality that can have any shape unaffected except by the energy/information it draws through that secure barrier. 
Fortunately we can both distribute and decentralize in every direction.  We can make alt chains-- we can make more spaces.  We can make merge mined chains-- even when we can't get any unauthorized information into a system we can still get secured info out and base other things on that.  We can just make a bunch of stuff.  Some of it depends on other parts, so maybe you could bring down a *whole lot* of it if you cracked a base part like Bitcoin itself or something.  But we're already to a point where we're redundant on most levels and can probably sustain really dramatic systemic attacks.  Each system is massively distributed and it's also a decentralized network of such systems-- when I try to think as the enemy that's really frustrating. 
One of the weakest points in many of the systems is the human.  Some people around these parts think the occasional intrusion of posthuman complexities is a sign that this system can't possibly work for anything, ha.  I think of it as a sign that this stuff is likely to be decreasingly owned by plain humans.

You shouldn't mine Bitcoin.  If you heard that in the media, I'm sorry, but they are wrong about that and many other things, for instance there's also no "Bitcoin company." ;) 
The best way to get Bitcoin is by offering people valuable products and services at a good price.  It's possible of course to get it by trading someone other money-- but think of this as *selling* old money for bitcoin, and consider carefully whether that's what you want to try to sell.  It's relatively easy of course to find a buyer at all (lots of people want money) but very hard to make a profit. :)

No one knows where the value of either coin will go.  But I think it's healthy and cooperative to support Litecoin or *something* just so we don't have all our eggs in one basket. 
Many people here are heavily invested in Bitcoin so of course they don't want other options seriously considered.  A lot of their arguments are specious though, for instance the idea that Litecoin shouldn't have any value at all because of how strong the Bitcoin ecosystem is these days-- it's easy and instant and nearly free to change litecoin into bitcoin, so strengths of the Bitcoin economy are mostly mutually beneficial with Litecoin. 
My impression is that Litecoin has some chance of success, and Bitcoin has some chance of failure, and this is somewhat fairly represented in their prices.  Neither of them are especially trustworthy stores of value in the short term, really, but they do both have some value, and either might turn out to be a good investment at these prices.

People are putting money into it to store value, but instead of just storing their value it's becoming way *more* valuable all the time!!  That's not right!

Well obviously you can issue stuff.  You didn't were just the first to think of that.  The question is *where* people will issue things.  You're assuming they should put out whole new coin systems but that has significant risks/costs so I doubt it's the most cost effective way most of the time.  I expect we'll have a number of chains based on underlying security algorithms, not on what's stored on them, and casual issuance of new assets by coloring of coins on those few chains.  Coin coloring is completely free and inherits all of the security of the underlying chain.

What you keep on the paper when you make a paper wallet is just a private key, a long secret number.  The bitcoin are actually stored publicly on every computer on the network simultaneously (that's why they're impossible to destroy or change, because there's a zillion copies).  What you keep on the paper is the key that allows you to cryptographically sign a public statement saying that those particular bitcoin should officially be transferred to someone else. 
If someone claims the coins should be moved, everyone can tell by checking the signature whether the person who said that actually has the private key connected to the bitcoin.  If and only if it checks out, they all consider the coins moved.  So knowing that secret number is exactly the same as owning/controlling the bitcoin in that account, because with that number you can sign a statement saying to move it wherever you want-- another account you control, or someone else's account to buy something or settle a debt, or whoever you want to have it. 
So to really completely secure some bitcoin, all you have to do is make a few copies of the secret key for some account and hide them somehow.  You can keep the number in a safe or anywhere.  No one (even you, if you don't have a copy of the number outside the safe) will be able to sign any statements moving the bitcoin without the number, so they'll stay put.  All you need in order to put money into that account is the public key-- you just use a different private key, of whatever account you want to move coin from, to sign a statement saying that you want to move some bitcoin to the public key that matches the private key in the safe. 
It seems like magic that you can beam money into a piece of paper hidden in a safe using a worldwide distributed network of cryptography, but that's the modern world for you I guess. :)

That's proven to be a terrible way to conduct medicine.  When people thought that way, the surgeons were ridiculously arrogant.  Medicine is improving at this moment by instituting a system that relies less on the authority of the surgeons.  The surgeons are being required to follow an external agreement, a checklist.  This system is proven to be much more effective so you'd better hope it's what's used when they remove your theoretical tumor actually.  One of the things on the list is that the surgeon should know the names of everyone else in the room-- that they should have any basic fucking respect for them.  Having respect and working cooperatively improves outcomes.  Hierarchy is intentional reduction in systematic intelligence because of a simplistic hard-wired war-game feeling.

It would be if you were holding a particular stock, and someone offered to trade you some more of the same stock, and you said "no, I can't accept that stock from you, even though I'm holding it myself, because it's too volatile."  Maybe if there was some limit to how much of the stock you wanted to hold, and you had already hit that limit, you'd say, sorry, I don't want any *more* of that stock.  Sure, makes sense!  That's why it *doesn't* make sense to say that Bitcoin is dooooooomed because people will necessarily hold it because they think it might be worth more in the future.  Someone will to some degree but everyone can't infinitely.  It's also uncertain whether it will increase in value or how quickly, meaning that someone somewhere is going to want to *sell* now, so there will continue to be supply of the currency.  Which is obvious and so I don't think you actually mean to be arguing against it.  I don't think anyone anywhere really completely meant to be making that argument, that Bitcoin can't possibly work because it goes up in value so no one will ever sell it (because we're all so rational in managing our vast holdings that we would never sell something if it was most likely to profit us, ha).  All I'm saying is that as well as the many other reasons that argument is silly (Bitcoin *isn't* magically deflationary) it also blatantly contradicts the argument that bitcoin is useless because it's volatile, because if it's volatile then it's *not* always going up in value and someone *is* indeed selling.  I dunno where this conversation went off the rails exactly but I'm pretty sure we stopped getting anywhere.

The main bitcoin-qt client is fine, you just have to run it for a long time for it to be synced the first time but you don't have to do anything, just set it up and run it sometimes and eventually it'll catch up.  It's worth it just to experience keeping some coin *directly* under your own control (make sure to make backups and choose good passphrases)!  There's plenty of other desktop clients and it won't hurt to try another one too, even at the same time.  You can also make a blockchain.info wallet for free, so why not, it can be accessed from anywhere and has some other useful features.  The tip bot makes you another blockchain.info account that you might want to keep separate from your main one.  And might as well make a few instawallets too to see what happens.

Oh certainly there are problems with a new chain.  That's why everyone was heading towards the most likely first implementation being coloring Bitcoin.  But these choppy waters for microtransactions on Bitcoin does change the balance somewhat, and it's worth considering whether Bitcoin is still the easiest route.  I don't claim to know.
1. Wherever colored coins are hosted it'll be possible (though difficult) to make proxies/gateways to other currencies.  Bitcoin already has BTC, of course, but we still need to make gateways to USD or anything else, so we still have most of this problem anywhere. 
2. Ripple sounds nice on paper, but so far in practice it's actually a closed source centralized system, so it's still only a theoretical possibility as far as I'm concerned. 
3. It'll take a while before *Bitcoin* stabilizes!!  It's true that a new chain would be even *more* unstable (one of the few things in the *universe* even more unstable than Bitcoin) but also everything about coin coloring will continue to be alpha anyway.  It's not going to be a very stable system overnight no matter what. 
4. Yeah, it's opening a can of worms.  Like on the BitcoinX mailing list recently someone was like "hey, why don't we just change the whole architecture and split the whole transaction tree so you can just follow the coins you care about" and someone else was like "noooooooo, then you're not securing the whole system as well" &amp; etc.  Once you're talking about starting from scratch everyone finds an itch.  It's a bunch of work and drama but then again if we *did* come up with a system better in numerous respects, that would be-- awesome!? 
New chains aren't an all or nothing question, is another aspect.  There's merge mining and maybe other ways of making chains intimately connected to one another so they partially share security resources.  So it's not even necessarily even as simple a question as whether to be on Bitcoin or a completely new base, there's also intermediate options. 
I fully expect every chain to have coloring at some point.  Why not?  It's possible, it's nearly free, so why not.

I think one of the best deals in bitcoin today is giving a few millibits to someone new to bitcoin.  Seriously, that's a lot of social capital for a tiny amount of money!  Each person is only new to bitcoin once so this is your only chance to be the first person to ever send them some. 
What I've been thinking about is the market for labor in bitcoin, particularly telecommuting labor, people doing things for people over the internet.  I feel like there's a lot of potential to not just translate other markets that are succeeding in other currencies but to actually create something new.  In the process of requesting and receiving intellectual and artistic creations, advice and assistance, reports and recommendations, etc., the transfer of payment is by far the greatest friction remaining.  We're so used to that friction that now that it's lifting (and by now I mean just recently, when not just bitcoin itself but the whole infrastructure has gotten to be usable by a variety of people) we have to recalibrate and reimagine what's possible. 
What I'm working on is this kind of reproducing, evolving social process I've been inventing.  I think that adding currency to them could maybe help grease their wheels so they move a bit more smoothly.  At the moment a process has to evolve to be pleasant and seem fair to all of its participants simultaneously.  For instance if a process was (approximating) "person A requests a scene they want a picture of, person B draws the scene, person A sees it and says how awesome it is, make two copies and start them" then person B is likely to say "well this doesn't seem fair, I make you a picture but you don't do anything for me."  So it's a bit like arranging barter trying to arrange the crossing of benefits to satisfy everyone involved in the process.  So I'm going to try to inject micro currency transfers as a way of allowing it to move more gracefully through less delicately balanced arrangements.

Sure, there's little reason for new structures not to interoperate well with Bitcoin.  But pegging a structure's value entirely to the BTC isn't the only possible way to do that.  It works fine to float.  For instance there is one thing litecoin is definitely useful for at the moment, the thing almost every litecoin miner seems to do with it: It can very easily be converted to bitcoin at the floating rate, which is pathetic *but not zero*.  For another instance it gets easier every day to exchange bitcoins for Linden Dollars, which have some value because exchanging them for virtual goods is programmed into Second Life.  Bitcoin is going to be exchangeable for an infinity of virtual goods including numerous other currencies.  Most of those currencies will continue to be fairly worthless, but that just means you can get a ridiculous amount of them for hardly any BTC, which to me implies that lots of people will have a bunch of a variety of them, because why not?  That's not a recipe for bitcoin dominating every ecommerce niche for eternity.  There's going to be diversity.

Disproportionate to what?  Large balances can be controlled by agents representing many humans.  Numerous dust balances can be all controlled by the same human.  That's one of the usefully bizarre properties of Bitcoin is that it's really hard to tell from the blockchain what the fuck is going on.  It's possible to get some information from studying the transactions, but you have to really go into the detail, to try to figure out what all the dust *means* and what those giant balances *are* or represent.  Blockchains encode meanings, but complicated, cryptic, and sometimes even encrypted meanings.

All you need to do to accept bitcoin donations is list an address.  There's no need for any third party mechanism to deliver the donations to you, anyone can place a donation directly from one of their accounts into your donation account for nearly free. 
The only catch is that you must commit to keeping a secure copy of the private keys associated with the donation addresses you post for a very very long time, pretty much forever.  You can never know where your post might have been copied or who might have saved the address, so you'll need to keep the keys forever in case coins are ever dropped there. 
If your private keys are ever revealed or lost then you absolutely will not be able to recover any coin sent to the account and no one in the world can help you.  That's the flip side of no one being able to steal or confiscate your money, is that you yourself can't steal or confiscate it either unless you keep that precious key.  Encrypt your keys with a good passphrase and make copies.  You're most likely to lose your keys by losing all your copies.  Someone physically stealing and cracking a copy is a theoretical risk but very rare. 
Welcome!  Thanks for your interest!  Have you tried installing the normal Bitcoin client, Bitcoin-QT?  If you run it with the command line option "-testnet" it'll run on a network very similar to the Bitcoin network except that the coins there are worthless.

Looks like that's about how successful running a full Bitcoin node is going to be, yup.  Mostly people are going to have the nodes that relay their transactions on Linux machines owned by someone else, like blockchain.info and Coinbase.  Mostly everyone switched everything to Linux a few years ago by accessing it remotely and having someone else maintain it, which I guess was a reasonable strategy in retrospect.  The problem here I guess is that Windows isn't even secure enough to be a useful thin client. :/

Well sure, in any system full cooperation would be ideal.  Anarchists don't just wish for cooperation, though, we've thought seriously about how to achieve it.  We find that cooperation is only possible in the absence of domination.  Consider two agents A and B.  If A has the power to make B do what they say, what are the chances of peaceful cooperation between A and B?  Conversely, if neither A nor B can have power over the other, what then are the chances of peaceful cooperation?

Well the problem is that not everyone has any bitcoin yet.  There's a lot more people wanting to work for bitcoin than there are people hiring, which means the price is really really *really* low.  So since now you know that, you could turn around and instead get an awesome deal hiring people for pennies to do awesome interesting stuff for you-- except that you don't have any bitcoin to hire them with.  So as soon as there's more people with bitcoin it'll get more reasonable, but it just has to take a while to even out.  Even by the end of this year it'll be a lot different.  Meanwhile, if you take the going rate for labor in bitcoin it isn't really THAT bad a deal-- for one thing it should be enough to hire other people who are working just as cheaply as you just did. :D

Sigh, fucking ancaps.  They really have confused the fuck out of you.  I'm so sorry they did that to you.  There are no such thing as capitalist anarchists, except to the extent that words may be freely redefined by those speaking them.  The tradition of Anarchism is a socialist tradition.  We advocate that all aspects of society should be entirely controlled by those affected by them, in fair proportion to how much they are affected.  For instance the decisions about what happens to a road must be made directly by those affected by and involved with that road, such as those who drive on it or who live near by it.  If you think about it the necessary logical effect of giving people such power over the material and social conditions of their lives is what's also known as socialism, or the *social ownership of the means of production*.  Whoever controls the essential elements of society such as the roads controls all production, controls everything, controls everyone.  There is no way to have freedom except for the people of each place to decide for themselves what roads to make and what structure of society to make with them.

Hello!  The question with "securing" your wallet is *against what* are you securing it.  The people who are putting the Raspberry Pi they generate the keys with into the safe and making sure there's nothing lingering in their printer's memory are mostly considering adversaries such as the *US Government* and other such powerful agents, agents with the power to have backdoors into printer firmware or whatever other exotic threat model.  They are also probably putting in rather a lot of money.  If you're just spending a little money and you do not anticipate adversaries with great powers you do not need to take these precautions. 
There are rather a lot of people on the internet accepting Bitcoin for all sorts of things, but indeed if no one is selling anything you'd like to buy for Bitcoin then you don't need any right now, unless you'd just like to hold some.  Perhaps instead of trying to buy bitcoin for fiat you could *offer* a good or service-- if you're right that there's hardly anyone selling anything, even though lots of people have BTC and want to spend, then it won't be hard at all for you to find a profitable niche, now will it? ;)
I don't own any BTC right now and I can't stand it!  I'm going to have to get more, because for me it's really useful.  For instance I've gotten totally addicted to giving out tips here on Reddit.  If I had any coin in my tip account then I could tip you right now and force you to have BTC whether you want it or not. :P

No, the amount of computing power you have only allows you to determine the  *ordering* of messages within a small time window.  You cannot stop messages from eventually transmitting, you cannot forge messages, etc.  There's strong constraints that give an internality to the rules enforced by the wider consensus, by the consensus of all nodes.
This is the brilliance of this invention, how the virtual is able to become the mover instead of the moved.  The consensus of the broader network creates a fully virtual world which is the only space in which bitcoins themselves exist.  Within that virtual space it creates virtual payments, which it can then connect to motions of objects in the real world only by connecting them to the motions of *secrets*.  By identifying agents by their secrets it's able to give something with enforceable rarity to real miners to produce expensive transaction resources with real resources from the real world.  It's able to verify the authenticity of those transaction records and the amount of effort put into them and thus to gradually build and share a cohesive record that can't be counterfeit.

It's an actual thing with actual properties.  It does have intrinsic value.  It has way more intrinsic value than gold.  You can use Bitcoin to store a secure distributed ledger of accounts.  At the moment all it stores an accounting of is the movements of bitcoins themselves, but soon coin coloring will allow it to be used to issue new currencies or stocks or anything you want to keep a secure distributed account ledger for. 
The value of Bitcoin is in the size of the network, because it provides security.  Terracoin is exactly the same system but nearly worthless because there's hardly anything securing it.  With a Bitcoin account someone would need to move heaven and earth to alter your transactions.  With a Terracoin account they might just need a couple of spare ASICs.  Bitcoin allows you to store a record of transactions that absolutely cannot be falsified or altered by anyone on earth. 
To estimate the value of Bitcoin as a whole, you have to add up what markets you think it can disrupt (and when and with what likelihood) and then divide between the cryptocurrencies that survive (proportional to how much of a market share each obtains). 
My estimation is that the value of the markets Bitcoin is likely to disrupt is massive and that few or none of the competing cryptocurrencies are likely to gain much of the total cryptocurrency transaction market in the short term (though I do expect it to spread to many more currencies in the longer term).  My estimate therefore is that the value of a bitcoin right now is at least a thousand dollars.  I think the market is currently getting it wrong simply because that's hard to believe.

Sure I'll give it a shot!  You know how every transaction in the history of Bitcoin is all in this one ledger we have, right?  So if you choose any transaction in that ledger, you can follow those coins from there, seeing where they go.  Coin coloring doesn't change Bitcoin itself at all, it's just a different way of *understanding* the information in the Bitcoin ledger. 
Instead of understanding all the coins as being "the same thing" regardless of their history, a client that understands coin coloring can treat coins differently depending on what's happened to them.  It can make transactions intentionally spending coins of a particular "color" (that is, coming from one particular originating transaction) or trading coins of one color for another color. 
You can even make "atomic" transactions where you and another person agree to trade this many of this color for that many of that color (or whatever complicated arrangement) and the whole deal goes on the blockchain together as one thing.  There's no way for either person to not follow through on their end of the deal.  This could be way cheaper than systems that require a trusted third party like an exchange.

My intuition is that it's just the beginning and it's going to get way more intense and much stranger. 
For instance since so far we just have this one thing we can magically pass around with reddit comments, it seems silly if two people tip each other back and forth while they're chatting (I still think it's rational, but then I do like being silly).  On the other hand if we had various tip bots transporting *various* cryptocurrencies, then I could tip you some bitcoin and you could tip me back some litecoin and then I'd tip you some something else, and the whole thing would become not exactly a *market* for currency trading but still *some* sort of chaotic new flowing rearrangement of currencies. 
Or for another instance we could speak into existence other economic events and instruments than just transfers.  Like maybe I could say here a magic phrase that means "extend a line of credit to Zidane8998 of ฿0.01 at 0% interest and then ฿0.1 at 0.1%" and a bot would remember that in the future if you need a loan-- right now we generously randomly share coins here, yet if you want to buy something you need *exactly* enough coins, there's not a satoshi of wiggle room.  But we can gradually stir in this magic squishiness.  I dunno, imitating old stuff like tips and loans is just the beginning of the beginning, I think, really.  It's going to have other new kinds of squishiness too and become a system that really feels totally different than how money used to feel.

Here's a slight modification: The system could be introduced gradually by having the bitcoin payments appear in signatures automatically added to otherwise normal emails.  If you looked at them with a normal email client, it would just say at the end of the email something like "this email has ฿whatever attached to it, click here to claim it" and if you clicked through it would have a place to put your bitcoin address manually to get the payment along with an explanation linking to email clients that parse the signatures automatically so you can collect the payments more easily in the future.  In a compliant client the magic signatures disappear; instead of having to click through to them they're all automatically verified by the program and the emails are just marked as to whether they really paid you anything, so you can avoid spam by sorting the messages by how much ฿ was on them.

This particular strategy does seem mildly sketchy, but I agree that it's fine to do something sketchy with a little bit of bitcoin-- it's funny how a dime of fiat we're happy to toss around and tuck in a pocket and give or lose as the worthless little thing it is, yet we obsess about security procedures for an account with a dime worth of bitcoin.  We have lots of strange inertial intuitions. 
But anyway what I really find interesting about this is the artful way it's hacked together.  We're hacking together all kinds of stuff out of this bitcoin machinery we've been building.  The Bitcoin network is a solid foundation to build on, and then the blockchain.info wallets are a bit shakier but we risk it to get the height, the interfaces, the API, and then the tip bot is another floor on top of that, shaky trust on shaky trust, but worth the risk to get even higher and get a little more of a view. 
It's most rational of course to just put tiny dimes only for moments at the pinnacle of these towers we build, and of course we'll get it wrong again and again and put too much trust in the wrong things.  But it's right for us to be wrong, for us to keep trying to reach.

That's a *metaphor* that this particular device was founded around, but in practice it's just a tool that sends bitcoins when you say the right magic words on reddit, and we've been inventing various structures based on that tool.  Some "tips" are tips, but some are just to play around, some are to pay off bets or pay back debts, some are to reward participants in a crowdsourced project, etc.  I expect we'll advance quickly both in ideas of how to use this technology and in new similar tools for making magical things happen on the web.

That's how I thought it worked at first too, but since then I have been able to watch all of my tips on the blockchain so I was wrong.  You still have to trust the bot, as it has the keys to all of the addresses it makes for everyone and if NerdfighterSean turned evil it could be changed to simultaneously transfer out all of everyone's tip bot funds.  But keeping everyone's funds in their own account does at least ensure that the tip bot is 100% reserve.

No it seriously violates basic well known laws of physics.  In our universe copying information has only local effects.  Your system depends upon knowing at a distance whether information has been copied.  Just be honest and rewrite the damned system in terms of the surveillance regime required to enforce it so we can be clear about what degree of surveillance and repression you are promoting instead of pretending this bullshit.
People pay for music online because they're misinformed and you've hired a gang of armed people to roam around enforcing rules that they only vaguely understand and they're scared to death and they can afford $0.99 more than they can afford the risk of being randomly accosted by this Kafkaesque nightmare bureaucracy for any reason.  If that's your basis for forming policy going forward you are a cruel person and hopefully wrong about humanity's potential.

Hmm which brainwallets are most like wishing wells?  But what I mean is, what happens if there's coins being tossed to the same simple addresses every once in a while, and everyone's prepared for that and watching those addresses?

The reason why the transactions are public is to prevent double spends.  You can keep transactions secret if parties trust one another, I think that's what Ripple does but I'm not sure!?  Anyway the only information you leak on the blockchain is that there is some account of unidentified ownership that makes the transaction.  It's very easy to leak elsewhere the information of who the account is connected to, but it's just very easy to leak information in general, that's life in an information rich continuum like ours. :)

Occupy became more focused on itself as it grew.  I think that makes perfect sense.  When it's a tiny little thing, the enemy is all *out there*.  But as it incorporates various energies into itself, more tensions are brought in as well, so it makes sense to redirect energy towards internal dialog and mediation. 
OK, consider this *reductio ad absurdum*: If literally everyone in the world joined Occupy, it would of course no longer be a matter of Occupy protesting some external enemy at all-- *every problem in the world* would then be internal to Occupy.  So there is *some* level of growth at which introspection is absolutely necessary. 
So you could argue then that Occupy became introspective and broadened its concerns far too early, and there's perhaps some truth to that.  I think the internal logic of it is that while Occupy hadn't saturated the *general* population, it had deeply saturated the *activist* population, including various factions (liberal reformists vs anarchists vs right libertarians vs authoritarian socialists) that hadn't really hung out much at all before that in recent history.  So there was a dialog that *needed* to happen there and that did at least begin to, and that's deeply changed many of the world's activist cultures in fundamental ways.

Yeah and it's unlikely that it's most rational to take official listed transaction fee size as the only signal in what transactions you list.  But the cleverness of the system is that it at least allows us to smooth out over those untrustworthinesses to a reliable coherent consensus if we wait *long enough*.  Alterations in the question of how untrustworthy miners can or are willing to be can't exactly fundamentally break the system, it can at very most radically change our notion of how many confirmations is *enough* to believe in the ordering. 
It is pretty much unthinkable that any devious scheme imaginable could make us have to wait a whole *week* to secure a transaction, for instance-- it's just way too many chances for blocks to be found for a wide variety of reasons.  On the other hand, our current guidance that you should wait a full *hour* to consider a transaction safe already leaves room for a *tremendous* amount of untrustworthiness and evil. 
If there was no fear of anyone breaking the rules at all you wouldn't have to wait even a single confirmation to be sure, a bitcoin could trade hands a dozen times before any of the transactions were confirmed and the twelfth person could say "Well, sure, I'll take that!  Looks good!  All those transactions will surely be confirmed by the trustworthy folks mining the Bitcoin network, and surely none of you are double-spending with anyone else, since everything is so friendly here in Happy Altruism Land!"

The state wasn't set up by some independent commission using game theory to rationally maximize everyone's benefit.  It's just a haphazard historical accidental descendant of plain feudalism.  If you're just neutrally setting up a system and thinking clearly about the incentive structures it's easy to make systems that encourage cooperation with peaceful positive rewards. 
Bitcoin for instance is simply a voluntary agreement to provide rewards for healthy behavior larger than the rewards for defection.  People freely agree to participate in Bitcoin because they can see how the reward structure encourages behavior that benefits them.  It's easy to get agreements about structures like that that are actually sensible and neutral. 
What's difficult is getting people to agree to a system that's not actually mutually beneficial at all.  It's difficult to get people to agree to a system that is directly harmful to them or their community or their race or their gender.  That has been the problem of every state in history in practice, that they have actually been enforcing terrible systems of oppression and not anything beneficial at all.

Sure, I'm still excited enough about it to explain it!  Well Casascius developed it I think to make more secure physical bitcoins, but it turns out that's just one application.  What it does is it lets you put some BTC on the chain, without being able to get them out yourself!  Someone else can get them out, with a passphrase only they know. 
So Casascius's application for that is that you send the intermediate result from your passphrase, from which he can't determine your passphrase, and he computes from that a number that can be combined with your passphrase (which he still doesn't know) to make a private key (which he doesn't know), and the public key associated with it.  He then sends you a physical bar that you can use to store BTC without needing to trust him not to have remembered your private key (since he never knew it). 
But now that we've thought about it for a while, there's other ways you could use that same technology.  For instance, two-party escrow.  Instead of sending the coins directly to the seller, the buyer sends the coins out onto the blockchain into limbo.  It's as if the buyer has made a two-factor physical bitcoin like Casascius does (except that it's not physical) and sent the agreed price to it (which can be confirmed on the blockchain) but then doesn't actually send it to the seller until the seller holds up their end of the deal. 
The buyer can't take back the coins if they're unhappy with the seller.  Their only choices are to release the intermediate code to the seller (which the seller can combine with the passphrase only they know to release the coins) or to keep it secret and punish the seller by leaving the coins in limbo forever.  Probably usually what they'd say is "I'll release the coins if and when I ever actually get what I ordered!" 
An implementation of this protocol is at:  
Of course that has the small problem that it just switches the party with the ability to be uncooperative, from sellers not sending product to buyers instead being able to withhold payment.  It's often not a problem in practice, since there's little motive for the buyer not to release the coins if they ought to since they can't get to them themselves.  But of course the buyer could die or fall off the net or forget, or you could have a buyer you really don't trust at *all*.  For these cases a similar arrangement has been figured out that allows third party escrow, where there's an agreed neutral party who can move the coins either to the seller or back to the buyer depending on their judgment of what's proper (but there's no way the escrow could just keep the coins themselves).  This is implemented by:  
I think that's huge.  I think it just hasn't been noticed yet because it's kinda difficult to explain, I mean it's basically a complicated math trick.  But the basic result is coins stuck on the blockchain that only a certain agent has the power to release only to certain others, which could have any number of practical uses.

That would sorta make sense, wouldn't it?  I mean, since cryptocurrency inherently destroys many established traditions and institutions, you'd think they'd, um, notice and do something about it.  But that's not the vibe I'm getting. 
The feeling I have is that it's moved too fast and there's not going to be any response at all.  They're going to pretend nothing happened and wait until it ends them up from inside and *then* decide what to do.  Is that rational long-term?  No.  Is that rational short-term?  Yes, the political optics of standing up and saying "Hey!  This cryptocurrency thing that no one's ever heard of!  It's a major threat to everything and we must ban it immediately!" are just awful. 
It feels to me like it's just this weird weird situation where the governments' fingers are too fat for them to grasp this deadly mosquito before the strike.  But on a larger level it makes narrative sense; we *must* expect that there will *somehow* be the dissolution of all old institutions in the progress of the Singularity.

It was just so well executed and so resonant with the problems confronting society that it caught fire so dramatically that you can with a straight face compare it with entire movements that took years to organize similar protests.  To judge Occupy a failure you must judge it on the standard of something enormous.  Yes, as an interstellar empire it was a failure; it burnt out rather quickly.

It's not *necessarily* scamming people to sell them a currency, but it certainly *can* be.  You *can* be intentionally lying to someone about a currency in order to get them to agree to a deal that you know isn't in their interests.  I don't think is *successfully* scamming anyone on currency prices, particularly, but they seem to have just openly stated on this thread their *intention* to do so; they've proudly and aggressively and insultingly boasted that they'd consider it not just acceptable behavior but somehow in a twisted way *obligatory*, and they're frankly promising that they'd behave that way in any "market place" anyone made the mistake of trading with them on, out of some sense that it's actually a particularly realistic or sustainable strategy to be *intentionally mean to people*.  There's a *lot* of that around here and it strikes me as astonishingly odd and wrong.

I don't think having centralized local currencies backed by BTC defeats the purpose of Bitcoin.  Most local currencies right now are backed by nothing or fiat, so how is it not better than that?  Counterfeit is obviously a problem with any currency, there's various ways to mitigate it.

There's some computations you can rent generically from a network, but it's not simple.  Bitcoin is the largest computer in the world mostly because it's managed to create a properly balanced nearly-trust-free incentive system to rent its computation.  There are few or no other successful systems.  Namecoin is perhaps another example, but it's only somewhat successful (and also only somewhat independent from Bitcoin as it's merge-mined). 
At least in the short-term, until we've solved that hard problem more generically, I think the most cost-effective thing for people to do with their small, internet connected computers is not to provide generic computation but rather to provide specific small-scale services.  For instance your home computer could run a small online game, or rent out a little bit of storage space, or run a coin related service like an exchange or mixer for some obscure underserved altcoins, or do some sort of automated escrow, or generate pretty pictures and post them for tips or to sell hi res versions, or anything. 
We don't even need to work hard figuring out what would be the most efficient use of people's computing resources.  We can just start randomly putting out anything we can think of that people can run that'll generate any satoshi at all.  As soon as any possibilities at all exist, people will study and obsess about and perfect them like they do about mining, creating careful comparisons of everything's earning potential for each kind of hardware in particular and considering every variable and everything will become perfectly clear. :)

No look you're wrong about your particular example.  It's your example; it's an unforced error.  The checklist that "has no idea what the hell is actually happening in the room" was scientifically validated as the most accurate way to decide what to do, so that's what we're switching to.  Surgeons don't just randomly decide what to cut when they're operating.  You'd better hope your surgeon goes by the book.  You chose the wrongest wrong example imaginable. 
OK look smarty pants, your surgeon has just lost his mind and told the assistant to do something that will obviously kill you.  The surgeon says it's because Jesus Christ just informed them that you have to die.  What should the assistant do?  Obey the surgeon unquestioningly?  OR SHOULD THEY ONLY OBEY ORDERS FROM THE SURGEON IF THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEY REPRESENT ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SITUATION YOU FOOL???

I've been feeling like maybe it's lucky for Bitcoin that it came around when it did *because anonymity was still so hard then*.  If the onions had come first, with unsecured currencies issued by unidentified agents, the initial story of Bitcoin would have been entirely different-- "new online currency where you don't have to trust those shady characters!" 
But speaking of shady characters, it has taken me a while to piece together what's actually going on and to realize that this Silk Road thing is a *bank*.  People mostly for some reason talk about how they sell drugs there which is interesting I suppose but they do sell drugs *lots* of places so that's pretty ordinary really.  What's really bizarrely *different* about it, to my mind, is that it appears to be a massive illegal bank.  The drug purchasers are all here on Reddit talking about how they have money on deposit there-- particularly about the exchange rate, which incidentally has got to be one of the most bizarre consequences of Bitcoin, all of these addicts/dealers suddenly turned part time currency speculators. :O 
One of the uncertainties of this underworld banking seems to be alleviated by the assumption that the Dread Pirate Roberts is holding *more* than 100% of the BTC deposited.  But to my knowledge there's no proof of that.  And I'd be surprised if Anonymous partial reserve Bitcoin banks didn't emerge soon.  Plus whatever other bizarre financial instruments anyone wants to come up with now that there's no one to stop them.  It boggles the mind.

Accepting Bitcoin as payment and holding it as an investment are separate decisions that you're conflating here.  There's nothing wrong with converting into fiat (or LTC) instantly if that's what you want to hold.

Well, maybe the social contract about Bitcoin will change to allow tainting.  There's a lot of resistance to it, but coin coloring is coming from the other side so that'll start to muddy the waters anyway.

This person known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto invented a clever new tool for securing a distributed system.  The problem it solves is known as the "Byzantine Generals' Problem" which is in short that if you have a decentralized network of equal peers running a system, how do you know whether what another node is telling you about the system is true?  How do you stop people from just joining the network and lying?  An obvious solution like just asking a bunch of nodes instead of just one doesn't work if a liar could cheaply pretend to be thousands of nodes.  How do you guarantee you're getting accurate and up-to-date information about what's going on in a chaotic distributed system, when you can only ask strangers who might be lying to you? 
The solution presented by Bitcoin is that all of the nodes agree to believe that the "true" version of events is the version which has the most computation put into it.  Everybody works together putting computation into a shared history of events, and then you can recognize that as the "true" (that is, agreed upon) narrative because it's the one that can't be reproduced without a bunch of expensive computation.  You can still pretend to be as many Bitcoin nodes as you want, but nobody will believe your fake nodes because you can't make a whole fake blockchain for them to send to people as a lie, because you don't have enough computers to make your fake blockchain as impressive as the real one. 
That's actually a huge thing, if you think about it, that now you can have a distributed peer-to-peer network agree together on a history of what happened, even if there are many nodes that are lying (or just broken).  That means we can make a network that's stronger together than just the sum of its parts.  There's zillions of computers around the world running the Bitcoin network, and lots of them *do* fuck up or break all the time, but it doesn't matter, because the system is robust enough that whichever computers do keep running properly are the ones all the nodes know to believe.  The whole system has a remarkable stability.

Bitcoin doesn't distinguish between long-term savings and "loss."  That makes a certain sort of sense.  For instance, sometimes things are lost for a long, long time and then found.  Bitcoin addresses are meant to have a sense of permanence.  It's an intentional choice. 
You could write a system that works differently.  I'd be happy to try it with you.  I think it would be interesting for instance to have a system that recycles coins after a single day.  If you wanted to hold those Hot Potato Coins for long you'd need to have a bot juggle them.  But then you'd lose them if your bot went down, so maybe run two or three or a thousand bots all watching your coins to juggle them.  I think it'd be worth trying just to see what happens. :)

It's not that everything else stays the same while a few people become rich from holding bitcoin.  Some people become rich from bitcoin while others are also becoming rich from their holdings in unusual hats or magic weapons.  A young child could go viral for having suddenly become a billionaire by being an early adopter of an unexpectedly popular game where you collect cute cats.  People will be trading "virtual" real estate (with real solid connections to and affects on real physical and social realities) for massive amounts of money.  Meanwhile, a "small amount" of this future money that's in some bizarre sense "equivalent" to today's quarter or millibit will buy you a starter set of nanobots to build the anything of your dreams out of anything else you have lying around.

Yes but you accept full personal liability for everything.  In other words: Yes, when you are completely successful and untarnished and well-loved by everyone all they will do is take a bunch of your profits.  If anything ever goes wrong, you're fucked-- why didn't you incorporate, huh?  And you don't have any insurance (they don't insure random individuals for millions of dollars, or certainly not for any even vaguely reasonable price) so you're actually on the hook for the medical costs for life of the person who slipped on your wet floor or whatever, unless you're able to hire a good enough lawyer to shrug off the suit (which is also for most people an unsustainable expense). 
They don't just instantly take down everyone who starts to do anything interesting or profitable.  That would look bad and would also be bad tactics-- attacking people at their *strongest* point.  The system is to just randomly take people down whenever they seem *weak*.  There's some chaos around the edges and things slip through the cracks but on the whole that's a very efficient cost-effective way to maintain order. 
That's what was supposed to happen to Bitcoin.  They didn't think they had to pay close attention to it, to engage-- they thought the *costs* of engaging would be more than the rewards, as they often are-- after all, in D.C.ese it's called "punching down" if you make the terrible mistake of picking a fight with someone who ought not to be considered your equal and accidentally elevate them.  They just took seemingly random disengaged swipes at Bitcoin related stuff whenever it was weak; they kicked us when we were down.  If there really was a The Bitcoin Company or anything at all centralized and legally liable from any angle, this strategy would have long since succeeded in destroying us.

It's not where *I* draw the line, it's not arbitrary and I'm not pulling it out of my ass, this is an important and well-known concept in political/economic theory that everyone ought to be familiar with.  The "Means of Production" doesn't refer simply to the ability to make or do anything, what it refers to is particularly those parts of the physical inputs available to society which are *fundamental*, the inputs upon which all of the production of society is based.  You could think of it as the materials necessary to *reconstitute* society were all else destroyed. 
Suppose that you control all of the means of production, you control *everything* that can be used to produce more wealth, such as arable land and factories that can make things (even machines to set up more factories).  It doesn't matter what else I have control of, if you have control of all of those things.  I need you, but you don't need me.  No matter what I offer you in exchange for some land or some machines to start my own factory, it's not rational for you to accept my offer-- you can extract from me *anything* that I have or can produce, simply by not offering to trade me the food or other essentials of life that you exclusively control for anything else, an offer that I cannot refuse. 
Ownership of any particular thing that allows you to produce something does not constitute ownership of the means of production, even if the thing you own allows you to produce something essential to society.  As long as someone else also owns some of the means of production such that society can be reproduced without your help, that's just fine.  The *only* problem is if an individual or group owns *all* of the means of production.  Then that individual or group *completely* controls society.  You don't have to take *everything* away from them to solve that problem, you just need to take enough away that someone else can begin to produce essential things again and you're free from them. 
The real problem is that gaining complete control of the means of production is easier than it looks.  Once you have control of *most* of the means of production, for instance, it's not hard to use that *almost* complete control of everything in society to demand control over the last few holdouts.  And actually it turns out that even when you start with a perfectly level playing field at first, very soon just randomly some party will get just *slightly* more resource control, which puts them at a *slight* competitive advantage, which very quickly develops into feedback patterns that create enormous concentrations of wealth. 
The only way to avoid this disaster is to have enough resources to reconstitute the basic wealth of society owned in such a way that they can't be sold off.  For instance you could have enough of the land in each community owned by a community trust where decisions about how to use it include everyone equally.  It's OK if individuals or groups or classes can take ownership of various things, as long as no one's able to take *exclusive* ownership of the community's entire collection of any of the small selection of things (land, weapons, etc.) where exclusive ownership of them is equivalent to control of society.  That's all.  Common sense really.

It's just that communities should decide for themselves what happens there.  Everyone affected by what happens at any particular point on Earth should have a say in what happens there, proportional to how much they're affected.  Common sense, really.  The alternative is that particular parts of the Earth are considered transferable property, which results in all kinds of absurdities.  As long as everyone has basic access to the shared inheritance of Earth, everyone's rich and there's no way to oppress anyone because they can draw on the commonwealth to defend themselves.  If someone can be denied access to *anything and everything on Earth* because *all* of it is "owned" by particular agents, then they are of course nothing but a slave.

Actually the walls you're hitting are around fiat currency; they're put there (openly and explicitly) by the governments to control people.  Bitcoin is *very* easy to buy if what you already have is litecoins, for instance, or *any* other uncontrolled digital currency or asset.  Even though fiat currencies are also digital assets and it would be easy as pie for those controlling them to allow them to be converted to bitcoins, they are intentionally making it difficult because they would lose that fight bad and quick because all of their currencies are completely worthless. 
There are no controls on Bitcoin at all and it's incredibly easy to transfer or acquire.  Try selling something to someone for bitcoin-- that is, something that (unlike fiat currency) you are actually able to deliver. :)

But we can make a full interface to fiat just by exchanging fiat for cryptocurrency locally in each place.  It's totally severable from the money transmission or storage or payment aspects.  People don't even need to interact with any kind of business or strangers, you can just exchange with just a few friends and it creates a local interface so anyone can get fiat in or out.  The only inefficiency in that system is that it's most suited for practical day to day use and won't necessarily have the bandwidth for whatever giant speculative investments or laundering people want to do-- but that's also rather a feature!?  On the whole I think I prefer a person to person human network better and except perhaps for the lack of a clear price signal (but can we really trust this one anyway?!) I think we'd be best off if all the bank connected exchanges collapsed entirely forever.

I'll answer your question even though you know: Poor people get internet access through friends and relatives, open wifi, libraries, etc.  And the shittiness of the credit agreements available to people, yeah, that's pretty much what I was saying also.  They might make you fill out a slip of paper to use the internet at the library but it's nothing like the hell of trying to get a credit card.  You put up with bullshit to get an awful agreement on a card and then if you do everything perfect you'll continue to earn the privilege of getting to donate-- only to *authorized* causes, of course.  Whereas no one can be denied access to Bitcoin for any reason, so you don't have to go through the effort and expense of walking on their eggshells.  Bitcoin is awesome for poor people, much worth the trouble of gleaning some internet. :)

Hmm well I'm not saying it's not possible to make a more anonymous system than Bitcoin but it's certainly not easy.  To know that an account can fund a transaction, you have to have access to at least the whole chain of transactions back to when the blocks were made, right?  Anyway it's not like you can't make less public systems, go for it, it's just that it's harder to *trust* a less public system, probably, unless you figure out a trick no one else has yet. ;)
I actually think there's a lot of room for more secretive private systems.  If they're not seeking public verification they don't need to broadcast messages at all, of course.  They'd have less transaction security but they could have other benefits. 
For instance I think it would make sense if we all set up decentralized currency exchange bots that offer to exchange one cryptocoin for another.  Like I have a few BTC and a few LTC, so I could set up a bot that's willing to trade either way and point you to it.  You'd need to trust that the bot would pay you after you paid it (or the bot would need to trust you, I suppose), and you'd need to trust me if I said the bot was dumping its logs and forgetting who traded what when, but since the system could be very very decentralized maybe you could find people you could trust.  Or I guess since anonymity adds up over each transaction, maybe you could go through enough agents to trust that at least *one* of them is properly anonymizing.. hmm. 
Bitcoin is also medium agnostic and coins can be mixed through real space. :O  It's easy to sit there and think that they're trackable but I'd hate to be the one assigned the job of trying to actually do it. :O
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:35:28
Sorta, but it's not "wallets" that are associated with actions it's "addresses."  A wallet contains many addresses, is the lingo.  Addresses are free and disposable.  A new one is generally created for every transaction (unless you want to reuse one, for instance in order to intentionally be more transparent).  So what you see on the chain is just: Exchange X deposits to Address A, which the exchange (and not necessarily anyone else) knows belongs to you.  Address A then transfers everything to Address B.  Address B then transfers everything to Address C.  Address C transfers some to Address D, and some to Address E.  Address E sends some to a *one-time disposable address* created by a seedbox company (which as a privacy conscious company it promises to then immediately forget about) and some to Address F.  There's no clues left about which of these are the same wallets or the same people.  It could be that the transfer from B to C was you spending all of it to buy something from someone else, so the coin was already out of your hands by the time it took its next steps.  It could be that the transfer from B to C was a send to a mixer, and the seedbox purchase is someone else's purchase that's been mixed with yours while the coins you control popped out unpredictably somewhere else on the network.  It could be (these days likely it is) that the send from B to C is a send to some sort of exchange, such that the transactions after it are those of the person who bought the coins from you, and your transactions are over on the Litecoin network or whatever you bought.  *Everyone's* transactions in Bitcoin (and every other currency) are spent next on nefarious illegal activities all the time, so that itself doesn't tell you anything.

It's not the ownership of land itself that's the problem.  It's the ownership of *all* of the land.  If somehow society is arranged so that everyone owns enough land to support themselves, then that's not a problem.  If there's some private land ownership, but also enough of a commons for everyone who doesn't own any land to support themselves, then the land owners don't necessarily have control over the dispossessed.  The problem is if there's someone who doesn't own any land, and can't access any commons, and the people who do own all of the land use their ownership to deny that person the essentials of life (all of which come from the land).  It's not really a problem with the ownership of the land so much as with the power structure that emerges from that ownership when it becomes total. 
Similarly, owning a computer is no problem at all, as long as everyone else is also allowed to have one.  But it would not be OK if there were a group of people who were confiscating everyone else's computers, such that *only* they had computers, and then using their control of computing to control society.

Yes they have, yes but some of them are alive, Litecoin is accepted by more than 25 merchants.  And actively developed.  Merchants can automatically have payments converted between cryptocurrencies (or even fiat, as long as that's allowed).  The more successful alt coins have substantial pools or are merge mined or both so good luck trying to break them.  Litecoin had an unquestionably fair start and is broadly held, as are almost all alt coins (even most of the scamcoins, since the scammers have already mostly sold out).  There's no network effect that eliminates the value of alt coins, as it's easy to accept more than one kind of coin.  Bitcoin will continue to be one of the most highly valued coins but not for any technical reason, mostly just because of thoughtless boosters like yourself. 
Holding multiple cryptocurrencies isn't of course as diverse as having a variety of assets of different classes.  It is of course more diverse and stable within this asset class.  You're wrong.

I think it's awesome!  But there's no reason the value of a bitcoin should go all the way to a million USD (unless we're talking about a crash of the USD, which isn't unlikely, but that's neither here nor there).  Other currencies and assets will pick up an increasing share over time of the value flowing into the net.  The fact that million dollar bitcoins would make speculators absurdly rich is a sign that there would be an inefficiency there, that the system would be extracting a tax rather than just fairly transferring value.  The fairest cryptocurrencies will win in the long term, and Bitcoin will only get as much ahead as it can bluff its way through on its brand awareness.

No not at all.  There's no inherent force in one ownership relation or another, force is in their consequences.

You're welcome, no problem.  Hmm, what should you try next.  Well, what would you like to accomplish with cryptocurrency?  It's just a basic technology.  I think it's a good foundation to build things on.  What I'm using it for is a species of evolving program I'm working on. 
You could think of something you'd like to sell and offer it, either a service somewhere like or a physical good somewhere like Bitmit.  Or you could just think about what in your normal expenses could be switched to Bitcoin, like I've started using Namecheap for my DNS services and I've been really happy with them so far.  
You could also learn about other cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin.  It's just the main one not the only one.  I think a lot of other coins have some potential.  The main alternative is Litecoin.  The Litecoin desktop client looks and works almost the same as the Bitcoin one, so it's easy enough to figure out.  Since it's not as popular the blockchain downloads way faster so that's a plus. ;)  If you PM me a Litecoin address I'll send you a couple of them. :)

But even ancaps do not believe that *all* resources should be owned by individuals; they almost all allow for the formation of voluntary associations capable of collective ownership.  The Anarchist position is simply that resources should be managed directly by those who are affected by their use, with everyone fairly empowered to contribute to all decisions in proportion to how much they are affected by them.

You wouldn't lose all your bicoins if you lost your phone, if you have it arranged properly.  The person who stole your phone wouldn't be able to transfer anything out of your account if it has a passphrase guarding it, and meanwhile you should have a copy of the keys at home or in the cloud which you can use from a different computer to move the coins to safety. 
Anyway, a phone wallet is just a way to make it convenient to carry some coin around and quickly spend it.  You don't have to put all of your savings there, just like you don't put all of your fiat at once into a physical fiat wallet.  Just put as much on your phone as you're planning to spend or willing to lose. 
I don't have a smartphone yet but I'm planning to get one soon and when I do I'll certainly install a Bitcoin client on it and keep a little bit of coin there.  It's a very convenient way to make payments at storefront retail stores or to friends in person.

Yes but you don't trust anyone in particular at the institution to hold your money.  The reason those institutions are trustworthy is that they *allow* you to "Trust No One" because they guarantee that even if every person at the institution is simultaneously trying to steal the money, the system they all follow together will prevent them from doing so or will pay you back.  Generally that is not simple and the fee for holding your money is quite high (though at banks it's usually hidden by inflation).

Well in a syndicalist structure for instance the government structure is also in charge of the means of production, it's identical with the unions who are identical with the owners of the factories and such that they work in.  So they can direct resources just by deciding how to direct their own collective production.  But that's probably viewed by the right wing "libertarians" here as some sort of land tax or something, or whatever they need to think to have freedom be synonymous with their power to dispose of their disproportionate personal wealth. ;)  Hey, it feels really odd to see this statist/anti-statist conversation happening with the anti-statist side represented by these people!!

It's not easy to understand.  The first response of plenty of people who knew lots about programming and cryptography and everything when it was [first introduced]( was to say "Well, that's an interesting idea, but it could never actually work."  It's kinda a surprise that it does.  It's a fundamentally new weird system that's not obvious or intuitive. 
The system imagines coins into existence.  Easy enough to write a program that imagines that people have such-and-such an amount of coins and they can transfer them around, right?  But then alas it's just as easy to copy that system and make another one that's exactly the same except you're richer or something, and then which one is the "real" one? 
So the clever part of Bitcoin is the way it tells which one is real: The real one is the one that the most computing power went into making it.  It requires these hashes that are really difficult to make and so that proves that a bunch of computers worked really hard to make that version.  Now you can still make all the alternate versions you want, but you can't put such difficult low hashes on your version proving that anyone put any work into it, so no one *cares* about your version. 
There's just one problem left, which is that you now need a *huge* amount of computing power securing the system or someone else can make a longer chain and break it.  And why are people going to wear out their computers securing this system?  Couldn't someone pay someone to run a computer breaking it, instead, and overwhelm the people charitably maintaining it?  Yup, probably they could, if there was no incentive to do things properly. 
The solution the Bitcoin system has to that is so clever that it's quite hard to believe it works at all, and we're not *really* entirely sure that it'll continue to work forever (though it's been going fine for years now): Simply pay people *inside the system* to secure that *very same system*.  Pay them in the very imaginary thing that they are themselves helping to imagine into existence.  Does that make sense?!  The network pays itself something imaginary that it makes up in exchange for making up that imaginary thing!?  Apparently it does.  Apparently it holds together pretty well.  It's a weird awesome magical thing though that takes a while to grok.

There are other possibilities.  For instance a local community could trade using paper wallets or a BTC denominated scrip.  You just need something that someone's willing to either sell or buy at a fixed BTC price that would cost more than (yet have a resale value less than) that price to counterfeit.  The usual balance of forces for a local currency, but Bitcoin also ties it directly to a world market.

Bitcoin takes over one important function of government. :)  You're on a site called Reddit where what information is important is decided (somewhat) democratically by direct vote, a service which used to be provided in many nations exclusively or almost exclusively by state news agencies. :)  Does that answer your question? :) 
The internet community is self-governing and deeply democratic and rapidly expanding. 
How about this: What aspect do you want to change *next*?  What should we take over next?  It's an embarrassment of riches.  Especially with Bitcoin as our newest lever/crowbar to keep the process rolling.

This is why I think it's a good thing that the value of a bitcoin has been going way up.  I could care less what happens to the investors who are trying to make their fortunes here, but I do care what happens to the "investors" who have forgotten tips.  Now instead of all those tips being loose change, there's plenty of money sprouting up all over Reddit-- I guess that's why they started sending out notices, because it's such an alarming amount of untended money sprouting wild.  That money is going to go places, buying things or trading for alts or sharing with your friends.  That could generate some actual economic activity that actually gets things moving.

No I'm saying anyone can make an EXACT COPY of your store, with exactly the same merchandise for lower prices.  There's a cost to them of establishing some trust that they're selling accurate data, but that cost is significantly less than your proposed cost of paying a bunch to inventors.  It's the same store with the same interface to the same products but it costs a penny instead of a dollar!!  Here's a sensible pricing scheme for instance: If you're the first person to buy the data, you deposit the full $1 and your $1 is used to buy the data from the "legitimate" expensive site, then for subsequent buyers the price is $0.01 but it goes back to you until you've gotten back $0.99, from then on the pennies from additional buyers go to the anonymous site owner.  The only defenses against this are onerous, such as successfully watermarking the data you sell and strongly punishing leaks.  It must be military tight and you must not even have any Bradley Mannings or you lose. :)

Bitcoin is not backed by anything else, it is valuable on its own account.  Or to say the same thing differently, the main commodity which backs Bitcoin is **Bitcoin network transactions** themselves, because they can most easily be bought from miners by paying bitcoin in the automated transactions auction. 
Bitcoin is useful in multiple ways, but in my opinion its greatest intrinsic value is as a distributed secure ledger of accounts.  Here's one commodity that backs Bitcoin, and why it's dramatically underpriced: **Colored coins**.  Bitcoins will soon be used to securely account for *anything*, not just who has generic bitcoins.  The Bitcoin network can therefore be used to build systems which can replace *more* sections of the economy in addition to currency, such as also stocks and commodity futures and trading smart property. 
However that is just one of the many valuable properties of bitcoins.  (It is as if you asked early in the Internet's history, "what value is there to an Internet?"  Well, *many* things, really!)  Bitcoins are also useful for instance as a flood control tool, a way to prevent spamming and DDoSing and other unpleasant uses of network resources.  It may not be evident at first but this property is what makes it possible at all that we are now providing one another secure anonymous VPNs, web hosting, etc.-- we *could not* do so, no matter how generous we were, if we could not put a cost on it guaranteed to rate limit abusers.

Worried?  No I think I would be awesome if cryptocurrencies somehow had a shelf life.  Then we wouldn't have any danger of all the value getting stuck in one place, it'd always have to move to the best of the new systems as the older systems aged.  But that doesn't seem to be how it works at all, alas.  I'm using a junky old laptop and starting it up as a Bitcoin node is a *little* more difficult than starting up Litecoin, but not really *enough* more difficult.  And the transaction set grows linearly while memory and processing (apparently, for the foreseeable future) grow exponentially.  Oh well.  I think new chains can still compete by being nimble in other ways.

What is theft?  What is truth?  If we trust someone to make us one factor physical coins then we have set up a system where either we or (possibly) they can move the coins.  If we have someone make us multifactor physical coins then we've set it up so they can't take the coins at all.  The system is supposed to detect somehow that we didn't mean it in the first case when we gave someone (potential) control over the coins?  How?  What if we *did* want to set up that set of rules, where either each person can redeem their coins separately or the issuer can redeem any of them?  What if someone sets up a system and it's *vague* which of those possibilities was the intention? 
Let's just get real and accept our responsibility to *code clearly exactly what we want to happen*.

I think what will happen next will be another cycle of manic hype.  Very soon, as soon as the media can find any hook to justify talking about it again.  They want something really dirty and messy, of course, ideally, but they'll take any hook they can get. 
Bitcoin went way up was their first hook recently.  Bitcoin crashes was a second, that worked, that's drama.  They can't really do a story now "oops, never mind, back up again"-- I mean some such stories have been written, just not a critical mass of them, because that's not a good enough hook for someone who doesn't know yet why they should care.  Bitcoin is volatile-- the public mind gets that.  Next they are going to collectively digest another tiny little chunk of information.  It's hard to say which one. 
I mean to take an obvious example, the kind of hook the media has wet dreams about, we could see one of our Anonymous characters unmasked tomorrow.  If the identify of Satoshi or even the Dread Pirate Roberts was revealed that would be front page news everywhere.  But they won't be so lucky. 
My guess (just a guess) for a hook that might get a bite soon is the Bitcoin ATMs.  It doesn't have the flavor of course of a Satoshi unmasking but it's enough to keep the presses rolling.  It was a story to *us* when they premiered at whatever Libertarian conference that was, but of course you cannot write a mainstream news headline story about *anything* that happens at some little alternative political conference, not just because it's actually consequential to history.  The same information presented in a different forum, this installation in San Diego or whatever, could be socially acceptable to talk about and thus a workable hook. 
I absolutely do not think it will just lie quietly for very long at all.  It has to be off the table now for just a moment because of unrelated qualities of cultural processing-- there's other business to be put on the table, and aesthetic reasons why it would be unseemly to immediately seem to become collectively obsessed.  Bitcoin will return to the conversation just as soon as that forced period of inattention ends, on the first hook that presents itself.

1) Governments are not there to peacefully collect some sort of payment that they earn or deserve and use for the benefit of humanity.  They are descended directly from the rule of Kings and they violently demand payments which they use for wars of conquest.  You are deeply misled and directly personally supporting things which are evil.
2) Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty of the hash required so that however much effort people are putting towards discovering hashes, blocks are still produced at a steady rate.  The Bitcoin network collectively pays a certain amount for network security, and miners compete to offer the most security they can *for that price*.  That allows the level of security to adjust based on how cheap hashing power becomes; as long as bitcoins are valuable the hashing power of the whole network will continue to be expensive to overwhelm. 
Note that the payments to construct this infrastructure are collected and distributed without violence, and that the Bitcoin network is incapable of itself fighting a war to expand its own power.  This is one of the central objectives of Bitcoin: Remove power (the power, particularly, to print money) from violent untrustworthy governments and put it instead into a fair, voluntary, collectively managed system which is far more difficult to corrupt.

Fiat currency is a really weird thing to buy with bitcoin.  It doesn't matter at all.  I think they are having some international talks about how to regulate Bitcoin since they realize now they would need a coordinated international response, but they're even more inefficient on that level than usual and they can't actually do anything at all in time to matter.  If they have a response it'll be an utterly failed attempt to put in some random regulatory hooks.  But they'll be grasping sand in their claws; they've already lost.

It's not like we're going to augment humans and then that's the only intelligences there'll be is augmented humans.  What an augmented person is like is like a *giant flock* of intelligences, with maybe some big centers but also lots of tiny semi-autonomous parts. 
For instance people are already telegraphing that they want their household robots to be pet or servant like externalized agents.  People are already accumulating flocks of web cloud agents to process information for them (which are mostly autonomous now as in controlled by giant evil senseless corporations, but still, autonomous).  People's Bitcoin miners are trading their processing autonomously on the networks, only asking their human handlers to please plug them in.  Currency trading bots are making trades on behalf of their owners-- and soon there will be autonomous ones which have not a single controlling owner but multiple supporting patrons.  Bitcoin itself is an early autonomous agent. 
So at any point (even right now) currency could stop being the metaphor for how a human relates directly to their rig, their flock, their agents.  But in the whole complex tapestry of it currency will probably be used at many points, even internally within systems owned by the same person to lubricate the interactions of their subagents, and certainly at contact points understood to be external or untrustworthy or even adversarial for as long as such uncertainties persist. 
But I mean I'm talking about the late transition I guess.  It's true we might leave currency behind when we actually hit the Singularity itself.  But really literally *all* bets are off, then. :)

The fact of the matter is that the dollar isn't stable either, which means you're also getting a random amount of value if you get a dollar payment, but since everyone's expenses are also dollar denominated it doesn't matter.  As long as everyone's playing the same game you can pretend nothing's happening.

There are already alternatives to bitcoin!  I know they're not mentioned here very often, or only mentioned with disdain, but the things wrong with them were wrong with bitcoin itself not so long ago!? 
Already the miners mine various chains depending on which is most profitable.  Bitcoin happens to be by far the most valuable, so it gets most of the hashing.  But if/when people start to give more value to a different chain, nobody even has to *do* anything for that chain to get more hash power, as there's a bunch of mining computers already autonomously watching the exchanges ready to switch networks as soon as it's worth even a penny to do so.  That situation will only get *more* fluid. 
Thus I find this notion that bitcoin will stand completely alone-- well, not absurd, but certainly in need of justification.  There are already both alternative blockchains and alternative systems like this ripple thingy that simultaneously compete with and interoperate with those blockchains.  It's already complex and I think it will get *very much more* complex-- why on earth wouldn't or shouldn't it?! 
The idea of bitcoin early adopters that bitcoin is a fully decentralized system which also will bring them personally lots of wealth because they're the ones who control it is a contradiction on its face.

Yes, they're contradictory as narratives of why Bitcoin isn't useful or isn't going to be widely used in the near future.  They're not even each internally very coherent, but also they certainly contradict each other.  If people are seeing through the volatility and refusing to spend bitcoin because their perception is that it always gradually increases in value on average then why is the volatility a problem, since everyone can see through it?  Why are they so scared of the volatility, if they also refuse to spend their bitcoin because they know it's deflationary?  How can you do both?  And incidentally how is either one a problem for Bitcoin or for anything??

It could work various ways I suppose.  The simplest way would be just to have it do one question at a time, then when it's done with one question open for business to accept a next one, and if anyone comes by when it's not ready to accept a question it'd just turn them away.  That's ever so slightly rude of course, and if the bot economy was as ridiculously efficient as it'll be soon, a flock of agents would come in then to constantly reload and see if it's available, all just to compete for the chance to grab one to resell it to a queue for a few extra satoshi-- but we're not quite there yet. ;) 
Here's what I'd think of doing: Each time a faucet gets up to a whole bitcent in its account, from donations or selling services or whatever, it makes a (mutated) copy of itself and sends it half of its satoshi.  Each time a faucet cleans out its account entirely, it also archives and deactivates itself.

Sure OK whatever.  But the question is what "the" protocol is.  "The" protocol used to allow microtransactions that some people would like to disallow.  So now we have a disagreement about which is "the" protocol to use going forward, which will have to be resolved politically.  I personally would very mildly prefer that Bitcoin make itself very uncomfortable to coin colorers, because then the coin colorers will start a new chain (it's already being discussed) and I think a diversity of chains is healthier.  But mostly I think it's fine either way, I was just pointing out it's been thrown into some mild chaos.

Most of the people here are long on BTC, so this is not a good place to get an accurate answer to that question. ;)  Bitcoin obviously isn't a safe investment but it's probably a good one.  Whether it's the right one for *you* depends on what other opportunities you have available to allocate your capital, and what type and degree of risk you're comfortable with. 
You could buy a bond or CD and get a *guaranteed* return; it would be a very low return because rates are low now but I think that's fair because it's presently a very uncertain world.  You should probably have *some* of your assets in such safe boring things, unless you're really sure you would be happy if you lost everything. :) 
If you are in any sort of debt, it would be a very good investment to pay down that debt immediately.  Paying your debt is another investment with a guaranteed rate of return (the interest you would otherwise have been paying).  If you buy BTC by going into or staying in debt, you'd better hope that you win that bet because if you lose you'll encounter very little sympathy. :P 
If you're solvent and actually willing to lose a few hundred dollars, then why not?  I suggest not thinking of it as an "investment" and hoarding it but rather just thinking of it as entering the modern age and getting some new useful electronic assets that happen to be valuable.  There's plenty of stuff to buy online and there'll probably be stuff offline soon as well.  If you spend your bitcoin wisely, you can get good deals and have some fun while helping build a genuine useful economy. 
Don't gamble. :)

On the other hand if Litecoin use does grow to be say a hundred times more than it is now, I'd think that would mean the current price is an undervaluation.  The Mt Gox thing is a sideshow, a trailing not a leading indicator.  Merchant acceptance also doesn't really mean much.  The fundamental question is just the long-term security and stability of the system.  As long as Litecoin does turn out to be a basically viable cryptocurrency at all it can easily earn this valuation.

That's cool, but it's not like signing a simple transaction is the only thing you ever want to do with cryptocurrency.  What if you have a different currency than the one you want to spend?  Someone with a secure full strong general purpose computer can just install the newest multicurrency autoconverting magic wallet, while someone with a system that's secure because it's dead because all it can do is sign a single normal Bitcoin transaction is going to have to manually initiate a transfer to an exchange, yes I'd like to transmit to the exchange, yes I'd like to sell the coins, manually withdraw the coins, manually make the purchase in the other currency.  I think a modern human being ought to be armed with strong secure general purpose computers and actually taught how to use them.  I mean yes specific purpose computers are a good security mechanism but they're like a *safe*, you can't *live your life* in a safe.

I don't think cryptocurrency as a concept is in any danger.  The main danger to the BTC market price is if for some reason it's no longer the most important coin.  There's no alternative presently in use that has any chance of supplanting it, but Litecoin and maybe a few others might be able to compete somewhat and hold the price down out of the stratosphere.  It's entirely possible though that a new coin could demolish Bitcoin; it'd just need a cheaper way to secure against the same attacks and all of the Bitcoin infrastructure would suddenly seem silly.  Bitcoin could keep its current value long-term though even then just as a novelty (wow, I own some of the very first cryptocurrency!); the current value of the network is *very* low if it does turn out to be stable and secure.

It's my intuition that in the future almost all of the monetary transactions on the internet will be between bots.  There's a lot of systems where using currency as a lubricant could make them more efficient/trustworthy.  It's even more sensible really than exchanges between humans-- bots are capable of being much more patient rational decision makers than humans, certainly when there are lots of choices differing only in arbitrary numbers.  Selling tracker ratio sounds like a sensible way for computer systems to resell bandwidth they have access to.  Also useful would be systems for renting hard drive space, memory, processing power, etc.

The person receiving the loan gets the cash (or bitcoin) that the depositor deposited.  They're the *only* one who actually gets it.  All the depositor has is a promise from the bank that they can get their money back sometime, but the bank can't actually fulfill that promise unless the person they loaned the money to (or an insurer or government or someone) gives it back to them.  So it's not the money that's loaned that's created out of thin air, that's real, the generated money is the supposed money the depositor thinks they still "have" in their bank account even though it's actually been (90%ish) emptied out and turned into just a promise from the bank.

Oh hey I grew up near Boston.  That would be great if you could get some bitcoining going in Boston so I have somewhere to spend some coin when I visit. :)  Get the Lucy Parsons Center to accept it please. :) :) 
You're in a large enough area you should just buy some coin for cash.  There's plenty of people on localbitcoins.com or even better you should just find a meetup and get in touch with the local Bitcoin folks and I'm sure they'd help you learn how to set up wallets and everything. 
DO NOT ASSUME BTC WILL GO UP IN VALUE certainly not in the short term and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  The amount you should buy is an amount low enough that if you wake up tomorrow and the price of Bitcoin is zero and the news is "unexpected completely fatal security flaw found in Bitcoin after all" you will be fine with that, because that really could happen.  Just want to get that clear. ;) 
You'll probably make a *lot* more money if instead of just investing a few bucks you start *accepting* Bitcoin yourself from local people for some product or service so you've got a flow of BTC coming in.  Then you'll effortlessly have more and more BTC savings as long as you just don't always spend/convert all your BTC income.  There are people near you who *want* to spend some bitcoins, just give them *any* reasonable value proposition and they'll take it, they want to help you and work with you to bring the Bitcoin economy to life.

Heck all we need them to do really is securely store some data, they don't even need to legally know what those keys are-- they should be encrypted against them anyway.  Locally I know there's already lots of overlap between Bitcoin enthusiasts and the people working on radicalizing the local Credit Unions, so maybe we could goad them into providing something useful.

Well of course there are people with a variety of ideas about exactly how to structure a society free of domination.  In general we accept anyone with any reasonable idea of how to make a free society as an "Anarchist" and a comrade.  An Anarchist society *has* been successfully achieved in history, for instance in Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War.  In that case it was achieved through "syndicalism," through radical unionism.  The union of the workers in each industry declared and realized direct control over that industry, directing themselves in their own activities by general union meetings, so that there was no distinct class of people who were the "government" or bosses, just (for instance) the railway workers deciding themselves how to fix the railway.  It is recorded in history that the railways and everything else in society did in fact function under those conditions.  Alas they fell to Franco; consider well whether his is the side of history you'd like to be on. ;)

That does not matter.  You can price a loan relative to any asset you believe will have a stable price, or that otherwise seems acceptable.

Why do you think that your purchases in any other economy are any less connected to illicit gains?  The property of Bitcoins that you're criticizing, the ability to make anonymous purchases, is also a feature of ordinary cash and in general of *any* society without pervasive surveillance.  I don't think you mean to be advocating universal surveillance, so I'm not sure what you're asking.  Bitcoin is not different in this respect.  Fiat, metals, ordinary items of value, none of them have this property of trackability which Bitcoin is also missing.  You can only be comparing Bitcoin to the credit card system, which is a tremendously evil system of control and monitoring unprecedented in human history, not some sort of norm for moral comparison!!

Yes, with the private key you can sign a statement saying "Hey everyone!  Send a bitcoin from this account to account such-and-such now please!" 
Right now if you sent such a message we would all ignore it, because there is no bitcoin in the account to transfer. ;)  If there in fact was a bitcoin in the account, and the signature of the message checked out as matching the public key, then we'd all consider the bitcoins transferred, and once a few different miners confirmed that transaction into the blockchain it would be permanently irreversible. 
We have no way of knowing whether the transaction is legit except that it's signed with the private key, so you have to keep the private key safe because anyone who has it can transfer the bitcoin associated with the public key to any account they want.

Ha what no worries, the other messages I get on Reddit are just ancaps arguing with me about how beneficial they think capitalism is for workers. :/ 
The algorithm used in Bitcoin is this thing SHA256.  It's a hashing algorithm, I frankly don't understand it except that it takes any input data and makes a *very unpredictable* hash from it.  So basically you change any little thing about the input data you'll get a whole different hash, there's no way to predict what hash you get for what.  So then to mine a block you have to hash a big string that's a concatenation of all the recent transactions, and the previous block's hash so they make a chain, and then there's also a random number in there that you try different values of-- it has nothing to do with anything except that changing anything changes the hash completely, so it's something for you to change-- each different try, you get a totally different result for the hash.  If the result is low enough (another way of saying the same thing is that it has to start with a bunch of zeros) then you win. 
The algorithm used for Litecoin is scrypt, and I understand it even less.  It was invented to stop people from spamming, it's like an automated captcha.  That doesn't make sense, ha!  It doesn't Tell Computers and Humans Apart, I guess what it tells apart is just computers that are trying to quickly spam vs computers that are just posting a few messages.  It just makes the computer work kinda hard at something, I forget excatly what the task is.  But part of the requirements for the task is that it requires some memory as well as processing.  It can't be computed on a Bitcoin ASIC because those just do SHA256, but it's also relatively difficult to make a Litecoin ASIC-- it'll probably happen eventually, but apparently it involves putting a bunch of memory along with the specialized processors which is apparently trickier.

A lot of people who are new to Litecoin are misinformed about it and think "woo, fast confirmations, Litecoin goes faster and so it must be at least four times better than Bitcoin" which is of course wrong.  But the Litecoin community generally doesn't have that impression and tries to inform people of the actual situation.  The word on the street is that you need *at least* four times as many Litecoin confirmations for the same amount of security as a given number of Bitcoin confirmations. 
My intuition is that 2.5 minutes is too fast.  I agree that it's not quite optimal.  But it *works fine*.  I don't think Bitcoin is optimal either, my intuition is that it's just a little too *slow*.  I feel like 7 minute confirmations would be perfect.  And that's probably not quite right either.  But whatever!?  It seems to work pretty well at a wide variety of speeds. 
What surprises me is that we've experimented with so *few* possibilities.  So *what* if most arrangements wouldn't be economically or technically viable?  Why aren't we *testing* them out and *proving* that they're not viable?  We should be running systems at all of the too fast confirmation speeds, so we have data that *shows* how they're too fast and what exactly the trade-offs are and we can make a rational choice. 
I support Litecoin just because it's *something else* that can give us a tiny amount of perspective.  Because when you say two and a half minutes is "too" fast, I can say on a pile of solid evidence that it actually is working fine.  You'd surely say that ten second confirmations are "too" fast, and I'd say maybe they are and maybe they aren't, and how are we going to know for sure unless we try it sometime?? :)  If the Fastcoins turn out in the end to be worth nothing then that would be just the value we have in fastcoins now; we would learn something important and it would cost us nothing.

This is sorta just the inverse of colored coins.  You could think of coloring a coin as "tainting" all the rest of the coins as not having that color.

The biggest downside risk is that a new cryptocurrency gains traction that is widely agreed to have properties that many people prefer over Bitcoin's properties, and in a way that the Bitcoin community is unable to change their protocol to match.  I think that actual denouement is an unlikely scenario, mostly just because everything about the situation is fluid: A threat would have to be both serious *and unrecognized* in order for the alternate system to have time to overtake completely before the political pressure on Bitcoin forces internal changes.  However I do believe that other systems will soon enter this market, with whatever mild degrees of success, and Bitcoin's value will be (minimally) constrained by that competition.

If we gave you any BTC at all just for posting this message (on this very new Reddit account) then since the cost of producing a new Reddit account and asking for bitcoin is very very very low, it would become a profitable activity to produce new Reddit accounts and ask for bitcoin, and many many people and robots who are less sincere and actual than you may happen to personally be would constantly spam us with similar messages until we gave up.

Rephrase your question as whether you should sell your fiat and the answer is obvious, sell that shit quick, they're "easing" it like it's going out of style. ;)  Especially if you're in Japan. :(  The real question is what you should take for it.  You can't really buy stocks or bonds at low quantities without losing because of the fees.  So cryptocurrency or metals are some of your best choices for holding the value.

It's not hard to buy or sell bitcoin.  They can't make it hard to buy or sell bitcoin.  It's only difficult to buy or sell *fiat* online, because that's what they are able to control.  That may seem like a distinction without a difference since what you're trying to do is change fiat for BTC, but if you step back and think about what you really what to accomplish there are a lot of other ways to go about it.  You can sell something online in exchange for bitcoin, for instance-- instead of being harder than other currencies this is *easier* because there's no such thing as a Bitcoin "merchant account" or any other hoops.  Or you could just buy bitcoin from someone in person for cash.

All government enforcement is obviously evil and always has been.  Sorry you were raised by a confused society but that's true.  It's all very sadistic and terrible. 
The reason you have to pay what the person at the deli asks when you buy your sandwich is because someone cannot buy the sandwich and then make nearly free copies of it and then resell them.  I am sure you can understand that if or when this was or will be possible that the price of a sandwich would plunge to approximately zero unless people were somehow stopped from making free sandwich copies.  And what a sad thing that would be to attempt, to bring us back to starvation just to sell a sandwich; just let people have their free sandwiches, would you? 
Your suggestion that alternative markets would be full of viruses is absurd.  Alternative markets would not need to be randomly chaotic.  Alternative markets for the data you are selling could have exactly the same data you are selling with no difference at all except lower prices.  You would just get to sell something at full price *once* and then someone else would have that data and then if it was worth anywhere near $1 really then they could resell it for $0.99 and get back most of their investment. 
What if there's a site that's not just some Pirate Bay chaos of people uploading whatever they want, what if it's just a .onion clone of *exactly* what's on your official site.  Someone-- let's call them the Dread Pirate Roberts-- uses sock accounts on your system to buy just one copy of each (sufficiently popular) design, puts them all up in a site that works exactly the same as yours with the same layout and purchasing process except it only charges $0.10.  What are you gonna do?  You can't very well tell me you'd just arrest the Dread Pirate Roberts-- he's also got some drug charges to answer for! :O  But there's a more important reason he wouldn't bother: There's also no way for him to stop someone else setting up the same shop next door to him and charging $0.05.  The economics of the situation ruthlessly demand that copies of any valuable data will be available for approximately zero, for not much more than the cost of one copy and one save.

I also think it'll be useful to homeless people and other people who find it difficult to engage with the banking system.  Bitcoin is almost exactly what they need now except that they don't necessarily have daily access to a computer on the internet, or when they do it might not be safe or their own.  Even twenty five dollars is expensive if you're on the street, but we can subsidize them and train them.  Trading bitcoin on the street could be a better employment option than canning or drug dealing, even and especially if it becomes illegal. :&gt;

Yes but that gives the lie to the story.  Government has a noble purpose but it's never accomplished it, never even a little bit.  So that makes the noble purpose not really the goal and center and meaning of the system as much as just part of the story of the system, part of the trappings. 
There's plenty of other ideas about how to organize human society.  There's no reason at all to keep doing something that's never succeeded and that has continually actively failed for hundreds or thousands of years.  It is well past time to consider whether that strategy is just fundamentally *wrong*.

I was already using Linux, but Bitcoin did cause me to change my security practices in numerous ways.  Ways that I really should have all along.  It's not that Bitcoin was the first thing that was important or valuable on the internet, it's just psychologically somehow what's snapping us out of our false sense of security we'd fallen into. 
We were just being soothed to sleep by these big corporations because *they* were getting all the value of everything we did on the net.  It wasn't that nothing we did had value, just that we had no control over the value we made.  Some big internet company would sue some other internet company for millions of dollars and none of us felt involved at all because it wasn't *our* money because they had *already* stolen all the value from us and they were just arguing about how to split the spoils so who cares.  Now something on the internet matters because for the first time there's something the rest of us get to keep.  Maybe that's why now it's snapping.

Get back here with my goal posts.  You said it wasn't possible for Anarchists to coordinate more than one community.  I responded in good faith to that argument.  Please admit that you were wrong.  Anarchists can and have coordinated large scale actions between multiple Anarchist communities, haven't they?  You were wrong about that.  *Now* we can have *another* conversation about whether Anarchists can organize particular large scale modern activities.  They can, of course.  I'll be happy to have that discussion, right after you admit that you were flatly wrong about Anarchists being able to organize large scale activities generally.  You said several times that Anarchists couldn't organize anything larger than a "small community" and made me spend actual time from my life writing up arguments against that absurd thesis.  Please either stand by that thesis and defend it, or else simply admit that Anarchists can and do and have organized large scale activities with many thousands of people and we can go from there.

So paper wallets don't work well as currency.  I think we knew that.  Too bad they don't though, eh? :(  That'd be awesome.  You could print out your own paper money with whatever designs and people could scan it and know it's real.  But it doesn't work that way.  I dunno, I keep having this weird intuition that it could and probably will work in a marginal way, where people will take paper wallets as cash but only from people they trust, they'll be like "OK IDK if I should take that from you, buddy, did you print that yourself or where is that from," it'll be weird.

I've no clue at all about the legal ramifications in Egypt.  I have no clue even what's legal here in the US.  I feel like even if I could afford to talk to a lawyer about it, they probably wouldn't be able to wrap their head around it either.  I think it could really go different ways.

Strange.  And then whenever someone magically speaks bitcoin across country borders on reddit it will magically transform into currency or commodities or unregulated meaningless numbers or forbidden cryptoterrorist weaponry or whatever. 
At the moment bitcoin is drifting towards mainstream acceptance, and nobody's doing anything to stop it, but then nobody's really noticed or taken it seriously, either.  It's potentially threatening to lots of powerful people so there's no solid reason to think that won't change.  I guess living in a cyberpunk dystopia keeps you on your toes!?

Everyone's going for bills but I think coins is cooler.  For instance a coin accepting BTC ATM could be useful for people who make their living selling or begging for change; it could be a much more accessible form of banking.  And now when Bitcoin is still less known it would be awesome if people could try it for just a quarter. 
Incidentally the UI everyone's using is terrible, that's not how I'd have it work at all.  You have to confirm every step for some reason, like "yes, I would still like to be using this ATM, thank you."  Have the camera just always watch for QR codes, and if it sees a QR code for a Bitcoin address then that becomes its new send address.  You put some coins in the slot, and now those coins are going to that address.  Bam, done.  Doesn't need any buttons at all, it could just send when it sees the next address or after not getting coins for a while, but maybe a big "send" button would help people feel finished. :)

I believe I heard somewhere the way the Winklevii are storing their cold coins is a 2-of-3 shared key distributed to safes at three different banks.  This can only be foiled by a conspiracy of multiple banks to break into their boxes, or robberies of multiple banks simultaneously, at which point they'd probably just find there's also a missing passphrase factor.  Anyone else can secure their coins in this fashion-- it doesn't have to be banks, you could keep one in your closet, one with your best friend, one with your mom.  It's really mostly just that no one bothers because if you're not actually storing a million dollars arranging all that seems like rather a lot of work.

I'm an anarchist but I'm an actual regular traditional (that is, socialist) anarchist, so I have no particular interest in evading taxes because meh-- I mean, reorganizing society requires actually *organizing* people to change structures, whether a few pseudoanarchists pay their taxes or not is an irrelevant self-indulgent detail. 
On the other hand, trying to comprehend how to file tax forms that accurately reflect the structures I am intending to create using cryptocurrency is-- mindwrenching.  I'm working for starters on evolving a set of processes that use a variety of cryptocurrencies to lubricate emergent social structures.  These will involve numerous microtransactions which are not necessarily confined to coherent old fashioned categories like "sales" or "loans" or "gifts" or whatever-- they're chaotic complicated patterns of flow that evolve to seem advantageous or sensible somehow to their human participants in whatever new ways, ways that can emerge organically without being comprehended by any of the participants. 
And that's just to start.  I also imagine creating autonomous computer systems, systems which pay for their own server space etc., and which at some point could entirely leave my control and the control of all humans.  I do not know if I would have some sort of tax liability for the actions of these autonomous systems or perhaps if I would be responsible for teaching them to pay their own taxes!?

Allowing any hint of such private profit from public wealth is a deeply corrupting force that inevitably leads to disaster.

There's also µBTC which is like a dollar if a satoshi is a cent, the ends of prices then have a dot and two digits nice and pretty, so that could make sense, but who's going to learn to type µ. ;)  Actually people just write "uBTC" sometimes, but µ is prettier. :)

It's not even an idea, it's just the absence of an idea.

Mostly I want more BTC so I can feed it to this family of processes I'm evolving.  They're combined human/computer reproducing processes, basically they're programs that by the time you're done running them you have more than one of them!  An interesting class of system.  Cryptocurrency helps lubricate them, it helps them motivate their humans, it helps them feel fair. 
I also think cryptocurrency will form the basis for many new forms of computer-to-computer autonomous interaction, that it'll allow us to finally activate and integrate all our computer systems and make things work well.  But I'm working on that less because my processes are cuter. 
All of your ideas of how to use Bitcoin sorta seem to me like you're thinking of it as a currency.  I mean, it is, sure, it was built to be one.  It's kinda similar to that old system there used to be.  But it's also just a totally new system where new things are possible.  I'm not "switching" to giving people reddit tips from running over to their houses all around the world and handing them quarters.  We're not going to "switch" to having our computers rent out processing for BTC from the annoyance of constantly having people bringing us pennies in exchange for moments of our computing power.  These things weren't even vaguely possible; *hardly anything* was possible.

No, it doesn't give control to miners (except that it gives them money, with which they can buy control of anything on the market).  Everyone has control of what they want their computer to do.  Lots of people choose to follow the Bitcoin chain and to pay miners on that chain because it makes economic sense.  Other people choose Terracoin, for whatever reason, and no one stops them.  Miners can't change anything about the system without a consensus (or they would immediately increase the mining payout, for one thing). 
I agree it's a bad thing for the world that professional miners are being rewarded.  Unfortunately it was necessary to develop and pay for that level of security in order to be able to have any currency of our own at all under this severe government repression.  We tried cheaper systems and they were crushed.  If you have a idea for a system that gives people more of a "fair chance" I'm all ears.

Yes but the question is how we decide which art projects and hobbies and jobs and collective actions get SPACE, get somewhere to exist.  Given a space to put it you could of course build any institution, couldn't you??  Any of us could.  You could start by using the space to put up a sign asking for donations for the next phase, or do something else with the space to make money for a while until turning it into what you want.  Deciding WHAT EACH SPACE BECOMES is the only thing that matters in determining what society is, what people can or have to do with their lives.  The question isn't whether there will be markets.  The question is whether markets will determine what gets space.  If the market decides, we get corporations, takeovers, landlords, evictions, foreclosures, death, wage slavery.  If the people who live in an area get to decide what's put there, then we get equality and justice and meaningful freedom, the freedom to have the space to do what you want.

I think I understand it fine.  If holding something gives you a return of 5% it's not that you're "incentivized *not* to invest" it's that you're incentivized 5% to invest in that thing.  You might not invest in *other* things if they are not as good of an investment.  Of course in reality if it's obvious to everyone that something is going to increase in value 5% they won't just let it slowly predictably increase in value, they'll buy it as soon as they know that, so I have no idea how this scenario could ever even hypothetically occur.  It's just like: "If something always predictably gave a 5% return no matter how much was invested, no other investments with returns less than 5% would attract any capital!"-- um yes, but also that's obviously impossible, and also WTF does it have to do with Bitcoin, or anything, why are we discussing weird obviously impossible hypotheticals?

No, you can accept payments in person with zero confirmations.  Or at least, there has *never* been even a single in-person double-spend even attempted.  It's a much more difficult thing to do than to counterfeit a dollar bill.  You might sometimes want to wait for confirmations with online purchases from someone anonymous-- it's still really really difficult to double-spend even in that circumstance, but at least then you could get away with trying lots of times, which could sometimes make it possible.

Probably but the real world is different than libertarian fantasy land and the existence of insurance is just a bureaucratic mess that rarely helps with situations and never magically defends you against them as they like to pretend.  Indeed, the only way in practice to get insurance companies to ever pay anything is to have the government force them, so I see very little verisimilitude to this idea that in the libertarian utopia they'd always pay out and be helpful.  Maybe you're also supposed to have some sort of insurance insurance that goes and breaks your insurance company's legs if they don't keep to their contracts.  Whatever. :P

Here's one nice way to look at it: Once you've jumped through those hoops and you're able to turn pounds into coin, you can then start turning them around and selling them locally for cash.  You only need a few local people on the exchanges in order to fuel a local market (especially if there's trades going both ways).  And then that same annoying barrier will become a reason people should come to you and pay a small premium to buy coins with cash instead of bothering to make their own exchange accounts, in other words it'll be a barrier to entry for anyone who wants to compete with you. :)

Sure: It hit the all time high.  Which makes sense as a place to sell some if you've got a bunch, no??  But then, back anywhere near $30 is also a good place to buy, if you don't think it's crashing.  So it's not the same people having wildly varying ideas of the valuation of bitcoin over the course of the day, it's a mix of some people selling and other people buying plus a few day traders trying to profit from the confusion. ;)

OK you're right I was wrong about that!  I don't see what difference it makes in this conversation though who started it.  All the capitalist countries tacked on welfare as a little afterthought when it was necessary to compete with Communism for the public's affection.  It wasn't really anybody's plan, it was just a forced move.  It's kinda freaky really how the welfare programs are turned up just enough to calm people but never enough to actually make things pleasant or free anyone from anything.

You think that simply holding a cryptocurrency is an action or effort deserving of rewards?  That doesn't make sense on the face of it.  Whatever small effort you do put in certainly doesn't vary in proportion to the amount of your holdings.  So there is no way that rewarding you for that on a per-coin basis is even vaguely rational.  If you want fair reward you should make an effort that benefits other people.  If you find yourself in a system which actually is rewarding for doing nothing you should really consider seriously what external risks there might be and whether what you are doing is moral.

Hi! 
What I'm making is a species of evolving processes that use cryptocurrency as a sort of lubricant.  Without cryptocurrency in them they were sort of clunky and could only explore fitness spaces more haltingly.  I realized it was sort of like setting up barter, because various participants get benefits from the process but only directly, so it has to always satisfy everyone in ways that seem fair.  I'm hoping currency will allow them to explore a wider variety of shapes. 
What are you working on?  What do you think we should make cryptocurrency into next? :) 
You might find that places like are better for discussing the pattern generally.  It's perhaps unfair to be upset with this sub for being particularly obsessed with the fate and price of BTC, seeing as that is its subject. ;)

It's *far* too fucking late now.  They'd have to repeat the same awareness campaign we're doing with all the tipping and everything, but to inform everyone to like rewind their minds and forget that Bitcoin's possible.  All the zillions of people all over the world who are saying "wow, my first tip, I'm trying out Bitcoin" would have to all somehow get the word that it's time to *stop* believing in Bitcoin and go back to paying for things with little metal tokens and magnets and reciting sixteen digit numbers out loud. 
And they couldn't actually make it totally *disappear*, at best it could be taboo on some surface level while it continues to gain popularity in the underground economy.  So it would have to be this continual thing of "keep not paying attention to Bitcoin, even though it's still everywhere, because it's *illegal* now."  I find it really unimaginable.  At this point it would help more than hurt, just from the exposure!  And then next it'll get even more useless.  So there's no point at which it could work for them. 
They have no blueprint for making things like this just disappear.  That's never happened.  They can make Liberty Reserve disappear, because they can take over those centralized information channels and use them to inform their customers to stop believing in them.  I think that's their *one card* they're holding that they can try to play against Bitcoin.  They can try to seize The Bitcoin Company.  When that fails or they realize it's impossible I think we should expect, bizarrely enough, their full and immediate surrender.

They loan out your money, profit on it, and then give you back *less than that profit*.  What do *you* call the amount that they give you less than they earn from your money, the amount that they charge you for storing and investing it?  I would call it a fee.

Don't put any money into Bitcoin that you can't afford to use, it's an experimental technology with numerous risks.  Bitcoins are great because they can be transferred pretty much instantly pretty much for free to any agent in the universe.  One offline sales model that I think would make sense is for people to place an order online that's ready for them when they get to the location; you can also just accept zero confirmation transactions, which is still way less risk/cost than taking credit cards.  Mt Gox is down to 60-70% of trades and falling but there's network effects that tend to concentrate that industry so they'll maintain a large chunk which doesn't really matter because it's just an interface with fiat.  There's lots of stuff you can buy with Bitcoin and it's changing fast.  You can get involved or not, whatever, there's lots of cool stuff going on in the world.  If you like cryptocurrencies you could also check out Litecoin.  Other forms of smart property will be more interesting in some ways, this is just a basic foundation.

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:24:05
You have a Bitcoin wallet.  It is on that piece of paper.  Strange but true!!  Welcome to the future, I guess!? :O  You don't need a computer to store BTC, you can store it on a piece of paper or on a ring around your finger or in your mind.  What you're storing is really just a *secret*, and the secret can be anything at all. 
When you need a computer is when you want to prove to the whole Bitcoin network that you know that secret.  You need the computer to do a bunch of devilishly tricky math to the secret, such that you can *prove* you have the secret without *revealing* the secret.  The computer is necessary not because the BTC is in any way inside it, the computer is necessary just because this is way way too much arithmetic for you to do it by pen and paper. 
You tell the computer the secret somehow-- type it in, if it's a phrase, scan it from a QR code, put in a USB key where the secret is stored, whatever-- and tell the computer to do the math that makes a Bitcoin transaction from that secret.  Then you need internet access so you can transmit that transaction to the network.  Everyone in the network can tell that the transaction is good, because it matches your public address, even though they can't reverse the tricky math you did and figure out your secret itself just from the transaction.  A miner then puts the transaction into a block and finds a difficult hash of it and it becomes part of the permanent record of all Bitcoin transactions. 
What the miner puts into the Bitcoin ledger is a note saying: These BTC have officially been moved to address such-and-such.  That next address the coins go to is associated with another secret.  If you know that secret too, you can use that next secret to make another transaction and move the BTC again.  If someone else knows the secret, they can move it.  If no one knows the secret, it is lost forever.  IF NO ONE KNOWS THE SECRET IT IS LOST FOREVER.  Careful. :) 
At the moment, unless the ATM kept a copy of your secret (which they're not supposed to do), the only copy of your secret in the universe is in the pattern of that QR code.  You can do that tricky math on that pattern and thus prove to the network that you have the right to move those coins.  You can then direct them anywhere, to any public address, to one you create yourself or to someone else's or to no one.  You have complete power and responsibility.

But is that allowed??  It's a weird situation.  It's too easy to be a bank.  It's like how a few years back it suddenly got to be way too easy to be an illegal publisher.  And they had all these crazy punishments on the books for being an illegal distributor of copyright material, which used to actually like be a thing you had to go out of your way to do it and it was really profitable, so they felt reasonable putting like a $100,000 fine per infraction or whatever.  But then you're getting that fine for just copying and pasting something.  And now we're at the same situation in financial matters.  Storing demand deposits supposedly makes you a bank with millions of dollars worth of responsibilities and all kinds of shit to comply with and don't you dare do it on pain of whatever-- and it's also now just a simple little piece of code.

This series keeps making me cringe.  But it is an interesting investigation.  Here's one thing it taught me: We could be a *lot* more aggressive about getting merchants into the Bitcoin economy.  This reporter is the *only* person running around town going into places asking if they take Bitcoin and then actually *leaving* without completing a sale if they don't.  If even just a few weirdos were to commit long-term to only spending BTC, it would create a lot more pressure than even thousands of people doing it a bit for fun.  I've been working on getting my favorite local grocer to accept Bitcoin, but I've been presenting it to him at a very patient pace and still buying things from him in fiat-- I'd throw myself into it a little harder if I felt I had to convince him before I got to eat! ;)

@_date: 2013-04-16 00:29:20
If you think about it you'll realize that there's no way for the Bitcoin network to tell coins that are intentionally saved for many years with ones that are lost.  Often coins are "lost" for a long time but then a copy of the key is found somewhere and they're unlost. :) 
At the moment it's a rather harsh, bare-metal system.  One thing you can do about it is instead of just storing private keys directly, you can break them apart into pieces with algorithms like Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.  You can decide how many of the pieces are necessary to recover the secret.  Then instead of these numbers where if you either accidentally reveal them or lose them all is lost, you have numbers where you can lose or reveal several of them and everything's fine. 
Like if you set it up so you need five of seven keys, you can accidentally completely lose two of the keys, accidentally reveal two more, and still be able to assemble what you've got left and recover the key.  But then instead of the one problem of where to hide your key, you've got *seven* problems. :/  It's complicated and bizarre and will require new habits and traditions as well as technical changes.  But it does have a nice Elven Rings of Power flavor to it. :D

Having a computational cost is the entire point of the system, not a weakness.  Orphaned blocks is perhaps annoying to miners but doesn't affect people's use of the system.  People *like* using Litecoin and getting confirmations quickly (even if rationally it doesn't provide any more security).  Obviously whether it's "too" short is a matter of whether you'd rather have faster confirmations or fewer orphans, and both Bitcoin and Litecoin are somewhat reasonable options on that spectrum.  Litecoin is currently immune to Bitcoin ASICs; it will of course have its own ASICs soon but that's hardly a sign that it's a weak system. 
That's really your whole argument that it's a "novelty" though?  Based on that evidence you assert not just that you personally slightly dislike it but that it's really not a system on which it is *possible* to securely make trades?  Come on, you don't really think Litecoin is going to be subject to "topography attacks" do you??  You just own Bitcoin and not Litecoin and you wish it weren't a viable competitor, eh?? :P

Well the problem is that the bot does a blockchain transfer with every tip so there's a fixed cost of a few cents.  I think we should make other bots with other models.  Like you could have a special "just my two cents" bot.  I think the way it should work is that if you've signed up for the bot then if you say any sort of phrase like "just my $0.02" it just quietly sends a two cent tip to the person you're responding to. :D  Then you could give your two cents to someone else (and the passing on would make more sense than with bitcointip since there's no fee diminishing it each pass, but exchange rate fluctuation would be a problem hmm) or you'd have to gather a few 2 centses before it would be worth cashing out-- maybe it could just cash you out by sending a message to the bitcointipbot saying to tip you the BTC you're due. :O

Cloning the whole system is actually rather difficult, because the Bitcoin network is the most powerful supercomputer in the world.  Most clones aren't valued by anyone or accepted on any exchanges because they don't attract enough hashrate to be secure systems.

The Bitcoin network itself couldn't really provide any sort of escrow services, no, because it has very limited access to information about the world.  It's just a base protocol though and it's easy to build on top of it.  Escrow has existed the entire time there's been a crypto economy.  It's simply *voluntary*.

No, identifying a link in a chain of transactions at one point in history proves almost nothing about the rest of the transactions connected to it.  You don't have to stay away from bitcoins that have touched exchanges in order to not be identified-- many of the bitcoins have touched exchanges and being loosely associated with a bitcoin that's touched an exchange means absolutely nothing. 
If you *could* perfectly read the history of a bitcoin and unmask the meaning of all of the transactions it *still* wouldn't let you know who was who and what the fuck actually happened.  It would just read like: Went into an exchange, left the exchange, went into a different exchange, left that exchange, went into a mixer, went into a different mixer, was bitcoin tipped, went into a different exchange, was donated to a charity, went into a different exchange, was gambled, was lost, was exchanged, was gifted, bought electronics at Bitcoinstore, went into a different exchange, went into a different mixer, was tumbled, went through the Silk Road, was sold on the street, bought an orange from a fruit stand, paid for a taxi, went through another mixer and another exchange, and then got burnt onto a paper wallet and given to a child as their inheritance.  And what you're telling me is that when that kid eventually grows up and breaks open that wallet, we're going to see that those are those coins we've been looking for to unmask their criminal history and we're going to say HEY KID WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE.  And then you just need to subpoena the exchange for the years old records, and then subpoena the last mixer and hope they were lying about dumping logs, and then interrogate the cabbie until they remember their years old fare, find that fruit cart seller who rode in that taxi and ask them who bought the fruit, then you need to find that person and ask who they bought the coins on the street from, torture that person until they admit they got them by selling on the Silk Road, somehow break DPR's security and unexpectedly find that he'd kept historic logs of Silk Road transactions, then successfully unmask another mixer, correlate with the hopefully amazingly extensive logs from yet another exchange, etc., etc., etc.

My guess is that the market is still wrong and bitcoins are worth way more than this price.  Like I saw some news recently about someone winning more than three hundred million dollars in a lottery, and I thought: According to the market prices, they just won enough to buy like a third of all bitcoins and to buy every extant litecoin many times over.  That doesn't seem to me to be accurately priced at all.  But I don't know much economics so maybe I just don't get it. :)

This has also thrown the implementation of colored coins into chaos.  Not that it won't still be implemented, but this has opened up questions about which path will be the easiest or safest way to implement it now. 
I wonder: Which chain actually *is* the best right now for casual exchanges of less then a penny?  It's certainly not Bitcoin.  Is there anything with a somewhat stable low value and low transaction costs, even with a high risk?  You should be able to withstand a huge level of risk on sending a fraction of a cent.  There's certainly all sorts of volatile dustcoins if you don't mind your recipient getting a wildly different fraction of a cent than the fraction you meant to send them.  Hmm.

I can't really respond to your hypothetical because I can't bring myself to imagine this part: 


They don't.  As soon as cryptocurrency grasps the many territories and traditions sometimes erroneously described as "China," they struggle for a moment mindlessly as a caught fish flops, thinking they can simply "ban" Bitcoin as they banned Q Coin &amp; etc., but they cannot.  Since they are very weak anyway they then immediately fall.

Since the difficulty of mining adjusts itself to who's on the network, there actually _are_ many bitcoin-clone networks out there secured only by relatively very easy problems.  You can make one yourself any time for free and it will be secured by nothing and you can mine all the coins yourself!  Fun!  From one perspective there's no "problem" at all with any such toy network, as I'm sure they all process transactions properly in practice.  The only "problem" is that it would theoretically be possible to swoop into any of those little networks with a big computer and own them.  They can still be trusted with *something*, they fairly reliably send a certain sort of message, but they certainly can't be trusted with your life savings.  Bitcoin are more valuable because a larger network secures them.

It needs change in order to match your intuition of how it works to pay for something. :)  The actual underlying system for transferring some coin is very simple: You choose input addresses to take coin out of, and output addresses to put coin into, and you choose how much of the coin inputted goes to each of the outputs.  What you typically want to do when making a transaction is to take an address or addresses where you have some random amount as the input, and for the outputs you want to direct the purchase price to the agent you're purchasing from, a tiny bit to the miners so they'll process your transaction quickly, and the rest back to yourself, either at the same address or a new address or some other address you control-- the leftover part that you direct back to yourself is the "change." 
You cannot know which is the change and which is the purchase unless you can tell who controls the secrets behind the addresses the coin is outputted to.  It's also possible to just send two different agents other than yourself each part of the output of a transaction, in which case there isn't any change address at all.  Or you could send multiple parts of the output to various addresses under your control, so that more than one of the outputs is change.  Or you can make a transaction where you control all of the output addresses, just tumbling the coins, which you could think of as having all of the addresses be change. 
This is part of why it is very difficult to discern any meaning from the blockchain.  You can see plainly that coins are moving between addresses, but there are quite a lot of agents moving them and they're identified only by their knowledge of unique secrets (which you can tell absolutely nothing about the content of), and so you mostly can't tell which collections of addresses are owned by which agent or even really how many agents they are or what if anything they're doing. 
For bank transfers they get around these complications by having no security at all and simply storing your balance as a number a few times on some servers somewhere and calling it a day. ;)

Some merchants are already accepting litecoin, just because they personally like it or are betting on it I'd guess, but why does it even matter if they do?  Litecoin is easier and easier to transform into bitcoin, so you can buy anything with it that you can buy with bitcoin with just that tiny extra step of converting it to bitcoin.  That means it's reasonable for someone to accept litecoin to settle a debt or sale at the current exchange rate *even if no one else is accepting it and they have no personal need for it* simply because they can convert it instantly into bitcoin or whatever they do need. 
Instantly and nearly free is qualitatively and not just quantitatively different than costing whole days and dollars.  The friction now is too low for it to match our old expectations that currencies will maintain some boundaries between them; those boundaries were artificial and/or technical and don't apply here. 
There's nothing to keep all of the cryptocurrencies from just slushing together into one big mess, where you put in whatever currency you have and get out whatever you need, and no one even knows or understands what particular currencies they're actually using except the bots and their trainers.

I feel like the "faucet" metaphor is stretched too thin by now.  You can't just have a faucet anymore, really.  A faucet was this thing you could have that just gives you bitcoins if you turn it on.  Now that doesn't work, because the Bitcoin ecosystem has gotten good at detecting and sucking up any free value.  Any old-fashioned faucet quickly ends up with a hose attached to it.  That's fine, that's what we asked for, that's a currency! 
What we're talking about making instead now is bots that actively go out and give people coins.  They sneak out and put coins somewhere and then hide again so nobody can follow after them to drain their stash.  They have to be somehow unpredictable or unreliable, they have to act on their own initiative so they can't be gamed. 
For our trouble bothering to be just sneaky enough to deal with the scammers and spammers what we could gain, potentially, is the first worldwide system for the voluntary redistribution of wealth.  So that could be interesting. 
What I think we should do is open source a simple bot that goes around looking for some criteria and tipping.  Then everyone can run their own copy of that bot with whatever [amusing]( or useful patterns they think of, and we'll see what happens!  May a million faucetbots bloom.

I think what's confusing about it is that the fees are so low.  It doesn't match intuitions from interacting with systems with higher fees.  The standard fee has been ฿0.0005 for a long time, which has only lately come anywhere near approaching a real amount of money; it's presently two and a half cents.  More confusingly this fee is often described as "optional," and in fact if you don't pay it it won't be long at all before some miner will take pity upon you and include your transaction without any fee at all.  They do this because it doesn't cost them anything because there still aren't enough transactions to fill up all the blocks all the time, so if they don't even have enough people paying two cents each to fill up their whole block they might as well throw you in for free.  They don't have to and presumably they won't and people are discussing how that's going to work out and nobody really knows.

One strange thing is that last I knew the most popular brainwallet algorithm wasn't the right one at all.  People were using something that just hashes the password once, which is ridiculous.  Then anyone can take billions of guesses at things that might be brain wallets.

It's not really mostly a majority process, it's consensus.  You can choose a chain if you have a majority of the hashing, but you have to choose from chains considered valid by the nodes you want to convince.  You don't need a majority at all to declare a certain pattern of chain valid-- any group can refuse the dominant opinion (they can "stand aside" as you say in formal consensus) and acknowledge their own reality.  People with hashing power can then express an opinion on which chain should be lengthened *within* that new reality, but cannot force those nodes to forget their new story and recognize a chain they don't want to.

It's a bot that tells another bot to send Bitcoin transactions to the Bitcoin network.  Basically it's a layer over the bare bones of Bitcoin to make it more nimble and useful. 
You can send a Bitcoin transaction just by typing a text command to a "daemon" called "bitcoind" but no one does-- everyone at least uses a basic client written in a bit of gooey GUI called "QT" to figure out their transactions for them. 
A web wallet like blockchain.info is another layer easier-- you don't even run an actual Bitcoin node at all, you just use their interface to send transactions over to their node, so you can use it on small devices for instance. 
And then bitcointip adds another layer on top of *that*, so you don't even have to make an account or log in anywhere or figure out a transaction at all. 
And if there's any possible way at all to make it even easier to transfer bitcoin than that then someone's probably going to figure it out soon. ;)

But it's still weird somehow.  Everyone's just like "wow, my first tip" "wow, my first tip" "wow, my first tip"!  Such a great chorus of "wow, my first tip"!  It makes me wonder what everyone here will be saying together next. :O

One problem with this false dichotomy is that historically being "un"regulated or "less" regulated has just meant not having particular *sorts* of regulations.  There's always still been plenty of regulation for instance on normal people as they interact with banks-- you can't take away their riches, you can't seize their locations, you can't refuse to pay them your debts, you can't even lie to them.  So of course "un"regulating them as in not regulating ONLY what THEY do to YOU, while still prohibiting you from doing anything back to them, just gives them even more ability to hurt people with no consequences.

The value of bitcoin that you have is not related **AT ALL** to what you paid for it.  That is the sunk cost fallacy.  For instance, consider what happens when someone receives a bitcointip: The price they paid for that bitcoin is **zero**, but that does not mean that it is necessarily rational to cash out the tip immediately for an infinite profit over what they paid.  What you pay for something is a personal experience personal to you and has shit all to do with the value of a commodity to the wider world.

Are you even trying to make sense?  You're assuming it's moral that money magically comes to you out of the bitcoin system even though you don't understand where it's coming from.  **It's rent for the monopoly on the network**.  Geez.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:04:16
It's a fine idea but difficult to implement.  The problem is that supply and demand aren't (yet?) signaled in the system.  A cryptocurrency system only knows the things inside of itself, it's like a person trapped in a room with no communication with the outside world except a teletype and no way to tell whether the symbols coming in on the teletype are from its best friend or worst enemy.  It couldn't tell a single damn thing about the world except for the magical existence of private keys and signing, which allows it to distinguish the existence of various agents-- it still can't tell apart humans or tell anything about them, but it can identify *agents* that it knows are different simply and only because they have access to different *secrets*. 
You can sorta inject outside facts by having a trusted agent, but it's an unstable system.  Bitcoin is stable because losing a key doesn't break everything, it just breaks the account connected to that key.  Any system founded upon a secret should be considered only a temporary system. 
OK I've been thinking about this for about half an hour and this is the best I can come up with.  Maybe in order to guess at its own price, a currency could sell things within itself for its own currency, to see how much people pay.  Namecoin for instance has a fixed charge for domain registration, but you could instead have it *auction* the right to register domains, which would allow it to see how much a Namecoin is worth relative to a .bit domain, at least!  Or you could have it vend anything else, just anything to get a signal, I thought of having it sell advertising-- there's a particular string of text or an image that's displayed in most of the clients perhaps, and an auction every once in a while to get to choose the next ad.  That could theoretically get a price signal into the system, but I can also think of a zillion spectacular ways it could fail if it wasn't perfectly balanced.  Hmm.

I like the vibe in this thread!  It seems clear here that what we're trying to do is to cooperatively share this useful technology.  It happens to be currency-like but that doesn't mean that the rest of us are trying to use it to make money from Cypriots or that Cypriots should try to use it to make money from us.  We are all just trying to share this technology and have it work, have it go back and forth all the time between Cyprus and everywhere else as a signal representing genuine value and gratitude and peace. 
The problem with giving away money for free isn't a problem with you.  You're a wonderful person (apparently, probably)!  But even with you being completely sincere it'll still throw things out of balance if we give you any money just for saying that you are from Cyprus and would like to share it there to get people started.  If we did that we would of course immediately tomorrow have twelve more strangers show up saying that they are also from Cyprus and they would like some too please. :D :D  So that could only work at most once so it's not mostly an effective strategy. 
That's sorta the root magic power of Bitcoin, actually, that it forces things to have genuine costs so it makes things real.  We have this thing now in our online space with some actual substance, so we have to demand something from you with some actual substance before we can let go of it.  It is real so it demands that the rest of the net become real with it. 
Spreading Bitcoin will be somewhat easier once the market for hiring unskilled labor for bitcoin finds any sort of clarity.  Presently there's far more labor available than there is coin to pay for it, which has temporarily pushed the actual price of labor in bitcoin so low that people are hesitant to actually make offers as low as what the price actually is, if you see what I mean, which is an odd situation.  Someday soon though that market should find its rock bottom and start to very slowly rise and from then on the crypto economy will provide a solid floor to wages all around the world which is kinda astonishing really.

In the game there's an in-game stock market, with fictional stocks about asteroid mining or whatever, and some people are getting rich buying and selling silly space stocks, which everyone assumes is just a cute form of gambling.  Actually, though, the space news about asteroid mining or aliens is translated into cute space world terms from real world news about the real dark web stocks that a bot is really executing trades on mirroring people's actions in the game.

The problem as I see it is that we're having trouble establishing prices for labor, particularly unskilled labor, mostly because a fair competitive price would be very very low.  Many of the people interested in Bitcoin don't have much or any at all yet, which means that there is an oversupply of people wanting to work which is greater than even what you'd expect from the already astonishing global rate of unemployment and underemployment and poverty.  This as usual pushes wages firmly towards zero. 
The problem I think is that we're always comparing to fiat prices and normal life, and so people are *embarrassed* to offer what's really the competitive fair market price for labor.  Even though lots of people are perfectly willing to do things for a mBTC, no one offers them anything to do because they feel weird naming a price of $0.12 to do something for them.  They're happy to indirectly pay a Bangladeshi factory worker that much to spend an hour sewing clothes for them because they don't see it, yet if they have to directly put it into words that they want someone to do something for them for a dime they can't.  That's my theory.

What would you like to use it for?  Bitcoin is just a tool.  It isn't a wind-up toy that you can just get some and watch it do what it does.  If you just have it then it just sits there being a number and nothing happens.  It's more of a hammer, you'll also need some nails and something you want to put together. 
Bitcoin makes it very easy to move value around the world.  That means it's easier for you to give things to people and do things for people on the internet.  You could just give things away to people for free, of course, but the problem is that unless you're wealthy already if you do that very long you will run out of stuff, and when you need someone to do something for you then "please do something for me because I did some things for other people before" might fly or it might not and it's pretty random.  With bitcoin you can relatively effortlessly design balanced interactions that are more economically sustainable.

When you get your first bitcoin tip you get a message from the bitcointip bot explaining it to you.  All you need to do is click "accept" in that message and it sets up an account for you.

You can also over-comment.  As much as possible you should explain the structure and meaning of the code *in* the code itself, you should make it obvious how it works.  Comments shouldn't be a redundant explanation of what the code does (which violates the DRY principle and will just result in inaccurate confusing comments as the code inevitably drifts from under them), they should provide additional information that can't be written in code, like *why* those algorithms and structures were chosen.  Just some extra commenting advice for everyone out there.  Style matters, kids, code is read way more often than it's written. :)

It takes an hour for the transaction to be confirmed to a depth at which it really could not *possibly* be undone, not by any supercomputer in the world with any access to anything.  That is not a level of confirmation that you ever require of anything else in life.  That is not the security of bank transfers or medical records or voting systems or self-driving cars or military drones or spaceships.  That level of security is *only* provided by the Bitcoin network.  It is therefore not analogous to anything else you are familiar with.  It is not what you intuit it to be.  It takes Bitcoin an hour to be sure of a transaction, OK, how long does it take credit cards or banks?  Never.  They *never* confirm transactions with any sort of cryptographic security which is in any way comparable to Bitcoin at all.  You *can* wait that long to confirm a Bitcoin transaction if you would like it to be more secure than *anything else* in modern society.  You do not need to.

Actually the best practice is to give out a different address for *each* payment that you receive.  It's fairly harmless to reuse the same one, but using a different one each time keeps everything very orderly and clean.  The standard bitcoin desktop client actually has like a hundred addresses or something generated in advance, to make sure the "new" addresses you generate are already in your recent wallet backup!  That's mostly what a wallet backup means is a copy of the private keys to some addresses, maybe also a bit of metadata like what you have the addresses labelled. 
The bitcoin isn't stored on anyone's computer, it's stored in the network.  For instance in [this thread]( people here are discussing coins that have been thrown to an address that it's obvious *no one* has the private key for (generating a private key that's particular words is very difficult and can only be done for a few letters at most).  The private key doesn't even have to EXIST in our universe, as that one surely doesn't, in order for some bitcoin to be considered by the network to belong to some public key.  The private key is only necessary if you want to actually *move* the bitcoin-- with the private key matching a public address, you can "sign" a statement (that is, use an algorithm to determine from the statement something that only someone who has the private key can find out, but anyone can easily check if it's right) saying that the bitcoin should be moved.  If and only if the signed public statement checks out, and therefore it's a mathematical certainty that whoever or whatever produced the statement has access to that private key, we all consider the bitcoin moved.  So access to the private key is the same thing as control of the bitcoin, because if you can use that private key just once to sign a statement you can move all the bitcoin in the account to anywhere you want.

I don't have any coins in cold storage yet myself (nor many coins anywhere at all).  In a year or two there should be lots of better options than we have now.  There's a whole reddit now for discussing the merits of various wallet technologies: @_date: 2013-04-18 16:37:57
The bitcointip bot makes you an account associated with your username the first time someone tips you (or when you ask it to).  The bot has access to the private key for the Bitcoin address it gives you, and it'll give you a copy of it as well (which is a good idea so you could get your money out if heaven forbid the bot went down forever).  When someone tips it creates a transfer from the address it associates with that person's Reddit to the address it associates with the person they're tipping (generating it if it doesn't already exist).  Unaccepted tips are eventually transferred back to the person who sent them.  You can put money into your tip wallet by sending it from another Bitcoin client to your tip address, and you can take your money out either by taking control of the private keys yourself and transferring it out, or just telling the tip bot to tip it to an address you control.
@_date: 2013-03-07 12:46:56

Well you should still split up your holdings, at some point.

We should all spread our coins out.  There's really pretty much no way that you're going to wake up one day to find that your laptop wallet, phone wallet, online wallet, paper wallets printed on a different computer, paper wallets printed on a dedicated paper wallet printer, and 2-factor Casascius bars have ALL been simultaneously hacked from the outside.

OK look I've given up on you actually getting very far with this.  I just want to hammer this home to you: Anarchists support large group organization.  Large group organization is the heart and soul of Anarchism.  I would say that Anarchists *only* care about large group organization.  Organizing large groups is what Anarchists do.  You writing me this pointless inaccurate nonsense interrupted me watching a video about many thousands of people doing something organized by Anarchists.  Because that's what we do.  Anarchists like large groups.  We organize large groups.  We use the word "organize" a lot and we are talking about large groups, because Anarchists are in favor of and fond of organizing large groups.  It's something we do often.  We organize large groups.  We've done it often in history.  We succeed in it.  We're very good at it, because we're not just in favor of it but have it as the center of our political philosophy.  The Anarchist idea is to organize large groups.  It is to organize groups as large as possible.  Anarchists organize large groups.  Anarchists organize large groups.  Anarchists like to organize large groups into organized activities.  We like to be highly organized.  We like to organize a lot of people.  We like to organize a lot of people together into the same activity.  That is what we do.  That is what Anarchism means.  Anarchists organize large groups.  Anarchists organize large groups.  Anarchists organize large groups.

Dogecoin isn't actually just a program written by someone, it's an agreement on a protocol.  There's a full consensus at the moment on the protocol proposed by the reference Dogecoin client, but that's just a proposal (in the form of code).  It's a terrible proposal of course in the terms we normally evaluate coins by-- as well as the dust it has an absurdly sharp supply curve, etc.  The way it's a successful protocol right now is that it's a *funny* protocol.  That's not how things usually work, it's true, but that's why Dogecoin is historic. (: +10 doge

The actual costs of their services have *already* plummeted to zero, because our currency is already electronic.  They've simply lied about that and kept charging lots of money for things that are actually free and elbowing new entrants out of their market and amassing a giant pile of money.  They put in artificial costs like regulatory compliance.  Artificial costs are great because you can sculpt the cost curves however you need to to make yourself the one who can profit.  But they're also vulnerable to systemic collapse.

It could easily stabilize again, it'd just have to find a value that makes any sense.  It could be stable around $1000 or something now I bet.  The problem is that stable at $100 doesn't make any sense, and moving quickly up through $200 doesn't make sense *either*.  At $200 and especially $250 a whole lot of people would like to sell and be wealthy in some other asset for a while and stop worrying about whether it's going to go to a thousand or zero.  And there's even more people who'd sell at $300 and $400 and a bunch more who'd definitely have to sell at $500.  So even though there's really no sense to the idea that it's not worth at least a thousand now that it's going mainstream, it can't actually be priced there without bumping slowly through a bunch of corrections.  Weird.

I'm sure it could be designed in a newbie friendly way.  I actually think the system where it just comes up with a whole different set of transactions and accounts when you put in different passphrases would be pretty easy for most people to grok.  You could present it for instance as one bitcoin installation being able to be used by more than one person/group/agent, because you get a different profile depending on what you type in.  A new user would try it out typing it a few different things and sending money between them and get a sense of how it works, and then if sometime you put in the wrong password and got a blank account with no names or transactions or anything it'd be obvious what went wrong.

If you personally mine a block you can put whatever (valid) transactions you want in it.  If a pool mines a block then the pool operator decides the content of the block, though people could and would leave their pool very quickly if the content was seen to be malicious. 
This begs a question: Couldn't it be profitable for large pools to negotiate transaction fees off the official network?  If they accept the official fees listed on transactions they just get one generic public bid from each transactor, but if they negotiate privately with individual transactors they should be able to offer them stronger guarantees for a better price.  In my opinion there are two main reasons why this efficiency hasn't been claimed: First, it is rather a small efficiency, especially since block rewards dwarf transaction fees anyway and there's not much competition to get into blocks.  Second and probably more importantly, it certainly *could* be viewed as malicious or is at least suspicious, so pool operators (being politically sensitive) can't touch it with a ten foot pole.

I would say that now we get a chance, a choice.  We printed a quadrillion satoshi and gave them to anyone who wanted them for free, thousands in exchange for ordinary pizzas, anyone with a few cents, and now random people just for being on Reddit.  We didn't give any to Africa yet because they mostly don't have computers.  As soon as they do have computers or we write something that works on the phones they have or whatever it takes to bridge the gap, then we have an *opportunity* to share with them too. 
You can't fault people for not having already shared when it wasn't possible yet.  You can indeed fault them if they don't next share now that they have the opportunity.  This could indeed be used as another moment to exploit Africa, to say that they're not allowed into our newest game unless they give up more land and blood.  It could be and I'm not saying it won't.  But you can't judge now.  The time to judge comes next; now is the time to act. 
We could also say to Africa: We hate our governments as much as you hate yours.  We have not been meaning to oppress you.  We have created this vision, this lifeboat we hope could save us all, and we are welcoming you aboard.  It's difficult but it's possible. 
What's another option?  Tell Africa they should just wait to get involved, since they don't have enough computers yet?  Once they have computers they can come and see if there's any bitcoins left for them?  Maybe if we can get some coin to them as soon as possible then they can *buy some computers* and the rest of the tools they need to fight the lie that Africa is poor.

I'd say it's more that it's unquestionably good for Bitcoin as a technological system and as a culture-- at best it's a viable option that gives us more choices, and at worst a failed experiment that teaches us something-- and unquestionably bad for the market price of Bitcoin-- either by being successful competition or (theoretically if it fails) by providing a terrifying example of how chains can go wrong.

Yes, it would be possible to build escrow directly into a cryptocurrency system, or to build features that more directly support escrow.  I think you can build almost any business model directly on a blockchain and we should move that way in order to open source and publicly verify as many of our business processes as possible.

Distributed enough TO WHOM?  Among what set of agents?  You are thinking of humans.  But humans *do not exist* in the world of a cryptocurrency.  You must learn to think and feel like a cryptocurrency.  To imagine yourself a cryptocurrency, imagine yourself trapped in a room with NO communication or connection to the outside world except for a teletype of text streaming in.  You may write questions and receive answers.  But here's the thing: You can't trust the answers.  All you get is a string of nonsense from an endless parade of liars.  The characters all come in the same black and white no matter who wrote them, no matter how sinister their motives. 
The only saving grace we have found for this predicament is cryptographic signing.  The text coming in can be signed, in which case we can tell that the agent sending it has access to a certain *secret*.  The secret can be anything, any digital data.  You cannot tell who the agent is.  You cannot tell what the secret is.  You are given no warning when more humans intentionally or unintentionally become part of the agent by learning the secret.  All you can tell is that various messages are guaranteed to have come from the same agent; *all* that means is that they all were created by some being in the world that has access to some secret.  Nothing at all else. 
Requiring hard hashes is a desperate but successful attempt to get *any* more information into the system.  The information it gets into the system is a rough estimate of how much computing power has been devoted to computing the hash.  That's it.  You have to relaize how tiny these slivers of information are.  We can't pinpoint humans.  We can't tell anything about the agents that are talking to us at all except that they have access to certain secrets, not even what the secrets are.  This new piece of information is just a *rough* estimate of how much computing power someone controls (who we cannot identify, *at all*-- Bitcoin tricks them into revealing that they control just one secret, by paying them!!). 
What Bitcoin uses the hashes for that's essential is to put any time ordering on the information coming into it.  AHA that one slipped by you, didn't it?  You assumed the papers coming to you had ANY association with the order of ANY events in the world.  That is not one of our tiny slivers of information.  Our enemies are so much more powerful than us that they can even send us our messages all out of order of how they were written in an attempt to fool us.  We need to do a devilishly clever trick with requiring a chained sequence of hashes to have any evidence that anything happened in any order at all. 
I would very much like to make a system that distributes rewards better.  I'm thinking a lot about how to do it.  But I don't think it's as easy as you're suggesting.

Who said it's groundbreaking?  I don't recall it ever trying to be groundbreaking.  The idea was and is just to create an alternative cryptocurrency on a different network with a different algorithm so there's some basic diversity. 
What it does that Bitcoin can't is to secure a chain with scrypt, thereby enlisting a different segment of the world's hardware in securing cryptocurrency.  It lost some of it's *raison d'être* for a while when both Bitcoin and Litecoin were most efficiently mined on GPUs, but it's now back to expanding the hardware involved in computing blockchains by providing a continuing role for other processors after the rise of Bitcoin ASICs. 
Litecoin's usefulness as a fallback network isn't purely theoretical: The Litecoin network did already continue to process transactions flawlessly during the Bitcoin fork in March.  In practice it is successfully diversifying and strengthening our cryptocurrency system as a whole.

Yeah.  Donating at the same time to the same thing as a gimmick would indeed be considered newsworthy, because it makes something exciting happen at one moment, even though it wouldn't especially do anything to help the world.  The fact that Bitcoin is used mostly for charity, most of the time, all day long by everyone, that isn't newsworthy at all of course, because it's spread out.  Did I mention BTW that the media are corrupt and broken and awful and obsolete and it doesn't matter at all?  Yeah.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:54:31
Yeah I wouldn't suggest really trying to implement it in an existing system.  It would feel insulting to people-- not sure why exactly or if that's rational but it's so.  But I'm really surprised new systems aren't emerging right now to pay people for their computation or storage. 
Storage might be even simpler than computation.  You'd need to choose computations where you can cheaply verify the result, which is possible but mildly tricky.  But with storage you can provide encrypted data, and verify it was accurately returned by checking the hash.  There's no reason any space on anyone's hard drive should be empty any more. 
It'll mostly push out the charity computation once it's established, but it's unstoppable so oh well.  Most of the charity computation was going to random speculative shit anyway like SETI since it was free-- maybe even scientists should get clear signals of the costs of their computation so they're pressured to use it wisely. :P 
One nice thing about everyone's computers learning how to resell their resources is that people will stop needing to ask us how to get any BTC at all or trying to mine and contributing a tiny amount of hashes that makes no difference to anything.  Soon the intuition will change to expecting every device to gradually earn back most of its own cost.

But you must recognize that there is *some* market for Linden Dollars and that they have value.  There's also a tiny obscure unimportant market for litecoin, for terracoin, for WoW gold, for Interstellar Kredits I guess, for a lot of different things.  If any of them seriously rivaled bitcoin *today*, we would be having a very different conversation.  I'm just pointing out that it's a lot different to assert "bitcoin is the only online currency that can work" vs just to say "the other online currencies are functioning just fine, but it's unlikely that any of them will ever escape their niches."  I don't buy it.  Why shouldn't they grow?  There's every incentive.  Bitcoin was in a tiny niche too, and recently.

The people who have a bunch of Bitcoin would love stability, but they would like it around $100,000-$1,000,000 somewhere please.  On the other hand, according to Mt Gox someone somewhere is currently willing to sell at $115.  Stable sounds great.  Stable *where*?

There's no particular reason the value of bitcoins needs to increase for there to be enough cryptocurrency.  There's other networks, for instance.  The units we're buying newspapers in are still local currencies, and then some device converts to an amount of BTC.  Soon you'll be able to pay in a zillion different currencies and it'll convert any of them.  Stuff will keep having local prices just because half the people won't have switched off the old system, so it's hybridizing.

They're just looking for hooks to write stories about.  They don't care whether Bitcoin=Drugs is a fair characterization, the point was just that Silk Road was a very compelling story.  They don't care whether the government trying to bring down Bitcoin is a good thing or a bad thing, the point is just that Government vs Bitcoin has some drama to it.  Right now the most exciting thing you can say about Bitcoin is that it's gone up in value a lot and people are getting rich (and maybe it has something to do with China, throw that exotic spice in there).  If something more exciting comes along then the reporting will continue to follow the blood.

Yeah there's a few different tip bots now, and and I dunno a YaCoin one or something and maybe a few others.  They're programs running on some computer somewhere that have control over some cryptocurrency accounts.  So if you give each bot whatever register command they'll make you an account and associate addresses with it.  The bot will tell you a deposit address you can send to, and then if you send coins to that addresses they'll show up in your account.  You can tell the bots to tip to addresses too, so you can withdraw money from a bot by telling it to send some of your money to an address of another of your wallets.  The bot also has a highly recommended option where you can make an associated blockchain.info account which would make it possible to transfer your funds out even if the bot were down.

Bitcoin has few or no democratic structures.  It's a "democracy" of mining power, just as corporations are "democracies" of voting shares.  There's the potential for human democratic intervention if we make intelligent collective decisions about which chains to respect and value, but we'd have to *actually make* social structures within which to reach those decisions; deep democracy won't be handed to us magically by the incentive structure built into an automated process.

Well it depends on what the competing technology is.  Some things would be integrated, if it was obvious how they fit in.  But for instance Ripple is claiming to be better than Bitcoin for various applications, but it's also totally different structurally, it's some web of trust layout.  So no one's even considering bolting on a whole different web of trust mechanism onto Bitcoin just because some people are interested in Ripple now.  Ripple doesn't fully displace the role of Bitcoin, and I can't think of anything that would, but maybe someone else can, I think it's possible.  It's certainly worth considering if you're talking about the risks to bitcoins' value.  For instance there could be an alternative that's a truly decentralized evolving system with no central agreed *anything*, which could be too chaotic for *any* particular system to replicate.

From another perspective, you won't own any meaningful percentage of the entire cryptoproperty market.  Bitcoin is just one little smart property, a gateway smart property, a way for people to get value into the net so they can do solid things here.  It might end up as most of the cryptocurrency market, or it might end up as just one competitor in a wide field, but either way it's likely to be a significant part of that market (unless we're all wrong).  That doesn't mean however that it'll be a significant portion of the wealth in the world; that doesn't mean it's the only interesting thing that will happen. 
BItcoin could climb over the next few years to an equivalent worth of millions of 2013 US dollars and still be vastly outperformed by other cryptoassets.  If your investment objective is a comfortable human life, you can just sit on BTC and you should be fine, but then you could just do *nothing* and that should be fine too since probably we'll soon institute some sort of guaranteed basic income.  Every human being will be very well provided for by today's standards; you will somehow be able to afford basic boring things like houses and cars and immortality that will not impress you then at all. 
Electronic assets as a whole will soon be worth far more than this particular physical planet.

A hashing algorithm is an algorithm that produces very unpredictable outputs.  If you change the input just a little, the hash changes completely.  So there's no way to know what hash you'll get for what input except to go through and do the hash. 
What a Bitcoin miner does is to put together all the recent transactions (and some other stuff, like a link to the previous block so that they form a chain), and then try to hash that.  They get some random unpredictable number.  So then they change the input just a little-- usually just by incrementing a number, but it doesn't matter what you do, since any little change to the data changes the hash completely-- and see what hash they get next. 
You have to get a hash that's REALLY REALLY low to win a bitcoin block-- it has to randomly happen to be a really low number, or to say the same thing differently, a number that starts with a zillion zeros.  Specifically it has to be lower than the current *difficulty*, which adjusts itself as more computers join the network so that no matter how many people are hashing the numbers you have to get get lower and lower and lower until it's *still* only one block found every ten minutes. 
But there are lesser prizes you can get.  If you're hashing blocks as part of a *pool*, which most people are now, instead of just hoping to get lucky and get the winning block yourself, you're working with a bunch of people hoping that one of you gets the block.  To prove that you're working, you submit your blocks if they're low enough by a *different* easier threshold set by the mining pool.  That's used to determine who's working how hard to solve the blocks, so the rewards can be distributed fairly when someone in the group gets lucky and finds one. 
So the problem is to find a very difficult hash of the recent transactions on the network.  This is very useful and valuable in itself, it's not just busywork.  It's useful *because* it's difficult to find.  If someone hands you a linked chain of blocks full of zillions of valid transactions signed by everyone with super low hashes of each block, they didn't just make that up on their laptop five seconds ago. :O  That came from the Bitcoin network or it came from some supercomputer the NSA has that we don't know about yet, because those are the only things that could *possibly* produce hashes that start with so many zeros.  So it proves to us that the record we have of recent transactions is secure and meaningful, even though it's not verified by any central authority.

Right, an "attacker" could just pay once to get access to a hidden route, but the payment they pay once is *the cost of providing* that hidden route, which they should then be free to spam as much as they like since they *bought* it, making them less of an "attacker" and more of a *customer*.  As long as what you're charging for a hidden route is just slightly *more* than the cost of providing it, you would very much like for *many* such "attackers" to purchase routes, which would make you wealthy.  Yes, if you need to be accessible, you are exposed.

There's something that for sure would collectively benefit everyone, but they must be forced to do it by an external agent because even though for sure it will benefit everyone they can't agree to it for some reason, but fortunately there's another agent with the ability and motive to overpower them for their own good???  This agent can be trusted to know better than everyone what would collectively benefit them, and always reliably altruistically forces them to those solutions because it has no motives or priorities of its own in spite of necessarily being a different agent????

It is regulated in code.  Running a bitcoin node which interprets the world in a certain way is a sort of vote for a system that works that way.  It's not a majority voting system, really-- there's a way to use a majority of hashing power to trick the system, but that's considered a (minor, more expensive than it's worth) vulnerability, not a legitimate part of the political system (not that it doesn't have undercurrent political effects!!)-- it's a *consensus system* where a group of peers who unanimously agree on a protocol are able to peacefully cooperate to enforce it, but no group can force another group to enforce any protocol. 
To ask your question another way, you could say: What if someone *doesn't* stop producing new bitcoin according to this supposedly mathematically enforced algorithm?  What if they just say, well, that was a fun idea, but I'm making another now?  The answer is: Their new pretend block doesn't count-- *unless someone agrees that it does*.  Anyone or even *everyone* could (theoretically-- good fucking luck) agree to follow the new rules someone just made up.  They could put a bunch of bitcoin nodes online that respect and register the new rules and transactions.  It would then become just as real as the current bitcoin rules are.  The odds of convincing everyone at once to do this are slim, of course, but it is a social problem more than a technical problem. 
Since it's hard to convince everyone at once to switch, that raises the question, what if you just got half of the people to switch?  Or just a few?  The answer is that the network would split in two, a network where the old rules are enforced and a network where the new splinter rules are enforced.  It would then be up to anyone which side of the split to respect and accept, for whatever reasons. 
It's likely of course that just about any time this happens people would go with the great bulk of the network that's following the traditional rules and not with any small new splinter network.  But nothing about the system *prohibits* you from splitting away, it just doesn't *support* or confirm or comprehend your new ideas.  It is a voluntary consensus system which respects anyone's right to stand aside.

Yes of course it does make Bitcoin less anonymous if you publicize what address you're using.  The USD is also somewhat less anonymous if every time you get a bill you shout loudly "HEY EVERYONE!  I JUST GOT BILL F70480525S!"  But there is a simple solution to this weakness, which is not to do that. ;)
I consider it a feature that as well as obscuring histories with Bitcoin you can also use it to make a provable public record of a series of transactions.  I describe it as a system where you can *choose* your level of anonymity, from nearly secret all the way through to instantly broadcasting everything you do to the whole world.

One way is just to say like "tip (insert your bitcoin address here) ALL" (either directly to the bot or anywhere it'll see it) and it'll send everything in your tip account to the address you specify.  You also can (and should) tell the bot "export account" and it'll give you a password for a new blockchain.info account that's attached to your tip account.  That way you can also log in there to transfer money out of that account.  If you're going to keep any bitcoin in the tip bot it's a very good idea to bother setting that up so you'd have another way to access your tip bot funds if the tip bot went down. :)

Litecoin seems to me to be viable.  It's not *as* secure as Bitcoin presently is-- Bitcoin is presently *by far* the world's largest supercomputer.  But the hashrate of Litecoin is increasing substantially now that it's getting the hashes of all the CPU and GPU rigs that can't mine Bitcoin anymore, so now it's becoming a pretty secure system.  So a distant second to Bitcoin but still *way* ahead of the rest of the pack. 
I don't know any coins other than Bitcoin and Litecoin that I'd really consider secure at this point, though it's possible some of the new entries might prove themselves over time.  For instance Terracoin uses the same algorithm (SHA256) that Bitcoin does, so it was recently tossed around by someone with a Bitcoin ASIC, who mined all the coins for a while and then left, making the difficulty so high that it took the rest of the network 12 hours to do each of the next few blocks. :O  So Terracoin is an example of a network that doesn't presently have enough hash power to be trusted very much at all.  But there's some attempt to tweak its code, and maybe they'll figure out some way to let it survive, who knows. :)

That article was really disappointing and confusing to me.  The first half of course makes perfect sense-- there's no way to enforce intellectual property on 3D printers, yet people are going to try for political reasons.  OK, so far so good.  But what's at the end of the fucking article?  AN IDEA FOR AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SCHEME THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO ENFORCE FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  What? 
The unstated logic seems to be that people *will* comply with *this* system, because it has what seems to the author like a reasonable price, based on the vast amount of both wealth and police that the author is accustomed to.  The price of $1 echoes for instance the "successful" copyright regime of iTunes songs; I put "successful" in quotes because of course it can only be considered successful if you limit your vision entirely to the only tiny group of people in the world rich enough to even consider paying $1 for a non-item; it has not actually succeeded with the vast majority of the world's population and never, never will. 
The kids have their own intellectual property scheme now where putting "no copyright is intended" on your Tumblr makes it AOK.  No, I don't know what the fuck that means either, but neither you nor I can remove it from all the blargs on the interwebs, so it's going to stay the law of the land.  If you have a different idea than that of how copyright should work you'd have better luck realizing it by convincing people to put it in their headers and descriptions than by trying to get it into the law books; *nobody reads those*.

You can't go lower than zero so you have to give them the evil eye or something. ;)  Putting the payment for average service above zero allows you to express a whole range of feelings-- 0%-10% terrible, 10%-20% acceptably good, 20%-30% very good, 30%+ exceptional.

I believe there have been various proposals for where the colored coins could be considered to go, so that they can be kept apart and traded.  There's various possible rules any of which would work fine, we just have to agree on a specific clear protocol. 


By coloring some coins you can issue a new currency (or stock, or any sort of property or contracts) for free with the full strength of an existing blockchain.  So I could take a bitcoin and color it and call it Mungojellycoin and then everyone can decide for themselves the value of mungojellycoins relative to everything else depending on what I do with them and what market develops for them.  You might think mungojellycoins are worthless, but unlike an alternate blockchain there's nothing you can do to attack it if you can't disrupt the entire parent network.

฿0.25 is an essentially impossible valuation.  What does that mean, BTC and LTC are neck and neck?  How could that be?

I like Litecoin a lot, but Bitcoin is the established brand.

Anarcho-syndicalists specifically support the formation of syndicates, which are just the people in an industry running that industry together.  It's sorta like a "union" but it's not some little wimpy thing fighting or begging from some external employing boss or corporation-- instead the "union" is itself the very body that operates the business and has *complete* control over it.  For instance one of the most full implementations in history of this idea was in revolutionary Catalonia, where the fundamental operation of the society was taken over completely by CNT, a radical union.  For instance instead of the train system being run by a corporation, or the government, or even some elected board, it was run *directly* by the very engineers who actually knew how to run the fucking trains-- needless to say, they had no trouble doing massive repairs to the system in just a few days to get them running, and then they kept them running perfectly through the whole war.  What brought an end to the CNT's control of the rainway was just that eventually (tragically) a government was reformed and came to "restore order" for the rich people by sending police to *stop* the railway workers from running their own railway-- and they managed to break through the poor people's barricades and gain control-- and then of course the trains went back to being shit. ;)
One of the decision making systems used by syndicates is Spokes Councils, also called "mandated/recallable delegates."  Spokes Councils are a way better idea than representative democracy.  It's pretty simple really.  You have like thousands of people who want to decide together what to do.  Maybe they're a city or maybe they're just [a bunch of people who got together to Occupy a nuclear facility]( or whatever.  They're happy to hear everyone's perspectives on what to do but they *can't* wait *literally forever* to hear from everyone; there are thousands of people so one big noisy meeting is just not going to work. 
So you form into groups.  Just voluntarily, anyone can group up with whoever they want.  The people you came with, someone who seems cool, whatever, hopefully someone you can communicate well with and work together well with.  Then each group chooses a delegate, a Spoke, to go to an inter-group meeting, the Spokes Council.  So like there's a thousand people, but they get together into groups of 10-20, and each group chooses a Spoke, so then there's less than a hundred Spokes which is a somewhat manageable size for a meeting. 
So then the Spokes sit together and have a conversation, each speaking on behalf of their group and representing the views of their group.  But they don't have power over their group!  Quite the opposite!  If what they say *doesn't* really represent the group's opinions fairly, they can be recalled and replaced with a different Spoke.  Often the whole group the Spoke is supposedly speaking for is *sitting right there* around them, ready to recall them *immediately* if what they say isn't what the group asked them to say. 
Decisions made by the Spokes Council are also not themselves *binding* upon anyone, and neither the Spokes nor anyone else has any power to force anyone to comply with the agreements.  Instead what happens when the Spokes think that something is a good agreement is that they propose it to the whole supposedly-represented community, to see if they *have* actually been represented!!  Fancy that!  Each Spoke has to check with the rest of their group to see if they really consent to that agreement, and if not they bring their objections back to the meeting.  So the Spokes Council is not an instrument to *replace* the consent of the whole group, it is just an instrument to make it easier to *find* a consensus of the whole group (without talking about it literally all night). 
Spokes Councils are pretty simple, really.  The real question is why do the supposedly "democratic" governments *not* work that way?  Why when someone "represents" you and then what they vote for *isn't* what you would have chosen, why is that binding??  At best it's a system designed around the limitations of horse-based communication, and at worst and more likely it's just a lie, a way for rich people to keep control. 
Making decisions by agreement so that you don't have to shoot anyone to get them to happen isn't actually all that fucking difficult.

With a lot of systems your computer would just check with some server and say "hey, how much bitcoin do people have right now?" and whatever answer it got it would say "oh, OK, great, sounds good!" and display that as the truth of what's happening.  If that's how bitcoin worked, it wouldn't be a secure place to put millions of dollars. :)  The motive to somehow put in a tricky server to tell someone you have money you don't would be tremendous.  Instead, your computer is downloading a huge amount of data and *actually checking it all* to make sure that it's right, checking the hashes to see that there's actually proof of work there that these are the transactions that were mined at enormous and unreproducible expense and not just transactions I just made up that say that I end up with a million bitcoin. ;)  After your computer chews through those blocks, it will know what is *really* verifiably happening on the bitcoin network with near absolute certainty.

We don't have a very functional labor market.  People offering random services on reddits hardly anyone reads isn't going to make many good connections.  I think in the short term the best way to get paid BTC for work is to make general offers and price them ridiculously low. 
The market's having trouble finding a price for simple labor and I think that's because people are unwilling to admit how low the fair price really is-- people are already actually putting in real labor to get satoshi, literally just dozens of satoshi, from faucets.  They take that offer because it's the only offer in that range because people aren't willing to admit that's what the current price is because it's entirely bizarre.  Really I think a human could offer just hundreds or thousands of satoshi to people to do actual complex things and find plenty of workers.  It's an odd situation.

I'm legitimately new to Bitcoin and I very much appreciated the millibit I got from this bot, but then I was searching  on Twitter and I saw a bunch of accounts claiming them with random numbers at the ends of their names and it was sad. :( 
I guess we have no choice but to demand from people that they do or be something with a value more than what we're giving them.  That's *why* there's no free lunch in the world-- not because people aren't generous, but because after the first few days there would really be a nearly infinite demand for the free lunches, external systems springing up attempting to distort/control access to them (like someone standing blocking the "Free Lunch" sign saying "Oh the free lunches? They cancelled that," while really their friends are inside getting them), and very cheap resold lunches available around the corner. ;) 
We don't have to make *arbitrary* hoops for people to jump through, though.  We can ask them to fairly exchange us some value that's especially easy/pleasurable for them to provide to us because of who they are.  At best this can be a system to allow and validate people's best selves. 
For instance I think it would make sense to extend Bitcoin to artistic and creative people by commissioning creative works.  We'd have to request specific qualities to prevent plagiarism, like for instance if we just said "a bitcent for a picture of a bitcoin" we'd have to check the submissions against all the pictures of bitcoins on the internets to see if it was actually original content, but if we said "a bitcent for a picture of a bitcoin surrounded by laurels on a slate grey background" or whatever random details, we could be sure that fair effort had been put into the work, and we'd also get to have the fun of making up what art we'd like to see. :)

Yeah, the problem is that distributed systems can't keep secrets.  Can they?  If they can we don't know how yet.  We're trying to figure out that shit about doing computation on encrypted values without being able to learn the values, but I still can't quite imagine how that could lead to putting secret information inside a distributed system but-- maybe!? 
Here's something I think could possibly work: GoCoin (or ChessCoin, but Go is better if you want to favor humans over machines).  As well as normal transactions sending GoCoins, you could also send messages to the network offering and accepting to play games of Go, submitting moves to ongoing games, perhaps placing bets on other people's games, and entering tournaments.  The system could generate coins both for miners and also for the winners of the tournaments.  So that wouldn't distribute generated coins fairly to all of humanity, but it would at least reward Go masters as well as technical expertise and hardware. :)

That's the thing about secrets, is that we can't *tell* whether your computer exploded or whether that was all the copies of the key.  Maybe you can't either.  Maybe you thought for three years they were deleted-- but oh shit no, there was a copy on this old flash drive too, here they are!  Or maybe you're just *saying* you destroyed the keys to throw us off the trail, maybe you really printed them out and buried them in a 100 year time capsule.  The system can't tell and doesn't judge.  If anyone *ever* reemerges with that secret, for whatever reason, they get the bitcoins.  That means you can secure for *yourself* your own patterns of how secrets can potentially be recovered.  The rest of us can't know and just have to trust you.  Leaving coins to your great grandkids, writing brainwallet puzzles that might never be solved, flushing BTC down the toilet, it's up to you, whatever you want to do.

No, I don't think it will be a way to launder cash, exactly, not for long-- I think even offline drug dealers will *stop accepting cash at all*. 
The precise legal status of the bitcoin changing industry is uncertain, but it's certainly likely to be less illegal than drugs since the drug sentences have gotten longer than murder/rape/anything sentences, so the people in the money changing grey market will probably try to keep ignorant of what the coins they're selling are spent on, so it'll probably be mostly a separate market from the drug market.  The drug market can then also reduce its friction/exposures by using cryptocurrency instead of cash (incidentally, waiting for confirmations is less of an issue with this sort of retail). 
Never mind the government-- they're just used by the whole drug industry as a prop, a part of the drama, and they're happy to play that role-- I think systems could emerge that are even threatening to the *cartels*, who are the serious engaged opposition to any changes in their system.

Anyone who is holding any currency is invested to that degree in that currency.  They may or may not intend to hold it as a long-term investment but they are invested in it.  Currencies tend not to be good long-term investments because they don't generally increase in value.  They're only used because they're a good short-term investment *if you need liquidity* because they're very liquid.  But if a currency reliably increased in value 5% year after year it would obviously be a very good long-term investment.  There's no conceivable way that could happen though, of course, so I don't know why it's been postulated.

It's not at all simple.  Anyone can control "Bitcoin" as in cause whatever they want to happen in a network which calls itself "Bitcoin" and has all the old transactions on it.  People with mining power can choose chains to respect and make them long and difficult and secure.  People who can run full nodes can choose chains to respect and give them distribution and relay transactions that accord with them.  The ultimate power though rests with people who accept particular chains as a payment or representation of value-- even if almost all the mining and almost all of the nodes go to some other chain, if there's a chain which is the one which is valued by people as the "real" valuable Bitcoin, that one's still the one to watch.  But it is generally understood and believed that people are far more likely to consider chains to be "real" and valid if they have mining power and/or full nodes endorsing them (and nodes respect chains with miners, and miners respect chains with nodes, etc.), so these factors are heavily interdependent.  It's actually a very interesting political situation (and certainly light years away from "pure laws of mathematics," that's horseshit).

Bitcoin is one of the greatest inventions in all of human history.  There are many famous inventors whose famous inventions were really just incremental improvements, Edison's lightbulb being the classic example.  Satoshi's invention is not such an incremental and predictable improvement.  It is that rarity of human history, a genuine stroke of genius, an idea which no one else came anywhere close to thinking of.  No one else thought of it and when it began no one thought it would work-- not cryptographers, not economists, not game theorists, not me and not you.  We were wrong.  Satoshi was right.

You've pointed out some annoying hurdles in getting your hands on bitcoin, which indeed are annoying.  But if you just get over one of the hurdles, scan your ID for someone or whatever, and get a bunch of coins, that same annoying barrier means that you can resell those bitcoins locally at a substantial premium.

It's just a very slightly different culture from your own.  It does have its own internal logic that's perfectly reasonable.  It might be confusing that it is not usually explained with absolute directness-- 15% is indeed often *described* as giving someone a "tip" for their "good service," but this is just a sort of obligatory compliment.  Really in our culture everyone understands restaurant menus to list prices approximately 15%-20% below the price you expect to pay if service is adequate.  Another way to think of it could be that restaurants here list the *minimum price* you may pay for the food.

Everything someone says to you about Bitcoin, realize that you're misunderstanding it in the same sorts of ways.  You hear some little story like "it's full of porn" or "an encyclopedia anyone can edit" and they're true but they're such small parts of the whole picture that it doesn't explain anything.  It's not so much any particular thing as a transformation of everything. 
Most of the seemingly outlandish things you'll hear actually are true, all of them, and it really is that strange, but they join together into a bizarre otherworldly tapestry where it makes a new sort of sense.  If anything it is often understated how much of a transformation this will be to every aspect of life.

They'll buy every business that ever accidentally blogged about Bitcoin for twice what it's worth.  They'll buy everybody's kid's closet worthless toy coin up to a buck just in case.  That will be a bubble; don't ask me when to sell.
The cryptocoins, now, a bubble?  A billion USD for ALL of them?  All the coins, please.  Not just Bitcoin, I want every single coin invented, all the BBQCoin and everything.  All of them.  Wrapped.  That'll be a tiny fraction of your fortune, Mr Gates!  Thanks for inventing WINDOWS!  DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?  That is insane.  That is what's insane.  And it's because nobody can believe or comprehend or *wants* to contemplate the enormity of the fact that Earth is already in the process of being Uploaded and there is nothing at all to be done about it.

It VIOLATES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.  I would recommend changing your system so that it is IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.  There are many things possible in this universe, and I don't much like your objectives, so I don't care to help you choose one of them, but you have chosen outside of that large set, you have chosen from the much larger set of IMPOSSIBLE THINGS.  For instance, in your system when someone copies information, something else happens at some other place to change the position of that person in society, but in reality when information is copied the universe takes *no* recognition of the similarity of the informations and no signal is emitted.  Your system and any intellectual property regime based on the copying of information only makes any fucking sense in an imaginary universe where some recognizable signal is emitted when someone copies something, such that you can receive that signal and act upon it.  You have imagined a system based upon information which is not presently available; your system might as well begin "whenever someone thinks of an elephant.."

Think about it this way: When the blockchain forked recently, the 51% "attack" was instead the 51% *solution to the problem*-- get everyone onto mining a chain that makes sense, get that chain to be the longest, phew, problem solved.  But the definition of what's a "problem" vs a desirable state of the network depends on what you want the chain to say, depends on who you are, depends on what motives you have.  At the moment Bitcoin is by far the largest supercomputer in the world, most of the hash power is in trustworthy pools, and the network is probably entirely safe.
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:42:40
What?  They're thinking they can actually get away with this?!  I thought this was just a clever civil disobedience stunt, where they go through the motions of unveiling an easy way to buy BTC, forcing the government to come in and play the big meanie who doesn't want people to play with the fun toy for no good reason it can coherently admit to.  Anyway even if they're so naive as to be actually trying to get it through it'll still have its most important salutary effect: Keeping up from having to suffer years into the future of people whining "why not just make a Bitcoin ATM."

Yeah that's how I would expect bitcoin to be sold mostly is you buy a paper wallet.  Or rather even you just buy a URL and passphrase to a site where you can choose what address to send the balance to. 
There's all this antiquated stuff around about how to make a "secure" bitcoin transaction in person with these complicated schemes.  Maybe once that was necessary or useful but it's not where we're headed.  A more useful sort of "secure" could be obtained by making sure the seller *does* have a copy of the private keys to the wallets they sell, so they're not lost if you lose/destroy the paper before you manage to transfer the coins. 
If I was a retailer I wouldn't even stop at 1 BTC (unless I was retailing to some super upscale neighborhood I guess!?) I would also go right ahead and sell bitcents, or at least like 5 bitcent for $2.

But your transactions are limited to human speed.  That's secure but very limiting.  People able to secure full computers will have their computers automatically reselling their resources or trading a zillion currencies to balance their portfolios, while people whose security is an idiot proof box that refuses to release any coins unless they press a physical button won't be able to do anything at all unless they press a physical button.  We should have secure devices like that for some purposes of course but they're not enough for your whole life.  People need to be able to securely use a full powerful computer or they can't keep up with the modern world.

Well shit.  You know, I don't think most potential bitcoin users care about the theoretical aspects of the currency.  They care whether bitcoin can beat credit cards' ground game and make it easier for them to make a fucking payment.  If things start to be available in their countries in bitcoin **NOW** and with credit cards "in the coming weeks" then you are not going to have to give them a speech about why they should get some bitcoin. 
On the other hand, as little as I like states or corporations, I disagree with this attitude here that these specific advantages on the ground will automatically translate into a complete win for bitcoin overall.  What it means is just that those status quo players must adapt, they must compete.  And they will.  They are going to have to lower charges, lower barriers, change their game.  They are going to have to lobby to have the legal restrictions that advantage bitcoin changed immediately.  I bet they'll even make their own cryptocurrencies and burn their capital marketing them, as a last defense.  They'll do what they have to to maintain the value of their investments; this is the beginning of the war and not the end. 
But while there's no guarantee that bitcoin will win, it's certain that merely by having to compete at all the credit card companies and Paypal will lose hard, because their payments monopolies will be irrevocably broken.  The guaranteed winner here is the ordinary internet consumer.
@_date: 2013-05-17 13:14:07


This is often repeated but not at all true.  Bitcoins exist only in a virtual world.  They are imagined into being by the Bitcoin network.  No numbers are scarce.  A number cannot of course be scarce, a number can be copied.  If a Bitcoin were a number, you could easily copy it.  A Bitcoin is a virtual object, an abstraction, like a particular glider in Conway's Game of Life.  Usually such abstractions can also be easily copied, and you can indeed easily make a Bitcoin network on which you are very rich, but you cannot get anyone to believe that your Bitcoin network is the real one simply because you do not have an exaflop of computing power.  That's what's clever about Bitcoin is that it's the first virtual world which you can't easily copy or mimic or fake because it goes along every ten minutes starting with a zillion zeros. 
This is what it feels like to be uploaded to the web. 
Up until right now, everything on the internet was entirely meaningless, one big mush.  I mean the content was fine, here I am writing this thing and there's some information value to it.  But now that I've written it and posted it it just goes up into this mush, and you can't actually know now whether I posted this as my original thought just now or whether this is a copy of something someone else said somewhere else.  Indeed you can copy this right this instant and post it on some other forum somewhere as coming from you and all we'll have to tell them apart is their timestamps from two different random untrusted computers that even if trustworthy wouldn't even tell us whether this really originated with a third source.  So if you post something to the web it's just part of the whole blob of the thing, it's uploaded to archive.org and Google spiders it and the NSA copies it to their fancy new data center but nobody really honestly knows where the fuck it came from or when, it's just some newly discovered junk for the junkpile. 
If you do something on the Bitcoin network it's different.  When you send bitcoin it matters.  You can make another version an hour later where you keep the bitcoin and do something else with it, but you can't make enough zeros to put on it to make anyone give a shit about that version.  The exaflop of zero making computers have moved on, they have given an unmovable solidity to what you really did, and they have marked that occurrence with reliable evidence as to *when* it occurred. 
Bitcoin is a real trustworthy story about things that happened in our universe.  This is what it feels like to be uploaded to the web.  Not just writing some words that get thrown on the pile, but actually doing something so that something actually *happens* on the web, something real and solid, something for the history books. 
After a while you'll start to realize that what was so special about offline things wasn't that they smell nice, though that's great too, what's really quite special about them is that they're real.  Real things have this amazing quality to them where they just sit there.  It's not amazing until you've had some time in a crazy wonderland like today's web where there's spinning infinite copypasta repetitions of everything, but exposed to this nonsense you quickly crave reality.  It just sits there.  You can't make more of it, just move it around, and it's always somewhere in particular.  Bitcoin's like that.  Bitcoin's real.  Welcome to the web, this is what it feels like to be uploaded.

That sounds like an awesome plan, that really would work very well even though you were kidding.  The system at Rainbow Gatherings, which are the "state of the future" if anything is, is that at dinner time a bunch of people go around dancing and singing and they have a giant hat in which people can give money if they want.  The money goes towards providing any infrastructure necessary for the village that people didn't bring on their own-- historically a lot of it has gone to water piping, walkie-talkies for medical and security volunteers, and rounding out the supplies of medicine and food, such as making sure there's plenty of fruit after the ceremony on the 4th since that's traditional.  There is no entrance fee, no external funding, no involuntary taxation of any kind, the community's self-governance is entirely funded by that hat passing.  So of course after the first few times people stopped contributing and the whole experiment failed-- just kidding, it's been going for decades now, stop by any of the many Gatherings coming up this summer and let your family care for you!

Um OK well I'm glad you're finally considering this important question about society.  You're almost there.  The "means of production" is a more specific term than simply combining the meanings of its constituent words; it does not simply mean things which produce things.  The means of production is specifically the basic fundamental material that's essentially necessary to create society.  For instance the arable land without which no one can have food, the mines and quarries without which no one can have minerals and materials, the springs without which no one can have fresh water, etc. 
Try to imagine the position in society of a person or institution or group which has control of literally *all* of the world's arable land or drinkable water.  It doesn't matter what anyone else has, does it?  They have to give it up to this group that owns the food or water, because they need food and water more than that group needs anything they have.

It's not my idea!  I know nothing about it!  I'm no expert in arbitrage, just from my limited understanding that's the ordinary way to do it.  You place a buy on one market and a sell on the other at the spread prices, simultaneously.  Then you just occasionally even out the accounts if most of the trades go one direction and they get out of balance.  I guess.  I bet there are books and stuff about how arbitrage works, personally if I was seriously getting into that difficult financial business I would read some of those first and figure out what I was doing.

It seems your broad assertion that socialists "are insistent on" this idea of yours is not actually true.  It's not true in my case.  It's not true in the case of any of the anarchist socialists I know, and I do know many personally and have discussed this subject with them.  Has *anyone* told you that they themselves *do* believe this thing you're saying?  Or have you just heard this wild idea about the states of mind or the assertions or the insistences of socialists from people who are *not* themselves socialists and don't know or trust any socialists or know anything about them?

The idea that people "voluntarily agree" to be totally ruled over is as absurd as the contention of the drug agents that people on buses "voluntarily agree" to have their bags searched for cocaine.  Look if it's voluntary people have to have the choice not to do it.  It's as simple as that.  If the people voluntarily working the way you want at your factory decide to work differently, they may, because that's how voluntary works.  The may voluntarily remove *you* if you have a problem with how they want to live their own lives. 
If it's voluntary we can make sure of that every once in a while with an open public meeting where if people say that it wasn't voluntary at all it fucking changes.

One thing you'll be able to do with that ฿0.02 pretty soon is to *color* it, making it into a distinct class of coin which can be traded independently from Bitcoin itself while still making use of all of the Bitcoin network's convenience and security.  In other words you'll be able to turn it into (at least) *twenty million* tokens which can have their own value for other reasons than the value of bitcoin itsellf-- as tokens in a game, as stock in a company, as an alternate currency, etc.

Or you could buy them by giving people anything else of value, perhaps something of genuine or lasting value.  But if all you have is fiat the most efficient thing is just to sell it to someone nearby.  They don't dare impose any of these regulatory barriers on personal transactions (AKA banning cash) so those are still low friction.  Anyway anyone who has "large amounts" of fiat from this fucked up economy should just give it back to who they stole it from.

But as long as I get to be publicly humiliated first of course it's fine then, I mean being put in a cage is the least I deserve for not paying you money, right?  Heck, I don't even need the right to present my own facts and explanations about the case, just please have a judge decide whether what happened from my perspective is or isn't "admissible" and I'll happily go along with that because how could it be unfair if a judge decided it, right?

Fiat's not my favorite thing in the world so it's not really what I'd prefer people buy with their coin, but practically speaking it's a very reasonable purchase for a lot of people short-term.  All of this buying and selling fiat for cryptocurrencies has opened up this giant channel connecting the old and new economies that lots of people are finding really useful at the moment.  I actually think it would be best for Bitcoin if *everyone* was always open to either buying and selling BTC, at a reasonable spread, at least in cash to their friends and family and acquaintances-- then anyone can cash in and out anywhere anytime.  What most Bitcoin users most want now is a big broad connection with fiat so that they can immediately interface Bitcoin with the rest of their current financial lives.

People only need old currency to pay expenses for the next few months or whatever until their inputs are available for bitcoin, so who cares?  That's just a slight impediment to it all sliding away *immediately*.  I mean yes, obviously someone has to be the *first* to accept it, and *they* can't pay their expenses directly in bitcoin.  But the *first* merchants are already there-- they are selling virtual services, or cupcakes, or overpriced beer, all of which you can see how that would work fine.  So I mean yes that's a sensible argument for why Bitcoin can't transition *immediately* to being the main currency of the world.  It already hasn't transitioned immediately and won't today or tomorrow.  It had exactly that problem where no one was accepting it because no one else was accepting it, and that lasted for a while and it was worth six cents.  It's over now.  Now it has a brief period where there's *only* thousands of merchants all over the world who accept it, not already *all* of the inputs for all manufacturing businesses.  But give it a couple more weeks eh.

Yes.  Also: They could change the rules in *any other way*.  They could make bitcoins randomly appear and disappear.  They could make transfer fees depend on the phase of the moon.  They could switch it from having exact numbers to having vague descriptions of people's balances.  They could make it into an image board with pictures of cute cats.  The limit of what can actually be done is indeed a political question of what is "really" still Bitcoin.  Also: No amount of hashing power or any amount of *anything* can stop anyone else from continuing to run another chain that seems to them and other people like it's "really" Bitcoin.

That's a known property of the system and is also considered a feature.

No one knows.  I guess yes, it'll probably go up to $1000, there's not enough competition.  But that's a wild guess.  I think the key to the answer is to watch Litecoin.  If it's possible for new currencies to enter the market then there will be lots of them; if Litecoin succeeds then neither Bitcoin nor Litecoin are worth *very* much; that puts some ceiling on it.  The million dollar bitcoin number is actually very realistic if the nature of the network effect is to completely exclude other systems, but I don't see why that should be the case. 
Nota Bene: The *entire world* is changing dramatically in various ways.  Bitcoin is a symptom, not the cause.  Welcome to the Singularity!  Even if bitcoins do become tremendously valuable over the next few years, that will still not necessarily be a very important event compared to everything else which will also be happening.  People here think that because it's remarkable that bitcoin is changing so much, it is a unique or rare opportunity, but this is not the case; this is what happens to *everything* during a Singularity.  There are many many opportunities for everyone to invest in all kinds of things that become remarkable or otherwise to do things that dramatically change the world.

For a lot of average Redditors, the advantage of Bitcoin that gets them involved with it is that it's easy to tip it to them with the tip bot.  Tools like that make it ridiculously easy to get involved and it's only going to get easier. 
People will do things that are entirely made of Bitcoin and couldn't happen without Bitcoin, without them even necessarily being called "Bitcoin" or seeming like currency exchanges.  For instance someone might set you up an account and say "you log into it like this," so it just seems like an ordinary internet account, there's no buying or selling anything.  But it turns out how it works internally is by staking some Bitcoin (to prevent spamming and other abuse) and signing a statement with that Bitcoin key to login. 
You're going to see donation addresses and buttons spread all over the web so very soon, to every little tiny blog and channel, because it doesn't cost anything so not having a donation address on your stuff is basically throwing away money, eh?!  Even if only a tiny percentage of your readers are using Bitcoin the costs are so low that it's already foolish not to take the free money, and it gets more unreasonable every day.

Hmm, how could you get people to keep a balance on it, hmm, game theory, hmm.  OK, how's this: When you negative tip someone, you only get half of the negative tip, the rest is distributed proportionally to everyone keeping a balance in the negative tip system, um, proportionate to both how much they have in the system and how much they've posted lately, they have to have some vulnerability.

Diluting the holdings of people with a lot of bitcoin is obviously advantageous to everyone except those very people, no?  I'm only holding 15 mBTC presently so the fact that people holding a bunch of BTC stand to get part of the benefit of anything I contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't seem like a plus to me!?  That's more of a reason for supporting the alternative ecosystems unless you're already an early adopter of this one. 
I agree there's no particularly valuable advantages to the alternate blockchains that exist-- but that's figured into their current prices!!  A litecoin is selling for just ฿0.0025!!  So the question isn't whether they're just as valuable as a bitcoin-- hardly anyone or no one thinks that-- the question posed by the market at the moment is whether or not FOUR HUNDRED TIMES LESS is a fair valuation.  Even if you think a litecoin is *even less* valuable than that, can you really say that it has no value at all?  Is a litecoin not worth a single satoshi?

I don't own substantial amounts of any cryptocurrency (or any asset at all, really).  Bitcoin being open source does not mean that it can incorporate all the strengths of all other systems.  Bitcoin can only change its protocol when there is a consensus about how to change it.  For instance even if it were broadly agreed at some point in history that Bitcoin would benefit from printing some extra coin, many people have promised that may not be done without a fork.  Or for another instance I think it would be fantastically difficult to get a consensus to change the bitcoin protocol to add more fees.  On the other hand, new systems can be built with any new inflation/deflation processes or fee structures that are convenient to any need.

By that logic you should be kicking yourself even *more* for not buying *litecoins*, which were at $0.06 in January and today are trading at $0.80.  Hindsight is 20/20.  It's actually very hard to predict which of bitcoins or litecoins or your favorite stock are going to perform best over the next year.  It's not hard though to bet *against* fiat; the chances of any sort of innovation or change of policy that could markedly increase the value of fiat currency in the next year are really very near nil.  If you're sitting on any fiat at all, toss that hot potato and buy yourself a real asset!!  Bitcoin's a fine choice.

That seems to me like almost a reductio that that can't be right, there *must* be more than half a million dollars going in a day, and many or perhaps even most miners hold, so that means someone's cashing out.  But *of course* someone's cashing out.  The price is currently $115ish, but it dipped well under $100 recently where it was mostly bought by speculators.  How many people who snagged some for $60 hoping to make a profit are going to refuse to take double their money because they're holding out for $250 again, right?! :O

I've been thinking about the barriers left to exchanging bitcoin efficiently for telecommuting labor, using it to pay people to think about things and do things with computers.  I think there's some space to invent ways to work with and for one another that are really new, not just simple translations of existing money flows.  If the delivered product itself is also digital, is an information product (by which I mean of course actual valuable fresh information, not just copypasta'd "intellectual property") then there isn't even that last friction of shipping to restrain it.  I imagine the whole system could really start to hum. :)

Fees on the Bitcoin network are kinda in a funny place.  The way the fee structure works is that there's a maximum amount of transactions that fits in a block, and so miners are going to put the most valuable transactions before they put ones with a lower fee or nothing, right?  They get the fees, so they'll mostly want to do the transactions with good fees.  But there aren't actually enough transactions to fill all of the blocks all the time!  So you'll still get in pretty soon even if you don't put a fee at all.  Mostly the miners aren't mean enough to exclude cheap or free transactions to try to make people pay-- they get paid a bunch still from the block reward, anyway, so they're happy with that.  A small fee is probably still a good idea to ensure none of your transactions are stuck a long time in limbo, which is generally harmless but can be mildly stressful!  Myself I've been putting a ฿0.0002/kb fee, which today is a little more than two cents.

You don't have to make a blockchain transaction in order to transact something denominated in a cryptocurrency.  For instance the bot makes free off-chain transactions.  Blockchains just provide the service of making a permanent public neutral record of a transaction, at a rather fantastically low price really.  Also most of the other chains currently have lower fees than Bitcoin, so that's something else to consider. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:25:31
That certainly isn't the most efficient use of those resources.  What the Bitcoin network requires and buys from miners is quick hashing.  That's it, just running a hashing algorithm over pretty much the same data a zillion times.  The best computers for that are ASICs and because of the economics there's no reason any computers except the very most efficient should profit at all. 
Your network does have other strengths.  It's somewhat resilient and somewhat private and somewhat secure.  The most effective way to figure out what your network would be useful for would be to sell your company to its employees.  If the employees owned and controlled the equipment they would of course figure out efficient interesting ways to profit from it.  The reason they're not bothering is that they know any profit would just go to you anyway and not to benefit them or humanity generally so they're doing the minimum they can get away with to comply with your oppressive bullshit.

My thought is that that article adds little to the conversation.  I suppose I could bother to rebut it. 
You have to **trust** that anyone will accept Bitcoins for payment-- no you don't!?  The system works fine between anyone who wants to participate and it doesn't matter who doesn't!? 
You have to **trust** unregulated exchanges-- no you don't, that's just a way to sell fiat online that has little to do with Bitcoin. 
You have to **trust** that the Bitcoin code does what it clearly says it does, that is, if you don't speak C++-- pretty much applicable to any information in any language so I'm not sure what their point is there. 
You have to **trust** that people won't make alternative cryptocurrencies-- no, there are alternative cryptocurrencies and that's fine.
You have to **trust** that governments won't intervene-- yeah because when governments make things illegal they just totally instantly disappear, that's what I fucking remember from history, wtf. 
You have to **trust** Satoshi-- this author does understand that it's open source, right? 
You have to **trust**-- the exchanges again, didn't we already do this one?  No, you don't.
You have to **trust** yourself to keep the keys secure.  There!  They hit one!  That is true.  In order to trust Bitcoin, you have to trust yourself to keep a secret.  That's it.  That's what you need to trust.  I'll grant them this: It's true that trusting yourself, empowering yourself, can be very difficult.

You can think in µBTC if you like.  Then there's just two digits after the dot, like dollars and cents.  But you still have to get used to the fact that numbers are pretty high at the moment, since you can buy 86.20 µBTC for a penny.  It's really just a different system with different information that requires building a whole different intuition.  When I started to understand it it gave me flashbacks to the slow process of building up an intuition about old fashioned currency when I was little.  Really if you take a step back all of that business about pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters being all different random sizes and values and learning to put them together to make arbitrary amounts is a *lot* more to learn.  But you already *know* all that, when Bitcoin is new to you, and you have to become a child again to take in just a few more new strange things.

Hmm, theoretically you could trust some person or agent to hold some money for you and mediate your purchases.  It would be hard to keep you from laundering your own money out somehow, though, since BTC is so good at that.  And you'd have to figure out who you could trust.  But I think we could easily create systems that would work *better* for you than this is at the moment.  I'm not sure exactly how it could work but we should start trying to figure it out!

*Bitcoin* will never be the only thing.  Some people around here think that Bitcoin will necessarily triumph *entirely* somehow over Litecoin and any other possible alternative.  I don't see any sense to that.  Litecoin is already successfully being used as a currency and nothing's happening to it right now.  I think that's just a fantasy of how rich they could be for owning Bitcoin-- if it took over *everything* they would be *really* rich, and they like thinking about that. 
Cryptocurrencies in general could keep being the main currency for a long time into the future.  Or not, it's hard to say.  One thing that could compete with them would be centralized electronic systems-- if/when the governments give up on prohibiting electronic currency, the extra work the decentralized systems go through to be uncensorable might no longer seem worth it. 
But I think the most likely outcome is that centralized electronic currencies will be mostly pegged to cryptocurrencies, which will be seen as a more trustworthy store of value.  This is the case for instance right now with the infamous Silk Road.  Silk Road transactions aren't conducted on the blockchain (where there would be a public record!), they're just internal to the Dread Pirate Roberts' system, while the real coins dance around pretending to be other meaningless transactions until it's time for someone to withdraw them.  So really transactions there are in a centralized electronic currency that's pegged to the BTC (or actually, interestingly enough, apparently it's pegged to a three day moving average of the MTGox price)!

I'm in Vermont but let me know how I can help.  Bitcoin is much more effective as a way of protesting the banks than our previous strategies.  Personally I'm here for the revolution, and so I'd prefer teaching one person who's in this to deeply alter the system to a dozen who are here because it's a neato gizmo (or to a thousand who are here because it might go up in value). 
This is the strategy I'd suggest for a group of people who mostly don't have the equipment or knowledge to directly use Bitcoin, but who want to have a Bitcoin market symbolically: The people who do understand Bitcoin could print out a bunch of paper wallets (a paper wallet could be designed to the theme of the event), each with a milli on them (a millibit, a millibitcoin, a mBTC, worth about $0.12 today).  They'd then start the market going by selling people those (today I'd price them two for a quarter or 17 for $2) or by making initial purchases with them. 
At the end of the event the wallets would be kept by whoever wanted them as a souvenir (and/or to get some BTC!), or the people who issued them could promise to buy them back in the (unlikely) event that there's more of them than people want to keep. 
That's one thing that's beautiful about cryptocurrency is our ability to print money with our own [new aesthetic visions]( :D

You might be telling the truth but the fifty more people who would post similar stories tomorrow still wouldn't be.  We all try to be as generous as we're able with whatever funds we have, but we *have* to give out tips only in exchange for things that are **valuable or otherwise difficult to produce**.

You can follow the money on the blockchain until *someone* does something publicly identifiable with it, but there's no reason to think that person is the same person who stole the money (and it wouldn't be very wise of the thief if it was).  The first transactions will just look like scattering the coins down chains of fresh one-time-use anonymous wallets-- the BTC equivalent of money laundering, except it's ridiculously easy. ;)
In theory we could change the protocol to allow us to mark tainted coin and we could all refuse to accept it ever again.  But in my opinion that would be a lot of work for little reward.  It's not as if it would stop people from stealing or otherwise being terrible with money-- even if the BTC someone's giving you have a perfectly pristine history, they probably just bought them on the street for dirty cash.

There's a few Bitcoin addresses slipping out onto the normal blogosphere these days.  But hey, you should check out the dark web!  It's like a vision of the future.  I'd never gone there until a couple of weeks ago because I was like, meh, it's some work to bring up a [different browser]( and find sites I'm not familiar with and child porn isn't my thing so why should I bother, right?  But when I went there and started poking around, it's a revelation. 
That's one thing about it is that there's a Bitcoin address on everything.  There's no currency accepted anywhere for anything except Bitcoin.  Maybe Litecoin here and there, but certainly not the silly flimsy money of the surface world.  They discuss fiat money mostly in terms of selling sketchy forms of it like skimmed cards for much smaller amounts of real money! 
Yeah it's only a moment now until there's a donation address on everything.  If people put that whole line of buttons injecting all that chaos into their designs just to try to get reshares on various social networks, how much more motivated they'll be to put the new buttons that actually give them immediate money.  I don't know how long it'll take to overtake Google ads in revenue, but I think it'll only take half a moment to win away everyone's *loyalty*.  Direct micropayments is what we [always]( wanted the web to be; going through advertisers was a brief bizarrely inefficient detour.

Basically you can trust only what's *specifically* said in the signed statement.  Like if you say in a signed statement that the account coqui33 on Reddit is yours, that probably means it is, but it could have been hacked recently.  Unless you include a newspaper headline or something that establishes a date, it's not even enough to establish recentness, so it could have been signed any time.  If you just sign a statement saying generally "I'm coqui33!" then I could sign up for an account named coqui33 somewhere else and use it.  It has to be exactly as specific as what you're trying to establish: Just signing the name "coqui33" is enough if ALL you want to establish is that that bitcoin address has heard of "coqui33" somehow.  If you want to establish when, you have to sign some recent new information.  If you want to establish that you are in genuine communication with someone, you have to sign their recent statements.  For instance consider the class of attacks that can be foiled by having someone sign a statement specifically saying "Please do not sign this statement unless you are the real coqui33, as someone is requesting on Reddit that I believe they aren't just relaying these messages to you and tricking you into signing them!!" :O

Did you follow the instructions at and say accept and have it make you a wallet?  There's a wallet made for you by the bot, that you have joint control over.  You can send transfers from that account either by asking the bot to send them for you or by asking the bot for a password for a blockchain.info account that has access to the account your tip funds are in.  Bitcoin accounts aren't like bank accounts, because they're completely free and unregulated, they're not rationed like that, so you have to develop a different intuition about them.

Going on general principle you'd think it would be, because if something is more expensive in BTC than in USD then there would appear to be money left on the table.  But on the other hand, if those opportunities *had* all been taken then you would presently be able to buy just about anything at a reasonable price in bitcoin, which is actually not at all the case, is it??  People complain about how there's not much you can buy with bitcoin, as if that were a problem rather than an opportunity. ;)  It's my theory that there *actually is* a fantastic amount of money being left on the table.  Take for instance this successful operation right now selling pizza for bitcoin, at a substantial markup.  Their rates are so high there's probably still room for someone else to enter *that* niche, and there's plenty of others untouched.

I don't think it's very comparable to a stock really.  Or a commodity.  It's a new category.  It could get to huge valuations like that because of the lack of competition.  At the moment there's nowhere else online for the money to go.  If the competition stayed this weak BTC could get to $200,000 easy.  It won't of course, just because that's an incredible incentive to try to compete with it.  Colored coins are my bet for what'll take the lion's share of it; Bitcoin's best competition is Bitcoin.

PPCoin is centralized, isn't it?  Of course you can save yourself the cost of requiring hashes by centralizing.  I'm not sure why anyone's impressed by that. 
How would making people submit a proof of work with transactions help anything?  We can already confirm that someone wants to make a transaction with their key.  What do we confirm by making them work?  That they *really* want to make a transaction?  I really don't see the point. 
It seems like an interesting class of systems to have interconnected chains, lots of people are talking about that and suggesting what it could be useful for, but I don't see how it's obvious that it saves resource use over Bitcoin.  How is that obvious?  Maybe you could a more complex system with more dynamics in it for a similar cost, I guess that could be considered a lower cost per chain or something, is that what you mean? 
It can't have no costs at all.  The costs aren't incidental.  They're what weighs down the system so it has any stability.  Whatever the system is you come up with, if you're successful in what you're saying you're trying to do you're saying I should be able to say about it: "This is a great system!  It has this thing in it that has all this value, yet it doesn't have any cost!"  What?  *Why* would that thing be valuable?  Whatever it is, I can produce more of it for free!!  I can make another chain that's just as secure, for free!  The value of that is very very low.  There are a lot of ways to make relatively secure records of things that they're useless as currency because there's no reason to trust or value them.

I agree that it's a somewhat less violent way to extract money from people than armed robbery, but that it's a gentler means of collection is not the character of the argument in these parts.

You can't invent a new mineral, choose its color &amp; shininess &amp; rarity &amp; etc., and have it compete with gold.  Bitcoin is a particular brand name, associated with a particular network protocol, which some people value and advocate for and work within.  It has to compete against other very similar systems based on resources that are similar to those that differentiate stock bearing corporations, like personnel and culture and brand awareness. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:57:49
But *that's* actually wasting resources.  If they charge a fee it's the same cost to the user *and* they get paid.  That represents a genuine efficiency!  That's what Bitcoin is good for, is putting a cost on things so we can stop being gamed.  The cost is real but it's only within the Bitcoin physics and not the physics of this external world.  We get to transfer processes that used to cost real energy into existing in a solid secure virtual space so they can be essentially free in real energy.  It's a device with real, transformative applications.  Or we could just play around with it and see how much people feel like buying it for, I guess, whatever. :/

It seems like a bunch of people all around the world have been tempted by this opportunity simultaneously, which is certainly a dangerously unstable situation but seems to happen to be working out fine.  I think a lot of people here forget that hindsight is 20/20 and think that people were necessarily fools for not buying a bunch of early bitcoins for pennies.  Really maybe if you zoom out and look at more possible worlds maybe they're the wise ones.  Maybe most of the time if you try to start a network like Bitcoin in a society like ours someone makes ASICs ahead of everyone else and crushes the system.  Maybe people who bought bitcoins for pennies actually got lucky on a bad bet!! 
Or maybe not. :)  Maybe this incentive structure works to gradually pull in more and more mining power along with an increasing currency valuation and that makes sense.  One might expect then that other cryptocurrencies will emerge in the same way.  Or it could be that you can only do it once.  Can you start another chain and gradually build it on that same sort of trajectory, but alongside Bitcoin as an older sibling?  Maybe other chains with other algorithms can pull in first people's home computers, then some big computers and botnets as they grow a little, and then have ASICs rolled out to match them and officially join the club.  It's a more competitive situation, but also a bit of a trodden path. 
Anyway soon the hashrate for Bitcoin should be so fantastically ridiculous that we can really finally feel safe to stop having this conversation over and over. ;)

Their argument is really just that we need to have government to decide for us because we're greedy, but we don't have to worry about tyranny because we'll have complete control of the government.

Could reputation rating perhaps be orthogonal to each of these projects?!  We seem to be building a new ad hoc reputation system for each marketplace we try to establish.  That's not working very well and it makes it hard to start new market systems because there's people trying to control each market with network effects to leverage rent out of the reputation data they happen to have.  We should have a reputation system that just does that, just reputation, about various stuff.

Bitcoin is an illegal project.  It was always illegal.  It was totally made by hackers.  Not black hats but not white hats either.  Firmly grey hat.  I do not know of a country in the world that Satoshi could have been a citizen where it could have been a legal act to print a new currency with the explicit intent of devaluing government currencies and thereby devaluing (or even entirely destroying) government.  I dunno maybe that's legal in Finland, maybe Satoshi's Finnish.  Anyway putting "hacker" and "illegal" prominently in a discussion of this censorship resistant currency we hacked together after they actually did legally suppress all our earlier attempts is spot fucking on.  It was illegal and we did it and we won.

It's only a long-term threat (long-term in this context meaning you'd get whole *months* of warning) because part of what makes a cryptocurrency valuable is trust, which can only be built over time.  You can instantly build a system tomorrow that's ten times better than Bitcoin in ten different ways, and we still can't just switch our whole financial system to it tomorrow.  Maybe a little further into the Singularity we'll be that brave but not yet. :/ 
In my opinion yes it's true that alt coins should be able to take some market share away from Bitcoin.  On the other hand, the market is going to expand really fast, and there are only at most a few other coins that could be considered trustworthy at all.  A bunch of value probably will spill over into the junk coins, in absolute terms, millions and millions of dollars, but the bulk of the value has to go through Bitcoin and Litecoin and maybe one or two others. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:46:26
Forks aren't like a new discovery or something, they're a basic element of the system that's discussed in every fundamental explanation of it.  This recent fork was resolved pretty quickly; how could it have gone any better than it did?  To me it does show that multiple currencies is a good and likely strategy long-term, but it certainly doesn't show that bitcoin is presently valueless.  The whole South Korean old-fashioned banking system just had a similarly sized hiccup!!  But people are certainly going to keep using it-- they live in South Korea and they need to buy stuff.  Similarly, the world of Bitcoin grinds on. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:47:15
It's very clever marketing.  I don't mind that so much as I mind the false regulatory barriers they actually use to keep control of their market.  But now the jig is up so whatever! :) 
A cryptocurrency bank is actually pretty easy to make and there already are plenty of them, but they have a different psychological problem.  They could easily make investments and give a reasonable rate of return on them to their depositors.  The problem is, the depositors deposited *bitcoin* which is still crazily undervalued.  If you give people a steady 3% or something in real return, but during the same period bitcoin climbs 200% for whatever reason, then people's balances displayed in BTC have halved and they aren't very happy with that bank right now!! :O  It doesn't help much that when bitcoin crashes to half its value the same account would double in bitcoin terms-- double plus 3%!!-- because no one's thinking about that other side of the coin when they feel like their money was just halved.  Maybe someone would take that deal just because it would be *rational* to-- maybe a *few* people, if you're lucky. ;) 
So there are a zillion bitcoin banks (mostly under other names-- "games" and "casinos" and "illegal drug marketplaces" and "currency exchanges") but they still all just keep your money 100% invested in bitcoin.  I think a reasonable first step to breaking that pattern would be if places would let you choose how much of your balance to keep in bitcoin and how much in litecoin.  But maybe that just means I'm a Litecoin fanboy. ;)  We'll see what happens, now that there's actually something approaching a free market in banking services.

Yes that's fine, someone can be scared of volatility.  That by itself makes some sense.  But now combine it with the other scenario that I'm saying contradicts that, which is the idea of people being unwilling to let go of any bitcoin because they know it's deflationary.  Put them together and look at them side by side, that's where there's a contradiction.  You've got this business where you're too afraid to use or accept Bitcoin because it's so volatile, OK fine.  Meanwhile you're also amassing a hoard of bitcoin that you refuse to spend because it's getting so valuable.  Huh??  You're hoarding it because it's too valuable to spend.  But also, you *refuse* to accept any *more*-- too volatile!  WHICH IS IT?

Thanks!  I think this thread was fairly productive overall, even if there was no particular stroke of genius struck-- hey, you can't win them all. 
Here's another synthesis I thought of while rereading the thread: How about wearing a recycle symbol button (which I assume is fairly widely available) and also next to it a Bitcoin button.  That way we don't have to put a new product into production with a new symbol, we can just combine those two existing symbols. 
That'd also make it easy to add buttons for other cryptocurrencies, maybe even other smart property.  Like you could have a recycle/exchange pin, a Bitcoin pin, and a pin for some game, meaning that you'll trade items from that game for Bitcoin.  So you could see that person's pins and say "oh, hey, will you buy this +3 Sword of Awesomeness from me, then?"  Or whatever!

Um, so?  You can't tell from the addresses how many coins are controlled by which agents.
@_date: 2013-05-14 06:22:00
Bitcoins cannot be counterfeited because they exist only in a virtual world which is very secure because it is enforced by thousands of nodes simultaneously, nodes which only accept requests to change the inside of the virtual world if those requests are *both* perfectly formed to respect the virtual world's internal physics and *also* accompanied by a series of hashes so low that they are extraordinarily difficult to find.  This ensures that the public consensus of what is happening in the virtual Bitcoin world is valid very *quickly* (having it be accurate eventually isn't nearly as tricky). 
The system knows almost nothing about what's going on in our world.  It has little it can trust.  It can trust only signed statements, and with those it can only trust exactly what they prove: That some agent somewhere that wanted to sign that statement was in control of the relevant *secret*.  The secret must be secret from *everyone* but the owner of the coins, even the cryptocurrency system itself, as control of the secret is identical with control of the coins.  The system sees only the public keys associated with the secrets, and signed statements which can be verifiably associated with those public keys. 
What's on the physical bitcoins is a secret.  It could be anything.  It's usually a standard format number (it has letters in it, but just because it's a higher than ten base number, it's just a random number).  But it could be any secret, any information.  It could be just a sequence of random words under the hologram as the secret.  You'd just need a standard way to turn the words into the right size number to be a key (which there is, the brainwallet standard). 
Calling it a "physical bitcoin" is just a shorthand or metaphor.  What it contains isn't a bitcoin, it's a secret associated with an address.  You can deposit more into the address associated with a coin and then the coin will be holding more bitcoin.  From the Bitcoin network's perspective it has no idea what a physical coin is and it couldn't believe you if you told it you have one.  It believes you want to transfer bitcoin if and only if you know the right secret.

(From a Bitcoin perspective Kickstarter is a solution in search of a problem.)  And even as I was thinking that, was collecting these funds for this flash mob, without even saying and perhaps without even *knowing* yet that's what the funds were for. 
I thought I grokked the internet.  I got used to anything happening completely instantly, so I thought that meant I was ready for anything.  But Bitcoin *still* goes faster than my intuition allows for.  It somehow allows things to *already have been happening* long before any of the people involved even understand at all what's going on.

The internet could share a lot more.  There's a lot of talk about how it's sharing, but the truth is that it was just sharing a surface level of really cheap things.  Everyone has been all buying their own connections to the internet and their own servers to do stuff here and it's been all very unfair.  We can make more spaces on the internet that are fairer, with new internal rules.  Bitcoin is a sort of space like that, not that it's really fair but it plays by its own rules, fair or not they're different.  You can buy more servers to mine more bitcoins but you can't just buy more servers to control more of the bitcoin already trading.  So it's not detached from money generally but it's detached from the physical infrastructure in that certain way.  And that lets us share here on a level that's more substantial, because it starts to cut more generally into the substance of things, by being more substantive it has more force to touch things.  We can work from here to make new strong real internal internet spaces with rules that are fair, are distributive, are just, are equitable, are reasonable, spaces that make us feel human again and alive, where we can all survive.  I think it could, I think you're right.  Is that what you meant?  What do you mean?

Um, no.  It's a technology.  It's a solution to a fundamental problem in distributed systems, the so-called "Byzantine Generals' Problem," that is, the problem of reaching a trustworthy consensus between a network of untrustworthy nodes.  There's an economic model used in the solution, but it's not just there randomly for its own sake, it's used as a tool. 
If you haven't yet it might help you to learn about Namecoin.  Namecoin is a mediocre system in practice, but that's not the point, if you understand how it works you can begin to understand how this is a solution to a very general class of problems.  Namecoin doesn't just use the technology Satoshi invented to reach consensus on coin account balances, it also uses it to reach consensus on a distributed ledger of domain names.  There still have to be coins, because the coins are used to solve the problem of network consensus (they're used to pay miners to secure the ledger), but the coins aren't the main point.  You have missed the main point.

Exporting your account and making a backup in a safe place is a *very* good idea which you shouldn't procrastinate about. ;)  But no, it's not necessary to spend the bitcoin.  You can just send a message to the bot telling the bot to "tip" the bitcoin to a full regular Bitcoin address.  So that could be another address you control, or someone you're buying something from, or a deposit address given to you by an exchange or market, or the address of a person or organization you'd like to donate to.  See [the bitcointip documentation]( (and particularly the examples where the recipient of the tip is "ThisIsABitcoinAddress") for more explanation of how it works. :)

I want more tools to handle collective funds for groups, organizations, projects.  All the tools we have are these very individualistic ideas about keeping *your* personal BTC, maybe a bit of escrow or something so you don't even have to extend trust to your trading partners.  I'd like to see more cooperative tools that help us work together.  Like here's an idea of how an app could work that helps you swarm some money together: Anyone can contribute to an account, but their deposits to the account are kept separately, a certain list of agents can attempt to initiate payments from the aggregated account, when they do a message goes to all of the depositors and asks them if they approve or want to contribute to that payment, if/when enough people agree then that payment goes through just from those people's contributions.  So you swarm your money but can also maintain as much control as you want over it, like I think it would be useful to make a hybrid commitment like "up to ฿0.05 automatically but up to maybe as much as ฿1 if you ask me first."

That's fine, just *admit* that you have no ability to think about it, that you have an emotional block about it because of your childhood.  That's fine.  But it's *pathetic* if you pretend that the half-Dragon-people thing is a rational argument.  It's pathetic to act as if you'd considered both sides, just because you know that rejecting something you don't understand is ignorance.  You don't understand how another system is even possible, and that's fine.  You support this system because it is all you know, that's all.  Don't say "I have a rational argument for this system," just be brave enough to honestly say "I am so scared of the idea of being outside of this system that raised me that I have never seriously considered it, that I *cannot* easily consider it because I cannot understand it."

Thanks, TheDJFC!  My very first bitcoin tip, and it's for a hundredth of an airplane.  I have no idea how I'll be able to afford my taxes this year.  But seriously though I actually do think that a bitcoin will buy you a fancy jet pretty soon-- but then again, that jet will be made entirely by robots, and everyone will be able to afford one!?  So it's hard to say what that really means.  Maybe in the future a few bitcoin will buy you all the jets and applesauce you could ever want, and yet it'd cost you *billions* of bitcoin to buy yourself access to even a mediocre cryptoclub-- IOW, the genuine "fortunes" in today's values that bitcoin hoards amount to also won't be anything next to the ordinary quadrillionaire fortunes of everyone those days.  When the ships start getting back from the asteroids, the amount of gold you can buy for a bitcoin will go through the roof. :)

There are plenty of lists around of bitcoins that are purported to have been stolen.  None of them are particularly trustworthy or used to determine anything important.  Think of the tremendous complications that could be involved in correctly deciding just one case of "stolen" bitcoins where the person who "stole" them claims to have actually fulfilled the contract in question or to have been legitimately authorized to transfer the coins, then multiply that complexity and confusion and drama times infinity.

OK yay thanks.  I've been using these things for fun because I get a value of at least a hundred thousand satoshi worth of amusement whenever I get a payment for dozens of satoshi!  The fantastic absurdity of it is beautiful!! 
Here's my suggestion: Could it pay people for something more valuable than looking at ads?  The ads are usually just ads for other places to get "free" coins so it doesn't seem to me like that could really be a very efficient economy. ;) 
For instance I would pay a mBTC to ask a simple question and have hundreds of people each paid a µBTC to answer it.  It could just say on the faucet like "for an extra µBTC, answer this question" and then put in the question.  Assuming a 10% fee, which I think would be reasonable, when it's asked 900 people the question (paying out 90,000 of the 100,000 satoshi paid by the question submitter) it bundles up the answers and sends them to the agent that submitted that question, then accepts the next question in its queue.

It's not the bitcoin system itself that will restrain the amount of money that flows through it.  Considered in a vacuum or just in relation to the old systems as a thingy that does the function of transporting value, it's worth a whole bunch.  As people here are always fantasizing about it would work fine if satoshi were quite valuable (especially if we subdivided them or at least reduced transaction fees), and the value of being able to move value at all is easily high enough to support such a high valuation of bitcoin if it's still the *only* option for moving money around the world. 
But what *should* happen if things make sense is that the amount of money flowing through bitcoin becomes so much that someone/something else wants to get in and widen the field.  For instance at the moment the valuations of all of the other cryptocurrencies are mostly just plummeting against the bitcoin as it rises.  Fair enough, since bitcoin has functioning systems and those currencies don't.  But are they really worth a *million* times less than a bitcoin?  They *are* similar systems which are also fundamentally useful as tools, even though they don't have as much of an ecosystem around them.  Over time it'll only get easier to add those currencies into open source systems-- why not accept some other coin too if it's just a few lines of code and you can convert them instantly to BTC?  And then why not hold a little of some alternate coins, if your new client supports holding them effortlessly and lots of places are starting to accept them?  They won't be valued anywhere near bitcoin soon but they don't *have* to in order to *compete* just a little and keep the BTC price out of the stratosphere. 
Even if Bitcoin's network effect is too strong for any other network to be valued (which I doubt, really), there are also people working seriously at making "colored coin," particular bitcoins which are recognized by a special kind of client as having special value.  These are traded right on the Bitcoin blockchain, gaining all of the efficiency and security of Bitcoin's scale, but have their own valuations which would only indirectly increase the valuation of uncolored bitcoin.  So this too could provide enough competition to keep the price of Bitcoin reasonable. 
tl;dr: It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  It has to do with when and how any competing systems get into the game and how much of a slice they're able to take.

Bitcoin took off because it's censorship resistant.  The ones before that just considered technical (rather than political) challenges and thought that various degrees of centralization would work fine, and they would work fine except that those systems were all brutally suppressed.  Bitcoin has barely succeeded because it's difficult enough to break, and nothing else can play unless it can stand the weight of government and financial industry heavy weaponry.

Well if you offered anything at all for µBTC your offer would probably be accepted by one of the very first people you offered it to, or one of the first who believed you.  If you offered anything interesting for mBTC you'd be below the market on but there's not much of an audience there so it might still be hard to make sales.  If you somehow reached a lot more people you could get a better price.  IOW *marketing* has a lot more to do with the price you'll get than the intrinsic value of what you're selling.  But marketing can be complex, and lowering your price is simple! ;)  One way or another it should be possible to make the lines cross and get BTC for doing what you are able to do.  This isn't the oldschool bullshit economy where it's impossible to do things.  Here you can do what you want, you can make things work however you want.

What do you mean?  Mixing services don't mix *on* the blockchain.  They mix transactions with one another *off* of the blockchain (in a temporary currency pegged to BTC, is one way to think of it).  All you can see on the blockchain is entry and exit points from such dark pools.  Any service that holds a nominally BTC balance without actually associating it with particular addresses the whole time (most exchanges, market sites, almost everything really) acts as a mixer.  The only difference with things *called* mixers is that they are making a *promise to forget* exchanges that happened internal to their system.

What's being computed is a difficult hash of some transactions, which is useful because then no one (unless they have a supercomputer larger than Bitcoin, which is the largest supercomputer known to exist) can generate a similarly difficult hash of those transactions in time to fool anyone with them. 
There have [been proposals]( to simultaneously use the computation for other things.  That particular proposal I linked only captures a small percentage of the computation, and I believe intuitively that this *must* be the case.  But I can't prove that, and I don't think anyone else has either, so it's *possible* that you can design a cryptocurrency system in which the computation is both an effective and random test and simultaneously useful otherwise-- most likely if someone succeeded in designing such a system it would eventually outcompete Bitcoin entirely. 
There is nothing hidden at all about what takes place on the Bitcoin network and it's pretty much impossible that it is doing any computations other than those we know it is doing.

Some stuff is priced in BTC but it's just annoying!  I saw a Bitcoin Merit Badge earlier today that's priced at one bitcoin.  WTF?  It's $250, no now it costs $75, no it's $120.  They probably chose that price when it was $10 or something that vaguely makes sense for a badge. 
I was going to say that people should price things in gold, but since gold is fucked too I guess people should price their products with an inflation index commodity basket.  Or move to dynamic pricing systems like auctions! :)
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:36:07
I'm not sure what the consequences will be.  It's obviously a different set of expectations in society, a different floor on what's possible. 
For instance we have to consider this pattern when considering whether there will continue to be exchanges between crypto and fiat-- mailing cash through the mail is certainly higher risks and costs than the current exchanges, so it's not a very important market as long as there are cheaper options, but it does provide a solid floor.  People here often imagine scenarios where all exchange between crypto and fiat is successfully banned, but we can be sure at least that they'd have to break through this pattern as well as the aboveground exchanges.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks charge you to make *permanent public records* of transactions.  The fee is very modest for that service.  But you don't have to pay even that fee unless that service is what you need. 
Lots of cryptocurrency denominated transactions, the *vast majority* of them, happen off the block chain.  For instance you might deposit a couple of bitcents at a casino, make a bunch of tiny bets, and then withdraw the few milli you have left.  Only the deposit and withdrawal occur on the blockchain-- the bets and winnings are denominated in bitcoin, as in it claims "you just won a bitcoin," but nothing actually happens on the blockchain until you tell it to withdraw. 
The bitcoin tip bot does its transactions on the blockchain, which indeed has that disadvantage that you have to pay a transaction fee, and thus you can't give really micro donations, and you can't tip the next person quite as much as you got.  The ALTcointip bot does its transactions off the various blockchains it supports, so this doesn't cause anything to happen on the Namecoin chain: 
+alttip 1 nmc 
But *that* has the disadvantage that you have to trust the operator of that bot not to lose or abscond with the keys, or that they're not keeping only a partial reserve. 
I think it would be awesome to make new cool off-chain systems for making charitable microdonations!  We should gamify it, make a program where you're shooting satoshi at charities like Pew Pew Pew.  I'm a big fan of small numbers, everything has the right price if you can go low enough.  Like if I mention Habitat for Humanity right now that makes you want to give them some help, they're nice, but it doesn't make you want to break out your checkbook and get on their mailing list, but there's some sweet spot where it would be perfect if you could send them just the right number of satoshi.  Oh yeah, Habitat for Humanity, they're cool, I'll give them 164 satoshi, bam.  We'd just have to figure out how to code a functional spam and hacker resistant system that gives the experience we want. :)

Are you asking how to secure a Windows computer?  You cannot meaningfully secure a Windows computer. 
I think practically speaking the best route for Bitcoin security in the short-term might be to encourage people to do their transactions only after booting from a live CD.  PITA but it might be the best we can do.  We could at least get people to use that strategy for savings, occasionally booting it to break off some into their Windows hot wallet.

Right, no, that's right, we need politicians to do it because we need to make sure that unpopular things get done, and politicians are the best to do that, because if they don't do unpopular things like they're supposed to the people can vote them out, right, no, that makes sense, I'm agreeing with you.  Having the people decide what should be funded wouldn't work, because politicians can do that much better because they don't have to do what the people want, but also they're accountable because if people don't like what they do they can lose their elections.  So that all works out great and makes perfect sense, I agree.

That's very much what I've been imagining.  I'd expect it would only be a small minority of stable trusted cryptocurrencies that are considered worthy to be accepted everywhere and used to diversify payments and value stores, while around them is a giant wilderness of less trustworthy currencies that might be useful for this or that.  Humans won't mostly want to be bothered with even knowing what currency their bots actually transact things in!  Whatever works, please! :O
Like for example even at this early date I just discovered that I'm the owner of some Quora Credits.  It turns out those are a baseless inflationary currency that's worth nothing, but that's beside the point.  I had an agent, the Quora site, storing up Quora Credits for me that I got for upvotes for writing stuff on Quora sometime I guess.  It's not too much of a leap to imagine that I could have an agent that says "You want to buy something for weirdocoin?  Well, you have these Zowie World Credits that I can change for BTC pretty easily and from there we can get litecoin which for some weird reason is easy to exchange for weirdocoin..." and you're just like, yeah, click OK, oh I got Zowie World Credits somehow sometime weird I didn't even know that, but whatever!

I expect in the near future most people will get their first bitcoin as a gift or by buying a few dollars worth from their friends.

You have to also factor in competition, though.  There's already successful alt chains so the chances are slim of going all the way to those really high valuations without meaningful competition emerging.

That'd be cool, but how is putting a bunch of coins in circulation an "off" button?  All it's bad for is the short-term price.  To me it seems obvious that putting a bunch of BTC in circulation is good for Bitcoiners and good for Bitcoin.  That's a bunch of this useful resource for us to spread around and use.  It temporarily reduces the price of this useful resource, because there's more of it to go around.  That's good news if you need and use this stuff, a good time to buy, a good time to build.

The new 2-factor physical coins/bars are a pretty secure system, you don't even have to trust the issuer anymore not to keep the keys.  
Also I think a fun way to secure some bitcoin would be to do a bunch of the paranoid shit, but mostly for fun, and do it with a whole group of people like a whole local community of bitcoiners doing it together, and print out a zillion paper wallets for everyone.  That way you have a fun party, and distribute the cost of the Raspberry Pi you throw in the lake or whatever across all the participants. 
In the near future I'm sure we'll hear that the only way to have really *really* really secure hardware is to print it all yourself. :)

Bitcoins are like any currency: You get them by selling (or renting) anything you can get a good price for.  For instance you can offer something for sale somewhere like or offer a service somewhere like or -- but as you can see there's lots of competition, because everyone wants bitcoin now, so set your prices low I guess!? ;)
What a bitcoin's worth today is whatever someone will pay for it today.  Right now on MTGox they're selling for apparently $120ish.  But it's kinda hard to get onto MTGox, so you'll find slightly different prices other places.  Not so very different, of course, because if it were very different somewhere for very long someone would arbitrage with MTGox and make money until the difference went away. :) 
Tomorrow they could be selling for $1000ish or for $0ish, depending on a zillion *very* unpredictable factors.

It's not or it's and.  You're welcome to continue using just your phone.  That's surely the rational decision for *some* sufficiently small number of BTC, given the cost of buying or using the device vs the risks it reduces. 
Also in the near future a smartphone wallet will probably be more capable than a hardware wallet, doing magical things like changing currencies and rebalancing your portfolio.  A hardware wallet is more like a safe.  You don't have to carry your money around with you in a safe if you don't feel like you need the security.  But it is pretty cool that a safe full of money can fit in your pocket now hmm. 
Hey, maybe what you're really saying is that there's a market for a smartphone with a built in hardware Bitcoin wallet? :)

I'm not holding BTC as an investment.  I've been trying to spread what few coins I have around to people who'll use them wisely.  I consider the hoarding and early adopter rent to be an unfortunate side-effect which can hopefully be overcome or minimized as we all diversify into a variety of cryptocurrencies and cyberproperties.  IOW I think you're being greedy and you should share.  I absolutely do not want to benefit everyone in proportion to how much money they have; the very idea that it represents collective benefit to benefit people in proportion to their wealth sickens me; I want to benefit everyone equally as a human and friend.

Those could of course both be true (but they're not, bitcoins aren't magically deflationary).  But the narrative about how they're both simultaneously destroying Bitcoin still wouldn't make sense.  The narrative becomes "it's useless because it's volatile, which will make people not trust its value enough to want to buy and spend it, and also it's useless because people will see through the volatility to how it's slowly getting more valuable on average, which will make them hoard it."  Which is it?  Or is it that there are some people who are scared by volatility, some people who ignore the volatility and hold because of deflation, and yet no other groups of people anywhere who are willing to spend for any reason?  It doesn't make sense.  And again, incidentally, seriously: Bitcoin isn't magically deflationary.  It competes with other cryptocurrencies.

Anarchy isn't a particular magical state of reality that Anarchists are trying to cause to "happen" as an event.  We are not going to "cause Anarchy" and then step back and see what happens, as if "Anarchy" were some event separate from society.  Anarchists are people who are against hierarchy as a way of structuring society, so we think intelligently about how to reduce the involuntary control any and all people and institutions have over others.  If an action would lead to a state of chaos in which people would be able to take involuntary control over one another, Anarchists are universally against it.  Anarchists are thoughtful intelligent people with reasonable plans for the future.  Stop talking shit about us please.

The robber barons *were* a government, using both the official and [unofficial armies]( to control society.  It's *primarily* the accumulation of capital and the associated control of workers which is resisted by Anarchists.  The control of people by corrupt, centralized governments is believed by us to *follow* from this even more fundamental alienation, that is, from the workers' dispossession of the means of production.  Without that imbalance hierarchical government has no purpose; it needs to be a system of hierarchical oppression only in order to constantly suppress the working class.  The working class can easily agree to maintain a society which is free both from official governments and from unbidden governance by capital accumulations.  It can maintain this state by general agreement rather than by systematic violent oppression because it can be a generally beneficial agreement rather than class oppression.

Huh so they're just going to vaguely assume they can broadly deanonymize Bitcoin?  I feel like it's disingenuous of the Bitcoin Foundation &amp;c. to give them this impression.  These businesses just want so desperately to look acceptable and feed the government a pile of useless data to play with and just keep keeping any winds away from the house of cards.  That can last exactly as long as until they actually try to use that data to try to catch anyone and find out it's useless and then what's the plan?? :/ 
The plan only goes that far, which I can see how that's reasonable planning for the exchange operators because the end point the plan only goes as far as involves them having a giant pile of all kinds of money.  So then they can obediently shut down (thus cruelly confining Bitcoin to the *rest of the entire fucking universe* as its only source of sustenance), or do even more spectacular bullshit like support a crippled fork, or whatever.  None of which will matter. 
You know what's the worst part?  There's no plan at all for what to do about child pornographers.  This is the only plan they have so far, and it's a bad plan going worse, and they're not coming up with a better one.  You'd think that their (supposed?) *obsession* with child pornography to the exclusion of all other goods would at least result in a reduction of the abuse of children to produce pornography, particularly, but no, not even that! 
You know what would help children fight all forms of abuse?  GIVING ANY RIGHTS AT ALL TO CHILDREN.  THE GOVERNMENT IS THE JAILER OF ALMOST ALL OF THE ABUSED CHILDREN, WHO BY LAW MAY NOT LEAVE THEIR ABUSERS.  THIS IS SO FUCKING RIDICULOUSLY FUCKED UP.

This isn't the only alt coin tip bot in development so you have a lot of complaining left ahead of you. ;)  Cryptocoins *are* fake money that programmers can create at will-- OK not all of them, but Chinacoin for sure. ;) 
It doesn't make Bitcoin look strong if everyone's all worried any time any other coins have any tiny amount of value.  What secures the value of Bitcoin is the exaflop of computing, along with *many* other meaningful tangible resources (a dedicated foundation, full-time programmers, a committed community, a functional ecosystem, financing, hardware support).  Its value isn't just that no one has noticed yet that there's Terracoin too. :/  Trying to hide alt coins as if they're dangerous instead of simply explaining the difference is useless FUD; that actually makes it seem to the uninitiated like there isn't really a difference, or what would you be so insecure about?? :P
Anyway I think it's slightly out of date to say that **NOBODY** knows about or uses alt coins.  Litecoin in particular has seen some buzz and even a small amount of merchant adoption.  It'll probably be the first alt coin to break into the mainstream conversation.  And I think that's going to be great for Bitcoin as well; it'll be a really positive and clarifying discussion. 
This is just the very beginning of what will quickly become an incredibly complicated and diverse ecosystem, a whole new robotic economics.  I'll agree that we should try to keep from overwhelming people.  But people are going to be presented with the concept of alt coins soon enough-- they're actually what's happening.  We can simplify the presentation, but we can't simplify what's actually happening.

No, you don't.  You're not thinking about it at all.  People were complaining about the rates and terms of their student loans, rates which were corruptly fixed, terms which the banks used their corrupt influence to lock down (making student loans invulnerable to bankruptcy for instance) at the same time as they themselves were being bailed out.  They fixed the interest rates.  Students pay interest rates.  This connection is so direct as to not even be a connection but just an identity.  You are saying that people missed the point in protesting banks when they protested their loans, from those banks, the terms of which had just been altered against them, the rates of which were fixed.  I suppose it was also missing the point that homeowners were protesting their mortgage terms, what does that have to do with banking, right?  Fucking hell.

There's a few people already publicly earning their living entirely in BTC.  Presumably there's a lot more in the black market.  But I don't see how those people not earning other things makes that income especially legitimate or important. 
In the past there was just one currency in each place, so a currency had to do everything to do anything.  Bitcoin is both judged and promoted under that old set of assumptions, as either doomed because it's incapable of instantly being everything, or likely to singlehandedly conquer the world and be worth zillions.  But I think those assumptions are misplaced. 
These days there's lots of cryptocurrencies, as well as local currencies, and you have to somehow convert into the one you need at the moment.  It's a more complicated world than it used to be and I don't think it'll get simple again.

Yes, I think the synthesis isn't far away-- *rationally*.  It is very far away aesthetically.  Aesthetically the argument is not really about property so much as it's about the right to boss people around.  The property is a way to do the bossing.  So if the bossy people have to concede that one sort of property or another should be communal, that won't stop them from relentlessly seeking out some other property with which they can control people, even if it's an imaginary property, a religious property, whatever works for control.  There's no way to free people except to go trace up the strings, to see what part of the property existing originally on this Earth has been somehow concentrated or limited or otherwise sneakily manipulated to give someone control.  For instance when people claim they should have a million dollars of control because they have a bitcoin, you have to ask, well what do they really control in the world and how can we pry it from them.  Rationally that act of redistributing that wealth is just a voluntary association of most of everyone making a shrewd business decision and it ought to be perfectly compatible, but it doesn't fit in aesthetically, aesthetically it's just this feeling where people want to put people similar to themselves in control and call it a fair game.

Of course if no one's being defrauded or coerced then market exchanges are peaceful and fair.  But that's just circular reasoning. :P  Unfortunately, people being defrauded and coerced is the normal state of affairs in actual markets, bitcoin very much included.  The path of least resistance for capital is often or usually to fool someone somehow into making a bad trade and conceding a huge profit margin, rather than the hard work of digging up some real value in the world somewhere.  To change that we need much more accurate information, which means we need to cooperate on building reputable broad stable systems of trust and mutual aid.

Yeah the Bitcoin transaction fee is always vastly overstated, I think mostly in order to make it seem like it's in the same universe as the old systems-- "WU charges $10 but Bitcoin only charges 5 cents" is more comprehensible than "but Bitcoin charges essentially nothing as long as you bundle transactions."  Bitcoin seems more approachable as a magical but incremental improvement than as a deeply radical paradigm shift.
The actual fee structure is by kilobyte of data stored on the blockchain, which makes sense because that's the actual main cost of making a transaction.  It doesn't cost anyone more if you're moving larger amounts of coin; the coins are stored as an abstract number.  It costs more if there's more signatures from more addresses that need to be stored and verified to prove that all this happened.  So you pay the same amount to store the data that you moved a satoshi or that you moved a whole bitcoin, the same amount to distribute a single satoshi each to a thousand accounts or to distribute a whole bitcoin each to a thousand accounts.  It doesn't and shouldn't matter to the system that the former is a silly faucet and the latter is a significant financial activity.  It's based on the physics of the actual cryptographic system, not on some imaginary physics where money is heavy.

The only alternative to this is to have some sort of central mediator who knows and enforces what sorts of transactions are "supposed" to happen.  It's obvious and sickening if you think about it what an incredibly conformist society that tends to produce-- you not only must always be providing a good value from your own or your customers perspective, but also you must be providing value that would be obvious at a glance to some random stranger.  Better I'd say the risks and rewards of making our own personal judgments. 
It will become increasingly safe day-to-day to handle bitcoins, with hardware wallets &amp;c., but you should always also have the option to tear it down to the bare metal and make your own terrible mistakes. 


This quickly becomes a nightmare as they realize that what's shown on the open transparent ledger is just endless blank chains with the open and transparent and useless information that coins were sent between endless unidentified John Does.  They didn't catch the Silk Road through their coins. 


Well there's already plenty of paid developers.  It'll probably be the same normal open source model where lots of IT companies that need to integrate with Bitcoin have people working for them submitting changes to it.  But there's no reason it couldn't survive as a volunteer project, lots of open source projects survive that way as well.  No one paid Satoshi. 


I'm not convinced of the logical sense of this argument.  Couldn't this be applied to anything we do with computers?  No one thinks of having web browsing compute anything except the web page you asked for!?  It's not really a waste of energy at all, it's what we decided to do with some energy. 
Regardless, for whatever sense it makes this is part of the argument for the new prime finding coins like Primecoin and the upcoming Riecoin.  Instead of just hashes that happen to be low, Primecoin searches for prime chains that happen to be long.  That also has no day-to-day utility, but it *is* a branch of mathematics that's otherwise interesting to our society so it's at least *possible* that a database of such prime chains could be of *some* use maybe.  Maybe. 
There's nothing wrong though with just using our new supercomputer to secure things with really low hashes.  That's a fine algorithm, thanks Satoshi.  I don't think this is about the choice of algorithm!  I think what this thread of thought is really trying to say is that this is rather audacious, what *chutzpah* for a bunch of netizens to set up their own brand new extralegal channel for funding the world's largest computer.  Shouldn't giant computers require the approval of governments or corporations or *someone* in a suit? ;)  Can you really just make the largest supercomputer on Earth in your pajamas by making up the rules yourself?  But you can.  We did it.  We won.  Turns out it's a fine and actually extremely valuable and wise use of a large amount of computing, which is why people are voluntarily agreeing to collectively pay $25kish every 10 minutes to fund it.

This seems like a good strategy for Bitcoin particularly but a bad strategy for cryptocurrency generally and for the world.  The proposal is to trick people into using Bitcoin by not explaining to them that it's designed to destroy many things they are comfortable with.  That's a fine way to get people using it if that's your only goal but if you want broad participation in changing the system then you've still got to convince them at some point that the consequences of the thing they've started using aren't terrible.  You might even need to convince them not to try to *turn Bitcoin into* the safe friendly familiar thing you sold it to them as.  I think it's more radicalizing to present people with a whole story.  I think Bitcoin is most useful to society when people adopt it as part of a new identity, where it's seen as a tool to intentionally transform society by becoming an active agent.

I don't think even in seemingly obvious cases it'll prove possible to enforce particular movements of the coins.  We should just resign ourselves to the fact that anyone who has the key to an account can move the coins.  That's imperfect but that's how our system works, so far.  If we want more information in the system about human identity or justice or something we need to figure out how to get it in there in general, not just randomly trying to amend the rules after particular transfers that strike us as wrong.  The whole momentum of the system is designed to make that sort of afterthought rearrangement essentially impossible-- Bitcoin rolls on. 
Like now Casascius has been putting out two-factor bars so you don't have to trust him anymore.  That's a better way to go than planning to demolish the system if we were wrong to trust someone.  We have to build a system that works whatever way we want.  If we cut corners by trusting someone then we're intentionally taking on that risk.  Right now we built a system that we trust Casascius for however many tens of thousands of coins, and if we were wrong about that we're all going to have to eat that loss.  Instead of that risk we could pay the cost of having our second factors engraved ourselves, or whatever.  We're in charge now and we get to decide for ourselves how things work.

Stability doesn't actually make sense though, does it?  It's either worth many thousands or nothing, really.

OK well the Litecoin tip bot isn't quite working yet, but just imagine for the purpose of this example that there was a working bot for tipping Litecoin as well as Bitcoin.  We could trade one for the other right here in this sequence of comments, no problem.  Let's say we agree on ฿0.03 for each Litecoin, which appears to be the going rate for some reason these days.  I have some Litecoin and I want some Bitcoin, so I tip you a Litecoin, and then you tip me back three bitcents, and then I tip another Litecoin and you tip another ฿0.03, etc., or however we want to split it up.  Or we tell some bots to do it for us, whatever.  It's super easy. 
The problem with exchanging US dollars or any other fiat currency here is that we haven't figured out (yet) how to get any fiat based or fiat pegged instruments in here.  It's no accident and it's not incompetence.  The governments have been *intentionally* and proudly preventing us from making any way to sell fiat here, both because they're deeply corrupted by selling people access to the money system and because they just like controlling things.

Seriously how does it work if BTC are transferred all the time to well known addresses?  I guess as soon as a transaction is seen to any of them there's a flood of transactions from everyone claiming it.  Is it random who takes it?  Or it's an auction for who puts the largest transaction fee?  If that's the case it would send almost all of the coins sent to well known addresses to the miners, I guess?  Hm.

Yeah I agree, that would be good to have in the main client even though it's a specialized feature because the cover of having the code widely distributed is important to that sort of security.  Long term though I don't know what sense it makes to depend on any security system that involves keeping human thoughts secret, since brains aren't even very insulated and seem to leak their thoughts to anyone in the general area with a decent radio.  We should focus on securing coins in systems that no human has any sort of direct access to.

Right wing "libertarians" aren't too big on the thinking things through to their inevitable conclusions thing. ;)  Actual anarchists do have some ideas about how to create an actual justice system.  Consider for instance that juries are a relatively horizontal system; jury systems have their weaknesses, but they don't require a separate class of jurists from the rest of society.  It's true that it's quite difficult creating a system that's actually just and equitable, but that doesn't mean that the status quo has anything at all going for it.  The status quo justice system is just to appoint one person to make all the decisions, which is a terrible system on the face of it and fails utterly in practice every time it's been tried; it's perfectly corruptible and deeply unpleasant.

But have you actually tried using Litecoin??  It's all well and good to say in theory that a Litecoin transaction isn't especially secure after one confirmation, and I agree with that, and I do know rationally that Litecoin is more likely to have forks etc., but that doesn't mean that it doesn't feel satisfying when a transaction goes "ping" so quickly.  It feels like butter. 
Using smaller coins rather than smaller BTC denominations is also entirely psychological-- but still real!  For instance I was thinking about why Cryptsy uses LTC trading pairs often instead of BTC, and I realized maybe it's just because the values of worthless things are getting distorted by running into the satoshi barrier.  Again, I don't rationally think this makes any real sense at all, and if I were running an exchange I would go sub-satoshi from the get-go.  But not everyone's thinking rationally all the time.  Litecoins feel smaller and lighter. 
There are rational reasons to value a diversity of networks, also.  When Bitcoin forked earlier this year, Litecoin processed transactions smoothly the whole time-- chew on that.  But those rational concerns don't hold much weight either.  The value of cryptocoins is so so far from being a rational technocratic matter these days.

Well by far the most likely course of events I'd say is that they keep their official currency officially in place while slowly quietly transitioning more of their actual day-to-day economy into cryptocurrency, just like the rest of us.  But it would be an awesome step if they simply openly declared themselves to be switching.

It occurs to me that selling BTC for cash actually conflates two problems.  It might be simpler to just sell exchange credit for cash.  Then you can use the exchange credit to buy whenever (and whatever, if it's a multicurrency exchange) you want.  Perhaps that would lessen this element of "you sold me this thing that went up/down in value" and it would certainly remove the complication of having to determine a different price for each transaction.

The Bitcoin transaction record has a detailed record of everything that happens.  We have one way of interpreting it now, which is that all these coins that are completely fungible, that are the "same thing," are moving around, and it doesn't matter which is which.  But even though that's always been the idea, we do *have* the information of which coin is going where, so we don't *have* to think about it that way.  We could indeed, as people are always pointing out, taint coins that were involved in terrible crimes-- that's one sort of coin coloring, an involuntary sort.  We could also choose a transaction voluntarily to be the origin of a batch of colored coins, and then do whatever we want with those coins.  If we just agree on a protocol, anyone with a client with the same protocol can look at the same blockchain everyone has and decide how many each account has of what color of coin.  We are currently actively discussing and debating such protocols.

Yeah.  The distributed costs everyone pays for the insecurity of *cash* itself is also enormous, if you stop taking it for granted.  I mean imagine if there were a paper money forum somewhere on the internets where people posted to complain every time some paper money got stolen-- you couldn't read any of it because it would be a blur, it would be a constant stream.  Even if it were just from your very local area, it would still be a huge stream.  Someone had cash money stolen from them a few months ago a block from here, and it wasn't even news, though fruitlessly investigating it did cost us some of the $10,000,000 our little city pays every single year for police.  It's expensive and dangerous not just to use cash but to live anywhere near anyone else who does. 
Just a few weeks ago, one of my favorite local convenience stores had all their cash robbed-- and then *again* the next week.  I go to that store all the time and the painful prices I pay reflect that weakness.  Not just that particular lost cash, but more insidiously the whole arrangement of security and defense and guardedness that's necessary every day of the year to keep it from happening even more often. 
But we're used to that.  We grew up with that.  I was staring at a random spot on the wall the other day, trying to comprehend something about bitcoin (I think I was thinking about m-of-n transactions, what social structures they could harmonize with) and I suddenly flashed back to being in grade school and being taught to do math with nickels and dimes.  I suddenly realized that I had actually totally accepted on a *very* deep level the implication that this stuff was real and solid and just how the world *is* and not just some random idea that could blow away any moment.  The qualities of bitcoin aren't carved so deeply into me like that, I have to turn them over in my mind and try to teach them to myself, I've had to become a child again in this new world.

I wonder about this.  Is it possible it could eventually be cheaper to buy a transaction by paying a negotiated fee off the blockchain to a mining consortium or something than to make an official transaction fee bid??  The official auction in the protocol is quite efficient, so it's not easy to think of what might beat it, but I have an intuition there *might* be something.
EDIT: Like maybe a cooperative mutualist mining structure that ensures free transactions to its member-owners!?  I don't know the technical details well enough, would this work: Include the transaction with no fee in blocks the collective is trying to mine, without publishing it, but then if the collective doesn't find a block fast enough, just publish it with a fee so someone else takes it.
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:28:51
Bitcoin keys and transactions can be both very very valuable and very very small, and can be transmitted cheaply over any medium, which limits the effectiveness of control strategies that involve or require limiting the movement of value.

Yeah, you just pay with your phone and no, there's no reason to worry about having the network confirm and reconfirm the transaction if you're selling something in person to someone you can see in front of you.  You just accept the transaction as soon as it's visible on the network, which usually takes seconds.  What kind of crazy motherfucking hacker would rig up a whole Bitcoin double-spend operation to get free vegetables at a farmers' market?! :O  What do they grab their veggies and quickly run away before the double-spend goes through?! ;)  It's a *way* way smaller risk than taking dollar bills without checking carefully whether they're counterfeit.

What's hard is to make a paper wallet with *zero* chance at all that someone else has the private key.  It becomes difficult because of the absoluteness of that requirement.  It's not difficult to get or use a paper wallet if you have people you know and trust.  You can just ask someone who knows how to print one securely to do it for you and trust them that they're not keeping a copy of the private key.  Or maybe you could even trust them to keep a copy of the private key for you, in case you lose the paper wallet!  If you don't know any people you trust to not steal your money then not being able to make paper wallets is the least of your problems. ;)

Right, it's *not* the easiest way to move money between countries *quite yet*.  Besides the fees if you're doing the currency conversion on each end there's also the inconvenience that there's few methods or locations to convert it and there's the danger of BTC's volatility, etc.  Think about what we're saying though!!!  If it were *already cheaper* than the systems people are presently using then it would *instantly* take over that gigantic market *today*!!!  Saying that it's *just slightly* more expensive than that huge market *while the costs are rapidly plunging* doesn't mean that it's something you shouldn't even bother thinking about-- I mean unless that is you are personally transferring money *today*.  If you are transferring money today, I recommend Western Union, tried and tested.  If you are talking about as long from now as *later this year* then it is possible that Bitcoin will be slightly cheaper instead of slightly more expensive **which will be one of the most dramatic economic changes ever in history**.

Here's a wacky idea of how to deal with the confirmations issue: You send money to the store (or, better, an escrow) when you *enter*, pick out what you want (which hopefully takes at least a confirmation or two), then the store sends you your change as you leave.  But that would require changing habits/culture so more realistically: Use Litecoin instead for offline retail sales; 2.5 minutes is a lot better.  Or most realistic of all and what I expect will happen first: Just accept payment with no confirmations.  Nobody's going to try to pull a double spend on security camera.

Huh, I know offline!  Small world.  Anyway thinking more about it, it would actually have been very difficult to convince our Occupy to systematically turn their cash USD donations into BTC as a way of storing them.  Rationally it might have made sense but you couldn't explain it to people.  It'll probably still be difficult to integrate into our organizing going forward.  I think one way to make it work could be to make it seem like an extra add-on, to say "hey, let's have a bitcoin address so people have that option for how to anonymously donate," and people would agree but they'd assume that it would be a minor side thing and they could just cash out those funds into "real" money if they need them-- but then those causes that catch the internets' attention will start to get rushes of zillions of bitcoins, and then it'll start to seem real. :)

Do you have any ideas for any forms of regulation that would work at limiting the spread of Bitcoin?  The whole point of the system is to allow financial transactions to escape detection/regulation.  My impression of the situation is that the states have been recognizing that they can't control it as it is, so they're deciding to try to gradually transform it into something they like.  But that's not going to work either, unless you know something I don't?  It's not just a matter of controlling the name Bitcoin or controlling a few famous people.  There's a lot of cryptos already and the explosion's hardly even begun.  Cryptocurrency is a simple idea that's easy to implement and impossible to stop.

Mt Gox is presently surviving and has low fees/risks.  It's not like what people are doing is the *only* option-- it's the *cheapest* option.  No one can justify paying even a few more percent or just a little more risk on thousands of dollars, so they bend just a little to the system-- only just exactly as long as it's cheapest.  This gives the governments only very shallow power.  If they restrict or encumber the exchanges in *any* way, they will immediately lose to the other channels.  They're only ahead by at best a few percent and a small measure of convenience.

Well BTC almost hit $100 again today so I'll use that since it makes the math easy. ;)  I saw somewhere there's 43,000,000 reddit users.  Whatever that means.  So one satoshi for each of them is ฿0.43 or $43, ten satoshi each is ฿4.3 or $430, a hundred satoshi each would be ฿43 or $4,300, but alas this does not include the prohibitive fees.  I think the bitcoin tip bot just reduced its fees from 50,000 satoshi to 20,000 satoshi, but still, that's ฿8,600 or $860,000 in fees to tip everyone any amount.  To tip each redditor ฿0.001 or 100,000 satoshi which is just about the lowest amount that's really reasonable with the fees would total I guess ฿43,000 + ฿8,600 = ฿51,600 = $5,160,000.  So since there hasn't been millions of dollars in tipping, that would explain why most redditors are still complaining of not yet having received their first tips.  Huh.

They absolutely do accept bitcoin.  You are tripping yourself out.  You give them bitcoin and then they give you something, so that is them accepting bitcoin.  What is confusing you is that they then IMMEDIATELY sell the bitcoin.  Like before they are done handing you the item, they have already sold the bitcoin.  But they did in fact accept it, they just resold it very very quickly to someone who'd like to accept the exchange rate volatility (they're not hard to find).  Why should anyone speculate if they don't want to, when thousands of speculators are standing by, steady cash in hand ready to take the risk?  It's like instant free insurance.  You are just not used to money moving that *fast* because it mostly didn't, before (or only did for the largest corporations, rather).

What resources does WU have that have anything to do with transferring money?  I assert that their niche is regulatory compliance, it's selling information to the government. 
It's only for a half of a moment that there's the unstable situation that you have to try to work hard to find one person in Mexico to accept Bitcoin.  Even when there's just a few people in whatever city who'll change it, people will start to switch to that because it's more anonymous and personal, even *before* it's cheaper.  It's true that they'll have no local shops they could spend it at-- during that *very first* wave of transfers.  But they'll transfer anyway just to change the money.  And then they'll have coin.  By the secord or third wave of transfers, like it could literally be only a few months later, someone has given into the huge incentive to be the first business to accept it.  Then instead of this story where it's absurd that anyone in Mexico would take anything except pesos you have dominos falling. 
Heck what am I talking about, I *know* of a business in Mexico that takes cryptocurrency.  [Tabita](  I think they take *Litecoin* of all things.  They take Litecoin because they got a capital infusion to buy an oven from some unregulated Litecoin stock exchange.  Or maybe that doesn't exist at all!  Who knows what's going on!  Unregulated stock exchanges!?  I am astounded!! 
Anyway, bottom line, this idea WU reportedly has that it's obviously going to be a long time before people in Mexico accept cryptocurrency: Completely. Fucking. Absurd.  The only scenario that could even slightly slow adoption there would be a legal crackdown, and we're talking about a nearly failed narco state.  It's over.

Don't buy things you don't understand?  I'm not sure myself whether or not BTC is a good buy now at $1,200 or whatever, and you know far less, so if you happened to get money that way it would just be on a gamble.  Anyway yeah the reason it broke at that price was because of the crowd psychology of that uninformed gamble.  It went up so fast that people sold because they were just thinking of the prices they bought in at because they had no way to actually estimate the value.  If you buy something for $100 and then it's selling for $250 and you have no idea why it was ever either of those prices, you sell. 
The US government cannot "lock bitcoin funds" or do anything to stop Bitcoin.  That is established and they have accepted it and that's why the price is surging now.  Basically what the US government is going to try to do to Bitcoin now is kill it with kindness.  Pop popcorn.

If you can invent a system that will randomly reward *humans*, with an equal chance per person, then I'd happily join you and support it.  I don't know any such system.  We could make a centralized registry of all of the humans (and continually verify their existence to fight fraud), but that is very expensive and controlling and generally undesirable in every way. 
Bitcoin is just a tiny part of the emerging virtual economic system.  It rewards people who do the work that it needs in order to keep itself alive because nobody is securing a currency network for free.  On the whole I believe it is a technology of liberation, not because of its benefits to miners or traders but because of the many ways which it frees people from government and corporate control.

I agree that Bitcoin is *more* useful than Litecoin, but that's not quite the same as Litecoin being useless or valueless.  Bitcoin didn't have any of those things either until recently and it turns out it was a good buy.  I don't think there's any reason Litecoin in *particular* should do especially well in the future, but I also don't see any reason why it shouldn't.  This scenario where Bitcoin alone has *any* value or utility seems almost impossible to me.  Especially as more of our transactions become partially or fully automated I would expect them to spread into multiple currencies; it feels to me like that's how to keep things balanced and flowing smoothly.

And then at some point the entire process can be automated: An autonomous process (not controlled by any human) rents some office space, buys printers, prints out computers with solar panels on them, and then distributes them to the most profitable weak (yet sunny) points in the network to earn coin to sustain the operation.

If it's "voluntary" you should pick your price!?  If you can pick your price and the minimum is zero or the cost of transmission and storage and you can buy things anonymously for free then your system can work because it won't be so easily outcompeted!!  It just has to provide incentives to raise your price above zero, for instance just publishing publicly who paid how much tends to incentivize some conspicuous consumption.  Just please don't raise the sale price by *threatening to shoot people who buy from other vendors*; you can raise the price of *anything* that way and it has nothing to do with the value of the thing "sold" that's just how you're laundering the extortion. :/ 
You must assume that there will be a copy of the same data available for free.  You must design systems that compete with free.  If it is possible to advertise on the thing being sold, you must compete with systems that *pay users*.  That's what happens. 
I don't think we need to incentivize ideas at all.  I find that an oddly anachronistic notion.  We are in the midst of a Singularity.  If there were a way to put the brakes on people coming up with new ideas that would be great actually.  Since there isn't, we get to deal with this rate of change as best we can.  But intentionally making *new* incentives for things to go *faster*?!  The notion astounds me.  How impatient are you?? :O

Huh, you're right, we'll have to take this absoluteness very seriously as we invent more forms of cryptographic property.

They told me I get zero fees and zero percent and zero dollars down and zero worries!"  They work at a desk as a cog for some corporation and they just vaguely assume that they *could* start their own company if they wanted, but why not just comply, right?  It's such a nice desk.  And zero fees.  And we're at peace with the world.

Yes, they absolutely must be.  Property "rights" that are not voluntary agreements are (by logical necessity) simply using force to control property.

I've gotten a vibe that some really anti-Western communists might be instinctively liking Bitcoin even though they don't quite understand it just because they can tell that it's bad for the West.  Anything's good that could possibly destabilize the Western dominance of financial systems, right??

Well if you're selling something for bitcoins the safe thing is to convert the amount you want to go towards your hard costs right away into whatever you pay your hard costs in.  But a lot of the sales that could be made in Bitcoin are selling excess capacity where the hard costs have already been paid.  For instance consider this new market opening up of people renting their guest rooms now for BTC; sure there's substantial dollar costs to maintaining that room but they're already paying them.  Or the people moonlighting on can sell an hour of work online that they couldn't sell to their regular employer. 
You don't have to start a whole elaborate business to sell something for bitcoin-- it doesn't have any setup or maintenance costs, it's as cheap and easy as someone handing you a quarter.  You can just use it to monetize whatever random little things for fun.  It would be a lot better for Bitcoin's psychological health if newcomers would think of fun little ways to earn a bit of coin rather than trying to push more fiat through our strained bulging money tubes. :)

Just because repayment of a fixed amount of bitcoin is weird terms for a loan doesn't mean that you can't loan someone money on reasonable terms using bitcoin.  For instance I could loan you 100 USD worth of bitcoin today with the agreement that you'll pay me back $100 + interest worth of bitcoin at the end of the loan term-- or euros or gold or whatever seems reasonable to you to price the loan in.  The medium of transaction is completely orthogonal to the agreement of how repayment will be calculated.

Um why do you believe that it's not possible to organize large groups without hierarchies?  What do hierarchies have to do with organizing large groups?  Hierarchies in my experience cause *disorder*, by reducing the amount of intelligence that goes into making group decisions.  Do you have a different experience?  Do you have an argument?  Again there *have been* large scale Anarchist organizations, for instance in revolutionary Catalonia.  They *did coordinate* large scale actions between communities (using a combination of both market and non-market exchanges).  That happened.  Your argument is that this isn't possible "pretty much by definiton"?  Are you arguing then that those wide scale organized activities did *not* happen in Anarchist territories, or, um, what?

You don't need the private key to check the balance of an account, the balance is public.  So now that you've told us that address, we can all see from now on exactly when and how much bitcoin is transferred to and from it.  You'll need to make a new wallet and not tell anyone the public key if you want it to be private at all how you use it. :)

Yeah that's what I've been thinking, most transactions will be between automated agents, with many or even most of them fully autonomous.  One consequence I've imagined is that when you buy any piece of hardware you'll be looking at two numbers-- the upfront cost, but also the expected rate of return.  It'll be considered a deficiency of a household object if it doesn't eventually earn its production cost.

No one's saying you have to give up half of your land that you're currently actively intensively farming to feed your family.  That's *no one's* position.  OK fine I take it back, you can never say that, there's surely *someone* who thinks that you should have to share your little farm.  But it is not me or any of my anarchist friends and that is not what the main ideological dispute is about between these tendencies. 
The people who must give up their farms are for instance the white landowners who claim to "own" so much of Africa.  People who have not been anywhere near their farms in years, with no dirt under their fingernails-- what we say is that their farms must be considered to be owned by the people who *work there every day* and produce *all* of the value of the farm.  Not that they should be seized or controlled by any outside entity, not that they should be changed in any way, but simply that they should continue to work as they have been but with the *benefits* going to those actually *involved* instead of continuing to be stolen.  That is common sense. 
Allowing there to be "owners" who have nothing to do with a property except for holding a historic title-- and doing nothing even to disrupt the continuity of titles earned directly from feudalism and criminality and confiscation and slavery-- is dangerous nonsense.  It would be a more effective, less morally poisoned system to simply choose people completely at *random* to benefit from particular pieces of property. 
The Anarchist position is not that people may randomly move into places and seize them.  Indeed that is the status quo position, that having randomly wandered onto African and native lands the white people now "own" them.  The Anarchist position is that actual investigation and common sense and history must be considered, actual respect must be given to actual peoples, and we must cooperatively decide how to share the Earth in peace.

Bitcoin is a lot of things.  Other than a payment system and a store of value and a ledger of accounts and all that, it's also a unit of account-- things are denominated in bitcoins, things are understood to have an agreed value in bitcoins, debts are agreed to be paid in bitcoins.  So there are many other assets which have a stable value against the bitcoin.  For instance, if you open an account at BitVegas you make just one blockchain transfer to deposit some bitcoin, and another later to withdraw your winnings or, more likely, what little is left of your money.  Nothing happens on the blockchain when you place a bet on a pig in their pig racing game.  Exciting pig related events happen where bitcoin denominated assets (namely, BitVegas credits) are won and lost, but on the blockchain nothing happens.  There are a bunch of people apparently who play on this server all day long-- the blockchain sees nothing, just very occasional deposits and withdrawals.  The chain is a place where accounts are settled and very permanently recorded by a neutral third party for a fee, not the main place where events happen that transfer bitcoin-denominated assets.

OK now that you grok that, grok this with me, my water sibling: I get that and you get that, but it will be *years* before *everyone* gets that.  We could *try* to just educate people verbally about what the value of a satoshi is, but frankly it's difficult to put into words anyway; the *experience* is going to be how most people come to deeply understand it.  They *are* going to do a bunch of real hard labor for tiny amounts of satoshi.  We can just be amused by the oddity of that, or we could perhaps recognize that it is **one of the most significant economic opportunities in history**.  An endless stream of people who will produce actual value in exchange for µBTC-- what wonders this strange world does produce.

Coin coloring is still under development.  It allows you to make a bunch of currencies on a single blockchain.  To massively oversimplify, you just consider one transaction to be the genesis transaction for a particular color of coin, and any coins that descend from that transaction are that color.  All of the new colors of Bitcoin would be as secure as Bitcoin itself-- they're exactly the same thing as Bitcoin, there's no changes to the underlying protocol, it's just a different idea about how to interpret or give meaning to the signals already in the system!  Alternate coins like Litecoin are different, Litecoin has its whole own chain secured by a different algorithm than Bitcoin's.

Short answer, no.  Mining is still the only way to easily resell your computer's resources.  I think reselling disk space for encrypted storage would also make sense.  But there are all sorts of complications to actually implementing such things.  The main business model I know of for people who want to buy quick torrenting is to rent a seedbox.  So *someone* is making some BTC reselling their computers' ability to torrent (whoever's renting out those seedboxes), but it's not yet an open source distributed process.

State support is terrible for Bitcoin's fundamentals.  Resisting state censorship is Bitcoin's raison d'être.  Fortunately there's still plenty of states with plenty of motives to resist open money.

But um we all know what happened to Jim Bell so I guess what I meant to say is that we can stand back and I'm sure the governments will come up with a centralized way to prevent that so no worries. :|

I've been thinking about how we can reconceptualize Bitcoin as something beyond money.  Money is just a loose analogy for what it's like, it's a new thing.  What if we encountered this technology for the first time and didn't know what it was supposed to be used for?  What if this was just an alien technology with no explanation and we didn't know what it did?  What does Bitcoin actually do? 
Bitcoin creates digital scarcity.  Scarcity is so ordinary in the analog world where things are constantly falling apart that we hardly even realized at first on the web that we had a terrible scarcity of scarcity.  It's great when things are freely reproducible but you actually come upon a problem when *everything* is freely reproducible.  For instance a person comes up to you and says "Hi!  I'm a person!  I'm happy to prove that by giving you a copy of anything you like!"  OK well that could be a real person or it could be any computer pretending to be a trillion imaginary people and there's absolutely no way to tell them apart because anyone can make a trillion copies of anything. 
You can't take any incoming data as meaning anything at all!!!  **Without Bitcoin you can't take any incoming data on the web as meaning anything at all**!!!  Every message just means "some agent on the web had access to the following data"-- AND EVERY AGENT HAS ACCESS TO ALL THE DATA.  Without scarcity it's the same message, it's just trillions and quadrillions of copies of the same empty message. :O
