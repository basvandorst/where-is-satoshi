Same problem. The difference is they never answered my first attempt to get verified.

Are you kidding? Every major monarch wants gold, tons and tons of jewelry  were produced with gold. What about bitcoin? It has been available since 2010, it sucks as a way to store money and sucks as a way to count because its price is always going up and down. You don't know how much food you can buy if you agree to receive your paycheck in bitcoins, in this moment bitcoin only fill one of the three requirements in order for it to be considered a good currency. Yes, some people may want to own bitcoin for whatever reason, but it's far from being gold. 
You may be right though perhaps everyone decided to own bitcoin despite being pretty much useless/worse than any regular currency for whatever use people decide to give it and not as an investment. Only future will tell.

You can, but it's worse than cash. You either get bitcoin by mining it or by buying it from someone who did. Since very few people use bitcoin, it's harder to get bitcoin than regular cash. Actually, it's very likely that people are buying bitcoin with regular cash... why would you use something worse to achieve the same goal?
As for the price, I'm saying it's overpriced because bitcoin hit it's highest value in 2013. It only returned to that value in the end of 2016, with no reason for it other than popularity. The only major event this year capable of impacting bitcoin price was the petya ransomware, other than that it has just followed the natural course of people getting to know it and using to move cash offshore or whatever.

Bitcoin is currently in a bubble. It has four main uses:
1. **Anonymous payments:** people use bitcoin to intermediate anonymous payments to stuff like VPNs, pr0n, etc. The thing is, there aren't enough people doing this to justify the current prices. Also, nobody who does this sits on bitcoins for long, they make the payment and move on and bitcoin suffers heavy competition from pre paid credit cards, since they do the same thing and are easier to use. Finally, it shouldn't affect the currency price heavily because as soon as people buy bitcoins, they spend it, and as soon as people receive it, they trade it for US$ or whatever, keeping supply and demand always balanced.
2. **Cyber Crime:** piracy, cp, ransomware, drugs... Bitcoin is used to make payments on the criminal underworld and here it only faces competition from other cryptocurrencies. It's bitcoin area of excellence. If you are hit with a ransomware, you will be obliged to pay with bitcoin, since the hackers don't want your US$ that they can't launder, it increases the demand. Also, those guys have to sit on bitcoin. They can't just use it to intermediate the transaction in a couple of seconds, they have to sit on it. And it may be also convenient to sit on bitcoins, since those guys are always needing it.
3. **Tax evasion:** also, another major  use for bitcoin, sometimes legal, sometimes illegal and sometimes in a grey area. But again, this doesn't impact the bitcoin price to heavily because whoever does this, just buy and sell bitcoin as soon as possible. It keeps supply and demand balanced.
4. **Especulation:** people buy bitcoin and sit on it hoping that it's value will increase. This also increases the demand and bitcoin price. The problem is that, once those guys figure out there won't be a profit, they will cause supply to go way up, decreasing bitcoin value.
If you look at it, you will see that the current increase on cybercrime can't justify the increase on bitcoin demand.  Uses for privacy and for "tax evasion" don't justify the prices since the trades are instantaneous. The only thing left is speculation, and when speculation is the only thing driving prices up we have a bubble.
I believe in bitcoin, but we are not in the place where it should cost US$4k. It's use must become more widespread before it can have a significant demand from people who will actually buy it and hold it for a good reason.

Created an account and tried to buy bitcoins but wasn't able because they never checked the confirmation pictures. Tried to open a support ticket and never got an answer.
I'm now worried about what they are going to do with my data.
