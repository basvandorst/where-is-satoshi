Note that that bitcoind has the same problem.

I don't think is means that. He wants "instant" transfers, implying not sending from one address to another, which would take time broadcasting and confirming. He simply wants to transfer the private keys from one wallet to another.

That seems like a lot of hassle, and doesn't sound "instant" at all.
First of all, addresses don't exactly have "balances". Addresses just allow you to spend coins.
And what exactly do you mean by "and he then transfers all the bitcoin back into his main account"? You mean adding the keys to his wallet? Sure he can do that, but how will he know that you won't just transfer those coins to another address? You do, after all, still have a copy of the private keys.
Really, transferring coins the proper way is the only way to do it.
Edit: Looks like he meant something else. An interesting idea! See here:

It would be interesting to make a wallet that separates all your coins into different denominations to different addresses. Then you could "print" your own cash: $1 addresses, $10 addresses, etc. When paying for a good, just take out the "cash" required and the merchant quickly scans the QR code on each bill, sending the coins to the merchant's wallet.
That would be a cool solution for those without smart phones and the technologically impaired.
