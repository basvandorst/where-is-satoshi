80-90%, but altcoins havent been around for 9 years. I can see btc dominance going back down to 50%. or all altcoins could fail, who knows. Im not saying invest in altcoins, but if your in it already, chances are your at a loss and should just hodl
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:23:25
unpopular answer: No. Bitcoin dominance is at a high. If you sold now, you would be effectively buying high and selling low. I suggest to hodl
Unless you invested extremely early and your up in price (btc), then selling is the safer option

I understand what your saying, but how is the debt going to be serviced when its already 105% of GDP. Government borrowing is going to become much more expensive in the future (Japan, China decreased their US treasury holdings, and the FED tried QT for a minute), and that 105% is projected to grow rapidly. 
On top of that, your making an assumption that GDP will be going up or at least stay constant, what if (or perhaps when) we have another recession like 2008. If i remember correctly Obama borrowed a lot of money to prevent the banks from collapsing (collapsing banks would lower GDP). Borrowing another huge amount of money, or a lowering of the GDP would be really bad for the national debt.
Everyday I dont see the US fixing its balance sheets and creating a surplus the more likely I see the devaluing of the currency to get us out of the national debt. 
Someone pls tell me im wrong, everything is A-OK, and i can go back to my nap

I just looked this up today
xbt is basicly just another code for btc, but its based on currency codes. I think gold is xau, and platinum is xpt, xbt wasnt taken so they gave it to bitcoin. Basiclly just a stock code for bitcoin. I think, I could be entirely wrong

I thought it was good to educate, but it came back to bite me in the ass. The friends I told mocked me, told me I was stupid and wasting my money, and I should put my money into a house, cause housing has gone up for the last 50 years and will always continue to go up. If I had of listen to them I would already be slightly negative, instead ive already made huge gains (for a conventional market)
I dont talk to those friends anymore because of other toxic behavior....so just be careful who you tell

Not exactly true. Off the top of my head having a majorly liberal institutions performing a study on IQ and political affiliations is going to produce skewed result. Also, it really depends on how you define conservatism. I quickly googled it, and the study i found separated conservatives from liberals based on questionnaire, but the questions were poorly chosen. Turns out being liberal about gay issues, and legal abortion is actually associated with a high IQ, but liberal ideology regarding progressive taxes, banning guns/offensive speech was not associated with IQ.

About borrowing. If bitcoin is used as a currency, and say we have mined all 21 million bitcoin, wouldn't borrowing with interest be impossible? Where would the bitcoin come from to pay the interest? I think debt may be impossible under bitcoin, or at least cause some people to never be able pay off debts

2008 was a huge eye opener for me too. I was fairly young and caused me to be interested economics, which eventually led to realize how important bitcoin is. Funny enough, its said bitcoin was created in response to 2008

Hold your own private key. No need to regulate to level of a bank. It's not hard. Just got to make it common knowledge. There are already companies with wallets that dont track your private key. I'm not sure but I believe Samsung 10's keep key app, might be one of them
If you paranoid create a wallet while disconnected from the internet
@_date: 2019-04-01 03:43:20
Except it's never been hacked, and personally I find sending interact e transfers harder than sending bitcoin. I will give you a lot of alts are corrupt, but this is a bitcoin subreddit.

Help unbanked people in developed nations? Do they even exist? Getting a bank account in a developed nation is not a problem, even if you are poor. Its not like the unbanked in 3rd world, where banks do not operate anywhere in their area (real problem)
@_date: 2019-04-01 03:59:42
I actually do find interact transfers harder. You have to get their email, share a password with them. Bitcoin you just need they're public key, and most wallets figure out the fees for you. I send a lot more btc transfer than etransfers though
Are some wallets easily cracked? If you, and you alone, hold your private key it should be pretty crack proof
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:05:17
I was kind of hoping it would be an actual puppy
@_date: 2019-04-01 04:59:26
If you've created a wallet, sent transactions, you'd understand how easy it is. I'm an idiot, who can barely deal with a bank transfer, and I manage it no problem. No need to regulate. ICOs and alts are a different matter
Also I dont think regular banking is going to disappear anytime soon (unpopular opinion)
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:26:22
Unpopular because its wrong. The number of serious adopters who appreciate the technology has greatly increased. I think its safe to say people holding btc at the bottom of the market are serious adopters who love it for the technology. Look at the previous low, ~$240, look at the new low, ~$3200. That is a major increase of hodlers
Ive been holding bitcoin for awhile, spectating for even longer. There is always guys expressing this exact same sentiment at the bottom of the market. Like clockwork

No, they are being punished by inflation. Just because the Venezuela's government printed off money to pay for its debts doesn't mean the Venezuelan citizen should be punished with hyperinflation. Furthermore, the bank can hold your funds from you, say if there is a run on the bank. With bitcoin only you have access to your money, and it's out of the government's control 
Your wrong, populations are exploited through their currency, and bitcoin is completely different than U.S. dollars. Please do more research before spreading FUD
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:52:40
Your right, the answer is always to look after yourself. I do that by owning bitcoin and persevering my financial freedom.

"I'm curious as to why you see speculative value in a belief" Is it just a belief? Bitcoin is decentralized, immutable form of transaction. This allows the user to have financial freedom away from the banks. This is the real value of bitcoin. If you dont understand ask a Venezuelan

411 days is where it bottomed out. It took 3 years in total to regain its peak (~$1000), then after that we had that massive bull run we all remember, and hope for again. You got a lot more than 2 months to stack. I think more time to stack is a good thing though :)
