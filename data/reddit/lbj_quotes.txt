I don't think you did.  My fault, I'm not explaining well.  
People seem to be doing "analysis" based on the length of candle wicks.  The length of wicks is completely arbitrary, since I can lengthen or shorten them by changing the time at which a day starts.  This decision is totally arbitrary since bitcoin is traded 24 hours/day.  
Therefore, any analysis based on wick length is bullshit.

are we STILL doing this?  what year are we in?

Then people are going to be confused.  You can't just start speaking Swahili and expect people to follow along.  u/djulac is right.

That's one way to see it, yes.  The concept of an "opening" or "closing" price doesn't make sense in this market.  You can have a high/low within a given 24-hour period, but that 24-hour window can be moved around.
  
So, any TA based on wick length is bullshit (TA is bullshit anyway, but this one is particularly easy to prove).

there's a post on this sub RIGHT NOW doing that.  Also, Tone Vays does it.  
"Long candles mean buy" or some shit.  I'm paraphrasing.

I've had no problems at all with Coinme, tho I haven't used the new Coinstar machine.  Good company as far as I can tell.  
Now, this is just me, but I have only taken OUT cash at those machines - never actually BOUGHT bitcoin thru them.  The reason is I just can't see myself putting cash money into a machine and then just walking away with nothing in return.  Yeah, maybe that machine is buying bitcoin in the background... but who the fuck knows what it's doing?    
So, I would never BUY bitcoin at a machine anyway, but that's just me.

yep, I think you're right.  thanks.

Bitcoin trades 24 hours/day.  The wicks are determined by when you start counting a day.  Is it midnight?  Is it noon?  3:30pm?  Change the start of the day and you'll change the wicks.  It's artificial.  **The wicks are totally meaningless in this market.**
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:19:46
yes.. but the window is arbitrary.  If the window started at the "eaten through" point, the wick would be shorter.  Same data, different display simply because of the "time frame" you selected, which is arbitrary.

wall street sees the supply cap as a bug, not a feature.

You know that's a completely bullshit, made-up, meaningless number, right?
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:52:47
So the article is wrong?  I'm not even sure what you're arguing at this point.  I almost sounds like you're shrinking from the discussion entirely and just shouting "it's not made up", like it's not drawn from a hat or something.  OK, true, it's not drawn from a hat.  But the point is, it's inaccurate and doesn't mean what you think it means.  
What specifically did you find wrong about the article?  Let's smarten up all these people who got dumber by reading my comment.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:35:02
Sure it is.  It's derived from market cap numbers of all the altcoins which are in-turn, totally made-up bullshit numbers.  
explanation here (and you can find many similar articles) :[
Your thirst for knowledge is inspiring, tho.

Custodial solutions already exist for large amounts of BTC, and they offer insurance in case of theft or loss.
(I'm not 100% sure on the details, but I'm quite sure I've heard Novogratz and others talk about it.)
edit: here's some info from Xapo, a bitcoin costodian: [

So the CEO of a top exchange doesn't understand how Bitcoin works.  That's scary.  
Also, the minute anyone's stolen bitcoins get returned to them thru a process like this, that's when everyone's BTC goes to $0 because the entire FUCKING value proposition has vanished.  Dumbass.

It would be the first one in history.  They \*always\* rehypothecate.  It's their business model.

You're making a big assumption, and no other ETF works that way.  ETFs create new supply out of thin air.
