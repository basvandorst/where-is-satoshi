Andreas, how concerned are you about the traceability of bitcoin?  
I understand transparency is good for public uses of money to increase accountability, but do you think there are enough options for users to protect their privacy?  I love bitcoin and really want it to succeed, but I really don't want to see it become an extremely powerful tool of surveillance.

Nice job, now just rotate the thing clockwise like 35 degrees

TBH if that happens people will dump bitcoin and move to an unregulated coin

Thank you, this is a near prefect explanation, I think something people forget is before governments and societies existed there was anarchy and what came out of that?  Government.  We don't need to get rid of government, you really can't, what we need is better government.

I'm 21 and working on a double major in Physics and Computer Science at college, maybe Bitcoin will help me pay off my student loans!

In case anyone was wondering it actually went pretty well.
My main reason for doing so was to basically raise awareness of bitcoin and try to get some people interested.  I just explained the good things about bitcoin to them
 -Inflation Proof
 -Send anwhere in the world for a low fee
 -Account can't be frozen or confiscated.
Some of them we interested and some of them weren't but that's ok. Actually my grandparents were one of the people who were most interested and that surprised me, because they said their pensions aren't as valuable as they were before and so went I mentioned the inflation-proof thing it got them interested.
And for all of the people who weren't that interested I just told them to hang onto it and in a few years it'll be worth a decent amount of money, and they seemed to be pretty happy with that.
I disagreed with the people saying "just buy them a gift card, or something they can actually use" because they can buy gift cards with them anyway, and I fell like informing my friends and family about what's going on in the world is a better gift than just getting them "more stuff/money" 
Anyway that's just MHO, but again went pretty well for me and hopefully it did for others too

Haha no it was not, sorry to hear about that guy, but it actually went over pretty well for me.

I think "To the Stars" would be cool and general enough to use for a while.
