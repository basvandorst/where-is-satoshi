@_date: 2015-01-19 23:31:30
We don't really know. That is my point. The price could go to $40 and still drop more, or it could go to $1000 and keep going. There is no reason to think it will go over $1000 again just because it needs to in order to perform this or that function. The fact that it can lose most of it's value so fast is very likely to limit the amount of money people will be willing to put into it, or even *keep* in it, as we have seen.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:53:47
Wait patiently and we will be back to $32.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:07:45
The point is, that it only works this way in the almost non-existent circumstance where both the merchant and customer are bitcoin users and holders. Otherwise they have to go through the steps of going out of and back into whatever currency is dominant in their environment. Only at a bitcoin conference is bitcoin itself a dominant currency. 
Maybe this will change. I consider that a possibility, but not a probability.

Bitcoin is the shovel in this rush.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:00:54
americanpegasus, Bitcoins might be $60, that is a reasonable price. There is no reason to think if it was $60, that people would not sell more, that is still a billion dollars of value stored, twenty times more than it takes to send a probe to Mars. So it could crash to $60 and then still continue to deflate from there. I am buying a few more too but your mania is unreasonable dood.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:53:19
It's like groundhog week roun' here.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:22:03
I agree that to function at all like a currency much more value needs to be stored in bitcoin. My point is that just because it needs it doesn't mean it will happen. At, say $40, there are hundreds of millions of dollars of value represented, which may be TOO much, and $40 bitcoins might very well still be in bubble-land. Maybe it goes to $40 and holders are still cashing out like now and it goes to $10. Then you would have people on r/bitcoin still talking about 'cheap coinz dood!' At $800 people who said it could easily go to $400 got down-voted, and when it went to $40 people who said it could easily go to $200 got down-voted. And so it goes...
BTW I buy and hold btc, and still just laugh at all of the irrational exuberance around here.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:02:49
If it is that easy and they still have not done it maybe it's not happening.
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:15:06

Gold is a lot more stable than bitcoin. When was the last gold it lost 80% of its value in a year?
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:23:38
People will be more comfortable dumping large chunks on a well funded American based and regulated exchange. It will probably go down below 100, maybe about 40, and then recover a little after the block halving.
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:34:12
Which shows how much of the bubble is left to deflate. We are just getting started.
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:04:32
Slow leak down to $10-$40. Unless someone rich sells an oil rig or sheep ranch or something, and decides to go all bitcoin, or something else significant happens to drive demand.

And almost everyone esle, thus no new adoption and over 80% collapse is value. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:57:48
Also, do you have to report if all you have are losses? All I have done is buy a few things on Newegg and Tigerdirect as the price went down, so I didn't lose enough to bother claiming if I don't have to.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:08:42
It also gives early adopters with large holdings a safer and more legit way to cash out, so this works both ways.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:45:43
I think I will take your advise.

That is a huge amount to be put into an asset that can lose 80% of it's value in a year, or even half of it's value overnight. It's so fitting of this sub to talk all super optimistic like this and then spout of about "Pulling that number out of your ass with no justification".

@_date: 2015-01-19 23:06:08
TOO much in the sense that it is too much value for BTC to hold, it just might not be able to, based on herd mentality. 
It is not like there is some World Health Org that is going to pump money into bitcoin just because it needs it to perform some function. It either will hold that value or it will not, based on people's own self interest.
Right now there are multiple individual holders with enough bitcoin to crash it to single or double digits.

@_date: 2015-01-20 02:05:22
I predict this possible scenario if bitcoin gets another order of magnitude of adoption: If he still holds the keys he will wait until there is a good deal of use among unbanked people, and write or use a tool to look at the blockchain or some databases and get as complete a list as possible of all the active wallets, with bonus points for identifying addresses of unbanked third worlders using bitcoin on their phones, as they do now in Kenya with mpesa. Then use that list to do an airdrop distributing those coins, but with a twist. To counteract the inflationary effect he will burn coins simultaneous with the airdrop, in some direct proportion to the coins he is giving away, say a 1-1 ratio. Any wallets with lost private keys that he sent to accidentally would just serve to increase the proportion of the burn.

Me aslo.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:50:25
Yep. I bought at and through the bubble and downfall. I was pretty sure it was going to deflate, but I bought as insurance against the small chance that something unforeseen would come along and drive the price up many times. It has happened before. Bitcoin represents a relatively small pool of money, which means that it can easily dry up, but it also means that it doesn't take a whole lot of inflow to double or even 10x the size.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:49:39
Coinbase exchange is a great way for people with thousands of coins to unload, so expect it to keep sliding into double digits.
Edit: You culty fucks have been down-voting these comments all the way from $900, LOL. It does not stop the slide though, does it? We are almost there now.
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:50:18
Down 25% in the last 30 days, down 60% in the last 6 months, and down 75% in the last year.
Not a good store of value, and may never be a good store of value. These little bump ups that happen on the way to the floor don't change that.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:21:09
People who bought bitcoins expecting them to go "to the moon" will be tripping over themselves trying to sell for any kind of profit at all. Bitcoins tendency to lose 80% of it's value in a year will mean that any real upward trends will get sold into hard. If you want a whole bunch of examples just look at the last 15 months.

No actually, I only re-posted the comment *after* it was down-voted the first time I posted. And that proved how much people here *hate* critical comments, regardless of how realistic they are, which further illustrates how fragile bitcoin's value proposition really is.

@_date: 2015-01-19 23:21:07
But the same properties that made it crash the first time it went to $1000 are likely to make it crash again, if it ever makes it that high again. This tendency to crash is likely to severely limit the amount of value that people are willing to store in bitcoin.
It's like watching a tree grow and thinking it is going to be 500 feet tall in 100 years because it is 15 feet high after 3 years. There are limits to growth and size.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:44:01
k. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:06:49
There's a chance it won't go down, so you have some just in case it jumps up real high unexpectedly. It's like insurance against missing out.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:25:02
I never said the price was fair. If it goes to $40 and someone who has thousands of coins wants to buy something with then they will cash them in and the price will crash even more.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:33:28
Oh no! LOL.
It forced the discussion that the down-voters, shills, and astroturfers were trying to avoid though, so there's that.

Or that the atoms that form your body randomly rearrange themselves into a small green giraffe with a brain that happens to contain a perfect memorization of all classical orchestra music ever conceived. Also "possible". This is the kind of theoretical possibility that we are talking about when we admit that it is "possible" to guess a bitcoin private key.
