It was in may when not everyone was in Bitcoin like now. I got a reply in an hour at the time.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:19:36
I hope he is stronger than us tho. I once managed to forget I had Bitcoin in my wallet from 2013 to 2017. It is possible but really hard haha. I wish I could forget it again tho...
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:32:45
See you in 4 days! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:28:43
BTC and USD wise a big profit, I look at this BTC wise because that’s what I’ve invested. HODLING doesn’t give me more BTC like cloudmining does. :)
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:30:57
Becauce I didn’t log in for a couple of years (from 2013 to 2017) my account was suspended. Don’t you have the same? I had to send all sorts of stuff to them and they give me access back to my account. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:03:05
I used a tx accelerator and in less than 3 days after it got confirmed. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:36:03
Big profits, doing it for 6 months now and couldn’t be happier!
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:32:44
My boss at the time told me about Bitcoin. I didn’t know what it was and he asked me if I wanted to get paid in Bitcoin for the day. I earned €50 or 0,33 BTC per hour. Got 2,5 BTC and forgot about it for almost 5/6 years, I was happy to hear my BTC went from €150 to €1000 in may, since then I’m back in crypto! Still HODL the BTC!

You must be fun at parties.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:28:43
My transaction is stuck since the 5th of december... ��
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:28:41
Paid one I think, if you google it you will get the right ones. Dont have the link right now... viabtc tx id accelerator and coinex something if I remember correctly! Goodluck!
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:36:05
They can confirm it I think. It gets suspended after 1 year.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:21:14
I hope you make it, see you in 5 years!
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:28:48
Mine was confirmed this morning, it has been stuck since the 5th of december...
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:28:52
Making profits as well. My roi was in less than 2 months and now making big profits...
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:19:44
Doesn’t seem to help. :(
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:16:16
Maybe never. I’ve had the same issue (5th of december and still in limbo), now going to try with viabtc.com, the tx accelerator. Pretty desperate at this point tho...
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:12:39
Thanks,  but I cant reach the website?! 404 page not found...
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:36:16
Besides that, if you were able to you would cook your computer and will destroy it in weeks.
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:44:50
I just followed you, love your account! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:04:07
If I learned one thing after a few years crypto, then that would be to not trust TA. ����
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:17:30
Best TA 2018!
@_date: 2018-05-31 05:29:38
You have like a 12 or 24 word code. That’s what you need to recover the wallet. You can see the seed in one of the menus in settings or someting, not sure haven’t used Exodus for a long time. Keep the code offline at all times!
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:12:12
I don’t think that’s the reason. If I buy a Netflix subscription it is still not my money right? They are scared!
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:50:12
Moon! Wall Street bonus are in!! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:15:41
Im still waiting for Chinese New Year pump, or the Wall Street Bonusses. �� But... I would certaiy watch CNBC for slme crypto advice. /s
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:28:05
Chinese New Year is also today? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:41:27
Dude. I’m having breakfast! ��
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:09:55
It’s not, the last two days were just brutal.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:25:59
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:34:40
Can’t see another bear.
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:03:38
Don’t forget Chinese NY!
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:10:27
You wouldn’t have bought anything either even if he hadn’t listed BCH. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:57:27
Moon o’clock?
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:39:57
That’s right, my ocin!
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:13:46
Not all time low, just 2018 low.
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:59:26
The curve was at 6k while the price was at $20k.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:54:15
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:35:06
Payfair, maybe not instantly but probably the safest.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:00:07
I do. But if you own more than €23,000 you are considered as ‘wealthy’ so you pay an additional tax. Like a few percent a year. So just 36k wouldnt cut it haha.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:35:15
Or Idex. $20 for Trac.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:04:06
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:27:03
Haha, I’m just playing with you. It is visible. :) Welcome to Reddit!
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:26:39
Hate to say it to you but there are still 21 million coins, that the keys are lost doesn’t mean the coins are gone. ��
@_date: 2019-01-31 12:42:10
Also on Dutch radio, heard it a few times on Veronica!
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:50:15
Am I the only one amazed how old this looks? I’m 25 but this looks like the early ‘00’s!
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:46:08
Looks like someone is gonna eat some D!
@_date: 2019-01-08 07:46:52
Username checks out.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:50:58
Not even that! If I have €1000 on my savings account it is €980 at the end of the year. I only get 0,10% interest and pay €3 per month for my bank account. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:16:33
Really generous in these hard times!
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:15:59
It’s wiped out by the bot because you’re new to Reddit.
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:02:08
Better? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:31:38
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:29:26
I know it’s about perspective but it did tank like 70% since december. The price of 1 BTC october 2013 was also $1100...
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:24:34
A men can dream...
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:30:31
Haha. Then we have to pay taxes because we have more than €23000. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:16:01
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:52:01
Thats everything we don’t want haha.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:46:51
It used to, now not so much...
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:49:36
True. But people who think it’s a bubble will always show you the crashes and the times it goes bad. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:50:23
Absolutely! You should’ve done it a few times IMO. But some people think online banking is already hard, and that is like really well organized. Sending crypto is not on that level, yet. I don’t think it’s hard, but someone who is like 50/60 years old could find it hard to manage for the first few times.
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:52:13
Could be. But you can’t deny that it’s not that easy for new people, it really has a long way to go.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:09:32
And then they show you the december 2013 graph...
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:25:35
Marketcap and total supply are 2 different things. Bitcoin was like $300,000,000,000 if not more in december. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:25:10
Dead happens and it’s not waiting for anyone, not even Satoshi. He is still human. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:35:48
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:28:42
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:02:04
I just convinced someone to buy something with Bitcoin to ship it abroad (Ebay like website). Crypto really has a long way to go because it’s a pain in the ass thus far. ��
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:40:11
I FOUND THEM!!! [
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:31:32
No it was more like a cartoon kind of feel, thanks for the help tho! Haha, it is so weird to explain it because I remember so little. I thought I had saved the post, but I didn't.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:52:45
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:26:05
Bitcoin wise I’m at my ATH!
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:01:00
So was the Wall Street bonus!
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:57:47
29k and 170k, it’s below on the dickline page.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:34:42
Same shit different day.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:33:26
Wow. Best use for touch bar yet. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:59:45
I hate my MBP with touch bar actually. �� I’d rather had the 2015 model with usb and normal keyboard...
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:05:47
The very best there ever was. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:15:53
I’m a photographer and had to buy dongles for €100 and another cable for my screen; €50. Only because of the USB-C connections (i dont see any value in this type of connection vs USB). I hate the dongle life. Also, my keys are stuck sometimes resulting in: ‘bbbb’ instead of just one b. Same goes for the spacebar and 0. It’s a known problem, and nothing they can do except repair it resulting i dont have my laptop for 4 weeks. Which is impossible for me. Also I don’t like the butterfly key feeling. Idk. Expected more for a €4k computer tbh. ��
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:08:52
Depends on the fees. The lower the fee the longer the wait. Nowadays the fees are really low, but back in December I once waited 5 weeks for my transaction because the fees went bananas back then.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:56:09
Lately it feels like the Challenger rocket...
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:07:09
Another delay ��
