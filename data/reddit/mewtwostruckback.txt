If you put 900m into lobbying for bitcoin to be exempt from all taxes, that 100m would turn back into 1b pretty fast.

Run for office, funded by selling Bitcoin.
First act as President:  All cryptocurrency exempt from all taxes.

It's almost the entire point of Bitcoin to be able to move money from one person to another with minimal, damn near zero fees.  PayPal/eBay won't even relent on the fee percentages when using their services together (why am I paying a PayPal fee when eBay is already charging me a minimum of 4%?  They're owned by the same company - an eBay sale should include a comped PayPal fee.)
If PayPal does anything with Bitcoin, it'll include the same fees that Bitcoin was adopted to try and get away from.

It's sad to see you getting downvoted when you're correct.

I wish we could get away with the alternative.

But eBay will mandate the payment go through the  (with the retarded fee) in order for the buyer and seller protections to be enforced.  Seller sells and gets scammed and eBay didn't get their cut?  Tough, they're taking the money out of the seller's bank account and they're screwed.  Buyer didn't get what they ordered?  If eBay didn't get their cut they won't care.

When I made that post he was at -1.  I know fake downvotes are added when scores get to certain posts, but when something shows as in the minus, it typically is truly downvoted below zero.

Yep - the entire point is that we're supposed to be able to send one another money without paying 2.9% + 30 cents for the "privelege".
Now if Bitcoin being used negates the processing fee, great.  But that will never happen with eBay.

Well, I'd like to ban Russia by 2015.  And by ban Russia, I mean from existing.  With nukes.
Oh, that's unreasonable?  So is trying to stop Bitcoin in any capacity.

Use Bitcoin to buy weed and then smoke it.

The thing is, a good chunk of the reason people are even getting into Bitcoin in the first place is to eliminate or at least heavily reduce the fees involved in transferring money.  If you're buying the "bitcoin card" at a drug store, they're probably going to want 3-5% for the privelege of allowing you to change the form of your money.  Good luck convincing them to stock a product to allow you to get $500 worth of cash into Bitcoin for $500.05.
It should be that easy but if it's that easy it's damn well not going to be as cheap as it should.

Fuck the expectation that everything has to go to charity.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:30:13


That would have been awesome!
Nope.  
Use it for a contest for Simpsons fans.  People seem all too willing to throw gobs of money at things that say they're working for a better world where who knows how much of that money actually makes a difference, but ask people to put in money where it would benefit some average person like you or me and they scoff at it.

I figure future versions will have a pre-set bitcoin amount hard-coded into the virus...but have the ability to check certain sites that list average bitcoin prices and adjust on the fly, probably ignoring results below or above certain extremes.
They seem to know the $300 price point is how much they can begrudgingly get out of people, and $3,000 seems to be the max for the late-pay extortion from businesses that know they're fucked into bankruptcy if they don't unlock their data and don't have backups.  Their price changes are probably going to stick to those two amounts.

The people currently behind CL are only in the business of fucking and un-fucking peoples' data...if the virus is ever disassembled and others make variants, I would wholly expect versions that take the functionality of other virii that search for bank details/passwords, and upload those files to itself as well as encrypting everything.
I'm honestly surprised it doesn't do everything else you suggested yet.

Seconded.  In the US, the banks have tricked a large number of consumers into running their debit cards as credit, trying to say that it's safer - safer for the bank's profit margins, maybe.  The banks take on that zero fraud thing on credit and make the person pay the first $50 if their debit is compromised because they know eating that extra $50 when someone's card/card info gets stolen is enough to get people to run their transactions on the much higher percentage fee side of credit.
When I tried explaining this to people, the attitude was generally "it's not my money, why should I care if the business pays more?"  Well, they roll that cost into the cost of the item you're buying.
Honestly, I wish there would either be legislation to either require consumers to use the cheaper option for the merchant at any place that allows both debit and credit, or to require banks that allow their debit cards to be used as credit to only collect the amount that would have been charged on a debit transaction on all transactions, so there's no financial incentive for the bank to tell its customers to lie to those who they do business with.
