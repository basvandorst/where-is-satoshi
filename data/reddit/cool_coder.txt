Yep, those are within a minute of a previous block.  I guess tx's took a bit longer to package in those cases.

It's not conceding the name war.  Bitcoin Core=1mb blocks+segwit&amp;LN.  Bitcoin Cash=8mb blocks.  They're both Bitcoin, as they share the blockchain up to that point.  Unless one dies, they can keep their names as is.

Empty blocks are mined in the few seconds after a block is found but before the next one is packaged.  They're pretty rare and most mining pools don't prevent them.

Exactly.  There's no reason for them to not mine an empty block, any time without their ASICs mining is wasted.  Also it's not only when the pool mines the most recent block:  (AntPool mined an empty block after they received one from F2Pool.)

When a miner mines a block, their ASICs are still on.  It takes time for the miner's computers to package transactions into a new block for maximum profit, so they start the ASICs mining an empty block until they package the block.  Under some rare occasions they will actually find that empty block.

It's not just an Antpool problem.  If you want to be more profitable, you use spy mining.  It's a problem with the concept of pool mining, and not one that will be solved soon.

Who in the world is denying this?  They're obviously different things, and while some BCH community members like to call their currency Bitcoin, everyone accepts that BTC and BCH are different.

There's something I don't understand: what would segwit2x do?  There have already been some 2mb blocks.

Could someone please ELI5 as to what banning nodes means and why it's useful?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:48:18
Thanks.  I'll make sure to enable banning now.
