 **Absolutely YES**  
It is not difficult to make money day trading but most people go about it all wrong and end up losing money instead. The "secret" to making money daytrading is twofold:
**1.** don't get greedy and
**2.** correctly capitalize your positions.

 This is one of the best arguments for Bitcoin I've ever heard.

Hmm ! Absolutely Right,
Bitcoin's volatility makes it awkward as a cash substitute.  Every transaction is a gamble.  For the seller, they must add enough to cover possible losses between the time they make the sale and the time they then either spend the bitcoin or trade it for fiat currency.
