That does clear things up a little but I still don't understand how to know if this will be enough incentive for the miners.  In markets there's some sort of back and forth negotiation of prices between the producers and the consumers.  Is this where transaction fees come in?

That's like, just your opinion man.

I don't remember the forum discussion I was reading or where it came from but here is the article I read.  
From the article:
"Here's how the scenario - and the fork - play out:
It's as if Bitcoin is a show you recorded on your DVR. You hit the Fast Forward button several times, and hit play when you reach about 2140 or so. Everything appears to be pretty stable, and billions of people use bitcoin as their main currency every day all over the world. All the sudden, however, a story breaks in whatever form of media we'll have developed by then reporting that somehow, unexpectedly, those who still mine the coinless Bitcoin blocks for their transaction fees started seeing block rewards at the rates their great grandparents did all the way back in 2009. They were now multi-bit-billionaires!"

People who say "it won't matter because you will be dead" are wrong, because if this is really a problem then there be an incentive for a sort of rush to the exit, which would happen before the actual network dies.  How much sooner is too 
hard to say, it would be like predicting when a bubble would burst, but banks and businesses are not going to be interested in accumulating capital in a form which was hypothetically speaking certain to eventually implode.

As an ancap I will tell you I want whats best for the world and I recognize what works, what doesn't and why.

Obviously upvoted by people who didn't read the article.

I guess my concern then is that there will be money to be made, but not enough to provide the incentive to do all of the work required to maintain the security of the blockchain... I'm still trying to understand it all but I have had a difficult time finding solid answers to these concerns, but they may be misguided.

But... they will

Do you seriously spend all day trolling r/bitcoin?  Get a life!

People say the same thng about bitcoin all the time and it is easily swatted down, yet when mentioned about metals the people here actually support this reasoning?  Metals are just as divisible as bitcoin so that is not the issue here.  It's shallow thinking to say that there is not enough silver for everyone. If silver was as widely used as dollars then a silver dollar would be worth a lot more than it is today and the common units of exchange would contain much less silver.  It doesn't have to be silver dust or anything, as metals can be mixed together and made into alloys like the 50% silver coins which were once in circulation.

That is an individual's perogative, you can try to change their mind but you can't force it.

Frankly I would be surprised if it wasn't being ran with fractional reserves and out of player funds unless they've somehow verified that wasn't the case.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:01:21
I agree that could be a problem but it has been done before.

Yes the Big Mac index is a nice way to compare currencies but you have no idea where the rest of them will be when the price is at this arbitrary point.  If other currencies are in a crisis the value of bitcoin could rise in comparison due to higher demand for bitcoin.

Doesn't this very post about the Vice story indicate that people do get information about their food?

I don't know how to code or read code but will you tell me more about this when you get a chance?  I have played there for free and I had considered depositing before.

You're right but nothing holds "intrinsic value," only value that people give it for whatever reason, like it's useful, or aesthetically appealing, or valuable to other people.
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:31:16
My real concern here points back to what kind of role the core devs play in this and what power they have.

I don't think delusion is the right word there.  The faith that someone will accept it isn't a delusional faith if people actually do accept it.  I know what you're getting at though, it relies on a widespread belief that it will be accepted.
