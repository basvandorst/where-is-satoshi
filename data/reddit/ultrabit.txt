You can buy online at [ultrafitness.com.br](
Or you can come to the brick and mortar store located at: Av. Jabaquara, 1560. Sao Paulo, SP. Just tell the cashier you'd like to pay in Bitcoin.

Inicialmente a Ultrafitness nasceu da Ultrafarma, mas hoje em dia elas sao duas empresas diferentes e independentes. Nao tem como saber no momento se um dias eles vao passar a adotar, mas claro, se um dia acontecer iria ser otimo pra exposicao do Bitcoin no Brasil.

Thank you.

If you buy online then yes, you have to register. Unless you come to the store in person, then you don't need to.

I can't see why bitcoin wouldn't take off in Brazil in the near future. It has all the potential. I think once someone launches a good and reliable exchange for investors, plus a local brazillian Bitpay type of service, things will start to move faster.
I am with you, it is happening, at a brazillian pace but still.

Sim, eles estao usando o Bitpay e o proprio sistema fica encarregado de fazer as conversoes de BTC - Reais e vice versa.

They are using Bitpay. As far as I know, Bitpay sort of support Brazil, they just won't be able to convert BTC to withdraw fiat. So basically the merchant has to stay in bitcoins.

I'll have you know that I checked the title 100 times before submitting, yet I only realized the typo now that you mentioned.

Thanks a lot for doing this. I'll hand it to my brother your question about what system they're using, he knows better regarding that part.
