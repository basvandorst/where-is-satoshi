sounds like a whole lot of bullshit to me lmao

why is it bullshit when the only reason its gone up so massively is due to mass hysteria? The run up was just as equally "bullshit" as the trend now.

1) foreign currencies trade globally 24/7/365, this really isnt anything special to bitcoin. Also I dont see why this is a positive, stocks dont trade 24/7 because the vast majority of trading would occur during normal market hours anyway. All other hours are deadzones of illiquidity and knee-jerk fluctuations.
2) regulation takes away one of bitcoins central tenants. And it needs stability before it hits mainstream, not regulation. No one wants to accept a currency that can be worth 10% less tomorrow.
3) none of that is special to bitcoin. What makes bitcoin better than any other crypto?

52% 'dip' lmao the denial is real

so instead of a government regulating the currency, you'd rather a few billionaires with sophisticated mining/processing equipment that the average person will never be able to understand/afford to control the currency. How is this is any better? Honeslty it seems like bitcoin is the less democratic choice, youve just been sold the lie by wealthy elites that its the better one.

so instead of governments controlling the price you have billionaires with sophisticated trading/mining software controlling the price. How is that any better?
