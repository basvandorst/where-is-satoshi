The bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty every 2 weeks. Assuming this happens within a shorter time span than this, the bitcoin network should adjust down to compensate for this lack of hash power. The average block time for the two week period will be 10 minutes. When miners flock back to bitcoin, it will drop below 10 and when they go back to BCH it will go above 10, but it will average around 10 minutes.
I don't know what portion of the hash power is doing this right now, but unless it's very large I don't think it will have a big impact in the long run.

The peer relaying the block is not necessarily the producer of the block. Presuming the block is valid (which it is, or your peer would "Misbehaving()" the peer for giving you a bad block), peers will forward valid blocks they receive from other peers to each other. Don't shoot the messenger...

You can steal money
1. Start mining hidden chain.
2. Put 5000 BTC in exchange(s) (and spend UTXOs in your hidden chain).
3. Sell for cash.
4. Withdraw.
5. Reveal hidden chain causing reorg. Your BTC is "back".
And you can steal BTC by "taking it back" after you give it to someone in exchange for something in exactly the same way.

The problem lies
* in the whole ambiguity of this whole thing, as well as
* in the process at which S2X was made, as well as
* in the multitude of problems in the approach,
* the lack not only of consensus from the community but also the lack of cooperation with the core developers who were expressing valid concerns throughout the process.
To elaborate,
* It is ambiguous because they packaged SegWit and the hard fork together, as if they were in any way related; they weren't, except as political incentive (give us A (SW) and we give you B (2X block size).
* S2X was not made by the community, it was made behind closed doors by a small group of people. This on its own should make the community categorically refuse the proposal, even if it was a good one (it isn't), because that is not how a decentralized system like Bitcoin works, and if it ever ended up working that way a great portion of the users would abandon it.
* There are multiple issues with S2X, one of them being the replay protection issue you are saying will not be a problem (it will be a problem; it says 90% now, but once we get closer to the date, that number will start to drop and suddenly replay protection becomes an issue). There is a very good reason why Core hasn't done any hard forks, even though a lot of research goes into them -- if you screw up even a tiny detail, you will potentially have a network meltdown with nodes banning each other left and right and forks popping up all over the place. Not to mention the fact you are destined to end up with 2+ blockchains (even if 100% of everyone agreed, there would be that 0.049% in there that stuck with the old chain, and they may eventually gain enough traction to get the chain going again, even if it takes time). Despite this, doing a hard fork in the time frame suggested is irresponsible and reckless, especially since the big blocker alternative BCH is alive and (so far at least) well.
* The lack of consensus among the community goes back to how S2X was created, but basically: if you want to make a change that requires everyone to update their software, you should take responsibility and ensure the user base and developers (of software; not necessarily Bitcoin Core) are on board with your idea. As things stand, there's a bit of chaos going on among wallet software developers causing friction between them and their users, for no particularly good reason (see e.g. Breadwallet discussion on Reddit).

You've got it a bit mixed up, I think.
The second layer stuff will let me do things like lightning.
Lightning lets me make a one time "deposit" on the blockchain to create a channel with someone else, like Starbucks.
I can then use that channel to send bitcoin to Starbucks 50 bazillion times without paying fees, because it's simply a smart contract set up between me and Starbucks (it lets us abort and "put the state" on the blockchain whenever we want to, and every payment updates the state, and the state is in the form of a signed, ready-to-go transaction that sends each of us the current balance).
Once I exhaust my deposit, or once I don't feel like having a channel with Starbucks anymore, we close and another transaction is put on the blockchain (sending me my leftover, and sending Starbucks the amount I ended up paying them over the course of our channel's existence). 
The blockchain will only see two things: my deposit transaction (to set up the channel) and the final balance transactions (where we put the state on the chain, and then withdraw our funds separately).
It makes it possible to send 5 satoshis to someone a million times and then that turns into a one time 0.05 btc payment spread over ~3 or so transactions.

With the 2nd option, a very dangerous and presumably undesired precedent is being set: the miners control the network and decide its future. Not the developers. Not the users. Not the economic majority. If people get used to the idea that the miners decide the changes, we will soon see "with L2 tech, fees are too low to adequately pay the miners; we need to hard fork out the subsidy halving and instead pay miners 20 BTC per block indefinitely", and 95% of the miners will be on top of that, because as we have determined, miners decide.
I'm afraid I can't adapt that very well to your analogy about the road trip, but I guess going to 2X despite Core not wanting to means the miners are ultimately in control of the road trip and will decide everything; Core is just a servant fixing stuff up as the miners lead the way.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:18:23
Okay. Perhaps ASICBoost is turned off occasionally? Or perhaps they're not using it at all and I'm reading too much into it. (Does a block without segwit txs still have a coinbase commitment? If yes, indicative of asicboost, I guess?)
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:14:12
Blocks without segwit transactions are still able to use ASICBoost. This was purposefully done so miners who were opposing segwit because they wanted ASICBoost would stop opposing it. It is perfectly fine to mine a non-segwit block at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:41:37
If there's a long delay between, the reason may also be ASICBoost.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:58:47
In 0.14.1. See release notes here: 










I.e. miners can continue doing non-segwit blocks which means they can continue using ASICBoost.

Oh, okay, thanks for clarifying. I distinctly remember reading about explicitly enabling ASICBoost on the ML at some point but maybe I'm misremembering.

1. SegWit, everyone!
2. Huh. Miners don't like. Miners: "fees etc"
3. Wait a minute, ASICBoost and SegWit are incompatible. Is that why?
4. Miners: "... uh... fees etc!"
5. ~~Let's see if we can convert SOME miners by fixing ASICBoost. *inserts fix which allows non-segwit blocks after segwit*~~
6. ~~Miners: "... ... fees... etc..."~~
(Note: this is mostly about BitMain and their sub-companies, I'd say; I don't *think* other miners used ASICBoost, they were just opposing because of the investment into FUD)
To clarify, the miners publicly gave reasons for opposing SegWit, but (some believe) privately were opposing it because they discovered ASICBoost was incompatible; BitMain had implemented it but claim to not be using it; admitting that they were lying would be a rather huge PR blow so they didn't. ~~Switching sides after ASICBoost compatibility was "fixed" would be the same as admitting they were lying. Thus they opposed SegWit.~~
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:43:52
But fees *will* be cheaper. The original idea behind Lightning in the first place was to make microtransactions (down to a few satoshis) possible.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:45:53
If it's only a couple of seconds, it simply means the miner hasn't prepared a "real" block yet, and just lucked out on finding the next hash.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:14:14
I am pretty sure you're purposefully not understanding what I was saying, but let me give it a shot.
It's like a bitcoin transaction stream. But you only pay for the first and last transaction (in fees). All the rest are free, and the recipient is preset.
That doesn't sound super-fun, maybe. But there's actually more, because Lightning channels can (and will) be tied together, forming a sort of network. It may be a bit clunky at first, but eventually you will be able to set up a channel with a hub and then make payments to anyone you want, instantly (no waiting for confirmations anymore!) -- it won't be entirely free though, because the node hops will take a tiny fee, I expect, but it will be a hell of a lot cheaper than buying coffee on-chain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:42:20


No. You don't have to use he same path every time you update your state. In fact you're encouraged not to, for privacy reasons. Every payment will find an arbitrary path between receiver and sender and possibly use some algorithm to determine which, at the time, is the cheapest and pick that.


You have to wait for your closing transaction to end up on the blockchain, just like you always have. What about it won't be pretty?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:22:05
Was what a fix? SegWit was never meant to be a fix for AsicBoost, it just accidentally plugged that hole. And then the core devs unplugged it to prevent it from being a deal breaker. We still need to plug it or accept it as a necessary evil, whichever it is.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:46:45
"hold" as in, "don't sell, hold onto it". Someone somewhere accidentally wrote hodl once and it stuck. I think.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:35:35
You may very well be right about that one. I may personally be too convinced about it, to be honest, so maybe I should tone it down a bit. There's just a ton of evidence pointing towards it that I can't help myself. (You did know that ASICBoost is in fact implemented in BitMain's chipset right?)
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:02:05
Antpool is not including *anything*. So yes, antpool is not including segwit tx.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:42:52
It could simply be that miners haven't turned off bit 1 yet out of pure laziness.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:21:41
I got things a bit mixed up, apparently. (a) SegWit does indeed break covert use of ASICBoost, but it was *always* possible to mine blocks using ASICBoost, even before 0.14.1.
The thing is, it will become less and less feasible to do so, as more people use SegWit. The miners will have to drop all segwit transactions in the network, and forgo all the fees attached to them. If everyone used segwit (which is unlikely but you never know), then miners would get no fee payouts at all if they wanted to use ASICBoost.
As for (b), I can think of a couple of alternative reasons:
* They wanted to purposefully jack up the mempool size which would fuel their argument that we need bigger blocks (odd that no one is screaming louder about that one, tbh)
* They are spy-mining other miners' blocks (they don't know what's in the block they just know the block hash, so they can't adjust their mempool to remove the already-in-a-block transactions)
* They want to bump the fees for transactions by purposefully not including anything, thus causing the fee calculation to rise.
* Their software is buggy
Up to you if you feel more or less congenial towards them if any of the above. I think miners should at least try to propagate txs when there are txs waiting.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:47:10
Then again, it's very unintuitive to the average user exactly how destructive forks can be, so it's not exactly a good idea to be quiet and wait it out either.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:15:00
Right -- the discussion was centered around "no segwit txs but allow ASICBoost".
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:52:12
"The mempool" is the collection of transactions in the network that are unconfirmed. "a mempool" is a (potentially incomplete) instance of the mempool in the RAM of a bitcoin node in the network.

Cheaper relative to everything on the planet. Like, paying 5 satoshi to read a news article or something (at $4355 USD/BTC, that's $0.0002 USD, i.e. 0.02 cents).
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:28:55
Except AntPool is one of the advocates of bigger blocks, with the most prominent reason being that blocks/mempool are overfull. If they truly, heartfeltly thought so they wouldn't mine empty blocks. The only reason I can think of is doing it out of spite, or doing it to mislead the users into thinking blocks/mempool *are* overfull.
Nodes (miners) were supposed to help the network and get the coinbase + fees as reward for keeping it running. That's a big leap from justifying 0-tx blocks -- 0-tx blocks are purely destuctive to the network. Other miners worked for 9 or so minutes trying to shove more transactions into the ledger and that collective work was nullified by a "no change" block. If it was 10k blocks or 100k blocks or 300k blocks I might agree with you, but it isn't.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:41:46
Not crazier than people mining on CPUs and turning them off for 10 hours a day. When that was a possibility.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:37:48


Yes, establishing a channel (deposit) and closing it (withdrawing/settling) goes on the blockchain; the states in between do not.


That would be up to you of course. You could make a small channel if you wanted to. The opposite is of course true too (exchanges opening channels with you to let you buy (semi-)directly into your wallet instead of sending on the chain each time).

As long as your tx is a segwit tx, it will not be mineable except in segwit blocks. getblocktemplate will exclude your transaction for non-segwit miners. I.e. you already get what you want, presuming you use segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:57:12
There are no segwit blocks because segwit is not activated yet, so no.
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:13:49
Ohh, I get you. You can't do that easily, as nodes relay transactions between each other and you can't tell easily if a node belongs to a segwit-flagging miner or not. Even if you could, that node would relay your transaction to other nodes and eventually most nodes in the network will have it in their mempool.
To add support for "selective relay" you'd have to change quite a bit and all the full nodes would have to upgrade. And it would be trivial for miners to simply lie and say their nodes support segwit while not flagging segwit in their mined blocks, if they really badly wanted your transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:08:42
After some thought, the way to do this is to convince mining pools to accept transactions with explicit fees. Privacy considerations aside, it would basically work as follows:
- The mining pool whose signaling you are in agreement with offers an API endpoint or similar.
- You agree to increase the fee slightly for the service. In order to prevent a malicious miner from snooping it and stealing the fees, you actually make an explicit outpoint going directly to an address specified by the mining pool, with a tx fee of zero.
- You pass the tx to the pool and the pool includes it in their mined block because the explicit fee goes to them
- No other miner will mine it because the implicit fee is 0.
- Relay time is proportional to the mining pool hash power. I.e. the smaller the pool, the longer until your tx is on the chain

Let's say segwit2x has 60% of the users, and nos2x has 40% of the users.
Does that mean the nos2x people have to switch to the segwit2x chain? If you think it does, then we're in disagreement and we won't get anywhere with further discussion. You can stop reading here.
If you don't think so, then we get to a bit of an imbalanced issue: the miner distribution over these two networks will not, at least not initially, be proportional to the user distribution. So, we might have 1% in support of s2x, and 95% of miners still mine it.
So what? Well, the miners will just take all the transactions from the other chain and replay them on the s2x chain. To a new person, in particular, it will look like everyone is using the s2x chain, when in reality, only 1% of the users are.
The users, and by extension companies, will base their decisions on this apparent mass-migration to the new chain. It's faster, right? And everyone is using it. Confusion ensues, users lose money, and a lot of time is spent sorting out the resulting mess.
By having replay protection, you give the users the choice to pick the chain they want to be on, and not have that be auto-played on a chain they don't want to be on.


Hum. I am actually sort of hoping that they will turn out to not be criminals in the end, but you seem insistent that they are. My way of looking at it is: prove to us that you're not trying to forcibly take control by letting the users decide instead of attacking the network.


This is not the market choosing. See above explanation.


SegWit was a softfork. And you can still use the legacy addresses and tx system fine on the current bitcoin, so I don't see the similarities, tbh.
Besides, bcash came out without segwit; a clear market move that hopefully made *some* people happy, so I don't really see your problem.


I'm sorry if I missed questions. The answers tend to be a bit long winded so I lose track of things.
As for Core adding RP, to be honest, I think it will ultimately have to do so, but the problem is, it would require at least a soft fork, and soft forks would require time and miner consent in blocks, unless it was UASF'd, which is something I think everyone wants to avoid if at all possible, and the miner majority is not likely to signal for a change that would ruin their plans to, sorry for repeating myself, take over the network. Besides, a chain that is hard forking has a much, much easier time just writing it into the new consensus since it's hard forking anyway. Not like it risks a chain split, right?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:53:55
They want the world to think segwit2x is the new bitcoin. If it is empty *chirp chirp* no one will think so, but if they don't have replay protection, they can just copy all transactions from bitcoin and pretend that they were segwit2x transactions.
This works for ALL transactions initially, except when users forcibly split them (can be done, is a pain in the ass), which most users won't.
After 100 blocks have been mined on both sides, new coins are added to the system which makes the two chains diverge slowly, especially if the miner is willing to "mix" their coins with user coins to force them to stay in one chain. That's a big pain and the miners have to be cooperative for this. I don't doubt the miners who remain on bitcoin side are honest though, but it may be too much trouble to do.

@_date: 2017-09-30 11:11:40
No they don't. They will copy all txs from bitcoin over into segwit2x and keep on mining and collect fees. They will have 0.15 nodes running that relay all transactions over into the segwit2x network automatically.
Anyway, it's still unrelated to my question. Again: I'm not asking about setting up a node, even though that is of course useful, I'm asking about the viability of investing in mining equipment.
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:36:58
Serious answer: if bitcoin drops in price and never goes back up, then now is the perfect time to sell. If it goes up beyond its current price, then waiting until that point is better.
Anyway, relying on news usually isn't.. reliable. See the [Bitcoin Obituaries]( for how well that has turned out so far (bitcoin has died 160 times, and counting).
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:09:49
On splitting:
Assuming the bitcoin mempool has enough stuff in it, you should be able to make a minimum fee RBF enabled transaction on 2x chain that, once confirmed, you would RBF-bump with a different destination on the bitcoin chain. It could fail, but a failure would only mean you lose the minimum fee and have to try again.
(Reason why this would work: the 2X chain can do twice as many transactions and would presumably pick your low fee tx up before the bitcoin side did.)
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:56:14
You misunderstand: I'm saying it is an attack because it doesn't have replay protection. If it did, I wouldn't call it an attack anymore. I'm not asking the attackers to do me favors, I'm asking them to abort the attack itself by adding replay protection. As you say, they're free to fork off all they want, but don't do so in a disingenuous manner that tricks people into thinking the whole community is behind it when it clearly isn't.

The 2x code is deemed unsafe and unnecessary at this point in time. If the devs adopted it, everyone would also get the strong message that "if the miners want to, they ultimately decide the direction of Bitcoin". They stop being selfish for-profit entities that secure the system and start being the owners of the system. Not too different from a regular old bank, except for the huge waste of electricity.
If the miners are the owners and make the decisions, how long until they start nibbling on other things that would benefit their short or long term profit? What happens when the subsidy drops a few more times and the miners start insisting that fees aren't enough to cover their expenses? If they're the owners, they'll simply change the rules again to, say, add a permanent 5 btc pay-out alongside the subsidy. One more season of "90% of miners behind it, so grab the bull by its horns and adopt the change".

No it's not. Just because it's taken a long time to come up with a solution doesn't mean it's a cop out. And since a solution does exist and we have no way of seeing how big of an impact it will have, it's a completely safe thing to assert that it is, indeed, the wrong time to make a hard fork just to raise the block size.


We'll find out soon enough. Wish you'd insist on replay protection though. I really do like to have a choice...


It's taken to an extreme, I agree, but it's a valid point, whether you like it or not. This is about narrative and control, not about block size. See recent article on spam and other attempts to manipulate the users into thinking the mempool is full, or see the recent fees that get transactions through to see that a sudden increase in block size is not an urgent need whatsoever. 
We see what we see though. Can't blame you for that, really. I hope we can all find a solution that keeps everyone content and off each others' throats.

I think a general misconception is that copyright is magically transferred to the project. It's not transferred, it's shared. And it's shared with that project. Technically speaking, copyright does not transfer to new projects, so any forks of bitcoin (or any other FOSS for that matter) is partially owned by a (bigger or smaller) bunch of random fellows scattered across the globe. They are giving their gracious rights to the code, but e.g. giving a project over to the Apache foundation would have them require you to track the contributors all down and get their signatures on a paper stating they transferred ownership of their contributions to the Apache foundation explicitly.
In other words, code that goes into Bitcoin Core is copyrighted by Bitcoin Core, and the contributor. The license states that you can use and abuse the contribution provided you include the license, but this **does not allow you to claim copyright of something that you did not create**. There's a key difference, and this is why the copyright header can be a bit lengthy (note that it says Satoshi Nakamoto on one line and "the Bitcoin Core developers" on a second line).
tl;dr: you can use it, but you can't claim that you wrote it. That is a copyright violation. [edit: it may actually not be a violation after all -- surprisingly -- but it's an assy thing to do regardless]

It's not even finished so it's hard to say how it's gonna turn out, but I would say it's not going to be very centralized.
Anyone will be able to set up a hub. There will presumably be something like a DNS service or seed node (kinda like in bitcoin) that allows nodes to discover each other. That will be the most centralized part of it, but it's unavoidable unless you want to manually find other nodes to create channels with.
People will hop through random nodes (presumably by finding the cheapest route) as they make payments. The more nodes the better (more routes to choose from).

There is value in something that, despite holding value, remains secure. Bitcoin remains secure at, what is it now? $75 billion?
To rephrase: there's a $75 billion bounty for whoever can "break" bitcoin. (That's in theory; in practice, bitcoin would drop to $0 as soon as this happened, but still.)
There's also value in decentralization and trustlessness. A lot of people pay a lot of money to third parties because they need a "trust layer". By removing that layer (by removing the need for third parties to have trust), a lot of people can make a lot of money. There's value for you.
To take your question to its extreme: I can make a cryptocurrency where all you have to do is write "applepie" in your signature to spend coins, but it would be completely insecure and would remain at $0 in value forever. So "any function" is not really accurate.

I don't get why this is down-voted, as it is correct. The 0-conf thing for "low risk transactions" is not viable long-term in any way.
"Merchants can tell it is a legitimate transaction" -- no they cannot. It's not about what they "want". That's like saying "I can tell if you're lying, because I can do what I want." It makes no sense.

In an email 5 days to the Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup members, he wrote one thing in English, and another in Japanese (he said that the fees in Bitcoin are super high lately and that fees in BCash will always be around 1 yen).

Except a miner could take one transaction on one side and put it in a block on the other side and you'd now have coins in the same place.
There's a description using lock time out based on the fact the two chains will probably have different heights. That seems like a better way to go.

If you have bt1 after the fork, and bitcoin is completey replaced by b2x to the point where it is destroyed and ceases to exist, then the value of your bt1 becomes $0 and they are discarded automatically. If bitcoin chain survives, your bt1 are eventually converted into bitcoin on the bitcoin chain only (no b2x coins for you).
The same goes for bt2. If b2x chain never happens or if it dies shortly after the fork, bt2 tokens are discarded, otherwise they are converted to b2x chain coins, eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:39:17
I can't find it right now, but basically:
- you wait until the two chains have different block heights (one moves faster for sure so it shouldn't take too long); say bitcoin is at block 500000 and s2x is at block 500010
- you make a transaction with a lock time that makes it unspendable until the block height is 500010; this makes it invalid (for now) on bitcoin, and valid on s2x
- you send this transaction on the s2x net and once it's been confirmed and buried in 2-3 blocks or so, you make a new transaction which spends the same output but to a different address, and you broadcast this on bitcoin
The second tx is still valid on bitcoin because the first one was not relayed (because block height &lt; 500010), but it's invalid on s2x chain because the first tx is confirmed, so it would be a double spend.
If you screw this up, e.g. if you take too long and bitcoin mines block 500010 and someone relays your first tx, you just repeat the process until you manage to split. A pain in the ass, but it's doable.

It's such a niche area (blockchains / bitcoin / scaling / block size) that I doubt you'll find a lot of research (there are one or two papers though, but I don't know their quality or peer reviewedness).
If you sit down and do some napkin calculations and dig up some statistics on e.g. average block transmission times across the network, you will quickly realize that block size increase will impact the system in a lot of rather undesirable ways.
To take this to an extreme, to make blocks that can handle 7k transactions per second (visa level), you would build 150 gigs of blockchain data each day (300 b/tx, 7000 tx/sec, 86400 secs/day; that is 300 * 7000 * 86400/1024/1024/1024=168.9792 GB).
As transmission times for blocks go up, the centralization of mining goes up. Why? Because the miners closer to the "hot spot" will see the new block sooner and will build on top of it. Increase the block size enough, and fewer and fewer miners outside of the hot spot area will be able to compete -- they see a block for the first time around the time the next block has finished making. Even with just a few minutes of delay, this will become more and more prominent.
I could go on. I don't know if you need peer reviewed anything, you can just make your own conclusions from the facts that are available.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:27:54
Several really strange assumptions need to be made for that to happen in the long run.
Miners would have to be willing to potentially lose all their income since the activation date, because the legacy chain would be reorged out of existence (nullifying all their mining) once the UASF chain got majority. The only miner I can think of willing to risk that is Jihan, and only because he's desperately trying to get a hard fork done anyway, that would result in a split, regardless.
You'd have to be rather ballsy to assume that the legacy chain will prevail, considering a lot of the developers are pushing for the 148 chain and considering exchanges and others are starting to back it.

* Hard fork = allow something that was previously disallowed; will have two chains forever unless everyone in the entire world picks the same side (practically impossible).
* Soft fork = disallow something that was previously allowed; may end up with two chains unless at least HALF the mining population switches to the new rules.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:23:36
Depends on how much of the mining power switches over. You should note that any miners already signaling segwit will "sort of be on board" as long as the UASF chain stays longer, as they will happily build on top of it even without UASF code.
With 50% mining power on both chains, block times will be 20 mins until retargeting period.
With 33% on UASF chain, block times will be 30 mins.
With 25%, block times will be 40 mins, etc.
Weeks is an overstatement.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:39:55
You would trust people who invest in mining equipment to voluntarily lose income for the sake of.. what? There already is a minimum tx fee built into Bitcoin Core. Miners' only incentive is - and should be - profit. They shouldn't be moral guardians. If they needed to be, this project is doomed.

Confirm times will not be weeks between blocks, because this chain will have 2nd layer tech (segwit, lightning, ...) that will help it scale.

During the difficulty retargeting period, there will be some delays for a minority chain, but once the retargeting is done, it will be back to 10 mins/block. More miners does not mean more tx throughput.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:45:11
If none of the big miners swap the UASF chain will not survive. But even if a minority (say 40%) of the miners go with UASF it will survive basically forever, presuming the economic majority supports it.
As for your question, initially there will be a slow-down on the block generation because the chain is weaker, but the retargeting period will bring this back to 10 mins/block (on average). I.e. yes, the chain will be slower, but only temporarily.

1. ASICBoost is patented, which means it is enforceable through law. Any miner with it is fine, anyone without it is basically unable to sustainably remain a miner.
2. ASICBoost relies on some very flakey conditions which are (coincidentally) made invalid through SegWit and other proposals to improve Bitcoin. Most people believe bitmain et al are opposing SegWit simply because it would cut their (bitmain's) profits. In theory it would mean "no segwit, ever". In practice, bitmain and other ASICBoost miners will simply delay SegWit as long as possible to maximize profit.

Core approach: some person makes proposal, proposal is dissected and rejected or accepted, and once/if dev and community support is widespread enough, implementation is planned.

Funny that you mention this. People are upset about high fees, but if 1 BTC = $1, the fees would be next to nothing and nobody would be complaining.
By that logic, if bitcoin is really in such trouble as you seem to think it is, the price should start to drop fairly soon. As the price drops, the fees (in terms of fiat currency) will drop as well until an equilibrium is met.
The problem is, that equilibrium is already met. People are willing to pay tremendous fees to perform transactions because they are worth it for these people. (I'm not one of them. I'd love to see lower fees.)
To extend on that logic, the reason why fees in other cryptocurrencies are so much lower is simply because they are so much less valuable to the users.

BIP148 does one single thing: reject blocks that do not want segwit activated. That's all it does. After activation, BIP148 will continue to reject the other chain that keeps on building on BIP148-invalid blocks until the other chain poofs, at which point BIP148 ceases to have a purpose.

It is deemed an exploit for a number of reasons: it relies on assumptions about the block header which are rendered false by a lot of new technology, and it relies on government powered regulations through patents (point 3 above).
No one would mind if ASICBoost simply speeded up the hashing using a publicly available and free technology that any mining hardware manufacturer could implement at their whim. Because that isn't the case, it is considered a vulnerability.

1) I's not about storage, it's about immutable permanent storage with a timestamp that can be used in a court of law and that is available online and that will never disappear.

Yup, I misread the post.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:59:47
There's a fundamental issue that is being ignored over and over when these discussions occur.


Corporations and other entities will *always* be ready to pay up to a certain amount for permanent storage. They can use this in a variety of ways, such as proof of ownership or as a protocol on which other services are built or they are simply spamming.
I would be tempted to write "cflvx was here, 2017-06-14" on the blockchain if it cost me $.01, but probably not if it cost me $1.
I could run a business that lets people register a PDF and prove ownership. They give me a public key and the hash and I put those on the blockchain. They can later prove that the PDF is theirs by signing a message using the corresponding private key above. Great for copyright disputes or what have you. If I can sell that cheap enough, people would pay for it. (See e.g.  for an example of pricing for this type of service, in this case for DOI numbers.)
People wanting storage are, however, not ready to pay *any* amount, only up to a certain point. We could draw a graph with the x→ axis being the tx fee and the y↑ axis being the number of people willing to pay that amount to store stuff. It would look something like this:
        :
    v ↑|
    o | |
    l |  \
    u |   \_
    m |     \___
    e +---------→
          fees/b
As fee→0, volume→∞. Under normal circumstances (there are exceptions), everyone tries to get away with as low fees as possible. This creates a backlog of low-priority transactions which are deferred in favor of more profitable transactions. There is obviously a cap on this -- there is a point at which people simply prefer to wait rather than pay higher transaction fees -- and that point has turned out to be unintuitively *high* with bitcoin. This is coupled with the fact the BTC has tripled in value over a short period of time. I doubt anyone is sad about that part, but it does play a part in transaction fees as well, when considered from the perspective of fiat rates.
(Note that so far, I haven't even touched on standard transactions where A sends x BTC to B, the above is all about users wanting permanent storage.)
Let's go back to block size, then. If we increase the block size, we double the space into which transactions can be inserted. This will churn down the tx fees initially, but presuming you buy my statement above about the correlation between fees and (storage) volume, you will see that the storage users will fill blocks until an initial "storage fee equilibrium" is reached, which will be the same as it is now (for these users).
After this it's simply a matter of users and how much they are willing to spend in transaction fees. I am very hesitant to move bitcoins right now because fees are so high. I am not alone. As the fees go up, the number of people willing to transfer gradually drops. The graph for tx fees over btc transfer volume, if you were to draw it, would look quite similar to the graph above; if fees did get close to 0, people would be willing to spend smaller amounts of bitcoin for cheap stuff. (On-chain cup of coffee etc.) Consequently, the transfer volume would also rise in inverse correlation with transaction fees.
Raising the block size will give a momentary relief until the market catches up and then we will be back right where we started. It may be slightly less intense for a bit but, presuming bitcoin remains as attractive as it is (and most factors indicate it will -- absurd tx fees not preventing people from flocking to it being one clear case of this), it will soon be at the exact same position it was before the block size increase.
A block size increase is a hard fork, and hard forks have an inherent risk of a coin split. In addition, research indicates that the maximum block size that the network can sustain at the moment is 4 MB (this is why SegWit has a 4 MB max weight, btw). People, including Bitcoin Core folks, are trying to come up with a way to do this in a safe and seamless way, and have come up with several ideas so far. But alternatives which do not require a hard fork, like second layer tech (lightning), sidechains, signature aggregation via schnorr (via segwit soft fork of script version) etc. are simly more attractive at this point in time. These people take this limitation very seriously, and are dying to fix it just like everybody else. They just don't believe a block size increase will, probably for reasons similar to those I stated above.
Meanwhile, the proponents of a blocksize increase are yelling bloody murder while simultaneously mining empty blocks, and when they're not, they are happily collecting huge transaction fees. Meanwhile, they are blocking segwit, which, according to a lot of people, would actually fix this problem. That should give you an indication of what they are actually aiming at.
tl;dr: block size irrelevant.
Edit: deconfused.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:37:39


Since the BASF chain will start out with a 1,000,001+ byte block, all the succeeding blocks in it will be considered invalid by current peers, even if blocks mined beyond that initial point are all &lt;=1MB in size, because those blocks are built on top of this invalid block.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:24:07
1. Make a 1,000,001 byte transaction.
2. Mine it into a block on your new "must be over 1 mb" chain.
The above is sufficient to prevent your chain from ever, ever being reorged into the BIP148 or the legacy chain, because it is violating the 1 MB block size rule.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:07:16
I don't presume to know what the miners want. Some of them may want a bigger block size, which WILL require a hard fork no matter how you do it. They might think this is a good time for it, and start mining Jihancoins.

I'm not sure why everyone is interpreting it that way. To me it sounds like they're just FUDding about the purported SegWit patent held by Blockstream (there is no such thing), trying to scare the reader into thinking this is all a conspiracy and a trap by Blockstream to lure the innocent Bitcoin users into a SegWit enabled blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:47:09
That would be silly. BIP-148 is at risk of not mining enough blocks (missing activation period) if it gets too few miners; what you are suggesting would be a tremendous help to the BIP-148 chain.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:19:25
Good, except for the fact it's incompatible with a lot of the technology that the majority thinks will alleviate a lot of the problems we are seeing (not just scalability, but malleability as well). And it's patented.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:38:23
Miners have a few options on their table:
* They can continue as normal and follow the longest chain with current consensus rules [legacy]
* They can go BIP-148
* They can join the jihancoin, which gives them increased block size (more txs/block=higher fee payout)
Each has its pro's and con's: legacy chain pro is that, presuming BIP-148 fails, you don't lose any mining time, but the con is that if BIP-148 succeeds, your mined blocks go poof. BIP-148 chain pro is the same but the opposite, except it will never go poof (it may die if all miners abandon it, though, which is sort of the same thing); Jihancoin pro is that it gives them more space for transactions; con is that, if it turns out to be a failure, they, again, lose mining time and thus money.
If 2+ chains emerge (and they will, if the HF occurs), it is also a matter of determining which chain you think will have the highest value coin. Being the sole miner on a chain where 1 coin = $.00000001 is worthless if the competing chain has 1 coin = $3000.
So legacy miners might think that Jihancoin will prevail, because hash power and exchange rates seem to be fairly well correlated (I think?), or simply because they're believers in big blocks, in which case they would need to HF anyway. These people will presumably switch to Jihancoin. Presuming they're okay with Bitmain pre-mining it for 3 days, of course.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:44:52
They've always wanted to HF away from Core, and BIP-148 is a great opportunity to do so. There's already a possibility that there will be two chains, so they want to take control of the legacy-mining population.
It's not as stupid as it sounds, and I wish them all the luck in the world with their new altcoin. Maybe we can finally start to make progress now that they're moving on.

There is simply no viable solution for long term on-chain scaling. That doesn't mean Core doesn't want it. We all want bitcoin to succeed, regardless of whether we're big blockers or core developers or hodlers or exchanges. A first step in addressing the problem (SegWit) has been offered since last year; some miners chose to take it hostage instead of working with the community. We could have gotten so far in resolving this, but here we are. I think it's quite dishonest to blame Core while not blaming the aforementioned miners in the same breath.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:26:27
They only have to break the legacy/BIP148 consensus rules to ensure their chain is never reorged. Their new altcoin already breaks consensu by requiring blocks to be &gt;1MB; so mine a block that is &gt;1MB as the first block and then continue mining as normal from there. No risk of a reorg, regardless of BIP148 status.

Which is in reference to the "mine hidden blocks for 3 days" argument. They have no reason to mine hidden blocks, they simply have to make blocks &gt; 1 MB on their new chain and the BIP148 reorg risk will never be a threat.
