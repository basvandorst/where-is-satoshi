That still sounds like collective consensus of value, and does not differentiate it from bitcoin. As long as there's consensus on bitcoin's value, people will keep trading and using it.
If Trump was assassinated tomorrow, USD would lose value. If the US was nuked tomorrow, USD would lose value. If most of the government representatives were killed in a precision attack, the value of USD would plummet to near 0 because the government would no longer exist.
The valid argument here is USD is backed by a collective of centralised public individuals maintaining upkeep of value, where as BTC has a collective of decentralised mostly anonymous individuals maintaining upkeep of it's value. It's a case of who you trust more.

Literally burning people and buildings isn't something I can get behind. Particularly police stations. Murder, destruction and anarchy are only a solution if your problem is having a functioning society. 
The root of the problems in America is that political opinions are increasingly divided. People need to communicate and listen with empathy rather than sitting in their own bubbles and ridiculing the other side. If you think revolution is the solution here, then you're a dangerous person and are advocating for civil war.

Sorry pal, when you come at someone going "dawg I literally said what you said" and you in no way actually said any of what I said, I am going to be angry and call you a liar. There is no line you can quote that talks about empathy and political divide being the problem anywhere on multiple readings - and you're blaming other things, and clearly contradicting points I disagreed with. 
I gave a different opinion and you reacted by trying to be a smart ass. No, I don't care if you agree and I don't care to argue or come to a resolution. It's literally impossible to even have a discussion where you try to offer a different viewpoint and expect a rational response, and I don't care to try anymore.

I read over your comment again, and I don't know why I bothered, because you said no such thing.
Let me paraphrase :
Don't discount teens as edge because they're the vehicles of change. (I directly disagreed with this, and stated if this change were to occur as the teens it today see it, it would be a poor move and would cost lives)
Change it going to happen regardless of if I agree with teens or not and it's the masses' responsibility to implement this (I don't think buildings will be burnt, at least not with the support of the masses, and i disagree that this change needs to be implemented)
America doesn't like where America is going. The reason is because the people in charge are letting it (no, the reason is political divide and lack of empathy, which nowhere in this message is this to blame for you. You're blaming the older generation and people in charge)
I'd agree with most teen opinions if they were expressed more moderately (no I wouldn't, I'm directly disputing what you and those teens are suggesting, that there's some established elite causing this and they need to be ripped out and replaced.)
Edge teens are edgy jaded old farts are jaded, but they fundamentally agree and aren't arguing (no, they actually are, everyone is arguing. Even the 2 of us. If you feel I agreed with your message so absolutely, you completely failed to communicate yourself on every level.)
I really cannot grasp how you imagine I repeated your message. I disagreed with basically everything you said and you replied with EXACTLY, DUH! Maybe read over your own message again.

ICOs OK, but traders? I trade btc to fiat, I couldn't care less other than having to take a break and wait it out. Investors who were excited about a few percent gains yesterday have to contend to 10% down today.

You're missing the point. If the government collapses, the USD collapses. The value of the USD also fluctuates based on current events and has no set value outside of preception. Even the value of gold, which should have intrinsic value, goes to nil if there isn't a system to facilitate it's value.
I just find these distinctions kind of arbitrary. At the end of the day, everything has value if whoever you're trading it with agrees with you about said value.
In 50 years, fiat might disappear and literally be worthless, completely replaced by crypto. Or we might live in a post-apocalyptic world where nothing past water food and shotgun shells is worth anything. What we value now is completely based on trust.

I've made over 10x my initial investment with Bitcoin. Entirely during the bear market. I really don't think you have any clue what you're talking about.
At the moment, Bitcoin is about as valuable as Pokemon cards. If everyone decides they're bored with it, it's going to die because there's almost nothing underneath to support it's value. It has a bubble, the bubble burst, and to pretend it's somehow comparable to stable currencies, to which stablecoins are pegged to is beyond delusional.

I'm always amazed that someone bought at the top, and the entire way down they didn't consider that perhaps it's best to stop losing money and just sell.

That's a statement of what can be seen in hindsight from the present, not a prediction of the future. Asking a question of *what's going to happen* is a complete non-sequitur.

So yeah, when I say "i had an excellent bowel movement recently" I'm usually not talking about the previous century.
"Back in my day you could buy a large black rubber phallus for 3 nickels" There's a reason why people reference the effect of inflation as "back in my day" because it's measured in significant portions of a human's lifetime. Decades. Bitcoin hasn't even been around for a decade and has seen more volatility then USD has in the past century.
It's like they're not even comparable or something.

You're saying volatility contradicts the possibility of profit in day trading.
Volatility is the only way you *can* make money day trading. If the price is sideways, you're not going anywhere. If it's a gradual rise or slump, there's nothing to trade. Buy and hold if there's a consistent slow trend, or just wait it out of there's a slump.
Granted, I only trade a few thousand, no clue if what's worked for me would scale to larger sums.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:17:40
I had no reaction to the latest drop (maybe slight greed), because I had nothing invested and lost nothing. Now can start trading at the bottom, and volume and volatility seem better with people both FOMO buying spikes and panic selling at every dip.
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:54:03
Just make sure you get your correlation / causation right before making assumptions.
When the price moves, people talk about why the price moves or post news related to why it might be moving. When nothings happening, there's nothing to talk about. It's much more likely that reddit reflects market activity rather than the other way around.

LOL oddly enough I've been noticing a correlation with despair on reddit and market recovery. It's like an indicator that panic sellers who can't take the stress have had enough and are walking away.
The more people seem miserable on reddit, the sooner things improve in the markets. Maybe that's just confirmation bias on my end though. As a trader, I don't care about price, only movement, so I have no reason for false optimism. The current state of despair is telling me it won't likely it will go below 6k.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:23:51
And my point was that if I sell it for fiat before it loses value or just stay out of bear markets (as the title suggests I shouldn't be doing) I retain more value. I like retaining maximal value, AKA not losing money.
The OP is suggesting I should HODL through corrections for the good of BTC. I am not crypto Jesus. I will not let my financial security be a martyr for the progress of cryptocurrency.
Frankly, I think most posts like this are people soliciting for noobs to hold their bags.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:21:53




Are we talking about trading or investing here? BECAUSE OP's 6 months of HODL is an investment, not trading.
Yes, over the next 2-15, maybe 30 min, I can reasonably accurately gauge what bitcoin is about to do, as a day trader. I can gauge the risk of my next move and much much profit I might make and asses if that risk is worthwhile. If I'm wrong, I can correct for my errors and take minimal losses rather than having my eyes closed and praying to Satoshi. A few hours though? My success rate drops significantly. Overnight? It's almost a crap shoot. 6 months? LOL I'm guessing with the best of them.
There is no way I would speculate over 6 months with any degree of certainly. How many articles have there been from certifiable investment professionals saying bitcoin will go to 20-100k soon or the bubble will completely burst and bitcoin with go to 0. I saw literally no one predict that bitcoin would fluctuate and essentially remain at the same levels for months. You're lying to yourself if you think you know better than the financial and investment professionals who have no fucking clue where bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:53:45
lul wut? That's so easily abusable. Literally, who would telemarket? It's an industry which would never consent to this. Who would call soliciting votes for a politician? Who would call anyone they don't trust on a personal level already?
Plus, wouldn't the prerequisite of this be wide enough BTC adoption (basically universal if you want it to be tied to your actual phone  in order for both parties to have BTC accounts and be willing to enter into this contract?
Honestly, this is so poorly thought out, that I am genuinely concerned about the people praising this in the comments as not having the critical thinking to be putting money into something like cryptocurrencies.

I bought in March at 8800. Bitcoin is at 6500 today. I'm up over 400% from day trading and literally never leaving money in the market when I can't react to it. The only time I've lost is leaving it for longer periods and assuming the market will do anything predictable. 
I find it really distasteful when people pretend to be experts and give blanket advice in this manner. What you're suggesting does not work for me, and the exact opposite you advise against works wonders.

The only difference between doubling your money losing it all is timeframe. Timeframe is everything when it comes to trading or investing.
Maybe it speaks more to my skill set, but the only time I lose money with bitcoin is when I speculate over long unattended periods. If I look away and hope for the best, bad things happen. If I'm actively trading, I make consistent gains. Maybe that's just me, but evidence suggests no one knows what's happening long term. I've seen absolutely no one make consistent predictions, so I'm highly skeptical of using that as a strategy.
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:46:09

Well then if I trade all my money for bitcoin, then I am spending it, hence by your logic it is automatically lost. That or you think bitcoin is *money*, and then people who bought at 19k haven't lost money.

@_date: 2018-06-19 18:41:49
Uhhh, I doubt what I do personally would be an easy translation to the success of others. I trade on a smaller exchange with reasonably low fees and follow trends set by larger markets. I look at a bitfinex ticker and my exchange tends to follow that with a slight delay.
I don't leave money in BTC when it's in a bear market. I look for price spikes and buy early, and spotting that in mainly about momentum and a few other indicators that increase the probability that the price will keep rising. I don't have a mentality of holding it. I want to sell as close to the top as possible. Often times after a price spike, it'll level off briefly (usually the time to sell) before slumping and correcting back to a lower price.
I'll hold longer if it's a bull market and prices are more likely to keep rising, but there's been very few instances of that recently. I don't ever keep BTC when I can't watch the market because that's when bad things happen to your money. If there's a dagger, you shouldn't hesitate to sell ASAP. If you identify it correctly, you save yourself a lot of money for a small loss and you can buy in later at a lower price.
If there's moderate volume / spread with low volatility, you can time the market bounces / macd trends to maximise spread for scalping if there's absolutely nothing else happening. You have to be careful in these periods, because if you stumble on a dagger you should sell quick. On the flip side, sometimes you'll be holding for scalping and you'll get an easy price spike. Hold it long enough until that price stabilises.
Don't try to catch the dagger. I only try to buy/sell when the price is stable, unless it's dropping in which case - undercut everyone and try to limit sell, unless it's moving very fast, in which case market sell and dodge it. Sometimes putting an overly optimisitic limit buy will give you some really cheap BTC when someone sells a large volume of it. Rare, but kind of a free gift sometimes. Try to position limit orders just in front of walls and estimate how much the market is likely to go through (based on history and momentum) to maximize profits.
Basically, only participate when good shit is happening. If things look bad, stay out or sell fast. Do as few market sell/buys as possible, always try to limit sell/buy. Don't get greedy. Don't assume anything is going to moon. Assume all gains are temporary and you need to sell to make them permanent. Never assume the market is going to do anything specific long term, or else you'll end up convincing yourself that your bag is worth more than it is.

Can i ask why? Whenever the market is on a downturn, I immediately move it to fiat. It seems super basic to me to either be really cautious in a bear market or stay out completely and find a safer entry point.
Before I put fiat in I fucked around with a trading couple of litecoins I mined years back. Didn't take me long to figure out holding and hoping for a reversal is a terrible idea, and that  indecisive selling and FOMO buying back in is a great way to burn money.

It seems I went over 2000 total trades earlier today (kind of a milestone, thanks I wouldn't have checked otherwise). How many times do I need to do need to do this before the house takes it all?
This is really less a game of roulette, and more of an MMO game of texas holdem. It's not random, there's odds to everything, and you have the option of making smart bets and spotting bluffs.
The house does take something: 0.1-0.2% of each trade on my exchange. Past that there is no house, because I'm not betting against the bank/casino. The game is played against other people, and as long as you can be quicker and smarter than the majority, it shouldn't be that hard to return at least some profit.

I never hold overnight / long term (unless the market is bullish, but even then I watch it like a hawk), it's literally the only time I lose money.
I don't think it's the bottom, but I do think it's near it. I wouldn't be surprised if it dropped to the low 6000's, but if that happened as I was trading, I would sell way before I caught he brunt of it. I would be surprised if it went much under 6000, and I would be shocked if it went into the 5000's. The charts and sentiment on reddit are telling me it's not going much further down, but I'm admittedly much better at predicting short term movements than long term ones.
Are you using Quadriga yourself or are you on one of the tethered exchanges that allow Canadians? I've gotten used to Coinsquare, but I've been considering alternatives.

I still see correlation there, though most of the time it seems when reddit finally STFU price starts to recover. It's almost inverse.
The information this is giving me more than anything is that Redditors don't have any clue what they're doing in the market and have very little influence on price movements, other than panic selling. When discussions die down, price starts to recover.
Actually pretty useful info to gauge when people are likely to panic sell and to predict possible recoveries. When people stop looking at Reddit, apparently.

If you day so. I've had virtually no days where I've made a loss in 3 months in a bear market and I go out of my way to make safe trades rather than risky ones. I have no need for instant returns and if the market is doing terribly, I have no qualms about just waiting it out rather than chasing gains.
I don't really see how I'd go from 3 months of consistent safe gains in an environment where everyone else is miserable to losing it all a year from now. But apparently you know everything, including my impending failure so I do t know why I'd argue with an oracle that has seen my fate.

Or you could have gotten an account on coinsquare and paid a 2.5% deposit fee and bought at market value. As of this minute, it's trading at 6550 cad, which is around 5000usd, $200 below most major exchanges because everyone is panic selling.
13% fee is pretty fair though I guess.
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:22:46
Brace yourself, to stay at 6400 for many more months.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:25:40
I tried that. They all follow BTC very closely and the divergence is very slow. If you actually want to day trade, having a stable currency to sell to is fairly important.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:57:02
My mistake, I ended up with 9.4% gains by the time I went to sleep by cashing in on the rush to 7200 before it went back down to 6900. 
Good to know my success rate has increased so dramatically from 99% failure. I do believe you're quoting success rates of new traders and people betting on margin though. I wound recommend you put some money aside and actually try your hand at anything but hodl memes. I know reddit is trying to convince you to keep the price high for them my not selling ever, but maybe you actually like keeping your money? 
I do not understand your problem. If you have 1 bitcoin you bought at 8k, and sold it at 7600, you have 7600 usd. When the price then hits 6700 and stabilizes, you can then buy 1.1343 bitcoin with that money. Once the price returns to 7600, the point where you sold, you will be holding $8620 usd in value. Or $9047 when it goes back to 8k. I don't know how your brain convinces you this is a loss of 5%. 
Only if you fail horribly by panic selling at the wrong time and the price ends up going up immediately after you sell do you lose that 5%. I don't use TA, I only gage the momentum and mood of the market. If people are selling / buying and the price is spiking with a certain fervor (you really have to know how much spiking to ignore as a trap) you can save yourself a lot of money by swinging with the market.
Aside from that, as long as you know if the sentiment is generally bullish or bearish you know if it's generally safer to hold or btc or usd. There's little more to than than looking at which way the market is sloping in the past 12/24 hours. If it's sideways, you can fairly safely try to trade by buying slightly lower and selling slightly higher than marker value as it spikes up and down but remains stable.

The guy I was replying to before you came in said "crypto will still work" after talking about the fall of fiat, after which you decided to come in and defend him. You are, by proxy, defending his position, which was in the event of a USD collapse, crypto will somehow be your salvation.
If your position is a USD collapse is imminent, and leaving the country won't save you, and crypto won't save you, then you're a nihilist that just thinks a societal collapse is inevitable. Why the fuck are you wasting your time in a crypto Reddit instead of prepping and stocking up on supplies?

The probability of USD collapsing to the point of being unusable is miniscule compared to this happening with crypto.
I think there's a good chance that there will be eventually a crypto which sees very wide use. There's no reason to believe that this will be any crypto which exists today. All of them can fade into antiquity. While USD can lose it's dominance, it's not under threat to be supplanted by another US fiat.
You're spinning the roulette wheel and telling me it's going to land on 0 eventually so might as well start betting on it now. Well sure, the sun will swallow us eventually and USD won't be worth anything, but that being an inevitability doesn't mean that betting on an immediate collapse is in any way and wise choice.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:06:26


Really? How's that price floor working out so far?
I trade, and I had it all in fiat when this last drop happened. I could buy now for a 15% discount, but unless the price starts spiking, I won't, because there is no price floor. Descending wedge broke from the bottom, and I would anticipate things going south unless this is all an anomaly precipitated by the BCH fork / hash war.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:08:56


The scenarios you present necessarily involve the trader making poor choices. I'll still entertain it though. Your actions would have still resulted in your account essentially completely ignoring the value drop between 7600 and 7000. It's as though it didn't happen. The market didn't go down for you while it did for everyone else.
I'm not sure where the numbers for the losses come in, but if you panic sold before it hit bottom, and bought back in at a lower price, you would STILL HAVE MORE BTC THAN YOU STARTED WITH.


You might not have the requisite math skills to be doing this on any serious level. You're not buying at 8k. You have BTC that you're holding already. The price is going to 6700 from 8k. Let me try once more to break it down.
**HODLR:**  
Holdings is 1.00 BTC @ 8000USD.  
Price drops sharply to 7600.  
HODLR ignores and continues.  
Price hits 6700. HODL is HODLing.  
Price rebounds, goes back to 8k. HODLR is super relieved.  
HODLR still has 1BTC @ 8000USD. You win because you held strong and didn't lose anything, right?
**Trader:**  
Holdings is 1.00 BTC @ 8000USD.  
Price drops sharply to 7600.  
Trader sees a crash sells at 7600 converting to 7600USD @ 1 BTC.  
Price hits 6700. You still have your 7600USD. 7600/6700=1.134.  
You can now buy 1.134 worth of BTC with the fiat you've been holding as the price was dropping.  
Trader sees that the drop has stopped and converts 7600 USD to 1.134 BTC.  
Price rebounds to 8k. While HODLR did nothing, trader got to dodge most of the dump.  
At a price of 8k per BTC, Trader now owns 1.134BTC valued at 9074 (1.134x8000).
In those 2 scenarios, despite the fact that one of those people has a thousand extra dollars, you're still telling me that Mr.HODL is the real winner because he chose to do nothing and used his strength and willpower to instill inaction in himself to avoid protecting his money?
You know how you always hear buy low and sell high? This is exactly what's happening here, except instead of buying low and selling high as the price is rising, you're doing it as the price is dropping. In this scenario, 8000 is as high as it's going to get. 6700 is as low as it's going to get. You sell as close to the top as you can when the drop starts, and you try to buy back in when it stops spiking downwards. As long whatever price you're buying back in at is lower than your sell price + fees, you're making more money. You're buying at a discount.

KYC was automatic and completed same day from what I remember. I didn't have to provide any ID. Doing it from my home is easier then going to an ATM. Unless your usecase demands anonymity, I don't see the advantage of overpaying from a retail location over just buying online at and getting 20-30% more BTC for your money.
Even if you need anonymity, you could just wash it through a xmr / dash / zec. There are better options, you simply choose highly inefficient way to impulse purchase BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:38:57
It will still work, with no one to accept it. Again, if people can't get money out of their bank accounts, there will be riots and anarchy. People will be looting stores, not setting up to accept crypto payments. If no one is accepting crypto or converting it to fiat then it has 0 value.
There might be some value still internationally, but it would be hard to cash in on that value if you can't even buy a plane ticket. Again, if you legitimately believe this, then you shouldn't be in the US. I'm sure the impact would be global, but the fallout would be the worst in the US. You'll still be able to use your money when it isn't in USD.

I feel like I explained it to you like 3 times at this point and you're still not understanding basic math. Perhaps it's best you don't do day trading in this case. The mindset you have is that selling at a lower price is losing money and admitting defeat / failure regardless of the fact that I literally told you that you'll have more bitcoin by the end of it.
In the last 100 or so trades the worst I've lost in a trade is maybe 1%, and it's always been on days where I've made trades in the positives that far outweigh that. I've never had a losing day. I always trade from a position of safety and minimal risk. Either I'm extremely lucky, or 1 in a hundred, or perhaps you're falsely convincing yourself that your inaction is the correct choice.
Frankly though, at this point, if you don't understand how selling higher and buying lower is of advantage and not a loss, I don't think it's a good idea for you to even attempt anything but holding.

Put in money 2 weeks ago at 8800. If I held instead of trading, I'd be down 25%. Instead I'm up 40%.
Watched it drop from 7600 to 6700 today while laughing. Gained 6%.


No trading experience / education other than just practising with small amounts over a couple of months. I would suggest you stop blaming people who don't use memes as an investment strategy and maybe have the presence of mind to at least short when the market is plummeting like it was today.
If it drops from 8k to 7.6 in a couple of hours, sell it. Get off the ride. Wait until the ride comes to a stop, get back on at at a cheaper price. If you sold at 7600 and bought right now, you'd be holding at least 10% more bitcoins for almost no effort.

The argument you're making is that a specific number is going up fast and it's impossible for that to change. How did that attitude work out for people who put money into BTC in December and decided they were going to HODL? Finance does not travel on 1 direction only, and certainty of that degree is unfounded.
If USD crashes to the point of not being able to withdraw, you're going to have significantly bigger problems than worrying about your bank account. That would end in civil war, riots and anarchy. No one is going to be selling you groceries and supplies over your phone in exchange for your dogecoin at that point.
If you legitimately think the US economy is going to collapse, the solution isn't crypto, the solution is to leave the country. Crypto won't save you from a failed state.

There's apps that can give you alerts when the price changes a certain percentage within a short time span:   
I find it tragic that I can't explain to you that what you're doing is borderline identical in outcome to sitting around with a bunch of USD waiting to buy the dip. Except you're literally dodging the dip as it's happening and entering the market at a lower price, as though you bought the dip at the value of your bitcoin before the dip happened.
Imagine buying BTC for the first time at 8k, and it immediately drops to 6.7 and you go "shit I wish I waited and bought it then instead" YOU CAN LITERALLY DO THAT IF YOU SELL AS THE DIP IS HAPPENING.
Well I give up. Good luck with your investment.

Odd that no one mentioned the BCH fork... There was a branch of Bitcoin that split off a while ago and has been in the top 5 spot (Bitcoin Cash). It stemmed from a disagreement about what Bitcoin should be and if it's true to the original vision of the whitepaper. Well, the people in charge of that split off branch of Bitcoin could not agree between themselves what BCH should be, so that was split off also into BCH ABC and BCH SV. The people involved had a lot of influence in terms of mining power and mining pools, and the accepted theory was that whichever of those forks of BCH had the most hashing power post-fork would be the winner and would be the accepted standard BCH.
Well, the ASICs that mine Bitcoin can also mine BCH, and what happened and is still happening, is a hash war. Mining hardware was pulled off mining bitcoin to mine BCH to secure a winner in this war, which triggered uncertainty in the market.
This happened after the price of BCH spiked, as the fork announcement was widely known, and after the fork, you get to keep both branches of BCH effectively doubling your crypto, but at the same time, the price spike is artificial and greed driven, and after the fork occurs, the price can't stay that high, so people sell it off ASAP because they only bought in to grab some profit off it. Huge selloffs in one crypto can often instil panic elsewhere.
It's a lot of factors, but I think the BCH fork injected panic where it didn't need to exist.

I'm not sure you understand how math works. This shouldn't be this difficult. Yore presenting me with some ridiculous scenario that doesn't represent reality. 
I'm not claiming I sold at 7600. I sold around 8500 the night before the slump, stayed out most afternoon, and didn't buy until it started stabilizing back from 6700 around 6900. Not only did I make almost 10%, when I choose to eventually buy back in fully (not trading today I'm out visiting family) I will buy back in at a lower price with 10% more fiat than I had before. Even if it went to 9000 before I bought back in, I'm still in a substantially better position than if I just held. 
What I was saying was, if YOU had sold late at 7600 and bought back in a day later when things stopped being a complete dumpster fire, you could have saved a lot of money rather than just convincing yourself that holding is the right tactic.
I think you telling me that traders lose 99% of the time and that it's best left to others is the excuse you use to keep yourself in the position you're in. It's something you have to practice and have confidence in, but sitting by watching the market leave you with a bag is just not smart.

You both failed to accurately interpret what I said, and what you did interpret was twisted to be something nonsensical.
I did not say factor out 90% of remaining days, I said factor out the bad ones, as in the downward price spikes. If one is trading, they do not magically incur all the negatives while missing out on the positives. They try to minimize one and maximize the other. Factoring in only one is asinine if you're trying to make a legitimate case for HODLing. 
You then took that and further butchered it to mean a trader who selectively puts money in bitcoin is somehow someone who does not participate in bitcoin, and using that logic they cannot make money off bitcoin (???)
It certainly didn't go well for me to talk to someone who lives in an alternate reality. Thankfully the article actually answers my question:




To me, this this isn't a case for HODL like it seems to be for everyone else. It actually says HODL is a fucking awful strategy and you're better off just going all in on days where the price is spiking, because the rest of the time you're literally just losing value.

It would seem that market fees play a big role, and my exchange doesn't have particularly high ones. I would likely be losing money if I picked the next closest exchange in popularity due to their fee structure.
Also, the market's been in bear mode ever since I entered, so I guess it makes sense. I could see how being overly cautious like I normally am would end up being a disadvantage in a bull market. My trading strategy would definitely under-perform HODLing in bull markets, but that's kind of a far cry from "95% of traders go bust" hyperbole that I keep hearing.

Yeah I've read the story about missing the 10 best performing days. My take was, it ignored also missing the 10 worst performing days and assumed you lose out on all the good while taking all the bad, which is super biased.
On top of that, it also said the days outside of those 10, holding BTC is basically pointless. You would lose money, but you should HODL just in case so you don't miss those days. Hence, if you're a vigilant trader, you can make all the profits off those 10 days. It didn't sound like a good case for HODLing to me personally if 97% of the time you're just slumping in value.
I think you might have gotten the sentiment TA correlation backwards:


That would seem to imply that I should be doing poorly now shouldn't it? We've been kind of in a bear market since I entered (March) except for that one run to 10k. Still consistent gains throughout.
Today I made 2.4% off the spike in BTC, then converted back to fiat at the top (was literally $5 from the top sell in my exchange, luckier than usual) now it's slumping and I'm missing 100% of it. Spent 10 min paying attention to the market, been basically ignoring it ever since. I'll just get to buy in with more money on the next spike or when sentiment starts to improve.
Anyways, nice chat, a lot of interesting links, though I feel like a lot of them are really geared towards more slow-moving stock TA which is a bit different than the volatility of crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:42:37
I only skimmed through and will need to give it a full read later. Thanks for the link.
Initial impressions are that clients of Dutch discount brokerage who use nothing but TA on lottery stocks tend to lose more than those who actually invest based on the value of stocks long term. That isn't surprising, because they basically picked people who essentially want maximal gains in minimal time without knowing what it is they're putting money into.
It doesn't really corroborate the claim I keep hearing that "95% of traders lose it all" repeatedly. It corroborates the fact that greedy people who want to make a quick buck end up losing it over those who take it slow and think about what they're doing.
People who HODL tend to try avoid thinking about what they're doing altogether. It's quite possible for one to trade for small gains safely without throwing their whole stack into the newest trending ICO every week.

Yeah, I do fiat to BTC. Alts tend to follow BTC too often, and then you're relying on 2 unstable variables rather than one. Going BTC -&gt; ETH doesn't do anything for you when the whole market is crashing. If you do trades to fiat, you can make money the whole way down any time there's a spike/trap/panic sell. If you're trading between 2 cryptos while everything's in flames, you're still in the dumpster at the end of the day.
I put in money at 8800, and by the time BTC slipped down to 6800, I doubled the fiat I put in. Maybe that's doable with BTC to alts, I just haven't had as much luck. I find this much more intuitive and controllable.

You're a bot trader, making more money than you need, preaching to someone who's been doing this for a month about how virtuous they are to DCA out at the bottom of crashes and being slightly inefficient. How generous of you. Good to know you're not a twat like me.
Even the HODLers are here to make money. They're not talking about lambos to save the world, they just suck at trading and their reasons  for not doing it is "you'll crash your portfolio in a month" and "99% of traders fail, don't do it "
Now the bot trader is telling me I'm a bad guy for spending 10 hours trading to make a few hundred. Yeah alright pal, I can feel the virtue seeping off of you. Maybe one day I'll be saintly enough to not give a shit how sloppily I exit the market with my bounty of profits and then I'll be a good guy too.

Literally a comment you posted yesterday:


Absolute hypocrite. Nowhere did I say money is everything to me. You *literally* said you make more money than you need. You're projecting **REALLY** hard in this whole thread about your own insecurity about how you make your money, while at the same time bragging about how you make money in basically every other thread I've seen you post in.
You are an insecure man who's itching to criticise your own behaviour in others. Except I'm not farming bitcoin with bots, I'm trying to help my GF pay off her college loans and lines of credit. I'm nowhere near making "more money than I need" yet here you are, telling me I'm shit for making a fraction of the money you make. What's relevant isn't how you trade, it's how much money you're taking off of someone else. This shit is a zero sum game for traders, all the money is someone else's money, but apparently you feel no guilt because it's all Roger Ver &amp; friends' money, and they really don't need as much as you.
If it makes you feel better, I DCA'd buy-ins from 9300 to 9150 overnight when it was at 9400 and it dropped to 8900 by the time I woke up. LEL. I already made it back, but hey, I traded like an idiot which you seem to advocate for, happy friend?
Honestly, I doubt any of this has anything to do with how I trade. I think you just have a compulsive need to shit on how other people trade to puff up your own ego. I think you go out of your way to squeeze every dollar out of every trade, and you just want to shit on someone who's potentially a competitor. Maybe try to catch a few less falling daggers and learn from your mistakes instead of projecting all this insecurity publicly on to reddit.
Good luck with your Lambo and your guilt over how you make a living. Sorry if I don't share in that guilt.

Trader here. The only thing I care about is movement, not price. Doesn't matter if is $2000 or $10000, if it goes up 5%, I make that on my holdings. If it goes down, I short and buy as close to the bottom as I can.
Buying at the top and holding is obviously a terrible idea, but if you're trading, you do your best not to end up holding a bag when the price starts dropping.

You do you pal. If you want to be a crypto hero, buy the dip and HODL. I'm not here to save the world. I think most people are in this to make money. I don't at the moment make more than enough money and I don't trade with a bot. I trade a couple of grand that I made with a couple of hundred I put on not too long ago.
I have no issue with shorting at the top of every spike and scalping when things are going sideways. Maybe when I'm at the point that I can pay off my regular debts and make more than enough as a job, I can be less aggressive about this, but I don't feel I have a reason to feel bad about making 15% of my holdings a day by trading like a dick.

The term least intelligent implies he acknowledges there's more intelligent friends also.
Are you implying all of his friends are equally intelligent, or that people are not incapable of gauging the intelligence of others?
Is someone liking headlines you've already read generally a sign of their intelligence? The article claims bitcoin's value is linked to it's mining cost, which he assesses is around 5k. Except there was just a 15% difficulty adjustment, making that whole article moot. A person who's actually up on crypto would know this, but clearly not a person who's linking random alarmist articles with the perception that they have some insider info. To me, categorising that as less intelligent is a reasonable assumption. Do you disagree?

I don't think there was anything originally mentioned about 2 groups. He said least intelligent. I would assume he's implying a spectrum. People are on an intellectual spectrum, whether you think that's rude or not. Acknowledging biology might be rude to you, but that doesn't make it not true.
Dude also never said anything about rungs on a ladder or competing for intelligence with his friends. He just stated some of them are smarter than others. What part of this statement is objectionable?
If I have a neighbour who literally has down syndrome, and I'm friendly with them, are you telling me I'm supposed to pretend he's the same intelligence as everyone else or else I'm an asshole? Clearly, you treat them with the same level of respect as any other human, but the science on the impact of down syndrome in terms of intelligence isn't controversial. Don't make me wikipedia you. I would assume they're going to struggle and perhaps offer to help with certain tasks based on that assumption, that's an acknowledgement of his deficits. At this point you seem to just be in denial of science and reality.


You didn't capitalise the acronym or the I's, you didn't use punctuation, you misspelled realise and had a typo on sorry within barely a sentence, and you're calling me a child and linking people to dunning-kruger.

I put in the only fiat I spent around 8800. The price right now is around 3400. I've withdrawn more than double my initial investment from my exchange already. I still have more than 10x the initial amount in my exchange, still making trades that increase my holdings.
I now have the capacity to buy about 30x the BTC today that I bought initially in March. How much would I have again of I HODL'd from 8800 again? Oh, 38%? You're telling me this would have been the better outcome? Ok pal. You do you. I think I'm going to skip the memes as investment advice for now.

All the price movements are amplified because the BTC:USD ratio is so off compared to what I'm used to.

Ok, so acknowledging some of the people you know in person are of lower intelligence than others you know: **bad**.
BUT, accusing random strangers on the internet of not knowing their friends better than you do while at the same time assessing the intelligence of those strangers yourself: **good**.
So contemplating the intelligence of others in basically any form makes you a stupid asshole... Unless it's strangers on the internet, and you only have a few sentences of info to go on. Is that the general idea? That's all I can really parse from what you've given me.
Wait, "statistically speaking"? Can I get those statistics? I'm sure you wouldn't misuse terms like "statistically speaking" and not actually have anything approaching statistics on the topics you're discussing. I would love a statistical analysis of the correlation between people that judge the intelligence of their peers and the IQ of the person doing the judging. That sounds like a fascinating study, can't wait for you to link it to me.

So you probably could have made around $60 then in a month or 2, now you're losing a couple hundred instead. I would suggest you try to think of that as a few hundred invested into a learning experience. An opportunity missed due to greed.
That's being said, $80 isn't a significant quantity to even contemplate honestly. If that few hundred is something that bothers you, cash out and you can stop thinking about crypto and move on. Honestly, I would consider it already lost and check back a few months later. I wouldn't be expecting to break even anytime soon by then if i was you.

Ben Shapiro is pretty cool actually. Facts, in fact, do not care about your feelings.
A lot of feels coming out of this thread it seems. My assumptions: People insecure that they might secretly be the dumb friend in their group. Just because you say it's an asshole thing to do, doesn't mean people don't intrinsically recognise when someone says something dumb, and have a feel for how often this occurs.
Your brain puts people in smart and less smart buckets whether you admit it or not. Someone vocalising that this is reality without directly ridiculing anyone by name doesn't make them an asshole. But I guess I'm an asshole for even making that statement so what do I know.

Mmm, was really hoping you'd actually give me a straight answer, but as usual it's a complete dodge.
Tried to search for smart or intelligence within the wiki, didn't get any charts showing the statistics you claimed existed. That's a shame. I was sure I would find some, seemed like a place where you'd find that sort of citation.
Here's the thing. You friends aren't all equally smart. No one is equally smart. Acknowledging this doesn't make you an asshole. Refusing friendship with someone for that reason would make you an asshole. The dude who originally made the claim, still considered his less smart friend to be his friend. Also, smugly linking people to dunning-kruger, or frankly, any wikipedia entry as though you're the only one aware of the topic is in itself, an asshole move. Surprise! The only reason I'm replying to you is because of this blaring irony.
Perhaps what you're failing to articulate is that it's hard for one human to judge the intelligence of another, which is true. However, if one is aware of a specific topic, and your friend is linking to blasé takes on a subject you're well versed in; then at least on that topic you can be fairly sure they're less educated, making them appear less intelligent.
There's nothing wrong with assuming you know more than your friends about a subject you're intensely interested in. There is something wrong with smugly linking people to wikipedia articles in the same way your dim friend might link you bad takes on bitcoin. You're basically the guy OP shows linking to a bitcoin article going UH-OH! Come to think of it, the insecurity makes sense now.

Yes, when I buy a sandwich I suffer an immediate loss of my money in exchange for a sandwich. That is a sunk cost. When you buy stocks you immediately lose your money in exchange for shares of a company at around the same value. The value of that stock changes, and what you're holding is no longer money but potential for money.
No one said anything about not buying anything. You can buy anything you want, but the value is transferred from one asset to another immediately. Money is gone, and all you have is potential. Like backing a Kickstarter that might never see the light of day or that might result in a product inferior to what you were expecting. Or you might get a huge discount on something great. It's all just potential after you hand over the money.
If you bought something that's dropped in value 90%, you paid for diamonds but all you got was coal. Maybe with enough time and pressure, you can still get a diamond eventually, but right now it's just coal. Don't get me wrong, coal can be useful - as long as you buy it at coal prices.

If your question wasn't worth asking I wouldn't have replied to you. I'm the one that gave you the most comprehensive answer and direct advice.


My Response:


The timeframe is either Feb or Apr for the buy. Having it since then means you bought it as an investment.
Then you said:


So you didn't buy anything with it, hence didn't use it as a currency. Confirming that you bought it as an investment.


So you bought it as an investment, and if you're considering selling it now, it's because you intended to make profit with it. You didn't want to buy stuff with it, you didn't invest in the technology or else selling wouldn't be on the radar. You wanted to buy it for profit.
Then you replied to me with this nonsense:


I don't know why you're making me spell this out for you. You clearly invested for profit. You missed that opportunity, at least in the near term. Sorry you're having a hard time accepting that.
I'll refer you back to my original advice


Let me re-phrase in case that's still opaque. If that remaining $80 is keeping you up at night, and cashing out would let you sleep easy, then sure do it. But at this point, you've lost most of that value already. It would be buying high selling low, which is the polar opposite of what you should do when investing. If it's not keeping you up at night, just pretend it's already lost, and don't pay much attention to it, and return at a later date. It might recover, but in all likelihood, it'll be 6 months+.
