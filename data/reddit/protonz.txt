I agreed with Peter's logic, but millions have been sent to these new retailers, and bitcoin is still going up today.
So it's a lot like his hyper-inflation argument. He thinks increasing the USD money supply via quantitative easing will lead to inflation, but somehow it isn't.
I have seen him admit being wrong before though, he predicted a market crash &amp; hyper-inflation, but didn't anticipate that people would take money out of the market and move it to USD (thus increasing the value of the dollar). I'm hoping a year from now he will say he was wrong about bitcoin and be able to explain why.

Looks like some people missed the meme reference, well timed friend :)

It appears to be so vaguely worded that it could mean anything. But I have no doubt they could do it if they wanted, even without this wording in the budget.
They already do it in the ways that are not obvious to many (inflation &amp; low interest rates). Doing it the obvious way is probably something they want to avoid too.
I look at it as a win-win for bitcoin. If they don't do it, fine. If they do, then it will push more people towards bitcoins.

Sounds similar to the [Prisoner's Dilemma](
I don't see how this is analogous to something in the bitcoin economy though. Do you see some parallel to exchanges or the stock markets (like Havelock Investments?)
There is also a difference between voluntary self-regulation due to market pressure, and some external governmental regulation.
The most interesting example I have seen of the former are the bitcoin casinos that are [Provably Fair](

That guy had a reddit bitcoin tab open.

I was hoping someone would mention this. I found the same information on this light bulb conspiracy theory a few years ago just due to natural curiosity (something didn't make sense about it).
I may be mistaken, but it seemed like more people in the bitcoin community sounded like you just a few months ago. Now I'm getting a conspiratorial or even anti-capitalist vibe from a lot of comments. Very odd.

I'm new to bitcoins (proudly bought 1.2 yesterday), but I've heard people complain about **blockchain spam**.
Apparently legitimate businesses like Satoshi Dice can use the bitcoin network in such a way that negatively impacts the blockchain. (I don't exactly understand how)
I've seen people appeal to Satoshi Dice to 'play nice'[[1]]( If this is true, then there is some kind of technical problem that requires begging to avoid the problem. Seems like a bad sign to me. Hopefully my gut is wrong on this one.
