I don't think it is likely to settle for quite a while. It emerged from a quiescent period and has become very volatile. If this were a stock where the fundamentals of the business were strongly positive, commentators would simply assign its recent behavior to profit taking.
It could drop to $500 or below, but I don't think it will settle. The halvenign will have an impact and raise the price. I doubt if the price will settle any time this year. (My expectation is that it will go beyond $1200 but I'm as ignorant as the next guy - truth is I don't know.)

Their latest claim - that they have 4 million users seems likely to be an exaggeration. If there are that many Bitcoin users, which I doubt, then I don't believe they all use Coinbase.

I too am trying to get my head around gbtc. I bought some. It helps because you take note of the price.
 
I didn't expect gbtc to tank today, but it dropped about 0.75% at the open. The bitcoin price fell overnight (to $720) which was slightly lower than its price on previous day market close. But by the time the market opened it was above the previous day's market close. Nevertheless gbtc lost value initially. 
Since market open today, gbtc has risen 8% (in 2.5 hours) while the Bitcoin price has been static (no increase at all).
The previous day gbtc was almost static while Bitcoin was rising. Bitcoin rose 4% (during market hours).
I deduce that gbtc does not follow Bitcoin price closely at all, but is driven entirely by investor supply/demand during the day. I'm guessing that the only price being set by the fund is the price on market open. I guess they do that to a formula buying or selling bitcoin daily to keep the stock price market cap in line with the bitcoin they hold.
Overall gbtc must roughly track Bitcoin price or the fund is a fraud. 
I'm just guessing most of this btw.

Actually is possible, even if very unlikely. 10,000 Brits kept quiet about Bletchley Park from 1940 to about 1970. They really did. The problem is believing that any government (US or otherwise) would think Bitcoin a good idea given that no government can ever control it.

There is going to be more of these kind of events. We have little idea how many companies there are like PayPal who try to own your data so they can profit from it. (Facebook, Visa, your bank, your ISP, you mobile phone carrier, etc.) The blockchain will eventually burst many balloons.
