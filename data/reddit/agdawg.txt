Majority of the people here can’t read a basic chart. Check out TradingView. It’s free and and offers more than you could ever want. 
Make an account, and you can then have a dashboard and add anything to your list. Just search for the crypto name.

Don't listen to the majority of people here. They are not traders, and can't even read basic charts. We will see 20-25k after the CMOE futures in the next few weeks. After that we will see should see a big dip. Buy some now, and I'd personally wait for the dip. 50/50 spread out. But don't just purchase randomly.

So many good tokens and ICOs to invest in. However I disagree with the BTC will dominate altcoins. 
Each of the altcoins have their own purpose. ETH as a platform, LTC for transaction. Digibyte, Vert, Monero, etc all have special purposes. 
BTC will be used as a store of value, not for transactions or currency.

Yes, back to my point one I agree. Exaggerated a little in my frustration. Basic idea still applies.
And to my second, yes there are a few scenarios, which at this point are minimal risk compared to the overall future. Do they exist? Yes, if anything was risk-free there wouldn't be any gains/potential.

If your purchasing with 2k, I reccomend GDAX. Coinbase has outrageous fees, it’s insane. Use their trading platform. It’s just as simple and has no fee’s for takers. 
Withdrawing is as easy as pasting your receive address. 
Also, usually my wires take 2 days at most. I’ve never waited 2 weeks, unless this is a security protocol for new users. The credit card limit can not be lifted immediately.

He would never trade in for fiat though. His vision was for Bitcoin to REPLACE fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:00:38
Safe as can be. They are an established U.S exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:18:41
I agree, in my frustration after countless threads I exaggerated. But, the basic idea applies.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:43:55
Use a spread sheet. If you have large holdings, that’s equivalent to posting it. Don’t share how much you own with anyone. You are tying an ID to your holdings by using Blockfolio. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:32:00
I reccomend not investing in random coins just because they are low. 
There are many good coins which will go through the roof. You need to understand how they work, and what their purpose is. Same for ICO’s
Keep in mind many of the best options are in ERC-20 tokens.

Bitcoin is making the headlines because of it's price, popularity, and proven viability. In addition to being the very first of it's kind, the innovator of the block chain. 
However, as more people flood into exchanges, GDAX/Coinbase for example, they will be more lenient to the lower prices of LTC &amp; ETH. We will see the similar growth percentages on LTC and ETH soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:23:31
The hype? We have yet to see the hype. Less, if not 1% have invested in BTC, and we have hit 20k. 
Decentralized and revolutionary. BTC will be a store of value, while the ETH provides a solid platforms for world-changing businesses in the block chain. LTC will be for transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:45:11
Coinbase is perfect for your grandma who wants to buy some BTC, but anyone with some computer skills should use GDAX, as there are no fees. (You have to place a limit order under 1 penny of the market). But yes, it's essentially the same.
The wire should take 1-3 days. Mine mostly clear the next day, and if not 2 days at most.
Also, I'd recommend purchasing the Ledger Nano S. Ultra secure and is only like $70 on Amazon. Hardware wallets are the best option out there. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Cheers man.
Happy HODLing :)

First, I'd have to disagree. If the US government bans bitcoin, I personally believe we will see a price increase. Yes, you heard that right. The public is already loosing trust in the fiat system. It's paper, and backed by what? The U.S Dollar can instantly be worth 0 tomorrow if China dumps the U.S Treasuries. How are they going to arrest everyone? Look at the numbers, it's impossible. Just like if everyone on the highway is going 85, and the speed limit is 65. They can't pull over everybody. This is also the beauty of anonymity and decentralized exchanges. This is exactly the reason crypto-currency is so great, is because I have authority of my money, not anybody else. A ban would drive the demand for crypto-currnency up. It would reveal the governments hand to the public that they are quickly loosing control. CHINA, Yes, the world's biggest nation tried to ban crypto. How did they work out? 
And to your second point. If you have knowledge of trading, then yes of course. I'm getting out at the top and in at the low in the next coming weeks. Would I recommend this to 99% of people on this sub-reddit who don't even know what a candle stick is? Heck. No. Easy and fast way to get burned by just "guessing" the top and low. If you can trade, then trade. If you have no knowledge, get in and hodl. 
 
Edit: This guy makes a good point about BTC and the financial institutions. Even more reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:29:37
Check out some altcoins man. BTC will see 100k by late spring. ETH &amp; LTC will be through the roof as well. 
This is JUST the beginning. We have less than 1% of the public invested. Wall Street has just entered the market. The public is next. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:23:46
Yes. We should see an explosion this week upward, with a dip soon. Hold your horses, patience is the key. 
Also, I personally wouldn’t ask for market advice here. Everyone here likes to think they know how to trade crypto just because they hold it. I see way to many people here buying at the top, and selling at the lows. Most people here can’t understand technicals and end up getting burned. I’m not saying everyone here is an idiot, but just take everything with a grain of salt and be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:39
I’d offer you some technical insight, but I’m on my phone right now. However, here’s a good article to get started. 
In addition, just imagine this. You are a mother, who knows nothing about crypto, but want to use it for transaction. You see LTC is at 1,000 and BTC is at 200k. Which one are you more likely to buy to use?
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:44:25
It’s not “insider trading”, but it’s wall st playing fucking games like always and screwing the public.
It’s simple really. The big boys on Wall St short BTC with 5x leverage, and issue a massive sell order (in this case a dump of 75M). It flushes the market out. So yeah, you took losses on selling BTC, but sense your leveraged 5x you made a ton of money. See? 
It’s manupulation of market, screwing everyone unless your an “insider” in the circle and get the battle plan. That’s why futures was actually horrible for BTC, it was a free market before then. 
ETFs are going to give them the opportunity to rape and pillage the public in the market. However, I do support the ETF approval because it will be heavily bullish.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:48:12
Coulda Shoulda Woulda man. If you invested 1k at 2$, you’d be banging your head you didn’t just go all in, even though you knew it was the future. 
We are still in the beginning stage, but we won’t have long. The countdown is ticking for a go for launch on this ship.
Personally, I reccomend people invest in altcoins at this point. Yes, BTC will be huge. 10x will be seen next year. however many of the alts have potential for 25, 50 or 100x next year alone. 
The crypto space is going to blow up. if you can understand a fraction of it, you know it will be the future and will change the world. 
Board the ship, and HODL on my life my friend. I assure you one day you won’t even want to sell it for dead fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:38:49
You can go short or long. Easy way to get burned though. Leave it to the Wall Street pros. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:20:06
Of course, I'm not saying be reckless. Everyone should approach financial decisions cautiously.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:30:29
He would never sell his bitcoins. He didn't create Bitcoin to get rich and then flip into fiat currency. He is the ultimate believer in block chain technology, and designed it to go against everything institutional. Bitcoins for purchases, maybe. But to sell? No way. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:17:41
I agree. I don't think we will see a crash at this point in the market.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:25:19
Cheers man.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:19:46
True believers won’t sell. Unless, you are getting out at the top before a predicted dip, and then back in. 
Those who are cashing out, not to trade but to go buy a house, car, etc. will regret it in a few months, and be in tears in a year. Just like those who sold at 200$ are forever regretting their decision. 
Bitcoin is the future, not fiat. One day fiat won’t be worth a dime. We have JUST entered early adopters. The public isn’t even in BTC yet and we topped at 20k. Just HODL my friends.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:25:23
Exaggerated a little in my frustration. I agree. However, I would say that the risk measured in short term profits is high. However, long term is minimal compared to the projected future of BTC. Still risk? Of course just like any market. Deviating into alt coins? Even higher risk.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:12:49
This. And then I see posts about futures &amp; margin trading when they don’t even know how to read a candle stick chart. A fast way to loose everything you own. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:37:37
For sure. CMOE will push BTC upwards of 20k+ with a big dip afterwards. Perfect time to get out, and then in.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:16:22
Totally agree man. Gambling is the same as betting. Investing is betting you will see a bullish market. Calculated risk at that.
In my frustration, I over exaggerated and made blanket statements. I was referring to those who made "moon or bust" type statements that irritated me.
Also, when I mentioned the "BTC" market, I was referring crypto currency, but using BTC as an example, since it's the so called "leader" of the crypto space. With that said, I was specifically talking about people who relate the crypto market with the housing market, etc. when they don't understand the fundamentals and it's not comparable to historical markets.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:49
This site is terrible! Everyone check out TradingView. It's far superior and has clean, smooth charts with any indictator avaible for those who actually use technical charts. Best charting tool for crypto. Free too.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:54:38
I’m not eliminating BTC for transactions, however that will not be its main purpose. The lightning network will be fantastic, but I still believe LTC will mainly be used due to numerous reasons. 
They will all see insane growth over the next year. I personally believe  BTC will mainly be a store of value while LTC is used for transactions, and ETH is a platform for block chain tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:12
Yeah, I’m not talking about investing though. I’m talking about those who try to actively trade bitcoin and then get burned on the first day.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:15:09
Traditional investing? No. 
Charts? Yes. All markets follow basic principles. However, each market is different and requires modification of technical analysis and/or new ways. 
I assure you a professional trader on wall street trading the S&amp;P 500, etc. knows his way around on a crypto chart. Will he nail it? No. Will he predict an optimal time to get in/get out within a margin of error? Yes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:39:42
Early majority will come. The financial institution is dying, and people are quickly loosing their trust in the government. 
Just like those who said the majority will never adopt the internet. It changed the world, just like the block chain will. You shall see my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:31:42
Yes sirr, GDAX is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:44:01
NO! There isn't any garuntee you will receive compensation if they loose your BTC. Trust no one!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:34:13
While originally intended as a currency, it is not. Litecoin, etc. and other block chains that utilize the lightning network for transaction will be used as currency.
Bitcoin however, is a decentralized store of value. Please, don't be bashing on something you are ignorant of.
