@_date: 2018-01-19 06:23:49
I am not gonna downvote you. BUUUT I should.  But I won't. 
The reason for BCH's creation, WAS TO STEAL BITCOIN'S name and attempt to profit as long as possible.  
Get the fuck outta here, there were many alts cheaper than BTC before BCH.  LTC fucking Doge.   
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:48:22
I've held a long time.
spent $65 in late 2011 "to check this bitcoin thing out."
Even when they were worth $4 and I had about 10 left, I encrypted wallet.dat and stored offline on multi CDs and thumb drives. 
I have watched it go from 4 to 20,000 and still haven't sold.
I believed but not enough to buy more, which sickens me now. 
*edit  oh and I have a REALLY great NewEgg monitor that's 4 years old and worth more than my 2 cars if I could get the coin back.

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:41:50
I thought if there was a 51% attack, the "trust in the blockchain" was corrupted.
Therefore an exchange, could step in and be all "We will replace your BTC with CBCoin!  If you had $10,000 worth of BTC before you now have $10,000 in CBCoin!  Just download this wallet and keep trading."

This would work, but it doesn't really answer your question about transferring funds to a Ledger.
I don't know exactly what app you are using, but look for a way to adjust the fee. If you can't and you don't hold your keys/seed you are kinda stuck.

Its just in its S curve right now. It will stop gaining so much eventually. Then the deflation will be perhaps the opposite of what we have of INflation today @ 2% a year.   So instead of saving $100 and every year having 2 less, you have 2 more.
2% more isn't enough to HODL, you still want to invest. Just you don't HAVE to invest as risky. Because your hard earned labor money isn't drying up like Barbera Bush's cooch.

Bro, based on everythign -I- have read and understood, that, it is a known thing that the miners are spamming, no one knows how much.
There were/are 2 camps, big blocks and non big blocks.  The big blocks are the miners, they want bigger blocks, means more money for them. The non big block camp want other things like side chains and segwit.   BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT MAKES THE BLOCKS BIGGER THREATENS THE DECENTRALIZATION OF THE BITCOIN.

There are layers to a protocol stack.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:54:38
Well somehow we have the same point, yet disagree. LOL!
Let's just say, crypto isn't new and IN MY OPINION, Bitcoin is one of the cleanest, simplest protocols out there. It is very simple; it's beautiful. Just some cryptography and networking really.
So it has solved the problem of decentralization and double spending. There are no "problems" with it for what it is supposed to be. All the newbs and 2 year "vets" that want to buy coffee, need to STFU.  We had that capability back when it was $5 a share and no one REALLY used it. So that isn't a problem. Schnorrwhateverthing and LN will fix this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:38:01
But when you recoup a large percentage (all?) of those fees because you are a miner, then you can go a lot longer.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:09:20
If the devs did that, they would need to get the majority on board with their new software. Everyone would need to install it or patch the existing.
So like if your bank sent you an email that said " we want your vote if its cool if we (basically take half your money thru inflation) print more money "  Most people wouldn't go along with it.

Just my understanding:
Let's say you invest 1 BITCOIN @ $15,000. They take that for the agreed period of time. Say three months after which you will get your investment back. All while collecting a small percentage, lets go with 10%.  So in three months, you will get $16,500 back.  Thing is. You don't get a "Bitcoin" back you get the value at the time you invested, so $15k. But during those three months, your bitcoin WAS worth (at one point) $19,000. In the end I guess it really is up to you if that seems like a good deal.

IDK. I mean technically you're correct. Starbucks isn't accepting BTC for coffee.
But as a customer, I can walk up send some sats to the address given to me, and walk away with my coffee.
I don't really care how Starbucks accepts it, whether they HODL it or spend it OR exchange it instantly for USD.
Point is, i just used BTC to buy a coffee at Starbucks.

I think you're coming from the right place but perhaps micro transactions would be better suited. 
Someone buys $1 worth of BTC and "spends it" a fraction of a penny at a time to view content. 
Ideally don't have to click too many times and you just kinda surf to a site and unless it's on a black list who cares that you just spent literally .0000001 CENTS

HEY gl00pp! HEY! You better sell those bitcoins of yours, the CEO of bitcoin just got arrested (referring to the guy who did some shadyness with the Silkroad guy's money that was in the paper).
Me: Uhh I don't think there is a CEO of bitcoin, it's decentralized.
Him: Well you better read up on your investment, says right here the CEO of bitcoin is arrested.
Why the HELL do news outlets have to have stupid titles like "BITCOIN CEO ARRESTED"
It's like yes he was a CEO of a bitcoin company but not the CEO OF BITFUCKNIGCOIN
*edit while I am ranting, anyone else not really like the whole Coin card thing for credit cards? Like it's called COIN, it misleads people into thinking that COIN and bitcoin are the same.

Yeah why should anyone be forced to "invest" their surplus value? I earned it, I want to HODL or SAVE but what was saved in 1950 is worth 1/50th today.  
Suppose instead of 2% inflation a year, there was 2% deflation?  Would that be so bad? 
Ohh ohh people will just hoard their money and NOTHING will ever get built or invested in.
BUUUULLLLSHIIIIIIIIITTTT   
People will always want MORE money, they will not be happy with 2%.
the net outcome being that if you DON"T want to invest in stocks, business etc you wouldn't have to.

No the Trezor, essentially forces you to create a offline SEED of 12-24 words (+1)
You don't carry around coins in the Trezor, it just contains keys, safely. Should you have a small amount for a hot wallet.
It has been shown that if the physical device is compromised after you set it up it can be hacked. 
If you can remember 12 words, you can keep your coin safe and access it at anytime.  
You don't NEED a trezor to create the 12 words safely (offline, clean PC etc) but it makes it easier for the smart normies. (such as myself)

Someone correct me if i am wrong but this is the best i've come up with:
The 24 word seed &amp; passphrase route:
Hardware wallet creates seed OFFLINE, uses passphrase as additional sec.
24 word seed.  Written down.  NEVER GOES ONLINE EVER. Can be in multiple trusted places. Stashed/hidden at Grandmas, at your work at home in your car.
Passphrase is EVERYTHING make it memorable and follow the longer is generally better than complicated. REMEMBER IT.
So you now have a seed that is worthless if someone finds it because ONLY you know the passphrase.  If your house burns down, a copy is at Mom's....

Bought  in Jan 2012 from mt gox.
AS SOON AS I HAD THE COINS I MOVED THEM TO A WALLET I CONTROLLED.   
THen I burned that wallet.dat to a CD and tossed it in a drawer.
once they hit like $700 each I moved to another more encrypted wallet (still burned to CD) Then I renamed a encrypted .rar to .jpg (attempt to be sneaky) and uploaded a 'pic' to gmail so I'd always have it.
Once it hit $3000 I got a Trezor, once it hit 6000 I got a 2nd Trezor.
Guess what I'll do when it hits 9, yup you guessed it another Trezor.

But if there wasn't mad gainz would you look at it that much differently?  Imagine it was the opposite of what we have now. So instead of inflation of say 1% a year we have deflation of 1%.  How does that improve my life earning 30k a year working at starbucks? I get 1% interest instead of deflation?

I'd mention that lets say you didn't admit for whatever reason that you sold some or bought some (are they asking if you bought or just sold? (im baked)).
And lets say that it does moon and you are flush with "cash".
Then they audit you and somehow find records (internet is for ever baybay) of you trading AND stating that you DIDNT 
Now you get to pay bigly fines.
So instead of "prostitutes" and shit...They are maybe trying to snare some idiots who don't pay their share. And who come up big.

@_date: 2019-04-21 02:25:51


Sure but it's not the tax itself its that in order to be 100% above board when buying $5 coffees, I have to go through insane amounts of book keeping hoops.
Such as is the coin you're spending been owned for 12 months or less?
    Technically if you had 2btc and one was 1 month old and the other 5 years old, you better be sure you're spending the one that's only 5 years old and reporting the cap gain.
It's just a ginormous hassle.
I am all for paying taxes, but the way it's setup with crypto right now makes it a nightmare to even deal with.
Consumption tax makes sense to me but what do I know.

ex HVAC guy here who grew up in England where radiant heat (via mainly water but also steam) is the norm. Now live in the US and everyone has these damn forced air furnaces. Which DO make the house temp fluctuate CONSTANTLY.
Radiant heat IS THE BEST HEAT.
The reason the US has so much forced air, is because after WWII there was a house building boom and its just far simpler (and alas, now cheaper) to install ductwork for forced air than to install a boiler and the necessary piping. 
Gitchoo som radiant!

I hate to piss on your campfire.
but the CONCLUSION to the article posted kinda says it all don't it.
It’s important to note that for the blockchain to work,  the node-to-node network must be motivated and agree to work under ethical standards. Once, and only if, these standards are adhered to, the blockchain could become a powerful tool for improving business, conducting fair trade, democratizing the global economy, and helping support more open and fair societies.
Ain't no miners mining a coin that don't pay.  Therefore its not really blockchain but a database.

You can't have blockchain without bitcoin.
If you want permission-less environment, you need a VALUABLE currency to pay those securing it.
Otherwise you have a fancy database.
Are you a shill or are you open minded?
Any business considering implementing a use case for blockchain needs to ask themselves: Do you need something that is open, neutral, borderless, that no one controls, and that resists censorship?
If the answer is no, then what you need is a regular old-fashion database. If the answer is yes, then what you need is Bitcoin or Ethereum or a similar cryptocurrency.

No one called it a scam. I think its just the translation making it sound wonky.
I take it as them saying that there is the possibility of making a mistake like he mentioned of an incorrect card number.
Then the BTC BUYER says "hey I sent the money where you wanted it" THEN the BUYER could get the BTC and then pursue getting his money back "oops sorry my mistake please send it back" they might get lucky and get both BTC and fiat returned.

Something like this.
People who are "learned economists" talk of inflation in the currency being needed to spur economic growth. 
They say "Why would you spend your USD if it's going to be worth more tomorrow? The reason we have 2% inflation is to encourage spending and growth."
I say, maybe we shouldn't all be living on credit cards. And perhaps having a 2% deflation would be enough to get people to consume only what they really need.
To add to that the US dollar has lost 50% of its value in the last 50 years.
Why should normal people HAVE to invest in the shitty stock markets in order to keep THE MONEY THEY EARNED? and not lose it to INFLATION.

Yeah I need a straight forward answer to this too.
Like I just see this giant loop happening. Where I have to cash out some crypto to pay the tax on the crypto I just cashed out....
I guess it could be as simple as just calculating the capital gains and then paying appropriately when paying with BTC.
This is a MASSIVE step in the right direction, but it needs to be easier. I'd say a system, that, when one spends, one has the option AT THAT MOMENT, to include "tax" and its allll digitally recorded and handled at the time of the tx.

Get a hardware wallet.
They basically exist so that:  You create a wallet **OFFLINE** This is important because there are a few ways to make a new wallet, but they involve using your computer that MAY (is) be infected. By using a hardware wallet (I rec. Trezor) you create the wallet with the Trezor and even if a hacker is watching your screen remotely they can't the seed words displayed on the Trezor.  That you then write down and **KEEP OFFLINE.**

It's really not THAT hard though. Just another step that you'd THINK wouldn't be.  But you just keep a ledger or spreadsheet of your purchaes then come tax time you do the math. You just have to accept at least in USA, that you will be paying minimum of 15% to the man on your gains.

It's better because you need a computer to generate the wallet. You could use some shady website that has multiple attack vectors. Or from your PC that could also be compromised.
What to do?
Sure you can use a hot boot version of Linux or wipe your PC. But that's complicated.
In comes hardware wallets.
They do the key creation offline.
It's it's own computer that isn't comprised.

People buy BTC on CB.

Well you are essentially risking your "credit" this imaginary thing that will help you get lower car and house payments. 
So what you are essentially betting on is this if you take a loan:
If BTC abjectly fails you are not getting any cheap car loans and will be forced to drive a $500 beater and rent a home for 7 years (the time it takes for your credit to clean up by being 'good' with your bills.) 
if BTC even remotely moons you pay back the loan and keep the extra
So youre betting that.  In my mind.
I wouldn't do it but I can see why some hippy who don't care about cars and houses that somehow has good credit doing it.

Then withdraw the cash?

@_date: 2018-12-27 00:57:54
Totally agree.
But I think you'd get audited if you were doing that often. Or if it was more than 100k or whatever. So there is a limit to how much one could wash that way..
And if you didn't have a way to prove the coins were from an early investment. You'd be screwed.

You still have to prove you bought it and there is wallet forensics.
Here is a scenario: You claim you bought 4 btc for $100 cash. Back when they were $25 each and you want to sell them at $10k each for total of $40k on Coinbase.
To sell on CB you need to be verified.
They could come to you, Mr. FourtyKay, and say HEY, show me where that $40k came from!
If you were to say "Hur dur I bought 4btc for $100 from a guy on the street 5 years ago"
They would say "OK we see the wallet address that sent the coin to CB and we can see that the wallets that sent the 4 btc to it were moved to that address only a few months ago."
End of your $100 holding story right there.
 You would have to show them on the blockchain where they were purchased.

I mean, newegg and overstock both did somethign like saved 25% of the crypto they took (way back when it was $300/btc) and ARE SUPER FUCKING GLAD THEY DID.

you know there are 21 million 'coins' divisible to .00000001 
I am not a maths guy but, well, you figure out what .000001 times 21 million is...to see the real cap.

And you KNOW that companies like Amazon can absolutely decide to just accept it and also collect on the fees that Moon is probably getting. From the video of OP it was hard to see but I think they got 2 cents. from that transaction.

I keep reading about this 'water density test'
If I have a soccer ball and a gold ball the size of a soccer ball.  if I hold the soccer ball underwater in a bathtub it will displace X amount of water.  If I put the golden soccer ball in the tub the same X amount of water will be displaced.

Unless *they* started bitcoin in the first place. Seems like a good way to get drug dealers to pay their taxes. "Oh you did some bitcoin mining way back when they were worth. .02 cents each huh and you want to exchange for USD. Pay me"  (or as Pesci said "Fuck you pay me!")
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:14:41
It could be an script that is initiated by the servers being yanked and no admin to turn off the panic button.  Sort of a deadmans switch if you will. So DPR may have made it.  
ALSO he posted his email LONG LONG AGO BEFORE SR was even a thing. He didn't realize how big and popular it would get. It's not like he KNEW he was gonna be CEO of some 8billion$ worth of transactions BEFORE THE SOFTWARE WAS WRITTEN

I will lose karma for agreeing with you but you are right. It is absurd to know that bartenders make $500-$1000+ per shift in tips. It's total bullshit. I have been told that if I can't tip then I should not go out. It's just people defending their income potential. But it is still bull shit I bust my ass at work and make far less than bartenders poppin' caps and pouring drinks.  They perpetuate this tipping fiasco. Like some guy just opened a beer bottle and "that'll be $5 for the beer and 1 for me" is highway robbery.  The sooner we move away from tipping and be more like Europe the better.  TAKE MY KARMA YOU UNGRATEFUL SERVICE INDUSTRY CLOWNS.
