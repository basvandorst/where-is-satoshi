No fees in the UK apparently and certainly not in France. Probably the same in the whole UE.

Ahah, that's cute. [FYI](
Living in France you might only be aware of a very small fraction of what BNP does as a financial group.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:08:55
You really don't *know* that. They were one of the few to leave relatively unscathed after the 2008-9 debacle. Anyway... just wanted to put it out there that BNP Paribas is a major player.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:24:00
Yup. Sadly it doesn't go into much detail regarding which method to use (it's really more of a list)
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:32:31
The way I see it, mining "corporations" rely heavily on the BTC price and it's increase, too.
Anyway if I were you, I'd rather have control over my investment, ie buying BTC directly. I recommend Bitstamp ($) or Bitcoin-24 (€).

I bought Bitcoins on Bitstamp yesterday.
The best way to deposit is by SEPA (fastest, cheapest), they will convert it to USD when they receive it. 
Personally I just had to go on my bank's website, log into my account, fill in the form and hit Send. SEPA is pretty straight-forward.
You should "only invest what you can afford to lose", but keep in mind you can always withdraw and get your money in 2-3 business days.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:40:28
Well, yeah, it's gonna take a few days. You're in luck though because for me the banks were closed during Easter Holidays (friday to monday) and that was hell :p
SEPA deposits usually take 2-3 days. Most banks send in the morning and receive in the afternoon, so your SEPA will probably actually be sent only tomorrow if you were to do it today. But that's your best shot, there is no quicker way that I'm aware of. My balance was updated in 3 business days.
Their Support responds quite quickly btw so you can ask them to check their logs to see where your money is atm
edit: btw you don't have to buy a whole number of BTC, like 2 or 10 :p it's divisible. So send the money you want to invest regardless of the current price. The trend is what's important anyway !

I personally believe that many if not most of these "very-early" adopters sold their BTC (maybe not all of them) during previous spikes (5$, 10$...).
The pizza story illustrates this : almost nobody could predict the rise in value. Just like someone spent 25kBTC on a pizza, someone probably sold 25kBTC 
Besides, how would this tiny minority "control" Bitcoin ? At most they would be filthy rich... much like some people today, with fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:36:15
Technically, Bitcoins are divisible down to the satoshi, and the code can be modified, if need be, to make them even more divisible.
So while there will be "less Bitcoins", there will always be enough for everyone. And the Bitcoins you own will not lose value, unlike when central banks issue ("print") currency.
That's the beauty of a digital currency vs. gold or silver for instance

Also 
Biggest USD exchange in Europe.
And 
Biggest EUR exchange in Europe.
Both have much more volume than bitcoin.de (  )
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:10:45
There's 
I could not give you any feedback on them though
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:13
Well, what do you know, this article is actually interesting 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:45:50
Stop it with MtGox ffs
Use Bitstamp or BTC-e, or any other exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:03:24
Helps a lot, thank you ! It's very clear.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:27:21
At least 10 minutes, in most cases.
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:46:05
Thank you. I did not know about bitstamp, even though it seems to be the second market behing MtGox in volume.
This looks really promising !
If I can bother you a little more : why did you choose to trade in USD instead of EUR ? How does Bitstamp compare to bitcoin-24 (if you have experience with them) ? Again, thanks a lot.
edit: for anyone interested, nice article on bitstamp : 
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:36:02
I use [Biticker]( which also has a few more features.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:05:27
Yes, that's called arbitrage.
We would see it if MtGox wasn't such a fuckup
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:47:30
Bet you 10BTC it's not ! ;)
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:23:32
**Bitstamp**, definitely.
Bitcoin-24 is having issues : [their account was closed by the Polish gov](
[they can't program their trade engine themselves](
Bitcoin-central : works ok, declared as a bank in France (so, legitimate business), however, very little volume and shitty UI 
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:51:18
I live in France, but thanks for responding. This info could always prove useful to someone.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:53:27
Merci pour ta réponse.
J'aimerais bien t'aider mais malheureusement je manque aussi de temps :( je pense que c'est une bonne idée en tous les cas
Je vais essayer Bitcoin-24 dans un premier temps (légèrement plus d'échanges et aucun "trading fee") mais j'essayerai sans doute Bitstamp aussi
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:44:41
Thanks for these !
I'll probably use them tomorrow to quickly explain Bitcoin to a friend/potential associate.
I feel like everyone here should do that : spread the word. Coworkers, friends, family...

Yes, the troika asked the Cyprus gov to "tax" its citizens savings.
Yes, &lt;100k deposits are supposedly guaranteed by the EU (actually, only in the case of the bank itself failing)
However, the state of debt in Cyprus (~18bn, much more than their *entire* GDP) is absolutely their government's fault. They tried to specialize in activities that are... more or less legal, and failed.
Shouldn't they raise taxes the regular way, then ? Well they would, but tax evasion and fraud is so incredibly widespread there that it would be *useless*. Again, Cyprus gov's fault for being lax on purpose to appeal to investers.
What should the EU do then ? Bail them out completely ? No. They can help, but bailing out Cyprus for more than their *entire* GDP would create a dangerous precedent for the EU.
Besides, it has actually been decided on Monday that &lt;100k savings would **NOT** be hurt. They will be exempt from the tax.
Cypriots should really turn against their own, corrupt government instead of blaming the EU for following policies.
(just my 2 cents, thanks for reading)
