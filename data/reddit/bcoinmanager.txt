If you think that you've missed the bitcoin rocket, think what is right now worth pennies and will go worth thousands in future. The crypto-game isn't over yet.

A guy who defends "the real bitcoin" to the blood and spirit bought some at ath 2400$ and now he's waiting for the miracle to happen again. Before that he gave not very many fucks about "korean btrash", which was the very specific title he used for the coin. Investing is not for the faint hearted.

Btw, there is already a sort of fedcoin: tether. In my understanding it is created by the need of x amount and "backed" with dollars. Fedcoin would not be backed with anything but state force, of course, but point being, it would be a political-financial instrument, not a measure of value.

I personally think that a lot larger block sizes can be very sustainable because computer tech evolves constantly. I just purchased 500gb m.2 SSD and two 8TB externals because I routinely edit and render 4k video footage as my hobby and the file sizes tend to be tens to hundreds of gigs each.
My opinion is that it is enough that a node can be ran at computer platform that sits in the middle to higher end consumer price range, standing at 1-2k$, and the hardware this money can buy will constantly evolve better. Not everyone needs to run a node, especially not on phone or wristwatch. Even a very small server company can easily deal (hundreds of) terabytes of data all day every day.

As an investor having a billion dollar score one would sacrifice one crypto scene anytime. Humans are greedy, but their creations are also usually susceptible to misuse until something happens and then it's fixed when the damages exceed the benefits.
I'd worry when btc falls and bch rises, because investors follow money and they will buy bch to pump and dump, and when enough fools follow that trick, it could go too far and cause bch turnover.
But when all coins fall side by side, it's a good sign in that perspective it's legit move to fix speculative bubbles. We are now in the fix phase after the bch scramble.

As long as the newcomers hold their funds in xc they will not encounter any tx fees. The cold world hits their face only when they buy their first ledger and see that merely transferring funds to fill that device costs 1/4 of the price.

So what we are talking about here is 12 500 btc?

So with that kind of crypto they could at first have absolute control of everyone's finance, including negative interest rates which would eat up any funds. For the ordinary citizens it appears to be the case: either you pay interest for keeping the money, and the inflation eats the value at the same time. Please give me one single reason why I should emigrate to such system. I would avoid it like plague.

Cryptos can make firstcomers wealthy, but if they would replace ordinary monetary system, they could actually escalate inequality since hiding assets and evasion would become trivial and tax collection would become more difficult.

I sent an email to the group telling them to setup whatever fundraiser for this thing in order to make it work asap. The tx fees and delays are just unbearable an render btc obsolete for any practical purpose. If the general public is directed too much towards BCH the btc will find itself right next to ETH classic.

I see. I live in a nordic country and 4G 100/100 wireless cell subcriptions are staple connection here and I have fiber at my house that offers 1-10gbps at very reasonable price which I haven't activated though because I need mobile so much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:40:45
It appears to me that BCH has been mostly the Roger's Register for quick cash. Just hype it up, wait till stars align (retarget, take xc or two in and wait for some miner news) and start the Big Cash Pump. The noobs will buy your trash up to 9k till it crashes in a big dump.

I'm not a qualified programmer nor do I understand the details, I'm just merely pointing the issue because I've got several hundred thousand dollars at stake. Prioritizing transactions based on fee would cause low cost txns to be jammed for a long time if not even forever if the capacity is stressed constantly, but this would render it economically unviable. I don't know if there is limit to mempool, if it's size was big enough there could literally be tens of millions of txns waiting for confirmation and if most of them are 1sat spam it would not matter.
At the moment the mempool appears to have a very diverse and legit structure of payments. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:04:26
So, what's the next stop? 30k?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:53:43
Bittrex just have lowered the withdraw limit to 0.4btc per d for unenhanced users. Most sums concerned here are very, very small, like hundreds of couple of thousand dollars.
How can you trade hundreds of thousands worth of btc which is normal for some of us if you have to constantly fear of freezing funds? When the value changes, money must move swiftly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:47:04
Just transfered my btc from bittrex to ledger, took 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:16:26
So for each two coins you miss three. I call that waste.

I do not like to take sides and support fair game and last time BTC and BCH went havoc in nov 13 I turned my credits to their side, but as I did my background work I saw the big picture: the whole coin appears to be a tool of market troll that will try to get the number one position by all means necessary, primarily by trying to evaporate BTC assets. Those surges are not just people suddenly going for BCH but they are apparently initiated by someone, and of course the market follows. Yesterday was everything but normal market reaction.
There are significant downfalls at btc architechture, which are enormous txn costs and times and huge amount of energy used for mining and confirming txns and these must be fixed if the coin is expected to have future. I'm seriously considering pulling my investments off btc or bch into alts until the mess is cleared up. The jerks of old btc will hold down to zero if necessary for ideological reasons, and the bch people will apparently do whatever is necessary to tilt the balance and since it's business as usual for the bch people, people are in risk of losing most of their investments' value.

It appears to me that if exchanges were not there, btc would already be way clogged because of all the txns. I suspect that more than 90% of txns occur on internal ledger of xn and tradesites.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:06:38
The btc is unfortunately crippled even as digital gold if the tx costs are this high or even worse. I do honestly hope this issue is fixed asap and I'm willing to contribute as I have no expertise in programming.

First of all I'm not a bch fanboy, I hate the scheme, but obviously the chain is clogged atm and like I cited in other topic I suspect that more than 90% of txns occur inside exchanges and tradeplaces at internal ledger that funds them in bc only when they exit the place.

In most European and developed Asian countries internet speeds of 50-100mbps are widely available for low cost. I pay 25$ a month for my 4G cell phone subscription which has 100/100mbps unlimited. 1GB block would thousand-fold the current situation, but even it could be handled with this setup, and something that is 10-fold would be trivial.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:17
Not quite impossible. People consume enormous amounts of data nowadays by watching streaming services like Netflix and Youtube. 100mb/min is not out of question, especially when we look at the future scale of datarate. It's not that many years back when 1mbps internet was common.
It's not imperative that node is available to every single cheap ass. It's enough that it's available to anyone willing to invest at least a little bit. Anyone savvy enough to deal with such things is usually some sort of nerd already and deals with higher than average computer stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:31:22
It would be trivial to increase the block size even to 1 exabytes if it will be always filled with spam. Technically any system would be rendered useless with overload. Hence other measures should be taken within, but even the legit transactions clogging the system is an issue that must be urgently dealt with.

My account just got verified under 24 hours. I'm from a northern european country. I just thought that for some people the verification process can take much longer because they do not have easily accessible national databases and the verification has to be done manually through several different methods.
I also must note I did $50k trading on btc-bch as basic verified user without issues.

If someone mentions something new to me, I ask questions and attempt to find out from multiple sources whether it is legit thing and also listen to how people try to market it - the more they have to brag it the more likely it's something too good to be true.

Fee increase is a killer. Imagine having to pay 50$ for every exchange transaction. It would render anything less than 40k$ trades in-out unfeasible. For being a fiable trade medium the fees should be minimal, ideally free, and same goes with txn speed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:29:00
40k doesn't sound crazy at all to me. It's only twice the current ATH and as we saw it could be reached in VERY short time if big rocks move. 100k would make me wow. :D
