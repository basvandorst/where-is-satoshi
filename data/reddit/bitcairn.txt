Or better yet, remember this:  
Bitcoin has more value than just the ability to make a quick buck speculating.

Who said I wanted to stop anyone from doing anything?  I'm just lamenting the fact that human nature has fucked up what could have been something great.  Do you disagree that speculation has increased the price volatility?  Or that price volatility limits the appeal to the ordinary person?

So it's like Reddit, except not free?

The price bouncing all over the place makes most people hesitant to use it.  The speculators are ruining something that should have been a net positive for the whole world.
Imagine I invented a teleporter that let people ship goods or themselves anywhere in the world instantly, but then Donald Trump bought all the land around each portal and charged people a thousand dollars to access it.  He would be ruining something that could change the world in order to make himself rich.

Bitcoin's utility is the same whether the price is $500 or five cents.  It's only the greedy speculators who care about the BTC to USD exchange rate.

The novelty of Bitcoin is its ability to move coins anywhere in the world without a central authority.  A stable price is far more important than a high price.  This doesn't happen when you get a bunch of greedy idiots hoping to get rich doing a pump and dump.  They don't actually care about the technology, they just want to make a quick buck.  Now they're all losing their shirts, but their actions have killed confidence in what could have been an amazing opportunity for people everywhere.
