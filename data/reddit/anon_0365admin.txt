I have been doing it without issue. Cash app to my Trezor.   Cash app makes you verify with a picture of your ID before you can do that though

Interesting, this makes sense. So I bank transfer directly into CoinBase Pro? Buy crypto then sending it to my own wallet is associated with a fee + the network fee?

Of course

I was running into this issue with my LG G7 ThinQ. I discovered that the app would use the wide angle lens instead of the normal one. Causing the close up of the scanning in cash app to be a real pain. 
I got it to work eventually, was a real pain though.
Go to your camera app and make sure you have the lens selected that you would want to use in the app. See if that helps

Second! CashApp is perfect for buying and hodling.

I don't really have a lot of time to do that in front of a computer. Looks like fun. I did look at it briefly, still fees associated with it though...

Did you not read the title of the post? And as far as BCH, people can do what they want with their own money. That being said I've converted 75% of them to BTC ;)

I don't understand the aggressive tone, of course I don't expect anyone to do anything for free. But the fees are very disproportionate to what I was spending. I simply found better services with cheaper costs. 
At the end of the day Cash App and Abra get money from the increase in market value when purchasing crypto, coinbase does that on top of the additional fees.

This is what I do, simple enough
