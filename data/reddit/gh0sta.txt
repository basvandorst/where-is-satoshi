Only withdraw if you are desperate of the situation, otherwise HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:12:38

Brilliant! Thank you guys 
What's the difference between a mobile app and a paperwallet? Aren't they the same when it comes to keep your balance?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:35:00
Bitwallet is so underrated! Not sure why.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:34:02
Care to share the whole story? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:01:11
I would still go for opendime as an idiot proof and more secure option! However this does look good

FTSE can’t beat bitcoin so here they are shoving their narrative in everyone’s mouth
@_date: 2016-09-29 21:24:42
but transferring the balance doesn't need confirmations? just worried if this happens whilst transferring to another wallet?
@_date: 2016-09-30 13:19:05
Just wanted to update! No Loss :) all went through as it should be :D

I love to see disbelievers running like a headless chicken! Mind you I have seen this now for at least 4 time. Once we hit 30k they are the ones who will say again it's a bubble. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 21:18:40

Sounds like BCASH puppets trying to hack this reddit but with no avail
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:15:15
Adoption will mature the price and volatility won't be a thing. However, we won't see mass adoption unless institutions who controls everything aren't shouting about it
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:51:30
Correct! you can use your Coinbase Bitcoin wallet address to withdraw from gambling site and then convert that into cash and withdraw to your linked bank
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:13:25
No idea! better to read the TOC!
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:04:26

Shut up and enjoy the upward ride 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:27:45
