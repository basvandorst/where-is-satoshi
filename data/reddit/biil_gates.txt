Yes, we've made digital representations of the poop and its value via secured spreadsheets. We've even made a way for it to check itself and each transactions. We called it "mining" and "block-chains". By the end of its lifespan, no poop would be produced and thus no more "mining" but we've come up with a wonderful solution - fees to give incentive to "mining". It's basically Second Life Linden Dollars but with fees.

No, money is regulated by the government - not backed. You could also exchange dollars to gold or silver or anything in the vaults of the central bank. However, you could also exchange money to gold, silver, or anything outside the vaults of the central bank be it in supermarkets, department stores, or anything really. Also, dollar is legal tender - it is the only legal form that you could pay your workers. Any other form and you could be sued in court and have to repay them in cash (additionally from the Bitcoins you have already parted with). Taxes are also only in dollars. 
Zimbabwe is different from US dollar. US dollar is accepted in the whole world and the reserve of almost all central banks. Meaning the world is your supermarket, and you could exchange it with any item of value worldwide - not just in central banks. Zimbabwe dollar is only accepted in Zimbabwe. When the exchange value in that local market runs out, it is not accepted elsewhere.

You are comparing third world countries' economy to the first world USA whose dollar is the reserve of the world? You do know Zimbabwe have changed to US dollar as their currency of default.
And how are Bitcoins any different from your scenario? It could be exchanged to dollars *now* but soon it'll become like Second Life's Linden Dollars but with fees.

LOL the dollar is backed by assets as you could purchase almost everything in the face of the Earth. Not just gold, silver, or pearls - you have the whole world as your supermarket. Bitcoins on the other hand, is backed by nothing. It is just 1s and 0s.

No need, I own lots of Dogo Poop and a happy man! I just wonder when the hype dies down like what happened to Second Life Linden Dollars, would my savings and house be still there. But that is not my concern for today. I feel very rich!

Please don't call it dogo poop. Call it Bitcoin. And yes, each poop is checked thru "block-chain" technology thru a process called "mining". Hundreds of computer processing power is used to verify the chains and dogo poop.


Like Bitcoins, Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, Monero and a hundred more to shit the exact same stuff.


Again, please don't call it dogo poop, people call it Bitcoin.

No, when you feed it, you get a portion of the poop that was created. It is like everyone becomes the central bank or federal reserve that they hate so much and could print as much as they like (which many detest) as long as there is enough "mining" processing power.

Don't call it dogo poop, call it Bitcoins. It is rare even though there are thousands of similar virtual currencies out there based on the same model. Once dogo goes to heaven, the supply stops. Thus proving its rarity. It's so easy to check if it is fake or not, we have something called "block-chains" and "mining" where dedicated computers compute to verify its genuineness.

Thank you, I'm really happy that someone is paying $4,456.36 for dogo poop.

Care to point out the holes? Others find it funny though.
