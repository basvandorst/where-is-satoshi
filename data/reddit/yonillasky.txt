At least one of the exchanges needs to support it. In other asset classes, Market makers have all kinds of privileges (and obligations). 
At minimum, there's the fees involved. You can't seriously expect someone to make markets profitably over say Gox with the default fees, at the highest volume bracket it takes 0.25% each way at minimum. 
In the ECN's of equity markets, whenever they match a new order against a standing order, they actually charge the new order a small fee per share and credit like 98% of the fee to the owner of the standing order - that's a great way to improve liquidity. Until one of the exchanges implements a system like this, good luck.

Watch out, we have an internet badass over here.
He invented Market Making. Before he made his OP, no one in the BTC ecosystem ever considered trading the spreads or volatility for profit. True story.

This is what makes markets tick. Arbitrary analysis by lots of participants.
I mean, it's not like you could actually project anything of real importance to the fundamental value for BTC even to within an order of magnitude with any certainty. So far almost everything I've read w.r.t BTC price short or medium term has been similarly unfounded.

does one pay taxes on profit incurred by exchanging between two fiat currencies? I thought this was specifically exempted. 
Bitcoin/fiat trade would have to be taxed for capital gains if Bitcoin is seen as a security though.

I don't begrudge any of these guys individually, the problem is that if the bitcoin plan works they will be collectively claiming trillions, not billions, in material wealth. I've looked extensively into the numbers involved, and it's entirely possible that more wealth will be claimed by the buy-and-hold guys than the total value the cryptocurrency ever gives the world in the form of lower transaction costs. This is not the situation with Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc: the money the founders/shareholders were paid is indeed a small part of the wealth they brought to the world. I argue that's not the case with Bitcoin.

Of course, if 99% of the speculation here was wrong, all you had to do is just trade against it every time and you would become rich. The real fact of the matter is that it basically has no forecasting power. Whether it's right or wrong is pure coincidence.

Anyone could "be a believer" in BTC early, you mean anyone who has heard about it.
I don't know the census of people with nonzero BTC before start of year 2013, block chain could tell you how many addresses there were but not people - those guys have 50% of all BTC wealth that will ever be created. 
Let's say there's a few hundred thousands of them. I'm being generous here. So, you think the fiat money distribution is unfair? In BTC world, the 0.01% wealthiest control 50% of the wealth.
Ripple IS even less fair than that, but at least a greater portion of the world's population knows about crypto currencies now and can choose to get into it if they wish. That simply wasn't the case for BTC.

The volume charts are denominated in BTC. When BTC's lose value against other things, the same volume of actual trade (I mean goods and services for BTC) will now necessitate people to move a greater amount of BTC's.
Big price movements also cause people to move BTC's in and out of exchanges. Long term investors moving it to cold storage, miners and weak hands moving their stash to the exchange and cashing out, etc.

they created what wealth? 
Their contributions:
- Stress tested an experimental cryptocurrency. Not all of them did, but this isn't important.
- The protocol itself is public domain.
- They burned electricity, some of them paid for it and some of them (botnet operators) stole it.
- The protocol itself produces the coins. Even if there was only one node working on the hashing function at 1% cpu it would "produce" those coins just the same. They are not producing the coins and especially not the wealth they represent, their work goes into securing the network.
how is securing an experimental cryptocurrency in years 2010-2011 with barely any activity worth a claim to a few trillion USD worth of goods and services in year 2030? That sounds reasonable to you? and I'm the "extremely evil" one? Good grief.

you're assuming here that had bitcoin not existed, no other cryptocurrency would come about, and thereby Visa/MC/etc could continue to charge the rates they do today.
but at least you bothered writing reasonable answer this time, thanks.

we agree that market making will help BTC, but you asked the community to do something, while in practice, the way I see it, there are only a few players big enough to do something about it, and it's ultimately up to the people running the big 3 (or so) exchanges to actually make such an operation viable.

only "bad" news item I could find is that uptrend in download rates of the client was broken all over the world last month, except in China. The market consensus may have been over optimistic about that a week ago, so now there's a correction.
well that and the Mt.Gox situation, it's pretty clear now that BTC exchanges will all require people to hand them Govt issued ID's now. That turned some of the demand away. This is also from ~1 week ago.
Also there is never evidence of anything in fields like economics or sociology. You can't run scientific experiments, because there is no way to test against your null-hypothesis - you can only look at the real world which includes everything besides the phenomena you wish to isolate. So you just gather some stats and make some claims based on what you think the explanation is. You will not prove the root cause of effect X was Y only theorize about it and show the statistics seem to support that.

so in a hypothetical situation where the market cap for BTC was equal to the market value of all resources on the planet including real estate, you would be perfectly fine with this one guy, that at least on paper, has control of 25% or 35% of the world's resources? by rights of his father running some program on his PC 40 years earlier? 
you must be out of your mind.

What does it assume? 
Holding something (a private key in this case) for 40 years is honestly not very hard.
The question if it's acceptable that the odd bunch of crypto nerds, drug dealers, hackers, botnet operators, and the guy who first came up with the idea of mining on a GPU deserve a claim on so many trillion USD in goods and services from the rest of society. 
The bitcoin protocol is a wonderful invention but it's public domain and its usefulness is independent from the current iteration of the BTC ledger. You could see this ledger as a stress test proving the protocol/software is robust in real-world conditions. No doubt a great contribution, I fail to see why society at large is expected to give the participants more wealth than the tzars, emperors, and robber barons and the "evil bankers" ever could get their hands on in all those hundreds of years.

why should we expect it to behave any differently than, say, equity markets? bitcoins are priced for their current and future usefulness. News can change that, or public perception of it, and move the price. Care to argue otherwise?

BTC are on a long term uptrend that should have them at around $40- $50 right now, meaning it should hit $30s before we ought to consider them "for sale". They should have never gone past $40s. They did cuz hype, and now it's correcting. 
Disclosure: I got caught in the hype but thankfully was relatively lucky with the timing and my average is about $75/BTC. Could have been a lot worse. Just giving my honest opinion.
~~Stay~~Keep calm and carry on.
