Thanks.  Like I said, I'm all for avoiding address reuse, but I'm also keeping an open mind.
 
Noted on the android PRNG issue. Your point is valid. Having said that, I feel that a weak RNG or ECDSA implementation would fundamentally be a bigger issue than address re-use. 
 
I've also taken the time to go through your links, one of which actually did not support your case, while the rest simply rehashed the same point. And only one is applicable in this context.
 
Perhaps stealth address implementation is a chicken and egg situation, but you haven't mentioned how potential donors would use stealth addresses to donate to ASF today. And if I understand it, stealth addresses would not meet the transparency desire.

 was a pretty valueless post.

Not sure how to interpret that page.  How do we tell between work on 'the protocol', and work on some other portion of bitcoin?

Perhaps, as [Windows moves to a subscription model]( this is just a matter of time.

Alright, I'm all for not reusing addresses, but I really don't understand the argument here.


Ok, so this is not a problem in this particular context of Apache donations.


If I recall the Android PRNG bug correctly, when the PRNG was not properly initialized, the generated private keys were predictable. This would have affected all wallets and all addresses (even if not reused) which generated keys based on the weak PRNG. It was also said thataddresses generated using the weak PRNG would have a certain observable pattern, and that the attacks occurred by scanning the blockchain for transactions with addresses having that pattern. If this is correct, I'm not sure whether having unique addresses or address re-use would necessarily have helped. 
Were there other security implications of address re-use?


Is this a problem?


Sure, this works.  But it's rather inelegant if there were no problem that should prohibit the use of a single address in the first place.


ELI5 - what is this, and how would donors use this?

Except, that the interior angles of a square sum to 360 degrees?

Don't understand this. You can consume more than one IP address at a time (eg. multihomed host). And, more than one person can consume the same IP address at a time (eg. anycast, attacks).

Why must sign-ups be done via FB, Linkedin, G+?

At first, I thought your comment was absolutely right.
Then I realised that if they had been doing all their transactions with bitcoin, their customers would not be inconvenienced or lose a thing. The cost would be borne by UPS itself. That would incentivise them to make it secure.
