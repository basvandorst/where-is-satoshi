Don't use PHP for the server side of your operation (though you will need a client side element in PHP to plug into Magento etc).
Look at Cryptorush - they can't even get their floating point calcs right because of PHP's poor handling of floating point, among other weaknesses. Go for C++.

I don't believe this to be something which would spook people. Instead, I think it's important to let people know that **every** device needs to be updated. Providing a reason why you should update your devices is important, since the main excuse people give for not updating it is usually in the lines of: "Why would I update my set-top box? it works just fine!" or "Why would someone hack my set-top box?"
Additionally, having more closed doors is less incentive for black hats to exploit computers to mine crypto.

I see lots of people here are waaay too optimistic regarding the future of the planet.
There are two possible "crash" scenarios, IMHO. Economic collapse and environmental collapse. One is actually 
way worse than the other.
1) Crypto currencies thrives, even in the case of an economic collapse (for example, end of the petrodollar: the world starts pricing oil in a currency other than the USD). In this scenario we will be just fine.
2) Environmental collapse creates chaos, eletric grid collapses, and the apocalyptic mad-max scenario becomes a reality. In this case, you can bet bitcoins will be worthless. The only thing worth something will be water, land, seeds and bullets.

The Blockchain.info wallet seems to be safer than others against this type of attack, since the application data is only decrypted to RAM after you enter your passcode (although which, being only 4 digits, can easily be cracked). This passcode is required everytime you bring the app to the foreground.
Other wallets, for example Coinbase, keep the app open and do not require a passcode when you bring it to the foreground (the default setting is to not require a passcode at all). Since the app remains running in the background until closed by the OS or manually killed (for example, by a 3rd party memory mgmt app), your information remains decrypted, at least in RAM.
In other words: do not leave anything significant in a wallet which can be accessed from your phone.

There are two problems with what you said:
1) You are failing to realize Coinbase isn't a pure exchange. They also provide merchant services (like BitPay). If you had picked CampBX or Bitstamp for your example then you'd have actually made the point you are trying to make.
2) The point you were trying to make fails to take in consideration that bitcoin's future depends a lot on its ability to be used as a currency. If people in China can't use it as a currency, the chance this ability will become a reality is smaller.

I don't trust Gliph with full API access to my Coinbase and Blockchain wallets, and that's what is required to send/receive bitcoin thru Gliph.
