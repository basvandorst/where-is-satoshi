Spent much of today moving bitcoin around on non-segwit paper wallets to exchanges and to ios app wallets.

The intended purpose is in direct competition with PayPal, visa and bank transfers. And those techs work just fine. It’s much too red of an ocean to hit head on in competition.

Yes, this is not how it works. You don't get ownership of the blockchain just because you have 51%. The other 49% must still agree that the blocks you are adding are valid. If you stole unclaimed(?) coins the others would go 'wtf??' and refuse to accept your blocks as the true tops of the chain. All 51% gets you is higher likelihood that you can add multiple blocks at the top of the chain, causing the others to not have the chance to issue corrections (for a few blocks, perhaps as many as 6 at max, but more realistically 2-3). There is really nothing specifically interesting about the number of 51% either.

Something like that. When you buy something with gold or bitcoin the value of the deal is final. With fiat there is always a third party manipulating the value. You always get x gold or y bitcoin. But 100 usd is not really 100 usd, it all depends on what central banks and the government are plotting or printing at the moment.

Yes, the MtGox situation was strange. I had to scan in my passport and send them, wait a few days for their manual verification of it. Then figure out how to do an international bank transfer to japan, wait for a few days for that to pass, when all that had been done the price had gone from $40 to $70 so naturally I had to wait for it to come down... never did. SO I finally jumped in at $120.
Then offcourse came the site outages, you had to constantly keep an eye on the site to see if everything was working. Eventually it became clear that a paper wallet was needed.

It is just the last sell/buy price at any given exchange (there are a few different exchanges, thus a few different prices). You can make it go up by buying the available bitcoin. You can make it go down by selling bitcoin under the current price.
The price, on a larger scale is a result of supply and demand preasures of emotions such as fear or hope. Someone fears that bitcoin will be less valuable tomorrow than today? They might sell, causing the price to go down.

When designing systems keep in mind that if you look on previous data for designing the fault tolerances (think nuclear power plants + ocean waves) you automatically make it so that a rare and unprecedented event will be catastrophic. The point being that people rarely think about the possible but rare when designing systems or when thinking about their possibilities.
Bitcoin is obviously one such rare unexpected event. If you want to make money those are the events you want to keep an eye out for. Another such book is 'Blue Ocean Strategy' (think Wii, iPhone and Donald Trump)
