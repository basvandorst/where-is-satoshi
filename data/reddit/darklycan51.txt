More like a random guy who wants to create propaganda for bitcoin after massive crash by posting as an "experienced guy" Yeah... sure

It's clear what he's doing, he doesn't want to be known in the industry because he's using it as a scam.
Think of this:
Each time there's a lot of selling he could be slowly selling away his bitcoins each time they rise, since he's not "Known".
This way incase that bitcoin fails he will have all the money he made already in his pocket, quite smart to say least. If i would be the creator and i would have near 1 billion in an internet currency i would definitely start selling it.

Why? why censor, let the truth flow, bitcoin is as stable as a internet meme (hinthint memes already died with the exception of doge)

Seems like you're mad that bitcoin fell, and now you want to basically censor any comment that contains an easy way to spot for new people that bitcoin is falling.

I'm not a bitcoin supporter neither i reaaally care of it but i can tell you this, price fluctuates because there's not enough people involved in the system, and to be fair (this is my opinion) i do not think enough people will jump in to make it a stable system.

No, it will support the crap of the urban legend of the existance of a "deep web" which can't be accessed by a web browser (which is bullshit it's just encripted stuff)
