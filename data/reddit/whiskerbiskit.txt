Except that example is completely wrong.  Coinbase has to to send the funds *somehow* to the end user in exchange for fiat.  When users need to get funds out of Coinbase, they are given no other option but to push a single transaction to the blockchain.
Coinbase *could* decide to perform many withdrawals from their hot wallet at once in a single transaction, like any sane developer or DB admin would choose to do, but they don't.  That might have worked just fine a few years ago, but not today when the network is under constant attack.
I blame it on their leadership not willing to spend money improving their business logic, instead passing fees on to users.  While not overtly evil, it is stupid enough to pass for it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:53:41
Two reasons:
1. They still pay fees for their GDAX users who move money out of their site.  If they batched, they could save money.  Potentially lots of money.
2. Their users are demanding action, loudly and publicly.  Negative PR can motivate a company to do right.  Perhaps not as compelling as  *BUT* now you see their CEO responding via twitter about it, so you cannot deny it was effective in this instance.
I could argue that a company like Coinbase, literally built on BTC, has an ethical duty to help the entire community by minimizing their impact to the network.  The reality is Coinbase likely doesn't give two shits about it, and would love for a crypto to come along that could bend to the interests of multi-national corporations.
If they stopped fighting the network and instead work with it, we wouldn't be having this discussion.

The Bitcoin daemon (btcd) and the lightning network daemon (lnd) need to work together to be effective.  You would need to stand up lnd on either the same system (localhost) or another system and point it to your btcd endpoint.
Edit: 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:51:12
My point was not that Coinbase fees are too high.  Oddly enough, if you withdraw your fees through their sister site GDAX, they still pay your fee for you.  Strange right?
My point was, Coinbase still treats user withdrawals one-by-one (atomically), instead of as a big group (aggregated).  The great thing about bitcoin is you can pay lots of different people all in one transaction, and only impact the blockchain once, *instead of* impacting the blockchain every time one person wants to send money from Coinbase to themselves.
There are good alternatives to Coinbase that *do* implement batch transactions along with Segwit to reduce bloat in blocks.  That *does not* solve the current problem of Coinbase, with it's massive user base, *needlessly* making more bitcoin transactions than it needs to.  It would require *most* users abandoning the Coinbase platform in favor of one of those efficient exchanges that I talked about.  It *could* happen, but it probably won't.  
Since Coinbase is a leader in this market, it took many people in the crypto field off-guard that they have been so incredibly negligent on network efficiency.

Those with an agenda will constantly push the community to demand quick changes.  The community should resist it.
Bitcoin does not have to enable any use-case, but rather, if Bitcoin is valuable, use-cases will naturally build around it.  Angry posts demanding things get you nowhere.

@_date: 2017-12-24 02:16:01
I'm not sure what you expect, fees are working as intended.  The title  is not:  "Somebody is spamming the blockchain for free"
Developers cannot do much if there is collusion between miners to spam transactions.  Even if we rule that out, developers cannot do much if parties are willing to pay anything to get a transaction in the next block.  Assuming no foul play, BTC *users* are *willing* to pay high fees.  If you don't like it don't pay the fee and wait.

There is, it looks like a lightning bolt on an unconfirmed transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:16:33
You either have to:
1. Wait for the transaction to be dropped, [yet that is not a guarantee](
2. Wait for the transaction to get confirmed.  If  doesn't happen because technically the transaction could be in limbo for years.  This is my best option (yet frustrating) since I wasn't in a hurry.
3. Use the ledger transaction accelerator button.  I got an error when trying. _shrug_
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:09:01
Only if you cannot afford to be patient will you waste bits on a transaction.  If you can wait until an opportune time and specify your reward, you can pay the mining community appropriately.

I use fiat *because* it doesn't work that way.  I can choose either option depending on what I need.  Crypto is not so black and white.
The reason we are all here arguing our points is because we all want the currency aspect of BTC to be alive and well.  We also must live with the fact that it might not be ready for that yet.
We must stop demanding instant gratification and have some patience.  This isn't a race, it is a marathon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:51:04
You are absolutely right, I do not use it on a daily basis.  Fiat and existing financial structures work better for that right now.
I would argue that if you EVER considered using something where it was remotely possible that your fees were that wildly erratic, then you most likely have no other good options.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:05:28
Would you not get this effect by having a large grouping of miners agreeing to never include transactions under a certain sat/byte rate?
Yes, it would cost them money in the short term.  If the result is higher transaction fees from all sources, it seems to me that they would benefit overall.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:24:40
It does not work *sometimes* as a transactional currency, and that is OK.  Obviously if you need more from your crypto then other options are available.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:20:30
I would say any wallet that allows you to input your desired fee.  You will always do best by looking at the data and calculating it yourself.
Outside of that, fee estimation is a guessing game.  Wallets and exchanges try to err on the side of getting your transaction confirmed as quickly as possible and hence pay more for the luxury.

Here is the thing: everyone knows fees are bad.  Shortcuts to progress will not be taken as per the devs so there really is nothing to be done about it.  Either you adapt your way of using it OR you use a different crypto that has adapted to you.

I think disowning a member of your family, no matter how far removed they may be (she was adopted, but he had no problems signing "Grandpa" on her Xmas cards), on the basis of an interview just underscores his disconnection with reality.

I would imagine the cost and the risk of failure are both too high to do so.  You either have to A) hire one of the *very* few expert developers in the crypto space who are probably *not* motivated by money, or B) hire an extremely competent developer, engineer, or academic who can get up-to-speed with Bitcoin *quickly*.  In either case, a ton of money could get spent for an idea that goes nowhere.  I sincerely doubt that a company would propose a change out of 100% *altruism* and not what is in their best interest.
Companies do not typically deal in consensus.  They want to do what is best for them and if it happens to help others, so be it.
I agree with Alex on his entire point, however for the question of motivation, this should come as a surprise to exactly no one.

I think of it this way: Luke solves problems.  No Segwit? UASF.  No UASF? PoW change.  Etc etc.
This is a valuable service to the community because he can be a powerful source of compelling *alternatives* to the miner narrative.  Miners see this and think "shit, a PoW change *would* screw me pretty badly..." and it can change behavior.  Perhaps they attack him, perhaps they launch social media campaigns, but in any event they cannot stop other actors from seeing the alternatives of one group saying "my way or else!"
Whether his idea is dangerous or not is not the point.  The very threat changes the narrative.  His UASF campaign showed how this worked in practice.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:46:06


If the change they are proposing is not technically sound, then they have no other choice.  The S2X crowd realized that no matter what, there was *nothing* they could do or say to convince the community that their change was an improvement to the protocol.  There was nothing they could do or say to force the issue.
The permissionless part is not saying "hey, any change is welcome," it is saying "any change that passes technical muster is welcome."

There is ample material available on the internet to educate you as to why the LN makes technical sense.  The problem is, learning about complex systems like this is more like *work* than *fun*.
In laymans terms, the LN allows trivial payment transactions to be separated from the blockchain.  This scares the industry players that make money off of transactions that are on the blockchain.  Simple as that.

The OP even used the term 'fake news.'
You seem to think your beliefs allow you to attack people personally and look down upon them from a moral high ground: unassailable, undeniably correct just by virtue of having the 'real story' that you cannot substantiate with evidence.  Your attempts to persuade people with this hollow narrative will continue to be fruitless, because they will see your efforts as vain pandering to your own fears and anxiety.
Your beliefs don't give you an excuse to attack others and behave in this way.  It is rude and childish at _best_.
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:46:56

I completely agree but I have to do something.  Whenever I used to see people acting this way I would just roll my eyes, and _assume_ people like me see it for what it is.  But apparently that is not enough in the information age.  I used to be confident that having these folks shout this nonsense would show everyone how utterly unfounded their misinformation is.  But said enough times, with enough vehemence and conspiratorial emotion can triumph over legitimate, honest journalists.

It would only be a scam to miners if one party purposely promised to run segwit2x and then reneged on that promise at a later date.  Users and folks running core nodes were not part of that agreement or discussion.  NYA was between the signed companies of that charter and *no one else*.
As it stands today, ~5600 core software nodes and ~1300 uasf nodes (compared to ~1200 of all others combined) tell me that the 2x is destined for altcoin status if it were to happen.  You have some mining pools (40% who signalled segwit with no conditions?) who I suspect would be ready to pick up the pieces of a chain split due to the looming hard fork.

This is perhaps Greg's most salient point:




meaningfully improves the scale or scalablity but rather it's just a
bailout to temporarily lower/negate transaction fees.  It doesn't seem
to make any argument (or even acknowledge) that the risks and
disruption are worth its benefit, and it exacerbates those risks by
being the product of a closed process and having a timeline shorter
than basically any software update for production software (much less
the timeframe for any consensus update previously). Kudos for being
frank here, but it's not exactly selling itself.

1) Perhaps as-is, but there are longer-term solutions for addressing the quantum threat.  From what I understand, quantum computers are really only good for a few things, i.e., breaking crypto.
2) Bitcoin isn't given or distributed, it is mined by making blocks.  There is also no one governance body to distribute it.  Who decides who gets what?  That would be ripe for abuse.
3) nothing stops a government from making their own, in fact some are signalling their intent to do so right now.  My question for you is, why would I use the crypto of zimbabwe over bitcoin?
4) You are in control of your monetary destiny with bitcoin.  Banks are not needed when you have a stable and secure network along with a bullet-proof codebase.  I would argue that you (and I!) are not equal to the global elite no matter what currency you use.

Other ideas that have more technical merit can come along from anywhere.  Up until now the community thought that technical merit for ideas would cause no political issues such as this.  Why would it?  A good idea is a good idea, right?
Well, as it turns out, if you and a few sympathetic competitors control substantial hashpower, you can hold progress hostage in exchange for code changes that would not otherwise pass community voting, like the blocksize increase.
I am not against a blocksize increase *in theory*, but I am starting to be against one *in practice* because this would show miners that holding the network hostage *works*.  I am against UASF *in practice* because of the risk, but I am all for the *threat* of a UASF to break the stalemate.
Voting, and signalling support for BIPs such as Segwit, allow everyone to understand that no one party is forcing anything on anyone.
 
* Core isn't forcing Segwit; if it doesn't activate then it is back to the drawing board for everyone involved
* Core isn't forcing UASF; on the contrary, the devs I have read have stated that UASF is not tested thoroughly enough yet and poses significant *unknown* risk
* Core isn't against Segwit2mb, they want the interested parties to go through the proper process and testing
* Core isn't against a blocksize increase; any code change is open to scrutiny and network-at-large acceptance

Schnorr signatures would help with this by making spamming attacks cost even more, so eventually, yes.

Fees will be a problem as long as wallets and exchanges set them for us.  Reasonable fees are possible today at around 30 sat/byte.

The things is, I suspect it doesn't have to work in order to actually get the desired outcome.  I am hoping the UASF threat will be enough motivation to get this whole fiasco over with.

Since segwit is in the latest release already, the core devs wanted assurances that any changes would start from that baseline.  If they get the NYC code ready then miners would upgrade and start mining segwit blocks and BIP148 should be a non issue.  6 months later after adequate testing the HF would occur in theory.

I believe they Segwit2mb folks agreed to use the existing segwit implementation as a starting point.

Core devs don't support it for some very good, non-trivial reasons.  You are making it seem trivial and that is disingenuous.

If you have 0.13 or later, you are already segwit ready.  You are not, however, signalling support for the UASF, which requires you to edit your config file.

TL;DR is timelines and activation/signalling.  Have you read the technical details behind this proposal and seen the criticism?  It was not hard to find.

From what I have read of their own interactions and the interactions of others, you have to have IMMENSE knowledge of all the moving pieces of the codebase.  This codebase is meant to be taken very seriously and they are not about to pull punches on folks.  This type of sentiment exists all over high-profile open source projects; just look at the linux kernel.
A dev team likes and dislikes their own ideas internally and that is how we end up with some ideas being the best proposal put forth.  You cannot take a PR or MR from the public and not scrutinize the hell out of it with unit and integration tests, as well as performance testing and mock production modeling on a test net.  Billions of dollars ride on this stuff, you cannot just take someones word at "trust me, this is a great idea and it will work." 
Technical merit is the driving factor at the end of the day.  I have seen them openly state "prove why X is better than Y" and if you can't, why would any sane and reasonable person take that risk?

~~So instead of having a way to get their data back, they get...nothing instead?  How does that prove a lesson to anyone?  Criminals still get their bitcoin and the hapless victims are left clueless.~~
Kaspersky says the intent is to wipe data and not to make money so the point is moot: intact inbox or not, nobody will be getting a decryption key.  I still stand by my point that keeping an inbox up would not constitute promotion of criminal behavior, and was a misguided move by the provider.

I had no idea was Greg Maxwell.  TIL

BIP148 was authored by ShaolinFry? Or was it luke-jr?  In either case, the main reason why it isn't an ideal solution is due to the lack of testing, correct?

Forgive my ignorance of the specifics of LN and BIP37 in particular: you mentioned this being well-suited for mobile clients, which of the index sizes do you think would be most likely?  6.9GB is a lot different than 0.58GB especially on mobile.
Awesome work, btw.  Makes me realize how little I actually know about computer science. ��

The general feeling from all parties is BIP91 could happen on time.  It would signal and be coupled with a later HF for blocksize increase.  All devs involved have gotten past key preliminary hurdles based on signalling and rehashing of Segwit.  The miner crowd is behind this as well and the link is Jeff quoting Wu on his show of support.

There is no consensus.
A few very large mining outfits in China are starting to signal support for their plan (segwit2x) which has some very serious and non-trivial issues and flaws that have yet to be worked out.  Yes, it would technically activate segwit BUT the later hardfork they want will be contentious.
The architects of this agreement are loudly proclaiming victory on twitter and elsewhere.  Why?  Because it is in their best interest to do so.  The Segwit2X plan hijacks a feature that has broad support (segwit) and holds it hostage to miner demands of bigger blocks, which may or may not be necessary.  The NYA architects want the public to think they are being reasonable, prudent, and acting in good faith when they are not.
Bitcoin is not a legal system or framework, nor is it a political system of self-imposed rules on human beings that is left sometimes to legal interpretation.  In a system like that, compromise is important and I would say mandatory.  In Bitcoin and in this case especially, compromise can mean very powerful parties forcing rules on the whole ecosystem for their benefit alone.
It was a mistake to require such a high bar for Segwit activation and if nothing else, this whole debate has been a great learning experience for everyone involved with Bitcoin.  I hope it serves as a lasting reminder that consensus rules can be gamed by powerful players (Bitmain) and that the rest of the community still has tools to fight back (UASF) and will use them if forced to.
