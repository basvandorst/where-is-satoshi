Thanks for the insight it's much appreciated :)

So basically if I buy BTC/LTC or whatever I could potentially be a "criminal" just by simply purchasing and selling BTC through a service like gdax or Coinbase?

No, nor did I take the time to read your comment here.

Do you need to submit earnings to the IRS if you "cash out"

So I'm still a little new to BTC should I move my BTC out from my nano s back to my Coinbase/gdax account??
Edit: maybe nevermind??? I'm reading this is a fake fork/scam now...

I will once I decide to leave the BTC community. I don't plan on messing with the IRS lol

Have fun when the IRS knocks on your door then.

Can confirm since I work in the medical field. We'll use this symbol when we perform procedures with Contrast Media.

You should never be in 100% only in with what you can afford to lose.

I don't plan to sell for a while unless BTC goes crazy high randomly in which it does I'll have a better idea of what to do. Thanks :)

Sure. Write me a letter from prison when you're nailed for tax evasion, friend.

I'm going to switch from Coinbase to Bitstamp later today. Thank you for this post and all the information. I already use a legacy nano s as well so I'm good there! This is a great post, friend!

You're quite butt hurt.

Make sure to jiggle the card reader before using it.

Depends, are you anti or pro vax?

I'm not too familiar with LN. Is this available via mobile wallets or what's up?

This needs more upvotes. Not only is it appropriate but it stirs nostalgia.

It's still crazy to me thinking people took out loans or second mortgages to invest...
