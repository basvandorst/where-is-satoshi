Or just a [CME like the one we saw in 2012]( that just missed the earth by one week or so.  IF it had hit us, we would have satellites knocked out of the sky, no internet and worldwide power outages lasting several years.
But I guess at that point we will have bigger problems to deal with than crashing bitcoin prices.

Almost everyone I talk to about bitcoin has heard of it (I was surprised to learn that even my 71 year old mother-in-law heard about bitcoin), but most people have no idea what it is, how it works or how to use it.
I must say, compared to a year ago, there seems to be much less negativity/skepticism in peoples attitudes towards bitcoin though.

I bet there are at least a few bitcoin related "20% time for side projects" on the go.

I was actually being serious...  There is some debate about this, but basically if the super high voltage transformers go, we are fucked for quite a while.  Replacing even 1 could take up to 2 years according to studies.  There would need some co-ordinated effort to come up with an interim solution. ([this article]( mentioned a "transformer trio" as a temp solution, or an early detection system to warn power companies to shut down power)
This is a real risk, and a small group of people at NASA are getting paid to come up with a solution to this and other catastrophic dangers from space.

At this point the government has no idea what they are talking about when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  And, it will probably take them a while to really grasp the concept and implications.

I checked the comments...  The hate is strong.  I scrolled down a few pages and I couldn't find one positive comment.  This is pretty typical whenever bitcoin is mentioned outside of on reddit.

That is so true.  The only people I know with windows phone are my brother-in-law (works at MS) and his wife.  They are also the only people I hear using the phrase "Bing it" instead of "Google it"... its cute :)

If you're day trading, you're transferring an amount you're willing to lose anyway (hopefully), so I don't see a problem day trading on any exchange... btc-e, crypsty, etc.  Just don't keep your stash there.

Sorry to hear that...  I causally mined around 15 BTC back in 2012 with an average video card and ended up selling them to a friend for around $10/btc.  
It still burns my ass that I didn't hold onto them today, but it was a different world back then.
Hopefuly you were an early adopter, but either way... cheers man.

Andreas is very well spoken, and I think is one of the best spokespeople for bitcoin right now.  Its clear he has a deep understanding, but at the same time he can articulate it very well to the masses.

Cool.  I would definitely be interested in block accounts.  I'm currently using BlockNews, but I would switch to your service for the ability to pay with bitcoin.

I'm currently using blocknews.net, but I will instantly sign up to bitusenet as soon as they offer block accounts (which is in the works according to a [previous post](

Thanks for the advice, but I'm a bit of a newb and I'm just starting to look at different options for buying/selling at this point.  Not looking for any specific amount of coins.  Just looking for a reliable source to make a successful transaction into my wallet.
Also, I have recently starting mining with some success and I'm also looking for places to spend my coins.  Honestly, I would rather not exchange them for dollars if I don't have to.
@_date: 2012-10-26 19:00:46
The transaction fees are also rewarded to the miners.  Currently they are pretty small, but this will become the main reward for miners in the future, and will probably grow to provide incentive.

If you have a TD bank account, you can setup canadianbitcoins as a personal payee through telephone banking, and then buy bitcoins using the online bill payment feature.  I find this to be the most convenient. You can do the same thing with cavirtex, but you need to be verified.  
Localbitcoins is probably a cheaper option, but I don't mind paying a little more for the convenience
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:39:26
That's kind of the point.  One of the goals in the creation of bitcoin was to destroy the central banking system.  Look at the quote that Satoshi put into the genesis block:

Saw [this]( posted here a few days ago actually.   (they started accepting Bitcoin).  Seems like it could be useful for this purpose.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:08:56
I think you can include TD Bank in Canada.  I used to buy from canadianbitcoins.com using the bill pay feature a few months ago.  Then all of a sudden the option was no longer there.  I emailed them about it and they said:
 "TD is no longer an option. TD wasn't playing nice with Bitcoin and we have had to close our account with TD"

I just saw a post here a few days ago about the Libertarian Party of Canada and they had a bitcoin donation page setup but were not accepting because of this exact reason.  It said they were looking into it.
Well, seems things have changed in the last few days.  They now have a bitcoin address you can do use for [donations](

I was using blockchain.info up until a few days ago as my primary wallet.  I do trust the site and still use it as a watch-only wallet, but I've had issues recently with logging in. 
Sometimes the password and/or 2 factor authentication text boxes would not appear, and I could not log in.   I got paranoid that I would lock myself out of my wallet.
The only way I could access my bitcoin was through the app on my phone.  Then I realized that just having the app on my phone and pairing it to my blockchain wallet was extremely insecure.  If I ever lost my phone, there goes my bitcoin...  no password needed to transfer all the funds to another wallet.
I opted to go with the Bitcoin Armory client and created multiple digital and paper backups.  I feel more secure hosting my coins locally.  I've even deleted my wallet and restored the backup multiple times just to make myself feel secure.

Depends on how much debt you are in from funding your education.  I'm about the same age, but I only did an undergrad degree so my debt is not as much as someone who went to medical or law school.
In the long run they will make more money than me, but at 30, they might still be in debt or have a small amount of savings.  I've been working for 13 years and I've managed so save around $180,000 in total (including down payment for a house)
@_date: 2013-03-13 03:17:32
Agreed.  Love the "what just happened" responses, lol.
@_date: 2013-03-27 07:07:06
Yes... miners enable bitcoin to exist... and eventually when all 21 million bitcoin have been mined, transaction fees will have to naturally grow to provide miners incentive to continue mining and securing the network, etc.  
It's a beautiful thing.

He got some of the terminology wrong (e.g. chainblock), but for the most part it was a very positive interview and explained bitcoin to a mainstream audience very well.

I'm in Canada too, but I've been investing slowly over time (mainly using cavirtex, btw).  I only have around 1k, right now, but I bought it slowly over time, starting in Oct. of last year.   I typically invest that way regardless... slowly over time (dollar cost averaging).

I heard about it back in 2010, but never really looked into more details.  
I took another look in Sep-Oct 2012 when the price was around $9-10.  I started mining and in a few months had mined about 8 BTC. 
I played around with buying a few more on various exchanges at around $30 a couple months later.  
Eventually, I had about 12 BTC, which I ended up selling to a friend who wanted to buy to use on SilkRoad. I now only have a small amount, but I wish I still had that 12 BTC.

VirtEx is good, and I had no issues with customer support.  Took  a few days to verify the account, but i've had no issues.  
Once I even transferred them money via bill payment method and I forgot to fill out the deposit form first.  I emailed customer support and they straightened it out for me.

Yes, Bitcoin is still relatively small.  According to wikipedia the global hedge fund market was over 2 trillion dollars as of April 2012.  Bitcoin market cap is less than 0.2 trillion at current prices.
