Congratulations on your purchase.  You now have more bitcoins than over 99% of the world :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:47:05
   All say it is up.  I was watching trades being broadcasted from the API too...
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:31:11
They cannot get access to your computer.  Mine was a cache issue.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:24:54
No because there are barely any trades going on and not many in queue.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:16:01
How is a day trader supposed to do that?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:12:48
Hell yes!!!!  I'd do it again if I had the chance :D

I HAVE 449.492882 LAGCOINS!
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:32:48
I hate the 0.02 trades causing lag
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:15:26
My problem has been solved.  It was a cache issue.  I don't know about the few others in the thread.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:44:43
I'm guessing yes.  I've read on reddit that they will be streaming to API when the fees are back.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:26:00
Not at all sir.  I feel for you though.  If you need to work some issues out with someone, I'm here :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:52:45
Because it goes by mtgox last trade not btc-e last trade.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:58:39
Yeah I just had to delete my cache and cookies.  I'm just waiting to hear back from the people who supposedly lost coins.  The cache issue doesn't explain that at all.

Each exchange has it's own separate order book.  The order book dictates the price.  Supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:41:14
SATOSHI THE CYBER CHRIST!!!
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:31:42
I emailed support almost a week ago about something unrelated and never received a response.

Why not use bitspend.net ???
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:30:36
I made my account.  I got preoccupied with other things.  I went back to the tab which had my profile and it said my email wasn't verified yet.  I opened btc-e in another window and tried to login and it did not work.  I never received an email from them either.  I thought it was a fluke but I decided not to use them.
EDIT: Was a cache issue.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:56:04
Yeah I have no other account.  Okay don't buy a single coin lol.  I was actually being serious and I'm sorry you aren't very trusting of others.  I just bought my first coins two days ago.  Over 5 grand.   and 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:36:27
I used a new password when I signed up.  Thank goodness.

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:08:54
I count it as a loss as good measure but I believe it will come back.  I spent $6,000 at $200 a coin.  I have never sold any.  I haven't told anyone yet.  I invested everything I have.  I ignored it.  I don't go on IRC.  Long live bitcoin indeed!

@_date: 2013-04-12 22:26:43
That happened to me too.

Old repost
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:33:22
No.  The site is up the trading is down.  Paused at $180 USD

I think everyone knows this by now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:25:54
eBay sellers accepting paypal regularly get scammed due to customers fraudulently requesting chargebacks.  That is why bitcoins sell for more on eBay.

Government.  What did I win?
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:04:47
So it's like this man won the superball and it was only worth like twenty cents?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:44:26
With the quality of the shit they build, probably.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:22:42
Hell yes!

Your local weather's bubble popped?!
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:11:14
    
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:34:48
Do you accept chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:12:52

Over a bridge on tor.  Not shiny but it'll suffice.

I don't compare to paper I compare to Italian supercars

Doing better than me.  Be happy :)

They are only sending data to their API every five minutes.

That actually worked!  Now if that works for the other few then I guess we're golden.

It was a cache issue for me.

I guess it's about time for bed then.

I spent all my money ($6,000) at $200 a coin and this is the most fun I've had in a long time.  Watching the charts and tickers and reading everything :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:28:51
It gained that in two weeks.  The housing market didn't gain 30% in two weeks.  We are ABOVE what we were at three weeks ago.

No no no!  Who builds upside down pyramids?  Then the last people would be the richest!  The person who lures you in fucks you and you bring in more people and fuck them who bring in more people.  The first people win the last people lose.

The same thing that happened when they made downloading music and movies illegal.

Go for it!  Use bitstamp.net to get it cheap.  It feels good to own a bitcoin :)
