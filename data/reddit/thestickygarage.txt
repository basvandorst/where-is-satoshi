Amen to that Amen brother.

I believe it would be a great investment, but it would go against everything Bitcoin was created to be.

Just read something that said Q3 Sept 30th.

This guy coins.

99 problems and vocabulary is one.

I’m definitely a lot more aware of what’s going on in the Financial System and how crooked it is. Makes me sound like a lunatic when I’m talking with my friends.

Just waiting for the OTC supply to diminish and then we’ll start to see real movement.

Tell em' how it be like sometimes, 100% of the time.

They are and I don’t really blame her. But I just wanted to lead her to the water and was hoping she would show a little more interest in it. Then if she said no, I’d be fine. I grabbed some Sats for her anyways if she ever shows interest in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:46:13
Lol worth it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:20:08
Tried explaining Bitcoin to my mother back when we were around $3,500, she said to me, well I think I’m going to miss out on this one I just don’t trust it. Now 6 months later we’re dancing around $10,000. Something that would’ve taken the S&amp;P 500 Ten good years to accomplish.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:17:11
Lol did the same, oh a dip, wow that’s cute.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:14:09
I was indeed talking about the national debt while you were talking about the annual budget deficit. Good day sir.

I made the mistake of watching this guy for a little while, what a waste of time. He just states 3-5 outcomes and then says, “but I don’t know, let me know in the comments what you guys think” 
His 3-5 outcomes conveniently have the price going up, down or sideways. It’s laughable, and I can’t believe it took me a couple weeks to realize. I guess I was just caught up in the excitement. 
His name is Crypto Zombie, don’t waste your time.
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:30:11
The deficit was not shrinking by any means, slowing down maybe but it was not shrinking.
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:37:10
You can DCA and still buy dips. I understand the difference between the two. If you have an allotment of money and want to DCA it’s still advantageous to buy a quick 10% dip.
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:13:41
There’s no such thing as a “wealth of data” in this space.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:12:48
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:57:50
Lmao How many comments here are OP?
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:15:55
It’s been around for 10 years, and it’s easily manipulated by whales. TA is a waste of time. Buy and hold. That simple.
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:31:34
I’m here, I DCA when I can and I’ll be prepared in the event that this does happen. Not complaining at all, just stating the fact that this would be devastating for more people than you can fathom. I’m a huge fan of everything Bitcoin stands for, but the fallout would be one of the worst things the modern era would ever experience.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:47:37
I know what you’re saying and you know what I’m saying. I’m not sitting here calling for an 8k BTC. If there’s a $1k dip, you buy. Not a TA Guy

I can only see Vegeta so many times, I’m already dead inside. Helps me hodl though.
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:05:36
And he just got Sanu, bullish for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:07:36
If I were a millionaire I would own 3-5, even if I didn’t believe. I’m working on joining the 21M club at the moment but I can only chip away little Sats at a time.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:16:07
Dollar Cost Average my friend, don’t blow your load all at once. Buy every dip until you’re in a position you’re comfortable with.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:56:12
While this sounds great, it’s not a world we would want to live in. Things would get very ugly for a lot of people.
@_date: 2019-12-09 04:44:37
Getting EMP’ed would be a pretty shitty day, but at least I’d still have the pleasure of knowing that I don’t have to share a country with your dumbass. (Who would probably sell too early on the way up anyways).

It’s hilarious how they all started pitching that this was a personal attack on Bitcoin, like the government was in control of YouTube and ordered the “hit”
Nope sorry just a misunderstanding, and half of the YouTubers are shitcoin promoters or shoot hopium into the veins of impressionable investors. With titles like “BITCOIN READY FOR EXPLOSIVE MOVE?!?!”
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:30:08
Yeah had nothing to do with Tether.

Is this Nuggets News?
Please god no, I would watch all of these videos.

You know what lol, I changed my mind YouTube can step in.
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:39:01
Thanks! I figure this will help me learn a little more, but that’s good to know and I’m going to look into it.
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:40:32
Awesome! Thanks for taking the time to help out!

A “Bitcoin enthusiast and salesman” explains why Bitcoin should be in everyone’s portfolio.

Looking forward to the initial dump, waiting for a nice discount.
