Totally agreed about the dystopian similarities with China's social credit system. Unfortunately it's true, any member of CIFAS essentially sends a form to CIFAS and then the marker starts until you force it's removal. I just feel really bad for others who don't know about finance who are effectively trapped. People undoubtedly would have killed themselves over matters like this.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:48:17
I certainly think the way the CIFAS system works is close to criminal. Certainly very difficult to get justice
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:17:29
Thank you. I would say judging by the amount of private messages I've had asking for help (since yesterday) definitely more than one and that's just Barclays.
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:17:47
I shall let you know!
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:51:32
I'm just so relieved I got it reviewed. Genuinely, at times, I sometimes thought about bad things... I'm just glad it's over. I can be happy again.
If it's happening to anyone else please know their is help.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:46:57
No they shut down my account. Don't think I'll ever use them again.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:30:32
Have your ombudsman cases completed yet if you don't mind me asking? I've been reading the ombudsman decision notices and almost all of them with "bitcoin" mentioned are not overturned.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:49:45
When the executive tried to unmask a whistleblower and faced virtually 0 repercussions really did it for me.
Or when they gave me an unarranged overdraft at 16 and I had to ask the ombudsman for around £500 in charges back. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:56:09
About 6 months after it was placed on my account I applied for a loan (I work in banking) and know my credit is better than UK average. I kept getting declined so I put a data access request (under GDPR) and CIFAS posted out confirmation of the marker.
@_date: 2019-11-08 23:21:18
I was wondering if the USA had an equivalent version. But yes sorry if I oversimplified it quite Lot but that's spot on.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:17:16
I'll never know if they fleeced me or not. But the bank refused to refund me. So either its done poor soul who has their account hacked or someone is shouting their with my money and my btc.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:41:10
Yes same situation. I think it's likely money laundering suspicions when they can't get their head around transactions they just panic and because tipping off is an offence they simply don't talk to you and it becomes crazy difficult. Also hugely embarrassing going into branch multiple times when they ask you too, only to be turned away again and again.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:18:46
Yes it's actually called a Cifas entry but sometimes referred to as a marker. Think you're on to something with the multiple accounts!
@_date: 2019-11-08 22:20:39
Well you could feasibily appeal it if you can prove to CIFAS that the bank applied it unlawfully. However you should consider complaining to the bank first so you can use that as proof to CIFAS you are unsatisfied with the action.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:47:13
Thank you so much it was quite stressful!
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:54:00
Thank you! This helped and I had it removed. I just hope others can too.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:36:13
I'd love to see some kind of Bitcoin bank but ran as a co-op for the members.
I'm sorry you've been dicked about. Barclays was my first bank too, always thought I'd stay with them forever. Wouldn't ever go near them again.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:29:13
I'm glad you managed matey. I know the stress of feeling trapped is pretty awful. I'm happy you made it out :)
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:30:46
No, working in banking I already have accounts elsewhere, however for those concerned I believe Monzo will open a basic account for people with CIFAS markers. I would not have been able to open a high street bank account or any bank or building society associated with CIFAS.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:45:45
Hey thanks for your comment. So because the amount that they held back didn't line up with any of the LBC transactions I didn't know which one to dispute (I wouldn't want to get anyone's account banned for getting it wrong accidentally). I did dispute it with Barclay's at the time, and it formed part of my complaint, but now reading this I'm feeling foolish because I don't think I raised it with LBC. However I've offered the ombudsman any and all access if required.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:31:24
I honestly get that. I think I brought it up with them that the amount didn't match up but they weren't really being forthcoming with anything. My assumption was that it could have been a reversal + a charge (idk a reversal charge?) but even then it would have been too close to call on LBC.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:18:36
Hi that's not entirely true, although if I get a mortgage with my partner we will have issues, a CIFAS marker is against the person not the address (although does not address history).
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:30:26
I think I'd be nervous face to face. I'm a big ish guy and could handle my own but I naively relied on the security of UK banking.
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:57:15
That would be fucking awesome
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:13:04
To be fair, it's things like this (hearing stories from others about bad banking) that got me into bitcoin in the first place lol
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:45:37
Thank you David. So this is currently in two stages, one complaint since last year is currently being looked at by the FOS (they've began the fact finding phase) and a septate complaint under GDPR as I'm challenging the accuracy (as it's merely an allegation at this stage). Just wish I could stop having panic attacks over it.
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:47:10
To clarify, once there money reached my account the btc was released.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:21:22
Hey, so I'm being as open as I can. I bought the coins from Coinbase using faster payment (around 3k total but I'd need to double check) and sold via LBC. So in total there were probably around 10 to 15 transactions over the week?
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:34:45
Thank you for your advice.
I have an account elsewhere for now that I can rely on. My real terror is the idea that once a year banks tend to re-run AML checks and I'm terrified of having my only account closed at some random point in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:22:19
Well thankfully the UK government has agreed to adopt GDPR regardless of the Brexit outcome. Thanks though. I just want justice.
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:46:35
Hi Patreli, I've not thought about that but it may make sense. In my head that money is a write off but if it gives me any better legal standing I'd consider it.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:46:29
Done that! Thank you, I'll keep you updated on the outcome (well this thread anyway)
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:19:16
I don't think they would have if they didn't know their own account was compromised. I would assume someone just noticed the money left (maybe an sms alert?) and then I assume they called their bank who traced it but its all just a guess.
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:06:37
Yeah I hope you're right buddy. I did write that in my complaint so hopefully FOS will listen to calls and the full complaint.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:19:15
Not yet but I've heard they are good for CIFAS issues thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:21:10
Wish I could eat the loss as you say! I don't mind being down £200 for a lesson learnt. But not being able to buy my dream home in Wales is killing me. That place is beautiful and damn I feel like I need to escape sometimes.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:10:55
Unfortunately as part of opening a UK Bank account, a CIFAS check is done. So with this mark on my account I am trapped and cannot open a bank account now.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:21:29
If you need any help let me know :)
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:08:26
Thank you
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:43:20
I'm sorry to hear that. Taking one bank away from the equation is an issue. Rendering us unbanked is another. I hope you find a way! Best of luck.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:54:02
Hey I don't know what any of that means I just did faster payments inwards for verified users only. I don't like shady. Literally just faster payment to coinbase, send btc to LBC then sell in smallish increments.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:17:58
That's really interesting thanks mate.
Might have to go on an EU account opening spree before Brexit fucks everything up lol
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:12:59
Thank you friend. My panic attacks are getting smaller and more manageable. I will find a way eventually.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:32:45
I can only make a reasonable assumption
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:06:10
They are reversible. All UK banks can reverse faster payments but you have to quickly claim to the bank it was in the wrong account or work in the bank yourself.
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:08:53
It's horrible to think it's happening to others. I read your article, I hope LBC works with the banks in the future to stop this.
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:47:12
Absolutely, at least I'd have something I could defend myself against.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:36:06
My friend that would be hilarious.
I can only hope lol.
I'm part of the great Mtgox creditors so you never know!
@_date: 2019-09-17 10:39:48
I'm glad you have something to support you. I'm waiting for my main bank to eventually abandon me I just hope they don't. It's crazy to think that one person inputting this information can have such a devastating effect.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:28:38
They didn't,when I went in to branch (the first of multiple times) I brought my ID and asked for my most recent statement. That's where I saw the reversal.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:25:42
Yup defo learnt that the hard way
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:09:20
I'll keep the thread updated once I find out hopefully in the next month.
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:58:46
It was my childhood bank too!
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:54:08
Hi I noticed that I didn't really answer your question. The strange thing is that the amount Barclay's recouped didn't actually match any amount from LBC. So as the amounts is sold were setting the same (approx £200) I couldn't identify which one it was. Although I did get a few bizarre DMs asking for more business weeks after it happened.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:16:31
Hi thank you for your reply. I read about national hunter and have everything ready in work to post the SAR over today (I don't think they accept email SARs) I suppose it would be worth telling the FOS to remove it from there too if they uphold it.
And I think you're right. The information on CIFAS is nothing more than one person's opinion so hopefully I can challenge that.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:34:32
Cheers matey. I have moments where I just don't think about it and it's great, then I'll see an advert for a nice house and I'm just like.... ARRRRGGGH... feeling it in my chest. But cheers though I'll try to keep the thread updated of the outcome.
@_date: 2019-09-17 07:08:02
That makes a lot of sense. Especially when I look at the feedback from the buyers they all have very good payment history.
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:23:27
Yes. I don't know enough about them to have an intelligent discussion, but from cursory looks it appears if you're doing this as a business or corporation (e.g. Consistently doing it with view to profit in the long term) then you could be classed as an unlicensed money transmitter. I don't believe it covers people who arbitrage every now and then.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:03:45
I would guess that one individual has reversed the transaction. (ordered statements after I found out and saw one transaction taken out of my account and put in a suspense account).
Unfortunately selling bitcoin via local bitcoins and using Barclay's certainly is a cat 6 fraud warning. Well it is for me at least.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:43:02
All banks check CIFAS before an account is opened. So the chance of me finding another bank is slim to none unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:51:56
Well hopefully, like me, you will find support in others. Just talking to you folks helps.
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:46:40
If you don't mind me asking, how have you managed so far? Both in terms of where you got upto with the complaint and in yourself?
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:42:24
All good ideas! Please don't delete this comment I might come back to it sometime soon!
