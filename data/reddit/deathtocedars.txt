Do you stay up at night worried about the beef cartel price fixing because they have special markets that sell cows by the dozen? Is it unfair that you don't get to influence the price of ground beef when you're buying it by the pound at retail instead of by the ton from wholesaler?
People with substantially more money than you decide to conduct transactions with each other at volumes that you can't handle. Sometimes entrepreneurs create marketplaces that facilitate those types of transactions.
I don't want or need to buy bitcoins by the thousand, just like I don't need to buy ground beef by the cow. Maybe you're right and people are doing something nefarious with a new exchange for rich people; we should probably just stick with MtGox.

The following is in the source code, in the bg.js file of 1.4. I suspect they are all scam addresses.

It's a good thing because they can act as infrastructure to other entities.
If you want to buy 100 shares of Ford, you don't call the NYSE and place an order, you work with a brokerage. The brokerage handles a lot of mundane details (filing tax forms, verifying identities, dealing with small money transfers) that have absolutely nothing to do with the business of running an exchange.
If you want companies like Amazon and Walmart to start doing any kind of business in Bitcoin, you need a system where they reasonably believe they can do more than a million dollars worth of transactions at once without moving the market significantly. Buying $1 million worth of bitcoin on bitstamp right now would move the market from ~500 to between 525 and 530. It looks like $10M would blow through the entire sell side of the order book that is displayed on bitcoinwisdom.
Real companies don't deposit funds into accounts in Slovenia or with Magic The Gathering Online eXchange. Senior Vice Presidents get laughed out of the room for bullshit like that. It's great if the CEO of Overstock is a forward thinker and believes in the ideology and promise of Bitcoin, but he's an early adopter. Bitcoin needs a safe place to trade 1000 BTC for $500,000 all at once.
Bitcoin is a powerful decentralizing tool, but it doesn't change the reality that you use different mechanisms and create different infrastructure to service 1000 accounts that each have $100M than you do to service 100M accounts that each have $1000 in them.
