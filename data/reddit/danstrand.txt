Make them shine?
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:28:29
I will. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:24:58
Yes, this is an issue that keeps coming up, so it must be key knowledge in the game. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:24:49
Ok, I'll have to check it out. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:24:10
At the moment I don't need to worry about that...but maybe soon. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:00:31
Good advice. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:38:10
Meget interessant. Hvor kan jeg høre det i etterkant?

Could its value not be manipulated by a government mass buy?
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:45:39
I would be interested in hearing how this worked out for you...
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:55:16
Please tell...
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:28:06
I like the "Dutch auction" style. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:57:23
Thank you very much for the advice, it will for sure be of value. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:55:03

I got a BlockChain wallet today...
@_date: 2014-11-01 05:11:07
Sign me up. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:57:02

@_date: 2014-10-24 22:05:45
It is safe? Where is it based out of? What limits are played?
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:56:34
Is kryptokit an app? 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:49:08
What is the site? And how many runners?
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:02:28
As usual, the news is steady digging for new angles to old stories. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:44:08
Yeah, but it might be worth it in the end.
