Right, but I think any future hardfork has to be proven before hand. The last part was just an idea about increasing stability.

Not even that it just has to do what it says and be able to compete with the other large currencies that can transfer coins in minutes or even seconds. It just has to be well thought out and NOT community driven, because most people don’t have a clue what would be good or not.

The BCC happened way too early and really messed things up. If anyone is to blame for the lack of progression it is those who were short sighted and adopted BCC. I think another hard fork will be detrimental until it is proven that a hard fork will solve all the bitcoin network and transaction fee problem. I personally don’t use bitcoin at all due to the astronomically high fees. I do all my Binance trading in ethereum. Also if possible they need to increase the total supply from 16mil to 160 mil or 1.6b. The higher volume crypto currencies have been much better with stability.

I think it has to do with Trump tax reform and overvaluation. I read that with the new corporate tax rate some analyst believe a 4% YoY growth possible. That could lead to some major gains in the stock market with a much lower degree of volatility and implied risk. I also think people want to take their money and run since the price is still relatively high. For example.. let’s say you doubled your investment if you take out your initial investment you basically have a “risk free” investment.

This is just one of many food trucks in your area used for **MONEY LAUNDERING** or **TAX EVASION**. 
As a matter of fact, they sold 50,000 tacos last month.

That really was not my point. You are thinking in terms of present value. I am saying some people mine, because they believe prices will rise. So that $3 could be worth $30 or $.30. 
It’s also more complicated than your pay off your initial investment, because you have to take into account your hardware resale value. If the depreciation grows at a slower rate then you are mining you have made profit sooner than you have made more than if you calculated for $0 resale value. It’s hard to tell depreciation value and I won’t argue with that.

It depends. That cool profit could be worth $1000s one day or nothing at all. Some people truly believe Bitcoin will be worth hundreds of thousands or more, me, I am not so optimistic due to external variables. Thus I do not mine.
