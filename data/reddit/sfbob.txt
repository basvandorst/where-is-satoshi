Thanks very much for the fast responses.  I think I phrased my question poorly.  It comes from reading about differences of opinion re what, if anything should be done about high fees (percent-wise) discouraging bitcoin small transactions in the brick &amp; mortar world.  I gather that the Lightning initiative hopes to address this, but I wonder if there could also be other approaches.
In theory, if some miners were willing to work on blocks of low-fee-only transactions for the good of the Bitcoin ecosystem, could that be done or is “highest bid first” baked into the system?

Parti_zanu, thank you for roughly tripling my understanding with your email.  Here’s my last imposition on this subject:  If a miner wanted to spend the next few days mining blocks with fees below 1000sat/B, would he have to just stare at the screen waiting for “something,” or could he somehow ask for, say, the 1000 transactions with the lowest fee bids that at the very back of the queue.

Coffeinated, I agree that it makes no sense to sacrifice return on investment—unless doing so in the short term could lead to much better returns in the long term.  So, I wonder whether someone who thought that the “Satoshi end” of the market might be really profitable in a few years could find a way to help it grow using the existing platform.

Yes, that’s what I was asking.  Thanks very much for the explanation.  I’m a beginner, and have some work to do on my terminology.  This answer helps.

These answers are very clear and helpful.  Thanks to all.  The Antonopoulos lecture is great.  I strongly second boxhit’s reccomendation of it.
I also watched YouTube tours of two large mining operations (hundreds of SHA256 ASICS).  Are all types of invalid blocks just routinely resolved by each machine without human intervention, or is a knowledgeable person sometimes needed?
