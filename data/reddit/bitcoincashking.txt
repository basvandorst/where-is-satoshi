2 more unlikely authors I would never have guessed at. The first predicted Clinton would be a one term president. The second is the titled father of Jacob Reese-Mogg, a more establishment figure you will not be able to find.
The later did die a couple of years after Satoshi disappeared after a long illness.

Also susceptible to the $5 wrench attack.

Happy to swap

I will demote him immediately. Thanks for your input.

Safe enough for coffee, not safe for lambos.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:37:15
Curious. What were his other scam coins?
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:13:52
I like this argument.

Obviously you cannot give examples of BTC forum censorship here, but do you really believe the 'moderation' on BCH forums are comparable? Please give examples of BCH censorship.
@_date: 2019-11-03 09:40:27
Yes. Localbitcoins have never required blood samples.

We have not seen this good an arbitrage opportunity since just before the collapse of mtGox.
@_date: 2018-10-13 04:35:21
That would be the miners.
@_date: 2018-10-13 04:33:33
I did. Sold quite a substantial amount at the very top 
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:33:34
Nice straw man you have there, but if you do not think there is much change of it collapsing you might want to investigate tether.

There is literally no point in hodling if you do not spend/sell or trade some of it eventually. You cannot eat Math.
@_date: 2019-08-15 22:03:55
Needs more log.

from the ruling:


me does not rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt necessary for a criminal contempt


available under Rule 37 are sufficient, so I exercise my discretion and do not certify facts to Judge
Bloom for civil contempt proceedings.
The ruling is silent about perjury though, so I suspect a prosecutor could begin proceedings.

Why does it need an email address to register?
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:19:57
And yet you write a paragraph on it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:08:28
So that your inheriters will be driven crazy trying to unencrypt your keys?
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:43:33
Except most Bitcoin gambling sites.

The time of Tippet's murder and the time that Oswald left his apartment have been reliably established. There is no way that Oswald could have got to the murder scene without assistance..

We are looking rather suspiciously at tether volumes.

Libra transactions will be harder to reverse. PayPal can reverse it's transactions by saying "breach of t&amp;c". In order to reverse libra, it will have to convince 78 other companies... That might be easy, but not guaranteed. Getting the popcorn ready.

FYI, over 40 witnesses (both at the hospital and the autopsy) reported he had a large wound in the back of his head. The government covered up the autopsy witnesses statements for 20 years.
No witnesses reported a wound where the HSCA said it was in the cowlick area.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:59:55
Yes I do. Thanks
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:25:26
A very bad experience when it did take this long. It will again, by design.
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:29:10
This refers to fiat.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:45:21
Good luck.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:59:26
And it will **probably** get confirmed in the next block as well.
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:13:02
A **new** transaction will **probably** get confirmed in the next block as well.
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:41:01
So potentially weeks then?
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:16:27
Remember that you have coins in the other forks of Bitcoin that will also add up to a sizable amount. Be very careful what software to use and try to keep it all on an offline computer.
As for what to do with it, certainly diversify. Do not keep all your eggs in one basket.

Oddly enough I posted these graphs this time last year and was told to stop fudding.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:52:12
Correction: 4 sats/byte will **probably** get you confirmed next block.

No. He did not. He said it is possible, but [incredibly unlikely]( he was bamboozled.
**edit:** Also in the same article. "I’m still convinced he’s Satoshi despite the really weird proof he’s put in his blog post," says Andresen. He stands by a statement he published on his website this morning: "I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin."

Is not the Genesis block unspendable? Nice story.
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:29:21
He claimed to be "The main part of the team".
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:29:28
Well at least he did not break that rule.
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:04:07
Nice, but I paid over that in BTC fees back in December last year. If you want to hodl BTC you need to hodl a lot more.
