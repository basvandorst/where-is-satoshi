Hasn’t rate cuts traditionally lowered store of value investments like gold (and more recently BTC?)

Not much of a life saving if you are 12 lol

So if you lose your ledger, but have your phone and pass code, how does it actually restore it? Sorry, new to cold storage, just want to figure out how this works
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:39:42
Likely the nano. And as a follow up, can use ledger software to transfer back to coinbase just as easy?
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:50:21
Is that a poke ball?

I was wondering why there was a presumed bull run

He could also just be super rich in a few years. Unless he’s like 12 and out a life savings of $10 dollars from birthday in it

You guys look great. But also, somewhat like a Jonas bros fan club about to try and sneak backstage. And I’ll bet he smells like the ocean.

N00b question, but how do I get BTC off coinbase onto a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-16 03:02:45
What is the app?
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:38:39
Maybe add a moon somewhere on there?

Like the other guys said, RH isn’t really owning crypto. It is making a stake with a bookie. But if you aren’t planning on spending it and just using it as a speculative tool, the. You can do it for 0 fees. But keep in mind that other services have fees of 0.5% or lower (0.5% being what most people get on Coinbase pro)
Also. If it goes to the moon, you can always sell on RH and immediately buy on an exchange for roughly the same amount as well

I agree that I think bitcoin/cryptocurrency will be a long term winner
Given your current responsibilities and financial situation, you are likely in a different boat than others
If you are in school and only have (as an example) between 1-10k and out it all in bitcoin, it is quite different than someone who puts 500k into bitcoin
In the grand scheme of things, even if you lost your entire life savings up to this point, you can recover pretty easily once you get out of school and start earning real money
In that sense, I get what you are doing and don’t think it’s the worst idea, because even if bitcoin goes to $0, you essentially took a gamble and lost a small amount
However, if Bitcoin does become something like 100k-1mil, then you are a genius in retrospect

It seems that you deposited 175, did something with it, used/lost/transferred 25 and are now trying to withdraw. However, it takes 5-10 days sometimes for them to clear from your bank and your original funds aren’t free to be cashed out until it clears.
This is just my best guess, could be totally unhelpful though

Lol this made me chuckle

$5 is a cheap shirt. Everything will e fine. Just pick up an extra shift at the mall

I just meant stylistically lol. They are the same value

I think I like 1btc=100mil more than 1 satosh being 1

The fees are for coinbase pro. Not the app coinbase. 
Coinbase the app already charges crazy high fees but has super easy interface. 
Coinbase pro is only on website, and slightly less friendly ways to buy, but has better analytic tools. 
The fees went from .15% to .5%, so depends on if you can stomach that. 
You can still use coinbase wallet regardless of where you buy from if you transfer to it. 
And I think a lot of people are using kraken or Gemini as next options, but not 100% sure. I don’t execute enough trades for this to effect me that much, I don’t plan on changing anything. HODL lol
