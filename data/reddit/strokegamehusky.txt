Thank you so much Good Samaritan! Explained perfectly. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:41:38
I'm sorry guys, noob here, ELI5?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:37:13
How about the difficulty ? I can't imagine many more miners are adding hash rate when the price is dropping and the hashrate is increasing "dramatically" 
Something has to give, they are in it for profits, not just to prove a point on Reddit 
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:08:17
That's the only factor

If bittrex changed Bitcoin to "butcoin" on its exchange r/bitcoin would be pissed.... 
I follow both subreddits and trust me both are very childish about name calling. It's not good for either community. 
I own both coins, and I think the entire controversy helps no one. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:38:19
Yea it's a crazy idea to have a currency you can use AS a currency... 
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:29:54
To blow right through that foolproof vest
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:42:47
Yet controls interest rates.... hmmm ��

Trust me, I understand the importance of moderation. I wouldn't want the mods to just let people run wild, but I think there needs to be a informed discussion. 
This is their answer to "FUD" I'm sure, but sometimes it's not just FUD, sometimes people have a point, and banned. If something is proved to be false, sure ban them. But much of this is a matter of opinion.

Yea idk what time we had to get it in by but I transferred all my bitcoin 7/31/17 20:55:46
I assume I got it in on time, yet no BCH ... yet? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:23:24
No it's definitely being traded, just shot up to $227
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:40:03
Banning people for a different opinion than you goes against the entire ideology of Reddit 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:14:44
I got it, but took a while
13:39:17 -- transfer went thru 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:49:18
How long have you had ur bitcoin in Kracken? I transferred them on the last day, so I'm assuming they are giving it out to people who have been there the longest first 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:47:52
It was for $30 lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:44:31
Yea it's been around $200-230 for a lil while... still no update on my BCH tho, I still have none
Did I get it transferred in time? 
I don't know when the actual cut off was, or what time zone etc 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:48:05
I mean who needs a wife when you can bang your lambo? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:29:58
That's a lot of waterfalls 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:47:47
As a long time subscriber to both sides and owner of both coins, both subreddits have turned into Cults, banning and removing any different opinions than the respective subs. 
This is bad for both sides Bc there is ZERO informed discussion about the 2 coins. It has turned reddit into a terrible source of information on these coins (at least these 2 subs) Bc of the heavy bias each way. Both coins have pros and cons!

I'm no expert by any means, been watching since ~$.25 bought in  
The "tangle" is a new tech and is very scalable and snappy with transactions. No fees. It's much more complex than that, check out 
r/IOTA 
r/iotamarkets 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:59:21
IOTA ftw 
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:33:22
Genesis is one that I trust. I also use Hastings24 and hasflare. It's been only a few months since purchase and no issues with withdrawal etc.
I starting buying them end of May and I've mined back a tad less than half of what I put in so far. 
I cloud mine BTC, ETH, and XMR
When did you start? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:37:31
Why ban anyone for differing opinion? It just seems shady doesn't matter what side your on 
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:23:33
Weirdos, 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:54:05
Has it paid out more $ than you put in? Or bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:22:13
I used to think it was oprah lol
Basically could be anyone, but there are a few prophesies they have to fulfill, like weird shit
I think one is something about being gored as a child in the ribs, but no broken ribs 
Weird shit like that, the Bible is very odd 
Revelations is the oddest, but badass Bc it talks about the end of the earth 
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:23:50
You realize that is biblical right? One world currency is a sign of the end of days lol 
Also, the anti Christ will pop up around that time 
Revelations, the last book of the Bible 
I'm no bible scholar, just remember this from Sunday school... when I first learned of bitcoin I thought of the book of revelations, and I figured "hey well may as well profit off of it"

"Try harder, shill" 
What a neckbeard ��

All those people who were new to the market during the boom mostly lost money and I bet they never gonna invest in crypto again 
I might, just definitely not bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:42:06
Yup. These people don’t seem to realize how much new $ it would take to push that price to 20k, there are so many people who invested in bitcoin at the peak, that lost all their money that will never invest again. To me, it’s dead. 
I held out and tried to weather the storm but gave up and sold  bc I just didn’t see it returning upward 
I could’ve had much more money if I didn’t listen to the echo chambers, do what you think is right with ur money, this sub is inherently going to give you bad advice Bc they always have an ulterior motive, their own $$ 
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:54:13
I sold everything  
I could’ve sold at a much better price obviously, but I held and held and held thinking it would get better. I listened to a echo chamber that told me to “hodl” no matter what. 
Make up your own mind what to do with your money, get your information from multiple sources, that don’t make a proifit off of you. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:07:54
Where can I bet with bitcoin? I feel like I should know about this by now....
