They don't because that would scare away the major target for these machines. Street level drug dealers with an excess of cash and no legitimate way to claim the money as income use these machines to launder their money. See all of the other comments about the high fees associated with these terminals. No person who already had money in a bank account would use these when their are exchanges doing the same thing for much cheaper.

 Its a terminal for laundering drug money. The fees are so high that anyone with a legitimate source on income would just buy from one of the many legitimate exchanges.

The first 5 are facts. I take issue with the last two.
6). No matter how you feel about the value of the technology you need to acknowledge the underlying volatility. Bitcoin is not a suitable investment for a large number of people.  
7). Gold has several advantages over bitcoin that can make it a superior product to own. Bitcoin is dependent on humanity maintaining a relatively high level of development that we have only reached in recent past. There are several black swan events that could disrupt the underlying infrastructure that bitcoin needs to exist. Gold also has value as a commodity in addition to its value as a store of value and it's relative scarcity.
