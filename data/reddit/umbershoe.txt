People could create a crypto currency that is not allowed to be traded for fiat. Block exchanges from listing it. That way it'll live purely on it's own.
It reminds be of a south park episode when space aliens came and brought "universe dollars". People quickly assigned value to them and divided them up and spent them, only to be told that there is no such thing as "universe dollars". haha.

You only pay tax when you buy low and sell high. 
If you never sell, then there is no tax to be paid. There are no crypto taxes (yet?!).
Ideally cypto is supposed to exist side by side with the fiat system without any bridges. This way, fiat cannot influence crypto in any shape, way or form. However, since we have crypto to fiat exchanges, the bridge exists and the crypto universe is correlated to the fiat one. If crypto was only attainable through mining ot trading strictly for other crypto, then it would be much more pure.

what do you mean by "ANY transaction that happens within the block  chain" ? Moving BTC to / from various addresses ?! Why would that be taxed ? Or is there something that I am missing ?

this is what I have come up with also, in my quest for crypto tax changes. BTC to ETH to BTC is all taxed. arbitrage is all but useless now.

Coinbase will resume BCH - BTC rading on January 17th a 9am pacific. 
Will this allow people to trade their BHC for BTC on CB finally ? Now that crypto to crypto is taxed, it's not that lucrative of a move. Considering the 0 cost basis for BCH.
