agree. 
Ksat or just k, works great too imo. 
You could even use M or mega sat.

This looks really cool. I've been using blockfolio, and their last updated improved my experience a lot. That said there's still a lot of stuff i dislike and so far, you seem to have fixed those issues. 
Do you expect to add more coins to 'track address' feature, and if so, how many, and when?
last question. Does the 'track address' feature support BTC HD wallets ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:05:00
Is this the main net version ?

haven't read the post yet, but it looks like OP got the password as well. I just wanted to point out that you only get 3 tries before the device (ledger) resets itself. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:51:35


My understanding is that when a HD wallet generates a new address, it might be deterministic from the private key owners point of view, but not from anyone who only knows about the public keys. Generating new wallet wont change anything. Sending back to a new address should be enough.
When sending from wasabi to ledger/trezor, you loose a lot of privacy if you combine  all the mixed outputs, so sending individual utxo's back to the ledger/trezor is the way to go.

This sound like a reasonable idea. 
I think lightning is a far better idea for scaling than a blocksize increase, and will help bitcoin become more like a currency. Right now I don't think a lot of the transactions are for traditional purchases, so I don't think lightning will help a lot with the current situation (hope I'm wrong). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:19:54
What's their value proposition? Small fees ? Every altcoin got small fees. Maybe it's having bitcoin in the name.
If the Bitcoin community at large decides to increase the block size to the size of bcash's blocks, then what do they offer, no segwit and lightning? 
I don't think scaling through block size increases is a sustainable path, and my understanding is that, that's what bcash plan to do.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:43:29


Bitcoin Core can't raise the blocksize, the community can. 
I don't think the block size debate is that black and white. I wouldn't be shocked if at least 10-20% would vote for a blocksize increase to 2MB weight, to relieve some pressure until better solutions are available, or exchanges and services prioritizes lower fees. 
It's not 1MB vs 1TB blocks.

I'm pretty sure you can't buy directly from Coinbase. When you buy, you buy from a seller on their exchange (pro.coinbase.com).
I get that the exchange itself could do trading on their platform, but your original post made it sound like people traded directly with the exchange, which isn't how they are set up. Thats all.
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:29:51
I might have misunderstood you, but I don't think exchanges buy/sell bitcoin at all. You don't buy from or sell to the exchange, you trade with other people.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:13:13
How about we use it half as much now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:11:40
If everyone expects it to drop due to the futures, then why have the price increased a lot after the CME announcement ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:36:37
My understanding is that if node A wants to send money to node D, and A have a channel to B and B have a channel to C and C have a channel to D, the transaction can be passed through those channels. 
I don't think each node knows about the chain of transfers, but only the neighbor nodes, so B knows about A and C, but not D.
If this is indeed the case, D would not be able to deny the transaction from A, because D only knows about C.
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:18:16
All the trading is done by users, with Coinbase or any other exchange as the middleman. When I buy 1 bitcoin from Coinbase, they find me a seller I can buy from. They make their money from the trading fee.
If I wan't to sell a bitcoin, I have to transfer it to Coinbase, and when doing so, I loose control of that bitcoin. Coinbase will be in control of that bitcoin, and add my 1 bitcoin to a ledger in their internal database. Whenever some trading happens, that ledger will be updated. No bitcoin is moving anywhere when a trade have been complete, it's all done in their database. Only when someone want to withdraw their bitcoin, from the exchange or deposit to the exchange, do real bitcoin get transfered. 
I hope this makes sense.

yeah. The comment was ment for people who somehow think an upcoming event wont be priced in until the event takes place. I don't expect a fall tomorrow, and looking at the current price, I don't think the market does ether.

I've seen this statement a few times, but is it really true? 
this seems to suggest otherwise, or am i misreading the table, or misunderstanding your statement?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:06:20


You can also set a custom fee!
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:31:42
The table uses these classifications: Currency, Commodity, Property.
When the table says a country classifies Bitcoin as a currency and not a commodity, its incorrect ?

Why would you spend any USD when you could buy BTC which will be worth more tomorrow ?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:42:31


Bought a $500 monitor 16 days ago. payed $0.16 in fees.
It might be worse now, but I feel like you can save a lot, if you just have some patience.

I don't really see the logic in selling you're crypto if tether suddenly crashed. If anything I would withdraw any usd backed stable coin I owned or buy bitcoin with it. 
I image we would see a drop in the broader crypto market of 25-50% but it would be an initial drop based on uncertainty, that would bounce back again. 
On a side note, I find the whole tether FUD kind of silly. Any exchange running a fractional reserve is as problematic as tether doing the same.

I think the last part of your post might confuse newcomers. You make it sound like less hashrate on the network would mean slower blocks, and that the network would grind to a halt if the price dropped, because it wouldn't be profitable to mine anymore. Also, "there will be no fucking chain", doesn't really make sense to me. Even if bitcoin where to 'die', I'm sure a small group of people would keep the chain alive. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:45:36
I'm not sure you understand how mining works. If the hashrate where to double, the network wouldn't be able to handle twice as many transactions, but the network would be more secure. 
If Bitcoin where to increase in price, the incentive to attack it would increase as well. When Bitcoin increase in price, the miners margins increase, and they make more money. When they make more money, new miners pop up (or old ones buy new hardware), which increases the security, and lowers the margins back to, or around, the original level.
I hope this makes sense. I'm a noob, so I might have misunderstood something, but hopefully not. 
Ethereum is working on POS (prove of stake). I think you would enjoy reading about it, if electricity 'waste' is a concern of yours. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:00:06
I agree it was much more impactful, but that doesn't make it the first. I find the headline disingenuous, and by not pointing stuff like that out, the community could be viewed as less trustworthy, and thats a massive issue.

Wasn't litecoin the 2nd or 3rd coin to implement segwit ?
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:32:19
Saying litecoin is a faster version of bitcoin without talking about the trade-offs is kind of misleading though. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:50:51
I'm not really fit to answer that question, but here are some issues. 
By decreasing blocktimes to 2.5 minutes, you increase the chance of blocks being found at the same time and waste 50% of all the hashpower which decrease security. Googeling  orphan block or stale block or uncle block might give you some more technical insights into this.
You also end op with 4 times as much data, so there might be some issues with storage, CPU and block propagation on the network. This could all decrease decentralization.
If litecoin was a better version of bitcoin, I think you would see a lot more people push for lower blocktimes for bitcoin, but you don't. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:36:28
I haven't looked into this, but do we have something that truly proves that the bitcoin they have credited users on their site is backed 1:1 by bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:50:41
Isn't lumping BTC and BCC together asking for trouble ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:59:25
The adjustment period is 2016 blocks, not 14 days.  If a block is found every 10 minutes on average, it will take 14 days to find 2016 blocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:22:35
Thats not what I'm talking about. My point have nothing to do with tether besides the point that it would be far easier for an exchange just to take some of the bitcoin their users have deposited, and the users wouldn't know for a long time, if ever.
When you send a bitcoin to your wallet on bitfinex, they probably send it to some internal cold storage, and then credit your account with one bitcoin (just a number in a database). If we don't know the sum of bitcoin in their wallets, or the sum of bitcoin credited to users (database). Then how do we know they are solvent. Instead of creating Tether, wouldn't it be far easier to just credit their own account with bitcoin (database) if they wanted to scam people?

Is the purpose of miners really to cryptographically verify transactions? I thought that was the job of full nodes. 
"Miners cryptographically verify transactions by spending computing power and electricity"
This doesn't seem right, the computational power required is to ensure an average block time of 10 min.  
I'm just a noob, but I would have though the purpose of miners was to secure the network.

Not sure if it matters, but I'm pretty sure ledger ships their devices from France.

My guess is that Europeans use EUR as an on ramp, but trade using USD.
