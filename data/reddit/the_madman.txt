Bear in mind that those funds won't be used for that one merchant exclusively, but for anyone connected to the graph. The funds are only locked up in that they can't be used on the Bitcoin network off-graph.
Additionally, as I understand it from [here]( the funds won't truly be locked up for years - you will create a time-locked refund transaction off-chain that lasts for weeks or a month or so. Within that time period, the parties can either publish their transactions on the blockchain or create a new off-chain refund transaction that also lasts for weeks. The funds won't truly be locked up for years - you will be able to publish the transactions within that time period to close out the channel, or you can choose to keep the channel open for a longer period of time.
This means you can have effectively months or years worth of transactions within two blockchain transactions without the money *necessarily* being encumbered for that entire time period.

In the meantime, while most people are still considering Bitcoin as a currency to buy coffee with, I'm anticipating it becoming hugely popular as programmable money. We won't just have humans sending money to other humans, we'll also end up with computers sending transactions to other computers, potentially hundreds of times a second.
Scalability isn't just important for human use and it isn't just a case of making the blocks bigger.

It's a peer to peer mining pool. How it works is very fascinating, actually: it uses a smaller blockchain from the Bitcoin blockchain, with lower difficulty (averages out to a block every 10 seconds) to determine how much hashing power is being contributed to the network by each node. When a block in this smaller block-chain is *also* valid for the main Bitcoin block-chain, I.E. the solution found for the easier p2pool blocks is also valid for the more difficult Bitcoin block, the reward is distributed by the Bitcoin network directly to the miners based on the hashing power they contributed. The Bitcoin mining/transactions are, at no point, controlled by a single entity.

Definitely use a third-party payment processor, like many others have suggested. They make it easy to accept as-is or convert into other currencies, and they allow you to set your prices in a currency of your choice and have it converted into Bitcoin on-the-fly. They typically have much better rates than Visa or other payment processors, too.
I would start strictly with online payments at the moment. If you have a website you advertise your hotel on, where customers can book rooms in advance, implement Bitcoin payments there. Using Bitcoin in "real life" is a bit fiddly at the moment, though third-party payment processors can also let you do that.

You don't understand how a double-spend attack works.
With 51% hashing power, a malicious individual can first, send a valid transaction for *x* Bitcoin to an address, then second, mine blocks separately from the network that include a transaction to another address for the same coins, an address they control. Until they publish their own block, nobody can know that a double-spend is occurring. You can wait for 6 confirmations and still have the coins your received taken from you because the malicious individual can then publish their own, longer, blockchain that sends their Bitcoins back to themselves.
This isn't something you can protect merchants or individuals against, it's central to the design of Bitcoin. The entire *point* is that the *majority* of the computing power *controls* the blockchain.

OK, I understand the issue now. However, given that the miners are very much at the behest of fully validating nodes, I think it is very much in the miners' best interests to cater to the majority of users.

It's only a fork if some chain contains features accepted by some nodes/miners and not others. For example, if a block came out today that was over 1 MB in size, and some miners/nodes accepted it while others didn't, that would fork the blockchain.
[The block size limitation is deliberate and the plan is to increase it as necessary while the network grows]( It is not a limitation based on physical properties, it is an artificial limitation to allow the network to grow in a controlled manner.
Thus, if everyone agrees to increase the size limit, a fork will not be produced.

If you're going to count World War II as the first disruptive use of the computer, then the first successful demonstration of Henry Babbage's Analytical Engine - the first automatic, reprogrammable computer - in 1906 roughly fits the timeline.
But no, when I said disruptive, what I meant was moving from "highly specialised to individual fields of science" to "necessary in everyday life", starting when size was no longer a barrier to owning a computer, after the move away from vacuum tubes. Turns out it was longer than 25 years - from 1955 to the end of the 1990s, when computers finally started to be adopted by businesses and consumers for everyday tasks.
My point still stands: 5 years is a relatively short time, even for "disruptive" technology.

This is the issue with small pools: because P2Pool does not solve blocks very often due to having low overall hash rate, they do not payout often. However, because few people are contributing to P2Pool, when they do payout they pay the reward in larger chunks. In order for smaller pools like P2Pool to pay smaller, more regular amounts they need to reach a critical mass.

Not necessarily, at least not on any of the cards I have. My bank cards have a daily withdrawal limit of £200 if I use chip-and-PIN, which is still a lot but not in the thousands, and if I suddenly decide to spend thousands of pounds at once the bank asks questions before releasing the transaction. NFC transactions without using chip-and-PIN are limited to ~~£10~~£20 for exactly the same reason, and easily reverse-able.
At least in the UK, as the banks reduce the security needed to make a transaction they reduce the spending power as well. I would not carry thousands of sterling in cash in my wallet, nor would I carry hundreds of Bitcoin on my phone.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:21:17
Not necessarily. They could continue to hash blocks that contain transactions, ommitting the transactions they want to target for a double-spend until they want to carry out the attack.

The solution in the context of a proof-of-work network is to have all miners subscribed to a single "pool" that has no central authority, and distributes rewards/fees based on computing power contributed. While I believe it would have been better to have something like this built-in to the first Bitcoin mining software (which is that terrible CPU-based miner that ships with the reference client), P2Pool is the closest I think we're going to get to that ideal solution.

I don't fully understand the long-range attack. Are you suggesting that someone that sits on a "reasonable" amount of coins is able to mine one large block with all past transactions?

These are the issues I see with Proof-of-Stake at present, even assuming dishonest mining issues are resolved.
The way Bitcoin is designed, it is possible for companies that store many users' Bitcoins to store them in a single centralised wallet, updating users' account balances internally instead of writing and distributing transactions on the Blockchain. Blockchain transactions are only distributed when a user requests to transfer Bitcoin to an address outside the company's control.
This is a good thing for many reasons, including allowing a company to let users trade among each other in much smaller denominations than the Bitcoin blockchain; it allows the company to act as a trusted entity among users inside it, allowing instant trusted transactions, protection against scams and other similar benefits; and it removes a huge amount of burden from the Bitcoin network for a large class of transactions that do not need to be there. The Bitcoin network can then be used by the users of that company's platform to withdraw Bitcoin, send Bitcoin to an individual not using the company's platform or for an individual not using the company's platform to send Bitcoin to someone who is. I believe Coinbase and other companies (such as gambling websites?) already use a scheme like this.
Not only will companies use platforms like this (we are all already aware of banks and other financial institutions), but it is potentially a good thing, providing services and benefits over the raw Bitcoin protocol.
However, using coin-age for proof-of-stake, this means that potentially, some number of companies have a large amount of coins that technically are unspent for a long period of time, potentially giving them disproportionately large influence over the blockchain. This is made worse by practices such as the use of cold storage for the majority of coins. This makes for an environment where centralisation and collusion is potentially a natural side-effect of the protocol.
In Proof-of-work, even if the production of equipment is centralised, economics dictates it is more cost-effective to sell the equipment than to attempt to build out one or multiple warehouses, attempt to manage heat distribution and energy costs, and so on and so forth. And for buyers of mining equipment, it is cheaper to host mining equipment in a single location than to attempt to distribute it; and then there are physical and economic factors in buying enough energy to scale up the mining operation. At present, at least, the main concern of centralisation in proof-of-work is in pooled mining, where many distributed miners pool their resources together to reduce variance in payout. There are solutions to this issue floating about, some internal to the Bitcoin protocol and others in the form of services external to the protocol. Proof-of-work is never going to be "fully decentralised" - for many users the payoff of mining will be lower than the energy costs - but the barrier-to-entry is relatively low and the cost of fully centralising the process is relatively high.

Having studied proof-of-stake, I have decided I dislike it and don't believe that it is a viable form of consensus.
Secondly, the consensus with Bitcoin lies with both the miners and full nodes. Full nodes do not accept blocks that break the rules. If nodes are not accepting blocks, miners are not making money from transaction fees or block rewards.

The main issue I have with these concepts is that instead of having (hopefully) a single team of security experts managing the security of people's log-in credentials, now every user has to have all machines they plan to use the service with, including potentially laptops and smart-phones, be highly secured. And if the proliferation of botnets is anything to go by, that's not something we can trust.
In many cases, the worst that happens with centrally authorised services is that their database is leaked. So congratulations, attackers now have a list of salted hashes they can attempt to brute-force, which for even just one user's password could potentially take years... meanwhile the service can just force users to change their password on their next log-in and solve the issue in seconds. This is a considerably better situation than if attackers abuse social engineering or arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities to get malicious code onto a large number of users' machines and steal their wallets... or indeed their account passwords, so much so it seems to be a more preferred attack vector than the services themselves.

The main issue I have with a P2Pool-like system is that it seems redundant to have separate chains from the main Bitcoin blockchain to calculate percentage hashing power or shares, when percentage hashing power can be calculated off of the main Bitcoin blockchain itself.
I had considered the possibility of using the main Bitcoin blockchain as a measure of percentage hashing power in the network and dividing the reward across miners proportional to the number of blocks they have solved. This could be built in to the main chain's/client's protocol, reducing the redundancy of having to distribute multiple chains at different intervals. Since full clients download and verify every block since the last "freeze" (can't remember the terminology now), they can also (trivially?) calculate the reward share to distribute so it would be possible to enforce such a scheme by rejecting blocks that do not have correct outputs listed. If variance is the issue we are attempting to solve this appears to solve that issue. It may also encourage people to mine when they are economically able and to stop mining when they are not, as it is a scheme that continues rewarding them for blocks they have mined in the past in incrementally smaller amounts.
However, it only begins distributing rewards to a miner after that miner has mined a single block (which may be discouraging given the current chance to find a block); assuming it doesn't stop rewarding miners that have found blocks in the past, in the worst case it would inflate block headers linearly to the number of blocks found and the storage space required for full block headers exponentially for each block (This is the very worst case and won't be the case in practice, though I'd have to calculate the average increase)(I consider this trivially solvable); as well as others I'm sure I had thought of but have forgotten by now.

A better method, if memory serves, would be to validate all transactions in the blockchain, then remove all spent transactions from storage. This could be tweaked to cope with issues with Bitcoin, such as dangling blocks, by maintaining a certain amount of history for each unspent transaction, either by previous transactions or blocks.

I distinguish between two different kinds of deflation, only one of which I think Keynesians consider bad:
1. The value of Bitcoin against other currencies is increasing because its demand is not saturated yet (by saturated, I mean: everyone that could want to use Bitcoin is using it, and anyone that is not using it doesn't want it - this is what I refer to as speculation: people are holding Bitcoins because they believe the market isn't saturated, thus they will become far more valuable);
2. The value of Bitcoin against products and services is increasing because the production of the economy is growing while the supply of currency is fixed (this is what, if I understand correctly, Keynesians believe is a negative impact, as demand for currency should be maintained below the supply of products and services in order to encourage its exchange against products and services).
I don't believe making arguments about 2. is useful until 1. stops being a factor in the equation. 1. is expected of any new product or service, the fact that it is a "currency" in this case is moot.
*Edit: in response to your edit: I agree completely. The Bitcoin economy is small and immature, and I highly doubt that shops and markets are accepting it due to its merits as a currency. Rather, the value of accepting Bitcoin is in the merits of the protocol over existing solutions. As long as the economy is accepting Bitcoin as a proxy currency for dollars or other fiat currency, though, I don't think it's wise to take current market behaviour and apply that to a "Bitcoin-only" economy.

The amount of hashing power isn't an issue. Bitcoin is designed specifically with that in mind. Even if a majority of the miners decided to change the rules of Bitcoin, if the full Bitcoin nodes were not updated to reflect that then the miners that remain and continue to follow the rules the nodes accept would continue to satisfy the masses and reap the rewards in transaction fees and newly generated coins. 
The miners are very much at the behest of the full nodes, which is why it's important that people, when possible, prefer a fully validating node like the reference client over "light" nodes, which centralise the validation across clients.
I don't understand what role the proof-of-work system fulfils in your system that isn't fulfilled by miners and full nodes combined.

However, there is little advantage to miners using a centralised pool when that pool is then going to connect to P2Pool. Miners receive the same benefits from mining on the P2Pool directly.
The biggest issue I see with making a P2Pool or similarly decentralised pool mandatory is that that decentralised pool can only offer the safe, correct rewards to miners. Centralised pools run by individuals that connect to the decentralised pool can offer unsustainable, short-term, short-sighted rewards that are more enticing to idiots with too much money.

That's not what he said at all.
When you spend a transaction, all the coins are removed from the original address. The amount you wanted to send is sent to the address you specified, and the 'change' is sent to a new address in your existing wallet. That already happens, and has happened by default in Bitcoin core and other clients since the beginning.
Meaning when you next spend your coins, an upgraded wallet can turn the change transaction into a SegWit transaction automatically.
That's all that's being said.

But if miners have their fees set based on recovering the costs of mining, then having the amount paid by the block rewards halved means more of that compensation has to come from the fees.
Considering the eventual plan was to have the reward halved to zero I think it's ridiculous to think the current transaction fees would be enough to offset the cost of mining.

An alternative is to use a random password generator for all your different online services, then store the passwords in an encrypted file which you remember the password for. Alternatively, use a Master Password for your web browser's remembered passwords, it has exactly the same effect.

While that's an interesting aspect, a better way to phrase my question might be, "How much information can some arbitrary entity attach to Bitcoin transactions?"

Just one question - does the Bitcoin protocol *depend* on a single public key encryption algorithm (OpenSSL's ECC), or could you feasibly swap it out for any public key encryption algorithm? I believe new public key encryption algorithms would be necessary for quantum computers, and being able to migrate people's current coins over to a new standard would be nice.

Am I the only person happy about this? Bitcoin's value is becoming more resiliant and the market has very quickly adjusted to the extra supply in Bitcoin. Only months ago, its value went from ~$12 to ~$5, and it took several weeks for the price to reach the high of ~$12 again. Just now the price dropped in one hour from $15 to $10, then the next it raised again to $13. Sudden rises in supply or demand are becoming less damaging to the overall market over time, and if this trend continues Bitcoin's value will become less volatile.
I see promise for Bitcoin's future.

If little happens in the market to disrupt it, Bitcoin's price should continue to increase.
However, many things could happen that would reduce its value considerably, such as an alternative that does better or gains wider adoption or dramatic increase in the difficulty in acquiring Bitcoins, bankruptcy in influential Bitcoin-based businesses etc.
I personally feel like, if a digital currency becomes the de-facto way to make payments in the future, it would most likely be Bitcoin with a tweaked/updated protocol (if necessary to overcome potential limitations), but there's no predicting the future.
@_date: 2012-09-16 21:28:15

Very interesting slides. I couldn't find a video quickly, so I suspect I'm likely missing some context, but it seems complete enough for me.
I've always suspected that, if Bitcoin were to be massively adopted, a similar banking system to the one we have today would rise, not out of the fewer companies/individuals that are able to mine blocks but because buying and selling people's debts is profitable business. I also theorised that, if these "banks" acted the same way with Bitcoin as today's banks have acted with traditional currencies we might end up in very much the same state.
I did disagree with one of his points though, and was happy to see someone else in the comments [here]( agree: I don't believe it's necessarily *everyone* or *just a single entity* that is in charge/has control of the block mining process, but that it might behave more like the internet in that you have a collection of "normal nodes" (smartphones/consumer computers) that all connect to a "super node" that is then networked with a large collection of other "super nodes". This would be necessary to prevent a very small subset of entities from effectively controlling the whole network, I think.
Most of what I'm doing is just studying and thought-experiments. I'm trying not to become disillusioned, but I am incredibly interested.

How many Electron apps solve a problem that wasn't already solved? I don't need a Skype that's slower or more IDEs I need to upgrade my laptop to use.
Maybe this is all old-fashioned, but I still care about power consumption in an age where more and more of my battery-powered devices are getting smaller and smaller. Developers should be racing to sleep, when instead they're just assuming everyone's either got 16GB of RAM or that their app is the only one running.
Edit: also, individual processor cores aren't getting faster, certainly not at the rate they used to. The practice in recent processors has been to pack in more cores, which doesn't linearly increase software performance, or apparently to drop security checks for the sake of benchmarking well... And we've all seen how that's going.

I wouldn't disagree with them - there are clear ways Bitcoin could be improved. One of the strengths of free software is the ability to replace inferior software with a fork, or improve it yourself.
The issue with Bitcoin in that regard is that it has a massive network effect. Everyone's using Bitcoin *because* everyone's using Bitcoin. If a better alternative were to crop up, nobody would use it because nobody is using it.
I think, in that regard, it's pretty tragic.

I agree with your sentiment.
To expand it further: how many times have you, the reader, thought about "investing in Bitcoin"? How many times have you thought about investing Bitcoin in something else, which generates a return-of-investment in Bitcoin?
Which of those sounds more like a currency, and which sounds more like speculation?
If all you ever do is buy dollar-denominated Bitcoin to spend on dollar-denominated goods, you're not using Bitcoin as a currency. You're using dollars in a very round-about way.

They're not actively aggressive towards Bitcoin (and are *technically* accepting it) but it doesn't make sense for them to put a Bitcoin option on their payment screen for a net negative effect on revenue, except from the perspective that you want them to actively promote Bitcoin.

Visa saw slow adoption in the beginning. Credit cards and debit cards saw slow adoption at first, too. Mobile phone payments are now seeing slow adoption.
The problem is not just "users use it", it is also, "merchants accept it". Getting users to use Visa required merchants that accepted it. Getting more merchants to accept it required users to use it. All these payment methods have required early adopters on both sides of the fence to start adopting them before they became successful.
Bitcoin isn't going to suddenly spike to billions of users around the globe for no reason. If it is going to be widely accepted it will be because of a slow, gradual adoption, both by merchants and users, just as it had with credit cards.
Additionally, Visa transfers can be reversed with 100% reliability months after the transfer has been completed. It takes a seriously close-minded person to think Bitcoin, with a *chance* of a double-spend occurring *under very specific circumstances* is not an advantage over that.

I think this kind of person isn't interested in turning their money into another currency just to buy the same things they would have with the original currency. I think a few things need to happen:
1. They need the option to accept wages using Bitcoin. Their company can worry about how their Bitcoin wallet is set up; as long as the user has easy access to it via a phone app or a card of some description, something they're familiar with, there's so many ways to provide a Bitcoin option for wages without kicking up too much of a fuss, or even with the user knowing that it's Bitcoin they're using.
2. A real-life ~~general store~~ product has to exist in their area that takes direct benefit from the way Bitcoins work. An example might be, once the instant-transfers thing is figured out, a grocery store with no checkout: instead, people simply swipe their phone/card/whatever over a payment machine and take the product. Apart from being really cool and futuristic, it removes a massive inconvenience from shopping and demonstrates a strength of Bitcoin that would be far more difficult to do in fiat. Other examples would be smart property, Blockchain contracts and others.
It isn't enough for a Bitcoin economy to just re-do everything we've already got in fiat, because why would Joe Bloggs bother transferring into Bitcoin? It's just another inconvenience.

Two-factor security always wins against any one-factor security, though. That's just common sense.

The problem with fiat currency is the dependence on a central point of failure, and one that has proven it is prone to making mistakes *and* is above the law. Until fiat money has value because of something other than authority (which, in my understanding, defies the definition of fiat), this will remain a problem. I, personally, much prefer a system where the decision-making process is distributed. It's ironic that a Brit is promoting democracy over, say, a dictatorship, empire or monarchy.
I'm not going to argue the economics, since there are people far more intelligent than me that actually know what they're talking about on both sides of the argument. I would much rather just let it play out and see for myself.
If a large Bitcoin economy does take hold, and suffers a deflationary spiral or whatever that term is, and really has to increase the supply to compensate, I'm OK with that. I just want to know that the decision is being made democratically and safely outside the hands of authorities that are essentially gambling.

If Bitcoin lasts 10 years, it'll be doing well as a currency. The Euro has been doing rounds since 1999, and we've all seen how well that's doing.
The difference is, Bitcoin can be changed or forked to become more suitable for the time.
@_date: 2013-03-18 02:52:28
I'm not worried.
Even if we can't agree to increase the resolution of Bitcoin, a fork can be made that exists independently of Bitcoin. We would have two currencies based on the same technology, with a varying conversion rate.
The main problem with this is that it divides the mining pool in half, making it easier to perform double-spend attacks in one currency or the other, but if it is so massively adopted that this becomes a problem I imagine both will have so much computing power behind them in their networks that a reliable double-spend attack would be prohibitively expensive to pull off.

Agreed completely. Bitcoin doesn't just need merchants, it needs to be accepted down the supply chain, so the merchants can pay what is owed down the line.
I like to hope that merchants that accept Bitcoin will try to convince people down the chain to accept it, but so far I've not heard of e.g. Wordpress trying to pay their server-running costs with it, nor Reddit nor any other business yet.
Its low transaction fees will help it get adopted by merchants as a protocol, or a "paypal replacement", but there needs to be at least one complete economy built on it before I can be confident in its current price increase.

For God's sake, stop saying, "intrinsic value". It doesn't mean anything.
Saying Gold has "intrinsic value" because you can make jewellery out of it is absurd. You can make jewellery out of plastic beads and wood, that doesn't give them Gold's "intrinsic value". Using Gold to make electronics isn't much of an improvement - suggesting that Gold's current value reflects its use as a semiconductor and its availability is absurd.
No, you're not "taking" money from other people to make the profit - they're giving it to you, willingly, because they see it as that valuable. Why they feel it is that valuable is a moot point. Whether they will continue to see it as that valuable is also moot. Stop trying to make people feel like they're stealing when they're very clearly not.
There is a great big long Wiki article about blockchain growth that I keep linking to time and time again [here]( There are lots of optimisations yet to be done and, in the end, most users won't experience the negatives of blockchain growth because they don't need to download or store the entire blockchain. My mobile phone client does not download the entire blockchain, and very few people will need to.
People touting instant and fully anonymous transactions with no fees are lying, and very few people actually knowledgeable about Bitcoin do this... exactly. However, these are facts: 1. Compared to a wire bank transfer, which takes anywhere between 3-5 days, Bitcoin's 1 hour verification is really fast; 2. Compared to bank transactions, it is considerably harder to trace who is making what transfer in Bitcoin (and can be made completely anonymous with other technology); and 3. Compared to (in my case) a £6 a month charge, and £30 cost to make a wire transfer, Bitcoin is surprisingly cheap, with international transfers frequently costing less than $0.05. The reason "nerds" like it is because it is technically *better*. This is not a difficult concept to grasp, and is why companies like Bitpay make any money at all.
This is one bubble. Bubbles are to be expected when a commodity's price is allowed to flow freely. However, if you look outside the context of this one bubble, it has still grown in value. Do you really believe it's going to "pop" and fall back to under $5? Do you honestly think that people accepting Bitcoin for their businesses are just going to drop it and go back to Paypal, or Visa? The more popular it gets, the more people are "here to stay". Not everyone is a speculator, you know.

I was about to say, the "can't possibly pay off interest" bit seemed to be a bit stupid, since it makes the assumption that we loan from the bank and are, right there and then, required to pay that back plus interest.
The issue with this logic is that work is considered a form of debt, in that a company is required to pay you for the work you perform, and given the loan interest is expected to be paid within a certain time frame you are expected to have worked for a company which acquires the ability to pay you from whatever it is they sell, or in other words, from consumers that are indebted to the company. Those consumers may work for companies that become indebted to them, etc. etc. etc.
When one takes the whole argument with the perspective that debt is not inherently bad ("Can you lend me your hammer?" --&gt; "Sure, if you buy me a beer" = net positive), it becomes apparent that such a system *can* work. Debt becomes a problem when entities agree to pay interest they can't afford because they are not producing enough value over the given time frame.
I'll probably get downvoted for this comment because this is but I actually think the system is quite ingenious. Given that money itself has no value, and *shouldn't* have value, but should instead represent other things of value, it makes sense to store the money purely as information and to simply increase the money supply when someone promises to generate something of value.
*Edit: I thought I typed this already, but apparently not: when the banks fuck things up with greed and/or incompetence, as has happened recently (I think), then no, this system doesn't work.

People speculate on other currencies too. This will be a problem that's unique to Bitcoin because, unlike other currencies, it has to grow organically. Nations aren't just forcing it on their subjects legally.
What will hopefully, in the future, keep the price steady is a dependency on the price being steady due to its use by supply chains. Note that I didn't say merchants, but entire supply chains from raw materials to consumer.
In the short term, merchants and consumers that will be (and have been) "the first stabilisers" will adopt it as a form of exchanging from currency to currency, internationally: its design makes it much more efficient than banks and other payment processors, allowing businesses to do business cheaper and consumers to spend money easier. This is why companies like Bitpay are successful, and it is also why merchants still use dollar-denominated prices for their products, even when accepting Bitcoin.

I didn't think it was a particularly good argument against deflation because:
1. It seems to assume that the rate of deflation of Bitcoin in a saturated market is equal to today's deflation due to increased adoption;
2. It assumes that buying at 30 Bitcoins and selling at 15 due to deflation is a loss, which is an intuitive notion, but incorrect: the reason the price has gone down is because each coin has more spending power, which means you could theoretically sell items for fewer Bitcoins and still make a "profit", I.E. being able to buy more than he could before.

Law of the land vs. law of the payment providers.

@_date: 2013-04-22 03:19:16
Depends on the number of transactions and the value of Bitcoins. Having 7 transactions per second earn you (the spending-power-equivalent of) $0.05 per transaction will earn you (only) $210 per block you solve (potentially divided among a mining pool), but at Visa's rate of 4,000 transactions per second that becomes $120,000 per mined block.
This, I think, is a good amount of money, even divided among a large pool every 10 minutes, and still provides a very cheap transaction fee compared to the 10% of Paypal or even the ~3% of Visa.

You're right.
I think the reason for the price rise is a sudden increase in demand, but once the demand is saturated, what happens? They either hold them, planning to cash out in some other currency later; or they hold them, hoping to spend them later; or they spend them.
If everyone holds them *in order to* cash out later, then they all decide to cash out (either at once or staggered); demand will plummet, supply will increase; and the value will fall as a result.
Now that we know a lot of people have Bitcoins, we need to give them ways to spend them confidently if they are to retain their value. A cyclical economy needs to develop in order for them to retain their value as a currency.

For those that are interested, there is a page on the wiki describing both why this specific instance is happening, and what bottlenecks could arise in the future:
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:55:36
1. Depending on how you define intrinsic value, Bitcoin has intrinsic value. It is rare and there is a cost to generating it. This is a point I would try to focus on and hammer home: it isn't possible to just get free Bitcoins. They're hard to generate which makes them valuable.
2. Bitcoin is a response to the human error that frequently occurs with the current monetary system, errors that, for example, cause financial crises and threaten entire countries with poverty. It is the closest I have seen to a distributed decision-making process regarding a monetary system. This is a weaker point and is easier to debate, so if you're vested on winning a debate I wouldn't highlight this point, but I thought I would just make you aware.
3. The fact that governments back some other currency (such as US dollars) instead of Bitcoin does not mean Bitcoin *doesn't* have value, it only means those other currencies *do* have value. People NEED Dollars because that's all their government will legally accept. If they bring up government backing, hammer home that *this has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin's value*. Return to point 1.
4. Another point they may attempt to make will be, "Why would anyone use Bitcoin?". At this point, I would look at some of the examples in  and make concise arguments based on these experiences - referencing real businesses that Bitcoin solves real problems for strengthens your argument.
5. They will very likely mention Bitcoin's volatility. One argument you could use, that I would shy away from, is the Dollar's weight-traded volatility -  - as a counter-example to this argument. This requires that you are able to convince people that inter-currency trade value of currencies is not reflective of day-to-day use of the currency, and that once prices are fixed against Bitcoin they are much less likely to fluctuate wildly in that context. This is an easy point to argue against. An alternative point is that its value as a transfer of value between other currencies it provides real-world benefits. You can reference point 4 to demonstrate that companies do not need to be - and indeed, are not - affected by Bitcoin's volatility, but are able to accept transactions faster, cheaper and safer than with the current systems.
Those are just a few that come to mind, might be able to think of more later.

TEM has a couple of advantages for this specific case:
1. Its value is tied to Euros, allowing its value calculations to be simplified;
2. The way it is currently used is such that you can pay half-and-half TEM-to-Euros, effectively doubling the amount people are able to spend without actually increasing the amount of Euros available. EDIT: This rate can actually be set by the trader such that they have enough Euros to pay employers and suppliers, and enough TEM to live off from goods in the market.
This isn't really a different currency, so much as it is the people of Greece printing off "fake" Euros that they can trade among themselves and use to increase their wealth.

This would harm it to a degree, but with the number of businesses starting to accept Bitcoin payments (including Wordpress, Reddit and various website hosts), and the technical possibilities of Bitcoin (including the sheer inability to forge it *and deals made based on it*), I think even in this situation Bitcoin would have enough value left over for it to develop an economy around it.

It was better when Bitcoin was less popular.
People used to talk a lot about the problems Bitcoin solves, the problems that still need to be solved, the programs you could write with it etc.
Now it's all about speculation and price. It's quite a joke. Bitcoin as a currency is boring and subject to the same speculation as any currency. Bitcoin as a protocol is new, exciting and revolutionary.
I want more programmers in this sub building cool things on top of Bitcoin.

Normally in Open Source projects, the democratic decision is usually based on the idea that you can fork, or use a different client with different settings.
However, in Bitcoin, if people want to contest this decision enough people need to do it that the transactions can be distributed across the network to the miners that accept them. Considering each client typically connects to 6+ peers at a time, this could theoretically be achieved with only a fraction of the network. It does still require that people are interested enough in the "cause" to switch clients, though.
Additionally, unless every miner decides against it, such transactions will only have a fraction of the total mining power behind them, meaning they may take longer to validate. Once the first validation is completed and distributed, though, each subsequent transaction should be based on it, unless the block is orphaned or miners deliberately choose not to mine from that block. This is not an entirely democratic decision, as the network votes proportional to the amount of mining power behind each decision, and each miner does not necessarily have an equal vote in this regard.
This won't be a problem until the value of Bitcoin increases enough to reduce the transaction costs enough to make such transactions economical. Those that mine these transactions first will, for a while, have exclusive access to the transaction fees from those transactions. As more miners realise that they are losing out on transactions they could receive fees from, they may start to switch over in a gradual manner. It depends entirely on how common such transactions become at that time, and when they are common, whether the fees will be accepted and profitable for the miners to accept.

I look forward to seeing how they're going to try tracking everyone that's mining Bitcoin in the US, considering I can just download a program and start now if I want. Even better if you buy them from someone outside of the US.
There will always be an underground trade of Bitcoin, because it provides exactly the kind of protection and anonymity you and people like you want. That will always be in demand, even if the demand is relatively marginal.

It is quite hard to explain concisely, especially when put on the ball like that.
I personally would have stated it in an even simpler manner: "There is only one valid way to create a Bitcoin. Any attempt to spend Bitcoin you don't own or create new Bitcoin other than the valid way is rejected by the network. Every coin can be traced back to its creation."
Yeah, the ignorance of the others was annoying, but there are ways to combat that, too.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:14
You can track coins back to purchases on exchanges, which means you can get the identity of the person that bought them on the exchange... but I'm not sure you can trace every identity that you send Bitcoins to.
E.g. I buy Bitcoins off an exchange --&gt; I buy pizza with Bitcoins --&gt; Pizza man buys weed.
It's easy to see that I bought those Bitcoins at that point (as the exchange asks for my I.D), but unless the identity behind the pizza man's Bitcoin address has already been compromised I'm not sure how you would reveal the identity of pizza man.
P.S. No offence to pizza men, you're all delightful and I'm sure you don't smoke weed.
*Edit: I have just considered the case where multiple inputs must be used for one output, and the inputs include potentially already compromised addresses, which can then compromise all transactions made with the "anonymous" address potentially causing a chain reaction of compromises.

They pay nothing to receive Bitcoin. How is that not, "eliminating transfer expenses"? If they choose to keep that money as Bitcoin, they still pay nothing. If they choose to convert it on the fly, they have a choice of many companies, many with very competitive rates compared to accepting a Visa transfer. Not only were you flat-out wrong, but precisely the issue you raised still works out as advantageous over the current system.
Whether or not you need Wifi is entirely dependent on the implementation. It's perfectly reasonable to send a Bitcoin transfer over Bluetooth or NFC, or to create an implementation that uses the Chip 'n' Pin system common in Europe. Current implementations simply use an internet connection exclusively because it's the lowest common denominator.

I've moved house every year for the last ~5 years, sometimes twice in the same year.
This means that I've had to change my address at the bank every year, change my Paypal settings to prove I'm still the same guy and, yes, I really have moved house, and still have to change my address with every merchant I've got my VISA information saved with. My last move was from England to Germany, throwing literally everything into a fit. *I just want to buy games on Steam dammit*.
Compared to all that, buying from the Humble Bundle store with Bitcoin is a breeze. I give you money, you give me game, job done.

Like I said, in the short term sellers are accepting Bitcoin as a method of transferring other currencies with companies such as Bitpay, I.E. they use a dollar-denominated price and do Bitcoin--&gt;Dollar conversion on-the-fly.
In order for the price to stabilise, the merchants' vendors have to start accepting Bitcoin, initially to do the same thing: so instead of the merchants converting on-the-fly, they're paying their suppliers who then convert on-the-fly. Then *their* suppliers start accepting Bitcoin and converting into dollars on-the-fly, so now there are two links in the chain before it's converted. Repeat ad infinitum. Eventually it's the raw material suppliers that are converting from Bitcoin to dollars on-the-fly. Alternatively, they can use Bitcoin to purchase from merchants, or do some mixture of the two.
The price may rise drastically in that time due to the new adoption from suppliers, and thus potentially from other merchants the suppliers supply, but nobody is necessarily hurt by it, depending on the amount of time between paying the suppliers and receiving payment from the customer, or on the amount the price has risen before suppliers start to accept it.
This is still a difficult system to get working, and the volatility still causes issues during this process of adoption, but I am thoroughly convinced that this is currently the best way to create a full Bitcoin-based ecosystem, and if I were in the business of Bitcoin payment processing then this is the strategy I would plan my business decisions around.

Re. 7, I actually thought Bitcoin's main appeal was in areas starting to experiment with mobile payments in the East, as well as people in countries where buying products internationally is difficult because payment providers (PayPal et al) don't support them (Wordpress).

What would go wrong? Where do I start?
Security companies have certain prerequisites for operation. By definition, they need to be able to keep their clients secure, otherwise nobody will pay for their service. Thus, they need the equipment necessary to implement security. The best security efforts would likely turn to companies that already produce this equipment cheaply, and whoever can afford the most of the best equipment now can provide the best security, driving out competition. It would also be very easy for the richest current security firm to sabotage other security companies - if this is the only law in town, who will prosecute them? Any attempt by other companies would result in, best case, an arms race, and worst case, a war. In the best case scenario, you end up with an oligopoly, where everyone relies on a small number of companies for security. You can't just decide to start up a new security firm without the funds and a guaranteed supplier. This would make it very easy for them to conspire together, especially when the alternative is a potentially expensive war. An argument against this might be that they would prefer to come to peaceful agreements between them to prevent such large expenses, but ultimately the decision will be made in favour of what is most profitable, not what is in favour of the general public. In the worst case scenario, the result is a monopoly, where the law is a single company.
Public services under a democratic government have decisions made based on what will provide the ruling party(ies) the most votes. In governments that are not based on completely stupid voting systems, where small-but-popular views and parties are not killed in the crib but are allowed to be represented such as under the Proportional Representation voting system, there is the threat that unpopular decisions will be used against them during electoral campaigns, giving the masses some power over the decisions made by those in power. Private companies, who are a law unto themselves (and are, in fact, *the law*) are motivated by profit. If it is more profitable to extort money from the public by force than it is to occasionally have to shoot some of them, that is what they will do. If it is more profitable to accept cash from other large corporations than it is to enforce the law fairly to all citizens regardless of stature, that is what they will do. What recourse does the public have against such acts? The competition? See above. If it is more profitable for the strongest competition to turn a blind eye than it is to essentially wage war, that is what they will do.
Thus, you have a state where the law is decided by the few in power. The only difference this has to a democracy is that, in a democracy, the public have *some* power over the situation, whereas in a privatised security solution the power is all in the hands of the few with the most firepower at their disposal. You'd be replacing democracy with an empire, where the emperor is profit, and if decades of anti-competitive practice cases has taught us anything, it's that money doesn't care about our understanding of morals. It's naive to think that an anarchistic system like this wouldn't result in an authority at least as oppressive as the authority we have today.

You touched lightly on this in your post, but it deserves more attention.
You mentioned that a currency with a static cap becomes deflationary given the assumption that the economy in which it operates becomes more productive over time. I think it's worth mentioning that a currency like Bitcoin *only* becomes deflationary when an economy becomes more productive over time, as it implies that the opposite is true - if an economy is less productive, the currency inflates. This is important as it becomes a self-regulating rule that people are encouraged to spend when and only when the economy becomes less productive, which itself helps to stimulate the economy.
This provides a much nicer model than the current inflationary model of "you must spend all your money and more all the time".

It makes it an obligation for the browsers to support it. Currently, this works because browsers support operating system services for URLs. This can mean that it can perform poorly (for example, Firefox on Fedora fails to open the URL in bitcoin-qt correctly if bitcoin-qt is already running).

In this case, the way those input transactions are being redeemed is the only valid way to do it. If you have 3 Bitcoins which come from several 5mBTC transactions, you must reference every single 5mBTC transaction that the 3 Bitcoins are coming from. See  As you can see [here]( every input transaction is unique. Thus, in order to "create" a single transaction that references all these transactions as one value, you'd still have to lump all these transactions into the blockchain.
The good news is, the *next* time you want to reference those 3 Bitcoins, you only have to do it in one transaction.

The more blocks are generated, the less likely it is that the blockchain will fork (I.E. someone else will publish a chain 2 blocks long that does not include the first block that includes the transaction).
After 6, it is considered "well and truly irreversible". I'd have to pull up a bunch of blockchain statistics to figure out how likely it is for one block to be part of a fork, but lazy.

This does nothing to address my point of oligopolies. Unless that jibberish that was your second sentence is supposed to address that.




The primary reason we don't see security and police departments that range larger than city size is because the government already has a monopoly on security across the country (no, seriously - it is required *by law* to pay the government for the upkeep of public police departments, giving them the majority market share). All you're suggesting is moving the monopoly to a profit-driven business.
When we make the assumptions that 1. the first firms to enter the market literally have the power to set the law, and 2. markets naturally trend towards an oligopoly over time, there is no reason to believe that smaller specialised firms will not be bought or otherwise forced out of the market. Frequently, the arbiter of anti-competitive practices is not the largest corporation, but the government. Now we're suggesting making the largest corporation enforcers of the law, essentially putting them in the position of the government.


Their *best-paying* customer base. Who will that be?


Again, as markets naturally trend towards oligopolies, I highly doubt that there would even be 5 other security organisations available to pick from. We've not seen massive improvements in America's phone services or ISPs - why should we believe that law enforcement would be any better?
Don't underestimate how low people will devolve if given the opportunity, whether large corporation or insignificant individuals. Given the choice, a huge number of people chose to, say, kill thousands of American innocents with suicide bombs, cause the London riots or, in free markets, collude against smaller competition to drop their share price or force them into bankruptcy. This is where the naivety stems from - you underestimate the size of the populace that, given the chance, would abuse the system, as well as just how high up in the system they are.


Who enforces the law against forcing laws on others? Who enforces the law upon them? Assuming this will "just happen" is, again, naive. Assuming that the man is omniscient and selfless, an Empire is a perfect form of government.

It doesn't take ten minutes. Double-spending is already an expensive process and the risk of double-spends can be minimised or made incredibly expensive even with zero confirmations. Double-spends are only a legitimate risk in high-expense transactions for large-ticket items.

Not that I think that's what's happening here - I think the interest will peter out should a large portion of the people brought in by the current interest lose interest, due to the lack of products and services available - but I can imagine that some huge amount of growth in a short period of time may actually be a natural result of such a snowball effect.

Ah, I didn't know the client certificate contained a private key.

So now that the price has halved in about the amount of time it always has in the past, can we go back to posting about novel applications of the technology and protocol instead of obsessing over how rich we all are?

Fuck it, I've closed my PayPal account. Not even in response to this particular case, but to some other news on Reddit. It's like they're becoming more frequent.

Governments could. That comes with the Bitcoin protocol being open-source - they can adopt what they like and drop the rest.

On the other hand, thank you for making my day.

I feel like the people that actually understand Bitcoin and understand what it is about Bitcoin that makes it appealing are not going around pushing people into getting it, because they also understand the average person doesn't have much benefit to gain from it *yet*.
It's not that we're not telling people about it, or don't own any or aren't invested in its success, it's just that we are giving people good, honest advice. We're helping people not by forcing them to buy some, but by making sure that, when they find out that "Paypal accepting Bitcoin NOW!", people actually understand the message and its significance. Maybe then, they can make an *educated decision on their own* as to whether Bitcoin is beneficial to them or not.

Basically, yes. However, there are significant weaknesses to using tomatoes and shoelace as money. Tomatoes are not fungible; they deteriorate over time. Shoelaces are easy to produce and not rare. Ditto for coke cans. These don't make them, "not money" - they just don't make them desirable money, so people don't use it as money, so they're not money.
Bitcoin is desirable money, people are using it as money, hence, it is money.
