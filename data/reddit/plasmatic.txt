Libertarian principles still have a form of accountability. I originally said people, but I think my though processes has lead me to accountability. Time for a quick edit.
Edit: Maybe People who are not held accountable? That's my problem with it.

Excellent comment!

I'm not saying it's the shittiest currency system (I'm still trading in it). I think it has some problems that need to be solved.

I like the relational = operator you used there lol
@_date: 2011-08-03 16:09:47
And now agreed.

I guess you got lucky with mybitcoin lol
@_date: 2011-08-04 22:15:54
Hadn't thought things through. Problem solved now.

Yes I almost agree, but there seems to be absolutely no accountability with bitcoin and I believe the general population lacks the computer knowledge for bitcoin to be a safe currency to use... That is where my fear currently lies :/
I realise other currencies have thefts like crazy, but I believe the publicity that is generated each time some bitcoin is stolen effects the market way too much (This is an assumption from observation of the value of bitcoin. It seems to drop everytime a major event happens)

Good point and I agree. My trust is still at a low point until these things are worked out.

I think the anonymous nature of it is the untrustworthy part. Not the decentralised nature -_-

I've lost faith in it. Still trying to rack up some bucks though :) 
Managed to sell and lose nothing in this recent dip. We'll see how things continue.

I actually didn't lose anything in the recent drop in value. My concerns are more about the recent happenings when I check things on google news or twitter.
Good point that bitcoin is not the issue but rather the services that run on top of it.

Being a Libertarian is not being an Anarchist. I believe the market can handle itself, but I have an extremely small amount of trust in the technical skills of people who develop applications for bitcoin (not the bitcoin application, applications for bitcoin). I never said that I was against the decentralised nature.
@_date: 2011-08-04 16:02:46
Agreed. The decentralized nature is a good one and I guess you can't really have that without being anonymous as well :/

I'm not saying government should jump into and control this thing! I'm saying that the anonymous nature of the currency holds absolutely no accountability for wrongdoing. In a libertarian government, people are still punished for committing acts against other such as stealing property and murder.
Unfortunately the anonymity seems vital for this currency to function as you need that protection from government.
