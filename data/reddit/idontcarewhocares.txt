Good question I feel like this sub should have a FAQ with links to 'how-to' and products such as wallets (both physical and digital). How to convert btc to use, etc.
I also would like to know how to get my btc out of CB.
And, is there a faster way to get $1000-$5000 into an account to buy more BTC then CB And the few business days it takes to transfer in?

Don't be a follower. Make your own assessment. If we were psychics we'd know the future. 
You just scared looking in from the outside. We can't convince you to do anything but you can read all the negative news you want to enforce yourself from NOT buying now.
Don't expect anyone here to talk you into buying btc. Those of us that are in, don't need to waste time selling you on why.

Is website a WordPress site? I believe Woocommerce allows you to accept payments in btc

How do you transfer it to gdax? What's the ideal site to buy/sell with low fees? I know CB is considered high regarding fees. 
I already bought via CB but if I want to buy more after the NY I'd like to buy consistently through a source with low fees.

I have coinbase but I'm currently stuck on how to transfer my btc out of CB into Gemini... Can anyone provide me the instructions for that? I want to leave CB as well!
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:55:40
Exactly! I was debating on purchasing a btc ATM but was curious as to who'd use it or I don't want to end up wasting my money. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:25:22
Thanks for the heads up!!!
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:23:19
I dipped in last night around the $3,100 marker. No regrets. 
Plan on dipping again if it drops to $2,999.

You don't like ARK?
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:44:56
Is there a start and end to a day? Any particular time zone?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:31:45
Wow thanks for the speedy reply! So I just want to confirm I got this...
I just finished opening an account with Coinbase and verified with my phone number.
Now I'll open an account with GDAX on their site and buy through there.
So I use coinbase to monitor the market? Or will my GDAX purchase display in Coinbase? 
Sorry man I'm a newbie but iveen following for a while waiting for a chance to jump in. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:37:31
Thank you will buy some ARK (Thinking $50-$100 worth) and hodl it while I do more research on ARK.

Is coinbase a good company to buy BTC from? I want to invest unfortunately I only have a few hundred to spend.

Chase doesn't offer that service yet 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:24:31
Thank you for the tip! I am on the cusp of doing that (plan on spending few hundred, that's all I can afford!!), But u/spooklordpoo comment concerned me that this proccess will take 9 days to do. I don't want to miss out on the window. Your thoughts?

Crypto is ded

The more familiar people are with it, the more people accept it, the more people begin to use it, the more the value goes up.

Isn't coinbase a wallet? I bought btc through it and it seems like I can sell through and transfer to bank as well. 
Is coinbase not ideal btc wallet?

So I hate to sound like a total rook but I was on the verge of paying to get btc and fell upon this thread. 
Coinbase = fastest way to get USD into BTC 3 days transfer to CB
Bank (mine is chase) = 9 days to proccess into CB

Good on you for waiting to invest your $60 rather then buy a video game. In the long run you'll be happy with your choice!
For now just watch the value of one BTC. Ideally you want to "buy low, sell high" but with BTC I'd suggest "buy low, hodl". With $60 it's not much so it's great to buy and leave it, for now monitor the value of one BTC, wait for there to be a dip, BTC value changes 24/7, clearly it's very aggressive market. 
Personally I'm waiting for there to be a dip around $2,900 - $3,200 to buy more but again that kind of drop will make many people unhappy. 
Good luck!

That is exactly why I asked. Charts and the "1 day" - "1 week" etc which lead me to wonder when the beginning and end of the day was.

So if btc ATM are bad, why are they around? Wouldn't the btc community know not to use it?
