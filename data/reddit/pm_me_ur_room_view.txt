Core devs are not short on money, the difficulties that LN is facing can't be solved by throwing money at it

Right? I mean at this point just use fiat all the way, why bother with the hassle of buying and selling bitcoin if your goal is to use it to pay for credit card.

This art specialization is ... oddly specific ...
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:24:53
there is more to life than money, that much I am sure of
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:01:56
Oh I see that now

Let me just remove my heart rate monitor watch so it charges,... Oops

What happens when people "loss" their btc? Does it get stuck in limbo forever? In fiat, it's irrelevant Cuz they can always print more, but with crypto its limited supply

Depends on how many coins he invested back in 2011? If it's 1 or 2 coins then it's definitely not millions

Cex.io... Brutal verification process though

What do you use for prices alert? I would like to have an alert when a crypto currency price drops / raises by a certain percentage

Can you link to the buy wall? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:50:37
How tho, it didn't even reach that high 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:56:07


Wat?

I am not too surprised tbh, coinmama is based in Israel, an  apartheid state that likes to police and control everything around it. 
Shuffle your coins and never use them again.

I totally agree with you 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:29:05
I agree, but am sure some form of a crypto currency
Will disrupt banks, with fast transaction time and low TX fees. Not bitcoin in its current state though 
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:57:44
If there was *only* bitcoin as a crypto currency then sure, but you have to remember that there are hundreds of other crypto currencies (shit coins or not) with limited supply just like bitcoin.
So really, bitcoin is not unique in having a limited supply.
