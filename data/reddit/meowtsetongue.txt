Do you respond by showing her the long green candle?

None of those things will get people to invest; they don’t know or ever need to know.
We just need market psychology - lots of people to go nuts and invest in a frenzy that starts massive FOMO

cool good to know, so maybe something similar for the next fork.
Do we know what the name of the coin will be called?

what's a good software wallet to use? I liked Loafwallet but it doesn't support bitcoin right

Sorry kinda new - any advice?

Did they mention that somewhere? This is what I was curious about.
Are there two possible opportunities here to get coins - with BTG and Segwit2x?

Technically though, Coinbase could decide to give everyone the extra coins like they ultimately decided for BCH, right?

I love the name dig dug btw. taking it back old school!
So if a hack occurs, doesn't Coinbase offer protection against that? I remember reading if they get hacked, or an employee does some nefarious stuff, etc, they offer protection against your coins (at least for what's in cold storage). They have a small % of your stack "live", as it were, as well. I don't think that's protected but the other assets are. 
In addition, if there are any hacks with USD, you are FDIC insured, right?

Guess who pays for this?
We do, over time through inflation, our hard-earned money’s value decreases and our purchasing power is reduced. We can’t feel it sharply but there it is. Our savings and 401k and retirement money is no longer worth what it was. Instead of needing 1-2m to retire we now will need 2-3m because of this. 
Fractional reserve banking kills. The star that burns twice as bright burns half as long. 
Unless you can get a moderate pay raise every year, your money is literally weaker and weaker because of this fake money being printed.
Scary stuff!
