I'm confused how California would have any legal authority to regulate digital currency transactions, if the federal government, and judicial precedence do not recognize bitcoin as legal currency?

Used to work in banking and wire transfers (especially internationally) are extremely delicate. Misspellings, changing exchange rates, politics, police, or just bank risk adversity, can all slow down or even cancel a transaction. 
But hey, that's why we are all moving to bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:58
Exactly! It's a user design issue. Credit cards work because they are easy - swipe, sign, done. People are willing to give up control, pay high fees, and reduce security for speed and ease. 
Right now people use the same password for everything, they don't change passwords ever, and they share PIN numbers. It's a steep learning curve to make the jump to 12 word seeds, and working with money to the 8th decimal. It's intimidating, complicated, and difficult to learn.

I agree and appreciate the accuracy and finality of that. But from a user perspective, this is intimidating. Many people will have difficulty with this. A lot of bitcoin WILL be lost over the next few years- the learning curve is high. This will cause the existing, active coin to increase in value. However,  I think it will also stall adoption and acceptance. 
I have trouble discussing 1 bitcoin and 0.00000001 to people, and they have trouble understanding it. It is far easier to understand 100,000,000 and 1 Satoshi, especially if a diminishing pool will require adding even more decimal places in the future. 
I just think that these are limitations that the bitcoin community will need to begin looking at in upcoming years - probably sooner rather than later. The risk I believe is if user issues are not addressed, people will increasingly turn to exchanges to manage and control bitcoin which could undermine the actual goals of crypto.

I feel like critics who make the claims of Bitcoin bubbles are failing to understand the basic tenants of cryptocurrency: it's not a commodity. It is a currency that is more secure than government backed fiat. 
Yes, there are a lot of people speculating, and only looking at the growth in relation to its exchange rate. But they aren't accounting for the fact that bitcoin exists and has value independent of any monetary entity. 
Right, now we talk about ATH's and Bitcoins relation to standard currencies. But the intention is to eliminate national currencies, eliminate bank and government tampering, eliminate geo-politics, and create money for people rather than control.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:15:25
I agree. However, I think that the current unforgiving nature of the system, while secure, will turn out to be incompatible with human nature. Arithmetic errors will be made, seeds will be lost, coins will be stolen. Right now, most adoptees understand and appreciate these risks, however for mass adoption to take place, the general public will probably need some forgiveness- another way to reclaim lost wallets, a way to reverse or amend quantity errors, and a way to recover funds from theft.

What a hack job of an article. No attempt to do basic research on the subject.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:19:23
Sorry, yes my mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:59:55
Right, but doesn't this get really inefficient? Especially to write or to reference since we don't have common words for these minuscule fractions? 
I saw a post earlier which suggested a decimal shift to the left, redefining 1 Satoshi as the whole unit of measure. Basically similar to stock split. This would devalue Bitcoin by the same shift, but keep everyone at their current wealth level.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:40
I think you'll find it's very difficult to change human nature, and I think the affects of Bitcoin are going to have huge impacts within our children's generation. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:07:16
Yeah, I get that, but it seems really inefficient to abandon ghost coins. Yes, it's accurate, but it has great potential to deplete the pool. Additionally, as more people adopt Bitcoin without a full understanding, I think this will be a serious barrier to mass adoption. People will lose their seeds, and they will lose a lot of money. Which could really turn people away. 
I think the dev teams will have to find ways to build some forgiveness into the systems for a certain amount of human error. I don't have an idea for this, but I think it's a problem that will need to be worked out.

Your math is incorrect.
You say 26.7% of all contributions, but you only counted contributions of Top 10 posters. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:16:53
How many total commits are there? How many total contributors?
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:24:17
Exactly, so the entire wealth of the world can not exceed 21million Bitcoin. It just divides until there is a smaller standard unit, usable to everyone in the economy? Correct?
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:37:41
I didn’t say you sell the house, said the assessed value of the home is B13. This added value is figured into the measure of your wealth- but just because the perceived value of your home increased does not mean any additional coins were created. Or do we just cut all coins that much finer to increase the total value by B3?
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:32:22
That's fine, but your finding at the bottom is still incorrect. It is not 26.7% of total contributions.
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:48:15

Fiat is not limited, and the current measure of wealth in the US far exceeds the amount of dollars in circulation.
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:00:42
I think the missing key in fully realizing Bitcoin’s power is making internet access open and free. The internet still only exists under local restrictions, which governments and corporations continue to tighten in the name of controlling power and wealth. 
Just like saying whoever has the key controls the coins; whoever owns the connection controls the access. You can only use the coins while you are allowed access.  If someone else owns the access, are you really free?
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:33:03
In a world of limited currency though, the total wealth cannot exceed the limits of the currency.
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:39:39
But with Bitcoin you can only account for what is in the ledger. If it’s not on the ledger- it doesn’t exist.
Your last statement about currency in circulation not needing to exist is what defines fiat currency: it is not backed by anything of real value. It is government issued promissory notes. 
Bitcoin however, is backed by proof of work. So, how can you assign economic value in terms of Bitcoin, if it’s basic proof of work has not been fulfilled? 
Rather I see this as an argument that Bitcoin, instead of being used as an everyday currency, would be more suited to being the backing of currency, like gold used to be. 
is this correct? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:04:42
Ok, that makes sense, and I understand this.
But let’s pretend it’s 2050, and Bitcoin has replaced the US dollar. The US government releases a budget, and it says that the cost for the next fiscal year is B25 million; more than all possible bitcoin.
Bitcoin, unlike a dollar can’t exist as an abstract; only real, created Bitcoin on the chain can be accounted or spent. 
At that moment, does all Bitcoin instantly jump in value to cover the difference? Or does something else happen? How would prices stabilize from day to day? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:21:23
Thanks, I do understand this, but what confuses me I think is how would bitcoin ever stabilize in value? 
Everyday, workers produce products and services which add real value to an economy. I think the current increase is between 2 and 3% annually. This is real value created, not inflation. 
If the wealth is increasing, how do you measure it at any moment, if the value of your measure is constantly increasing and being divided? 
Would our standard measure cease to be Bitcoin, but rather a minute fraction of Bitcoin? This seems to be the argument in your last paragraph, which goes to my original question- would the entire worlds wealth be described as a total of 21 million Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-15 06:01:06
Thanks for being that asshole that walks into the conversation slinging insults. 
I don’t know the difference between Austrian or Keynesian Econ. I’m asking a serious question based on my own understanding of economics. If you have a constructive answer to help me understand what you’re talking about, please enlighten me. Otherwise, kick rocks.
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:50:30
Thank you, I understand this and your answer is well thought out. 
Does this then  support my original hypothesis that all the worlds wealth would thus be described as having a total value of 21 million Bitcoin? 
The problem with fiat currency is primarily that it is unbacked, it is promissory notes from the government, with no accounting of any real wealth or value to support it.
Bitcoin is backed by proof of work. So how do say something has a value of X Bitcoin, is X Bitcoin cannot be created. The only answer would be that all Bitcoin must be further divided until the value of X can be satisfied.

Then how does real estate investment, or rising home prices increase wealth? I understand some of it is inflation, but most of it is supply and demand: the house has an increased value due to a higher demand for local real estate.
I guess my question and concern is what happens if Bitcoin becomes the measure of wealth, and these measures exceed the total bitcoin available? 
At some point, you would either need more Bitcoin, or fractions of Bitcoin would need to become the standard of wealth, just to express how to pay for or purchase items.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:38
I don't think it is nonsense. I understand and agree with you about getting away from oppressive monetary products. What I'm arguing is essentially a user design issue. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is great- it's secure, accurate, and decentralized. However, it is not "user friendly," and for mass adoption to take place, it needs to be easy to use, easy to secure, and easy to manage.
We see this taking place right now with new users coming in through exchanges which simplify the process, manage wallets, and provide user friendly apps and dashboards with poor customer service, poor education or explanations, and high fees. In a search for simplicity, people are willing to give up their security, anonymity, and control to the exchanges.

It's because you're purchasing using a debit card. For whatever reason Coinbase processes debit payments out of country. When I used Coinbase, I set up account transfers. I would wait a few days for the transaction to clear, but skipped the ITF.

I took the survey. I agree with some of the constructive feedback above:
1) the term secrecy is a bit loaded. Should replace with privacy.
2) to the question of bitcoin being a currency or asset, please include options for both or neither.
3) question about limited quantity in a currency centrally controlled is meaningless. As one person or organization controls the entirety of the currency, the rarity, or quantity circulated could change to suit the needs of those in control.

As a former Personal Banker at Wells Fargo: Why waste your time? 
A personal Banker at Wells Fargo only earns about $12-15/hour. They have very little training about financial products. Most of their training comes in the form of high-pressure sales techniques. And their only goal is to open as many bank accounts and credit/loan lines as possible as they have very difficult sales quotas to reach their commissions. 
 
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:31:32
yeah, they don't teach the tellers how to handle these anymore. Only the managers really have enough knowledge or experience to deal with them, and most of them still need to call their main offices for guidance on how to handle them.

Just moved all my coins off Coinbase. Really unhappy about having to give personal information, that wasn't required before.

Just to move it. Asked for address, occupation, employer, etc. Also charged a fee even though I was only moving to hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:28:48
Honestly, the bank is probably pushing brokerage account products on all their tellers, so s/he is putting his sales energy there. Either that, or it is a product s/he is very knowledgable about this specific product, and found a way that s/he can increase their commission through it. 
Over the two years I worked there, I couldn't justify opening a single account for myself or my family as the WF products were mostly pretty bad.
