All websites and news outlets in Cyprus are reporting that staff have not been payed and are in the dark just like everyone else. 
That been said Cypriot media isn't always the most reliable but this is widely reported today and is the main topic on all news sites.
People are even making fun of the massive "Who is Neo?" advertising campaign they used to build Bitcoin and brand awareness, but now they are asking "Where is Neo?"

Thanks for the great summary. Just a quick note, I know this is a totally minor and insignificant detail but its Cypriot not Cypriotic :)
As a Cypriot myself reading through the summary and seeing Cypriotic all over is like having someone dragging their nails on a blackboard while writing on it.

I am not a lawyer but the way I see it the police in Cyprus haven't charged Danny with anything related to Neo &amp; Bee. They have charged him with fraud based on sales of Bitcoins he personally made.
According to Danny's post (If that is to be believed) the total amount he owes to these individuals is 75.29270138 Btc which is a little over $36k as of now. If Danny resolves this issue with said individuals the police case will most likely be closed.
If the amount of missing Bitcoins is about 5000 as reported ( I personally think that its more than that since there is zero accountability when it comes to money spent by Neo &amp; Bee) after paying off his personal debts he is still left with 4925 Btc and no criminal charges.
I doubt there will be any further criminal charges in the case as any creditors owed money by Neo &amp; Bee are unsecured creditors owed money by a limited company. Sure they will probably go to court but at the rate those kind of cases go through the court systems here plus the massive backlog of such cases due to the bad shape of the economy in Cyprus right now, it will be years before anything comes of it

How about posting again and actually saying something, anything actually, about what is going on with Neo &amp; Bee?
All I see is you trying to defend your personal purchase of a Bentley and explaining agreements you made with individuals to sell Bitcoins to them that took place before Neo &amp; Bee.
