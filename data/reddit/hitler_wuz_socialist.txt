It's not too late to redo your taxes for past years if you didn't include capital losses. A 3k per year tax deduction is better than nothing especially when you dropped all your savings on a shitty investment move.

Must be great to hope for socialism so failures have a chance

By the nature of how bids and asks work you are going to be in a small net loss from a get go. Then if you're trying to time the market you're up against billionaires with their coders who have had decades to have a leg up on regular schmoes like us. 
Every time you're thinking of making a short term profit just call yourself a brave dummy for going up against all the stacked odds against you.
That's why good investment advice has always been to buy and hold longterm with a diversified portfolio.

I don't think them or you realise that the president has no say in the matter.

Lol by that logic most venmo users would be flagged and in jail. The majority of posts I see are joke descriptions like 'blowjob' or 'being sexy'. What you write doesn't mean anything

You determine which coins you are "selling"... If your exchange doesn't let you choose then there's your problem.

That's because such a place cannot exist legally and service US customers. Those companies don't give a fuck about your information because it is expensive to store and protect. And they are liable for what happens if there is a breach.
The us govt requires them to collect it though, so that's why.

Say that to nvda who was leagues ahead and tanked bc it missed some arbitrary goal posts. Choosing individual stocks is luck and little more.

Bernie isn't a moderate. he wants full on socialism which is as far left as you can get.

For real. I am just waiting for the next crash so I can buy a house. No point in buying at what I assume is the top of the market.

I've never seen a queue for an ATM either...
I'd imagine most buyers do it online.
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:35:59
That spread... Wtf
If btc atm fees are this ass then they're not even worth using.

Last chance to realize why there are regulations for other securities and laws against "currency" manipulation

I think it's worth garbage but I managed to snag some at 4k so I'm holding until I buy a house or it drops back down to that level
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:05:07
Their point is pretty much meaningless since most people don't use btc to actually buy stuff and most people don't hold their own coins anyways due to technical incompetence or being smart enough to realize that storing them yourself on a sufficient number of backups is a pain in the ass and only makes them easier to steal. 
Tl;Dr holding your own coins is currently not worth the hassle. If you really wanted to be "safe" you'd probably be best off spreading your coins out over different exchanges.

The most successful investors according to Fidelity are those who were found to be dead or those who forgot they had accounts.

Isn't it assumed it was all wash selling and immediately buying back in?
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:44:51
Is there any benefit (to myself) for setting this up
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:19:32
What are fees like for buying small amounts?
