There is no reason for me to lie. And I’m holding btc.

It put Coinbase inc when making the wire transfer. I think the manager knew that I was buying btc. I bought btc directly from coinbase couple of times ago and they tried to call me to warn (it was back in January).

Well, considering I didn’t use my debit card to buy anything, I just used it to pay the bill regularly for that past 6 years, what else is unusual activity except the recent Gdax deposit?

That’s the closest bank to me in my town. The second closest is BoA, which is also known for being against BTC. Sure, I need to find another one asap

Nope. I just use them to pay my bills. Never make online purchases directly with my debit card

It’s the only unusual activity as I record. I don’t use my debit card for online or in store purchases. Just my bills for the past 6 years.

I called them and they said they flagged my account for unusual activities (a deposit to gdax weeks ago).

Yes. I’d been in business with them for 6 years. I made a deposit to GDAX last month. Last week, I found out I could no longer log in to my online account nor use my debit card, I suspected this would happen

That’s good to hear. I’m going to open an account with them tomorrow then :)

Btc is legal here in America

You can read my other comment. I’d been with them for 6 years. They closed my account weeks after I made a deposit to GDAX through them.
