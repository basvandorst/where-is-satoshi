Oh, c'mon. I'm a software developer (and "web developer", sadly...) too. These days, you're almost guaranteed to screw *something* up. A list of things that any "competent" web developer has to know about, just off the top of my head:
* Applied cryptography for password storage;
* Password/account retrieval/reset mechanisms, their relative advantages and disadvantages;
* Devops: server configuration &amp; security, scalability, database scaling;
* SQLi, XSS, iframe exploits, and myriad other exploitable components of the web ecosystem;
* html5, css3, responsive design, other stuff considered "mandatory" for modern web design;
* the ins &amp; outs of whatever framework you use to build your application (e.g. Rails), as well as being on top of new security fixes and disclosures for it;
* link traversal / leakage of personal information / authentication (what you call access control logic).
*Every* company doing significant business on the web has had a problem with at least one of these. As exploitable stuff goes, this leak of information is regrettable, but still really small beans. (And I'm a coinbase user, and I sharpened my pitchfork and lit my torch when I saw the headline -- until I read the details of it and realized it wasn't that big of a deal.)
I've been doing software development off-and-on *professionally* for 20 years (and as a hobby for getting close to 30 years now), and it's never been as challenging as it is now in the web environment.
