I tried to PM you, but it seems your page 'can't be found'. Anyway, this is the intended message. I hope you somehow find this and it helps.
I got done too. 
Figured you might want to read my 'successful' Customer Support ticket, and the thread I posted recently, to see if you can get anything back or out. Also posted an explanation on Reddit about how I got it back out.

Alternatively, you can always contact your bank, email the conversation log (as screenshots like mine) to your bank and request a recovery of the funds.
Good luck, I hope this helps. Let me know if you'd like any help.

What do you mean you didn't checked igot faq? Which part says "this is exactly how to transfer or withdraw your bitcoin"?

Hey. Come back to the thread if you haven't retrieved your funds yet. I posted a comment here which may help.

There are a shit tonne of government agencies in Australia that can get involved. 
Under Australian consumer law, they are committing a crime by not delivering a good which you have paid for and can show receipts for. Contact NSW Police, NSW Department of Fair Trading, The ACCC and ASIC.

I did, actually. Apparently I was supposed to run a search for "[name] scam" too. Shit.

Got it all back. I'm updating the original post now, if you're interested.

Been sending a PM to all the igot victims. Posting here in hope to reach a larger target audience.










Same goes for anyone else who is here. will be sure to transfer all funds to those who provide him their User IDs publicly, it seems.

Sure, have you got his email address? And maybe the conversations you had with him, to get an idea to what this prick responds to.
