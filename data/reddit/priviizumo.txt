Reckon that's nazi talk.

I understand the effect it will have.  It's the whole 'deflationary' concept of the thing in the first place.
I'm just wondering if it would be possible to do an analysis of this, or whether there has been any study of it.  I mean, it could mean a huge difference in value if 2 out of the 11 million bitcoins that are currently in existence are already permanently lost.  What if it is 5 million?

But mathematically, wouldn't it be possible to find out how long it has been since a specific bitcoin has changed hands?  By analyzing the block-chain?
Knowing that would be a pretty powerful indicator of liquidity?

When, over the space of 25 minutes, the value varies upward of 30%, that's difficult.  I'd prefer it if it wasn't that way.

are you in a pool?

Bingo. Thanks.

Again, I understand the effect.  I'm just interested in what the effect is *right now*.  The total value of bitcoins in value at USD$230 a pop is about 2.5billion.  But that price is being determined by a much smaller amount of buyers/sellers than the 11 million bitcoins would have you believe.  What you actually have is a value betwee 0-2.5 billion, which is the money that is changing hands.
What is that value?  There's a whopping big difference between 2.5billion, 500 million, or 100 million.  Math-wise, I'm not sure if there's a greater, or lesser, risk knowing the value that is permanently inaccessible.
if you get to the total 22 million BC's and 15 million of them are permanently inaccessible, the total value that they can have would potentially be significantly greater than is possible to exchange hands.
I'm wondering if there has been any study of this.

Perfect. Thanks.

I'm all for bitcoins, and not just in the short-term, but the reality is that this is a correction, and in all likelihood, will continue for the foreseeable future.  
I'm not a fan of this.  I can't use my bitcoins to buy things with this type of volatility.  I need for it to be stable for there to be a possibility of using it for commerce.  I'd really hope that it would just settle on one of these numbers for a while.
