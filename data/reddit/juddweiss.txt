And Mastodon's new music video is ultra nerdy but bad ass and epic!

I suppose in the future there might be a market for Bitcoin loans supplied by Bitcoin banks. Those banks would pay interest to depositors in order to attract them to take on the risk of holding Bitcoin in bank accounts instead of their Bitcoin wallet. Holding Bitcoin in a bank deposit becomes a mild investment. As long as it's voluntary I don't see the harm, outside of the risk introduced from lending. 
Are there any other objections to something like that?

As we know, each Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places. So the smallest unit is .00000001 Bitcoin. That will now be expressed as .01 Bits. MUCH easier 
But having to use decimals at all regarding Bits is years away, as that is such a minuscule value right now. 
Crazy amounts of decimals are too hard for most people to digest. Avoiding crazy decimals is the reason for Bits.

I think this is a brilliant idea for Bitcoin. 
1 Bitcoin = 1 Million Bits
Buying something for 3000 Bits is easier to mentally process than .003 Bitcoin

I explain why I used the shuttle footage in a reply to another comment here. It was pure symbolism and had nothing to do with NASA vs SpaceX vs Agorist space projectile. 
Also, I'm targeting those who are NOT libertarian, and even NOT intellectual. Libertarians will harp on this technicality, but the rest of the population will see the symbolism.

That's awesome, thank you Kyle! Let's do something amazing with this election.

Yup, I made sure he was included ;)

I looked through a ton of SpaceX footage. And there was some good stuff, but nothing as beautiful as this. I agree a private space rocket would be more ideologically aligned, and a bunch of intellectual libertarians will harp on that technicality, but the rest of the population will see the symbolism. Let life rise and reach beyond the clouds. I couldn't sacrifice the power of the symbolism I was going for over that technicality. 
I was carefully crafting a hypnotic trance along the notes of the song, and lining up the clips with the words. Kind of a complicated puzzle (first time I ever edited video, and I still don't know my way around the software). Then I aggressively broke that trance at the end with a loud roar of a lift off. 
Let's rise. It's already begun.﻿
