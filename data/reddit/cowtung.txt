Right now we have a shit non-escrow buyer protection system, which solves a very real problem (fraudulent sellers), but in a shit way which makes it easily turned into fraudulent buyer protection.  You can avoid the whole system by buying from known good sellers like Amazon, etc.  But the prices on Amazon are higher.  Buyers can mostly trust the seller ratings on Ebay, but anybody can create a new account and buy on ebay, making a buyer rating system impossible unless we do away with anonymity.  The escrow system where you send items to escrow for inspection before sending it on to the buyer would be expensive.  I think if sellers could establish a good reputation, then after the first 50 successful transactions, the escrow system could become an optional thing the buyer would have to pay for, when buying from certain certified sellers.  The cost of escrow on small time sellers might be burdensome, but if you want to avoid those costs, you might be able to have a verified good seller sell your stuff for you, with their good name behind it, avoiding the escrow step.  Seems to me that the market will be able to figure this one out, one way or another, and that the result has to be better than the current system.

Not trying to be pedantic, I'm just actually interested in the root causes of this.  Do you think that when someone speaks the conjunction "could've" that they are actually saying "could of" and that the word "of" can mean either "of" or "have" depending on context?  Or is English your second language?  Or do you type without thinking, and you started out typing phonetically and developed a habit that you just haven't bothered to correct?  What's your theory?

Unless you had a really shitty interest rate, anything below 4% interest actually isn't a bad thing.  Mortgages are good for taxes.  Think about it...  A whole new form of currency is being brought into the world.  The USD has been the global currency for decades, and now something that simply works better (especially for high-worth individuals who got their money in shady ways) is coming to fruition.  Even if some other alt-coin takes over bitcoin, owing USD at a low interest rate is a better deal than paying it all off right now.  The USD could collapse soon.  Crypto represents an existential risk to a stable USD value.  Borrowing USD at low interest locked in for 30 years is the most sure short on the planet right now.  You'd have done better to convert half your btc into some safe stocks, selling them off a little each month to pay your mortgage minimums.  There is ZERO chance of USD being worth MORE in the future than it is right now.  And you just bought a few hundred thousand USD.

After creating a coinbase account, and logging into coinbase, go over to gdax.com and use limit orders for zero fee conversion to USD.  You can then send that for zero fees to your bank account which will take 4+ days.  In its current state, bitcoin is better as a store of value.  As a replacement for PayPal, it's no good for small transactions, because the fees are too high.  For large transactions, bitcoin is better than other payment methods with percentage-based fees, since bitcoin fees are fixed.
Current bitcoin fee seems to be around $3.77.  Unless you are buying something worth more than $300-$1000, any other payment mechanism will probably have a lower fee.

Some percentage should be in higher risk / higher reward assets.  The riskiest stock in the market doesn't have a potential 100x upside, but has huge potential downside, and just as much risk as bitcoin.  The risk/reward ratio in crypto has been way skewed for a long time.  It's leveled out as the price has gone up, but even a year ago, it was just way too crazy not to put at least a little into it.

I'm not sure what "issues" it could start to have which it doesn't already have.  It's already stuffed up with unconfirmed txs and high fees to get your tx through.  It already has a problem with governance, infighting and conflicting incentive structures between large players.  China has already "banned" it multiple times.  There really isn't anywhere for bitcoin to go other than up.  Even if it sits on its laurels as the first mover with super high fees and slow transactions, so people only use it to store long term value, it could just slog along for the foreseeable future as e-gold.  Even if ETH gains real world traction and its network has huge success, bitcoin could forever survive as ETH's deflationary hedge.  
IMO, fiat is gonna fuck you harder than having a smart spread over the promising alts.  Bitcoin maximalism could work out great, but you should at least put some small money into the ICO's that could go 10x -&gt; 100x.  I bet if you took a look at 50 ICO's over the next 6 months, you could find 5 which had at least a 1/5 chance of going 10x in the next year.  Put $1000 on each (or whatever you can afford to lose) and you should do fairly well.  Most ICO's with decent people behind them don't go to $0, so even the losers won't destroy you.

@_date: 2017-05-25 17:18:43
So you're saying that in the hypothetical scenario where a small user lost some coins, and the thief sold the coins on an exchange, on the ETH chain, a fork to restore the coins would become popular enough that the exchanges, users and miners would majority support it, where under the same scenario on the ETC chain, the fork would not be popular enough to gain traction?  
You are completely kidding yourself if you think the ETH community is dumb enough to do that to itself.  A fork is either popular or it isn't.  I guarantee you that a repeat of the DAO scenario is unlikely on either chain, but if it actually happens, it'll have to be a POPULAR fork, which means most of the stakeholders will have to see it as beneficial.  A second fork to roll back theft would be a tough sell.  
Again, you misrepresent the very valid code-is-law mentality.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:44:27
Please explain to me how the DAO guy could sell coins he didn't have access to until after the fork.  
Are you trolling, or do you just not know how forks work and how the DAO stuff went down?  Do you think that people who own ETH are "forkers" and people who own ETC are "anti-forkers"?  The world isn't that simple.  Anybody can make a fork.  Look, I just forked ETC.  Now which chain is more likely to be forked?  I just forked ETC, so it must be ETC.  
A coin is only as good as the amount of support behind it.  ETH2 won, and unfortunately for the original ETH1 chain, the exchanges agreed to award the name "ETH" to the most popular chain.  But ETH didn't do anything to ETC, other than become more popular.  ETC is still there and churning along.  Anybody who bought ETC from the DAO hacker still got their ETC (which couldn't happen until after the fork, because the coins were locked up).  
Any chain can be forked at any time for any reason.  Both ETH and ETC have equal chance of being forked.  Will the fork be popular?  You're suggesting that an ETH fork would be more popular than an ETC fork, and so if ETH got forked because of a hack, the ETH3 chain would take over the ETH2 chain.  But the vast majority of active ETH holders would have to prefer the ETH3 chain over the ETH2 chain for that to succeed.  That is super unlikely, unless something was very messed up.  So which chain is more likely to get messed up enough that it spawns a popular fork?  If I found a bug in ETC which somehow didn't exist in ETH, and I created 1 billion new ETC coins for myself, and the ETC devs decided to do a fork where everything was exactly the same except the bug was fixed and the 1 billion coins were removed, would you keep using ETC1, or would you start using ETC2 if the price was 10x over ETC1?  What about when the guy starts dumping his ETC1 on the exchanges?  Are you gonna buy his ETC1 and sell your ETC2?  Yes, this is an unlikely scenario, but the majority of active holders of ETH felt about the DAO hack the way any normal person would feel about the scenario I outlined.  Maybe you're an outlier, and would stick with ETC1 no matter what.  Code is law, right?  But if you stick with that mindset, you're putting ideology over profit, and you're gonna lose in the end.  
Code-is-law culture is an interesting mindset, and I support folks who wish to promote it.  But you do your cause a disservice by misrepresenting what happened and demonstrating a lack of basic understanding of how forks work.

They will be correlated until they aren't.  Spread the risk around, rebalance periodically.  They are probably only correlated right now because a lot of people are doing this.  Once Bitcoin solves segwit, expect a lot of people to rebalance back in favor of Bitcoin.

I think the ultimate goal is self-serve remittance, where there is no middle man.  Guy in US buys bitcoin at coinbase (or wherever) and transfers the bitcoin to his family's wallet, and they use something like localbitcoin to get cash.  As we see in China, however, when the flow is mostly one-way, the exchange rate skews (bitcoin as been more expensive in Yuan than in USD for weeks now).  Arbitrage can help fix this in the case of China, but nobody is going to arb the exchange rate down between USD and some 3rd world country.

So far people seem to adhere to whatever matches their incentives.  Threatening to do what you describe is much different than actually sabotaging bitcoin while (probably) holding a ton of btc.
