You're right. The point is, it's very difficult for governments to tax a system based on barter (which is basically just a p2p economy, like bitcoin). 
Historically, the major limitation to barter economies has been the inflexibility of the system: I want a haircut from you, but my service is fixing cars, and you have a bike. With bitcoins, we're suddenly able to barter while enjoying all of the flexibility of cash.

The OP ignores bitcoin's core advantage: taxes. 
Using fiat currency, every dollar you earn or spend is taxed by the state. Let's put taxes at 33% of income (which is low). If you could switch over to using bitcoins entirely, your income would jump 33%, overnight. 
*Employers will be happy to pay the bulk of employees' wages in bitcoin 'bonuses': without tax withholding, they can pay the employee more, while still paying less. 
*Employees will be happy to earn the majority of income in bitcoins: there's no income tax (if they choose not to declare). Suddenly you can get a 20% raise. 
Brick &amp; Mortar retailers will be the least motivated to accept bitcoins: absent a trust relationship with their customer, they're more likely to get "stung" by tax enforcement. The primary advantage for the retailer is escape from CC transaction fees. (Offshore retailers don't share these concerns, and will be able to easily evade taxation on orders). 
Today, the government is concerned that you can buy *drugs* with bitcoins. If you can buy a car with bitcoins, they'll be alarmed. By the time that you can pay rent with bitcoin, they'll be out of a job.

The VAT sounds high, but the other 3 taxes (assuming they're on gross income) put you pretty close to 33% (on par for OECD countries). 
So, let's say your employer manages to pay you a bonus: either $1k in cash or the equivalent in bitcoins. If you take cash, you lose 54% in taxes once you've spent it, so your $1k turns into $440, and you won't be able to buy that new laptop you've been looking at, which costs $950. 
Or, instead, you get $1k in bitcoins. You find an offshore merchant who will take your $1k and send you a computer worth $950. The merchant declares the value of the product to be $100 on the shipping manifest, so you pay $24 in taxes. You have enough left over to buy yourself a taco. 
Bitcoin is an existential threat to the modern-day nation state.

Yeah, online is important - you can't really store cash offshore, and it's relatively expensive or difficult to transport large amounts of cash across borders (especially if you don't want to declare the assets). 
Security is another thing. I can't backup my wallet of twenties. 
I'm not saying that an "underground economy" doesn't exist today. It is certainly rife in many service industries. Bitcoin will just expand the scope of what's possible. A lot.

Yes, but it won't be the person using bitcoins, since they have a perfect mechanism for tax evasion. 
In your example, about $500 goes to taxes. This is the transactional *friction* that bitcoin can eliminate. It won't be practical to do so in all cases, but as the underground economy grows via bitcoin, tax levels within the *formal* economy will need to rise to compensate for the missing taxes. This further increases the *friction* in the formal economy, and makes bitcoins even more attractive.

Are you arguing semantics, or is this a meaningful distinction somehow?
