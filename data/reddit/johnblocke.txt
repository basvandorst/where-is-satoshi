Why would miners attack the bitcoin network? To do so would destroy the massive investments they have made.

My arguments are fake?

Feel free to refute the reason and logic I used in the article.

You replied to the wrong comment. How is running BU attacking the network? The network seems to be working fine. In fact, the price seems to be up $120 since any miner began running bitcoin unlimited.

When I first published the article, I mistakenly used the word "exponential" in place of the word "quadratic." I revised the article after a commenter in pointed it out to me. 
That pokertravis continues using the errata that was only present for a short time belies whatever good intentions he claims to have.

Thanks, I appreciate it. Open dialogue is crucial to finding consensus.

Market forces at work, baby.

Then surely if a big block hard fork happens, you will also agree that it is consensus.

Really?

Do you think that roads do not already connect every city to every other city?

Because they have indicated this is one of their most likely responses numerous times.


I'll leave the logistics of that up to the people who want to change the PoW to figure out. It really makes the most sense for everyone to be using one unified bitcoin.

Hi thanks for your comment. You are correct that individual miners will continue to expend the same amount of resource per block on either chain. What I was trying to convey is that more overall resource must be used to produce a smaller number of bitcoins on that chain, as a whole.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:17:47
Shouldn't we? Is reality defined as what pokertravis says it is?
@_date: 2016-10-16 20:42:26
You mean like SegWit?

That remains to be seen.


Switching to a different work function will force all miners to once again mine on the same chain, which would solve the problem. You could certainly mine your GPU bitcoin, but it would essentially be an altcoin.
