The lyrics are an astoundingly accurate representation of the emotions related with holding bitcoin through the tumult.

Once again, I like the idea of decentralized currency, but if you are concerned and can't afford to lose fiat, don't buy any crypto.  Live your life in the present, which is fiat.  A lot of guys on these forums making $10,000/year banking on bitcoin making them millionaires within 10 years.  Ask yourselves, will your future you have the health to enjoy the money.  What are the conditions under which that will be rewarding.  
I actually like bitcoin, but I'll admit, I also don't hate Roger Ver.  Set it and forget it.  Live in fiat for now.  Buy crypto speculatively.   
Been in bitcoin since 2012.  I've had bitcoin before you had braces, son.

This is a speculative investment.  Currency my ass. Anyone who says they have the answers is a fool.
Do what you want, but let's all be friends.

Overwhelming amount of evidence that lump sum investing is superior to DCA.

Def Andreas please.  This guy has the personality of a cucumber.  
Also, I can't be any more irritated with his weird gesticulation.
