Yes, though the ability of banks to create money is, arguably, what lies behind the last couple of centuries of economic growth. When everything was cash gold creating money to enable new enterprises was difficult. "I promise to pay gold" paper money was the answer. Hyper inflation being much too much of this good thing. 
Anyway, this is the question: how long before someone somewhere starts printing "I promise to pay bitcoin" notes on a fractional reserve basis? And, more important, people have the confidence to accept those notes (physical or electronic) instead of actual bitcoin. Or does this push the bitcoin as gold analogy too far?

Thank you, that is a very interesting answer.
Only mining fresh transactions seems like a very strange thing to do. Any idea why they would choose to do that?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:42:58
You've misread the data. It's 2 addresses with 100,000 - 1,000,000 bitcoin in them. Around three billion dollars...
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:02:09
One single address can contain many bits of dust. For example, if that address received 12 payments, you'll be spending 12 'inputs' when you spend whatever's in the address. If you send the whole balance to another address in your wallet it will be consolidated ('defragged') into one input.
If you send from, say, 6 wallets to a new address, that would mean at least one transaction from each wallet, so that new address will contain 6 inputs.
If you have one wallet with, say, 10 addresses and each address had received 6 inputs, you have 60 inputs in your wallet. You could send the whole wallet's balance EDIT *in a single transaction* (thank you nickkio) to a new address (in the same wallet or elsewhere) and that would consolidate all your bitcoin into one lump. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:55:49
The correct answer is 10 minutes. The reason is counter-intuitive and sometimes called the hitch-hiker paradox.
Basically, if you submit a transaction at a random time you are more likely to submit it in a long gap than a short gap. If you submit a number of transactions at random times, more will be submitted in long gaps than short gaps. That simple notion underpins the mathematics laid out [here]( It is worth reading but it needs concentration and an open mind as it is a bit, as I said, counter-intuitive.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:23:55
Future transactions, spending the defragged bitcoin, will be smaller - which is a great help at busy times. Whether the UTXO being smaller helps the efficiency of the system as a whole I don't know - but hope somebody will come along who does.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:46:16
You'll have to explain that to me! Their most recent block was [181 KB]( - I'm at a loss to understand how it's in their interest to have left lots of juicy transactions unmined.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:13:08
Yes, I think we are entering a time when low fees and [regularly emptying mempool]( are the new normal.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:24:45
Person opinion: neither.
Although millions of bits of dust have been consolidated, the total amount of BTC they represent is relatively small.
For example, although there are now nearly 3.5 million fewer addresses with balances of 0 - 0.001 BTC, the amount of BTC in addresses with balances of 0 - 0.001 has only dropped by about 500 BTC. See links on OP.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:27:33
Some wallets allow you to set fees as satoshi per KB. So you could set it to 500 per KB which would be 0.5 s/b.
However, most miners won't pick up transactions under 1 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:34:49
In December there was frenzy, huge backlogs of transactions built up, fees skyrocketed.
In January the transaction rate dropped from the frenzy peak and the mempool began to shrink - and fees fell. People (and exchanges) then realised they could consolidate their wallets at low fees - often just 1 sat/byte. So for the last two months there has been a lot of catch-up defragging. That catch-up now seems to have finished. So, after about 4 months we're back on an even keel.
However, in the meantime exchanges have started to batch - which saves a lot of blockspace - and segwit is starting to mean bigger blocks. Put all that together and right now we have lower demand and significantly increased capacity (thanks to batching and segwit).
So the mempool is now regularly [emptying]( which means your 1 sat/byte transaction now has a good chance of getting into the next few blocks. So why pay more.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:11:27
No, they will still be there. If you can gain access to the wallet.dat file or similar, or have the private keys you can regain access.
Be very careful what advice you listen to: never disclose your private key to anyone or any website, however nice or legit they seem.
Spend the next few days googling and researching. There's no rush.

The result of Coinbase going SegWit? I believe it's by the middle of this week they planned to be 100% SegWit - i.e. about now. Better late than never!
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:46:59
Your first paragraph is spot on.
Re second para: when you send your dust in a single transaction, the dust coagulates into a single lump. The address to which you send the transaction receives only one input. So when you later come to spend it, you're spending one lump. The fact it was previously dust is 'forgotten'.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:09:58
You have to send everything to one address EDIT: *in a single transaction* (thank you nickkio), yes, and that will consolidate it into one lump. But you do not need  to send it anywhere else after that.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:38:01
I think you are right. The bottom chart [here]( shows the mempool is now regularly emptying. Transactions at 1 sat/byte are getting into the next block.
Though some people are still paying *way* higher fees than they need to. I guess it will take a while to sink in that 1 sat/byte really is enough once again.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:44:55
You can send it directly to yourself with all wallets as far as I am aware, though I don't know Trezor specifically. If you have a lot of bitcoin it might be worth considering not putting it all in one huge lump: when you later make a small transaction everyone can see you had a lot of change going back to yourself. Also, try a small test transaction first? That's only going to cost you a couple of cents (see next para...).
But please be careful about the fee setting! 1 sat/byte is enough at the moment - [see this](
EDIT: I've always thought the best sized lumps to have in a wallet are the amounts you're likely to spend in the future. So if you buy things around $20, having your bitcoin in $20 lumps might be good. But if every future transaction is going to be $5000, then $5000 lumps would be good. Or a mix if you are likely to do both.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:19:45
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:16:32
I agree.
And the addresses the guy below has posted look like classic examples of defragging: hundreds of dust addresses have been emptied into the [first of his addresses]( Not spam unless I've really missed something. Was that your conclusion too?
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:02:01
I agree with vegarde. Batch your inputs together into a single transaction and send to yourself. If you are not in a hurry, use a fee of 1 sat/byte: it may take a few days to clear but no problem if there's no rush.
You might want to send to a segwit address as it will be cheaper to send from there in the future.
If you have a large amount of bitcoin, consider batching into several transactions, so your BTC does not end up in one huge lump.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:54:50
Hover over the peaks on [johoe's charts]( and you'll see some people are still paying 700 or even 1000 sat/byte when a fraction of that would get them into the next block. Some wallets have rubbish fee calculators; maybe some people don't visit Reddit and don't realise fees have dropped.
Some exchanges' etc fees *have* been reduced recently, but it will take a period of time with consistently low fees until exchange fees fully come down to reflect that fact. In the meantime, contact the overchargers and politely suggest they reduce their fees...
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:14:55
Would be interesting to add a piece on Dorian - why he is not 'Satoshi' (I assume that's very much your view). Did he have the technical skills to be Satoshi, for example? I've seen that the white paper is not in his writing style - was he capable of writing its draft and have someone else improve its style? If he did have the skills but had nothing to do with bitcoin and his name was chosen randomly that would be one heck of a coincidence!
I ask because I don't know and would like to. I am not suggesting he was or wasn't Satoshi or one of the pseudonymous group. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:23:56
There's no evidence that the number of wallets is reducing. Indeed, stats like [this]( suggest the number of wallets is increasing.
The number of addresses containing bitcoin is decreasing. So, maybe your wallet had 10 addresses and you send your whole balance to one new address in your wallet. Fewer addresses, same number of wallets.
So, if by centralisation you imply bitcoin is held by fewer people/organisations, I'd say no, that's not the case.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:02:48
Thanks for this clarification. I have edited my posts above accordingly.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:29:24
F2Pool mine about 7 blocks a day which have until now usually been less than half full: their change to mining full blocks effectively adds 3 or 4 blocks per day of extra mining capacity.
 
Regrettably Bitcoin.com are still mining blocks [like this]( with no transactions under 10 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:06:44
Each input will add [180 bytes to the transaction]( At 1 sat/byte that's 180 satoshi which is about 2 US cents per input.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:29:12
OK, gotcha. Not a snag at all.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:21:35
Ah yes, you are correct. I'm guessing non-troll meant to say 0.001 (the top of the range in the OP) was around 8 bucks.
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:11:31
Are you sure it's broken? 
It's recommending 1 sat/byte. Looking at the [bottom chart here]( that fee will get you into the next block at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:22:27
I guess the UTXO tends to grow as use grows - I don't know of anything particular that happened around July 2015. I did come across [this]( when looking for events around that time. Interesting!
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:31:52
My understanding is that 1 sat/byte is the minrelayfee default. But each node can set its own value for minrelayfee.
If bitcoin reaches the giddy heights of $1M one could imagine the minrelayfee being reduced to, say, 1/100th of a satoshi to maintain the same price:minumun fee ratio.
However, please take the above with a pinch of salt: my understanding could be wrong - I trust someone will be good enough to correct or confirm the above.

There have been many many threads about how easy a 51%, double spend attack on BCH is technically. This guy is right about that, of course.
But he's too limited in his risk/reward example - a 51% attack on BCH would destroy it: if someone makes a 51% attack, everybody knows other people could and might make further attacks - trust would be lost, value would crash. 
OK, so it's only BCH, and the rogue miner may have offloaded all his BCH before the crash and even shorted BCH too.
But the destruction of BCH would surely have a major impact on trust in BTC. The miner's investment in mining kit and future BTC mining revenues would be severely hit.
In other words, yes, an attack like this is very possible. But no, nobody would be stupid enough to do it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:36:11
Thank you for finding that tweet. So their 5 sat/byte minimum is quite intentional. Strange.  Let's hope they have a change of heart as fees fall, lest they mine increasing numbers of small blocks and miss out on more and more fees.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:14:27
Yes, but why would they leave a bundle of free dollar bills on the table and not pick it up?
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:55:16
That might be the number of transactions being added to the mempool rather than the number being mined. The mempool is growing at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:55:27
And [BitFury]( is just weird: they mine SegWit transactions and mine all the way down to 1 sat/byte. Yet most of their blocks are unfull. Anyone know why?
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:21:03
Understand. But just stating why he's "obviously" not Satoshi would be interesting.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:12:15
Yes, very unlikely the two were written by the same guy.
Do we know what Dorian's profession was? 
Just read [this]( suggesting Satoshi is Nick Szabo - who may have been contacted by someone who said: "I've got a great idea for improving bit gold...". And Nick goes: "Wow - yes! That's brilliant! Write a paper." And the reply comes: "No idea how to write a paper..." And Nick says: "OK, I'll write it up and put your name on it." Would Dorian have had the skills to be that person? So having come up with the key idea that made bitcoin work, Dorian had little or no further involvement and handed it all over to Nick and other people to take forward. Or am I straying well into the realms of fantasy..?

@_date: 2018-02-12 08:26:07
But don't switch to [F2Pool]( they are refusing to mine transactions with fees of less than 5 sat/byte. They are mining un-full blocks and not picking up all the transaction fees they could.
And definitely don't switch to [bitcoin.com]( - they don't mine any transaction with less than a 10 sat/byte fee and are leaving money (that could be yours!) on the table.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:32:41
Yes indeed, as said above, batching also reduces outputs.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:10:23
Delighted to hear you managed to consolidate at 1 sat/byte. 
For the last 24 hours the [mempool has been clearing regularly]( I think after a long period of high fees and unpredictable waits we are entering an era of low fees and short waits.

Release notes: "*Also, version 0.16.0 will only create hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.*"
Might some interpret this to mean 0.16.0 will convert existing wallets to HD? It's obvious to those in the know that it won't, but maybe not to non-experts? "Note: 0.16.0 will not convert pre-existing wallets to HD"?

@_date: 2018-02-25 19:43:44
Yes, it is different. But do you believe he doesn't include all transactions that have non-zero fees? Assuming he doesn't intentionally exclude any non-zero-fee transactions that get broadcast, is it still possible for another mempool to include non-zero-fee transactions that JoHoe doesn't?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:13:11
What PV says is of course absolutely correct. When the layman says he has an address with funds in it, his statement is shorthand for saying he has a key that gives him ownership - the ability to spend - certain unspent outputs that exist on the blockchain.
It is quite useful to understand this because it makes it abundantly clear how it is that one address can 'contain' many separate bits of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:02:32
Did your deep dives convince you that Dorian cannot be that one person? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:15:52
November and December witnessed something of a bitcoin frenzy. That's quietened down - for the moment anyway. Segwit is slowly increasing transaction throughput and exchanges batching is reducing their use of blockspace.
When 0.16.0 comes out in the next couple of weeks we'll probably see a big adoption of segwit (at last) which will increase capacity.
Many people are taking advantage of low fees to defrag at the moment. That will last another few weeks. After that, with segwit, batching, and the defrag hump over, we could be in for a period when low fees - 1 s/b or 10 s/b if you're in a hurry - become the norm again. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:22:15
Ah, got it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:34:19
I'd say probably not. It's usually a person consolidating the dust in their wallet into bigger lumps in that wallet. And the same for exchanges' wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:11:35
I think most of what's being added to the mempool in the 1 sat/byte band is large defragging transactions judging by what's been mined in recent blocks.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:43:09
Good question.
Suppose you receive 10 transactions into your wallet and those 10 inputs add up to 0.1 bitcoin. You now decide to spend your 0.1. You are actually spending 10 things, and each of those 10 things has to be referenced in your spend transaction. From memory each input takes 180 bytes. So the more fragments you're spending the bigger your transaction, the more it costs you.
Which is why, when fees are very low, people 'defrag' their wallets: you send your 10 (or 100 or 1000) fragments to yourself in one big transaction. (I've seen defragmentation transactions of well over 50,000 bytes.) Your bitcoin is now all in one lump - you only have one input in your wallet. So, when you need to spend some of it it will be a 226 byte transaction - which is very good news if fees happen to be high when you need to spend it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:28:55
Ah no, sorry, my comment above wasn't clear and led you to the wrong conclusion.
When there are plenty of transactions with fees of 5 sat/byte or more they produce full blocks. It's only when there aren't enough 5+ s/b transactions that they produce unfull blocks. [F2Pool blocks](
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:41:58
You'll need to be patient. The blockrate has been slow for the last few hours ([only 4.33]( over the last 3 hours), and a swathe of transactions at 20-30 sat/byte have come in. [Bottom chart](
Give it a couple of hours and your 14 sat/byte transaction will go through.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:23:46
That was true until a couple of days ago. I'm happy to say that F2Pool are now mining all the way down. [Post from Monday]( [F2Pool's latest blocks](
EDIT: the top twelve on [this list]( (bottom left hand panel) mine all the way down except: 58COIN who don't go below 5 sat/byte and bitcoin.com don't mine below 10 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:05:04
OK, right, then shouldn't it say: The first time you run 0.15.0 or a newer version...
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:26:04
At the moment 5 sat/byte will usually get you into the next block, see [bottom chart light blue band]( (you'd be at the top of the light blue band), and 1 sat/byte is fine if you can wait a day or so for your transaction to clear.
So, for a 1 in 2 out transactions that's 15 cents max, 3 cents min.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:15:53

The top 5 pools and BTCC (7th) all mine 1 sat/byte transactions. [F2Pool]( and 58COIN don't mine below 5 s/b. [Bitcoin.com]( doesn't mine below 10 s/b.
Until 2 weeks ago AntPool didn't mine below 5 s/b, but they changed their settings and now do.
So about 90% of mining goes all the way down - F2Pool not mining below 5 s/b is like having a sleek V8 that's misfiring on one cylinder. About 40MB of mining has been lost through not mining all the way down. So you're right about the mempool.

I've replied to your sparring partner with the aim of informing the debate. Please see above - or possibly below...
I'd also add that in the longer run as the block reward halves every 4 years, fees become a bigger and bigger slice of miners' pay packets, thus increasing their incentive to mine all the transactions they can lay their hands on.
I'd also speculate that if bitcoin gets anywhere near the giddy heights of $1M that the lower fee limit (actually I think it's the minrelayfee setting) would be reduced to, for example, 1/100th of a satoshi/byte, to retain the same ratio vs the price. The 1 sat/byte limit is not cast in stone - it's a setting each node can adjust.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:41:56
My guess is services will spring up that will take Lightning payments for small retailers (for example) and once a day (say) pay the retailer with a good old fashioned on-chain, asynchronous BTC transaction.
So you have to trust the service, but only with (in the example) one day's takings.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:42:13
They are each doing it on their own. When one gets lucky and finds a block the pool tells them all to start again with a new set of transactions. They each work on their own... Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:35:04
Though if they're charging you $1 that doesn't tell us how much they're actually paying in transaction fees.

Over the past [24 hours]( the mauve 10 sat/byte transactions have been cleared in most blocks (bottom chart). But you're right in that there have been a couple of times when a 10 sat/byte would have waited about an hour - e.g.
 [around 1pm today](
Anyway, 1000 sat/byte is crazy!
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:52:24
The band of 20-30s just cleared, so your 14 sat/byte transaction should go through in the next couple of blocks with any luck. [Bottom chart](
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:57:10


Yes. The hashing of the transactions in a block is a minuscule part of the cost. Once you have the transactions hash, hashing it with zillions of nonces until you get a result is where the cost comes in.
The transactions hash is the same size regardless of how many transactions it represents, so the zillions do not take longer with more transactions. So it is pretty much free money they are leaving on the table by not including transactions with fees below 5 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:12:26
And just to balance things up with a nice demonstration of randomness, as of 13:10 GMT there's only been 1 block in the last hour.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:40:24
Yes - as you say that's 31MB of transactions that could and should have been mined. And by strange coincidence at the time of writing the [mempool]( stands at 31MB. If these guys had been good citizens and not had the 5 sat/byte limit, the mempool would now be emptying.
Until last weekend AntPool weren't mining transactions below 5 sat/byte, but they changed their policy and now are. Come on F2Pool, please change your policies too. That's free money you're leaving on the table.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:51:36
Here’s one more theory to add to the long list. Satoshi was a Spook.
You’d expect the intelligence community to keep abreast of developments around cryptography and cyphers – they’d be well tuned in to the cypherpunk movement.
Someone at GCHQ or the NSA reads about Nick Szabo’s Bit Gold and contacts him anonymously (they’d be good at that) and offers assistance on condition Nick never reveals the collaboration. Perhaps the spook suggests the use of SHA256 hashing and perhaps it is he who proposes the elegant solution to the double spend problem that is at the heart of bitcoin. You’d expect GCHQ and NSA people to be at the leading edge in those sorts of areas.
Maybe Nick doesn’t know exactly where the guy works but has a pretty good idea he’s a spook and keeps the secret even to this day. (Would you cross those guys?) Perhaps the spook drafts parts of the white paper, perhaps he contributes code to Nick. Maybe the spook’s collaboration wasn’t sanctioned by his organisation - would the deep state want to aid and abet an alternative to the established monetary order?
After the creation of the initial bitcoin software we have a record of emails between Satoshi and Hal Finney. But we have no record of communication between collaborators in the creation of the white paper or the initial bitcoin software. Either they were created by a single person or communication between collaborators has simply been lost. Or communication was done securely and all trace of it erased. And who would be able to do that?
The reference to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in the genesis block, and the presence of the word ‘favour’ rather than ‘favor’ in the white paper perhaps give us a slight nudge in the direction of GCHQ.
At least this would help explain the secrecy surrounding Satoshi’s identity. But why didn’t Nick put his own name on the white paper? And why the name Satoshi Nakamoto? Perhaps all will be revealed one day when the spook has his pension firmly secured. Though if he has a chunk of the initial bitcoin he probably doesn’t need a pension – but that’s only been clear relatively recently. Maybe he likes his job and simply wants to proceed hassle-free to a normal retirement.
The above is unlikely – but then again so are all the other theories. 
[This link]( suggests Nick Szabo wrote the white paper which would be compatible with the above, but [this link]( seems to suggest Nick was rather more detached from the development of the concepts that made bitcoin different from Bit Gold.

When segwit peaked at 18% an exchange was putting through a lot of defrag transactions - they were defragging stuff already in segwit addresses. So big blocks with loads of segwit.
EDIT: They're at it again. Since 19:00 GMT [few transactions added but lots of MB added]( taking advantage of low fees. In other words a small number of very big transactions. Looks like someone is [defragging and segwitising]( in [this block]( for example. Very wise. (Going into a segwit address isn't a segwit trasaction, but when they spend their defragged segwitised booty they'll save a lot if fee are higher at that time.)

If you buy via AliExpress in China that's exactly what they do. Your money goes to AliExpress and only when you confirm you've received the goods does AliExpress pay the merchant. It seems to work well.

Defragging doesn't imply centralisation. It means each wallet has fewer addresses: the number of wallets doesn't necessarily change. Indeed, there's [evidence to suggest]( the number of wallets has increased while all this defragging has been going on.

Just a shame AntPool and F2Pool aren't mining transactions with less than 5 sat/byte or it would be going down even faster. See [recent blocks](
Over the past week or so their un-full blocks have wasted about 20MB of blockspace - about half the current size of the mempool.
EDIT: AntPool have changed their policy and are now [mining the low-fee transactions]( Well done, Antpool.
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:42:16
Well I for one am confused. Where are you getting the 100 sat/byte rate from?
And I see btc.com now recommends 2 sat/byte which would seem to indicate it is working just fine. That's exactly the fee you need to pay at the moment.
And third, calling PV's comment inane really isn't necessary. He and I are both trying to be helpful here.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:21:19
I guess you're looking at fork.lol? Their prediction is based only on very recent blocks so is quite volatile. A smoother guide is [this one]( that looks over the whole period. Currently we're running only about 2% over 6 blocks/hr so far this period.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:56:49
Clever. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:34:27
Yes. BTC difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks or so. If average time between blocks had been, say, 9 minutes just before the DA, difficulty would rise with the aim of making the time between blocks increase to 10 minutes. Yes, that decreases the number of transactions processed, at least temporarily.
It's an average and as this thread shows the actual spacing of blocks can vary wildly in the short term.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:07:36
Not that it matters. If some high-cost miners drop out and the blockrate falls below 6/hr, difficulty will adjust down making it cheaper to mine. It's self-levelling.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:52:34
It's interesting how the English language changes over time...
You can usually tell which posters are C++ programmers (or similar), as they don't leave a space before a left bracket(as per this thread's title).
I wonder if there are enough programmers in the world to  shift the convention from space to no space. Hmmm. Thought for the day.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:51:07
Usually defragging is someone (a person or an exchange) sending their bitcoin to themselves. So ownership wouldn't be affected.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:32:03
Yes indeed. But *why* would they choose not to pick up what is pretty much free money?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:36:01
AntPool are mining transactions all the way down now: they do still produce the occasional block with the 5 sat/byte limit, but that's probably just one of their servers where they've forgotten to change the settings.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:44:07
That can't be right. Where are you seeing that? See [fork.lol]( for a more likely number.
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:57:17
But some people are *still* [paying 700 sat/byte]( - or even 1400 sat/byte!
Do we know specifically which wallets are recommending fees of 700 sat/byte, when even 10 sat/byte would be extravagant?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:45:19
Yup, OK. I had edited my comment above just as you were replying with a bit of stream of consciousness type imagining - but I guess it's just that.
Anyway, many thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:42:32
Yes. If the price of bitcoin remains the same, each halvening makes mining less profitable on the same equipment. Either more power-efficient kit comes on stream or, if it doesn't, hashpower drops as higher-cost miners drop out and difficulty drops. Either way, more power-efficient mining is the result - as you suggest.
Will the bitcoin price (at least) double every 4 years to counteract the above...? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:10:42
Still going on. EDIT: In total they had their program running for 15 hours sweeping up the dust.
Brief to the programmers: "Take every input we have of 0.001 or less and consolidate 300 at a time to a segwit address @ 1 sat/byte". Who cares if it takes a week to get the transactions mined, it's chickenfeed. Bigger lumps we'll defrag into segwit by hand, over time, with higher fees.
Transactions only show as segwit if they're coming *from* segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:00:58
That is even more interesting info, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:53:40
Absolutely. Batching means outputs per transaction goes up, total number of outputs goes down. For the same amount of actual, er, let's call them deals. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:44:46
Ah, OK. Yes, if everyone put a 5 s/b minimum it would push fees up. Fortunately AntPool went the other way and removed their 5 s/b lower limit a couple of weeks ago. Let's hope F2Pool see the light and follow suit.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:08:58
Possibly because low fees have brought the defraggers out of the woodwork? Large transactions with only one output.  Segwit and batching pushing outputs per block and per transaction up, defraggers pushing them down.
The [UTXO]( is going down due to all the defragging.
Eg [this one]( - a 37K transaction (only $7 fee!) with one output. One of many transactions to the same [output address]( - presumably an exchange defragging and segwitising while fees are low.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:50:55
[BW.COM]( don't mine blocks bigger than 1MB. I believe this is because they don't mine SegWit transactions.
Does anyone know why?
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:26:11
I wouldn't like to speculate on why bitcoin.com don't mine below 10 sat/byte. I would make two observations.
When mining a block, the transactions to be included are hashed. That hash is then hashed with zillions of nonces until a hash with the requisite value (or lower) is found. The transactions hash is the same size regardless of how many transactions it represents. The mining time is spent hashing the transactions hash with nonces - the time to hash the transactions is vanishingly small in comparison.
Until a few weeks ago AntPool were not mining transactions below 5 sat/byte. When the mempool started to empty of high-fee transactions they started mining a lot of not-full blocks thus leaving fee money on the table. AntPool changed their policy and now mine all the way down. And of course F2Pool have now followed suit. 58COIN still don't mine below 5 sat/byte but who knows, when they realise there's effectively free money they're not picking up, maybe they will change too.

As more and more development gets done on Core, it becomes harder for Bcash to simply copy code across: a new bit of code in Core may rely on another bit of Core code that Bcash doesn't have. So at the very least Bcash would have to test very carefully any code lifted from Core.

You'd have to make a transaction which sent bitcoin from an address (or addresses) in your wallet to a new address in your wallet. The new address receives one input.

@_date: 2018-02-11 16:03:50
Check very carefully you're using the fee you want to use. Some wallets default to fees 10 or even 100 times higher than necessary!
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:01:20
Interesting - please could you elaborate? Say you had 100 bits of dust, how would Schnorr affect the size of your defrag transaction?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:23:00
It looks as if AntPool may not have updated all their servers with the new settings as they do still produce the occasional block with the old limit of 5 sat/byte.
[This transaction]( is in their [most recent block,  at 1.706 s/b, but the two previous blocks have the old 5 s/b limit. And before those, a [run of full ones]( with low fee transactions, with one unfull one in the middle of the run.

He concludes the average time between blocks is of course 10 minutes, but if you make an observation at a randomly-chosen time, the average of the gaps you observe will be 20 minutes. Basically because it's more likely your random time will fall within a 20 minute interval than a 5 minute interval for example.

"*Confirmation on blockchain may take a minute or two*" - how do you manage to achieve that?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:57:43
Yes. [Speculation]( is it's Coinbase defragging and segwitising their holdings prior to announcing that in future all their send transactions will be segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:07:22
Sure is. [This block]( has only 20K of transactions for example.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:38:41
Yes, if they were a really big pool the fact they don't mine low-fee transactions might push fees up. But they are so small I don't think they would have an effect on fee rates. Maybe it is as you suggest - they just haven't got around to changing their settings.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:12:02

"*The first time you run a version newer than 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format*" in [draft release notes]( Is that right or should it be newer than 0.15.1? Ditto following para.

OK, though why would sometimes producing full blocks and sometimes not help them in that (or any other) respect?
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:14:50
Though on reflection I'm still not quite sure why something that changed in 0.15.0 is being highlighted in the 0.16.0 release notes. You don't mean 0.16.0 or higher do you?
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:18:59
You're right - Bitcoin.com don't mine transactions that have a fee of less than 10 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:38:30
Thank you.
In my opinion there is far less spam than some people like to suggest. Most of the recent so-called spam has turned out to be defrag transactions upon examination. That said, I have seen a few - just a few - transactions that seemed to have no purpose whatsoever and looked spammy. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:24:07


JoHoe includes all transactions that have non-zero fees - see last sentence on [this page](

The only snag with that argument is that bitcoin's production cost can be approximately zero.
If the price falls, miners drop out and difficulty falls - lowering bitcoin's production cost. In the extreme case all the mining farms close down and bitcoin is mined on laptops at ~zero cost.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:01:40
Gotcha. Though we see very few orphaned blocks these days. It would be interesting to work out the saving in transmission time as a percentage of average time to mine a block. Then work out how many orphanings are prevented and set that income against the loss of income from not including all possible transactions in every block. But not a sum I'm going to attempt!
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:25:58
That's a very interesting chart, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:13:56
Has anyone analysed the numbers to get at the real number of transactions?
Batching obviously reduces the raw number of transactions. So you can count outputs. But batching also reduces outputs: a small transaction might have 1 input and two outputs (one being change) - a hundred such small transactions would have 200 outputs. But batch them and you get one transaction with only 101 outputs: 100 outputs plus a change output.
Makes getting at the underlying 'real' transaction rate tricky. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:20:14
At 5 s/b for 226 bytes, that's 5x226=1130. Putting 1130 satoshi into [this converter]( tells us it's just under 10 cents.
If your bitcoin is lots of bits of dust, a transaction will be more than 226 bytes and so cost more.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:20:18
Yes, I agree. Very probably one entity doing some big house cleaning. Pure speculation: Coinbase defragging into segwit addresses?
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:06:13
Look at the bottom chart [here]( Mauve transactions are 5-10 sat/byte and are regularly clearing. The light blue band, 2-5 s/b clear every now and again. Even some 1 sat/byte transactions are getting mined.
So many sites quote average fees which is very misleading as it includes huge exchange transactions.
At 5 sat/byte a one-in-two-out 226 byte transactions would cost about 10 cents. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:59:30
Suppose you have an urgent transaction to do when fees are high and your bitcoin consists of 100 tiny bits of dust. Your transaction will be ~100X148 bytes - around 15KB. At high fees that will be expensive!
But if you defrag your coins into one lump when fees are 1 sat/byte, your later urgent transaction will only be about 226 bytes and even if fees are high won't cost you much. 
So the wise wait for quiet times and defrag their wallets at 1 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:14:45
SlushPool are good guys, they mine all the way down.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:54:53
Personally I'd only bother to move stuff to a segwit address if I was defragging at the same time. 
Though if you might want to do urgent transactions in the future when fees might be high, it could be worth taking the opportunity to segwitise when fees are very low.
