Bitcoin Gold. There might be some others as well that I don't remember.

This is actually a really solid strategy.

There was a well known attempt at a decentralized/p2p Facebook (Diaspora I think it was called?) that failed pretty miserably.

This pattern is true of the stock market as well. The biggest daily gains are usually after the largest drops, and as a result if you missed out the best 20 days of the S&amp;P 500 in the past 30 years your average returns drop massively, from something like ~8% to ~2% per year.

Social networks predated either of those (Friendster, Myspace). And coming up with an idea is far less important that correct execution. There were dozens of search engines before Google, but only one of them ended up being...well, Google. Does Google owe Askjeeves anything for "stealing" their search engine idea? If I loosely describe an idea about a car that can travel in space, should nobody be allowed to build it because it's "my" idea?
Granted, Zuckerberg was kind of a dick when the twins hired him to work on their site and he stonewalled for a few months to get Facebook off the ground. But it's not like that 3 month head start was why Facebook blew up and the Winklevosses site didn't--after all, Myspace already had millions of users at this point.
I think a fairer settlement would've been more like 65,000, not 65 million.

They also got a cool 65m (underserved in my opinion) from suing Zuckerberg long before this as well.

Beginning Sunday you can buy Bitcoin futures. Some are worried that will cause a correction as investors will be able to short Bitcoin, and this massive upswing is the "pump" before the "dump" when the futures arrive. I honestly have no idea if that's accurate or not.

Yeah, I put a sell in for $1000 above where I bought. Either I make a thousand or a lose everything, but nothing in between.

California is on track for a 19 billion budget surplus: 
I think the state is doing just fine

I bought it at $2950. Fortunately I didn't buy much, but that was easily my worst crypto decision.

California has significant problems (primarily, the housing affordability crisis that is solvable if the political will was actually there), but I often online commenters talk about California as if it's a state on the verge of collapse when it's arguably the most prosperous one in the country, while still maintaining the nation's strongest worker and environmental protections.
Hopefully they address the housing crisis and traffic issues (which seem pervasive in every major city there) in the near future. 
As far as I know, the Medicare for all plan didn't get very far. I don't see how that really works unless implemented on a national level.

Source? I googled "states with highest poverty rate" and this is what came up as the first result: 
To save you from the annoying slideshow, I'll reproduce the list here:
1. Mississippi
2. Louisiana
3. New Mexico
4. Kentucky
5. West Virginia
6. Arkansas
7. Alabama
8. Arizona
9. Oklahoma
10. Georgia
There's a pretty obvious pattern here, which is that with maybe the exception of New Mexico, every single one of these states are politically and culturally the opposite of California. There are also many documented cases of other states busing homeless people to California since it has a relatively generous social net for the homeless: 
I don't know how much that affects the poverty rate, but it could be that CA is a better place too be poor than other states, and thus impoverished people move there and artificially inflate the poverty rate.
I agree with the traffic and housing crisis--as I mentioned in other comment in this thread, those are huge issues the state needs to tackle is currently handling terribly. I have mixed feelings about the level of regulation--some things are terrible, like the high LLC costs you mention and the absurd housing regulations, but others, like the strong worker protections, are ones that benefitted me and other regular, working people.
To call the state with the largest and most prosperous economy in the country (not to mention and net tax donor to other states) a "shithole" is out of touch with reality.
