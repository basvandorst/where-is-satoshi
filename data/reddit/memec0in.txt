Banks service hundreds of millions/billions of people every day. Bitcoin services a few hundred thousand at best. This is not a good thing.

I've done my homework and I've concluded the opposite. The Lightning network is a complete joke.

Second layer solutions defeat the point of the blockchain and over complicate things. Bitcoin will never be a common currency in the same way that gold bars will never be a common currency. There are many other cryptocurrencies that are far better suited for that task. Bitcoin is best suited for holding value and transferring large amounts of wealth.

One of the most hilarious things I've read all day and precisely the mindset that has allowed him to play America like a fiddle despite the substantially smaller economy, military, and geopolitical influence.


Well apparently successful leadership hasn't been seen in America since Reagan, and won't be seen for a long time to come by the looks of things. America is in the midst of destroying itself both culturally and politically due in part to Soviet initiated subversion tactics that began decades ago, much less modern day efforts by Putin, who is no doubt continuing the tradition with great motivation from your politicians.

So you're saying that short-term price movements are indicative of quality? Sorry but you're wrong. Alts have been bleeding relative to Bitcoin because people are selling their alts in order to ride the bitcoin rebound. This is why most alt charts looks pretty much the same. Most of the ones that don't pumped or dumped on some particular piece of news that has nothing to do with long-term prospects.

Sure, and without the dialup modem there is no internet. But we don't use dialup modems anymore. The notion that Bitcoin's proof of work algorithm - which requires the daily power consumption of 8 households for a single transaction, and is controlled by a small handful of mining pools in China - is the best technology that exists, is quite frankly delusional.

Your country's leadership is the real joke.

Networking isn't an algorithm, it's a concept. And that concept transcends any particular implementation or technology. The dialup modem is part of an implementation. Bitcoin is not a concept, it's an implementation. Blockchain is the concept, and like networking, the blockchain isn't tied to any particular implementation or technology.


The vast majority of which belong to a small handful of mining pools: 
The three biggest pools collectively control &gt;51% of the network.

Your chart shows transactions at 2015 levels, less than half of what they were at their peak in December. I don't get why bitcoin enthusiasts are trying to use this as some sort of evidence that the BTC network isn't inherently a steaming pile of trash relative to newer technology.

Have the past 4 years of failed sanctions not taught you anything? 8 straight years of economic/political interference and military provocations resulting in the absolute humiliation of your country with a clown for a president, and yet you fools still don't get the picture. But by all means, keep poking the bear some more. It is, after all, your God given right as the world police force.
The reason countries like Russia, China, Iran etc. are so keen on cryptocurrencies is because they have the potential to reduce the power of the USD, and in turn reduce America's (and global financial organizations such as the WTO and IMF) ability to fuck with their economies and trading activity. Obviously neo-conservative/neo-liberal Americans don't like the prospect of other countries acting autonomously in their own interests though (to the point where they *will* utterly destroy a country and have its leader murdered if push comes to shove, see: Libya/Gaddafi), so I suspect we'll see a lot of pushback from the McCains and the Clintons and their groupies in due time. 
They (emerging economies who aren't too keen on being America's lapdogs) have been talking about switching reserve currencies for a while now.

There's nothing inherently decentralized about the blockchain. It just serves decentralization particularly well.


The two aren't mutually exclusive.


I'm glad you were able to demonstrate your superior knowledge by explaining where I was wrong.

The weird thing is how you've responded to me three times in a row without saying anything of any substance whatsoever. Insults don't make you right.

Those aren't lies though...
