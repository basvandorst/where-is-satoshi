I also believe it's a botnet, but I also think there are people out there who are talented enough to piece together enough clues on who's doing it. It's a coordinated attack, people talk, there are chat logs of ideas like this.
My idea is that a bounty would motivate this investigation.
Actually - my idea is that the discussion of a bounty will give an activist the idea to do something on their own.


Completely agreed about moving exchanges - but is there a way to mitigate against an attack like this? I'm sure Mt Gox could do better, but if someone has a large enough botnet then isn't it almost impossible to guard against this?
There is so much money to be made in BTC volatility, and so many people willing to write malware for so many reasons, that I would guess there is an almost endless supply of opportunities for botnets into the future.

Yeah it seems so.
But I would think it is smart to write an HFT bot that says:
- flood with x microtransactions until y price reached then purchase z bitcoins in one transaction.
So I still wonder if these are trading bots that have a final execution order as well, to lose money to make money on the final trade. 
Although, realistically, the actual trade is probably made by labrador after he pawed the "spam microtransaction" button a few times...

This is amazing, it's on both sides, mostly 0.01, but up to 0.05.
War of the microtransactions.
Makes me think of the HF trader on here a [few days ago](

[Bitbargain]( in the UK is awesome for this, but it isn't opensource.
Escrow is a very seductive and important feature when it can be trusted.

And then give to OP

Yeah I like this idea, and thought of including something like it in the post.
I think this would be a very interesting way to build protocols and coding for an exchange - kind of like a best practice in full view, able to be tested at the most initmate level for security holes.
Typing this, I realise that would be the "bitcoin of exchanges".
I also heard that Max Keiser is working on an exchange, but this could never happen or be so far away that it won't matter.

Yeah my plan was to research them (botnets)and watch a few interviews about them a bit later.
I guess there are way smarter people than me working on this right now (hopefully) and the best thing is that problems like this will make bitcoin adapt and grow even quicker, which will actually contribute to overall robustness of the web.

Yeah in a weird way the paradigm shift of bitcoins is being hampered with using old ideas to manage it (exchanges). I don't know what the solution is (maybe just lots and lots of exchanges), but thankfully this pressure will encourage many different solutions.

yah probably with one finger and the laptops in different rooms...

I'm not sure reading that article that the FinCen regulations are the cause of it.
But like I said, the reasons for this are mostly irrelevant and obfuscate the main issue:
We need distributed transactions for bitcoin to do what is does best (be distributed).
Before these exchange closures, it was easy to say "ok don't be negative about Mt Gox, just DO something and support the smaller exchanges."
This is not as easy to do anymore and we need alternatives.
