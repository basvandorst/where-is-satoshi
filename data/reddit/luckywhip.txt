Stay down until *right after* I buy then it can go up all it wants 
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:16:13
I know it will. I'm still waiting for my ID to be verified by coinbase at the moment :(
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:03:07
Same. I remember hearing about it being in the 3000s and I was so pissed it was impossible to buy at that point

But it needs to drop so I can buy more

Well I used my CC to buy on coinbase just because it was faster than using my bank account. But I pay my credit card off monthly  so I guess it wasn't really on credit. I only use my CC like that because I'm young and scared shitless of credit cards but my folks tell me it helps me build credit using it like that

Lmao my mom bought $100 worth about a year ago 
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:15:24
Yep, she bought in at ~10k so it was a little over a year. I asked her if she wanted to sell when it was around 18k and she said no lol
