People are going to do horrible things regardless of what currency, ideology and economic system they believe in. Doesn’t matter if the whole world agrees on one thing without argument; people will still commit atrocities.
Anyone who lumps cryptocurrency as a cause and effect for these things is too stubborn to ever adopt, they’re just gonna find another argument if their current one is rendered irrelevant.

Hahahaha that’s easy because I won’t need to change a thing. Just started working again after a painful 6 months of unemployment. Got like 10k debt not including 30k student debt to pay off too ��

What I’m saying is don’t take it too seriously

Oh fair enough, I didn’t know about that and just did a little reading and I agree that instance isn’t on. That’s the trouble with balancing big anything for profit food companies and science I suppose.

Agreed, when one party strays too far from what the public wants the other party knows all they need to do to stay in office is correct the mistakes of the last one. Not perfect but it stops the whole USA thing from happening

I mean fluoride in the water and GMO foods aren’t actually bad but sure, the rest I agree I’d distance myself from. Fluoride is good for your teeth and almost all food in existence is a GMO whether it be a banana (they were required to be genetically modified to prevent extinction) or the beef from the cow you eat being the result of selective breeding to breed the biggest cows. Most of the fear about those things being perceived as bad are the result of speculation and fear mongering from journalists and media stirring up bullshit for attention and clicks because anything to keep themselves relevant.
GMO sounds real big and scary big pharma until the potential prospect of genetically altering our genes to cure ourselves from dementia or Parkinson’s, then suddenly it’s wonderful... right?

Nah mane it’s all good from overseas it’s just something we kind of chuckle at because it’s just a minor inconvenience for anyone not actively interested in politics, it was kind of lose-lose anyway as soon as Bernie wasn’t an option. If the election was a WWE main event and I was the GM I’d have made that bad boy a fatal three way
