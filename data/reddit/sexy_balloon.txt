Ahh LN isn't even ready yet and the march to centralization already begins. Seriously how does anyone not see that this is literally centralization? 
Blockchain may not be controlled by governments, but exchanges CERTAINLY are. Just look at the market reaction to the rumour of China/SK banning exchanges. 
So if this the case, all any government needs to do is to seize one of the exchanges the the entire network cripples and people lose their coins.

To able to handle a significant amount of the transfer, yes absolutely hubs will have a large amount of BTCs. 
And what do you think will happen when a government take over one of these hubs with large concentration of BTCs (or get DDOSed)? Do you really think another hub can just pop up overnight with enough liquid BTCs to replace the hub that's taken offline? Where do these spare BTCs just float around in?
And nope airlines hubs are not formed because of regulations. It's due to pure economic forces that they evolve into hub-and-spoke model, the same economics forces that will turn the LN into a hub and spoke model like we're **ALREADY** seeing in this very thread.

Raiblocks pretty much trumps bitcoin in decentralization (in addition to speed and of course fee-less). 
There aren't even miners in it, every wallet has its own blockchain. On Bitcoin if you don't pay a high enough toll (tx fees) to the miners good luck having your transactions included. Even in LN you will rely on nodes that have to agree to forward your payment (in exchange for tx fees).
The miners and LN nodes are "decentralized" in that they aren't all the same entity, but this set up is much more centralized than Raiblocks' minerless system.
I agree with your thesis about all other alts though. Raiblocks is one of the very few coins that I think truly upped the game.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:11:29
If a hub get shut down by a government, LN loses x btc in transfer capacity. Because it's a hub, x is not trivial, and another hub is unlikely to have &gt;=x in spare capacity. Disruption ensues as many people lose the ability to transfer funds and forced to close channels incurring additional fees.
It's the same as if Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson airport shuts down and you see massive delays in a lot of flights. There aren't other airports that can simply absorb ATL's capacity.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:14:13
Can't speak for other "feeless" coins, but in the case of Raiblocks (which is hailed by r/cryptocurrency as the second coming of jesus christ), there is in practice a "fee" paid in the form of a small amount of PoW computation power that each wallet needs to perform to receive (or maybe send?) a transaction. 
This computation is needed to prevent spam attack, but otherwise there's no fee in the sense of any visible duductions from your holdings. 0.000000001 rais transferred will show up as 0.000000001. Additionally, there are no miners in the system that aggregates these transactions into blocks, since each wallet maintains its own blockchain, so no middlemen needed to pay a toll to.
This sounds good in principle, but I'm not sure how it will play out in real life. The fees are invisible, but they are there nonetheless in the form of higher electricity usage of running the wallets. I think these costs are trivial enough that most people won't register it, and the vast majority of people will think it's magically free.

I think you drank too much kool aid and you are extremely uninformed if you think the leading coins today are counterfeits of bitcoin.
Yes there are tons of shitcoins (cough LTC cough), but there are a handful of coins that have far surpassed bitcoin in technology and scope.
This shouldn't be a surprise to you as Bitcoin, with its codebased developed 9 years ago, is essentially unchanged save for some addons like segwig. For example, DAG-based coins aren't even technically blockchain anymore, that's how fast the rest of the crypto world has moved on.
Bitcoin will ALWAYS have the brand, because it started the revolution, but blindly following it without even educating yourself on what the rest of the world is up to (as evidenced by your comment regarding "counterfeits") will eventually make it like the Catholic Church: large number of faithful followers but of little importance in the day-to-day world

I think share of trading volume is a much more useful gauge of how important a coin is in the crypto space. There's a massive long tail of garbage coins that have next to no trading volumes with "market cap" of tens to hundreds of millions. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:38:38
I am aware of how LN works. But in your example, the total 1-way capacity of that channel between Alice and Bob is 0.1+0.1 = 0.2 BTC. If I need to send someone (not just Bob) 0.3 BTC, this channel will be of no help.
So it comes back to, unless you can predict the maximum cumulative 1-way transactions you will send (or receive) in the future, you'll need to close and re-open channel(s) over and over again. And who has the clairvoyance for that?

Thanks for the write up. It's a bit confusing but I made it through. 
Yes, it is correct that according to the textbook (that was actually one of my undergrad textbooks), the theoretical value of a futures contract is simply the spot price compounded by the risk free interest rate. Arbitrageurs in theory ensures this.
Your scenario A is one without an arbitrage opportunity, because the value of the futures is identical to the spot price compounded to 1 months from now at the risk free interest rate. Therefore, you start with 15,000 and end up with 15014.25, with a risk free interest profit of 14.25. In other words, you didn't make any **arbitrage profit**.
Your scenario B is the confusing one. In this scenario, you start with $0 you own. You end up with $14.25 you own through **arbitrage profit** (and $0 in risk free interest profit). If the futures contract in B was trading at -14.25 as you described in A instead of -28.5, you will end up with $0 arbitrage profit and $0 risk-free interest profit (so you start with $0 you own and also end with $0 you own). 
Your scenario A and B are not financially equivalent to each other. Scenario is A is no arbitrage, while scenario B is with arbitrage. You can't just take 2 scenarios with different derivative contract values (-14.25 vs. -28.5) on the same time horizon and say *...I made money either way and both times it was exactly $14.25*. Because the nature of the $14.25 are completely different in these 2 scenarios.
The rest of your write up is...confusing and riddled with inaccuracies.
* This: "...*selling lots of future contracts (shorting Bitcoin)*". 
Selling futures does not equal to shorting Bitcoin. Selling futures == shorting futures. Shorting futures =/= shorting bitcoin.
* Also this: "*So if you actually enable a low future price to drive down the current price of Bitcoin, you end up damaging the value of the asset you're hodling.*"
This is wrong because you already have a futures contract to deliver the bitcoin you hold. Any decrease in value in the bitcoin you hold is compensated by the profit you make from the short position you took on the futures contract. Your long position in bitcoin is hedged by your short position in the futures.
* And then this formula in your footnote: "*15000 * exp[0.0114/12]=15014.25*"
It should be 15000 * exp[(1+0.0114/12),1]=15014.25
You made the correct intermediate conclusion, which is that spot price and futures price are in lock step with each other, with risk-free rate as the compounding/discount factor. And overall, you asked the right question, which is if financial institutions hell bent on destroy bitcoin by shorting futures market can cause the price to transmit to the bitcoin spot market and tank it. 
 **But your final conclusion is not quite accurate** because you didn't address how such a transmission from futures market to spot market could *not* happen. 
Consider this scenario. Imagine bitcoin is currently trading at $15,000 like you describe. JPMorgan, as an evil institutional investor but not allowed to participate in the bitcoin market, heavily shorts the futures market, causing the bitcoin futures price to be below the theoretical price of $15014.25, lets say to $15005.00. A prop trader, who is not barred from participating in the bitcoin market, notices an arbitrage opportunity. This prop trader (with no cash of his own) then proceeds to borrows 1 bitcoin today and immediately sells it for $14,995, causing the price to drop from $15,000 to $14,995. Concurrently he takes a long position on the futures market for $15005.00, meaning that he agreed to take delivery of a bitcoin 1 month from now for this price. He proceeds to put the $14,995 he got from short selling the bitcoin into the bank which returns $15009.25 one month from now according to your formula and assuming 1.14% risk free interest rate. Then, also one month from now he takes delivery of that bitcoin for the agreed upon futures contract price of $15005.00, netting him in an **arbitrage profit** of $4.25. Finally, he returns the bitcoin to the party he borrowed it from, closing out his position. He not only made the arbitrage profit, but caused the bitcoin spot market price to drop from $15,000 to $14,995.
The key thing to note is that the prop trader was the transmission mechanism that enabled evil banks like JPM participating in the futures market to affect prices in the spot market, on which you and I all trade on.
**TL;DR The correct conclusion is that currently no one knows what's going to happen. I checked with some people; there's no study to show if spot price transmits to futures price, or futures price transmits to spot price.**

I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this because it's not the party line around here but there's one thing I never understood: 
You keep your coins on a centralized place like an exchange, you have the risk of seizure or their insolvency.
You keep your coins in your own wallet, you have the risk of losing your storage, or password, or keys.
Either way, there is some measure of risk of losing your coins; the question is which one is greater.
A common number that gets thrown around here a lot is that 1-4 million coins have been lost forever due to owners losing access to their wallets (lost keys or storage). If you believe this number, that makes the **risk of losing access to your wallet to be anywhere between 6 to 25%**, assuming 16 million coins currently mined and in circulation. This number seems to be much higher than all the "hacks" suffered by the exchanges.
So the rational conclusion seems be to keep your coins on the exchanges, because your chance of losing it on an exchange is much smaller than losing your coins on your own?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:29:04
It works the other way around too no? If the price differs to much, people will buy and sell futures until the price converges.
So my question is, is the future market going to affect the bitcoin market, or is the bitcoin market going to affect the futures market?

Shorting futures is very different from shorting the underlying market. The mechanism to short bitcoin itself hasn't changed just because there's now futures (meaning it's still difficult to short bitcoin).

The CME futures will be cash-settled, meaning at no point during the trade will anyone actually buy or sell actual bitcoins to settle. 
Personally I think this means that this market is just a betting market for institutional investors on where the price of bitcoin is going to be, without affecting the actual price of bitcoin (since no one is actually touching bitcoin).
If someone know about this more than I do, please help me understand if this will be the case or not. Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:54:11
Perhaps. But I think you're discounting how much of what people think bitcoin is worth is driven by what they see the chart is doing.
Because bitcoin can't be valued using fundamental analysis like discounted cash flow, if the price all of a sudden plummets 50% overnight, that plunge will cause a large chunk of the market to reduce their internal valuation of bitcoin (since there's no any other way to value it)
But you're right, a minority of the people being overly leveraged is not a threat. But we need to prevent that from becoming a large portion of people.

Hijacking my own comment, does anyone know if LN allows you to split your payments across multiple channels to send? 
For example, if I have 5 channels open with 5 other users, each with 10 BTC for a total of 50 BTC (for the sake of argument, I wish I had that much). Is it possible to send 30 BTC in 1 transaction, and the LN automatically splits the 30 BTC payment amongst all the separate channels? 
To take this a step further, if I'm acting as a node, and I receive a request to forward 30 BTC from one of my channels, is it possible for me to forward this payment even though individually my channels contain no more than 10 BTC but collectively has 50 BTC?
I'm not technically savvy enough to understand the code, and I couldn't find anything on Google, so I'm hoping someone can enlighten me on this.

hmmm the 2 key assumptions used in the simulation according to Diane's article, that everyone is connected with everyone else, and that everyone has an equal, "non trivial" amount of bitcoins on the LN, are pretty unrealistic.
To be realistic, the channels, coin amounts, and transfer amounts all need to be randomized based on some reasonable distribution (the coin distribution should probably be based on some sort of lorenz curve, everything else can be even distribution)

Even if everyone put 100% of what they own onto LN, there will be inequality in those amounts. Assuming all nodes will have same amount is completely unbelievable. And most BTC wallets today have very tiny amounts of BTC, so even if these wallets are migrated to LN they won't be "non trivial"

It helps that there's an income stream, but it honestly doesn't matter if there is or there isn't. Governments can deficit spend indefinitely with no repercussion as long as central banks manage inflation.
My point is that the $1.5 tln debt figure sounds scary to people, but it ultimately doesn't matter because when you own the ledger (i.e. if you control the money supply), the rules are different.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:59:38
Debt is not inherently bad if own the ledger. You and I can't take on massive amounts of debt because we don't own our ledgers, meaning if I have $100 in debt, I can't just say I also have $100 in assets, because no one will take my word for it.
If you're the central bank, taking on debt is not a bad thing, because you can simply say, I also have $1.5 tln in assets. Since their ledger is the ultimate truth in a country (all commercial banks have accounts with the fed), they can take on as much debt as they want with no repercussions, as long as they manage down inflation, and they have tons of tools at their disposal to do that.
The fed is even more privileged than other central banks, because not only do americans trust their ledger, other countries also trust their ledger.
