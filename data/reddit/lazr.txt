I made the same suggestion. My friend bought 6.

No...not really. Where's the benefit? There are tons of other materials better suited to make spoons. There's nothing gold can do that something else can't do better. In any case, is your argument for gold's superiority really that in a post-apocalyptic situation you'll be better off? Because if that's all you got, I think I'll take my chances.
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:48:35
Well...not really. If the question was never asked, then it would be unsolicited.

Your scenario would be more similar to

I bought silver from APMEX. It was super simple and didn't require a cavity search.

Similar to bitcoin...as well as many other things in existence. I'm well aware of gold's many uses, but I don't see what makes it have more *intrinsic* value than anything else. Gold is a jack of some trades, master of none. I completely understand why it's valuable monetarily, but I also understand why bitcoin is valuable -- you're the one making claims about gold's intrinsic value. Yes, gold is shiny and you can bend it into the shape of an object to shovel macaroni and cheese into your mouth, but can you send it to the other side of the planet in a matter of minutes? They both have their advantages, and they both have their disadvantages, but to say gold is superior simply because it is a physical object is an antiquated way of thinking.
Gold is coveted because it is *rare*. Is it super rare? No, not really. Are there metals more rare? Definitely. Are there metals with superior properties? Definitely. Is it the most coveted metal on Earth? Definitely not. As I mentioned earlier, though, rarity doesn't factor into something's intrinsic value, even if it does affect what somebody is willing to pay for it.
Sorry for being close-minded...perhaps in the distant future I can be more open-minded like you, when I'm paying for my tennis shoes with chunks of the mysterious shiny metal from my pocket.

Well, I apologize for being ignorant, but I'd love to know one thing that gold can do that something else can't do better. The only scenario in my mind where gold's intrinsic value comes in handy is in a post-apocalyptic scenario...otherwise, there's plenty of other options in terms of usefulness (especially if you actually want to make some spoons). But yes, I'm the insane one for thinking that gold isn't that magical just because it happens to be a shiny metal. Silver, being a better conductor than gold, has much more intrinsic value than gold - and it's shiny too! The fact that gold is more rare might make it worth more money, but its rarity is irrelevant when considering its intrinsic value.

The concept becomes easier to explain once the person knows that the dollar isn't backed by gold any more. A lot of people are unaware of this, but once you explain how currency in general works, bitcoin becomes easier to grasp.

Do you know what the word "anything" means? Good god, man. My reading comprehension has been perfect, it's your moronic comments that are the issue. You do realize that bitcoin is included within the group "anything," right? I said, "I don't see what gives gold more intrinsic value than *anything* else" and then you shot back that you *don't* think it has more intrinsic value than anything else, and now you're saying you think it has more intrinsic value than bitcoin? 
Ok, whatever, you don't know what certain words mean. Regardless, we've reestablished that you do think gold has more intrinsic value than bitcoin. Back to the question I've been asking, and you've been dodging -- why!? Why do you think it has more intrinsic value? Is it simply because it is a physical object? Again, keep in mind that something's monetary value plays no part in determining its intrinsic value. Also, keep in mind that how much something is "coveted" plays no part in its intrinsic value either, so I'm not sure why you insist on bringing that up in every comment. So, that whole argument is both irrelevent and inconsequential. Following this logic (which may be difficult for you), would you agree that silver therefore has more intrinsic value than gold? And if not, why?
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:59:48
I understand that...but to say it's the "definition of unsolicited" is stupid.
@_date: 2014-01-17 06:04:44
Buyers can do that with *anything*.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:07:31
Wait...you were never even trying to argue that gold has more intrinsic value than bitcoin? You did mention, although sarcastically, that wood has more intrinsic value because you can make a spoon out of it...I guess I was thinking that was how you were judging intrinsic value. But that just makes me more curious, what's the point of talking about spoons at all? You're just trying to make us aware that gold is a physical object? We're all aware, and I'm not sure why that's a positive. It's certainly not a negative, but there are plenty of physical objects that exist. And if you're now claiming that gold *doesn't* have more intrinsic value than bitcoin, why is it any better to have a currency backed by gold? Your whole point seems to be that gold is great as a store of value because it already has value, but whenever I ask you questions about *why* it's a good store of value, you just toss personal insults my way. "Because it always has been" is a terrible answer. "Cars will never catch on. People have been using horses for transportation for thousands of years." "Email will never catch on. People have been writing letters for thousands of years." Don't get me wrong, I know gold is a good, safe, and smart investment. I don't have anything against gold, which is why you don't see me in the gold subreddit bashing gold, but you've yet to tell me what makes gold so great. Yes, gold is here and always will be. Horses are still here too...

Sometimes I get the same thing on their site. Although, it's typically only if I'm using my phone.

I actually do use Simple for most of my banking (and it works pretty slick), but I hung onto my old account for when I need to do same day deposits, write personal checks, etc.

I'm guessing that must be it. It would've been nice for them to let me know.

I've been banking here for over 20 years, and they started charging me around 6 months ago. I guess I didn't have the foresight to predict what their fees would be like decades after I opened my account. Got any hot tips for me?

I recently switched my bank to  I wasn't happy with my bank and the $5 fee I'd have to pay every time I used the ATM. Simple has a better web interface as well (and pretty solid phone app). The main thing that encouraged me to give it a go, though, was how easy it was to make the switch. Any other bank would require me to go into the bank in person (as well as leave work early). It literally took me a few minutes to sign up. I'd be happy to send you an invite if you're interested. At the very least, you could use it just for your bitcoin/Coinbase transactions.

I guess it would apply to selling any digital item on eBay, as there's currently no protection at all for sellers. I sold a digital game coupon code (worth about $60) on there and sent the guy an eBay message with the code immediately. He said he never got it (I filed a dispute and went through that whole process). eBay didn't give a shit and said because I didn't physically mail him an item, I didn't hold up to my end of the bargain (even though the auction clearly stated nothing would be mailed). They then took the money out of my PayPal account. I got the coupon code free with some video cards I purchased, so I didn't really lose any money...but it's the principle.
I tracked him down and found out where he was living (a different address than what was listed on PayPal, so even if I had mailed him something, he wouldn't have got it). The guy filed for bankruptcy at some point and lost the house. I was planning on getting my money back (I found him selling an item on a tennis forum), but after a few days I didn't really care any more. I doubt I'd ever sell on eBay again after what happened with the game coupon code, though.

Apparently they can't use their messaging system as proof of anything. I sold a digital game coupon code (worth about $60) on there and sent the guy an eBay message with the code immediately. He said he never got it (I filed a dispute and went through that whole process after eBay ruled in his favor). eBay didn't give a shit and said because I didn't physically mail him an item, I didn't hold up to my end of the bargain (even though the auction clearly stated nothing would be mailed and the code would be delivered via an eBay message). They then took the money out of my PayPal account. I got the coupon code free with some video cards I purchased, so I didn't really lose any money...but it's the principle.
