This makes my blood boil. Bashing bitcoin is 100% fine and ok as long as you have a grasp on what it is. They think its going to be used as a currency and doesn't know if it could be split. Embarrassing to them and hurting the viewers. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:31:23
Doubtful that would be 16.5b at today price. And if an order ever went if for that much 825,000 coins. The price would explode an they would have to pay significantly more to hit that total
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:36
Get the pepper 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:50:36
147 in smart
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:58:44
No its laid out clearly what the split is. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:14:33
Wait, what price was 200$ at the time of this presentation?
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:19:58
Bitcoin is a great stock
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:08:40
Demand sky rockets and supply only gets smaller. Those chumps can fight over the remaining scraps (4M BTC) and we watch and HODL
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:28:12
I see there is a 10k limit with wire. Is that the cap
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:48:10
That was helpful thank you. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:05:14
No. not quite that much
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:34:40
Im sorry. But isn't it activated already?
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:28:39
Time doesn't matter. Just has to hit 500,000. My prediction 8 years. Just a guess everyone don't get hot and bothered. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:10:32
Ill give satoshi his first
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:14:39
Oh. Alrighty thank you for clarifying 
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:04:18
Clever idea. Unfortunately 3 letters on each show is what i could do and I thought “ Bit-Coi” looked funny

@_date: 2018-06-21 14:09:43
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:29:23
Im not following. Why would i scuff them?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:59:33
Im all for that, and I genuinely will donate. Which ever charity gets the most up votes ill donate too. Or my right nut. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:05:45
Awesome stuff. Just spent 66$. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:32:19
But there are monthly and weekly caps. I don't understand how to buy bulk
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:07:13
What was his count
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:25:49
I didnt sold
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:10
65,000. Oath
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:18
65k by dec next year. Or ill eat my right testicle. Or donate 200$ to charity, your choice. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:32:04
Fuck me , that was brutal.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:58:07
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:01:35
I said this meaning i wanted to know the answer aswell
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:32:47
Why shouldn't you mention bitcoin to the bank
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:13:37
Can u give a quick explicit on what the graph means. Im confused 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:14:07
Gold is worth its weight in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:26:20
Thats the no fee method. Everyone does it. Billion dollar company, so you can trust them. Btw a bunch of bitcoins?!? Ill send u my wallet for a tip if ud like :) 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:30:38
Cme delayed? Until when?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:05:58
For everyone. Ive never been given gold before. Its a Christmas miracle. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:21:03
In three years there will not be 21M coins mined. 17.5M which needs 8.75T market cap
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:27:40
Current market cap 76b/coin 16.5m =4606 which is just about the price it is at. At any given moment you can do the current cap/coin and it always equals the price, its always the case. Supply and demand. So there you go for trying to sound smart
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:48:41
So 450,000 roughly in 2018 ... I'm doubtful. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:56:53
Haha. Poped into my mind &amp; thought maybe the hodlers will understand 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:04:46
How insightful. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:09:19
Clear and to the point. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:22:01
 A boy can dream
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:11:52
Right. I literally had a nostalgic feeling. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:13:06
Lol cant wait
