just wait until the real economy is in a recession. Most people putting money into this don't have much capital and will be forced to sell because people on the bottom rung get squeezed the hardest. After all, we are in the longest bull run in the history of the American Stock exchange

The analysis showed that "substantially all of the volume" reported on 71 out of the 81 exchanges was wash trading, a term that describes a person simultaneously selling and buying the same stock, or bitcoin in this case, to create the appearance of activity in the market. In other words, it's not real.
