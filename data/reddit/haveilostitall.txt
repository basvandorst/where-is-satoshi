It's almost as if the complexity argument falls apart under the most basic scrutiny.

The tax code is unbelievably complex, and I promise it's being used to fund terrorism.

Can't get any simpler than complete abolishment.

Your comment reflects quite a bit of ignorance about transgendered individuals.  For the most part, it can be forgiven, since society as a whole largely ignorant of such matters, relegating us to daytime talk shows and punchlines in sitcoms.  That said, being transgender is not a "bedroom" issue...it's a *life* issue.
Your ignorance is perhaps forgivable in this case.  However, you have an opportunity to better yourself here, so should you choose to remain in that state, the blame lies solely on your shoulders.
Take care.

You're thinking about this too hard. Proverbs are little bits of wisdom that are meant to be good guidelines for the human experience... Not universal, all encompassing, infallible laws of existence.  It's just acknowledging the regret of missed opportunity in the past while encouraging action in the present, which is overall, a useful sentiment. Anyone could construct a mental scenario in which it would not hold true.

If you're patient enough to get verified, coinbase is good.  Time investment upfront, but fast once you're verified.

Not sure the vhs/beta analogy holds... there weren't public exchanges available to allow one to convert freely between formats.
That said, I'm still reading this post, and agree that litecoin isn't really helping anything.

This comment thread shows the diversity of the Bitcoin community... from transgender individuals to gigantic dickheads... Bitcoin touches us all.

Obviously... Why would *anyone* bother with anything less than an entire gold brick.  Anything less than 400 troy-ounces isn't even worth wasting your time on.

Too expensive?? 1mBTC is only a buck.  If you can't afford that, you should get a job before investing in cryptocurrencies.

Man... This guy should check out the tax code.  It's so complex, I *guarantee* it's being used to fund terrorism.
