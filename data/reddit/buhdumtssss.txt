It honestly belongs anywhere anybody owns any sort of cryptocurrency since this effects pretty much everything. But I'll post it there too

I can tell you exactly what it's going to do. It's going to fall to the next line of support, and then the next until it stops and volume rises for a breakout of the decending channel. Options and futures really have nothing to do with traditional charting so no shit you don't know any of this.
Nobody including me ever once said TA is foolproof, but if you know the signs eventually you can easily predict what a market will do. The only unforseen things are news driven events, which can affect price and to the layperson make TA seems "useless"

So I've done a lot of thinking about why the market is behaving like this. I've found 2 very concerning things. First, I highly doubt Bitcoin will complete this move. The volume has been steadily decreasing. I expect it to fall into that descending channel or drop completely; this is how I predicted the last move would fail. Secondly, just for the hell of it, I looked at the 1-week MACD, and to my surprise, the averages have just crossed which was what caused the crash we're in right now (and that was just the daily). 
I really hate to be that guy, I really believed in a comeback. But with the market so hopelessly attached to this dinosaur coin, and it being in such bad shape, I am extremely bearish. The shots it's taking at 11,600 are becoming more and more pathetic. To any trained eye, even if this goes anywhere it won't stay there long. What this market needs is a new anchor. Bitcoin is starting to choke.
Rule  of trading: volume determines price.

Cool then why are you even here? If none of this concerns you and you're holding it till $100,000 or whatever number, check the price once a year and forget about it. For the other 90% of us who take actual interest in their investments, those thinking of buying, or just the average investor in general, this shit matters. Holding from 12k to 8k for 3 weeks waiting for 12k again simply isn't a smart investment idea. a better one is just waiting until 8k and buying.
See what I'm saying? Literally nobody cares about your 10 BTC buy at 1k or whatever price you got it at.

I don't get it

Ive seen that chart many times, look at BTCs four hour graph and look at the chart and show me in what universe you think we're climbing up the slope. Institutional awareness phase? Lmao, I read an article months ago about a family mortgaging their house to buy Bitcoin. We're far past that, it's definitely squarly in the public domain. That's why it got overbought, that's why it's falling, and that's why we're in the "return to normal". This cycle will start over, but only when we return to market price which is 5-9k
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:42:09
Sure dude. in 2-3 more weeks once it stabilizes around 5-9k. In between here and there people will lose 40% of their investments and they should be informed.
Nowhere did I say this is the end of bitcoin, though it should have happened long ago.

Must've posted in the wrong place. I think the only thing this subreddit understands is lambo moon hodl. Just like the warning I gave the ripple subreddit before it dropped by 50%

To say what? It's going to continue it's downtrend? It's all but a certainty at this point, the market just proved like 4 days ago that you can't force something out of a channel it will just fall right back in

Since all the altcoins still can't decide how to react to bitcoin's moves, I wouldn't recommend trading anything at all right now. Some of them go up when it goes down, but most of them go down when btc goes either up or down and only really move when it's sideways. But indicators and patterns mean absolutely nothing when the market anchor is behaving like this. My TA is generally spot on, and I have missed the mark by miles simply because BTC moved a little bit. Unless you are watching your money every second it is in, you can lose 25% of it in an hour or two. I've tried swinging this market and it is Russian roulette. The smart money (probably the bankers who did all of this) got out on January 16th. That is why there's no more volume.

Lmao you're talking about overall adoption not awareness. By now a LOT of people have heard about Bitcoin. They may not own or use it but they've heard of it. 
Have you even looked at Bitcoin lately? That entire thing we just went through was nothing but mania. That shit was in Forbes  and MSNBC DAILY when it was peaking. If you're seriously linking me that chart and telling me that was the "first sell off" anything further you say I can't even take seriously anymore. I know for damn sure I wouldn't let you even near any of my charts, and that anything of value on them is completely lost on you.
Go ahead and pull up two windows, 1 with that chart and one with Bitcoin, let's say on the 4 hr. Put them side by side and go ahead and tell me how they line up and which point we're at.
Actually don't tell me because the answer is return to normal.

LTC came out of the box with segwit and lightning. State of the art fucking lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:08:56
That feel when Bitcoin hits 8k and he loses a quarter of it

@_date: 2018-02-08 22:53:38
I can't hear you over the sound of my TA
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:16:02
I see what you did there
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:22:56
