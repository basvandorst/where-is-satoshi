Isn't ARKK a Bitcoin Etf?
At least has an element of Bitcoin in there: Bitcoin investment trust GBTC

I feel for yours dude. Do you know the reason why I have to wait 5 days for .1 of a BTC, even though the money has gone through?
Reddit, what is a better, instant way to get BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:47:02
Haha. Having said all that, I really hope it goes well for you brother. Trust the comments, we all represent the same movement and you should consider yourself lucky and proud to be a key part of the front lines.

Taken from that article: "History tells us that China’s role in bitcoin is large enough to spook investors into selling."
Ya'll got spooked.
--Never panic sell, you only lose when you cash out like this, stay in and your value remains x.

Solution: view BTC a different way. Don't deal with charts, either hold on to it or use it to buy things. The value will always remain x until you cash out. And maybe it won't be adopted mainstream, but it will always be a thing as many businesses have already adopted it. Either buy things with it and be happy, or sit on it. Don't view it as a get rich quick event.
None of us know the capabilities. It is still a wee little baby and has many months/years ahead of its adolescence.

Don't be pompous or self-righteous. Don't seek fame nor glory, do it for the bitcoin. The meaning and feeling behind it. And don't fuck up.

Where else would one go for compiled news, information, and talk about the bitty?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:05:59
Yeah! Big bada boom!!!

Stellar slogan, I wish i coulda been there for the start of it all.. in actuality this is merely the beginning.. we're not too late!

Well it is a very exciting time not just about a new currency type deal, but one that has the potential to change the course of human history and give the power back to the people. If you are like me though you analyze all aspects and perspectives of the scenario and make an informed decision based off of all parts of the puzzle. This decision and point of view changes daily, but in a good way. Stay knowledgeable. Look at the bad and the good, to realize the whole.
r/bitcoin is one of the best places to gain insight through others who are here for the same goal. We share ideas, gain perspective, and ultimately inform others about each aspect to raise awareness of the coin (the only way it will succeed). It is like a brotherhood and we are merely at the beginning.
I love my bitcoin family.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:42:55
Would you be so kind as to explain how to get involved in that, I finally get the bitcoin thing, but bitcointip opened up a new can of worms. I'd very much like to get that tiny amount to actually see what an investment can do. Apologies, in advance if question sounds stupid. Hakuna Matata. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:24:33
I did this to the letter, better be safe. Still new, could you explain where to access the wallets made from bitaddress, how to access them through blockchain. Like how to transfer between the 3? Or is the secured one I made like an offline thing. Just confused on what to do next. 
Thanks man.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:03:47
I've gotten a bit deeper in the rabbit hole, thanks for looking out man. Awesome stuff, great information!

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:48:22
Thank you, a lot my friend. There was wine to be had tonight and that made complete sense, flawless in fact. If I had the bitcoins I would have tipped you for that. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:31:27
1) This was a general statement not r/bitcoin specific.
2) No bias, so many different opinions like the one you hold.
3) It is a brotherhood and I am Human, After All
Down voting my previous comment proves that people here have varying opinions, just like you! 
It also seems like you're only interested in it for the potential gain aspect, and not on the grounds that this could very well revolutionize the world in which we live, and propel us out of the 'grind'.
