The coin term is still stuck in media's head. They need to stop showing the same "coin" graphic on every news update. I swear reporters think you put them in your pocket. Sure you can stick a QR code on a coin and make it a bitcoin transaction.
Bitcoin is a private/public keys that store an amount on a public blockchain. Every transaction is viewable and traceable. The amount can be as small as one satoshi. 1 Satoshi	= 0.00000001 ฿
It's not complicated! Wallets just holds public/private key pairs. Don't loose your wallet and you will not get your keys ripped off. 
Want to invest? Create a new bitcoin account, transfer some bitcoin to the account. Print a paper backup. Laminate it and put it in a safe buried in the ground. Destroy your hard drive and then dig the safe up in 10 years.

Remember that the 1% sneeze billions. Manipulating the bitcoin market when it has a market cap of 6 billion is easy for them. See  for the current market chart. 
The important chart to look at is the Total number of transactions. It's accelerating. 
Keep the faith and go long.

Hookup your direct deposit from your job to send a fixed amount or % of your paycheck to send you bitcoin direct to your personal wallet through Bitwage.

You still have the same amount of bitcoin. Thats the thought you need to have in your head. Welcome to the roller coaster if you watch charts. Do your self a favor and just HODL.
