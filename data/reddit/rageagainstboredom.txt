Ahhh thats a good story too! Either way this dude needs to come up with a believable tale that ends with him having no bitcoins. 
A few years ago I spoke with a local millionaire and the stories he told me o_0 People actually got mad at him when he wouldn't just hand over money because they asked or if he loaned it to them they got mad that he expected them to pay him back. His house got broken into and he had a home invasion smh.

Took me about 8 times smh. I think they may have got tired of me emailing them everytime it didn't work. Upload your ID using a camera picture. The quality is usually better than a webcam. I took a picture of my license laying against a black background, sent them to my  comp and loaded them. When it asked for me to smile for the [web]camera I stood against a white wall.

What does OP stand for?
Siblings will be siblings lol. Unfortunetly she is the one gabbing to everyone. It's the people she tells and post to on Facebook that are the unknowns. 
I agree with the moral of his story. I was also offering a course of action that could improve his safety in the future when BTC goes even higher.

Are there any other exchanges that allow instant buys with a debit card?  If been using coinbase because it was the easiest to get money in the market. Then i just transfer it to my trading wallet

***BE PREPARED***
This sounds like the beginning of one of those "How The Lottery Ruined My Life"  stories you hear on the news where someone won the lottery and everyone around them changed and then started asking for money or plotting on them. 
Your Sister AND everyone she has told is counting your money.  People get robbed and snatched for less. 
Tell her your main wallet got hacked and someone stole it all. Youre only left with the pennies you had in old trading wallets. Pretend to be bummed for a few weeks then never tell her anything again.

Get creative. The good thing is they dont know exactly how much you have. Don't freak out.
