I Heart blockchain.info. I started with coinbase, QT, and now I'm feeling most secure and convenient w/ blockchain.info. The nicest thing are the aforementioned features, PLUS if it does go down they give you a backup that you can use with Multibit client.

I'm speaking generally here and not meaning to force the generalization on everyone but here goes. With all the libertarian talk on here about the negatives of the government and all that etc we can't just decide to selectively call on the government (FTC) to fix Bitcoin related problems in this new world we are trying to build. Either BTC will have to work with the Gov't or we have to build new systems to protect consumers and the BTC adopters involved outside of it.

I pre-ordered BFL in March, realized it was a joke, cancelled, got my money back with little fuss like 20 days later.

I foresee a trend like this. Bitcoin investors switch back to real-estate when it stabilizes/cash out. Having a roof over your head no matter what is real security.

Give yourself a Regular Maintenance Window! 24/7 Uptime is a great promise but if having a daily/weekly window helps you get 20/7 or something that would be even better. It would also help protect the market prices and people would be aware that it was coming and not see it as a sell flag.

As soon as Gox or Coinbase open up the LTC market then we'll all be able to roundtrip all day for a profit and therefore hopefully remove price differences between different exchanges. The LTC is the key to eliminating the USD element. It's a faster, safer, and quicker tool that would replace all the shady bank transferring.

Only for the last paragraph, and sorry if this is off topic, but when 19% of US gov't dollars goes to Military/War and 22% to social security which most people never get what they put in and 21% to medicare... I'm against MOST taxes because of mismanagement. If they weren't so high and used for so many things that aren't essential then maybe everyone would happily pay their share and ultimately have more for themselves and this wouldn't even be a topic of discussion.

It shouldn't be this hard guys. I'm 1000% for Bitcoin hoarding, adoption, payment system but securing them MUST be more accessible for people (it's not). As easy as logging into a website with 2-factor and have the confidence you'll be safe would be ideal. Its' too scary right now for the average person. It's getting even more scary as the value skyrockets.

BFL is the one to blame. Giving them to journalists and then these Cu*ts with impunity show off their misuse. 2BTC no biggie but if they keep on mining...

All transactions could be verified on the blockchain so that's fewer disputes eBay/Paypal have to be left holding the bag for. Yes it's one-way so that's some risk to certain parties but by having a system in place taking one-way into account it could be a big win.
