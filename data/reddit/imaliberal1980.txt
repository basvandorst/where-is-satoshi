The internet also had zero competition. Bitcoin is competing with the entire worlds financial markets. Adoption will take longer

How can you be pro decentralization with cryptocurrency then be for socialism which effectively centralizes the power in a country
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:35:18
I would say compared to other systems capitalism decentralizes power, or else all these companies would be run under the umbrella of a government structure. Theres always the danger of over centralization of a corporation.... aka a monopoly..... but there are also laws in place to deter that, they just need to be enforced effectively which ill admit they really arent..... but thats once again a flaw with the government.
