People will always be people. And the main rule of people is either you are being fucked or you are doing the fucking. If you think bitcoin or any other form of money or anything else will change that you are in fairy land. The same way bankers rob the regular folk, crypto wales will rob those who have less. 
The former at least drives innovation. In fact I’ve explained how crypto wouldn’t exist without it. And you and me wouldn’t be having this conversation on reddit. 
You truly don’t want to be a banker’s slave? Hand in your phone, your wifi router, your gps etc. and then we can talk. (Oh wait)
People just expect this shit for free. Well it isn’t, and it will never be. Just like every action equals a reaction, you will always have to pay to receive something. If you receive something first, you will pay for it later. That’s essentially how our financial system works.

This shallow “bank bad, inflation bad, fractional reserve bad” view all over this and other crypto subs needs to go away. 
How do you think society made the technological advances you mentioned? You know the computers, the internet etc.? Ever wonder why it was the US that came up with the majority of this stuff in the past 30-50 years? I’ll give a hint, it’s something that other countries didn’t have: federal reserve. 
The ability to make money out of nothing, and lend it out to the government and businesses while letting future generations pay for it with inflation is the greatest stimulus to our technological progress that there has ever been. 
You can be sure we would not see computers or internet or mobile phones and therefore not something like bitcoin for hundreds of years if it wasn’t for the fractional reserve banking and the fed. 
Look at other countries that stuck with the gold standard or something similar. What technological advancements did they bring to the world? Are there anywhere near as many as the US? The only country I can think of that cake close is the USSR, through communism which basically also robbed people through a different idea. 
There is no progress without lending. There is no progress without fractional reserve and what basically is a controlled pyramid scheme being held together on only by the ever increasing population. We’ve been there before. For thousands of years. Thinking of utilizing bitcoin as some digital gold or whatever you guys think is a step back. It’s only real use stems from its decentralization but no one knows how much this means it’s worth. 
So stop complaining about inflation. Yeah the price of bread has increased. But whereas 20 years ago you had bread, today you have a smartphone with 100x more computing power than first spacecrafts. Smartphones with more information inside them than any one person throughout history has ever had. Impressive? And I haven’t even scratched the surface. You pay for all this with the 2x inflation in bread price. Seems fair to me.

Think of it as betting on what the price will do. 
When you go long you bet that the price will go up. 
When you go short you bet that the price will go down. Going long and going short are the exact opposite of each other. 
Technically you are always either long or short. Say you bought some bitcoin and are just holding it - you are long - you are betting the price will go up. If you are not a bitcoin holder you are short on it - you are betting it will go down (because if you didn’t then why don’t you buy it and make money?)
Anyway some exchanges allow you to leverage your position by lending you funds. This means your 1 bitcoin can become 10. So you can make money or lose money faster. When you lose all of your position you get liquidated (so that the exchange doesn’t start losing it’s money).
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:30:28
Even if that’s true. Having 1 bitcoin is better than having 0,01. Those who trade try to turn their 0,01 into something more.
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:07:55
You are missing the point. Say you have only 100$ to invest in bitcoin (which is true for a lot of people). Even if in the next ten years the price goes 10x (that’s a big if) you will only have made 900$ by holding.. in 10 years.. 
Of course those people will be willing to leverage trade.

What do you mean hacking is impossible? Exchanges have been hacked, yahoo has been hacked, Apple iCloud has been hacked and they have a better security than an average computer. If you store the private key or any passwords on your computer, the attacker won’t have trouble finding them unless you take precautions. 
As for finding someone irl from reddit it is possible even just by looking at their posts and comments if the person is not careful. 
I’m not saying there is a huge chance but why would you take the risk of losing an enormous amount of your money just so you can how you said ‘brag’ about it on the internet?

This news in itself doesn’t mean any money will flow into bitcoin. It is simply a way for investors to make a bet on the price, and settle it in USD. 
However Bitcoin becoming more accepted and mainstream as a result of this will make more money flow in due to new users.

The position size is the amount that you buy or sell. 
So typically when you buy or sell with your own money you use what’s called a 1x margin. You bought 10000$ worth of bitcoin with your own money. If it goes up to 15000$ you gain 5000$. It goes down to 5000 you lose 5000, pretty simple. 
Some exchanges allow you to do what’s called leveraged trading. This means your margin can be 10x or 20x or even 100x. With the example above if you wanted to open the same 10000$ position you don’t have to risk all your money, you can use 1000$ your own money and borrow 9000$ from the exchange. That would be 10x margin. When you close the position you have to return the 9000$ borrowed (plus some commission) but you get to keep all of the profits. So if the value of the position increased to 15000$ you still get the 5000$ of profits (even though you used 10x less money than in the first example). 
So it’s basically a tool to increase the size of your potential profits when you don’t have enough money (or don’t want to risk all of it). 
However you must remember that if the trade goes the opposite way, you will lose your money much quicker the higher your leverage. At 100x leverage the price of BTC has to move only around 30 usd right now in the wrong direction for you to lose your money. That’s called liquidation price and is essentially what happened in the tweet. 
Edit: you can use [this ]( online calculator to get an idea of what its like to trade with leverage.

Be careful about sending your holdings bit by bit, your wallet has to support that. If it’s an old school wallet or a paper wallet where you have just one address and one private key you will lose the rest of your holdings unless you send it out all at once. 
Edit: and btw I would delete this post and never write anywhere on the internet about how much BTC you have. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:52:55
No, the position is liquidated before you get to ‘owe’ them any money. That’s the whole point of this liquidation thing, it’s like a stop loss for the exchange, so that they can’t lose money on your trades. As soon as your part of the position is lost the trade is closed or liquidated. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:50:43
Someone could figure out who this person is in real life - this wouldn’t be too difficult even for a non-hacker, and force this person to give away the private keys. If it’s an amount that is worth 100k+ you can bet there will be plenty of people wishing to give this a go. This also attracts hackers who can try and steal it remotely.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:55:21
Probably not because they had for sure used leverage. And given the price increase wasn’t that big it was probably a close to 100x leverage. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:07:43
You misread. 2 ways: 
First someone finds out who you and steals it without hacking. 
OR 
Second: someone who doesn’t give a shit who and where you are will try to steal by hacking. It’s been done before, do inform yourself. 
I don’t understand why you are arguing? If you feel there is no way for this to happen then brag away. It doesn’t hurt to be safer though. You don’t write on the internet how you have millions of dollars under your bed so why would you say you have a lot of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:48:47
No it’s not. Ferrari was its own company at first, then Fiat bought controlling share, then Fiat sold it, then Exor bought it. 
It’s like if hypothetically Facebook bought Instagram, then sold it to Buffet who also owns some Facebook shares. Facebook doesn’t own Instagram in that scenario.

You pay this commission for your money being safely stored and cashed out anywhere, any time, in any major city. I’m not sure what the confusion is here, anyone can store their money under the bed and never pay any fees..

Buy “play on the market” you surely mean give it out as loans which is basically the reason world economies boomed in the past half century allowing for rapid technological advancements such as internet and the device you are typing this from. Oh and the banks pay you for that too.

I’ve had a suspicion this would happen for a while. 
A country will never embrace such a risky asset without at least some regulation. I don’t think a completely decentralized future that we were promised for bitcoin is possible in today’s world.

This is so misleading. 
Where do you think we would be if not for the current economic idea? If not for debt and fractional reserve we wouldn’t have iPhones, internet, reddit and many things you use every day. 
Yeah it’s a circlejerk. But it’s one that works. And owe it for that. If we stop this and go back to gold standard the worldwide technological progress and growth will just stop.

You are wrong. It's perfectly ok to feel regret of past purchases of something that kept its value with something that has gone up in value by 1000s of %, especially when that wasn't your only payment option. 
It's basic portfolio finance to get rid of assests that are losing value (fiat currency with its inflation) and keep the assets that are gaining value (in this case bitcoin). Granted no one had a clue how much value bitcoin would gain 7 years ago hense the regret of making this financial mistake. A mistake of keping a sum of fiat that has lost its value and spending bitcoin that has skyrocketed.
Im not saying spenidng BTC on small purschases was a bad thing and that it didn't help the system because that's a different discussion. But would most people hold on to their bitcoins instead of buying pizzas in 2010 if they knew todays price? Hell yeah, and you can't blame them.
