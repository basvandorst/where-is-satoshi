Not sure what the Facebook chart is for.  Considering this story has nothing to do with facebook.
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:55:16
hahaha, this is great!
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:27:06
Sort of a different topic though... 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:04:22
Thanks you
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:04:36
Thank you :)  Makes sense
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:03:52
You read wrong.

Neatest thing about iPod is:   The first gen ipod touch had Bluetooth in it from the start.  
Apple (one year later) decided to activate the hardware inside so that Bluetooth would work with headphones, speakers, etc. etc.
It was only for some NIKE bu115hit at first.

Nobody cares about 'opalcoin' -never even heard of it actually.  And ripple?  Dude... Ripple?
You ignored the altcoin with any actual promise: Litecoin.

Please don't promote Bitcoin kinetics.
Try sending an email to the CEO, and just see if he responds.   Ask him what happened to the Bitcoin kinetics shares...
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:35:56
I wouldn't trust that guy with a pile of shit.   What happened to the Shares of bitcoin Kinetics?   They vanished.  He doesn't answer emails.
Don't promote his crap.
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:37:21
Don't trust him.  Just try emailing him about his Bitcoin Kinetics shares....  I bet you don't get a response.  I think he is a scammer.  But idk.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:44:58
Wow!  I showed up on time for once :D
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:47:44

I contacted Amazon (one of the companies claimed by Garza to be working with Garza) regarding the companies working together.
This was the reply I received:
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:10:28

Thanks Bruce

Click on the announcements tab.
It is all very odd.  
No emails were ever sent out to the 'share' holders, as was stated would be done.
Trying to contact Morgan Rockwell regarding the new KSHARES gets you no reply.

Oh man, too bad changetip doesn't allow you to just take money from somebody like that.
