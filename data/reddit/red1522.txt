$6000 is nothing to some people. If they were an early adopter it possibly means even less to them. You severely underestimate the attack on bitcoin. That said, read the rest of my post. I'm not saying it's a for sure thing.

Most likely done on purpose as just another form of bitcoin FUD. If not, feel bad for that person. Would be nice if miner would return it. That said, probably done on purpose.

And they will brigade this sub and downvote this post so no one sees it.

Wow. Brigaded by shills if course.

Most of those were fake by people who purposefully sent transactions with low fees during their own spam attack.

Obvious FUD. Of course we can still buy and sell bitcoin.
