When did you try? I've tried 50+ times since wednesday. Haven't gotten in once. The amount of laptop selfies I've had to take...
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:52:55
It's not a mining fee, it's an "additional fee", which I think is because of the fact that I have 2FA on the wallet.
Based on this: 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:35:15
Decided to put my BTC into an electrum 2fa wallet. Didn't realize that when withdrawing it I would have to pay $40 worth of mBTC in order to withdraw because of the fact that it has two factor authentification...any way around this fee or to change the wallet now or did I fuck up?
Edit: I'm seeing that you can pay once every 20 transactions. I assume this means that this $40 worth of mBTC will cover my next 19 transactions as well?

Good to know, thanks

How much $ in fees would Coinbase take if you sold, say, .04 bitcoin right now? 
I have a coinbase account but just cannot get onto GDax. I can't sell on GDAX even if I have a coinbase account until they confirm my identity, right?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:05:13
What if someone gifted you bitcoin and you sold it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:05:47
I'll have to keep trying then. I was under the impression that they just weren't getting to my identification at all, not that my ID was getting rejected. But I could very well be wrong, I'll have to re-take my ID pictures and try again, thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:32:50
Any sort of time estimate for how long 134 blocks/33 blocks could take?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:05:45
What site is the cheapest to sell BTC on and not get fucked by fees? Need to go from Site A -&gt; Blockchain -&gt; Selling site

Yeah, realized this shortly after. Thanks!

I already own the bitcoin and it is now in the electrum wallet. I'm trying to send it to my GDAX account now
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:28
How would I do this?
Edit: I think I found the option. But would I not lose the bitcoin in there when restoring it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:49:06
I don't think you'll be able to do that right now though unless your ID has already been verified with GDAX. Which is virtually impossible to get done right now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:17:17
They want to use my webcam which is kinda sketchy, no?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:58:35
I had to download the google authenticator app for it
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:00:24
It's just to confirm your form of ID
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:06:59
Yeah so does Electrum, which to me is absolutely ridiculous that it would cost that much to use a free app. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:47:06
How are their fees?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:07:07
What would you recommend setting the price at for a faster transaction? Like 100 sat/byte?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:10:33
Any other alternative? I've been trying to sign up for GDAX for almost 36 hours now and I can't get my ID confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:07:03
Originally purchased, or originally gifted?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:36:54
Yeah I realized this afterwards. I tried taking pictures of my ID, and it says it takes 3-5 minutes but can usually take longer and it's not at 50 minutes. Last time it went to 30 and nothing happened. Any advice?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:35:03
I'm wondering the exact same thing
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:34:56
Still not letting me sign in sadly
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:23:49
I can't even log in to my Coinbase account. Wtf is up
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:40
Is coinbase still down? It's not letting me sign in saying my e-mail/password is wrong even though I know for absolute fact that it is going in correctly
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:41:39
So even if they say "our banking partner" I should still call my bank?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:31:12
So if I send bitcoin from my blockchain account to someone, what are these 3 confirmations? How fast are they usually processed?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:34:44
I would have to imagine. Apparently they have to be confirmed by miners to it can take a while considering the mass number of transactions going on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:40
You think that BTC is going to drop from $10k to $800? Wouldn't that be the lowest price in years...?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:20:37
"Unfortunately your transaction has been canceled by our banking partner."
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:09
 This is what I've been using all day, don't really know a whole lot
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:36:41
After you send Bitcoin to someone, how long does it usually take to be confirmed? Been about 2.5 hours now
Edit: Through Blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:55:05
Whatever you say, @_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:59
Is this good news or bad news
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:54
Just bought some BTC on Coinbase using a card. It says it's supposed to be instant, but I haven't gotten anything yet, been about 7 minutes. Should I be concerned?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:07
Just got banned from logging in for a few hours because I "tried logging in too fast" because they weren't letting me log-in...
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:42:26
I figured it out had to call my bank to remove a block on my card. The price rn is lower than where I bought at yesterday so hopefully coinbase gets it figured out soon!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:32:03
It said "Unfortunately your transaction has been canceled by ***our*** banking partner."
Doesn't that mean cancelled from their end?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:29
Welp got an e-mail saying the purchase was canceled. That sucks
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:18:28
So I will be able to make the purchase again using the same card even though the price has gone up? Sorry, still getting used to all this
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:25
Welp got an e-mail saying the purchase was canceled. That sucks
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:08:19
Will have to do a completely different purchase right? I bought at $9600 now it's back up to $10k
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:40
Don't be stupid. Hold while you can. Putting all of your savings into anyone one thing is a fucking stupid idea to begin with and now you know that. ESPECIALLY something as volatile and unpredictable as cryptocurrency.
