you don't get it the guys are going to pay your bill if you give them bitcoin and the information that they need to pay it. I did the searche for you:  is the first suggestion in the list I don't know if they actually really pay the bill but I think they do.
And again if you want to get the usd in your bank account and then send them somewhere else you will pay fees.

They have many different ways to send them in limbo for a while. Take a look on reddit you will find many different story.
Never sell your bitcoin especially in a bull run orchestrated by Chinese bull that dump litecoin.
If you sell them the traditional banking system will take the half just for transfer them twice. Once to receive them and once to use them. So you have better time to spend them like they are in btc.

Paypal are going to steal the money from you and you will loss your btc.

What a fresh meat, you don't seem to know what happen when you sell ltc/btc. You are creating arbitrage opportunity in the btc/usd, ltc/usd, and every other shit coin markets. Opportunity that are filled very fast. That's why everything surge when the Chinese bullpanda whale litecoin ponzi pumper dumped from $9 to nearly $3.
