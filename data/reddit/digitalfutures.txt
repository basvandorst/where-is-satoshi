Charitable giving is still one of the biggest uses of Bitcoin.

I use Coinapult to store my bitcoin and I use locks to ride out drops in Bitcoin price. It cost me £1.60 to Lock three Bitcoin which I was pleasantly surprised by as they advertise 1-2% spread for locking. I also use them to email Bitcoin to friends- it is ridiculous simple to use and makes them a wallet. I haven't used the API yet and I am waiting for the QR code scanner to arrive. Other than that, I've found their customer support quite responsive. Hope this helps.

Cubits.com has near instant confirmations. It's a really friendly interface and You can also buy and sell within it if you want to show that. Verification is via SMS so really quick, like 5 mins. Well done for bringing Bitcoin into the classroom! Wish I had a teacher like you, back in the day

I'm not reptilian, last time I looked, and I don't like burgers so I should be OK

I agree with you - so what do you do when you're not one of those people. You are mentally displaced from the society around you because none of it makes sense to you. Y'all want to reference Matrix, well Neo got it easy, he got out the instant it dawned on him and got a new purpose- flying spaceships and shit. But we are waking up on the inside - that sucks more.
