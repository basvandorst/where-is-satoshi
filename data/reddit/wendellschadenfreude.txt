Yes, but if the price they agreed upon was in dollar, nobody would ask: "What if the dollar drops relative to the euro, or relative to bitcoin, or relative to whatever...?"

What loss? It's still the same amount of bitcoin.

You buy bitcoin at an exchange. (You also pay some small fee for that, usually a percentage, maybe 1% or so, but that's not the fee everyone is talking about.) If you simply leave them there, you're fine, but you have no actual control over your bitcoin, and you can't use them for anything.
To use/spend them, you need to send them to a "wallet" you control - e.g. a small programm on your computer. That transaction has to be processed by the entire bitcoin network. At the moment, there are always more transactions pending than the network can actually handle, so the "miners" get to pick whichever transactions they like best - and those are the ones that include a fee for the miner. This fee often has to be several dollars at the moment if you want your transaction to be processed any time soon.

Well, gold *is* great for financing mobsters and terrorists, avoiding taxes and hoarding money out of sight of your spouse.
Most people who use/own gold don't do any of that, but it *can* be used that way if you want to. Just like Bitcoin.

PayPal defnitely isn't "the most established payment system in the world". If you don't accept cash as a "payment system", that would still be Visa.
[PayPal's total payment volume]( per year is about $400 billion. [Visa's is about $7 *trillion*.](  
(By that measure, China's UnionPay is even larger than Visa. But given that it's much newer and so regional, I wouldn't count it as quite as "established" as Visa.)

That really tells you nothing about the distribution of bitcoin among *people*.
You can easily have hundreds of addresses that you used a single time and that are empty now, while all of your remaining Bitcoin are at one single address.

OP thinks that Bitcoin Cash is an obvious trap that lots of people are still falling for, because people aren't better at recognizing "people traps" than bears are at recognizing bear traps.

That is true, if you send your new bitcoin to your own wallet immediately every time you buy some.
Even if you believe in "not your private keys, not your bitcoin", it's just fine to wait until you have a significant amount of money in an exchange before you tranfer it to your own wallet.

Yes. And the most recent blocks show that it's definitely possible for miners to make enough money of only transaction fees, even when there no longer are any block rewards.

Let's say: it's just as easy to invest $100 into Bitcoin as it is to invest $100,000. The fees (a least at some exchanges) are calculated as a percentage, and they are quite low. (&lt;1%)
If it goes to $10,000, you'll have made ~10%, no matter how much you've invested. If it goes to 0 (also still possible), you'll have lost everything.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:27:09
That's not a bitcoin term, but a general investing/stock market term.

Coffee. People on this sub argue that bitcoin shouldn't be used to buy your coffee every day, or at least that it's not important for bitcoin to be able to support that use case.
Selling your truck for thousands of dollars' worth of bitcoin is an entirely different use case.

The "21 million club" means that you own 1 bitcoin. The name is because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, so if you own one of them, you are a member of a "club" that will only ever have at most 21 million members. (Realistically: far fewer, of course.)
1 BTC is worth about $8,000. Owning $8,000 doesn't make you rich.

Am I understanding correctly that this guy paid a fee of $5,500?

If we ignore their advice with regards to Bitcoin, is the rest really bad? In what ways?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:34:46
Absolutely not.
If it became known that even just *one* of the big institutional holders of gold were trying to sell all of their gold, the price would plummet.

People can also decide to start using copper the way gold is used. Exact same functions as gold (as a currency), except that it's far less rare.

If they want to get paid by a *specific* newspaper or channel, they better conform to that organisation's guidelines. That's a given that's true in every country ever.
But there are news organisations for every reasonably possible viewpoint and a few more than that in America, and every journalist from Breitbart or Infowars to the HuffPost and Buzzfeed can write anything they want without any fear of repercutions from the government.

Ok, but did I capitalize each word? And should I include the periods behind "correct", "horse", and "staple"? Why no period after "battery"?
Dammit, my password is still too complicated.

In Russian, journalists who criticize the government live dangerously. 
In America, most journalists at the moment furiously attack the government, while some stubbornly defend it. All of these journalists can feel safe and are free to write whatever they want.

That has nothing to do with it. 
People who leave their bitcoin on exchanges typically don't use any leveraged trades.

That's already figured in - he's no comparing the value of his bitcoin to 2014 dollars, but to (comparably slightly inflated) 2016 dollars.

Because that's what "we" call µBTC (Microbitcoins).
1000 µBTC = 1 mBTC
1000 mBTC = 1BTC
[Use "uBTC" if you can't use "µBTC" - simply because they look similar.]

Absolutely not.
The point of bitcoin is being a global, useful, safe *currency*. People are meant to use it that way, to pay for goods and services.
In the long run, BTC isn't more interesting as an investment than any other currency. But *as a currency* rather than an investment, it will always have advantages over $ and €.
