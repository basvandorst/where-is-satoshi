Why did you post it today? Wait until the halvening.
@_date: 2016-03-29 08:35:10
Write and ask for it. They'll reconsider if enough people ask for it.

Winkdex takes the price from the three biggest exchanges, by volume. Volume has been so low on the usual ones that localbitcoin got into the top 3, which affected the price shown. Magic.

About the image: Sweden, Denmark and UK are not in the eurozone
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:36:00
They are part of the EU, but not eurozone

I’m pretty sure we’ll see 10x long before that

Circle is good too

See there's your problem - read it only once

It's a messaging app for ios that uses open source end-to-end encryption. Snowden recommended it.

Another consideration is that it might slow down your internet connection. I don't run one myself, can anybody tell me if this will be noticable or what?
@_date: 2015-08-09 00:10:08
I agree
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:24:17
Is it true that taxpayers can't pay more? I mean could we really 6 years ago?
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:36:11
I have to say this was pretty tasteless. That's a picture of 7 people dying.

Everybody, please use the Signal app

Dude, it needs a [neon sign](

I agree. I read some report that said that the lack of legal guns makes the price of illegal guns so much higher, and there are just fewer of them around. Also criminals might be less prone to bring a gun if they don't expect to be opposed by one, but that's just me guessing.

In Germany you don't have to worry about it if you held the bitcoin for more than a year.

Buy drunk, sell sober.

[Link:]( "Back in June, the German government stated that Bitcoin trading would be subject to capital gains tax (...) At the same time, Bitcoin users shouldn’t be taxed if they hold Bitcoins not to trade but to buy stuff. **That’s why tax gains won’t be taxed if you hold your Bitcoins for more than a year.**"  
  
That said, I probably just won't tell anybody when I start selling off mine.

Another happy Armory user checking here

This may be gentlemen

The link to see the amount in the pool at the moment doesn't seem to work, can it be fixed?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:55:10
I never liked the 2600's anyway
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:52:40
Nope, but no biggie really

Lite mer svenskt än danskt tycker jag :)

I use Signal for all nsfw stuff when I talk to my gf
@_date: 2015-10-13 07:41:54
Yeah, wth. I'm running it as we speak.

This is partly why I refuse to print - I handwrite all my paper backups on acid free paper.
