Actually online poker was bigger than ever after the law went into effect. It wasn't until they shut down the 3 largest online poker sites 4 years later that it really hurt the market.

I think people are concerned that the people running Tether are printing Tether without USD backing (like they claim) and then buying BTC which causes the BTC price to rise. If this ends up being true, BTC investors might wonder how much of the Tether buying was fraudulent and used for manipulating the BTC price.

Right, but if people do begin exchanging BTC for shitcoinx (like they do with Tether) and then shitcoinx is found to be a scam, BTC investers will know that you put in $1T of fake money into the market which may cause people to lose trust and thus sell their holdings.

Bitconnect wasn't used solely as an exchange medium for other cryptos with the promise of USD backing. Presumably when there is a buy order for $1M of Tether for BTC, that is equivalent to a buy order of $1M USD for Bitcoin.

It's all about market confidence. People might wonder how much of the fraudulent buying caused the BTC price to go up.

USAA links to your Coinbase account and shows your crypto holdings when you log in.

BTC at $50k would be a $870B market cap alone. The total crypto market cap would have to be $3T+ to see BTC at $50k if history is any indication.

It depends on how much you're buying. Say 1 BTC is $10,000 and you are going to buy .01 for $100. If you waited for BTC to drop $500 to $9,500, .01 BTC would now cost $95. 
So waiting for a $500 drop in BTC saved you $5. Probably not worth it.
If you are buying in $1000+ increments on the other hand, timing it right could save you a lot of money. 
If you plan to hold BTC for the long term and think it can go to 6-figures+, then just buy now and forget it.
