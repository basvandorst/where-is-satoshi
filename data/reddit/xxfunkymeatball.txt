He feels it is something he feels that he did very well on; wants his good work recognized is all
Kinda like being called a cheater(which personally offends me deeply) then later going out of your way to prove the accuser wrong

While this may be a salary overestimation that I know not much about, they do get several week long breaks not to mention the summer break each year and dear lord the benefits. +(depending on the subject) the teachers don't have to worry about any unexpected curves (ie: curriculum, misunderstanding students)
disclaimer; I am not saying that teachers are *all* creativity slaying machines, with so many teachers needed there are bound to be people that don't care for their field. I have had quite a few teachers that are open-minded thinkers, lovingly enjoy their jobs, and realize what a huge role they play in our current society.   
EDIT: forgot their benefits

Good point! 
That is how almost all persuasive essays tend to sound up into 9^th grade; just another thing that is forced down our throats'

I disagree, through virtual schools teachers have almost no "real" connection to their students like facial expressions, mutual understanding, and personality. 
That being said, you are definitely right about how great it would be if all children could receive any education, I think nearly all people with computers  and a decent internet connection have access to education.

Going lawyer *mode* is quite different from *getting* a lawyer.
They only mean that he should take matters into his own hands and using his available resources to give his teacher no choice but to grade his paper.

I agree; probably a bad investment for now and the future with the current demand of real teachers dropping and use of virtual schools sadly rising. Thus increasing the amount of students a teacher can handle within a class and decreasing the demand for teachers(of which the supply is already too high)
