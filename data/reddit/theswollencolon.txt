I deposited 20 bucks 30 minutes before the announcement at chase. Why was the account still accepting deposits.

Not if people will accept. This is just what every exchange should do. I'm not even doing business with exchanges unless they advertise this.

This write has no idea what he's talking about. He is depending on his readers not knowing either. This obviously shows he has a personal vendetta against bitcoin and I wonder why. Since he mentions "the libertarian wetdream" or whatever, then I am guessing those are his motivations.

There is no way he made enough profit to hire security personnel or pay 20k for an eval. But still a good calk on your end.

Wanna know what truly determines the price of bitcoin? Supply and demand. Gotta get more merchants accepting it to get more people into it. I believe it has the potential to get real big, real quick with a major online merchant accepting them. For this to happen though, there will need to be major security fixes. Otherwise, if you keep the demand the same(no increase in user base) but increase the supply (asic and such), it would drop.

Piece of what?
@_date: 2012-08-10 05:35:35
The most paranoid thing i can think is if you have multiple items shipped to you and they stakeout you taking them. Most people order personal amounts so its probably a waste  of time and money to bust buyers. And dealers have to be near impossible.

@_date: 2012-10-08 02:52:30
There are other ways to gwt them that are cheaper. It's called competition and supply and demand. And whose fault are the ponzi schemes really?

Thanks for posting this. I thought that 20 was gone forever. I got on there znd bout 1.6 bitcoins. It would have gotten me 2 when i deposited, but oh well.

No i know, but it wasn't his money he lost. 12 years old shoudnt run big businesses and people need to be leary who they keep their money with.

Why are you the way you are? There is so much i hate... About the things you choose to be. 
@_date: 2012-12-31 03:05:00
The flaw of this argument is the assumption that bitcoins are the sole currency. Price of coins are determined by supply and demand. Supply will be determined by the selling and spending of bitcoins. Demand will be determined by the perceived value and usability. Equilibrium will always be found. Sometimes saving will be encouraged while selling and spending will sometimes be determined.

COINBASE! It's easy and works great. Also very cheap fees. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:44:27
Unless it dips back to 10 and people start losing 70 dollars a coin.

I see you liked my idea the best. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 06:18:15
But isn't there unlimited addresses. I mean, when you do it offline, aren't you just generating a random key?So how can a key(address) that has been generated offline be public record? 
@_date: 2013-01-04 07:08:35
I like coinbase a lot. Cheap, easy, and 87% of their holdings are stored offline so you don't have to worried about them getting hacked. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 07:53:04
I guess I was just confused on how generating an address offline would make it part of the public record. If it is never connected to the Internet, how can it be part of the block gain record? But you are saying that I can send coins to any made up address and it becomes part of the public record. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 11:35:57
Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-01-14 22:17:34
This is sarcasm right?
@_date: 2013-01-03 06:25:25
You would probably be better starting a private regulating force of some kind. Like the better business bureau for Bitcoins. Meeting the heads of these businesses and charging fees to the businesses for your verification. You know who they are, how they store coin and so on and people would feel safe doing business or investing with these companies.

@_date: 2013-01-02 06:36:08
This would be for the purpose of sending my coins to an offline wallet where I don't have to worry about them being hacked. 
@_date: 2013-01-15 10:00:06
Because you need money, electricity, and internet to buy, sell, and barter bitcoins. You could try to sell stuff for bitcoin, but there probably arent enough people. Until we can figure out a way to have secure "paper" receipts for bitcoins, they will not work in impoverished countries. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:04:19
Bitcoin shot up too quick. It is all the idea that  it will continue to rise that is driving demand and therefore price. There is no actual economy for it. People sell it for USD when it goes up. 
@_date: 2013-01-03 01:52:14

Just search the main forum.

I use coinbase because it's so easy. Takes a few days though. Also, it isn't anonymous, so could be bad for Silk Road.
