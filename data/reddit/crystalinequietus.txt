Long time lurker, first time poster. I've learned more about crypto in the last few months than I ever thought I would understand, but something is eluding me about Bcash.
As far as I understand, exchanges are driven by both buying and selling. When you sell, the order has to be matched to someone buying at the price you are selling for, else the the sale cannot go through. This is the very basis of "exchange" and the interplay is what drives a market.
What I don't understand though, is how a market can continue to function when one of these operations is disabled, but not the other. The current situation on coinbase is Bcash can be sold, but not purchased. If this is the case, who are the sell orders being fulfilled through? Who is actually buying what you have sold? Additionally, how can a market in which no one can buy show an increase, such as what coinbase shows on its chart?
Is this as sketchy as it appears to be, or am I failing to understand something simple?

Definitely the first time we've heard this.

Peaceful trucks? Just part of life.
Crypto? Too much.

If I understand capital gains taxes correctly, the tax owed is simply based on your profit from each trade, not how many trades are made.
If a bot is making hundreds of trades a day, they're not going to pay any more in taxes over all than someone making a single trade. Calculating the cost basis will be a pain in the ass, but if you're advanced enough to be using bot trading, you've likely already planned for that.
