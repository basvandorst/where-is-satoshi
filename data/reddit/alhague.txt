There are collective agreements (money per hour) but the problem is that this does not mean people are getting paid according to them because:
* their employer does not pay according to collective agreements 
* they are employed "temporary" (which does not necessarily mean for a short time) and earn much less than regular employees
* worst of all: they get a very badly paid contract for work labor, i.e. money is no longer paid per hour but for performing a certain amount of work.
I'm not saying that contracts for work labor are bad in general, it's just that they can be abused easily to undercut minimum wages.
This all has lead to a situation where quite an amount of people are so badly paid for a full-time or even over full-time job that they still need to request social benefits. Once they reach retirement age they will befully dependent on further social benefits because their retirement pay directly depends on their former wages...

overlays are nice (and the similarity is tempting) but I would never ever base a serious prediction on them.

Actiually what the article says is that they don't have to pay an *additional* tax for using bitcoin, just the normal taxes as if they were to sell their items in EUR.

previous IPOs on btct were like you put in your bet and you know how high it has to be at least (the announced IPO price), orders were served from highest to lowest.
LABCOIN was different, everone could put in bids at IPO price and a fixed amount of 7M shares is distributed at the IPO price to bidders according to the number of their bids compared to the number total bids. This was introduced because there was much higher demand than 7M and LABCOIN didn't want to earn more than what they expected to raise and announced in the IPO

Just thinking about how much of the pulled out money might be going into today's IPOs...

The issue is not about banks in general in Germany, it is about failing banks in Europe.
The EU finance ministers do not yet agree, though:

actually some say yes, free flowing (i.e. "tax-evading") cash shall  be eliminated. See bans on larger cash transactions in Italy, Spain or Mexico.
