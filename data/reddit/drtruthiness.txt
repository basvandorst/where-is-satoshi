I detect some bitter feelings about the meteoric rise of BitCoin holders' wealth.  Jaded feelings about wealth disparity brings out the absolute worst in people.  
The day I found out bitCoin broke 1k, I thought how awesome for people who hold them.  
Almost immediately there was talk about how all bitcoin holders would fail and lose it all.  
You kind of have to step back to truly take in how viciously some people have jumped in to ridicule people caught in this turn of events and are using it as a soapbox to advocate their vision of how everyone should behave.

Vorhees and bitcoin speculators harmed the value of my wages, investments, and retirement plans in no way whatsoever.  
I lost nothing through the actions they chose to take.  
I can't help but feel a little like many are all too happy to kick BitCoin users down a few notches.  The amount of anger some people have toward those who swapped some code over the Internet....it's fuckin weird man.  
The laughing I understand.  But the intensity of the shaming and hating and demand to regulate is eerie.  
That kind of anger I would expect from finding out your sandwich was laced with fucking yoga mat chemicals.  Not inconsequential magic Internet money.  
Edited:  fixed generalization "you" to "some people".

Unregulated bitCoin speculation didn't harm my wages, retirement, or currency value in any way.  
Regulated financial firms speculated with billions of dollars, took the profits, and forced losses onto everyone.  
Believe what you want about Vorhees.  His financial decisions neither demand your participation, nor claim entitlement to your contribution.

I don't see how much more clear this can be: 
-If you think BitCoin is risky, 
-if you think BitCoin is a Ponzi Scheme, 
-if you think BitCoin is a conspiracy, 
-if you think BitCoin is stupid, 
-if you think BitCoin holders are stupid, 
-if you think BitCoin is Tulip Mania pt. 2, 
-if you think BitCoin is for evil people, 
-if you think BitCoin is impossible long term, 
-if you think BitCoin can be stolen too easily, 
-if you think BitCoin is a cult, 
-if you think BitCoin is smoke and mirrors
Don't invest in it.  Not one cent, which you may never get back. 
Not one moment, which you will never get back.

The only difference between speculation in BitCoin and Speculation in our current financial system through the dollar is that **people who chose to speculate with BitCoin with their own money harmed others' financial wellbeing in no way whatsoever when it caused a bubble. Their risks and losses were theirs, and theirs alone.**
**When Wall Street speculated with the dollar, the bubble that burst fucked over everyone.**  This with an "accepted" currency, in a regulated environment, with not one fucking high level official going to jail for it.  
So when you feel like getting on a high horse and harping about regulation and how bad free markets are, remember and at least acknowledge that bitCoin users aren't lobbying regulators for billions in bailout money from **your taxes** for losing on their bets.

Not a lot of circle jerking going on in There is, however, lots of popcorn eating and a long line of people waiting for their turn to curb stomp and shit on people for holding bitcoin.  
There's also one or two manifestos on how Free Markets are super totally fail.  
No one asked.  But there they are
