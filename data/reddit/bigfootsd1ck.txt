This is where I keep mine.  I hear lots of people saying I shouldn't. I kept my coins on a bip38 (if I remember correctly) paper wallet for about a year, but I didn't like it.  I like using the coinbase app to check my balance and transfer money to the vault whenever I please.

Look, someone who is brainwashed by FAKE NEWS !!!
Speak for yourself!
I love the new roaring economy, tax breaks, vetting immigrants, lower unemployment, lower welfare claims, more jobs, less regulations, and I love that Trump calls out fake news! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:21:02
Since 91% of middle class income earners will see tax break, I find your statement unfair.  But yes Trump did give "the rich" a tax break by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  Shortly after the bill passed we did witness a the "trickle down" effect. At&amp;t announced $1,000 bonus to its 200,000 employees (many other examples). Also , Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bankcorp are boosting their minimum wage to $15 an hour.

I recently transferred multiple different coins off exchanges to my new ledger nano.  I chose segwit wallet for bitcoin, but went I sent a portion to bittrex, is still cost me $12 for the transaction.  Is this because bittrex was not using segwit?  Also what is the average transaction cost for segwit to segwit.

He is actually pretty decent to listen to when he is not in character.   But I have to say, when he is in character,  it's annoying as Fuck.  It's not funny at all and It distracts from the conversation and message.  But I guess I still like him....

AND if you use a credit card and pay your bill on time, you get CASH back...Bitcoin is awsome for buying things online that you dont want tied back to your bank account.  For many, this feature is worth the 15% premium you pay from coinbase or circle.  Im done waiting for bitcoin to hit the moon. It is what it is until more useful applications are created. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:13:20
I was just having fun because I sense irony in the fact that Atlanta sucks for bitcoin and Bitpay is headquartered here. Don't go getting all serious on me.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:54:29
Welp, dropping below 300 is not a good start.  Im really not feeling it this year as far as the price increasing. I plan to buy some bitcoin at bargin rates this year.  I do expect some ground breaking apps and a couple more large companies accepting Bitcoin in 2015.  I think we are years away from widespread acceptance. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:21:26
Also, circle allows you to use a Visa Debit Card for INSTANT bitcoin purchases.  With coinbase you must have a Visa Credit Card. Which i dont have so for me it was a game changer.  I no longer have to wait 5 days to use my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:46:54
Your right. Just used it for a $20 purchase.  My bank charged me $.58.  WTF. Is there any fee if I use a CC?
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:35:51
After waiting 5 weeks linking my bank account and debit card on circle I emailed them to see what was going on.  I received this same email.  It's been about 5 business days (no response ).  Maybe their team took a long ass holiday vacation....  I was hoping coinbase was going to have some competition.  Nope, circle sucks in comparison.

Morgan Rockwell of bitcoin kinetics is working on some really cool shit.  Seems like he is a little out their but I'm glad he is on team Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:01:48
I was unaware of that.  I just heard him talk about his hardware projects on the Bitcoin Talk Show yesterday.  Thought he might be one of those crazy weird brilliant types. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 18:03:02
I've used coinbase for the past 2 years with zero issues.  Last week I tried to buy coins 2 different days and it wouldn't let me buy over $100 (it made me reverify my mobile device each time...) In my settings, my daily purchase rate is much higher.  Doesn't make since. 
Also, just tried to login.  Couldn't get on. They appear to be having issues.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:43:38
I think your partially right.  Not enough people care/have a clue what it is.  Not yet anyway.  If a place were to begin accepting bitcoin in atlanta I doubt they would make more money.

He has a podcast, The david seaman hour. Also, does a newsletter.  He tends to talk about the same subjects over and over.  But he continues to deliver interesting conversations about cryptocurrency.

It's so weird that the last few times great news has come out about Bitcoin, the price blips up a bit, then takes a large downward slide.  Now that it's past the 300 mark, I got a feeling it's going to tank.  Which is good for allot of us who want to buy at a bargin.

I've used coinbase for 2 years.  Zero issues.  Until today! They asked me to verify my ID and I keep getting errors...I'm thinking about pulling my money out of their Vault since they continue to have issues.
