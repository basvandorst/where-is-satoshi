Sexual health is just more of a "thing" I guess. There are even companies that have medical sex workers that will go to patients who suffer from degenerative disease (cerebral pallsy, parkinson's, etc.) who are unable to self ejaculate now, so they have "nurses" who assist them. I think just in general attitudes are more open to this sort of thing and it's not really perceived as the men who do it are disgusting/vile/shunned.

This particular service caters to foreigners (nice all English website) which usually means inflated prices as you are paying for the convenience of knowing wtf you're getting. If you have a little bit of Japanese skill and can go to the services catered towards the locals, you can end up paying significantly less, 90 minutes will usually run you about ~20,000 JPY

Japanese law prevents the sale of sexual intercourse, so you can't have sex with most providers (though im sure it does happen). However, "intercourse" is defined as penis pentration in the vagina, so Japan skirts these laws by allowing the sale of blowjobs, handjobs, breast massage, sumata (which is rubbing your penis on the outside of their vagina), or even anal sex in some cases. All of that is perfectly legal and able to be advertised on websites as you see h ere.

Because I've booked them before. It's not really thought of in the same way as it is in the states here.

There are sexual service providers in Japan that accept cryptocurrency as payment.
NSFW obviously

Just how their cryptocurrency acceptance works and has today's schedule of "therapists" along with their "stats".
