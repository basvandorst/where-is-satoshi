This is the correct answer. I only bought 0.1BTC last week and already made $75 before it was in my wallet.

May as well be. It doesn't get to act like normal stocks on the stock market because it isn't one. Bitcoin doesn't follow trends, so if you want in, get in. You can look at it's behavior in the past and make a very rough guess at what's going to happen next, but it could act completely differently for seemingly no reason.

In the same boat. I'm glad I finally invested, even if it's not much.

I was implying a different form as going from fiat currency to cryptocurrency. There's nothing to "get". Bitcoin and groceries are completely different.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:14:51
I believe it

You're getting more defensive than you need to be. Bitcoin is a currency. Just because you bought some 6 years ago doesn't necessarily mean you know what you're talking about.

No it's not the same. You can't sell your groceries again in the future, and definitely not for more money.

Which is funny because ether has been painfully stagnat as of late
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:06:25
My thinking is that when you invest in Bitcoin (or similar), you still have the money, just in different form.

Not sure what you're trying to get at but okay

Crypto**currency**. It can be spent places. I'm doubtful a coffee shop would accept a load of bread as payment.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:15:22
I'd be impressed if you could find a buyer for those groceries. Groceries aren't a currency.

Where's it say anything about a laptop?

3400 now. I'm only hoping the trend continues.

Transfers onto a credit/debit card only take a few minutes in the US.

That's actually pretty accurate haha. gg

It does work that way, but you have to be lucky.

Remember when BTC was never going to go below 4000? I remember.
