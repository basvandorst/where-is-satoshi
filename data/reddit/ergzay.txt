Something I should note here. I've had a computer science security course where we were basically taught how do things like buffer overflows, SQL injections, cross site scripting (XSS), cross site request forgery (CSRF), etc. It was very eye opening.
One of the things my class mentioned is that coders often will send API keys unencrypted or store them unencrypted in memory. A lot of people when they build applications, notably in this case, phone wallets, don't secure the API keys used very well.  These can then be grabbed either by packet sniffing or a phone virus or something else along those lines (Android has lots of keyloggers/viruses on their store, Apple store most likely does as well, but much much harder to get them on there.)
The user in question most likely assumed it was the fault of Coinbase and never changed his API keys OR changed his API key and then started using the new API key in the same faulty way he was before thus getting it stolen again.
I expect Coinbase in the short term will probably add a clause to their registration contract that says, "We are not responsible for your bad security." or "We will not refund you if you are using a deprecated API key."
TL;DR API keys can be stolen. Don't use them in things that aren't secure.

No. Bull. He ate all the walls up by buying that amount, after that he literally leaves a vacuum behind him.

1Password is not vulnerable. 
It wouldn't make sense that is vulnerable. All encryption is done locally and only encrypted data is transferred. Even if you're man in the middle on the SSL connection it doesn't gain you anything. That's one of the primary reasons I use 1Password and even store my password archive on dropbox because even if someone has the archive it doesn't do them any good.

If you're only going by what the browser looks like then you're misleading yourself badly. You have no certainty at all about what code is in the browser besides what Google tells you. I understand that you don't want to go to the trouble of using Chromium, but you shouldn't try and hide things from yourself. Not tying to convince you to switch, but just pointing out that you're being inconsistent here.

I can specify number of overall characters, number of digits, number of symbols, and word-based passwords (with selectable delimiters). (Granted you could probably throw together a bash script to do this too pretty quickly.)


You mention a ton of applications for different things and that's one of the reason I like 1Password. It manages everything which greatly simplifies the mental load of everything. The one thing I wish it did which it does not do currently is support auto-fill into applications that don't use it's API. You have to resort to 1-click copy password button and then paste the password. BTW here's a list of apps that integrate into 1Password on iOS atleast: 


Good question. There's an explicit trust that is required from the browser extension into the 1Password application. If the application doesn't recognize the extension or the browser version then it rejects access. It is true that I am typing the password into the browser extension in that situation as opposed into the application.


Closed source, unfortunately! So yes there's a matter of trust there. I expect that erroneous network traffic generated from it would be quickly found by users however and I generally wait a while before updating to the most recent version to see if people report issues. They do support a bug bounty system though and they offer $25,000 to any exploits they receive that can figure out a way to expose cleartext.

AgileBits the creator is a commercial company so it's a for-pay product.


It's using AES-256 likely encrypted through open-source tools.
Here's their own thoughts on the matter with someone making exactly your concerns: 
I should note however that Google Chrome is also closed source as is their backend servers storing your passwords, though some of it is open source through Chromium.

That post is what prompted the blog post. You didn't read the forum topic before posting.
The poster even changed the forum topic of the post to "Cloudbleed: Cloudflare CDNs, does it impact 1Password? [no; see blog.agilebits.com]" but that's not reflected in the URL.
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:17:39
That really depends on how they implement it. 1Password has a seperate file structure that contains the passwords. This can be moved around like any file to anywhere and stored anywhere so you have full control over it. It can only be decrypted with your passphrase. The file is "1password.agilekeychain" which is a package (on OSX) and it also contains an html file that allows you to load passwords from it directly from any web browser if you bring the file archive around with you. Accessing it this way also works for OSes where they don't have standalone applications for it.


1Password supports things like:
* The most important feature, random password generation to generate maximal strength passwords of 50+ characters with random alpha-numeric-symbol passwords. These are basically unrememberable so it forces you to use the password manager to retrieve them, but you can paste them into most forms with a hotkey. It can also generate xkcd-style passwords (dictionary words separated by dashes). When it posts to web forms it avoids your copy-paste as well so your password never enters your OS's pastebin where it could possibly be snooped by malicious software on your system.
* Security Audit that will check your entire set of passwords for weak passwords that you may have created and forgot about. It also checks for repeated passwords across different logins. Or Old Passwords
* Can store: Credit Cards, Bank Accounts, Social Security Number, Software Licenses, Database passwords, Server passwords, Wireless network passwords, supports creating encrypted notes for storing arbitrary data (good place to store bitcoin wallet private keys, though I haven't used it for this yet) and it can autofill most of these datatypes through it's browser plugins so it doesn't force you to use Chrome if you prefer to use Firefox for example
* Supports password tagging so you can say tag all your company passwords with a tag so they're easy to separate from personal accounts.
* Can create multiple separate vaults that are separately encrypted if you want to divide say work passwords from personal passwords so you never have to type your personal password into a possibly key-logged system (if you're paranoid about your employer)
* It has API support so certain applications can access 1Password to fetch login information via a secure-vault like system


1Password works on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows. For whatever reason, they see no need to support Linux. There are various third-party crappy-apps on Linux that support decryption of the data however if you need to access it on Linux. It seamlessly syncs across everything else however. You can either use their dedicated servers to store it, or sync it yourself, or sync it via Dropbox (it also supports iCloud if you're pure-apple ecosystem). It supports hosting it's own WLAN server so that Android and iPhones can sync using it rather than some public server if you prefer to never sync anything to the web ever.


Is it actually encrypted locally? One of the reasons I like 1Password is that it's effectively guaranteed to be subpoena resistant so in the event that a government goes rogue its still protected. Additionally you have no control over Google updating Chrome. If they so wished they could push an update to Chrome that fed all the passwords of a selected user back to them without your knowledge. With 1Password I maintain control of the data and the software update mechanism.

Absurd. Gift the paper wallets with a connected blockchain.info account. Explain if they don't want them they can buy gift cards on gyft for anything they want. Explain past price and current price and leave decision up to them. Relatives I gave paper wallets to, after the above, liked the gift.
