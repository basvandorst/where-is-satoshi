Isn't global warming  a hoax perpetuated by China to slow down the growth of US? /s The fact that some rational folks here entertain the idea of Trump as president just baffles me.

Isn't that the main purpose of bitcoin? So every single person can be a bank?

That's a lot of food for one person!

tl;dr: Banks have been crooks for longer, therefore know how to get away with this stuff.

Just saw comparable products in Amazon. $17.99 for a bottle of 750 mL. They offer $31.85 for 1000 mL (2 bottles), that comes to $23.88 for the same amount, which is a ~$6 dollar difference. I'm not really calculating shipping (it's free in both cases for me). I wouldn't say grossly over priced but they could work on it, the other guys seem to have a much larger operation in place.

Thought recreational was legal in Colorado? But I mean, who doesn't wanna bounce around their ball-sack either way?

It makes me feel terrible that only now I came to know about the bitcoin bowl. Because of an idiot that doesn't even know what Bitcoin is -.-

Don't mine bitcoin.

AFAIK iCloud doesn't use a restful web API to take advantage of oauth, maybe your confusing it with something else?
That aside, there are a few known iCloud vulnerabilities just googling "iCloud vulnerabilities" yields a ton of articles with security researchers poking wholes at it.
iCloud is convenient therefore easy to exploit. Convenience in our field comes at very high prices.

Oh the irony.

Where can I buy this "bitcoin stock"?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:14:22


Why the fuck would anyone do that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:35:52
They don't sell "bitcoin stock" they sell CFDs.
Not to mention they're shady af:
