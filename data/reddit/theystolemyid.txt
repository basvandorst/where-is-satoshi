Well, his argument is a terrifying thought back in 2017. This year he seems to conveniently ignore so many positive development from government around the world especially in Asia.

Previously, Bank of Thailand(Thai version of The Fed) has banned all banks and financial institutions from dealing with crypto currency.
The new regulation reaffirmed the ban.
However, Banks and financial institutions can now set up subsidiaries and do the following;
    issue digital token
    provide digital token brokerage services
    engages in business involving digital assets
    invest in digital assets

Yep, much more progressive than we had expected.
Actually I just checked, the governor of the Bank of Thailand is pretty impressive. Completed bachelor degree at 18 and then got his PhD in Economics from Harvard at 24.

Actually, Thailand is now one of the most tolerance country. 6 Crypto fully legalizes(not perfect but a good start). Banks can now invest, become exchange, issue ICO through subsidiary. Exchanges are legalizes. SEC also allow issuance of ICO.

I think that even with top of the line miner with economies of scale and competent technical team, you would still making a loss at most part of the world without very cheap electricity. 
So with hobbyist tame down version of the miner you would be pretty much mining at a loss, that is let say your electricity cost $100 per month for the miner, bitcoin generated only $50 or something.

As a non native english speaker, can someone tell me what the refrigerator one suppose to mean? I knew all of them imply hodor but how specifically the refrigerator one would imply hodor?

I think that is just a parody. It would look bad on crypto if we share that thinking it is real.

After graduated from the US he started one of the first computer shop and then went on to created the first mobile phone operator and ultimately sold them for 2bn. In the mean times he was winning every single election for ten years before he was ousted and prosecuted by the military.
Today, he went on a podcast and talk about blockchain.
He cited case in Rwanda where blockchain is used to connect local supplier to retailer don’t know what he referred to.
He then explain about decentralization, how bitcoin could become internet of value and then encouraged that blockchain is something people should try to learn.

Hi, there has been so many report on bitcoin adoption over there. How true are these report? Is it still very niche like in other countries or you could actually say to may be 1-5% of your friend that you will pay them in bitcoin and they will be yes sure?
What about other coin, are there any other that people there actually interest in?

Only average person need crypto to keep their asset safe, actual corrupt people with power just use bank.

Interesting. For a longwhile I discounted Venezuela adoption since despite the news of parabolic growth when take clear look it's nothing much. For example, Subway accepting crypto is just one single store accepting and overall localbitcoin volume is a few hundred thousands USD. 
In the past few months things change, from a single branch now we have a couple of chains. Volume start to become meaningful. I live in a country with 60m population and I would say we have ok volume considering we are deep in the bear market but Venezuela(30m population) turn from having a fraction of our volume to now about 15x or about 30x per capita.

I agreed. I was thinking the same thing when he bought IBM though so I’m surprise to find out that he sold them all at a capital loss(got some dividend though).

Warren Buffett is pretty much biggest icon of trader, and he made a few negative comments on bitcoin through the years when bitcoin was in tripple digits.
His comment shaping a large numbers of discussion on Bitcoin. If you check the comment on Bitcoin you will see that people using his comment as an affimative that Bitcoin had to be a fraud.
When people are saying may be you shouldn’t put the weight of Buffett opinion on Tech the same as his other typically insightful trading opinion people who idolize him got very angry and it create a group think among stock trader that Bitcoin is inherently bad.
This is just to show why DYOR is important.

Does that mean the transaction cost for average user will going up? or the increase is simply from higher volume?

Do you think institutional investor coming into space is possible in the near future?
I have a couple of friends working as equity fund manager and if their opinion represent the industry then I don't think I could see funds in my country invest in crypto anytime soon perhaps 5-10 years in the earliest except for a few outliers. One of my college professor resigned from the country top fund and turn about 3m into 100m+ leveraging tech stocks the whole way up from 2008. He now has his own fund and one of my friend is working for him, his opinion on crypto is never ever touching them.
The regulatory environment is surprisingly welcoming though, early in the year central bank ban banks from dealing with exchange now they allow banks to invest in crypto(mostly blockchain companies but crypto is also allowed) if they do so through setting up new  separate subsidiaries. Recent fund managers training also include Crypto material of which my fund manager friend said WTF are they thinking.
I will have to say they are young by industry standard and grow up tinkering PC parts and following tech news religiously, their stock investment beat the market comfortably and they have understanding of crypto and some even have small investment in ETH they just see it absurdly risky for institutions. I hope it is difference in your circle?
