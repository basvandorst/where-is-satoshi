Well in the long run holding that position for a week or 3 might have given you slightly better margins. But if it crashes your in a good position to buy back in so I guess there's that. Plus your not a fool, nobody really knows where the fuck the price is gonna go.

Lol I'm currently "out".  I just don't think going balls deep and hoping shit will work out is a good strategy. Sure it could go to 33k 50k or 100 I'd be fucking glad if it did. But in between then are you mentally and emotionally prepared for the extreme volatility that Crypto is well known for??
Think about it. A lot of people had the same idea as you but just couldn't stand to watch their invest ment bleed. It's human nature, loss aversion. Your instincts will kick in trust me bro. Just hope you have strong hands my friend.

We are changing the world by owning bitcoin and alt coins. We are pioneers of  uncharted and treacherous lands. Visionaries who won’t take no for an answer.  
It starts with individuals like you and I, and as more people follow in our footsteps you’ll see that the world has indeed changed.

@_date: 2018-05-23 13:45:47
Wait till prices go back up, think about it just 2 or so weeks ago shit was pumping. I hear what your saying about school fees, but ask yourself do you have 2 weeks? If you do wait it out and sell at a more lucrative position, if not salvage what you can.  
Just remember you have to sell when the coin your holding is pumping, fuck fomo, if not you’ll find yourself in this predicament again.

That's why I think greeds the issue. You never lose when you sell. Shoulda woulda coulda doesn't come into play when your profilio is green. And let's not forget we hit 3k not too long ago, so there'll always will be an opportunity to buy back in ( most likely anyway)
 It's takes supreme patience, discipline and a birds eye view. I'm not advocating to sell every high, just that hodling isn't always the best option depending on the situation. However like you said crypto is an extremely irrational and volatile market and people should know what they're getting into for sure.

Most people's problem is that they hodl when they should be selling. They think every non sustainable surge is moon bound. When you think about it trading would be very simple if not for human emotions.

Sure that's certainly part of the problem, infact  Fomo and loss aversion are all due to emotional decisions. However the idea that one should hold forever is the reason many in the sub will never see significant gains. It's not too hard to tell when prices are unsustainable like 2 months prior. And sure if it goes to  a new ATH by years end you're good to go... But then you start thinking if I just continue to hold I can 5x this or 10x that. And eventually one ends up missing his prime opportunity to cash out and may even sell low. In essence most people hold out of greed and just ride the rollercoaster for the sake of riding.

Nothing wrong with that just be realistic, if it hits 3k dont expect to see gains for months.

@_date: 2019-06-22 14:46:46
Yeah, it's a little risky, but I find it complements my tendency to sell a little early. Hopefully we all get a little richer in this bull market. Happy gains.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:51:41
13k bro, at 9.9 it jumped to 11 then corrected back to 10.5 . The jump from 11.6 to now looks strikingly similar. So I'd sell around 13 and buy back in at 12-12.5

Correct me if I’m wrong but I feel like most people are mad at the coins or the market because they bought the hype. Back in November when crypto was booming everybody wanted a piece. But now we’re in the crash, which is bound to happen in any market, people are freaking out and crying Ponzi scheme.
They forgot the golden rule: Buy low and sell high.
I think this season is actually a blessing in disguise. It’s the  people who will take advantage of this crash that will get rich.

It's simple you want to secure as many profits as you can in this bull market. I'm not saying sell it all and wait for a dip, you can sell 25% each time it hits your designated level. And when the markets corrects, and it always does, you won't have to watch your profits drop. It's not sustainable to expect to get rich off one move or parabolic run, that's for the sheep and pigs and you know what happens to them.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:29:21
Funny thing is you'd actually aquire more bitcoins if you'd stop hodling all your life. It's not about ideals or the revolution, it's about making a buck. Not sure why you guys don't understand that.

That's what you all said at 20k. Remember there's ALWAYS a correction. Get off the elevator on the way up, that way when it goes back in you'll ,be in the  position. It's about gradually increasing your portfolio with every trade...riding up to the highest high is greedy and unrealistic.
