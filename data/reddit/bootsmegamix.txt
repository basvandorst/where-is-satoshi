Huge pain in the ass. Largely why I forgot about the 6 I had bought at around $2 each until seeing an article that they'd hit $500 each. Good old days.

The whole city of DC weeps for you. 
Doesn't change the fact that it's not smart to advise or condone others ducking taxes.

This advice could ruin someone's life.
Ignore the law at your own peril.
I hate taxes as much as the next guy but we shouldn't be condoning this.

Bitcoin Halvings perspective 
I beg to differ.

I bought ~6 in 2010 for $2.xx, and I cashed them out for around 800 each. I really needed it at the time to bankroll my new start, so I was very grateful that it was there when needed. But I have seen it's growth and potential over the last decade, and now that I finally have disposable income, I'm excited to be back in it.

The problem is these old farts need to be spoken to in simple terms that their slowly failing brains can understand.

Are you arguing against Bitcoin or Wall Street? I can't tell
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:41:56
This shit isn't worth your health. Don't put in anything you can't afford to lose. 
At the same time, if you have already bought, don't pull out like an idiot.

Hopefully not. Nothing good can come of it.

Go through a credit union, they don't care... mine doesn't at least. Bitcoin is a threat to big banks.

I bought $20 worth of BTC when they were about $3 each. I had forgotten about them until I read an article saying they were worth over $500. I waited until they were about $800 then sold.

Tell Mr. Pual he should put out a press release saying so

"The state representative behind the bill, Rickey Hardy, seems to think it's no big deal, admitting that this is purely to make life easier for law enforcement in response to criminals who steal stuff and then sell it off"
Really genius? Because someone who broke the law once by stealing isn't going to do it again by selling in cash? God people are so stupid.

Perhaps once there's a card system for brick and mortar businesses to accept BTC is when it'll really take off
