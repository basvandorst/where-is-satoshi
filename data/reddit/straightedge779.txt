Countries? Yes, it's all Wall Street's fault. Definitely not the fault of corrupt politicians and poor choices. 
And most of the libertarian / anarcho-capitalist types I know think the answer is less regulations. The mental gymnastics and amount of delusion at play for someone to actually believe that is off the charts. That's like solving a gang war by dropping the very best weapons (including biological) in the center of town. Or rehabilitating a child molester by giving him a job at an elementary school. It's detached from reality.

That'll never happen though. Bitmain and China won't remain a monopoly for much longer, several companies are already looking to make them irrelevant. They're the ones that are behind bch. China is where all the mining power is at the moment, and it's all consolidated &amp; centralized.
 Bitmain is the only ASIC chip producer, but that'll last a year at most. Once a few of these companies start releasing their superior rigs, Bitmain is in big trouble and so is bch by extension. Also, you'll notice the fees drop dramatically as well as all these mempool issues.

China put the same regulations and restrictions as their Fiat side has - can't send money out of the country without government approval, etc. 
People forget or simply don't know, China has incredibly strict fiscal controls on its citizens. They can't invest in foreign companies or send 7k to a relative overseas without government approval (which they almost never give). Cryptocurrencies allowed them to bypass those controls. Of course they're going to crack down. Charlie Lee should know this.

This was inevitable but more concerning is the fact that the IP theft/knock-off capital of the world hasn't had some other Chinese company rip off Bitmain and manufacture their own asic chips. It's been years and not a single Chinese company threw their hat into the ring for mining rigs? They literally rip anything and everything off, a factory across the street sees what the other factory is making and if it's even mildly profitable, they'll copy them. 
ASIC chips aren't cutting edge octa-core Intel chips. They're actually fairly mundane. You have other companies ripping off everything else, from mobile GPUs to tablet SOC processors. I find the lack of competition to be literally impossible. Which leads me to believe it's a government sponsored/forced monopoly. I think the government of China has a hand in this so they can control it. Just like they tried to do with rare earth mining a few years back. Even banned shipping rare earths to Japan for a bit. 
To me, that's extremely sinister. The PRC wanted to control mining. To what end, I don't know but once there's some real competition, I believe a lot of issues are going to mysteriously vanish.

The author is no economist, that's for sure... China was crazy about bitcoin because it has insanely strict fiscal controls on its citizens. It's that simple. You can't move $11k overseas for example, because the government doesn't allow it without approval. Moving your money out of China without them approving or even anonymously? That flies directly in the face of their entire strict fiscal policy.
Cryptocurrencies allowed chinese citizens to bypass those controls. *That's* why the PRC cracked downnon exchanges a few months back.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:00:09
Well of course they will. The PRC has among the strictest fiscal controls and regulations on its citizens. A regular, everyday Zhang can't move $6,000 USD out of the country without government approval (good luck with that) - cryptocurrencies allow them to do just that. And do so semi-anonymously. Cryptocurrencies, at their core, run contrary to Chinese ideology of total state control. Anyone who thought China is/was a friend to cryptocurrencies is either deluded or wholly ignorant of Chinese economic and domestic policy.

Correct. China cracked down on their exchanges a few months back precisely to make sure they're following Chinese law. And they have the strictest fiscal controls in the world for regular citizens (if you're a politician or rich chinese businessman, you're exempt usually, if you pay the right person off). I dare a regular Chinese citizen to try sending more than 10k USD worth of bitcoin out of the country. If you don't think China has ways if tracking it, you're deluded. I'm sure if you used some Chinese version of localbitcoin and bought it in person, using vpns to bypass the great firewall, you might be able to get away with it for a short while. But if you purchase it from an exchange, good luck.
This is what worries me with China: they **want** centralization so they can better control and monitor. Perhaps even manipulate. They are *not* friends to cryptocurrency. I feel bad for people who are getting into bed with China, or their shitcoin (NEO) or their exchange for foriegners (binance). They're going to get burned.

When economists talk about debt, they're really talking about spending. The debt is just a clever way to trick people into cutting spending, which allows for reduction in taxes. That's why you see the GOP and megarich bringing it up all the time. Debt is often a good thing at the national level.

You read nonsense. ASIC chips are not cutting edge or complex processors. They're simply *specialized*. That's it. They're made to perform a very specific task. Bitmain isn't freaking Intel, AMD or Nvidia. They don't have decades designing cutting edge processors. 
If any company at all decided to jump in the game, Bitmain would be hurting, badly. And several are already working on their own ASIC chips - there's a Japanese company coming out with 12nm with plans for 7nm. Bitmain is (allegedly) at 16nm. 
The opposite of what you say is true; Bitmain's days are limited. They've enjoyed profitability these past few years because they're a textbook monopoly. But that can't last forever, monopolies always are temporary in today's economic infrastructure.

Freezing or holding your money is initially done automatically by their software. They freeze it so it can be reviewed by a human. Telling them ahead of time won't really do anything because their software cannot be overridden easily, especially not by anyone working inside a bank. They have specialists working in their corporate offices who have that authority.
They can note your account which may help those people, but you're not going to get pre-approved. It just doesn't work that way. And most countries have laws regarding transfers of certain amounts of money. It may be a regulation in your country to hold the money while they make sure you're on the up and up. The bank has to cover their ass too; if they're found to be harboring illegal money, or facilitating criminal activity, they can be fined millions of dollars.

The problem lies in the fact that part of the reason for it's creation was to avoid that exact thing: regulations. Banks are literally mentioned in Bitcoin's white paper. Unfortunately, being unregulated also means Its the perfect currency for criminals.

This myth that bitcoin is a millennial thing is idiotic.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:29:36
FYI: millennials aren't the largest holders of BTC. The big whales own the majority are not millennials. I don't know why this sub is under the impression that bitcoin is a millennial thing. It was developed by an older cryptography nut who visited forums with other cryptography geezers like Hal Finney. Then saw use initially on the darknet by criminal organizations. Millennials are only just now jumping on. It's laughable how they feel entitled to the credit of BTC's popularity as if its "theirs" or they helped make it popular. Nope sorry. Millennials are turning out to be the least innovative and most uninspiring generation.

There are only a handful of fabrication plants - of course they're manufactured alongside other processors - Intel's cutting edge chips are made in the US at facilities with insane security. Not in Korea.

Reddit is now the 4th/5th largest website by traffic in the U.S (according to Alexa). Only Google, YouTube and Facebook are larger (Reddit keeps swapping places with Amazon from week to week). I don't think that's considered "sinking".

Satoshi never, **not once**, mentioned "government" in Bitcoin's white paper. And his posts on the forums were relatively a-political.

Concord was a good invention, rules and regulations made them impractical however. People didn't like hearing the Sonic booms every time one flew by. Rattling your whole house. This limited their flights to ocean travel (across Atlantic and Pacific).

The ban is only for regular citizens. They have strict financial controls on their citizens. Of course they would ban cryptocurrencies, cryptos allowed your average Zhang to ignore those regulations and do so relatively anonymously. 
And don't think for a second a majority of people will ignore the PRC's ban - if the government says it's banned because of terrorism, most citizens will truly believe it. They always believe the propaganda from the government - just look at what they say about today's Japan. Any other person would bust out laughing due to how ridiculous their claims are, but not Chinese citizens. Hell, they literally outright lie in their [history textbooks.]( Where as according to a recent Stanford University study, Japan's textbooks were [more accurate]( than even America's.

I'm intimately familiar with Japan's debt. It was a large part of my college thesis. And no offense mate, but you and the 2 other people who downvoted me have minimal economic knowledge. National debt isn't at all like personal debt so your "eye-popping numbers" mean literally nothing. That statement alone proves you are still conflating personal debt with national debt.
It would take me too long to school you in the basics so just check out a couple links here to start, then google:

[The Myth That Japan Is Broke: The World’s Largest “Debtor” Is Now the World’s Largest Creditor](

This is pure speculation, but I do think it points to him being Japanese in nationality. People in Japan are very a-political. Speaking about politics in public is almost seen as rude or vulgar. You come across as someone who cannot control yourself. Further reinforcing this are japanese boards like 2ch which is seen as a hangout of rejects and kids/teens (the only real big website in Japan which discusses politics). Lot of right-wing nationalists hang out there.

Only if you want to trade it for currency. You don't have to trade it for cash; you can trade it for any number if assets, stocks or even other cryptocurrencies. Or a combination. Then from there it becomes easier to get cash.

Reddit's age demographic skews 15-24. 90% of the users fall into that group according to Reddit's stats they released themselves.

I had an LTC transaction stuck for 3 months before finally support got to it. Due the increase in value over the time, I ended up a couple hundred dollars richer. Not a bad interest rate I suppose.

I share his perspective and don't support btrash at all. Who do you think has been fabricating mining chips all along? They're just doing what they've always done. This isn't new; the only new thing is the size of the chips are getting slightly smaller. That's not really relevant to us hodlers.
This post isn't just hyperbolic, it's idiotic.

Majority is young people? Haha. The big whales are **not** young people. Winklevoss twins? Born in 81. Satoshi? Almost certainly 40+ given the age of users on the cryptography forums he posted to while developing BTC. 
[See for yourself]( None of those people are young adults. Millennials even feel entitled to the credit of developing bitcoin when not only was the creator and older guy (and the second person to have bitcoin [was in his 50s]( but the people who hold the majority are not even millennials.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:42:12
Comment aside, he did hang out on a forum populated by older folks, old cryptography geezers like Hal Finney. Chances Satoshi was 40+ are really high.

Still trust them more than Binance. Though, that's not saying much. At least coinbase falls under consumer protection regulations - they can't just run away with your money. You have legal recourse if you run into issues. Binance, on the other hand moved operations to a place with *zero* oversight and with *zero* protections for consumers. They claim it's so no government can control or regulate them... What they don't mention is that it also means your fucked if they decide to screw you over. And when it comes to large amounts of money, your life savings, etc, I *want* those protections. You'd be a complete moron not too. A fool and his money and all that.

Banks don't give a shit about bitcoin. Anyone who believes otherwise is deluding themselves or doesn't understand how banks work. Banks view bitcoin as a highly speculative risky commodity. Not something that is going to disrupt their industry.

I admit, it got me. However, I knew something was off because Satoshi was extremely A-political in his forum posts. He didn't involve himself in that kind of thing (contrary to what this sub seems to think). So by supporting WikiLeaks, that would have been a revelation in of itself. 
Also, his very last post was a bit of a warning about WikiLeaks and bitcoin. He said that "we kicked the hornet's nest with the swarm heading towards us" and then we never heard from him.

That's if everyone makes a claim at the same time. Which would never happen. And if it did, the crisis which caused it in the first place is a larger concern. It would almost certainly make everything else moot.

In 2010, approximately 3100 people died from heroin OD (just heroin, the number excludes deaths where the person mixed heroin with other drugs) in the US. 
In 2016, over 21,000 people died from Fentanyl. [Source](
We don't even have an opiate epidemic, we have a Fentanyl epidemic. The number of opiate addicts didn't dramatically jump over the last 7 years, the number of deaths, however, has.

Inflation has never been a huge problem globally. Deflation, however, has been. And the effects are significantly worse taken to the extremes. 
With rare metals backing your currency, you could never be a major player on the global stage because you just handicapped yourself severely. You're unable to adjust to bubbles and recessions/depressions. Your economy weakens and can be easily manipulated by outside influences, and the list goes on. Fiat has shortcomings but it's the lesser of the evils by far. There's a reason why *the entire rest of the world* abandoned the gold standard and it wasn't because of the illuminati, Jews or reptilian people.

Coinbase isn't an American company. Regardless, binance isn't beholden to a government. That mwans they can do literally anything they want including steal your money and there isn't anything you can do about it. Sorry, I like consumer protection laws and being able to sue a company that wronged me.
