The future.

HODL is life.

You can cash out at anytime.
My suggestion would be to convert a little bit to fiat currency each year and hold the rest in crypto.

Sounds like they won't tax gains on it.

That's awesome! I couldn't get into coinbase.
This is the only time where I wish I kept more in an exchange. LOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:01
Yes. I was prepared to rebuy some dips and it's been down (maybe that's why BTC is dipping).

In a world where we cross 10k and 11k in 24 hours... yes. A guy I work with day trades securities and was bragging about how volatile something was. 
His volatility chart was cute by crypto-standards.

I'm looking for a number and I'm pulling out my initial investment at that number. Everything else will HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:54
You'll all kick yourself for not buying the dip.
It's already trending up again. I've watched it move +500 in 5 minutes.

You don't hook this up to a computer. These are ASIC miners. Plug into power and network. Then you'll connect to it once to set up your wallet address and mining pool and you're done.

Jesus, they're going to make shirts after you.

Set it and forget it.
You can mine any coin that uses the SHA256 algorithm. There's about 10 coins in total according to whattomine.com.

Expected a referral link to bitconnect.

MACD looks interesting right now. I think we'll see a surge back to mid 10's here pretty soon.
The best part is, people can say I told you it would crash.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:18:21
Correct. Last time I exchanged bitcoin to USD it took seconds.
Places like coinbase will exchange it into your local currency.

I operate out of an old server room (our whole infrastructure is hosted/cloud now). Fortunately power, heat, and noise are taken care of.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:25:15
This is only thing about the community that bugs me. I've been told to not get into bitcoin for years and I just stood on the sideline and watched it take off like a bottle rocket.
If you're in it for short term gains, NOW is a tough time.
If you're in it for the long term, start now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:27:13
I always sent people this one.
I'll give yours a watch though!

The normies are coming out of the woodwork asking me about BTC. I sent the Andreas video to my 64 year old CEO yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:13:18
My 8 year old knew about bitcoin from playing "Bitcoin Billionaire" on iOS. I looked at the game and laughed but the concept of mining with a computer were there along with a knowledge of digital currency as a replacement for money.

What's the recommended hardware wallet these days?
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:47:59
I've got nearly a a single BTC in coinbase. 
What's the best plan of action for me? Shove it somewhere that doesn't support the fork?
