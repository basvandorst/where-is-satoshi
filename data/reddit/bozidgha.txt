Yes. Just wait for the Bitcoin ETF this year. Watch this soar to $100k when bitcoin backed ETF comes out.

Bitcoins only been around for 10 years tho..
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:18:39
1) just a thought but With a finite number (21m minus those lost, as you mentioned) you can have an infinite amount of denominations (just take the number and divide by 2...forever...will NEVER hit zero). So you can give value to those low denominations , which would be caused by price of bitcoin going very high. 
2) you can always fork the currency, or gov can create different currencies for different utilities within society (gas coin, grocery coin, pharmacy coin) ...just a thought of a possibility

Coinbase is a great place to start - just has higher fees. Your next step, instead of learning about a new exchange, should be learning about the different types of wallets and how to get your coins off the exchange. They’re technically not “yours” until you do so
@_date: 2019-07-18 03:57:08
You can’t just sell with no buyer. The money comes from whoever wanted to buy. Then when price dips, u can’t buy without people trying to sell.  supply and demand determines the prices
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:08:34
U don’t control private keys. It’s easy to use if you’re looking to trade. Not to own
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:15:57
Coinbase? Has a long wait time. And yes. Whenever starting in something new go slowly and read info about it. Don’t just jump in

Ur silly
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:21:12
If ur original goal was to make a quick trade for a profit, then sell now because you accomplished that. If you got involved with bitcoin because of what you believe it stands for, then hodl. If you got involved because others were talking about it, read more and educate yourself. My suggestions for you, even though you should do the last one regardless. :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:11:57
I agree. Bitcoin is extreme volatile. That’s the type of vehicle traders love because they make most money that way. These are not “investors” or believers or bitcoin. These are traders drooling at the chance for an extreme volatile instrument. Bitcoin is that for them. Get ready for a roller coaster of a ride!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:54:08
Yes it does take this long. Normally delivers your coins in a week
Edit: the delivery takes a week normally, the “pending” should be quicker

@_date: 2017-12-03 06:54:04
Bitcoin is not associated with any other asset class. That is one of the appeals of it. Even though right now it is volatile, it will reduce portfolio volatility because it doesn’t move with stocks, bonds, gold, etc. it’s its own class

It’s the same mania that led the dot com boom, the housing market boom, etc. big money does not want to miss out and will create a bubble to the likes we cannot imagine. It will be ignited next year. The “use” of it won’t matter. They just don’t want to not have their money involved. I agree with what ur saying, but what im saying is it doesn’t matter because Wall Street/funds are just going to pour money in to not miss out. Whole crypt market is what, $550B approx? That’s peanuts to big $. Watch it grow 10 times min. It won’t be rational at all, but it will happen

Oh I never said bitcoin will never fall. I need it to fall, to have a healthier move upward. It went too high too quickly. I’m happy for the correction. Although u are correct about me hodling. I think it will teach govs a lesson too. I mean, u heard about them thinking about the “fed coin”. They know their fiat printing days are numbered. But the “fed coin” won’t happen for a few years. Bitcoin on the other hand, will be here. It will be seen as somewhere in the middle of a currency and a type of gold. Ur right. Fees are high, transaction speeds slow. Will they fix it? Who knows. I do know that when new money enters the space, like us, they will go straight to bitcoin, and then trickle down to alts. Futures, etfs coming (and etfs backed by bitcoin coin, not futures) , Goldman Sachs in June...this party is just getting started. Can we make a bet? We will see bitcoin at $60k sometime by end of 2018?  0.001 btc bet? I think ur correct in a lot of what you say, but that vision of yours won’t be here til 2020 earliest. People are greedy and they are now entering this space. 2017 will look tiny compared to 2018
Edit: we may have to bet a different coin cuz fees may be too high....lol

The wave of new money entering the market is going to be insane. Ur hopes of being wrong will be confirmed. This will definitely hit $40k minimum next year with alts (the major ones that serve a purpose) rising to. The crypto mania is literally just about to get started. Sell some to keep urself sane if u need to, but hodl a little to indulge on what’s about to come

Sound like a good bug, although I do not disagree. There is, however, soooo much more to bitcoin than beating inflation and maintaining purchasing power (a few being creating trust, purely peer 2 peer, cryptographic security) which will truly excel growth in all industries.

Trying to use conventional financial regulatory systems on bitcoin won’t work. That’s their problem. They will try to put old regulations on a disruptive tech that they don’t understand. 
There is no problem. Only for centralized institutions who do not embrace this new tech or try to limit its potential, which no one fully understands yet

I think it’s that he went into a  bitcoin store (store?) and bought some btc. But these weren’t any normal coins, these were magic bitcoins.

Use it to understand where the market lies. It’s in its infancy. Eventually these guys will be asking you, “so how much did you make?” Because that’s all they understand. They can’t understand the tech and feel safer among the sheep. I’d be using their negative comments as knowledge that this is still a buyers market. Once they ask you how to get some, maybe start selling

No the government does not create solutions. They take good ideas and infect them. Milk them dry, put $ in own pockets. I would say this was created by someone looking for a solution.

Douchebag isn’t an insult, I think u have cleanliness ;). I’m suggesting that if you have a crypto paraphernalia store, your purpose is to promote crypto, you are proud of not accepting fiat, etc...ur intentions are simple. To promote the revolutionary change into crypto. I would think it be best to have items priced in crypto: To support that change in mentality. You can have a calculator (so people like, ehem, you , don’t have to do math....). You can have links to introductory videos where they can learn more. You can take real pride in educating the newcomers and offering awesome gear in the process. And btw, no hard feelings ;)

1) I have multiple wallets
2) I get too scared that i'll mess up
but yes. If you can do that then you create a safe that no one can "crack". The mental safe.

You’re worried about energy consumption!?!? Manbearpig is a much larger concern and unfortunately not addressed enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:38:44
That is one of the reasons why I believe it will be higher. It IS still hardly used. Word is spreading quickly (you tell someone, they start investing, they spread word) and countries are adopting it as a viable means of payment (ie. japan) and other citizens are in countries that are suffering such inflation (ie. venezuela) that they are turning to bitcoin. There are so many reasons to own it and it is literally just gaining traction in 2017. I would still say at least 95% of people haven't heard of it. Imagine what will happen when Wall Street allows ETFs, futures trading, hedge funds to directly invest (Although some have started, but not the "big boys" yet). There are so many ways to increase the already-exploding demand. Limited supply. This is just starting...
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:41:40
I see your point. It is like gold (me, for example) in the way that people are not "spending" it. But it's new. Many see it as an investment. There is no real need to use as currency just yet. But once more people start hopping on the train, once the global population of owners increases, then..why not pay with it? if everyone accepts it, we'll use it. Plus, countries are devaluing their currencies nonstop. I used this example already but Venezuela is the perfect example
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:53:52
Exactly. We must be comfortable with owning it first, then we are too excited to "use" because the price of it keeps going up! So why would i use bitcoin for a sandwich when I can use cash? Cash's value is decreasing while Bitcoin's is increasing. But some people don't have the cash option (because their currency is worthless), and they are using bitcoin.. Small stepping stones  
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:16:17
A bubble is when investors/traders drive the price of something (stocks...or bitcoin...) above its value. So the question is, what is the true value of bitcoin? I believe it to be much higher. We have just seen the very tip of the iceberg. Get ready for the surge in demand that will push BTC to $10K by end of this year.
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:15:14

It’s not just third world nations being manipulated....USA has pumped trillions of dollars in our MS decreasing the value of each dollar each day. We have increased our debt more in the last decade, than all previous years combined.

Correct. Invest in experiences, not items

So you should be upset at your timing of entry that probably didn’t have any research done. You probably heard stories and the media and jumped in during the hype. Thing is, you were up, but decided to not sell. Be upset at your own behavior, not bitcoin.

True, but I bought a gold etf before buying actual gold. I guarantee the same will hold true for many people and bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:58:48
Yes it will. It will make “getting exposure to bitcoin” as simple as a click of a button. Just like buying stocks. Crypto is hard for noobs to enter. Private keys, public keys, wallet, ...it’s too much to learn for &gt;85% if population to learn and practice effectively/safely. ETF will open the doors for these people. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:05:05
You won’t have too many opportunities like this. You will look back at this moment and curse yourself for not investing more now when you know in ur gut it’s the right thing to do. Don’t let ur fear take over....

I agree with the 2nd part but believe they want this out there and available to the masses ASAP. USA can’t afford to fall behind other countries (already behind Japan, S Korea, maybe China) in getting regulated products out there. Too much potential $$ at stake

I agree. And I agree with waterfall effect. Every new person entering space will buy what? Bitcoin. The go to. Then yes, It will trickle down to alts. It’s how I stared and how I’m assuming a lot of us started too

Assuming a linear relationship is incorrect. Doesn’t account for more crypto users coming on board. You should create an exponential equation , but that would be more difficult to apply a value to population growth, or in this case, demand growth

Volatility in a bull market is our friend. The dips should be treated more as buying opportunities. Not giving u financial advice, just a perspective.
