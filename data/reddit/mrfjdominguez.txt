I'm sorry about your experience, I use Moolah as a POS in my business and Prelude to sell, transfer, buy. I've had issues before but they have always been super helpful. I recommend Moolah to all small business that want to start accepting Bitcoin and Dogecoin. They are good people and will make it right.

And if you want to buy comic books with Bitcoin, Meltdown Comics on Sunset Bl in Los Angeles takes BTC and Doge

The only bummer about this hotel is their pool. other than that, Love this joint!

Why would you not say what location? We that have Bitcoin would support anywhere that accepts it. I do whenever I get a chance. I spend Bitcoin cause I accept Bitcoin. Shameless plug: Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles, Calif. We accept BTC and DOGE

Kinda lame cause you could be making this up?

Joey, it's not negative at all and should be a concerned. But I've been in talks with Gogocoin for a while now, they've partnered with Blockchain to create wallets for each of the cards, get a card, get a digital wallet. Cards will only be loaded at time of purchase for the amount paid.
1. Buy Bitcoin Gift Card
Buy $25-$500 gift cards.
2. Redeem for Bitcoins
Booty -&gt; *Redeem the dollar value to bitcoins. GogoCoin charges a 7% above spot rate fee at this time.
I feel very confident working with them. 
But I do want everyone that ever thinks about buying BTC Gift Cards, to always double, triple check who you're buying it from.

then what's the point of holding it. I gots, I want to spend. I'm also a business that accepts both Dogecoin and Bitcoin, I would love to see people eager to spend. I do whenever I get a chance. I love Vegas, the D hotel and others accept Bitcoin, FYI
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:27:26
I use Moolah.io but i accept Dogecoin as well. May jump onto GoCoin, in talks at the moment. 
Check them out tho. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:07:26
Got those already, thanks! just looking for some that aren't there and new peeps that need to help us move this currency around. If we don't spend it won't go anywhere. looking for brick and mortars, mom and pops. 
Thanks all!

No problems from Bitpay from my end I just needed on processor for Doge and BTC. Moolah was my answer. But square is the devil. Its easy and convenient but the charges are murder. I prefer the -1% processing of crypto.  Over the almost 2.5% to process a transaction. Not hating I'm a mom and pop shop, looking to trim fat wherever possible and credit cards fees are fatty
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:50:26
just mind your own biz, thanks. you must be bored
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:52:26
Should if guessed by your name you got nothing better to do
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:23:56
Well I use Moolah.io and they've been nothing more than helpful. I run their POS at my business and works flawlessly, contact their customer support and they respond. I've Transfer Doge and BTC from sale transactions to my wallets and no problem. Don't know what you're getting at. They are a good company and don't need to be tainted with a witch hunt. They are helping small businesses like mine achieve sale processing of the future. I'm from Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles California. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:14:05
Yes. But how about Google?
@_date: 2014-06-16 02:14:09
For a PR person like yourself  this is no PR. Maybe the business you're referring to could of gained new customers
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:39:34
What do you mean by circled? been seeing that word floating around alot lately. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:24:51
I have a business that accepts both BITCOIN an DOGECOIN. I'm currently using moolah.io to process both but if you wanna cash out either all or a fraction of your Bitcoins then use Bitpay. Super easy. If you get lost feel free to contact me. My business is Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles.

Thanks buddy

I run Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles first to take Bitcoin and Dogecoin. I vacation in Vegas a lot and choose to stay at the D Hotel solely cause I can use Bitcoin there. Marketer far from it. I am spending the fruits of my labor tho.
