Down or slightly up. You are taking money out of bitcoin to create the new coin. Ppl think it's free money which is funny. Ppl investing last few weeks in bitcoin will probably lose on both ends. But then again, lots of money is sitting there waiting. So who knows how much money gets poured into it all. I say the last 2 months of money lost in Total market cap, multiply that by 2 and that will be coming back in next 6 weeks.
