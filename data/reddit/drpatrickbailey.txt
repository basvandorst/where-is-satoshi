Hello All.
First of all, I am Dr. Patrick Bailey as seen in this video. I made the PPT slides and I paid for the video. I did not name that title on YouTube. That was done by someone else named Zortan who was the first to steal this video on YouTube and use it for his own OneCoin marketing in Serbia. There is also a guy in England using this video for his own use.
Second of all, Jbeau3000 below is a profound liar and evidently does not care about the Truth. He seems more interested in promoting Bitcoin against all odds, than using the internet to find out some Truthful Information. Good ahead: Look Around! Try the Institute for New Energy as a start...
Third, I will not being paying any attention to people with big egos that want to promote their own views without researching the facts. What I did as a Captain in the USAF is my concern, and not yours - you can't find out anyway, as it is not public.
Forth - I do hope Bitcoin continues strong, as it will pave the way for OneCoin, just like Apple replaced Commodore, and Facebook replaced MySpace. BitCoin has HUGE losses in which the buyers have to absorb (like 20% stealing). BitCoin is owned primarily by banks, and that is why it is so supported in the West. OneCoin is owned by the members (&gt; 2.5 million now), and the highest member can sell or transfer only a maximum of FORTY (40) coins per day. Try to crash the OneCoin market with that. They are in it for the LONG TERM. And -
Fifth: Yes, OneCoin may not be a cryptocurrency in 3 years from now. I don't know. If not, a better one will arrive. I do know that some people are making 35,000 Euros per week because they got into OneCoin early on. I also now a guy in the USA who has made $1M in 6 months. I do hope the OneCoin itself is successful, as it is needed in the unbanked countries of the world. However, slander and lies will not change the Truth about what is happening. 
Instead of promoting BitCoin, perhaps you should rather be interested in: the War and Emergency Powers Act which allows the US Government to have classified departments and classified Executive Orders; why the USA Corproration went Bankrupt in 1933; why your name is all capital letters on your driver's license and all of your bank statements; and why you don't care about what really happened 9-11 - all of which will soon change your lives. (Search for the 45 min video using "9-11 solved".)
I urge you to get real and see what is really happening around you - rather than to type false information on your keyboard for ego gain.
In conclusion: 
Have a Nice Life.
