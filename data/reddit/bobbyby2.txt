some additional points:
often in the case of a recession demand breaks away leading to the increase of the value of money because price of a product is adjusted down according to demand. predictors of such a recession is indebtedness of marked participants and their ability to stay afloat (able to pay the interest). usually it is the private sector. direct or indirect government spending then is like money printing to prop up demand.
hyperinflation can only happen if supply breaks away big time. like in zimbabwe when agri output fell drastically after the takeover of the white farms and the government did not adjust their money output accordingly. or if an economy is switching to a war economy and does not impose price controls (one example: since governments can print money anyways war bonds are not there to lend the government money but rather to reduce private demand). either way it is too much money in circulation for the economy to supply goods and services for. during a recovery of the economy there would/could be just normal inflation. 
the ways to reduce the money supply: taxes, stop/reduce direct/indirect government spending or the new invention of negative interest rates. these negative interest rates only work if inflation is higher than the interest rate and not enough good investment opportunities in the economy.

in a real crisis they would go into physical gold and out of bitcoin and gold certificates. government could just make bitcoin illegal.

in that event government could just make bitcoins illegal. much harder to enforce for having/trading gold than bitcoins.
