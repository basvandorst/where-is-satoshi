"While we applaud the NYDFS for being forward thinking on virtual currencies, we feel the proposed BitLicense falls short of its stated goal of balancing customer protection and rooting out illegal activity while encouraging innovation."
How is the NYDFS being forward thinking? I read the proposal and I would argue it is very backward thinking.

It seems like everyone commenting on the proposal can easily see how it is onerous and will stifle innovation. If you watch the hearings they had with the Winkelvoss twins, et al., and then you read the proposal they don't align at all. It's like the hearing never occurred. They didn't take the advice of those in the hearing. That would have been forward thinking. Instead they proposed this regulation that is so burdensome and harmful that companies and bitcoin experts from around the world are calling it out. If this is their attempt at forward thinking god help us.

It's funny that you should mention linux though because I was thinking about making a comparison between linux and bitcoin the other day. Basically I was wondering if it would be a good thing if bitcoin turned out to be like linux in the future.  Meaning, linux is a very good OS(fewer bugs, open source, constantly improving) that for whatever reason is only used by a small fraction of people on their personal computers when you compare it to "established" OS's like Windows or iOS.(although the analogy is weird because of the prevalence of linux as the default OS for servers) So as a payment processing system bitcoin may always be around as this technology that is better than the "established" system(banks, paypal, credit cards) but for whatever reason doesn't get a huge market share. 
tl;dr. kind of off the wall analogy between bitcoin and linux that has nothing to do with this thread.

Hi Plumerian,
I am also fairly new to programming. I recently completed the codeacademy Python coarse. I've made a python program that scrapes the Internet for lawyers' email addresses(long story). But otherwise haven't had any good ideas for how to use Python. 
Right now I have an idea for a JavaScript program involving Bitcoin. Maybe we can collaborate/learn JavaScript together while working on this pet project that I plan to release open source. I think it's going to be basic enough for n00bs yet pretty cool and might give us street cred with the Bitcoin cool kids. 
Anyway PM me if your interested.

Ya I was very excited when I heard he would be a guest speaker. Especially considering how small my class is (50-60). 
He was given 1BTC on a physical coin after he gave a speech somewhere. He said BTC was worth $98 when he got it and he threw it in his sock drawer(full of foreign currencies) and then happened to see the price had risen to $800 so he asked some friends if they wanted to buy it and he ended up selling it for a gift card for amazon. So he said he had about $700 still to use on amazon. But he likes the idea of bitcoin.

You can't buy all the bitcoin. As you buy them the price goes up and up. Just like you can't buy all the real estate in the US or buy all the gold. In order to buy you have to have a seller. I won't sell mine for anywhere near what the market price is for them right now and if someone were buying up all the bitcoin the price would be rising at a very fast rate and I would become less and less likely to sell mine. 
But hypothetically if someone bought all the bitcoin it doesn't erase from our minds the knowledge of this new technology that allows for super cheap transfers, blockchain technology. That's the real threat. That's the bell that can't be unrung.

I live in Austin. I go to the weekly bitcoin meetups we have here. I felt like I had my finger on the bitcoin "pulse" in Austin... Then this week's SXSW tech week started and I was shocked by how many people are accepting bitcoin. A shocking number of food trucks (a signature part of Austin's food culture) are accepting bitcoin. As I walked around in the crowds I overheard many people talking about bitcoin just randomly. I convinced a bunch of Yahoo employees to buy bitcoins at the Handlebar (where the first US bitcoin ATM is located). 
This reminds me of the early days of Twitter, which also really took off in Austin at ACL.

I bought my first BTC when I was deployed to Iraq in 2011. I was chatting online with a friend back in the states who was a regular on the silk road and he was telling me about how this new currency was the shit. I bought $550 worth from him. Then I sold 1BTC for $900 in like 2013. And then I set up automatic buying every week on Coinbase after the big crash from $1100. So BTC has been good to me. I got extremely lucky with timing.

Bush didn't lead the counter insurgency tactics. Presidents don't get into the ground level tactics of war. Those were done by the commanders on the ground. We had a tremendous COIN effort but it didn't matter because the insurgents were determined and had guns. That's all it takes. We tapped their phones. We actually tracked them by triangulating their cell phone calls too. We had informants within their organizations. We planted fake ammunition and mortars around the cities so when they tried to use it it would explode on them. We had virtually non-stop drone over-watch. We had artillery and "armored personnel vehicles with fully automatic turrets and 6 Marines in body armor." We had basically endless resources at our disposal. We had an extremely high numerical advantage. We had jet fighters. We had tanks. We had attack helicopters. The insurgency was actually very small in numbers. It did not enjoy popular support. Many Iraqi civilians hated the insurgents and would inform us of their plans. The insurgents didn't have a lot going for them except they had AK-47s and determination. 


This isn't really true. The reason we lost is we fought with our hands tied behind our backs. I'm not advocating that we don't fight this way but I'm just pointing it out. If there were no Geneva Convention, no rules of war, no escalation of force rules the insurgency would have been destroyed in a matter of days. Like say we are driving through an Iraqi town and someone takes some pop shots at our vehicles. We could kill everyone within a 5 mile radius guaranteeing that the shooter was killed and acting as a deterrent to others, but we don't because that would be politically/morally unacceptable. We have B-52 bombers. We could have just carpet bombed entire cities and killed everyone. We did not try to "kill our way to victory".  The insurgents have no such rules. They don't wear uniforms. They don't care about civilian casualties, in fact they often targeted civilians. They use chemical/biological weapons if they can get their hands on them. I have personally been hit by a road side chlorine bomb. I've seen them blow up city buses full of civilians. I've seen them tie civilians to chairs and then, using a handheld electric drill, drill into the knee caps and then give the video to the victims' families. So it was one side obeying Geneva Conventions and one side doing whatever they wanted to win.
My only question is why anyone in the US would choose to not own an AR-15. They're pretty inexpensive. Easy to learn how to use properly. Fun as hell to shoot. They are great for hunting. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:16:23
They would worry about civilian casualties whether the govt is fighting Iraqi or American insurgents. Politically you can't just massacre everyone. The capability is there but the political will isn't. Even people opposed to an insurgency and on the side of the government would be horrified if we carpet bombed some Iraqi or American city. Not to mention foreign govts. We had control over the Iraqi communications too. You don't think we monitored their cell phone networks? I've been on missions where we tracked people by their cell phones and they knew we were tracking them by their cell phone and they flushed it down the toilet. That happened. That wasn't enough to defeat dudes with rifles. The insurgency continued. All they need are rifles and they can fight on forever. Similar to what we saw in Vietnam and what we are seeing in Afghanistan. We would often arrest insurgents in Iraq with zip lock bags full of SIM cards. They would use new SIM cards for every call. 
ISIS came later. The invasion was in 2003. I don't think ISIS really became a thing in Iraq until like 2011. Maybe they did some minor things before that but it wasn't until we left that they became a force to be reckoned with. The country was relatively quite and being rebuilt for a few years but stupid decisions were made. Like disbanding the entire Iraqi military and banning anyone who was in the Bathe party from holding government positions (everyone who knew how to operate in a government capacity was in the Bathe party because that was the only party). Almost all the military aged men in the country were overnight unemployed. Iraq had like a million man army at the time. It was one of the largest armies in the world at the time. Also people who used to have power (Sunnis) were now losing power and they started the insurgency. It just grew from there. Al Qaeda was non-existent in Iraq before we came. They saw the opportunity once the insurgency was built to move in. A lot of them came from Syria. Then they were mostly in the Sunni areas because AQ is a Sunni thing. Just like ISIS is Sunni. Al Qaeda basically morphed into ISIS. Most of Iraq is Shiite. If you talk to a Shiite they are as befuddled by suicide bombing as any American which some people find surprising. Suicide bombing/ISIS/Al Qaeda are all Sunni phenomenons.  So Shiites are opposed to Al Qaeda and actively seek out and kill them. Al Qaeda blew up a bunch of the Shiite mosques. Al Qaeda would blow up people walking in Shiite pilgrimages to Najaf and Karbala. A lot of sectarian violence ensued. Saddam was a Sunni. So in pre-invasion Iraq Sunnis were the ones who got to go to universities. Sunnis became the generals. Sunnis were the ones controlling everything. But Sunnis were a minority. They opposed democracy because that meant allowing the majority Shiites to vote. When we had to work with the Iraqis you usually wanted to work with Sunnis because they were more educated (relatively) and usually better organized. Iraq never fully stabilized while we were there. Corruption was obviously rampant. Corruption wasn't even hidden. People would appoint all their family members to government positions and it was almost expected. When we pulled out of Iraq the insurgency was basically waiting for us to leave. They easily captured a bunch of equipment we sold/gave to the Iraqi army. I bet Iraqi army commanders just sold it to ISIS when they got the chance. ISIS basically conquered the entire Sunni majority areas of Iraq because they had the support of the people in those areas. They were getting close to Baghdad itself. They morphed from insurgency to regular militia with tanks and other vehicles. Captured Mosul. I'm sure we saved them from being conquered by ISIS with covert units, air strikes, and access to our intelligence gathering capabilities.
I'm going off on a tangent but the real take away is dudes with rifles have defeated the US Military in the past and are currently doing the same in Afghanistan in real time that you can watch. This isn't something that we can argue. It's literally happening right now and has happened in the past. Imagine how much harder an American insurgency would be! Americans are highly educated, wealthy, have access to tons of resources, oh and most importantly tons of AR-15s (the most popular rifle in America). It's a beautiful thing because it keeps tyranny at bay despite constant efforts to grow government and take away people's rights.

I'm aware of the atrocities committed by our forces. The difference is we punish people who break the rules of war. The insurgents condone it. I don't really know what you mean by "blinded by war". I'm opposed to the wars. They weren't justified. I was basically too young and naive to realize that I wasn't doing what I swore to do. Plus I needed the money to pay for my education. I'm just pointing out that you can defeat the US military with rifles.
