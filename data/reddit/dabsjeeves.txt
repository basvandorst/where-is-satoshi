Coinbase is having trouble verifying my bank account, I've tried multiple times. Do you know what could be wrong?
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:57:06
The bank account is a few months old, just moved halfway across the country. No direct deposit or automatic bill pay yet, does it look for those?
Last night I got an email from them saying the deposits had been made, after I had already gotten the email saying they couldn't locate my account. No deposits had been made and I emailed them back to try and sort it out.
Thanks for the help though.

I've sent my account and routing number to coinbase twice, and both times got an email saying they couldn't find it. It's chase bank, if that helps.

Why are gox btc worth less than normal?
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:02:04
Yeah sorry, my bitcoinity somehow switched itself to goxcoins and I'm not super in the loop, just keep an eye on the price.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:10:05
So why can they even have a separate price for their btc? Why aren't they just shut down yet? They've fucked up too much and that's hardly an exchange if you can't withdrawal.

No need to be such a douche. Yes maybe it was obvious to you and me, but some people haven't been using computers their whole life.

You'd really think so, but if I've learned anything, it's that there are some people in this world who are absolute morons.
I know at least a few people who are familiar with bitcoin but would not be able to tell the difference if that URL was the one in their address bar. 
But then you also have to be dumb enough to fall for one of those stupid facebook ads.

Yeah really coming across as an asshole.
