You're being pedantic. If you like I can make the point that a 2016 and 2015 bill are both worth $100.
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:35:52
If I give you a bill made in 1980 or a bill made in 2016, do you really care which one I give you? The bank will treat them both as being worth $100.

Because the full implementation of Lightning depends on Segwit existing.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:29:44
Here is the link for those 99% I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:01:51
The answer is yes and no. 
Yes, a limited version of Lightning is possible without segwit, but channels would have to be time limited.
No, it is not possible to have the "full" version of lightning, as we can have today with Segwit.

A checksum on the address determines if it is a valid bitcoin address. 


[The 5 BTC have already been sent to the address.](
What I am saying is that the address is valid and likely generated by blockchain.info or by coinbase. A QR code bug couldn't mangle an address and still have the address be a valid bitcoin address.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:35:37
Maybe you are thinking of blockchain.info's coinjoin app, which no longer exists?
Coinjoin is only vulnerable if not implemented correctly.

You lose an opportunity to make money.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:14:10
It would be an invalid address.
The chance of still having a valid address after randomly changing 1 character of an already valid address is about 1 in 4 billion.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:46:12
There was no guarantee that bitcoin would get segwit. In fact until 2 months ago some devs seemed resigned to it never coming to bitcoin and accepting this.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:05:20
Lightning can add not only 100x or more capacity increase, but also instant no confirmation required irreversible payments.
BCH adds 8x capacity increase with their block increase so far, but also adds 8x on chain resource requirement. What happens when capacity needs to be 100x or 1000x greater than it is today?
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:55:06
Now I'm impressed.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:17:44
There is a good chance that you still have access to these funds. The odds of a valid address being generated out of an erroneous input is tiny (1 in billions).
I suggest you restore your wallet from seed phrase on your laptop on the blockchain.info website and see if the new wallet scans and detects your 5 BTC.
Also, generate new addresses in your blockchain.info wallet and see if the address 16H5t2a9vgTS2vRgu3nvmRneQymwV6XjFq is generated for you.

Until recently we didn't even know if bitcoin would get segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:25:28
The decimal system is grouped into 1000s. 
Grouping bitcoins into denominations of multiples of 1000 each is not arbitrary in that sense.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:59:28
Without segwit lightning is limited in what it can do, regardless of implementation time.
Lightning is possible without segwit, but channels would have to be time limited.

A 1.5 year long bear market where the price fell from 1150 to 180 is not a "minor correction". 
You can only zoom out to a maximum of 9 years.

This highlights a problem with talking about satoshis.
What you wrote there is wrong. ***1 millibit = 100000 satoshi.*** (1 mBTC = 1/1000 BTC)

Target increases. If target increases, then difficulty reduces.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:12:37
True, but keep thinking that way and you will just find BCH in the same place as bitcoin: With blocks full long ago and in need of some way to handle the demand of 1 billion+ transactions per day globally.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:34:55
Yes, minor corrections.
- [Minor corrections such as falling from $1150 to $550 in a two day period.](
- [And then falling to below $200 over the next year after that.](

If you add 10 million Uber payments to BCH tomorrow the fees would make it unusable for direct payments to Uber. 
The same problem that direct bitcoin payments have.
At least bitcoin has Lightning to attempt to solve this problem.

Why repropagate? Most nodes see it already, it has been propagated across the network already.
"Re-propagating" it (broadcasting it from a single node again) isn't going to make it confirm any faster.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:01:36
At least bitcoin has lightning on the horizon to attempt to solve this problem.
Does this satisfy your pedantry?
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:56:57
That is my point. 
A 1.5 year bear market in a short 9 year BTC history. So 16% of the entire bitcoin history was a continous bear market... and that is ignoring the other "minor corrections" that lasted many months.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:22:29


What I've been trying to say is that it didn't. 
Others reproduced the issue and OP reproduced the issue with other addresses. It is virtually impossible that a QR bug is producing valid but wrong addresses.

Bluetooth file transfer. Once paired it's easy to shared copied text from android to your computer at any time.
Your computer receives it as a text file. Works well with osx/linux/windows.

Ok so we're on the same page.
I think there is a good chance he will be able to recover the funds. Either his blockchain.info wallet can access that address or coinbase can. (Or some malware can and he is screwed.)

That is the exact opposite
of what he just said.

Aren't you a core dev? How are you misunderstanding this?
A seed is what is used as the intial value for a random number generation process (the seed of the RNG) to generate all the private keys in the wallet.
The seed is not the private key(s).
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:02:57
You think that was guaranteed, in the minds of the devs 6 months ago?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:00:51


The difficulty reduces by 20%.
There is no "1000 + 4000" or " 1000 * 4" anywhere. The target increases by 25%, which implies difficulty increases by 20%.
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:33:50
No it isn't fair enough, stick to your guns. This is as impossible as anything gets. If we want to get ultra-pedantic we can say anything is possible because we are *possibly* living in a simulation so maybe I can just walk through walls and levitate things with my mind if I try hard enough. Technically this may be possible.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:32:19


Unless malware then NO. It can't. We can rule that out. If the scanner manged the address then the funds wouldn't have sent.

Actually matter can be created, given energy.
I do see your points though.
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:37:24
Or pedantic?
@_date: 2016-11-02 04:33:17
No, transactions are signed with a private key. Private keys can be generated from the seed.
The seed and the set of private keys that can be generated from it are two distinctly separate things.
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:36:17
This will confuse people who don't have a somewhat intimate knowledge of cryptography/math. Keys are secure and it's ok to say that it is impossible to crack them.
In the practical sense of the term, it is absolutely impossible.
It's possible I'm Neo in the matrix, but virtually everyone will agree it's ok to say I'm not Neo and we aren't in the matrix. Assuming matrix-like bullet dodging is impossible is a better working assumption for life than assuming that we are in some computer simulation.
Assuming bitcoin private keys are uncrackable is impossible is a better working assumption than assuming that it is "possible".
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:42:37
Lol. Those are puzzle transactions where keys were intentionally easy to find (compared to a normal private key situation).

No, MtGox operated with incoming deposits enabled (both fiat and btc). Withdrawals were disabled (both fiat and btc).

You only quoted half of his sentence. I can't tell if you agree with him or not.
point is your point, they are *obviously* on the blockchain, not the bottom of the ocean or somewhere else, and the headline is therefore about finding their specific location in the blockchain.

Before the $1200 peak for example, the historic high at the time was $500. Then $600, then $700...
You know that the historic high of $1200 corrected only because you have hindsight knowledge that it actually was the "final" high.
