This is the first analysis of the what-could-have-happened, that does seem possible to me. People cannot get them to resend hundreds or thousands of really big transactions without getting gox to wonder about the failed transactions.
Just as I cannot order a book from amazon a hundred times and claim a hundred times that it did not arrive...

But with tens of thousands of BTC it will get suspicious very quickly. You had to claim the failed transaction manually from the support, do you?

I get about 2400 attempts per second on my not-so-special desktop computer.
€: Even assuming I would knew the third word (because the third word is not 250K) it will still be 250K x 250K x 10 = 625M.
That alone would take me 8 years. And no, I do not know the third word.

Thank you for that. That clears up how other cryptos that will be mine out earlier can possibly work. Did not think of the fees.

Maybe they try to collect account names, adresses and possibly even passwords. So in case of an insolvency they can claim funds and pretend to be the account holder.

Golds intrinsic value is not even close to what people are paying for it. It is not rare, it has limited use in technology. It is just worth, what people are paying for it just to have it.

Yeah, I always include a fee. But the questions remain:
How much? And: And can my BTC get stuck/lost when I enter 0 fees?
To the 5 mBTC: Default Android wallet. Has no settings for fees.

You mean the chances that another guy accidently uses an address that has formerly belonged to gox? And he happens to move thousands of coins too? Do your math, never ever ever.

Well done. Unfortunatly noone confirmed that ASCII as searchspace is enough.

ssdbitcoincabbage4 is not in your search space as well as altaquafarmsupplex2
right? So why only 4+ words? :)

I know his story. It was on reddit before. He didn't even sound to concerned about the loss of 14k BTC, he has plenty.

$620 per BTC that is some time ago, is it?

Transaction fees for small transactions: I am using electrum on the PC and the Bitcoin wallet on mobile. I can enter the tx fee manually in electrum, the mobile app uses a default fee with no questions asked.
I usually enter 0.0001 BTC as fee in electrum, has worked fine so far. But I did a transaction with the mobile wallet, and the automatic tx fee of a 7 mBTC transaction happened to be 5 mBTC. Ouch. (Had a lots of small inputs into that address.)
How do I choose the 'right' fees. And can my BTC get stuck/lost when I enter 0 fees?

I bought Humble Bundle with BTC only a few days ago. (From Europe, without any workarounds or tricks. Just "the usual way".)

And slightly related: I know it is a far stretch, but if the reward of new blocks is 0 in 100+ years, there will be no reason to mine. So no one will confirm transactions, won't they?

**TLDR:** Even the best computer that can theoretically exist would take more energy than our sun can deliver in billions of years to crack a encrypted bitcoin wallet.
