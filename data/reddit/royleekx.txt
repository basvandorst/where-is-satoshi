If your bank stole your fiat you wouldn’t say it was a bad currency format. You’d say it’s a bad steward of money. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:36:24
You’re wrong in the sense that you’re responding to the idea that bitcoin will be the native currency of the internet by arguing that it isn’t currently. You’re stating that it cannot become something greater than it is because it hasn’t yet. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:30:25
Yeah. And you’re creating something with actual utility so it has to be practical. I’m just releasing something I’m working on for fun. Different goals for sure. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:42:38
You’re right. We should ignore any positive mention of bitcoin and only focus on doom and gloom. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:33:54
Funny enough, I am working on a novel currently and am planning to self-publish exclusively accepting bitcoin. It’s probably not very good but it means a lot to me and I plan to accept BTC donations for it if anyone likes it. Still a few months away. I hope it goes well for you!

It wasn’t really ironic. He acknowledged that they feel like they have to try to moderate the behavior on Twitter, but that eventually that won’t be possible on most of the internet if it adopts blockchain.

You’re looking at in only in its current (infancy) form. You could’ve said this about gold when it was first discovered. It takes a while for something to become a store of value and a widely-accepted unit of exchange.

That’s fair. It’s my ignorance assuming everyone lives in the US. I didn’t think about the job market in other places.

I wonder who is paying for that patch? Any idea?
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:06:32
You realize all stores of value follow a life cycle in the same way bitcoin is developing? Gold wasn’t immediately valued as a currency with perfect utility when it was first adopted. It started as a collectible and grew in utility. Bitcoin is following the path of every asset, it’s just still in an early stage.

I’ll buy a ticket every once in a while. I’m just throwing away $2 for a nearly-impossible chance to win a shit ton. People who are hard-line anti-lottery are obnoxious. I waste far more than $2 on shit I don’t need. Obviously some people spend hundreds on tickets. That’s stupid, but it’s bizarre how condescending people are about buying a single ticket. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:22:41
Yeah I don’t think I’ve ever fantasized. I usually forget I bought one until I clean my wallet out. That might be true of some people. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 06:10:50
It made the rest poor? Assuming you’re talking about the people who bought at the ATH, that’s hardly “the rest.” The majority of people who own bitcoin are neither millionaires nor suddenly impoverished.

Technically not misleading. Bitcoin.com could easily be argued as a shortened name of Bitcoin Cash for domain purposes. They also allow you to buy bitcoin. They aren’t selling BCH under a fake name. They are absolutely misleading people, but not in any way that could concretely be considered illegal. It’s also not subject to US law even if it was. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:37:07
The same was true of gold until enough people valued it and were willing to exchange goods and services for it. Nothing has instant, stable value from the very moment it is discovered or created. To say that bitcoin will not become useful for exchange or storing value based on these early stages of development is to hold it to a standard of comparison that is impossible to meet for any asset that has ever existed or will ever exist. Ultimately I don’t think you are looking for answers. You want to assert that it’s a waste of time and money. I won’t be able to convince you otherwise. Only time can prove it one way or the other.

You don’t understand the history of gold. How could something be used as currency before it was a store of value? 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:43:24
It’s also not hard to realize that once the rest of infrastructure develops they won’t have to cash out anymore. Also the owner can keep profit as bitcoin if they want.

If quantum computing is a threat to BTC, it is also a threat to every other encryption-based technology in society. We won’t be worried about bitcoin being compromised. We’ll be talking about the whole world being compromised. I believe we will develop mechanisms to thwart this.

Even so, it was operating under the hybridized government structure we’ve adopted since abandoning capitalism long ago.

I’ll echo the sentiments of recommending Cash App and Uphold. Uphold has a more complete service but takes longer. Cash App is incredibly easy and fast but it’s limited in utility. The comment above mentioned Bisq, which I’m interested in trying. I, too, failed to find an exchange that worked until I found Uphold.

Are you attributing the U.S. healthcare system to capitalism? The current system is definitively not a capitalist enterprise. The government is literally forcing people to buy insurance.
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:44:06
You’ve heard of every important person? And, yeah, people tend to stick with traditional financial mechanisms until they have reason not to. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:12:35
Nothing specific but it’s pretty logical. You gain nothing from people knowing in general, other than to be a potential target for robbery (or ransom if we are talking big amounts.) Beyond that, it’s probably best for the government to know as little about your holdings as possible depending on how the future shakes out. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 05:43:33
The United States were definitively capitalist until the early 20th century

I sold all the bullshit and invested it in bitcoin. Alts are currently tied to bitcoin anyway in terms of price. I suppose that could change, but I don’t see you recovering your losses on alts and still getting a good price on BTC.

Disillusionment with current financial structures is a key component to bitcoin adoption. Someone with his audience telling people that bitcoin is way out of corrupt systems is big, positive news.

He’s supporting others. He wasn’t banned. If bitcoin was limited only to the audience it had in 2009, it would never grow. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:30:11
I agree it’s already old arguing about it but it’s not properly described as “his” drama. He’s just accepting a currency and people hate him so much they have to cry about it.

This type of reasonable argument is too hard to argue with, so I’ll just say, “He’s a nazi chauvinist and so are you.” 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:12:19
I’m not saying he’s incapable of using his influence inappropriately. There isn’t a man on earth that can be fully trusted. I’d need to see something more concerning in his behavior before I’d be truly worried about. That’s just my feeling though. Your concerns might be valid. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:07:49
You really think people will see his name on a message board and be discouraged from using bitcoin? You’re not giving people much credit. If someone would be silly enough to stay away from bitcoin just because Jordan Peterson accepts it for payment, they’d find hundreds of other reasons not to participate as well. It’s not a political statement in any way. It’s a big deal that a guy with his reach is accepting bitcoin. It means we might see the dominoes fall with other influencers. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:50:48
Cash App worked fine for me after I emailed support. They basically didn’t answer any of my questions, but after the response, transactions started going through. I tried like hell to get CEX to work but neither of my banks allowed it. I agree it’s frustrating. I just had success using Uphold to buy some XRM. You basically have to try several options to get anywhere. The first app that works smoothly is gonna be huge.

My understanding is that you “gain” nothing concrete but you do gain a way to facilitate and see your own transactions, as well as contributing to the network (for the greater good of the network, not yourself.)

@_date: 2018-12-28 00:02:42
So it can’t ever have new supporters? Sounds like a good way to stall the progress of bitcoin. The guy is busier than you could ever imagine. He’s supposed to also have unimpeachable knowledge of cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:32:30
Weird. I’ve read his books and listened to interviews and lectures. I’ve never seen him incite hatred. You sure you’re thinking of the right guy?
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:57:02
I agree with all your points other than Jordan Peterson kicking out Marxists. If he really did start his own platform, there’s no way he’d start kicking people off after starting a new one in response to being banned himself.
