I believe that they are developing a new site.  At least from what I was told.

Sorry for the confusion.  
I was asking for more information about the snippet about the interview where they claim users are reporting unfilled buy orders in the 170-180 range.
I myself didn't experience the problem.

Or maybe that his multiple stashes of 50 Bitcoin are shrinking in value.
Wait... shhhhhh.... move along.

Is there a link anywhere to people reporting that their orders in the 170-180 range didn't get filled?

I completely agree with this vision.
I have spent the last 2 years working hard to try and get my team's product, Moneypot.com, to cater to this.
 A quick and easy web-wallet at your fingertips, giving you easy access to multiple coins is something that I believe is absolutely needed.  Even the most experienced cryptocurrency users have problems with bitcoin wallets and altcoin wallets.
While this system lacks decentralization control, it can provide alternative benefits to the end user such as multi-signature processed transactions by video verification, phone calls, gpg signatures and more.  Filters can be made to protect the user from foreign ip access and enforce withdrawal limits to prevent theft or typos.  Users can send instant peer-to-peer transactions off-chain with zero fees.  
Decentralization I think is the end goal, but honestly I don't think we're there yet. I believe a partially centralized service that takes advantage of decentralized solutions is the best way to arrive there eventually.
