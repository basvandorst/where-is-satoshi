@_date: 2017-12-16 15:40:52
Ifnyou wsnt to support my new cryptocurrency youtube channel it would mean the world to me. I don't support or promote bitconnect at all and bring daily videos on all things cryptocurrency with some humor in there as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:08:12
I would be willing to teach you about crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:36:48
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:45:19

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:22:40
Seriously why would i lie about something like that ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:39:43
I'm not messed up. I'll do it  !!! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:32:17

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:34:19

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:23:36
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:15:03
Yes posts about ripple and xrp stay  ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:50:21
My question had nothing to do with your question which i did answer by the way, can't say the same for your contribution. Thanks for proving my point though. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:47:00
You can run anything through the sha256 hashing function or algorithm and you will end up with a private key. Hash you 12 or 24 word seed and you get your key. But DO NOT DO IT ONLINE !!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:52:30
I honestly believe they had an internal algorithm running on fork which only allowed certain balance to recieve. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:43:21
All in or nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:15:38
I just tried that but was flagged immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:12:56
So a million and you show an non working example? 
I am absolutely losing faith that bitcoin could have ever come from such an amazing close supportive and respectful community it was when i joined. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:39:30
How did you end up in r/Bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:43:28
It's deep 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:11:02
Not sure about that but you can do it completely offline for security 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:51:20
Were you looking for something more than a simple yes it is down to the question in your original post "antpool website down" 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:12:06
Post in the github 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:26:47
I was asking a serious question. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:17
Only one place lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:53:06
I just tried and mine shows BCH 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:13:51
Posted a song about bitcoin, cryptocurrency and the issues we are all dealing with in this ecosystem. Flagged 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:23:41
I can hash is for you if you like. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:02:41
Try reloading it may have switched but i wouldn't risk it if it isn't anything but a small tx
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:52
Not really what ? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:42:10
Am going to be giving away a ledger nano s as some opendime ltc wallets soon. Sub to stay tuned
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:23:30
Yes as always. Why you using antpool again ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:02:14
Guess I should have posted a bitconnect affiliate link or promised some 50x scam coin pump and dump those seem to be doing real well these days. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:33:46
I already have some serious ink anyway like it will matter plus I'm not just gunna do some lame $50 stupid generic tattoo I'm talking real artwork. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:02:10
I have sold many items for btc out of your area always use notable escrow 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:24:00
Initial cost of work uniforms, non slip shoes, car, gas ? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:39

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:20:32

@_date: 2017-12-17 03:54:42
You asked a question, got an answer. Then got offended i asked you one in return hahaha sound like a liberal loser 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:03:44
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:31:14
What does that even mean ? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:26:45
Why don't you use a reputable service that people have heard of  ? j/w 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:21
We can cross that one if this works out lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:08:04
Dollar cost average. Google it
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:49:43

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:07:40
You can check out my channel, Coin Junkie it's new and i have only posted a view funny videos thus far but got a ton of content and market analysis coming soon. Also check out crypto hedge
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:52:05
Your on wrong chain 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:29:01
I got my first bitcoins in 2014 @ $422 and i have been hodling ever since. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:42
Come out and show support for my new cryptocurrency youtube channel. I will never push scam coins or pump and dump shills. Just straight crypto dope daily. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:13:12
Listen to Bitcoin Rap "New Cash" by Coin Junkie  on 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:09:36
Ledger or trezor
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:25:54
Only pay taxes on fiat. Nobody taxes cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:32:20
And if it works out more than anticipated i am willing to get more than just bitcoin, maybe some others too but I'll let you decide. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:22:19
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:35:04
Why would that matter ? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:30:48
Pool ? Pic or it didn't happen ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:47:40
And i verified for you that yes it is down as always. And responded as well with a question as to why antpool which you immediately became super douche. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:09:30
Please give me some feedback as to how you all feel about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:53:43
I have been saying for weeks that greed will be what kills bitcoin.  I actually wrote a song about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:44
wow thanks man i worked really hard on it and should be able to put the entire track on my youtube channel soon. it is 4 verse track so got a lot of lyrical content in my opinion. thank your for your feedback though for sure
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:31:34
I might want to give that hug back !!! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:44:37
Fair enough, subscribe to my channel. Will be bringing some good stuff. And i think i am off to a decent start. Please do your part and show your support to others who support decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:27:23
So for all you trying to pick apart my statement. How about the single mom's out there struggling with two jobs just to pay for daycare ? Real world use case for my theory. Quit one job mine bitcoin in the basement and have more family time. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:08:18
Thanks lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:12:32
For example. I posted yesterday about coinbase stealing my btc. Flagged 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:29:28
Aww thanks for the hug. That wasn't directed towards you at all. But that doesn't make it any less true does it ? I mean bitcoin cash is even a thing today because bitcoin as a community does not all see in the same direction. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:17:49
For some reason it wasn't working lol. 
Don't forget the post about the satoshi license plate. How does this on topic yet missing fork coins aren't ? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:07:02
Do it man for the community. It's worth it lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:44:54
So how would i know so quickly antpool was down smart guy ? I have hash power pointed there so i wanted your reason behind it. Damn the noobs who buy an antminer and think they are all the sudden a bitcoin expert. They are slowly killing bitcoin. Whether or not this is you i don't know but your attitude toward another member of the bitcoin community (the people the general public used to see as outliers) speaks volumes to the type you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:22:29
Imagine waking up tomorrow and having two versions of Facebook and they both had the same history of posts, pictures and everything but something you post to one isn't seen on the other and vice versa. Also you have to pick which one you want to use and will not have all tge ssme community of friends after. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:45:54
Try The Coin Junkie channel. 
I  new to youtube but am a crypto veteran. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:30:07
Sure no problem. I own an s9 and use my daily payout average for the past week vs federal minimum wage in the USA which is $7.25
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:30:51
I actually looked and could find a single example of someone willing to let the community decide. This was actually an experiment in itself and i believe it has already proved well. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:03:25
Sorry lol that was for the mod who flagged my post being a douche 
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:05:43
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:08:43
Real bitcoin rap....
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:03:25
I would battle this any day...
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:31:12
What does that even mean ? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:24:17
Hahaha absolutely did. The numbers they sent me were in the millions. I almost passed out on the spot. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:29:20
Doesn't matter if it is a buy, sell or transfer it ia recorded and they report that $$$ amount 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:28:20
Wrong !!! If you used coinbase at all they report you. You could literally transfer the same 1 btc in and out of coinbase or gdax a few times and you now owe taxes on like $50k
