Your income from all sources (Salary/wages, CGT disposal events, etc) should be listed when you perform your yearly tax assessment. If that amount combined is less than &lt;$18,201, then your tax assessment would show "assessable income = $x, tax payable = $0... although there are other things such as medicare levy and everyone's situation is different. Do note that when you list it on your tax return you would include it in the section relating to CGT events, and you could list it as "Disposal of Digital Assets" or similar.

right click on Download and go to "Save link as..." - this process works in google chrome.
You may have to scroll to last page so the whole thing loads before doing the above process... thanks.

I'm in the 1% when it comes to karma maybe... but unfortunately still a guppy in the crypto world. If I was going to create a high quality book to give to friends and family, why wouldn't I share it with the rest of the world... The crypto world moves so fast that in 6 months the info may be invalid and any monetisation efforts would require marketing efforts of which I don't care for. Thank you to everyone who has been giving nothing but positivity and thanks... it has really made my day.

Thank you kindly.

no - but it was 2 months worth of my spare time outside of a full time job.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:30:49
you can find it on the kindle book store... but if you didnt want to pay for it. download the PDF and use amazons kindle software to turn it into kindle compatible... and copy it to your kindle manually.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:42:36
Thanks for the laugh.

You are welcome to share it - please help as many souls as you can.

In an industry already full of people which are more service to self, than service to others... and where greed flourishes. I think we could all use a good look at ourselves... and I hope this giveaway is refreshing to many. 
It is time that we all take our personal financial sovereignty seriously, and I hope this helps people to do so.
(and I giggle as I say this)... we must look like a clown show of lambo meme's to the outside world.

There are no scams proffered in the eBook. But your point does reinforce everyone's sovereign duty to perform ample due diligence.

That's OK... its the content that matters - and I am sure the value presented to those willing to overlook the spelling mistake are not only more likely to be those more deserving of the informative content, but also those likely to incorporate it. Thank you anyway.

the info in the AML Section is now fully VALID as the legislation was passed through Australian parliament a week or so after releasing the book... so the book speaks in speculative language for that chapter - however the Bill passed through parliament unchanged, and so the chapters content is accurate, but the speculative stance in wording is somewhat aged now. Additionally, the various global regulation seems to line up for around mid 2018 (July 2018) for a lot of countries... so what the landscape will look like 6 months from now is likely to have been changed or adjusted.

Yes - I never use EtherDelta without the Ledger Nano S plugin for the same reasons as the recent hack.

or on the 8th page for those that made it that far in... (hope you did)
"This document specifically &lt;b&gt;speculates&lt;/b&gt; on safety and certainty of crypto investments. It has a slightly more defined focus on currently existing regulation around the crypto world and &lt;b&gt;speculates&lt;/b&gt; on potential future regulation, tax, and other aspects of law enforcement so that potential investors do not get themselves into a mess of potential future liabilities."...

Yes - the book is available on Amazon Kindle... original RRP was $64.99... lowered it down to $10 when my desire to generate karma outweighed my desire to monetize the book. essentially I figure the knowledge needs to get out there... but so few will receive the information if I keep a price barrier of entry. So I release it here for free... left some donation details in it and those that have gained value from it - have the option to reciprocate.

60% of the book is relative to the global community. Have a look at the two "Security" sections... all people may find some very valuable info there. the other 40% relating to Australia is easily transmutable if you simply replace Australian tax rates or business structures with your countries offerings. The tax efficiency strategies are transmutable.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:06:31
yes it was a lot of work. you are all welcome in advance. Merry belated Xmas gift from me to the community.

yes - in Excel - Data &gt; New Query &gt; From Other Sources &gt; From Web... then the URL you are going to want to enter will look something like this.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:52:53
...and that is exactly what I hope it does.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:42:08
sure, you are free to redistribute it throughout the community. Share with friends, family etc...

I used Microsoft Word 2016 and NitroPDF.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:27:21
look for this book on the Amazon Kindle store... it is available from there also
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:52:51
there is a section regarding that in the book. truth be told - until the ATO makes a ruling on it specifically no one knows... so keep the receipts just in case you have to amend tax calculations in future if/when such a ruling were to become retrospective. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:59:56
funny enough - the draft bill wasn't changed before it was passed - all info is valid az. best wishes for a prosperous 2018. since releasing, two Australian Chartered Accountants have reviewed the eBook and verified my interpretation of tax law as spot on... so the book was good. I hope it helps many people... 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:55:15
Thank you kindly. The best way to donate is via the addresses in the book (last page)... as Amazon's Jeff Bezos gets most the money otherwise... The kindle thing s there for convenience... if you want - email the PDF to your amazon kindle address to get this PDF to your kindle.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:36:23
This month is your last chance to not regret that decision (Feb 2018)... see you in October 2018 ;)....

Why leave Australia? a nation of great quality of living? Talk to Ernst &amp; Young - they will sort you out legally and you can move on.

Thank you kind sir.
