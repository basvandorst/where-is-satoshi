I wish it was far fetched. Imagine, that if you were in a business that involves accepting credit cards over the internet, storing customer credit card data, medical records, etc., in order to open up, you have to undergo a background check and pay a fee to receive a permit for running software capable of strong encryption. You have to renew the permit every year, you have to run extensive background checks on your employees prior to hiring, and whatever other cumbersome requirements they want to pile onto business owners.
And if you are caught running strong crypto without a license, you go to federal prison.
They already do this with MSB/Money transmitter licenses, AML/KYC laws, and the BitLicense.

I don't have faith in bitcoin's growth purely as a store of value. The only way that model could become sustainable, given the halving of the block reward every four years is with enormous transaction fees, which would tremendously reduce its utility. For them to continue going up in value, there need to be used in transactions - both people buying things, and people getting paid in it. As a result, I contribute to what I believe is the sustainable future by spending bitcoin at every possible opportunity. I do this without dipping into my savings.
Gyft is one of the companies that helps enable this kind of behavior, because they make it cheaper for me to shop at Amazon and other places by buying coins instantly from Coinbase, and immediately buying Gyft cards with them. Coinbase charges 1% in fees, Gyft gives back 3%. As long as the price difference between Coinbase and Bitstamp is &lt;2% it costs me less than using my visa card.

Bitstamp and BTC-e do not sell bitcoin. They provide a platform where people can buy and sell bitcoin. They make money by charging a small fee for every trade. The price you see is the price of the last executed trade. BTC-e's dollar price is typically lower because the market values BTCeUSD higher than BitStampUSD.
As far as the rest of the world goes, you seem to be forgetting about countries where banking infrastructure is nowhere near as developed as in the first world. There are over a billion people in the world with internet access but no access to banking services.

The credit card company does not accept liability for fraudulent charges - those costs are passed on to the merchant.

I can't tell if you are trolling or not, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. If you are, maybe someone else will read this and benefit from it.








Are you talking about the kind of escrow where you entrust your coins to a 3rd party, that holds them in escrow until delivery of the goods? This will be replaced with multisignature escrow soon, and become a thing of the past.
That aside, no one is forcing you to entrust your coins to a 3rd party in order to use bitcoin.






M-of-N addresses (multisig) are how built-in escrow (one of the most basic smart contracts) works. A special address (starting with a 3) is generated using the public key to an address you contro, the vendor's public key, and the public key of an arbitrator both agree onl, You deposit funds to this address. If the transaction goes well, both you and the vendor sign a transaction with your private keys to release funds. If there's a problem, the arbitrator gets involved. The arbitrator can release funds to the vendor, or force a refund (or anything in between) provided the agreement of at least one of ther party.
M-of-M (mutually assured destruction) is another simple possiblity. In this case, if you and the seller can't agree to terms you both find acceptable, the money would remain in limbo indefinitely.




You must live a very sheltered life if you believe this to be true. Even in the US, there are a LOT of unbanked people (and I'm not talking about illegal immigrants). None of these people can currently engage in internet commerce without substancial fees. In many other countries the situation is grimmer. For example, people in Serbia may have access to both debit/checking accounts and the internet, yet they can only sell goods online within their borders. This is the case in a lot of countries outside the first world.




I said predictable rate of inflation, not exchange rate. Also, the US dollar is hardly the only currency in the world. Believe it or not, bitcoin's volatility is actually superior to the pattern [some other currencies]( exhibit.




You can maintain account balances without a 3d party (ie. a bank). You can transact without need for a 3rd party to facilitate the transaction. In other words, you can maintain a balance and transact without counter-party risk.




Bitcoin is far more than just a currency and/or payment network. I was not referring to contracts that companies sign, and then have to take each other to court in the event of a breach. I'm talking about [contracts]( written in and enforced by the blockchain. 
Bitcoin is programmable money; in all likelihood, there are killer apps that no one has thought up yet.
The truth is if you live in the 1st world and trust your central bankers not to debase your currency and wipe out the purchasing power of your savings, bitcoin does not currently offer you much you do not already have (aside from cetain novelties, such as the ability to purchase hand made [leather shoes]( direct from Iran). It is foolish to assume that if it offers privileged 1st worlders nothing new it has no value, when it is a global phenomena.
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:51:42


Bitcoin can perform these functions more effectively than existing infrastructure. As long as it keeps evolving, while existing infrastrure remains stagnant, survival of the fittest takes over and bitcoin comes out on top. Even if someone comes out with a coin that has superior features, bitcoin has the network effect and killer features can be ported to it.

The reference client ignores transactions if it already has a transaction for the same inputs in its memory pool. In theory, some pool operators and/or largescale miners could be using modified versions of the client that instead accept a transaction for a given input that has the highest fee, but that's just speculation. Even if true, you would need to send your double-spend transaction with higher fee directly to a miner, as reference client nodes won't rebroadcast it.
Assuming everyone's using the reference client, then you would quite literally need to broadcast the double-spend within seconds of the transaction you're trying to double spend.

Huh? I never said they don't return your money. Let me paint a fictional scenario for you, to describe how it works.
Someone stole your card. The thief walked into Best Buy with it, and purchased $90 worth of goods with your card. You realize there's a fraudulent charge on your account, and report it. The bank/CC company reverses the charge - meaning, they take the money out of Best Buy's account, and put it back into yours. The thief is gone in the wind, never to be apprehended. Best Buy no longer has the goods they sold the thief OR the money they received from the stolen card. Your money is back in your account. The bank just returned your money without reaching in to their own pockets or apprehending the thief.
We all pay for this type of fraud - especially those of us who pay in cash. Lets suppose you're in charge of making executive decisions at Best Buy, you know that a certain percentage of credit/debit card transactions WILL be fraudulent, and you will out both the goods and the money received for them. The only reasonable solutions to this is to increase prices on everything across the board, while making it more difficult for thieves to purchase big ticket items with stolen cards by instituting a policy of requiring customers to present a government ID the name on which matches their credit card when making large purchases.
The banks and credit card companies simply give zero fucks about this. They charge you fees for having an account with them, they charge merchants fees for the privilege of being able to receive funds from you electronically, and they very rarely have to pay the costs of fraud resulting from such an easily abused system themselves.

Bitcoin is already many orders of magnitude faster than credit cards. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible after an hour, while credit card  transactions can take as much as 180 days to become irreversible. Until then, the trasaction can be charged back, and the money from it would disappear out of your account, if you were the receiving party of the transaction.

A miner could modify their bitcoind to drop lower fee transactions for a given sert of inputs in favor of higher fee transactions. However the rest of the nodes on the network (running the reference client) will refuse to propagate transactions for any inputs they already have a transaction for in their memory pool.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:39:19
This method will not work. Bitcoind is coded to ignore a transaction if it already has another transaction for the same inputs in its memory pool. Obviously miners could alter the code to accept whichever transaction for a given input has the highest fee, but all other nodes on the network will refuse to relay such transactions. This method could work if a miner was running a modified bitcoind, you submitted the transaction with the higher fee directly to them, and that miner found the next block.
To get the network to relay your double spend, you would have to broadcast it within a few seconds of the transaction you're double spending. Then there would be a chance that some nodes would relay your double spend, and it might wind up in the memory pool of some miners.

Does he want to use bitcoin's payment network, but receive fiat? In thta case Bitpay or Coinbase is the way to go. If he wants to keep it as BTC, then he just needs a QR code taped to his counter, and a watch only address on his phone to verify that funds are recieved. Keeping the address opened in blockchain.info on a browser is another way of verifying receipt of funds.
If he uses a payment processor, he can set it convert a portion of received coin (or none at all, for that matter) - useful if he wants to only keep profit from BTC sales as coin. He can also use Bitpay/Coinbase for physical sales - with a tablet or old phone, he can generate invoices for a dollar amount that will display a QR code for customers to pay to. This will make bookkeeping easier for BTC sales.
If he uses a payment processor, he also receives the added benefit of them assuming the risk for double spends (they can do this because they have double spend detection algorithms that run before marking a 0-conf transaction as paid). On the flip-side, use of a payment processor requires trusting a 3rd party, which some may consider unnecessary.
If he wants to accept bitcoin with no 3rd parties in-store without the bookkeeping headaches (or privacy implications) that may result from all payments being sent to the same address, he could use Armory (this would require a PC) to generate a new address when someone wants to pay. He could track cost basis of received coin by putting the USD total in the label for each such address. Alternately, he could use bitcoin-core's request payment functionality.
The ease of accepting it online without a 3rd party will depend on what system he's using for his e-store. Last time I checked, Magento is the only CMS with an up-to-date JSON-RPC plugin.

If you can prove the money was legitimately obtained (easier said than done), you can get it back. However, you will probably have to give a sizeable chunk of it to a lawyer. 
Sometimes, even with a lawyer's help, you simply can't get all of it back. Since cash is effectively untraceable, very little prevents them from seizing $X, while giving you a receipt for $Y and pocketing the difference. A lawyer will ask for at least $2500 to get your seized money back for you. If they seize $4000, you might get a receipt for $2578 instead. Even if you can prove the money is legitimate, you will only be left with $78 after lawyer bills.

For a large purchase in-store, a merchant could demand to see ID for 0-conf, the same way that today you have to show ID for large CC purchases, or allow them to photocopy your ID if you pay by personal check. It's conceivable that someone might use a fake ID, but most people won't be willing to commit a federal offense over several hundred dollars.
Another hypothetical solution is the combination of trezor-style wallets for signing transactions and POS systems which broadcast. Instead of using your own smartphone (which could have wallet software modified for double spends) to broadcast the transaction, you sign it and provide the merchant with the signed transaction to broadcast. 
Larger merchants could even conceivably sign contracts with miners stating that transactions broadcast directly to the miner by the merchant will not be replaced by a double spend, even in the case of a double spend with a higher fee. I don't know whether it would be possible to implement such contracts in crypto off the top of my head (as opposed to relying on courts in varying jurisdictions), but it is definitely a concept worth exploring.

Ok, I see what you're saying. You do understand that doing this could (and probably would) cause a chain split unless a supermajority of the miners are on board? Miners that haven't upgraded would be able to claim SW UTXOs, which would appear to be anyone-can-spend to software that is not SW enabled. In the event that a SW UTXO gets claimed by a non-SW miner (or anyone else, miners simply get first dibs), SW miners would reject a block with such a tx causing a chain-split. A UASF with minority hashpower behind it can have the exact same result. The hypocrisy of claming a hardfork is dangerous because it could split the network in two, followed by pushing what amounts to a HF disguised as SF (which carries the same exact risks as a HF) is astounding.

Thinking like this is necessary imho. Put yourself in the shoes of an executive and/or major shareholder of the legacy financial industry. You recognize that there is a paradigm shifting new technology that threatens to make your business obsolete. It's already too entrenched to outright ban. You could try to kill it, but attempts to kill an idea just give it more power. Even if you kill it, granting it martyrdom in the process, a new more resilient one would emerge. It's open source, so cat is firmly out of the bag,
But you have a legal obligation to your shareholders, and adapting to the new world is unacceptable, because it would require conceding a significant reduction in profits. What do you do? Hand in a letter of resignation, only to be replaced, changing nothing? If was in that position, infiltrate and coopt would be the strategy most likely to work as far as I could tell. Once that course of action is undertaken, divide and conquer tactics become necessary if part of the community catches on to what you're doing too early.

Storage space is cheap, and for the time being growing at least as quickly as the blockchain. Even if the size of the chain eventually outpaces growth in storage tech, every single bitcoin business that hands any substantial amount of funds (ie. Payment processors, exchanges, miners, etc) will have a powerful incentive to keep an unpruned copy of the chain. Then of course there will be enthusiasts who won't necessarily be doing it out of altruism: it doesn't take much mental gymnastics at all to reach the view that providing a benefit to the community helps insure that the coin they are hodling continues to be a good store of value.
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:54:27
The objections are not to LN or SW. SWSF is a bad idea because it introduces too much technical debt.

Exactly. OTOH, there is no track record of companies being attacked for explicitly opposing EC (although drawing attention to that fact will probably result in attacks, so things are less obvious to an external observer capable of thinking critically), so it's not a stretch in the slightest to interpret "no official stance regarding EC" as explicit support for it.

And many of those companies are completely irrelevant economically. Enable weighting, and you will see that only 23% explicitly support, but almost all are prepared out of business necessity.
With weighting enabled, 77% also have no official stance regarding EC, which makes sense as making their stance public (if they support it) will expose them to social media smear campaigns, DDoS, and other attacks that would be harmful to their business. Given that, one may just as well interpret no stance on EC as explicit support (especially when you consider that network congestion and rising fees have been breaking business models and affecting companies' bottom lines).

Without users to transact, and generate demand for the tokens on the network, the miners would have no one to sell their coin to. However without miners to protect from double spends, the tokens on the network would not hold the value or utility that the users expect from them.

Only if the hardware to run it already exists and is ready to go, otherwise there would be a lag during which the network would be less secure while new mining efforts were spawning. During this lag the price of the coin resulting from the PoW hardfork would crash. Additionally, if the new PoW is CPU friendly, botnets may be a problem too.
It's unlikely that the miners would ever go along with a gradual PoW change, where a new one is introduced and the old phased out over the course of a year or more, and any attempt to do a gradual change without miner cooperation will result in a chain split. But to try and change it overnight without their cooperation would be suicidal, unless you first ensured that there was $1200/bitcoin in electricity worth of mining power ready to go with their collective owners' fingers on the on button waiting for the signal, the price of the coin would crash. Even if you did ensure this, you would still be guaranteeing a chain split, with all the unpredictability of how the market would react, and which chain it would ultimately follow.
I personally do not think that chip manufacturer centralization as a big problem longterm. Eventually manufacturers will reach a point of diminishing returns, where each new generation of chips improves performance over the old less and less - we've been watching it play out with x86 chips for most of the last decade. Each generation of chips will be able to stay in service longer if each generation improves on the previous less and less. In the long run, I expect we will start seeing mining chips in devices that will capture and use the waste heat, such as water/space heater, which contribute immensely to decentralization.

At least we are in agreement that a sudden cutover would be catastrophic, and that the only way to successfully change the PoW would be to do so gradually, over a long period of time.
The point I am making is that a gradual PoW change is impossible without the cooperation of a majority of the **current miners**. If a majority of existing miners reject blocks produced by a dual PoW client as invalid, we face all the same problems as we would if a SegWit UASF is attempted without majority miner support.

Any real business in the economy, including illegal ones,  will be able to afford to run a node, and will do so because of the voting power that gives them as a participant in the network.
Keeping blocks small, on the other hand, will lead to corruption and centralization, because with small blocks Bitcoin can never be a general transaction layer, simply because TX fees would be too high.

I know how difficulty works. What I'm saying is that if all transactions are pushed to L2 solutions, mining revenues will shrink to the point that the amount of hashpower securing the network shrink to the point that it makes the network vulnerable to attack. 
In this scenario, the only thing that can prevent mining revenues from shrinking to the point that the network will become vulnerable (other than a HF to a different consensus mechanism), is if transaction fees climb to the point that on-chain transactions (including the opening and closing of payment channels) become cost prohibitive for most people. In this instance, the only way into LN for most people (other than getting paid via LN) will be to trust a 3rd party that will aggregate funds from multiple users for the opening/closing of channels to distribute excessive fees across many users (sounds like the kind of business companies Coinbase would get involved in). This will literally turn bitcoin into a settlement layer for banks/corporations, where they get all of the benefits while the current status quo is maintained for users.
Additionally, big blocks will not significantly increase the difficulty with which user can download &amp; verify the entire chain, only the difficulty with which they can store the entire chain. Pruning nodes still download and verify the full chain, they simply discard most of the data after verifying it.
This is why I believe an artificially constrained block size will harm decentralization much more in the long run than big blocks, despite the fact that big blocks may reduce the number of full nodes on the network. I'm not opposed to L2 solutions for scalability, but I have an issue with deliberately crippling the network via an arbitrary block-size cap in order to make L2 solutions more attractive. I think, at the very least, the block-size should be raised to between 4 and 8MB (SW aside) so as not to constrain organic growth while L2 solutions are developed to a similar level of user-friendliness that on-chain transactions currently enjoy.

With small blocks and consequently high fees, why would I (or anyone else) want to use bitcoin in the first place? There's nothing special about it, other than the fact that it came first. The fact that it came first in no way makes it the best. The market will select the chain with the most utility, and the likelihood of that being bitcoin if blocks are kept small is exceptionally low.
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:29:32
Unless someone devises a decentralized routing algorithm for LN, the idea that big blocks will harm decentralization more than SW+LN is laughable. As things are today, LN hubs will literally be PayPal 2.0.

I can't prove that it won't work in a decentralized fashion, because it is impossible to prove a negative. If you assert that it will work, the burden of proof is on you by default.
You can dispel this FUD very easily by providing providing evidence. For example, a link to a guide to set up a node. I'll believe it if I can set up my own node, and can reliably use it to transact with entities that I don't have a direct payment channel to, **I will not hesitate to admit I was wrong.** In fact, I would very much like to be wrong about this.
In absence of reproducible real world evidence that LN enables transacting with entities who you do not have a direct payment channel to, who do not have have a payment channel open to the same hub as you, I will maintain my skepticism.

This problem will be solved with the release, and subsequent maturation of hardware wallets. Even without them, it's not as cumbersome as you make it out to be. While you do need an offline computer to generate your keys, if you print a bunch of paper wallets, (assuming you have access to an Android phone/tablet) spending from them is as easy as scanning the QR code, entering the amount you want to spend, and the receiving address. You don't have to worry about change addresses either - the Mycelium wallet returns any change back to the cold storage address. If you consider this to be a security risk, you can send the remaining funds to another paper wallet with a second transaction.

The crash was in April. The fork was in early March - before the price broke 65. The community response to the problem addressed my concerns on this matter. In a matter of hours the devs identified the problem (it was caused by a bug in the BDB library Satoshi used, rather than something he wrote) AND all the operators of major mining pools rallied to synchronise the version of bitcoind their pools were running. Faucets were emptied to (partially) reimburse miners who saw losses due to the fact that their pools were mining the discarded fork (there were several hours worth of orphaned blocks as a result). Overall I think the community dealt with the issue at least as nimbly as a centralized organization would have.

When you're holding the reserve note, that's an IOU from the bank to you - a debt from the bank to you. While such a system may be acceptable as long as no new debt is created, I only find it acceptable if the system is transparent. Unfortunately, they still haven't open sourced the Ripple backend. With a bank, anyone can redeem gold assuming the bank still has it; this requires trusting the bank. Until they open up the backend for Ripple, you have to trust OpenCoin to be honest, and not to create debt out of thin air.

Bitcoins are real money. If you're asking how to convert your bitcoins to fiat, it would help to know what country you're in. You could sell them on Coinbase and receive the money as an ACH transfer to your bank account a couple days later (US only). You can sell them for cash or a cash deposit to your bank account on localbitcoins (bitquick.co for cash deposits as well). 
Or, since they are real money, you could just buy things with them. If what you need to purchase is not available for bitcoin, Gyft is an excellent intermediary that lets you purchase gift cards with BTC.

When you keep your coins in a Coinbase wallet, it's similar to depositing your money in a checking account. Except there's no insurance policy covering your funds if the bank gets robbed, and no FDIC that will reimburse your deposits if the bank goes under.
Coinbase is great for buying and selling, but I personally wouldn't store my money there. It comes down to whether you trust yourself to secure your money, or prefer to place your trust in their security team because you yourself are not knowledgeable about computer security, factoring in that they have an absolutely giant target painted on them as far as hackers are concerned, whereas you do not (which won't protect from keylogging malware).

Mayment methods vary, but may include cash in the mail, western union/moneygram, and cash deposits to bank accounts. You can use an escrow service if that makes you more comfortable. If buying BTC like this from strangers in IRC is just too shady for you, head over to  and see if anyone in your area has Bitcoins for sale. Localbitcoins has escrow - you'll arrange to make a purchase, they'll put the coins in escrow, you'll meet and pay them, they'll release coins from escrow.

People creating trojans and/or phishing sites for the purpose of financial gain is nothing new. Bitcoin is a new avenue for them, which has become rather lucrative following the most recent price runup. The difference is, if someone steals your credit card number or PayPal login, and makes fraudulent transactions you can initiate a chargeback. This protects consumers from fraud, but shifts the burden onto the defrauded merchant (PayPal/Visa sure as hell don't pay for this kind of fraud). Bitcoin, with it's irreversible nature, shifts responsibility to the user. If your computer is compromised and your coins stolen, you have no authority to turn to for recourse. You have much greater freedom with bitcoin, but it comes with increased responsibility. 
These are mostly growing pains that will be solved with a variety of approaches including hardware wallets and/or dedicated devices that could enable self-hosted 2 factor authentication via M-of-M/M-of-N transactions. Since the tech is still in its infancy, these solutions for improved security are still being built, and only exist on paper for now. Having to assume responsibility for one's own security, with no out-of-the-box solutions to improve it is one of the burdens we have to deal with as early adopters.
Hacking is an issue that is by no means exclusive to bitcoin, but bitcoin's decentralized nature can make its effects felt much more accutely by victims.

The operator of the ATM has an account with a USD balance at an exchange. The ATM purchases coins at the exchange and withdraws them via API (there may be another wallet involved which keeps a small reserve of coin to avoid any potential lag in withdrawing from an exchange). The cash that goes in to it gets deposited at a bank, and wired to the exchange to replenish the USD reserve there. At least I think that's how it was described as working when I read about it a while ago.

Anyone who knows your bitcoin address can view its balance and transaction history. A wallet is typically a collection of many addresses, and their associated public keys. Most clients (with the notable exception of MultiBit) use something called 'change addresses.' When you make a transaction from a given address, leftover coins in your address are moved to a change address as part of the transaction (it looks something like [this]( This makes it difficult for an outside observer to tell which address you sent funds to, and which is your change address. This improves your privacy, and potentially improves security as well (your wallet address is a hash of your public key; when you make a transaction, you broadcast your public key to the network, and if ECDSA were to be broken in such a way that it became easy to compute a private key from a public key - something currently impossible, wallet addresses with a non-zero balance that have had outgoing transactions could become compromised as a result). MultiBit, blockchain.info, and most mobile wallets return change to the originating address, rather than a change address.
Because all balances and transactions are public, it is good practice to generate a new receiving address for every single transaction.

You could use MultiBit or Electrum on your PC without having to sync the entire blockchain. Blockchain.info is an acceptable online wallet - because it handles all crypto client side in JavaScript. I would not use Coinbase as an online wallet for a couple reasons - they control the private keys to your coins introducing counterparty trust, and they can be slow to send coins (they've been better lately).
If you go with blockchain make sure to pick a strong password and enable all security features. You'll want 2FA on the email you associate with it since they send you a backup of your wallet. Also keep in mind that you have reduced privacy with blockchain because it doesn't use change addresses by default.

If you really want to help bitcoin, do so by spending it at every possible oppertunity, even if you have to inconvenience yourself to do so. The best way to get more merchants to accept it is to give them a financial incentive to do so - money talks. In parallel, we need to be encouraging small businesses to start accepting it. More places to spend coin at means more coin gets spent, which encourages even more businesses to get on board creating a positive feedback loop. In addition, more demand for BTC as a medium of exchange will raise the price floor.

The payout isn't static. It gets cut in half every 4 years. In addition to the block reward, miners also receive the fees from the transactions they confirm (the transactions in the block they mine). As the block reward shrinks, the amount in fees the miners earn should increase through increased usage. Alternately, if the developers don't lift the 7 transactions per second limit, the fees themselves will increase, and bitcoin will become only for moving large amounts of money. In such a scenario, small transactions such as buying a pack of gum would move offchain (or to an alt-chain).

You are correct that it isn't *all* bad - fractional reserve banking is largely responsible for most of what you see around you - it enabled us to build up our civilization very quickly because entrepreneurs were not limited by the amount of hard currency to implement their schemes.
However, at this point in history FRB has served its purpose. It is hopelessly dependent on endless growth and consumption, and for this reason is unsustainable.

Coinbase is the easiest; Bitstamp would only make sense if you needed to buy a large volume - for small amounts international bank wire fees will eat up any savings you would get if there is a spread between there and Coinbase. If you want coins anonymously, use localbitcoins. If there's no local sellers in your area you can still purchase coins there or on bitquick.co, via bank deposit to a sellers account. You don't have to show ID for this method, but you will obviously be caught on camera.

For it's usage to spread, we need adoption by way more businesses to adopt, and for that there needs to be a financial incentive. Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Seriously, if you're holding long term you have incentive to do this, as increased demand for BTC as a medium of exchange will raise the price flor, making your coins worth more in the long run. Bitcoin is not sustainable purely as a store of value in the long run because eventually Tx fees need to be making up the bulk of the block reward.

For the time being, storage space is growing while falling in price per GB considerably faster than the blockchain is growing.

Additionally, who says everyone needs to be able to run their own node from the DSL connection in their house? Businesses in the sector will always run their own nodes, because of a business need. As long as there are companies all over the world, in many jurisdictions, running full nodes, the network will remain sufficiently decentralized. Besides, who the fuck will bother to run a full node, if they can't afford the fees charged by the network for transacting on it?

Promoters won't be interested in using this service exclusively because the target market is too limited, while using it in parallel with a different service that accepts more traditional payment methods is going to introduce all sorts of headaches. For events that have limited capacity, there would need to be a way to adjust the number of remaining tickets through your service on the fly as tickets sold on a credit card accepting service. Without this, if they split available tickets between services, they could wind up underselling what would have been a sold out show (or have additional work in making more tickets available in the channel that sold out first, while reducing the available number in the slower selling channels).
I would look into whether any sites like Ticketfly or Eventbrite would be willing to partner with you. It may be possible to integrate their services into yours via API, giving the best of both worlds. OTOH, they may well decide that adding BitPay as a payment option simply makes more sense.

Depends which school of economics you adhere to. Personally I don't believe people who save money should be punished through inflation stealing their purchasing power, with the only alternative being to invest their money into something (which carries a risk of loss).
The correct word here is 'saving,' rather than hoarding. I do think that people who have savings in BTC should be going out of their way to spend BTC whenever and wherever they can - you just need to keep a separate stash that you spend from (that you immediately replenish upon spending).

The black market economy is a rather small portion of the overall BTC economy - I think it exclusively would support a price between around $7-15. Someone studied SR by scraping the site and published findings in January. According to them the site had about $2mil in monthly sales. I find it extremely unlikely that the SR has seen the same kind of explosive growth as Bitcoin has since Jan, since it's hasn't had nearly as much attention from the press.
BitPay on the other hand has seen explosive growth this year, and is now between 5 and 10 times as large as SR. A lot of other new players are appearing on the scene too.

You can no longer mine Bitcoins with a GPU - even if you have free power, there's a good chance the GPU would fail before mining back it's own cost. Buying ASICs currently has a negative expected return (unless you preorder and get very lucky - a much bigger gamble than simply buying bitcoin), and will continue to as long as the difficulty is growing exponentially. It may level off when we max our ASICs by hitting the physical limits of silicon.

If you sell bitcoin for PayPal, your buyers can initiate a chargeback. PayPal will always side with the buyer (and might even close your account fro selling bitcoin), and you will be out both the BTC and USD. There have also been cases where sellers didn't send BTC after receiving PayPal payment, and PayPal siding with the seller in the resulting dispute, so there's no way to win.
As a general rule, you can't buy bitcoins with reversible payment methods. The only innovators that have had any success at lowering the barrier to entry in this area are [Coinbase]( and [BTCQuick](

This is actually absolutely essential due to the spread between the price of BTC in CNY and USD (excluding Gox Bux), since there's no other way to perform arbitrage due to capital controls - at least not at the current spread. It would also improve liquidity, and raise the price floor by increasing demand for BTC as a medium of exchange.

Saving funds when you are at the risk of being robbed for your customers' money is a poor course of action (one of the results of the moves they made when they doubled their fees is that instead of holding the coin that is in escrow, they outsource the risk that comes with that to Coinbase).


Great idea. Let's give the company a corporate structure, when we already know that corporate entities turn sociopathic by nature.


How is this different from charging the sellers? The sellers pass the cost on to the buyers anyways. Do they have a policy in place preventing sellers from advertising the amount of a purchase that Coinbase claims as fees (in the same manner that credit card processing agreements used to ban vendors from offering cash discounts, thus revealing the hidden costs to consumers of credit cards)?


I fail to see what is unethical about this course of action. They found themselves in a method because their only competitor failed to invest capital into security, and was forced to shut down as a result of this. One of the direct effects of them increasing their fees was improved security, which directly benefits their customers. If the increase in fees is unreasonable, this creates an opportunity for someone to make a competing site, which is better for everyone involved. If they used another form of investment they would help ensure a continued monopoly - instead they raised fees which lowers the barrier to entry for a potential competitor that wants to enter the market.

In a fractional reserve banking system, all money in circulation exists as debt. This means, that for a dollar to be in circulation, someone had to have taken it out in the form of a loan, with a promise to pay back the loan + interest. If this seems confusing, I recommend you watch [Money as Debt]( It does a great job of explaining how the system funtions, and why it exists. 
Illustrating how deflation increases the debt burden is easiest done with an example. Suppose, you took out a loan of 5 BTC in early January. The terms of the loan dictate that you have to pay back the 5 BTC, and an addional .1 BTC by the end of April.

You forgot to mention paper wallets.
The ideal way to generate one is using a linux live cd (this way you take potential malware on your PC out of the equation), go to bitaddress.org, disconnect the computer's internet, and then generate an address, and print it out. You'll have the paper wallet's public address so you can make deposits to it, and you can spend the funds in it if you input the private keys into a client. Be wary of change addresses; the ideal method would be to import your paper wallet's keys, spend what you need to spend, and then send all remaining funds in the wallet to another paper wallet. Using a Linux Live CD is not necessary, but it adds an extra layer of security, should the computer you use to generate keys be compromised.

Nothing prevents someone else from checking your address. All balances are public in the blockchain. To spend the coins at a specific address, you need that address's private key. Balances in addresses the private keys to which are lost are irretrievable.
This money, as you put it, consists of balance entries in the blockchain. A previous owner of your coins can't spend them again, because they have been transferred from an address he has keys to, to an address you have keys to. Once the transaction is confirmed, the balance is no longer in his wallet to double-spend.
I'm not sure what you mean by "the encrypted position," but if you're referring to your wallet.dat file - this file contains the keys to all the addresses in your wallet. If you put a passphrase on it, the entire file including all the keys stored in it will be encrypted.
We're mining balance entries in addresses we have keys to.
Regarding retrieval of lost coins - if a weakness were to be discovered in ECDSA that made mining private keys many orders of magnitude easier, the bitcoin software would have to be patched to use a different algorithm for keypairs. Since lost wallets would never get updated, it could become possible to recover lost coins that still use the old keys.

I'm not familiar with Southwest Gift cards so I can't comment on that, but in cases like the one with LTC-Wallet or the onion wallet, the answer is quite simple. Don't use any online wallets that perform crypto server-side (blockchain.info does all crypto in client-side in javascript) - it is the equivalent of trusting the service provider with your money. The fact that lots of people are trusting them with money paints a giant target on them, and there's no insurance of any kind since the industry is still in its infancy.
Type of fraud committed by people with dubious backgrounds can be avoided in the exact same way you would in the real world. Don't do business with individuals who set up shop in the digital equivalent of a shady alley. You can check to see if their domains have a whoisguard set or are otherwise registered anonymously. You can look for reviews on the internet, and avoid sites that don't have any. If companies make no information about their ownership available, or if their owners' have a non-existent internet footprint, they should generally be treated with caution.
It also sounds like there is market demand for a service that would be a hybrid between an escrow provider and payment processor. A company like this would operate similar to BitPay, but only offer direct conversion to USD with a 30-day reversal window on transactions. This could theoretically be accomplished if they hedge BTC payments by converting them into USD at exchanges upon receipt, and immediately paying the receiving business with a reversible transaction from a line of credit secured with the USD balances in their exchange accounts. In the event of fraud, they can reverse the transaction without taking a loss since the money from it is sitting at an exchange hedged into the fiat currency of their choice.

This happened to a friend of mine. He knew the bitcoin address of the wallet, and the password, but could not log in without the identifier; and asked me to help recover it.
After several back and forths with support including giving them the exact time of the creation of the wallet (but not IP as that information was not available), and it's BTC address, they said that the only way to recover it would be to share you password with support staff. They found it pretty quickly once that was shared.
I got the distinct impression that the only way for them to recover the identifier if the IP address you registered from is not available, is by a brute forcing wallets created in the right window of time with your password.
I know you shouldn't share your password (hope that at least you don't use it anywhere else), but it seems with the way their system is set up unless you have some rather specific information (like your IP address at the time of creation) or linked an email address to your account, that this is the only way to recover the identifier in such a scenario.

For one thing blockchain.info waits varying time for shared sends - especially for larger transactions, because there need to be enough coins in the shared pool to pay out different coins than the ones you put in. Nor am I suggesting you shouldn't wait for confirmations on a 250 BTC transaction, but for low value transactions - of the sort you would typically encounter in brick and mortar stores, it's not as large of an issue. I'm also not suggesting that people accept 0-conf transactions blindly - checking a transaction on blockchain.info can tell you if a double-spend has been attempted - ideally this should be integrated into a point-of-sale via API.
In the end it depends on the value of a transaction, and on whether any kind of double-spend detection is in place. Cases of double-spend fraud can be dealt with in the same way that people swiping stolen credit cards gets dealt with now.

This is correct. As long as a majority of mining pools continue to run an unmodified Bitcoin client it will remain the case. If a miner already has a transaction for a given input in their memory pool, their client will ignore broadcasts of transactions for the same inputs. 
Miners could theoretically modify their software to instead keep whichever transaction for a given input has the highest fee, which would make double spends much easier. For that to really make double spends easier someone with a LOT of hash power would have to do this, and our current ecosystem with centralization of hash power in pools actually makes such a turn of events less likely. If the operator of a large pool were to alter their client like his, the pool's users would probably leave in droves - since the operator's actions would harm adoption rates and confidence in BTC.

The fee goes to whichever miner includes your transaction in a block. Fees are typically determined by the size of your transaction. Fees exist to ensure a continued incentive for mining after the block reward drops to (almost) zero - the idea is that by the time the reward of new coins per block becomes insignificant, transaction fees will make up the difference. Right now fees are (semi) hard coded. In theory, eventually they will be determined by the free market.

Attempting a double spend is far from trivial, seeing as the reference bitcoind client will ignore transactions if it already has another transaction for the same inputs in its memory pool.
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible once they confirm. Compare that for a second to credit card transactions, which are reversible for 180 days after being made, which doesn't stop businesses from letting you walk out with your goods immediately after swiping your card.
Also, I'm pretty sure that bitpay does assume liability for double spends - they do this with a proprietary double-spend detection algorithm.
Accepting a zero-conf transaction is very different from saying "I believe you're good for it." To make an analogy to credit card transactions, "I believe you're good for it" would be the equivalent of accepting a credit card without waiting for the card provider to approve the transaction. With bitcoin, if you sent the transaction, you are obviously good for it, because the network won't relay a broadcasted transaction for coins you don't have.

Did you know that bitcoin has built-in trust-less escrow, in the form of m-of-n transactions? Means you don't have to worry about the trustworthiness of an escrow provider, since you're not entrusting them with any funds.
The confirmations aspect has already been beaten to death - in most use cases (excluding high value transactions), the risk of accepting a zero conf transaction is negligible.
Your claim that it's more expensive because of exchange fees and such assumes that the only way to obtain bitcoins to spend is by buying them, which is simply untrue.
Most of your points are critisisms of bitcoin in its infant state. Bitcoin is not static - it grows and evolves. The fact that 80% of the current code base was not written by Satoshi is proof of that.

All you need to create a wallet is a computer. No credit card, no proof of identity, no email address, no online registration of any kind. Download Electrum, and generate as many wallet addresses as you like, although if you're doing this for long term storage, you should make a paper wallet on an offline computer that will never go online again after generating your keys (you can accomplish this with a linux live cd).

I recommend [BestSeller on localbitcoins]( since he has the best rates. I've done a couple transactions with him through localbitcoins, and quite a few more directly without escrow since he offers a better rate that way.

I would pick Electrum over Multibit. It uses change addresses by default (better privacy), and you can restore your wallet from the seed alone, as opposed to having to worry about backups. It does not require you to download the entire wallet either.
I would advise against using the same wallet across multiple computers as this increases your attack surface (ie. a keylogger on either computer, and you're hosed on both).
With Electrum, you don't necessarily even have to store your wallet file on a computer - just restore from seed as needed, then erase the wallet files after.

Unfortunately, it has yet to be implemented in the client. You can create multisig transactions from the debug console, however I'm not 100% certain that miners will accept them if they're running the default configuration. I had heard that it was to be implemented this year, but that was prior to the blockchain fork that occurred in March, so it may have gotten delayed some.

Your order is being delayed, because people who bought after you and are initiating chargebacks with their credit cards are getting their orders shipped in response to complaints being filed. If you paid with a reversible service, try initiating a chargeback/refund (this may be possible to achieve even if you're outisde the official reversibility window, by bringing up BFL's borderline illegal business practices), and they should expedite your order.

Once a BTC transaction is confirmed it is irreversible. A credit card transaction, on the other hand, is reversible for 6 months. It comes down to whether you define "confirmed" as availability of funds or irreversibility of the transaction. 
If BTC worked like credit cards do, you would be able to spend unconfirmed funds - at the risk of having the transaction reversed prior to it's confirmation and having to cover its amount out of pocket.

The problem with this idea is in order to set up such a business, you need to get MSB/MTB or equivalent licensing everywhere you want to do business in the western world. In the USA this requires a deposit of $15m for the federal license, and licensing in every state you want to do business or have customers in.

While it would be easy to hide income from the taxman for the individual, bitcoin would not instantly make all taxes voluntary. Property taxes would obviously not go away. Neither would sales taxes - businesses would eventually be forced to share all incoming addresses with the taxman, and taxes would be computed using entries in the blockchain. Audits would consist of surprise inspections or even simply undercover purchases. If a business fails to report the receiving address that the undercover agent paid to, at the end of the quarter they would find themselves in hot water. Payroll taxes should also be possible to implement.
On the bright side a drastic reduction in income tax revenue just might rein in runaway military budgets. Hell, retiring the debt based money with its printing presses would  do that.

Sending coins into a shared pool that pays everyone out what they put in (minus any fees), after mixing everyone's coins together, giving everyone different coins than what they put in while making the trail very difficult to follow (ideally a mixer erases all records of who got which coins upon paying everyone out).

If you can get a bank wire out now, but simply don't have a US account to send your funds to? If so you can deposit to an exchange by bank wire, but be prepared for about a weeks worth of delays for account verification. I would split the funds between Bitstamp and BTC-e, avoiding Gox entirely. If this works for you, you can hedge against volatility by maintaining a dollar balance at the exchange, however this introduces counterparty risk.
 If you can't send a wire because of your predicament (or ID verification delays are unacceptable), you could maybe buy a bunch via Western Union/MomeyGram on OTC markets, depending on what their transaction limits are. I wouldn't rule out transactions where you don't meet the seller face to face - as long as you use escrow. Depending on the specifics of your situation, they may be necessary to accomplish your goal.

The problem is with Gox. First, there's the fact that the US government seized $5M from them in April, and they simply may not have enough dollars available to satisfy everyone's withdrawals. There's also the fact that a LOT of banks want absolutely nothing to do with Gox because of their connection to Liberty Reserve (you could deposit LR into Gox).
I've heard rumors that GBP withdrawals are processed in a timely fashion, but the only thing I'm sure of is that domestic (Japan) withdrawals are processed immediately.

Most of the big banks (and some smaller banks) have definitely undertaken anti-bitcoin actions at one point or another. Chase is the only one I'm aware of that has a "no anything bitcoin" blanket policy. Sparkassen's policies sound like they stem from security issues resulting from compromised accounts sending funds to Bitcoin exchanges (BTC-e and BitStamp are blocked, but afaik you can still send funds to Gox). Bank of America and Wells Fargo have definitely both closed and/or frozen people's accounts for dealing in bitcoin, but they seem to be selective about doing so. Capital One is definitely on the shitlist (BitFloor and BitSpend both had accounts frozen by them, among others). Most UK banks have definite anti-bitcoin stances. I'm sure there's others I've missed, if anyone cares to add.

If that was all the funding they needed, why would they traffic drugs? It could of course be rogue elements in the CIA doing so to line their own pockets, or it could be something coordinated, for funding black ops with no oversight.
And to go a step further, even if USD printing covers their funding, it does not give them the means to easily send money to their pawns in foreign countries. Bitcoin gives them a means of paying their networks of eyes-and-ears without having money transfers to potentially hostile countries show up on the radar.

How do you envision this working technically? The reason a credit card scanner can instantly debit your account is because you give it the card number - in bitcoin terms this is the equivalent of the private key. This is OK because transactions are reversible. Having a machine automatically debit your BTC sounds great right up until someone figures out how to hack it to remove more funds from your wallet than it should.
I don't think the holy Grail is to make transactions function exactly like credit cards do now because Bitcoin is nothing like electronic fiat.

The way things work right now if you use escrow, you send your coins to the escrow service you and the vendor agree upon, the escrow informs the vendor that they have the coins, the vendor ships the product, and you release coins from escrow when you receive your product. If you never receive, the escrow service acts as an arbitrator, with the power to either complete the transaction, or refund you. Unfortunately, under this model, the escrow needs to be in control of the of the coins, exposing you to counter-party risk.
With an m-of-n transaction, the transaction is not complete until it has m-of-n signatures. Let's assume m-of-n, is 2-of-3, since that's relevant to this use case. You send the vendor a transaction, it appears in the blockchain, but they can't redeem it until it has 2 signatures. If everything goes well, the vendor signs the transaction with their signature, and you sign it when you receive the product, at which point the vendor is able to spend the coins. If you never receive a product, you get the escrow service involved to mediate. From here, the transaction can go a couple ways - mediator sides with the buyer, buyer gets coins back. Mediator sides with vendor, vendor receives funds.

Bitcoin is designed to be entirely trust-less. This is why the Satoshi client has to download and process the full blockchain - there's no other way for the client to know that your addresses definitely have a spendable balance.
If you use a light-weight client like Electrum, you have to trust the server your client reads the blockchain from. This in no way compromises Bitcoin's decentralized nature, but it can open the door to financial censorship, if the server maliciously reports that your keys have a zero balance. In the case of Electrum, this is currently not a big deal, since the server backend is open source. 
Overall, lightweight clients require a small measure of trust (unless you're operating your own full node &amp; backend server for blockchain verification), but there's still no way for a malicious server operator to steal or freeze your coins.

It may just be coincidence, or some link in the chain is compromised. Maybe one of Coinbase's new employees is a malicious actor, however I find it unlikely that their support dept would have access to the information necessary to accomplish such a scam. It could be that someone managed to (partially) compromise Coinbase's internal network via infected USB drops in/around their office. Maybe it could involves an XSS attack that hijacks the WF instant verification process? I'm just speculating on attack vectors here, and I must add that I don't see any irrefutable proof that Coinbase is in any way compromised.

It will eventually be possible to implement with 2-of-2 transactions. You have one private key in your wallet, one stored on a server. Your transactions would have to be signed with both keys before the network considers them to be valid. The problem with such an implementation would be that you could find yourself at the mercy of the server operator should they decide to be uncooperative. This can be resolved with either self-hosting, or using 2-of-3 transactions, where you have a 3rd key in a safe somewhere that can be used should the server providing 2FA go down.

Or with BitInstant, you can make an order to have them fund your Mt.Gox account with USD, or send you BTC to an address of your choosing, and pay for it with cash at any MoneyGram locations.
I would seriously consider trading on an exchange other than Gox right now - between their legal problems, and the fact that they have the most market share (which is bad for the ecosystem as a whole). Look into CampBX, or BitStamp.

When you invest USD in order to have more dollars than when you started, is your goal an increased number of units of currency or an increase in purchasing power?
You have to invest USD to get a return due to inflationary pressures constantly chipping away at your purchasing power. Since Bitcoin is deflationary (in the long run - it's still inflationary at the current stage, but this is easily offset by adoption growth) investing your coin in such a way that it multiplies is not necessary to increase your purchasing power over time. Just buy/earn and hold. Your coins won't multiply, but they'll be able to buy more next year than they did this year, so the end result is the same.

Deflation keeps getting brought up as a bad thing because in a debt based economy deflation increases the debt burden. It's effects on spending are secondary to that, although they always get brought up first. What the people who keep bringing it up fail to realize is that bitcoin isn't debt based, which introduces a flaw into their line of reasoning.
Historically, commodity backed economies with deflationary currencies have done quite well (USA pre-1917, London during the industrial revolution, to name a couple), which directly contradicts what economists like Krugman have to say on the matter.
Deflation puts power into the hands of those who save money. This does not suit the ruling class - not when on the flip side they can hold that power through control of printing press.

People who say bitcoin is anonymous don't know what they're talking about. It's pseudonymous. If you want full anonymity, you have to buy your coins with cash without exposing your identity (ie. Bitinstant-&gt;moneygram,   or localbitcoins) . This usually costs a premium, and you're limited to &lt;1k at a time due to AML regulations.
IMHO, the biggest advantages of Bitcoin are that its security is cryptographic (it can't be seized, you don't have to trust a bank to keep your coin safe) and that it can't be debased by Governments/Central Banks with a printing press.
Edit: You can also put your coins through a mixer to help anonymize after buying them in a way that links your identity.

There's no way it's going to get stolen, without you somehow exposing critical information (such as the password). This can include logging in to the wallet from a computer that has keystroke recording malware. If you have 2FA on the blockchain wallet, the password by itself won't let a thief access the wallet itself, but could allow for decryption of a wallet backup (if, for example, you have one on your computer, or in an email account not protected with 2FA).
If you plan on holding your coin long term, I would advise you to create a paper wallet, and store it someplace safe.

If you want to store them someplace you can cash in quick (sell for USD), you will inevitably introduce counterparty trust. Mt.Gox/Coinbase/whichever exchange you store them with could get hacked/disappear/get hit by a meteor, and your coins would be gone.
You should store them in a paper wallet. If you want to cash in, you can always move them to Coinbase (if you're in the US), and sell as soon as they confirm.

This math applies if you immediately convert to fiat when you mine. If you think the price is going to go up significantly, and can afford to invest into power now it makes sense to mine even if you aren't covering power costs in the present.

This is exactly why Amazon can afford to charge less - half the fee with 4x the volume results in 2x the revenue. I'd be curious to know what Amazon's fees were early on - a quick google search yields nothing relevant.


For a site like Coingig, they had two possible avenues for continueing to grow the site: increase fees, or seek additional investment capital. It's very easy to talk shit on the fact that they increased their fees without offering an alternative solution.

We need more places to spend them. Brick and mortar stores in particular. If you know business owners, encourage them to start accepting Bitcoin. Convincing large companies to accept them is an uphill battle, but if a lot of small businesses start accepting it, we will have more places to spend. Done right this should create a positive feedback loop where we have more and more places to spend (but only if more and more of us start spending).
I think that as a community we need to drop this attitude of "I have no desire to sell/spend my coins right now because I think they're worth more," because it will get us nowhere. Gold works as a store of value without being used in trade much, but unlike BTC gold has a long history as a store of value. The only way for BTC to reach a similar market cap (and be sustainable in the long run, since miners will eventually be competing for only Tx fees) is if it's being used as a medium of exchange to back a high price. If all of us are hoarding our coin, and not spending any, where is the demand for BTC as a medium of exchange going to come from? We can sit and hope other people/businesses start transacting in BTC more, or we can set an example by doing so ourselves.

How do escrows not reduce the rate of fraud? Unless you're referring to holding coins in escrow while doing a reversible online transaction, and releasing escrow before the reversal window closes.
Escrow is quite sufficient for protecting the buyer when purchasing physical goods. While currently, you have to trust the escrow provider with your coins to accomplish this, when 2-or-3 (m-of-n) transactions are enabled, escrow will be possible without trusting escrow service with any coins. The transaction needs 2 out of 3 possible signatures to be complete - the coins are in limbo until it is signed by the required number of parties. If everything goes well, both the seller and buyer sign the transaction, and it is completed. In the event of a dispute, the escrow provider (really just a dispute arbitrator now) can use their key to sign the transaction to either complete or reverse it depending on which party they side with.

The Fed's unlimited supply of currency functions by stealing purchasing power from holders of currency. With bitcoin, everyone's purchasing power increases. Infinite divisibility with a caped supply is the polar opposite of unlimited supply - increasing supply of individual units of currency by increasing divisibility does not dilute the value of the currency, it just makes smaller denominations possible.

Because the fiat banking system is antiquated, and largely incompatible with bitcoin because most types of transactions are reversible. With Coinbase you have to wait for the transaction reversibility window to close. The nature of the fiat banking system makes it so that getting your coins quickly and/or anonymously carries a premium.

That's the trouble with no-fee transactions - they can potentially get stuck in limbo for a day or two, and in some cases they drop instead of confirming.

It seems to me that one of the points of Bitcoin is your can be your own bank - you don't have to trust anyone else to store your funds. Deliberately introducing counterparty trust by depositing your coins with a third party seems backwards to me...
As for insurance, I don't see how it could ever become cheaper than insuring cash - and cash can't be stolen over the internet.
The problem with web wallets where you done actually control your coins (Coinbase and inputs.io both fall into this category, while blockchain does not) is that they need to keep private keys hot and accessible via API to enable users to spends funds without intervention from the service provider's staff. This paints an enormous target in them for thieves. They so provide convenience for people who don't want to deal with the rather technical nature of being responsible for their own private keys, but without any deposit insurance the tradeoff is rather poor...
