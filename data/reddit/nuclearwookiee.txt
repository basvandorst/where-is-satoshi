It produces a shit-ton of energy without burning fossil fuels, night and day and whether or not the wind is blowing. Even if you take into account incidents like Fukashima and Chernobyl it still releases less radiation into the atmosphere than coal, which is the only viable substitute.

As someone who has experienced the public school system , it's the absolute truth. Teachers are babysitters that society for some reason respects.

I wouldn't give a Dogecoin to those idiots. Their opposition to nuclear power in the 60s-80s kept us on coal and their opposition to nuclear power today is the height of ignorance.

No, they're not. They can't handle base load and are dependent on location and environment. 


Nuclear reactors generate electricity. Batteries don't.

I've run across few teachers that care about that. Teachers exist to indoctrinate, not to encourage independent thought. The markings on OP's son's paper represent the teacher doing his or her job.
