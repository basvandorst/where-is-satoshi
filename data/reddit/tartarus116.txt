We need more posts like this!

Don't know if I can find it again, but one publication, using a Monte Carlo simulation I've read suggested that the most likely price at the beginning of 2018 would be 6.5k. There was something like a 15% chance that it was gonna be over 10k.

We already knew they were gonna issue real name policies. It's actually generous that existing anonymous accounts can withdraw without being penalized.

Travelling salesman problem. It's part of the notoriously difficult P=NP problem. Here's a video about it:

I guess you could code a WhatsApp or Telegram bot and make it check a blockexplorer, then notify you on your phone when it's got a certain amount of confirmations.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:35:02
I second that. Woke up at 5am, saw the dip and checked reddit for news, only to find the story in every other post.

Roger and his friends are already planning 1TB blocks: 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:04:11
Of course it does. A fix for it is lightning hubs, which minimize the number of routing hops but also add to centralization and increase vulnerability to attacks. 
As for the mathematically proven not to work part, he's probably referring to the research conducted by Microsoft mathematicians that prove that any number of routing hops beyond a distance of 3 is vulnerable to attacks:

How about putting it on IPFS?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:54:23
I'm aware that he owns it, but this would affect the entire crypto market and bcash even more so (because alts generally slip more during a crash). Thus he has no incentive to fabricate it. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:13:02
Well, yeah. That's also what I do while I wait for crypto adoption to pick up pace. Altcoins are pure speculation at this point and I don't have any intention to keep them in the longer term. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:42:16
This is hilarious! :D

If you don't comply with AML/KYC laws you'll immediately end up in jail.

GDAX used to have an app on android (I still have it) but there are work-arounds to pin the GDAX web-version (gdax.com) to your home-screen (for iphones) to make it look like an app. 
Advantages are:
No deposit fee
No limit buy/sell fee
No crypto withdrawal fee (not even miner fees) 
Only 0.15 EUR withdrawal-to-bank-account fee
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:12:28
So it's essentially like BitInstant back in the day, but now it's not accessible by the general public? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:42:00
You should work with the devs on tackling these issues
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:50:48
They now claim that no coins were seized at all: 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:12:49
Don't even bother giving them your attention
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:01:05
idk, current daily chart looks like a huge bull pennant to me
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:07:29
With 6% premium though... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:43:30
How is it that so many people still don't know about GDAX (owned by Coinbase), which has NO fees at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:53:15
What's the point of bigger blocks? ETH has adjustable blocksizes (currently up to 35 MB or something) and yet the fees are increasing. A fix like LN is inevitable. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:29:57
Visa has suspended them, along with other card providers 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:28:09
What about this then?
It says it's too much of a burden for banks to introduce real name policies. Comments in the article are conflicting. Does anyone know what's true and what's not?
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:21:11
Because South Korea is considered to be a huge breeding ground for crypto currencies. Their citizens are totally nuts about it, which is why they're consistently 30% above market price. Also, they make up for a sizable amount of the combined crypto market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:39:50
I found no source to verify these claims. Did anyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:10:45
BTC deposits/withdrawals were delayed yesterday. That's why it's not showing the transaction hash.

same, we'll probably end up being filled at the very bottom

For those who want custom time frames, I've included the option, but it's off by default. And yes, you're right, alternate time frames can lead to repainting, which is why it's off by default. You're also right about Hekin Ashi, they're not a real representation of the price, but helpful for identifying trend changes more accurately with this indicator. I'm working on improving the results for normal candles (still fairly profitable, but not as much as Heikin Ashi). If you're interested give it a try and play with the options.

Kim Dotcom is working on one:
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:59:07
((7800 + 1000) * coins in circulation) - current market cap = amount of $ you need to spend to raise price by $1k, provided that the order book is evenly distributed (no 'walls')
For a more realistic guess, you'd look at the order book. However, you can't know for certain since you don't know how the market will react (whether investors remove/add walls or not). 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:56:04
Whoops, that's why I should not read while walking 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:50:33
I don't know what you're selling but OpenBazaar could be an option

You should have at least a rudimentary understanding of programming. Take 2 weeks to go over the basics of Python and then watch some YouTube guides to get an understanding of the bot architecture. All major exchanges offer API access, which you can use for algorithmic trading.
A good start is the SoloLearn app, or the book 'Automation with Python' by Al Sweigart

Scientific approach for predicting BTC prices for next 180 days: 
"To make predictions about the Bitcoin price 180 days from
2017-06-07, again 104
fBm realisations were generated and inserted
into Eq. (1). The results are displayed in the right column
of Fig. 3. The probability of falling below the current price of
2575.9 USD is 11.4%, of exceeding the mean of 8410.34 USD
is 35.5%, of excedding the mode of 3634.13 USD is 77.1%,
and reaching a price higher than 10,000 USD has a chance of
27.5%. The median is at 6358.32 USD, i.e. this is the predicted
price to be attained in the beginning of 2018."

Recently started coding my own GDAX bot in Python. You're not gonna get anywhere if you don't have a basic understanding of how a programming language works. I suggest you pick a language from GDAX's list of supported API's first and then read into it before you start thinking of how you wanna build your own bot.

I tried trading stocks, but gave up on it due to high fees. Can confirm, it's bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:03:17
Exactly!

Current BTC market cap is about $80B. So if there are 16.5M BTC the cost per BTC is $80B/16.5M = $4848.5, which is pretty close to the current market price
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:54:51
On GDAX you can withdraw up to $25M by providing them with sufficient financial information on your business 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:50:11
It'll crack 100B, once it reaches $6k

Impressive that you took your time to study the material first before jumping in like all the other people who are now underwater! Really admire that self control. Don't disclose crypto holdings though.
