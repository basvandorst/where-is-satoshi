Still better than gold, and its marketcap is 9T. I think you're missing the value proposition. 
Also, most of the problems above should be solved by LN. More places accepting, Fast and inexpensive. Don't really get the complicated to use argument. Environmentally unfriendly reason is probably the biggest negative that I see. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:57:02
One thing which worked for me, but is very risky is buying alts during the dip (Only really works if you are looking to catch a fast dip). Then sell the alt back to BTC when the market recovers. This works since alts get hit harder during dips and also recover more.

Usually I would agree but many of those other things have a high entry point. One of the great things about crypto is that it can allow people who traditionally wouldn't have enough money to invest, to get involved. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:49:37
Yeah true, even though the % gain is not crazy compared to what we've seen throughout the year, when it becomes truly life changing money, ie deposit on a house etc, it's different. I guess one thing to remember is not to get too attached to how much your Bitcoin is worth during the peaks. If you believe in it long term, the month to month fluctuations don't matter too much
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:19:52

What happens when people start to value them at less than $1?, ie Tether stops being used as much for trading and there is not enough demand to keep them at $1. They can't burn Tether if I'm correct and there doesn't seem to be anything backing them. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:10:04
Just going through this article here's a few interesting points which are good to talk about. 
They say 'If that was the case and, given bitcoin's fixed maximum supply of 21 million, its price rose to match gold's market capitalisation, the Capital Economics analysts estimate that the cryptocurrency could rise from around $US10,000 to $US630,000.
However, that would assume that bitcoin was the sole accepted cryptocurrency, whereas its dominance is currently being challenged by more than a thousand rivals.'
The second part is misleading, because no (very few) alts are trying to be a competitor to gold and have a completely different use case. The comparison to gold seems completely out of place in this article since I would argue its the best pro-Bitcoin justification of a rise in price. They say Bitcoin could be worth $630,000 if it reached gold's value. Now I doubt this will happen but there has to be at least a 1/63 chance that it could happen and a reasonable chance we could see Bitcoin have atleast 5% of gold's value. 
The graph they bring up Chart 7 is quite triggering
The only comparable one really is the DotCom Bubble. The market was worth around 3T before it burst (6x what crypto is now), and is worth significantly more than it's peak today (with companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple doing well). The 'measly' 3x gains on the Dotcom bubble is also a bit misleading since as of 1997, the market was worth around 1T so they are comparing different stages. 
Holistically, the article provides no substance for why Bitcoin is a bubble apart from the fact that it has risen a lot, quickly. Comparing Bitcoin to other bubbles is easy to do, and is massively oversimplifying what's going on. You don't need any knowledge about crypto to compare it to bubbles in the past. It's the argument I'd have against Bitcoin if I too didn't know anything about it of real substance. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:43:01
One thing I've definitely learned in the last year apart from crypto is how many 'economists/finance professionals' are willing to comment on something they obviously know little to nothing about. It would be nice if some of these 'professionals' could at least do some research before spurting out trash. This article isn't even close to the worst I've come across
I know you are probably new to this and sort of see people like Andre in the same light you see conspiracy theorists who can't trust 'mainstream media'. However, when you actually look at some of the facts and begin to understand Bitcoin you can call a spade a spade. 
The thing is, I am very pro Bitcoin but could write a much better article concerning the issues that Bitcoin faces.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:29:17
This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin was created. I really think it would do extremely well in a stock market crash or any major financial crash, similar to precious metals. In fact I would argue that people would rather have crypto since you can send it around/move it easier

This. Imagine if we had that big run up when lightning and Segwit were in action and Coinbase were actually batching txs. The price would've gone stratospheric. It's good for BTC to remain still less mainstream before these upgrades are being developed. 
On the other hand this massive increase in use showed us the issues with BTC and fixes are being developed faster to cope with increased demand.

@_date: 2018-01-17 21:04:10
This dip has been the roughest in the last year though. I guess it's mainly due to how many new people have come in the last 2 months. A lot of people sell during their first dip. 
Good news is a lot of the weak hands are gone so we can begin another run. I think this is why we often see good runs after a 'crash' since the only people left are those who believe in the tech, are holding long term or bought the dip hard.

Yeah, couldn't have anything to do with more transactions being included in each block. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:03:20
The idea is if you load Bitcoin into a lightning channel, you can make instant, very low fee transactions to anyone else, with an open channel connected to the network. If it is scaled up, you should be able to pay for things/send Bitcoin around, to pretty much anyone.

They don't directly benefit from the high fees though. Imo they benefit far more by Bitcoin being more useable as more people will want to buy it through their platform
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:48:42
It's not too late. In fact it's a much better time to buy than it was a month ago. Do your research on it and don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Not a bad idea to diversify, IE put some in stocks, some in crypto, some in your term deposit, some in property (if you have the captial) and some in personal ventures.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:19:18
LN isn't supposed to be usable for the vast majority of people. It's still very much in early testing. In development the back-end is always worked on first. I would also argue that in general BTC is very easy to use. IE sending and receiving is a piece of cake. 
The thing with LN is that it's possible to have a lightning wallet. So you send your funds to a wallet and it's already in a channel. Shouldn't really be too difficult or unintuitive. Just tell people if they want to spend BTC, put it in a lightning wallet and if they want to store it, put it in a normal wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:46:55
If Coinbase implements Segwit + batching, we won't be seeing high fees anytime soon.

I don't know about you, but I'd be more pissed if I cashed out and it went way up than if I didn't and it went way down. I am assuming you got in early so you've done well to hold onto what you have. Remember you could've easily sold during the other crashes and look how that would've turned out. Wouldn't be a bad idea to take some gains but 40% all at once seems a lot. Maybe cash out like 5-10% a month over the next 6 months or something
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:25:52
It's a super strange time in the market. Tons of people are waiting to buy off the 100 day support around the 8500 mark but at the same time, people who were going to panic sell have already sold. Seems to me like we are either going to flatten out just above the 10k mark or bounce hard from the 100 day support level to 11k +

I think it's more likely to be a mining pool. If an exchange were to batch this many txs, it would take a relatively long time for 3000+ withdrawals to accumulate and hence be slow for the users.

I get where you're coming from but I think it's good news all things considered. It's better that it collapsed now rather than a year or two down the track where far more people were burnt. There was clear information out there that this was a scam so although I can't feel great for people losing money (especially given where it's going), people who put money in had lost it already due to their stupidity/ignorance.

This first point you raise is so true. So many places I see people complaining about no central authority, no one to reimburse if you lose, no one responsible for your losses etc. But this is literally why Bitcoin is Bitcoin

It is a real shame lots of people will have been burnt by this dip and it'll take a lot to get them back. On the other hand, it does put the crypto in much stronger hands so after this one, don't expect another big dip for a while.

What reason do you have that it's a speculative bubble other than the price is rising fast?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:55:03
I believe it's the same. Larger transactions generally have larger fees because people sending large amounts tend to care more about speed rather than cost. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:59:15
You can back it up with a 12-24 word 'seed'. Ie just write in down on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper and if you lose the device, you can load you wallet from a new one that you buy (using the seed).

Literally "11k is too much for the price of coin". Thanks for the analysis
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:34:43
Fluctuations in price aren't as big of a risk for businesses as you might think. Yes, the BTC for a product can go down 10% in day but it also has a relatively equal chance of gaining the same amount. Basically the fluctuations should all balance out over the long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:15:09
I believe Ledger and Trezor use the same back-up standards. The standard (BIP39) isn't exclusive to either wallets, so you can load your balance on any wallet which uses this same way of backing up (no issue of it not being around in 10 years). 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:29:05
I might be wrong on this since I'm like you, having done a little research but I think it's in the name 'Network'. Once more and more people have LN, you can send funds from your channel to anyone who is connected. Basically, if I have a channel open with someone, and they also have a channel to someone else, I can send directly to that someone else without opening a new channel. When more and more people get connected, you should be able to send to almost anyone. At least this is what I drew from reading on it (please correct me if I have this completely wrong). 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:58:16
This is some of the worst advice I've ever seen. If you are in student debt and struggling the last thing you should be doing is taking out more debt to invest in an extremely volatile investment which could easily -50% in a week. 
If you lose 50k at 25 you can make it up, but a lot of people who are 25 are not going to look at it this way. There are far too many people who are putting in more than they can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:46:14
There are a lot of people who are just in it for a quick buck. At the moment Bitcoin is completely useless for the average Joe's transactions. 
However, there is real potential. The average transaction is around 100k USD with 30-50 Billion transacted a day. In comparison Visa has around 25 Billion a day transacted. If LN is successful, you can use Bitcoin for micropayments too and it becomes far more useful for everyone else.  
Also, I don't think many people understand how important a decentralized currency is. You don't need to wear a tin-foil hat to know there are a lot of incompetent governments out there (Just look at Venezuela for e.g.) and in those countries you'd rather trust something out of their grasp. Gold/Silver has historically been good in places like these but it can easily be seized and its a lot harder to transact with. Even in 1st world countries, I believe Bitcoin is a good hedge against a recession.
I do think the recent gains have been very speculative and there are a lot of people involved who don't have a clue what they are buying. I can understand why you are concerned with a lot of what you are seeing in the space at the moment (I am a bit too).

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:28:54
It's because of 2 mains reasons: 
1. Most alts only have trading pairs for BTC so when BTC's value goes down, so does their USD valuation. 
2. When BTC goes down, the market follows since people lose confidence in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:25:55

There's a lot of value to be had in a secure, decentralized currency/store of value. To put this in perspective Gold has a marketcap of about 8T or so. Bitcoin is secure, much easier to transport and also much easier to access. If you're living in a country with an incompetent government, Bitcoin has a lot of use. You don't need to wear a tin-foil hat and be severely anti-government to see the value in that.  
Despite the large focus on price and the people, especially in the last month or so just looking for a quick buck, there are  developments occurring. Adoption of Segwit will increase the transactions in each block by approx 70% to start with. Also, Lightning Network, which relies on Segwit gives users the potential to make smaller transactions with little/no fees. 
I can understand why you would look at Bitcoin now and think it's some sort of overblown bubble. Alot of the people getting in are looking for a quick buck and aren't doing any research into what they're investing in (An obvious cardinal sin for any investment). However, it does have the potential to act like in did at the start of the year and earlier (Small fees and low transaction times). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:29:56
I completely agree. I did comment a few days ago that this correction would be brutal. So many new people from 10k through to 20k. That first dip isn't too much fun and If you didn't really know what you bought, I'd probably be selling too. There are going to be a lot of pros making a lot of money right now. Expect this thing to bounce hard. Inadvertently shaken BCH quite a bit too which might not be a bad thing in the long run
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:00:14
Just because he says it will crash doesn't mean it has to crash lower than the price we have now. Historically, in Bitcoin there has been an upward trend and 'crashes'. We have had 4 crashes this year if I remember correctly: One from 1300-900, one from 2900-1700, one from 4500-2900 and one from 7000-5000 (approx). 
There is bound to be another 'crash' coming up, could be from 19k - 10k, could be from 50k - 30k, no one knows. A lot of new investors sell during a large dip and there has been no shortage of new investors since that last dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:49:28
Currently the 1 month futures on CBOE are trading at 18.3k and the price is around 17k on GDAX. Does this mean someone could just lock a 7%, 1 month profit by doing what you're saying?

There are 7.5 Billion people in the world (top 1% is 75 million). Currently there are approx. 2.3 Million BTC addresses with &gt;0.1 BTC. Most people have BTC stored in lots of different addresses so I'd estimate around 1M people own &gt;0.1 BTC. If BTC took over, it'd also probably be safe to say that less than 75M people would own &gt;0.1 BTC. Fairly shoddy maths but I hope you get the point.

Idk about this logic. If in 1-2 years, many more people get involved and it reaches a ridiculous price, it's human nature to be greedy. It's harder than you think getting out at the right time.
FYI, I don't think Bitcoin is severely overvalued at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:30:46
I guess it's harder to use because you need to set a buy order (Set Price and Click Buy and wait until it's filled). On Coinbase you just click buy. Other than that it's the same. I think people use Coinbase because they haven't heard of Gdax and don't know about it.

I do agree it has the potential to do this, especially the part with shitty national currencies (Like what we are seeing with Venezuela  the past few years).

It takes time for people to change and as of now 99% of people haven't 'touched' crypto yet and most people have no clue what it actually is other than the 'digital money' tag that's given to it in  random news articles. 
Mind you, the ones who control the price (the selling side of it anyways) are already bought in and most have the same sort of vision for crypto. I hope you're right

If you sent the transaction yourself and it's still 'pending' then maybe you have some chance.

If you're buying small amounts just buy on an exchange. Once you've saved up enough, you can transfer it out of the exchange, for the (normally) 0.0005 BTC fee. Exchanges only charge a pretty small % fee (or no fees like Gdax) so it's good for small buying. No point moving 0.01 BTC or less if there's a 0.0005 fee even if it does mean leaving it on an exchange

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:25:49
If Bitcoin did get to that point you'd need less than 0.1 BTC to be in the top 1%
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:31:38
Means there are less transactions waiting for confirmation, ie the network is less clogged. This should lead to lower fees since there are less transactions competing to be added to the next block. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:53:49
I do agree with you in some sense because the price could easily crash 50% or so and wipe out a lot of gains. However, if you invested 1k in the share market and it went up 10%, you'd say you're $100 in the green. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:15:15
Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:53:55
I am with you. I do see Bitcoin &gt; Gold even at the moment. However, you must remember that Gold was the 'gold standard' of currency for thousands of years and there is a lot of trust in it, in the general public. Still, there are only several million people who own any Bitcoin and given how volatile the price is at the moment, I don't see too many businesses adopting it within the next year. I know a lot of the value is based on potential but I think it'll take more actual adoption and use to bring the price up to those levels, of which I think will take at least a couple of years. I'd be thrilled if it reached those levels in even 5 years.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:08:13
To be fair a higher proportion of Bitcoin than fiat is used for illegal activity. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:59:53
Then how come this dip made it go over 50% again. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:58:53
My only advice is don't put in more than you can afford to lose. There's only one thing for sure and that's volatility. It can't keep on going up forever. The last month has been nice in terms of steady increases but it will have a correction (maybe that correction will be from 50k-30k or 20k-10k). If you can't handle losing a lot of money, don't invest too much.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:56:12
You really just commented on the post  to say that your making lots of money because of your arbitrage bots. Then you bring up Bitconnect. Rip credibility. I'm honestly confused as to why some people think it's a sustainable model. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:41:37
The thing is, since Bitcoin now has a much larger marketcap, it's harder to 20x in a year than it was last year. 20x would put Bitcoin's market cap at 4T which IMO is overvalued even if LN is a massive success and we start seeing more adoption (ie more regular businesses accepting it). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:21:29
If you've made a shit load from it, it's not a terrible idea to cash out the 5-10% you initially invested. That way, worst case scenario is you lose nothing. But it's probably not a bad idea to hodl it all either :)) Would be a shame to sell most of it now, if BTC has similar gains next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:16
Do you know any good critical sources of Bitcoin? I've tried to get both sides but the 'Bitcoin is going to crash' uses a lot of misinformation and generally dont seem to.understand how it works. It just makes me more confident when the people who will short it don't seem to have a clue what bitcoin is. I'd genuinely be interested to find some good critical sources.

Following form your horse analogy, it's kind of like, just before the race you see lots of people betting on a certain horse. It doesn't change the actual probability of who wins the race (the horse winning the race is not affected by any bets), but it gives you more information before the race, that the horse people are betting on had a higher chance of winning than you intially thought (Assuming people are betting on the horse to win because of information you haven't considered). 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:30:32
The professional traders are the ones wanting to sell into rookies and buy into rookies too. I.e. sell during the last few weeks when the market was frothing, buy when the rookies are panicking and selling just because the price is going down.

You're doing is wrong. Buy high, Sell low. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:24:35

The vast majority of day traders lose money. Time in the market is more important than timing the market. If you include BCH, its up 72% since the fork as of now. Id say that's pretty good. A 15-20% drop isn't the end of the world. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:26:35
If you get other people involved they really need to understand Bitcoin and its risks. So many people get scared off by its volitility, and need to realise that it should be a long-term investment (at least a couple of years). 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:44:53
You're right that it would likely go up. Bitcoin is popular in countries with political instabilities because btc is decentralised from the government. Basically, my take is political instability makes decentralisation more attractive therefore pushing the demand up.   
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:40:55
I would disagree that Bitcoin has to be harder than good to buy/sell. Once it gains larger exposure it will become easier to trade. It's already not too difficult to get and it definitely is easier to get control over it. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:35:20
Well, nothing  significantly has changed with Bitcoin in the last 2 weeks so I guess you could just look at this as a discount for a long term hold. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:21
If you were thinking about buying and were waiting for a dip, guess what, you just got 10% off with no real bad news and the positive news of the blockstream satelitte. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:09:18
People don't talk about this much, but if there were major issues with Coinbase, it could move the price a lot
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:37:42
This would make Bitcoin explode. If banks/stocks/fiat started collapsing people would look for something decentralised. It was one of the main reasons why Bitcoin was created. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:21:28
However, I think using the current unit Bitcoin appears to be far more rare/valuable which is a big draw card for it. 'There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin' seems more attractive than 'There will only ever be 21 billion mBtc. 
But yeah, the fact people can't think it can be divided since they think 'coins' are not divisible is an issue for beginners. I've spoken with people who have the misconception that it is too expensive when getting in for as little as $50 is easy. 
An interesting debate as to which one is better for sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:41:58
This is when the reward for mining halves. Currently the reward is 12.5 Bitcoin for every block that is confirmed and this will reduce to 6.25. Each halving occurs after 210,000 blocks have been mined. We are only around 60,000 blocks into the cycle, so it won't happen for another couple of years probably (rough guess). 
The price won't double but it decreases the supply of Bitcoin significantly since a lot of mined Bitcoin is put on the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:30:06
But if the crypto had a similar market-cap to gold and you dumped 1M, the price would move much less. Also since volume is proportionally a lot higher for crypto you would probably move the price even less. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:02:12
Hoarding them because of potential. Has the potential of being a border-less, currency/store of value which can't be corrupted. Already has a lot of real use in less developed countries. Has issues with scaling at the moment but once this is hopefully solved/improved, it could go back to having extremely low fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:41:24
No reason why it can't be used as a 'currency'. The fees at the moment make it unusuable to buy small things however, unless you're an idiot, I think you can agree that BTC and some other Cryptos work better than fiat and hence have future value. I may seem naive but this technology is not too bad
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:16:46
It is 43% below its peak relative to Bitcoin though. It was 0.15 Bitcoin, if he bought mid June. It's down about 50% since then to 0.075 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:23:06
If you want to start buying, I think the best time is when it's 'crashing', ie when China started banning exchanges, the price when down to 3k, which was IMO an overreaction due to the amount of FUD that was spreading. The price may never be lower than it is today, buy I just think it's more +EV doing this. Or, I would recommend dedicating a portion of you're salary to buying Bitcoin each week to reduce risk. Good luck, hopefully this Bitcoin thing pans out well 
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:03:18
Most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was back then so how were they supposed to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:09:13

@_date: 2017-11-03 01:15:14
I still don't get how its not 'life changing', generally speaking. And yes if you had millions worth, you wouldn't be like most people. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:20:25
Not in 2010, unless you were really involved in the industry. I think a lot of people heard of it through 2013 when it hit $100 and then it's ATH at $1200. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:24:04
I would say no, it has the potential to be worth far more than it is now. However, it is mainly just potential at the moment. It's a risky investment, don't put in more than you are willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:10:32
I didn't know many 18 yr olds with much expendable money but a lot who waste what they do have. Imo a good idea to invest when you're young, because you have more time to make it back if it does go down.

Median household income is 60k in North America. If you invest 1M wisely, then you can make that amount each year, accounting for inflation. It wouldn't get you by in some of the more expensive areas I'm guessing though.

Serious question. What did you think the difference between the two was?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:12:20
The market is hard to predict. It could go down but the price may never be lower, especially if we see the same kind of run up we had towards the end of last year. If you want to get in, I'd advice using a portion of your salary/savings to buy weekly, to avoid getting caught out by swings in the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:11:54
In the context of the burger he's right. Advances in Burger Farming and more competition developing over time should have reduced price for the consumer.

That's just ignorant, man. It may not be life changing if you already have millions of dollars but that's more money than the vast majority of people will earn in their lives. Also, it would be possible to live off 1 Million for the rest of your life, with a family. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:19:03
I get what you're saying but my original point was its a little ignorant to say that for most people it isn't life changing money, when for most people it clearly is. Only 5% of people in the US have &lt;1M worth of wealth and world-wide its &lt;1%

This is just as bad as the people telling everyone we would be seeing $800 in a week. Purely speculation without substance. Really there are two options, it goes up or it goes down.

This looks like the one. ETH bounced 20% in under 5 mins. 
Edit: Ik this is a Bitcoin forum but ETH was the currency to start the bounce since it fell the hardest in the past 12h or so, and there is good volume. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:56:01
It's still undoubtedly the most decentralised and secure crypto out there. I think people underestimate this. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:28:20
Most people in this sub are here because they believe in the tech and want to realise long term gains. Selling is never a good idea if you believe that it could be worth lots more in the future.
Also, timing the market isn't as easy as it sounds. It's easy to say that selling yesterday was a smart idea because the price has gone down now. The vast majority of people who try to play the market lose. Time in the market is more important than timing the market for most. 
The only time I'd recommend timing the market is buying into this China stuff and other random FUD which it always seems to bounce back from. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:44:57
I guess in this case, dollar costing isn't as important. However, if he wants to, it isn't a bad idea especially given he is trying to time the market.

Just invest say 200 a week for the next 10 weeks. This way you won't get caught out by swings in the market as much. Over the next few weeks should be good since I think Coinbase is adopting Segwit this month which should be beneficial

Not Facebook banning crypto ads. They're mainly for ICOs and random shitcoins. It's not obvious at all what's causing the price drop but the point is that people throwing out these 'reasons' for why Bitcoin is dropping are clueless.

It's very easy to make yourself seem like a genius when looking in hindsight.

Wading through all the FUD on here today gives me confidence tbh. People screaming 'sell' without any substance to what they are saying is everywhere. We saw the same kind of irrational behavior in the other direction, near the peak with people 'screaming' that Bitcoin was going to 50k etc (with no substance behind the statements). We have seen how that turned out. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:35:43

I don't really think this is a good measure of adoption at all. There are currently around 4 Million addresses with at least 10 mBC in them. Given many people have multiple addresses with Bitcoin in them, the number of Bitcoin users is probably closer to the 1-2 Million mark, with an average of around 10-20 per person.

@_date: 2017-09-03 08:20:13
Thing is the average number of Bitcoin for people who have &gt;1 bitcoin is probably relatively high due to some people who have ALOT ie 50k +. My guess is only around 1 Million people will have at least 1 Bitcoin. 
According to this thread: 
only 350k people have at least 1 Bitcoin (As of mid 2014) and according to this:  
there are around 610k addresses with over 1 Bitcoin although this doesnt give a great estimate due to people having Bitcoin on exchanges etc and also most people will have multiple addresses. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:24:30
LOL. 'The ride is over, it's dying now'. Everyone should take their advice from a guy who bought 1k of Bitcoin and sold it for the same price
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:50:31
Because it is decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:14
It went form 3k down to 1.5k in about a week mainly due to uncertainty regarding the upcoming fork and there was a lot of FUD (Bitcoin is dead kind of talk) flying around on the forums about how it was going back to 200 etc. What I am saying is, there is no guarantee that it's going any lower than it is now. Your 'strategy' hardly works if Bitcoin bottoms out around 8k and is sitting back at 12k in a few weeks. No one really knows what is going to happen in this market. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:33:31
We'll never truly get to 21 Million Bitcoin. There are a lot which are in a state of being 'lost' like this. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:29:35
There are many new people getting into Bitcoin who aren't weak hands and who do not panic sell. This is the first drop since we passed the 3k mark with a lot of new people getting into it. It does make Bitcoin's price more stable going into the future that all the weak hands sold. 
That's the way Bitcoin will grow. With people who understand the tech and don't panic sell rather than the get-rich-quick investors. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:25:36
This is a pretty horrible argument. If you were to buy a $30 item, it would take around 20 mins to get confirmed. Even with immense volatility you are paying between $29-31 which isn't really a massive turn off
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:46:38
The guy in the Blue shirt Doug Polk is pretty big in the poker scene (Was considered one of the best heads up NL Holdem players in the world) and runs a Youtube with 140k subs.

They know a thing or two about EV, and I doubt they'd be invested if the didn't see the same potential that we do. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:31:59
There is always a chance that it will not get confirmed for ages (very unlikely). It depends how much you care about fees. Anything above 5 sat/b should clear within the next 24h.

Yeah just turned back from looking at my phone and was like 'why is it over 8k?' 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:33:47
The problem with the selling now to buy lower is there are probably millions sitting on the sidelines now from people who sold from 12-19k and are waiting for the bottom. When this bottom is found, we could see a large short-term surge. Selling now, could put you at risk of having to buy back much higher.

I'm long term too but I don't think the last couple of months have been healthy for the long term tbh. I still have a positive outlook but the run up before Segwit and LN exposed masses to what seemed to be a half baked product that cost $20 to send around. Also, the 50-60% drop has burned many newcomers who won't want to get their feet wet later down the line. It would've been nice to see a more healthy correction down to say 12k and then steady for a few months. We'll see what happens from here

@_date: 2017-09-18 14:50:21
I think a lot of the price increases we've seen over the last year is related to the halving last year. Went from 3600 to 1800 coins mined per day meaning 1800 less a day and 657000 less over the last year. It's much easier for a price to move with a lower inflation especially given miners do account for quite a bit of the sell volume since many convert it back to Fiat to cover the Fiat costs of mining.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:20:02

Anyone who's invested in Bitcoin at all would have to consider themselves lucky. You'd give this kid props for picking out a good investment but you have to be lucky to have a 500x return.

He's right though. When you're younger you have a bigger license to take risks. If you lose it all, you can easily make it back. If you were to lose it all, in your late 50s then you're pretty much fucked for retirement

I am appalled that you would sell the kids before the kidney

Let's all listen to the guy who invested in Bitconnect

I'm sure it still happens though.

How is ETH more decentralized btw?

Just buy some incrementally over the next 12-20 months would be my advise if you want to get involved
I would say it isn't a 'bad' time to buy. We are not in a completely over-hyped phase like we were at the start of the year where everything went up without infrastructure to support the growth.
Positives are that a Bitcoin ETF may be on the horizon which would have positive effects. Also in 22 months there's the next halving which effectively cuts in half BTC inflation (From about 2.6% to 1.3%). Given the action after the last halving, we could see prices rise towards the end of next year due to that.
Main negative is that it could be quite a quiet year from here on. BTC's current value is based off potential. If we don't see that potential being realised, the value will likely drop. I'd be suprised if BTC isn't higher in 2 years than it is now but wouldn't be at all suprised if we are sitting lower in 12 months time.

Try to read around a bit, learn a bit more about the technology and what it is trying to accomplish. This way you should understand where the value is and should stop you from making irrational decisions down the line. If you are  going to buy, try GDAX, LocalBitcoins, Gemini etc.

Have you heard of LN or decentralization?

I think the large traders tend to buy through their own walls if they aren't intending to sell. It gives a much greater impression of the market being bullish

There's nothing saying that you were 'wrong'. Were people 'wrong' to buy BTC at $700 back in 2013? Just be honest and say that it's been a rough week but the long term outlook is still positive.

Intriguing statements
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:11:02
Yeah and the article says that he first bought $250,000 at $6.

Hard to get very poor if you don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Imo it's worth it to take the risk if you abide by this

We are definitely not at the moon. Many people think it could rise to 100k + over the next few years. Thing is, most likely we won't reach anywhere near this. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. It can be a very stressful investment if you aren't good with handling losing money. 
As for the price. Time in the market is more important than timing the market. If you are wanting to get in now try buying like 10% of your full investment every week to avoid the variance of price swings on your initial investment.

There are a lot of reasons why I don't think we'll see anywhere near the same situation as 2013. First of all is the most obvious, after seeing the bounce from the last bear market many more people will be looking to catch the bottom. Secondly, BTC has become a lot more proven than it was back then, we have seen it taken a lot more seriously, with Futures etc. Thirdly, there are scaling solutions being implemented which should reduce congestion if we see another run up. Lastly, we have seen a lot more real use in blockchain, and the tech behind BTC being used in business. Although not directly tied to BTC, more use of blockchain tech is good, since BTC is still the most decentralised and secure coin.

LOL 'btc is never coming back'. It's pretty funny seeing all this shit on the sub now who apparently don't have a memory. People have been saying this shit for ages.

People don't work their whole lives for USD. They work to support themselves and their families.
I agree that it's in everyone's interest to have better money but to say people 'slave' away for USD is over the top
