Do you guys understand how much money is needed to bring all network Hash +10 % ?
we are talking in the 10's of millions invested $$$ pouring into mining every 13-15days. 
i have a feeling that when halving get near, some of the $$$ or all will be used buy up all undervalue BTC (sub$600). 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:52:10
we are under valued right now. and will be way undervalue after the halving at this prices
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:32:07
Agreed, you cant keep on pumping money into random bitcoin start up. Sooner or later you gonna have to buy Bitcoin its self.

we need more media attention to get out the awareness. apparently there are still alot of people who dont know what a BItcoin is
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:34:54
my point is that it will cost much more than that $1,500. i want to underestimate and be correct ,than overestimate and be completely wrong and off. 
the bottom line is that everything should cost 10's of millions.

it was from coinbase, i actually got a chance to buy it at $39 and 40 but didnt, which i regret big time.

guys just wait for the 3rd or 4th halving, now that would be really interesting 
@_date: 2015-12-04 06:10:11
i have been averaging around 1%-1.56% a month. depending on the month. which is a sweet deal. this is not going to last forever because when more and more people knows about Bitcoins and use Bitfinex. there would also be more people offering the Lending on Cash, which would drive the interest rate down. slowly. 
i remember 2years ago it was around 17-21% per year. 
obivously there are more people now than in 2013ish.

in 2013, got my first BTC for $44 after Crash from $256.
now Ending 2015, Entering 2016 with many Failed crash attemp bringing it sub $100. i am very bullish about this halving looking forward.
having keep on buy Btc on crash ever since then

let do some math, how much would it cost to put up 1 PetaHash?
lets just you buy a bunch of S7 miners, each one output around 4.7TeraHash and cost $1,500(being conservative)
1)from Dec18-Dec31, hashrate climb from 668P.hash &gt; 743P.hash
2)that is 75P.hash difference or increase. 
3)1Petahash=1000Terahash, 212ish Antminer = 1Petahash. 
4)so your gonna need 15,957 S7 antminers for the 75P.hash Gain
5) which should cost $23,935,500 USD ish. 
6) even if they make there own mining chips or get massive discount
 on Bulk Order, everything should cost more than 10 million USD. 
7) dont forget about Labor to setup, cable, powercords, shipping cost, etc. 
last note, 
the more the difficulty increases the more harder it would be to keep maintaining this 10% growth in hashrate. because it would require more and more $$$ to maintain the same percentage growth.

there are already lots of people doing it that is why there are millions USD already available for margin loans. however there will be millions more in the future, i just know it.

when BTC liquidity become so strong, 
with something like over 500 Billion Market Cap, there is no need to have a bank account anymore.  
because you can do everything without it.

Hahaha me too, i also Leveraged Long on BTCe MT4, i just did 1.65X margin. just to be abit safer, than 2x or 3x. 
good luck

i can almost guarantee you that senting many smaller amounts in many different address is better than senting 1 large amount into 1 address. 
for every company there is a tracking policy, if the amount is too big or big enough, they will track you. if a transaction is small enough, they will not waste time. 
i would normally sent 0.25 BTC (4x) into 4 different address for the same wallet, instead of senting 1.0 BTC into 1 address. it make it harder/More work required to track. also at different time stamp.

Selling Gold for USD sucks, they want your ID and everything

dude, back in the 2013 Crash of reaching ATH at $256ish. i bite my teeth and buy a Load of BTC for $52-64. at that time i thought it was really expensive until it reach $1000 ATH, and holding steady $250 for a while. before i can confirm that i got a good deal.
