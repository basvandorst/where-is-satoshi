Well, the long answer is: no.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:29:08
It's been about a week, what is a realistic expectation with that low of a fee, and is there a way to see where it is in the mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:33:12
Daaaaammmmn I'm considering expediting now that its been over a week
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:38:36
I second this, I had to learn this lesson twice...

You don't have a copy of the memo warning you about the 5th of January 2021?  
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:47:36
This was just a witch pursuit thing.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:47:11
On your genitalia is a lot better
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:22:13
I'm in the same boat, sent on the 7th with a low fee and it's still pending.  If mine gets kicked back to my wallet or finally processed I'll let you know
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:20:35
Sent from my Trezor, will be three days by 1900 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:57:37
Yeah, mine will have been processing for three days at 1900.  [Hash](

Feels like last year
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:33:58
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:06:29
What can I do at my level to help out and be a part of the solution?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:50:13
I did the same, I will let you know when mine processes.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:25:52
Hours?  I say minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:36:27
He called the shit, poop!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:38:29
Is there a way to expedite the return to my wallet, and do you know of a way to track its movement in the mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:01:11
Biggest plot twist: He's friends with King Missile and now has a detachable penis
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:33
Do I need to go back on my Trezor and do anything to cancel it or will it be kicked out of the mempool?  Still learning.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:16
Netflix has a decent documentary: "Banking on Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:21:56
That's good to know, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:01:07
Sad face 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:18:09
You want my S2X for your bitcoin?  Deal!
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:18:08
I think bitcoin has heard you!  At least on GDAX, price is dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:37:11
I'm at day four, and it's been suggested it might take a whole week for my transaction.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:26:31
Ha!  Irony can be so cruel 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:49:40
If you buy $100 worth today, I will give you $100 for it next month for sure. Or even next year, just let me know
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:00:59
I noticed that a week ago.  Motherfuckers!

If he eats his dick, we all lose.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:32:24
And it will be for the price you bought it at.

Sick PS skills
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:39:54
I'll tell you after you give me your Agency name 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:31:50
Well, I guess I'm selling everything I own and buying more!  What's one year as a bum?
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:37:51
1.  Buy a hardware wallet.
2. Get a new computer (or completely wipe an old one) so that it hasn't been introduced to any malware.
3. Research how to transfer your BTC in an offline transfer.4. HODL, or hire a couple of lawyers and a financial advisor!
Edit: transfer not transaction sorry
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:09:47
Mmmmm beat me to it.
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:27:36
I know right!  I am still hoping he'll come back and post a verifiably success story.  Sucks he had brain cancer and was homeless though.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:59:14
What is this future telling machine that you possess?
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:27:23
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:45:59
I would also consider establishing a trust for your son and place at least half into that trust for him.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:07:09
I would wait to plug those in!  Get smart on all the procedures and come up with a plan first, and I would consult a trusted friend if you are feeling overwhelmed.  It was stated earlier, there is no rush, and this would be a very good case to get everything right before you try to transfer anything.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:43:51
You can wait for it to dip a little, but it might not dip lower than what the current price is.  So now is a good time.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:45:46
$499,999.99 and some Go Pros and you have a deal.

Two finance commenters mentioned this on RT last night, and they were hesitant to mention the "bitcoin" word.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:52:34
I can't claim this as my original, stolen from google search
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:43:32
Thanks Noob Noob!
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:37:34
Boring, but I'll still upvote you.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:33:30
Edit: I will do my homework before posting old sources...
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:05:48
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:33:38
I tried that and all they talk about is Trump, definitely not in tune with my specific needs.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:31:41
Yeah mine went from 3-4 days earlier this month to 8 days total (5 working) on my last transaction.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:47:29
Oops, still learning.  Don't make me eat my own dick please...
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:43:35
Waaa waaa waaaaaaaa, better luck next time I Guess
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:06:07
This would be sweet
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:04:58
Look up paper wallets.  And MtGox.  If you don't possess your private keys, then you are at their mercy, and they will always pick their interests over yours.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:23:08
This is sound advice
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:09:10
Should I be suspicious?  Or is this normal...
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:39:59
Hahahahahahahaha, what a pathetic loser! (use Jim Carrey voice for dramatic effect)
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:55:30
Hey, sometimes they get things right.  The media has been sucking a lot in the last few years
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:10:37
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:28:16
More sound advice.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:52:01
I don't even know why I didn't think that, way more plausible 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:02:57
I'll take two Trevor's, only if they work hard and don't complain.  Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:37:46
Good thing you didn't.  It's probably time to get some sleep.  And start thinking about beginning a new life, by getting new emails and phone numbers and changing your name etc.!!!
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:08:56
This is about the only time I would welcome a false summit.
