I think coinbase is affected aswell... 
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:09:23
Has anybody thought how we could use the timelock functionality to create automatic monthly transfers from cold storage? All the transaction would be pre-created and available to the hot wallet. This would allow for an automated multi tier system. In case of a lost hot wallet, the cold wallet would have to transfer all coins to invalidate the timelocked, but otherwise valid transactions. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:50:51
I don't know if this can be explained by empty hot wallets or something, but I just had a transaction stuck for 50 min. After comparing all the inputs on Coinbase address&amp;transaction with blockchain's infos on those addresses, I found that one of the inputs had 0.003 BTC on coinbase, but had 0 on blockchain. I "fixed" the transaction by sending the missing amount + fee to one of the inputs which made the transaction succeed.

Those contactless payment terminals are all we need. So thx for the info! 
@_date: 2015-05-14 13:52:41
I need to research czech in terms of nfc penetration. What do you think, does it make sense?

Hi Reddit! OP &amp; BlockOps creator here. I want to share with you how BlockOps came to live: A few weeks back my co-founders and me at OneBit made it a sport to create dockerized hack challenges and send them to each other. This habit of challenging each other to break &amp; hack stuff has really picked up in our startup and with BlockOps we decided to share those challenges with the community.
Aside from the signup challenge, we currently have 3 bitcoin related challenges live. Let us know if you like this concept. We still got a big backlog of dockerized hack challenges that we just need to cleanup and make scalable to allow you guys to break them. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:16:31
hahaha I used to live in Osaka a few years back. Thanks for the offer to connect us with JR! For now we want to get everything working with the international nfc solutions first before we focus on local ones. But I am also extremely excited to get the train cards to work ;)
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:23:40
1) Correct
2) So far it works on the 2 biggest credit-card terminals. But we are looking to add local nfc solutions in the future
3) This is a goal for the future to make the app go main stream. The added bonus will be that you can also pay anywhere overseas and won't be hit by crazy FX fees. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:10:13
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:08:38
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:26:03
Thanks for your feedback! We already have a smart algorithm for the confirmations. Small amounts will be available at 0-conf. I hate waiting ;)
I am not sure what you mean by loyalty cards. 
Topup from paperwallets and trezor are interesting and nice to have. I'll keep that in mind
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:34:10
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:22:28
We'd love to have you as a tester! We'll announce on our mailing list soon how to become an alpha tester. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:40:48
A1: Either, both works.
A2: If you don't have enough funds you can't pay. The app will catch most of this, but if you manage to get the transaction started then the terminal will display: transaction declined
A3: You can only pay at nfc terminals with OneBit. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:51:54
I am not certain that it will work offline without requiring a certain sim card or putting a nfc sticker on your phone
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:00:40
I haven't seen anyone accept cards for currency exchange. But maybe
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:46:59
We are already considering this, because it will also apply to iphone users. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:28:42
not that fast. I would love to add japanese nfc systems, but we don't have it working yet. Our priority is the international payment systems that work already globally first and then add local solutions like suica, minapita and icoca.
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:08:28
OneBit a hosted bitcoin wallet. You will need to deposit bitcoin before you can make payments. But then you will be able to do instant payments.
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:42:33
The creditcard usage and especially the contactless terminals are still rare in Japan. We are much more interested to get OneBit to work with Icoca and Minapita terminals. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:34:04
C&amp;D only apply to unlawful situations. We would have to be break a contract or the law. And so far bitcoin is perfectly legal in most countries and we obviously won't be available in countries where it is illegal to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:46:27
Thanks! Well, we need to have control over the funds to be able to give you the guarantee to pay instantly, but you obviously don't need to deposit more money than you intend to use. And our deposits are quick (0-1 confirmations for small amounts). I understand the implications of becoming a target for hackers. Aside from building out proper multi sig hot and multi level cold storage, we are also talking to an insurance company to get your funds insured.
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:46:05
You are right. Mastercard and Visa operate as a franchise business with thousands of issuing partner banks. So far they have not issued any guidance on how to deal with companies like ours. Therefore it is up to the issuing bank to decide if they want to do business with us. I can't really say more than that.
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:05:15
Yes you will need to be online to complete a transaction. And thanks for the offer to test it! We need just a bit more time before we can let outside testers onto it. If you are interested how the payments work, look up HCE. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:02:18
Thanks! We are working hard to make it happen! And thanks for the offer to help with legal advice! I'm sure I'll get back to you on that :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:48:47
For the merchant it's just a creditcard payment. He doesn't need to know anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:17:53
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:27:14
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:12:35
We have done successful transactions in Europe and Asia. But I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work everywhere else.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:38:05
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:07:13
You are correct. To be able to allow instant payments, we will need to control the bitcoin in your wallet. Just keep a small amount in there for your everyday purchases and have the bulk of your savings somewhere else ;) 
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:19:33
We integrate with local bitcoin exchanges and just sell your bitcoin on the fly. Similar to how BitPay does it.
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:36:07
Thanks for the link! I am not sure if we will go that way, but I'll keep it in mind :)
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:48:37
We want you you to forget about the idea of having a card tied to a currency. It's just a payment app that tries to give you the best rate, wherever you go ;)
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:09:27
Right now it's only nfc payments, but we are looking into it.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:20:40
A1: We will take part in the interchange fees that the merchant pays his acquiring bank. Those interchange fees are the reason there are so many miles and points and cashback cards.
A2: We will do KYC/AML on our users. That said, I don't think we are the best solution for money laundering, as you can "only" buy things with us. You can not get cash out. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:31:40
I am. For every jurisdiction separately. For now I can tell you that Singapore is fine. Btw, for them we are no different then all the other bitcoin denominated cards(Xapo, bitx,...) that exist already
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:16:26
To be clear: We don't have a official partnership with Visa or Mastercard. But we also don't need one. The risk would be that they force all of their thousands of issuing banks to stop doing business with bitcoin companies. The issuing banks are quite independent, so I don't see this happen. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:08:26
We are not based in the US and due to the complexity of the US legal system, we will rollout in the US only after Europe.

Hey fellow Bitcoiners!
A quick update from us: We are alive and OneBit works! We are now in Alpha and have our first handful alpha users doing test transactions around the globe.
And yes: No Fees! You will be able to pay world wide, at market rates at any shop that accepts credit cards via NFC!
But before we launch OneBit we want to make sure that our security is top notch. And for that we are talking with a bunch of highly motivated investors to bring bitcoin main stream. 
So how can you help to speed things up? Create some buzz and sign up to get notified when we launch! ;)
Edit: It's getting late over here. Thanks everyone for the great questions! We'll be back tomorrow. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:06:32
There are KYC tiers on the lower end that do not require IDs or proof of residence. That is the reason you can buy prepaid debit cards over the counter in some countries. Depending where you live, you might be able to use OneBit anonymously for smaller transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:04:17
Our profit comes from MasterCard in the form of kickback for each transaction. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 11:58:44

OneBit needs your help! We have build a prototype that lets you spend your bitcoin at any Mastercard Paypass terminal during a Mastercard Hackathon and got very positive feedback from Mastercard. While Mastercard is helping us get a partnership with a card issuer, we are moving forward to secure funding, because we don't want to launch a half-assed bitcoin wallet that gets us in trouble for violating KYC laws. And this is where YOU come in! We got invited to the selection days of the startup bootcamp fintech accelearator in Singapore and we need your help to prove that there is interest for OneBit!
**Show us that you want OneBit by adding your email and we will make it happen!**
Edit: I'm going to bed as I have to catch a plane in a few hours. I'll answer the rest of your questions tomorrow
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:44:52
Fair enough. Time will tell - I guess :D
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:54:53
Imagine a simple bitcoin wallet. When you want to pay in a restaurant, you just take your phone and tap it on the NFC enabled payment terminal (very common in Europe and Singapore). The magic that happens underneath is done by BitPay who converts your bitcoin and MasterCard, who sends the money to the restaurant
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:06:33
That's correct. OneBit was build at a MasterCard hackathon and no official partnership exists at the moment. While an official MasterCard endorsement would be great, all we need is a card issuer.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:49:40
In the US, only 15% of the payment terminals have NFC. Europe is much more interesting in that regard. So yes, UK will be one of the main target countries :)
Thanks for the offer for beta testing! Let me get back to you!
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:28:20
1. Mastercard will be a partner 
2. They are directly involved, as we are using their APIs and SDKs. The card issuing will be done by a third partner. 
3. Our goal is to get into the startup bootcamp accelerator program which will also give us access to DBS bank and their network and launch OneBit at the end of their 3 month program on July 28th.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:18:37
Thanks for the heads-up! 
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:44:16
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:46:23
Right now we use CoinKite's APIs for the bitcoin transactions and Storage. Initially OneBit will therefore be a hosted wallet due to simplicity. But this might still change until we launch depending on user feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:52:07
Shoot me a message after we finish raising this round and let's see ;)
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:25:40
Got nothing to hide: just google my nickname and you will find my real identity ;)
I am a serial entrepreneur and OneBit will be my 3rd company. My background is AI, IT-security and cryptography. I have been fascinated by Bitcoin for the last 3 years, but never quite found the right idea to form a company around until now. 
My co-founders have a background in UX&amp;UI design and security and together we have a long history of building products. We managed to get Mastercard and DBS bank interested in OneBit and with their help, I am confident that we can build OneBit without getting burned like Charlie Shrem did. And yes, legal is the main reason we can't just ship it...
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:42:01
That's correct. OneBit is a Bitcoin Wallet that lets you pay at the NFC terminal directly. No card needed.
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:03:22
Thanks for your support! Our initial goal is to release OneBit with Mastercard PayPass support. But eventually we want to integrate it with every payment system out there until eventually Bitcoin is accepted everywhere ;)
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:43:40
Haha Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:50:37
I had the idea of OneBit when I saw the presentation of Samsung Pay and Loop Pay. And that's the ultimate end goal: to integrate with LoopPay (new Samung Devices) which will allow you to pay at **any** credit-card terminal directly with Bitcoin. 
But without any published APIs and the first LoopPay activated phone launching next week; I can't promise that just yet.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:03:46
Thanks! We will follow up with more concrete info in the next 2-3 weeks. Our launch goal is July 28th.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:02:10
NFC payment terminals seem to be quite rare in the US (~15% of the terminals). But my next goal is to integrate with Samsung Pay's LoopPay technology if possible and then that won't be an issue.
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:43:42
BitPay was one of the main sponsors of AngelHack (who is the organizer of the Mastercard hackathons). So yes, we are in contact with BitPay.
And in regards to fees: BitPay removed the 1% fees about one year ago. If you have a web shop, I can highly recommend them for accepting Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:59:28
Thanks for the motivating words! :)
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:00:42
Mastercard charges the merchant. That's where there revenue comes from. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:04:47
Yes ;)
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:59:36
Either that or Samsung Pay will come along with their Loop Pay technology and eat Apple's breakfast haha. I just hope that Samsung will open up their API's for us ;)
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:09:38
We don't charge fees to the end-user and yes we want to launch Sweden aswell!
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:08:04
If Bitcoin would be big enough, then that would make sense for them. Right now Bitcoin is just one market out of many for them and we will be just one partner out of many. But a $1 billion commerce market is something. So yes, Mastercard is excited to be part of that ;) 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:53:05
I totally understand that. We will do our best to make it as seamless as possible. Luckily we don't have re reinvent the wheel here. Check out Jumio's NetVerify. It works like a charm on Mobile devices.
And thanks for the motivating words! :)
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:50:29
You basically answered 1 yourself. For number 2: We have several introductions and are pitching to them now. And number 3 is not a main focus, but is definitely possible todo.
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:20:19
We will be be Android first due to market size and the possibility to access NFC. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:07:09
We plan to launch on July 28th and Europe is very important for us as there is already a high concentration of NFC enabled payment terminals.
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:22:04
I am not asking for any money. But thanks for the feedback! We will put up a team page as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:12:02
I don't think Mastercard would be up for that, as they have to do their own money laundry checks on every partner. But I can highly recommend other bitcoin wallets to talk to "the enemy". Mastercard is quite open for Bitcoin over here in Singapore.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:35:25
The most exciting part about bitcoin for me, is that it can give bank accounts to people that couldn't otherwise. And yes, if there is any (legal) way I can help those people spend and use their money freely, then I will do that. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:57:48
You are correct. In regards to number 1: it's up to the merchant to accept Bitcoin directly and save on the credit card fees. OneBit will of course allow you to pay directly with Bitcoin aswell
@_date: 2015-10-06 04:06:09
Thanks! We'll put something up on the website soon! And keep me updated on name ideas :)
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:38:06
Thanks! Let me bounce those of my team!
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:33:37
Sorry for the lack of communication guys! We are making good progress towards a launch and have grown our vision to also help non Bitcoin people save money - paying globally, which got us to start looking for a better name. Our plan was to re-brand to OnePay, but encountered some trademark issues. If you have good suggestions for a name before we launch, please let me know :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:58:51
Nice idea! Checkout what we did with studypact. It uses a very similar model for study motivation.
