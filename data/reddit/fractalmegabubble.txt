Cool idea, but your implementation is not decentralized. You apparently have the power to remove content.

Thanks a lot. Not only was your response straight to the point, that link was incredibly insightful and inspirational. Hal was the man.

Awesome word.
I take it that you are saying that the image shows bitcoins skeuomorphed as a traditional currency. Honestly, I've never thought of that before, and it makes me feel like these images are a translation as opposed to a misunderstanding. Thanks for the perspective!

That's terrible dude. Having lost a good amount at gox and also neobee I understand how it feels. 
Thing is, 4 still may be worth a small fortune way down the road. 
Don't give up the dream yet, save them and try to forget about it for awhile.

The image from the pastebin has an invalid street address. There is a person that fits the name and has had a similar address history, but they are 10 years older than Satoshi. This seems to be a fake.

Enlighten us, please?

Have you tried getting someones help? I believe there are somewhat reputable companies that will do it for a fee if you know some of the password. Hell, I'd like to try :)

do i have to?

The way the math works out is that it is much more efficient (can't remember specifics) to mine for Bitcoin with your cycles than to try to run across random keys being used. 
Also: Why are you thinking about using your company machines for personal profit? I work in an extremely large data processing center and I find it appalling that you would think that's ok. Not only would you be stealing other people's coin, but you'd be stealing from your company. Just sayin'

Fun read

Many would say that just the opposite has been happening...
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:14:02
Has it been discussed what Hal did with his coins?

Equipment costs are sunk costs. A miners current concern is always going to be to focus on the energy bill... It's all about $/H. Astute miners will only run machines that provide positive value at the current exchange rate. If $/H turns negative you turn that machine off. The reason the hash rate is going up is either because people don't care that they're losing money (they are playing the futures game), or that they are still making money at the current $/H. Sound reasonable?

Now that's what I call a killer app!
(I really hope you're joking, are you?)
