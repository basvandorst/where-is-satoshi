 If you are willing to pay out a decent amount of money in exchange for the recovery of your funds, I believe there are few websites where you can post a bounty reward with the hope that an expert in blockchain will help you with the recovery. 
You can set a percentage of your recovered funds for the bounty reward and since the bounty will be paid out on the return of your funds it is a low risk attempt.

If you are a victim of a Bitcoin scam, the chance of recovering your funds are pretty much nonexistent and this is due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, the likelihood of recovering your funds is fairly low.
However, all hope is not lost. Depending on your situation and your level of persistence, there may be a few ways to recover your lost funds.
 If this scam has resulted in direct charges from on your debit or credit card or transfers from your bank account you should call your bank immediately and report it as an unauthorized transaction. the earlier you report, the better your chances and the charge may be reversed.

 You should follow the transactions of the wallet address you accidentally sent funds into and if you notice any attempt to transfer funds to crypto exchanges to sell for fiat currency, report to the relevant exchanges immediately.
