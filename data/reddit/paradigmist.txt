Eh, I'd argue that the pasture-to-slaughterhouse beef industry that's constantly cycling through more and more cattle is responsible for a greater proportion of methane production due to livestock.
According to the AHDB, there are about [43.7 million cows in India]( but the proportion of cattle raised to slaughter is practically none.  By comparison, the USDA estimates [9.3 million dairy cows and 30.5 million beef cows]( in the US, for a total of 39.8 million.
This is a total of 0.123 cattle per capita for the US, and only 0.0338 cattle per capita for India.  That's almost four times as many cows per American.

I have listened to all sorts of people speculate on bitcoin.  I have come to the personal conclusion that it won't work.  I'm not claiming that my opinion is fact, it's what I think will happen.  Of course, because this opinion differs from yours, I simply haven't thought it out enough, because clearly anyone as enlightened as you would come to the irrevocable conclusion that bitcoin will work.
FYI: I learned about bitcoin in ~2010; I mined back when you could use a CPU.  I certainly wasn't interested in it because I thought it would be worth billions of dollars.

That has nothing to do with my argument or yours.  All that I'm saying is that someone can be informed about Bitcoin and believe it will not succeed to the extent that some diehards claim.  It's conceited of you to suggest that I can't believe that Bitcoin "won't work".  On some level, it implies that the burden of proof is on me to prove that Bitcoin is destined to mediocrity, as if something so subjective and arbitrary as an opinion is subject to empirical evidence.  The Bitcoin market -- like any market -- cannot be perfectly modeled, predicted, or speculated on.  That does not mean that one cannot form an opinion on it.

Since I'm worried you have ADHD, I'll put my TL;DR up first:
TL;DR: You're still wrong, your arguments are pathetic, your actions are more troll-like than mine.
Maybe it's the fact that I've been working on statistical mechanics problems for the past 16 hours, but this problem is very similar to a lot of thermodynamic concepts.  If you can determine the direction of a macroscopic correlation, then the influence of microscopic deviations about the mean becomes mathematically irrelevant.
A good example is entropy.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases; yet on a microscopic scale there's no reason that fluctuations about the mean can't bring about a localized decrease in entropy.  If you had about 8L of gas particles, is there any reason that they couldn't arbitrarily turn out to fit into an volume 0.00001% smaller than they started with?  Entropically, this couldn't happen, but it seems fairly plausible from a microscopic standpoint.
Well, you're in luck, because I already had to calculate the odds of such a sample of gas spontaneously shrinking into a volume smaller than its container.  6.24064×10^(−99887680887806762) are the odds that you're looking at.
In an analogous example, couldn't variations in the rates that users create and delete accounts mean that a bunch of alt accounts could get deleted while a lesser amount of actual accounts are created (assuming that accounts are deleted randomly, independently of their status as alts or real accounts)?  There's no reason it couldn't happen.  But statistically, it doesn't.
More importantly, saying that "it's not likely, but it's possible" is tantamount to admitting that your argument was complete bullshit and you have to go pander to infinitesimal odds.  After all of the hullabaloo you made over my initial argument ("I can respect your 'extremist' views, but it's like saying if a murder happens we should either throw everyone in jail or no one at all. Ridiculous."), it's pretty pathetic that as soon as an actual substantive argument comes up that you turn tail and run.
In fact, despite all the bullshit you spew about trolls ruining reddit, your actions (post inflammatory statement; make dismissive replies and leave when you're called out) are far more troll-like than mine (stating an actual argument).

Why is it inherently more untenable of an argument than claiming that Bitcoin will "work"?  As you said, time will tell -- there's no amount of data that can prove one way or another whether Bitcoin will rise to the front of the global financial market.  You take issue with the fact that I am of the *opinion* that Bitcoin won't take over, and you assume that I'm not even willing to entertain the notion (I am, and I decided to dismiss it).
My personal opinion: Bitcoin as a medium of exchange will continue to exist, will probably build up a dedicated following and see niche use (especially where it truly excels: darknet exchanges), possibly become a household name but never overturn the existing structure.  Bitcoin as an asset will be speculated on for years until it reaches a semblance of stability, at which point the allure of going "to the moon" will wear off and plenty of speculators who were more invested in the price of bitcoin than the utility will pull out.
Of course, this is just my opinion.  Time will tell.

I'm honestly surprised how many people are assuming that the businesses are offering this 10% discount out of the goodness of their hearts, because they save so much money by switching to Bitcoin and are excited to pass on those savings to you.  Clearly this discount will last forever!

It is a Tragedy of the Commons.  Mining at GHash.io is preferable, because not only does it have no fees, as the largest pool it has the least variance in pay.  As a miner, having a consistent payout for your work is very important.
The key here is to realize that no single miner controls enough hashrate for them switching away from GHash.io to make a difference.  For each individual miner, it's in their best interests for them to keep mining at GHash.io and hope that everyone else switches away.

* bitcoin will never become more than an alternative to the existing currency system (it's useful for money transfers, black-market goods, and high-risk speculation, not much else).
I laugh because I think ancap ideology is ridiculous and unsustainable, and I think it's foolish to believe that bitcoin will materialize their dreams of corporate hegemony.

It's an expected value problem.

I can think there's a 99.9% chance of hitting Black 2 on a roulette wheel and bet my life savings on it accordingly, but that doesn't make me less of a sucker if I get lucky and win.

The thing is that whether or not you've accurately gauged Satoshi's motives, and even if you make the (fairly unreasonable) assumption that every speculator is as calm, rational, and pragmatic as you are, finding out that Satoshi *can* move those coins -- that he hasn't destroyed the keys already -- means that the market could find itself suddenly saturated for no real reason, faster than you could possibly react.  If Satoshi hasn't destroyed the keys, then it's possible that the coins could get stolen.  Maybe Satoshi could get hacked (it's not impossible).  Even if you consider him some sort of cryptography god, he could be vulnerable to social engineering -- maybe even blackmail or torture.  Maybe the feds find him and seize them -- who knows?  If Satoshi's coins move even a satoshi (heh), then all kinds of horrible possibilities for the market unfold.  That's all they are, of course -- possibilities -- but assuming that none of these things *could* happen is tremendously shortsighted.
While it's easy to claim that you'd take a calm and measured approach to such a revelation, it's obvious that far from everyone in Bitcoin space would agree with you.  If enough people panic and the price plunges drastically, it could hurt you -- the long-term speculator -- the most.

The Martingale just changes a half chance of doubling your money and a half chance of losing it to a 1-(2^-n) chance of increasing your money by roughly log base n of 2, with a 2^-n chance of losing all your money.
For example, you can turn 50:50 odds for winning or losing 128 BTC into a 127/128 chance of winning 128/127 BTC, with a 1/128 chance of losing 128 BTC.
By decreasing the average size of each win, you can decrease the probability of a loss, but the magnitude of a loss will remain the same (all your money), and the expected value will never, NEVER change.
Add in a house edge/cut, and you will ALWAYS lose in the long run, especially if you make multiple bets like the Martingale system demands.

Funny, I thought you had to go to school to be an engineer.  
For someone who claims to know what they're talking about, you're awful full of hot air.  You literally had to resort to the argument "it's not likely, but it's possible" as a reason that you *might* be correct.
Accounts correlate positively with users, because all users must have accounts even if more than one account maps to a single user.  This means that d(users)/d(accounts) is positive, which means that d(accounts)/d(users) is positive.  This means that on average, d(users)/d(time) will decrease if d(accounts)/d(time) decreases.
If you are an engineer, I sincerely hope I never have to use anything you've designed.

Creating gold through fusion is pretty much chemically impossible.  Only elements lower than iron are energetically favorable to fuse; elements greater than iron have nuclear binding energies that favor fission.
Extracting gold from seawater is also not cost-effective because of the limits of modern chemical and physical separation processes and the low density of gold in seawater.  This could change, but it would require an enormous leap forward in the way that we extract and purify compounds; it isn't going to happen in the near future.
Mining gold from ~~asteroids~~ extraplanetary bodies (no common asteroids contain cost-effective levels of gold; extracting gold from them would require a similar revolution necessary to that needed to extract gold from seawater (the only common asteroid classes are silicaceous, carbonaceous, and metallic (iron/nickel, no heavy metals (yay nested parentheses)))) will not be cost-effective for even longer.
We will likely not see efficient methods for the production of *new* gold in this century, let alone this decade.

I don't understand why you're characterizing *my* standpoint as extreme, considering you're actually arguing that since we can't fit a correlation between (# of accounts) and (# of users) such a correlation must not exist.  No, we have no idea what the relationship is, but we can be 100% sure that the correlation is *positive* -- that is, if the userbase of reddit increases, then the number of accounts must *necessarily* have increased.  Having established that the correlation is positive, reducing the rate of new account formation (assuming it's done in an independent way -- i.e. applied uniformly to all new accounts) will necessarily decrease the rate of new user adoption.  This follows trivially, because it sure as hell won't increase it.
Your statement that "...the amount of 'accounts' will be lowered, but this is a highly inflated statistic and holds no relevance to Reddit's or actual growth." is completely and blatantly false.  If you define growth as user adoption (which is a completely reasonable metric) then decreasing the rate of account growth will *at best* not change the rate of user adoption ***if the new measures only ever stopped alt account formation and never hindered a legitimate user from registering*** -- which is a completely ridiculous scenario to begin with!
I'm even completely disregarding the fact that you are literally considering to be representative of all of reddit (which is ridiculous, because it's a subset thereof, and is certainly not characteristic of the entire site).  Contrary to what you may believe, what's bad for is not necessarily bad for reddit.  Alt account formation may piss off some who think theirs is the only opinion to have ever been challenged on the internet, but the ease of account creation on reddit as a whole is definitely a reason for its past growth (lurkers convert to users more easily, alt accounts allow for all sorts of shenanigans like anonymous AskReddit threads, etc.)

Some people believe that GHash.io may be spending excess hashing power to selfish mine at competing pools, decreasing their apparent block finding rate under the guise of "bad luck".  I've yet to see this substantiated, but if it's a common fear then I can see how miners might play off that.
A coordinated switch from GHash.io runs into completely different ones -- logistical ones.  No single person (as of yet) has decided to wield enough authority to organize a group of miner that's large enough to remove a decisive amount of hashing power from GHash.io.  Moreover, why does the onus to organize such a boycott fall on the miners?  As someone who's invested in Bitcoin, isn't it also in *your* best interest to organize such a switch?  Why haven't you gone around personally contacting hundreds, if not thousands, of miners, in a concerted effort to wrest a percent or two of control away from GHash.io?
Your analogy to stone-age mammoth hunters is a flawed one, for several reason (disregarding the fact that mammoth hunting displays an astounding amount of teamwork and cooperation).  What you're really asking for here is the organization of a mass protest, or a boycott of sorts.  There's no reason for a miner to grab a dozen friends and switch networks, for the same reason that there's no incentive for a single miner to switch -- even a dozen miners don't wield enough relative power to make a difference.  If you're wondering why the miners haven't congealed around a single protest leader yet, it's because no one is willing to step forth and organize a concerted movement from GHash.io.  Why?  Probably for the same reasons that you haven't done done so.

Debatable.  A substantial portion of the gold on earth is in the oceans, and it's not even that hard to get out, it's just hard to extract it cost-effectively.

I honestly cannot believe that you went through all that bullshit without understanding what the complex plane is.

I'm not surprised, given your record with this sort of stuff.


First of all, *complex is not the same is imaginary*.  Complex=imaginary+real.  You can't have a single "complex axis"; the combination of a real axis and an imaginary axis generates a complex plane.  You can't talk about the "complex part of x", because x is a complex number and the complex part is *all of it*.  For the remainder of this post, I'm going to assume that by "the complex part" you meant "the imaginary part", because you literally didn't know any better because book learning is for chumps, amirite?
Secondly, we can be sure that your question is literally meaningless because a complex number has two components: a real part and an imaginary part (this is the definition of a complex number, numbnuts).  If x and y are both complex, they both have their own independent real and imaginary components, because anything else *wouldn't make sense*.  If x=1+i, and y=2+2i, then you can plot it on a 4-dimensional complex chart in the position (1, i, 2, 2i), where the formatting is (obviously) (real(x), imag(x), real(y), imag(y)).  To say that "the ~~complex~~ imaginary part of x and y is on the same axis" just means that you're setting imag(x)=imag(y), which is a completely arbitrary and unnecessary distinction that is no more meaningful than setting real(x)=real(y) (and will probably render any interesting polynomials you're solving degenerate).


Again, complex =&gt; imaginary.  And the answer is "for the same reason we assume that their real components are independent", which is to say "for the same reason that we assume that their entire complex forms are independent", which is to say "for the same reason that ***THEY'RE NOT THE SAME FUCKING VARIABLE***!


NO!  THAT IS NOT WHAT A QUATERNION IS!
Quaternions are essentially a set of 3 imaginary units that form a cyclical framework with real units (i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1).  Just because a system has 4 independent components does not make it a quaternion! 


[Dude, you can just solve x^2 = x + 1 as the roots of a single fucking parabola.](  Also, a "line" and a "curve" are very different things.  You can't call a parabola a line.


[Actually, it just gives you the exact same parabola, except one unit higher.](  In fact, I'd argue that the solutions to this polynomial equation are a lot more fundamental than the solutions to the equation above.  0 and 1 matter a lot more than (1±√5)/2.


All you're doing is finding the roots of various polynomials.  You aren't giving any reasons that the values you're getting are interesting, besides that they solve algebraic expressions you're pulling out of a hat.


Wow, it turns out that math can be expressed in multiple ways! 


It probably won't, because the polynomials you're picking are completely arbitrary.  Your logic is "ϕ contains a √5 term, and 5 is a prime, so a higher-dimensional ϕ (which you have no reason to believe exists besides blind faith) should be expressed in terms of the root of the next prime, √7".


How about first you list the reasons that a higher-dimensional ϕ should exist?  


While, if true, that would produce a satisfying and symmetrical result, you have no basis for making this claim.  Take a math class.


Generally, you want to fully understand a concept before you question it, let alone build upon it.
Here's a question for you: why don't you ever care about the conjugate of ϕ?  x^2 = x + 1 has *two* solutions, but I only ever see you harping on one of them.  (1-√5)/2 works just as well as (1+√5)/2.  Why don't you chew on that for a while?  Maybe later you can tell me all about how ϕ' is the basis for a whole new number system, or some other bullshit.

If the only reason to participate is altruism, and (like every crypto hash) ASICs will eventually be developed, in the end this project will become "whoever can afford the most miners chooses the discourse of the encyclopedia".  
Free speech isn't something you should have to bid for.  Wikipedia works because anyone can edit it, and all the altruistic editors have to do is sort the wheat from the chaff.  That's why wikipedia can go so in-depth on incredibly niche topics without descending into general anarchy on a sitewide level.
You know who *really* cares what's being said about them on the internet?  [C](  A blockchain wikipedia would quickly become a PR-fest.

No, I generally earn my accomplishments instead of awarding them to myself.

I'm going to take your statement at face value, because I apparently have nothing better to do.
Exclusivity is not synonymous with prestige.  A school that only accepts one student a year can still be a shitty school, if that student is you.

Wow.  Life must be really hard for someone who's enough of a recognized authority in every field to award themselves honorary degrees.  But if you're already enough of an authority to award yourself a degree, what's the point of giving yourself a degree in the first place?
Either you're stuck in some weird academic ouroboros, or your masturbatory self-congratulation is completely meaningless and can't stand up to scrutiny from anyone with the faintest qualifications in whatever field you're posturing in today.  Maybe that's why, despite all of your grandiose claims, nothing you've ever done has ever amounted to anything.
I'm sure it's the ouroboros thing.  Awarding yourself academic degrees isn't delusional or narcissistic at all!

It's spelled "cryonicist", and the word is more applicable to those who study cryonics than those who partake in it.
Also, no.

You dumbass.  Not only is your "magical identity" *literally a quartic polynomial*, ***you somehow managed to get every single root to the polynomial incorrect***.
[I solved your fucking polynomial on paper.  You screwed up calculating every single x-component.](   [Even Wolfram|Alpha agrees with me.]( 
And *even* if you managed to get this trivial piece of fucking **high-school math** correct, at the end of the day you'd be left with a fucking meaningless polynomial, not "Euler 2: Electric Boogaloo".
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:09:03
Yeah, famous people generally have to *accept* honorary degrees from institutions in order for them to mean anything.  I've already discussed why your "higher-dimensional golden ratios" theory is bullshit.
I wonder if you'll feign surprise when you get accepted into your own imaginary university.
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:49:28
Oh my fucking god you have got to be kidding me.  Both of those images *agree with me*.  The x solutions are 0, -1+i, and -1-i.
You are failing utterly at motherfucking ***10th-grade algebra***.  Please, compare yourself to Andrew Wiles again.

And while I can see the parallels to Bitcoin, I feel like this comic is more targeted toward science journalism specifically.

You'll also find plenty of people latching onto "*hella-*" as the next-highest SI prefix. Until the International Bureau of Weights and Measures standardizes it, there's no official consensus.  "*xenna-, weka-, vendeka*" would satisfy the current trend of using Greek-derived prefixes for increasing orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:36:44
Actually, it's *xenna-, weka-, vendeka-* from Greek "nine, ten, eleven".

Because we all know how much of an economic superpower Antarctica is, what with it making up 9.3% of the land area of the world and all.  That means that it produces 9.3% of the global GDP!
Also, this has jack-all to do with game theory, which you're just using as a nebulous buzzword.

No, it was proposed by Tim Draper (yes, that Tim Draper), has little to no public support, would cut vital aqueduct lines that run north/south, and would simultaneously create the richest and some of the poorest states in the union.
It's for Silicon Valley billionaires who are pissed that their taxes have to support the Central Valley and such.  They want to take their ball and go home.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:48:24
No. There are no meaningful papers published that support your hypothesis.

I have access to an NMR facility and an XRD facility, and my lab has a PXRD, an ICP-AES, an ASAP, and a SQUID, along with some more prototypical instruments.  I just took a pic from where I was at the moment. 
...and if you're a biologist (not that you've shown any proof that you are), I'd be surprised if you've ever taken a single course on quantum.  
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:26:39
I can sure as hell read it.  I somehow doubt you wrote it.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:21:58
*Nature* is the only reputable source you posted, and that link does not validate, or indeed espouse, any of the claims you made.
Do you have *any* formal training in physics?
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:19:49
I'm glad to know I kept you up all night.  Take a quantum course.
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:24:39
Sure, but any scientist would display extreme doubt of any theory that broke all the existing laws of physics.  Look at all the people that made fools of themselves after that neutrino FTL debacle.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:56:26
[Your turn!]( 
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:32:54
Do you want to elaborate on that? Maybe post some proof? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:23:48
This is not a scientific paper.  
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:45:43
No, entangled particles can't transfer any information FTL.  They just have entangled states, they don't reference each other after their creation.
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:49:25
[Good for you.  Here's a million-dollar SQUID and a tank of liquid helium.]( 
And again, I doubt a biologist has any formal training in quantum mechanics, so I don't see how you are in any way knowledgeable on this topic.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:08:56
This paper deals with qubits and quantum committing, but that's not the same as FTL communication.  *Any* sort of FTL communication would undermine pretty much all of known physics. It's not coming any time soon
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:25:10
Yeah, I'm working in a research lab at a top-tier university at the moment. Try again.
I'll post proof if you want, too.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:47:49
It will not. Entangled particles can't transfer meaningful information FTL.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:09:18
Ha.  I'll take that to mean you're another "futurologist" with no real knowledge of science whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:11:50
Yeah, I'm gonna call bullshit unless you can show me your qualifications.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:46:37


Not, considering entanglement does not circumvent the no-communication theorem.

None of that has anything to do with breaking the no-communication theorem. Your Nature article is about encoding Shakespeare in DNA.
