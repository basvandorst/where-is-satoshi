Well, they're also based on different algorithms making it impossible to switch your rigs between the two. Is that an ideological reasoning as well? :)

Don't think Dogecoin ever had that low of a volume, except maybe in the first day or so. And really you're the one making the claims that lots of Dogeoin holders are converting to Reddcoin. If that was true the volume would be significantly higher, so I questioned your argument. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:55:14
I'm sorry but that's a silly thing to say. Everyone can't give out big tips so if someone can only afford to tip a few Doges that's great considering that they probably are giving out a larger % of their coins. Furthermore, the idea of internet tipping is not to pay someones salary or makes people rich, it's primarily a way of showing appreciation with something more substantial than a "like" or a "vote up". I get very happy even if someone just tips me a single Doge.

This is people here won't actually spend their coins until they are at least 100 000 $, at which point they will sell them for fiat :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:19:32
Yeah that 5000 dollar 24h volume sure shows how many people are just rushing to buy Reddcoin ^^

Lol buddy, bad day today or what? Do you yell at kids playing at your lawn and write letters to the local newspaper complaining about the price of stamps too? :D
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:26:19
That's cool, hope it goes through. There was some problems with the tipbot the other day so please hit me up if you haven't received them by tomorrow and I'll re-send them. :) Would be cool to start a charity for the guys who lost their coins on Gox but we're talking about potentially many millions of dollars as you pointed out so it might be tricky to reimburse everyone. I feel for the ones who lost out, I was lucky enough to be able to withdraw before all this happened. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:59:31
Thanks! Although I'm sure you know that Bitcoin is more inflationary for the next several years.

You got it all wrong you long-haired hippie! The world is cold, hard, ugly and brutal and the only way to get ahead is to fuck people over. Big business is great, greed is the only motivating factor and... hey where's everyone going? Jeez... I wonder why no one is listening to me? :/
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:45:57
People like to think in dualities. The stereotype of a profitable business model is serious and boring, so people tend to look down on business ventures that are more fun and lighthearted. That is until they turn into Google,  Virgin Galactic and Twitter that is :-)

It remains to be seen but I think it's allright to be carefully optimistic. They had to make up their minds one way or the other. Anything but an outright ban is good news in my book.
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:50:10
One of the reasons, yes. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:25:49
Even if Dogecoin got to 8 cents (10x increase in value) people would still tip each other a few Dogecoins. There is no danger at all of Dogecoin becoming so valuable that no one would want to spend it since there is such a huge supply of coins. 
Tipping server to purposes; it's fun to reward people and it helps the community grow. If you and I are at a bar and you tell me a funny story I might buy you a beer. Online we lack that connection, and that is why online tipping is so cool. It bridges the social gap that is produced by distance.

Lol it's funny how many people get furious because of these silly comic strips :D Half the fun is in the comments.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:08:27
Oh right, yes that actually makes sense. I thought you meant that people with small wallets shouldn't tip, but I see what you're getting at and I agree. :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:01:25
I thought it already was :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:09:50
Maybe the hot wallet was hacked and they for some reason haven't been able to access the cold one until now? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:21:15
Definitely good news. Maybe the rumour that Mark just wrote shitty code and temporarily lost the Bitcoins is true? Wouldn't surprise me at this point to be honest. Mark is not one to inspire great confidence in his abilities...

No that's incorrect, but thank you for trying to point me in the right direction :) Inflation in this context is new coins being minted and entering the market, and Bitcoin will have a higher percentage rate of inflation for the next several years. If you'd like to try and dispute that I welcome you to provide some sources and I'll have a look at them.

Almost two million dollars in volume should tell you something. You can't really look at the price when the market is this uncertain though. Something absolutely crazy would have to happen for anything to increase substantially now (except for artificial pumps). More importantly Dogecoin is growing very quickly as a community, and more and more people are becoming involved. When the infrastructure grows it's just a matter of time before price follows. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:18:26
Key word here being "a few". You originally stated that "most" Dogecoiners are converting to Reddcoin. I called you on it and you provide me with five examples, one being a guy just contemplating switching over and one being a guy splitting his investment 50/50. So really you got 3 people, and you call that "most" people in Dogecoin. Again, your volume over the last 24 hours is slightly over 7000 dollars. If what you say was true the volume would be significantly higher.

Moolah.io covers the rest. :-)

Well, no he probably wouldn't invest in something that is four months old but that doesn't dispute my point. That's like saying that Bitcoin is useless because Bill Miller didn't invest in it three years ago. More to my point there's talk of Twitter, Github and several other companies picking up the Dogetipbot and integrating it in their services. Furthermore GoCoin, which just received millions of dollars in funding, will accept Dogecoins very shortly. Also our subreddit is growing by several hundred to about a thousand in subscribers daily.

@_date: 2014-03-28 00:08:57
Yes, the subscriber rate for Reddcoin has been higher for a few days. Surprisingly though Reddcoin at the time of writing only has 42 subscribers online, whereas Dogecoin has close to a thousand. I'm not sure what to make of that other than that it's quite suspicions that so many people are suddenly subscribing to Reddcoin, but almost no one is online. I'll just leave it at that and let you make what you want out of it ;)
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:29:03
And now we have resorted to namecalling... I suggest we stop this here. Someone not understanding inflation in an economic argument is sort of if a soccerplayer admitted to not knowing what a football is. Seems sort of pointless to go on from here really. Have a nice day! :)

That's not really true though. Dogecoin will be added to GoCoin in the next few days and the creator of the Dogetipbot is at Coinsummit right now pitching his company to investors. Payment processor company Moolah.io is based primarily on Dogecoin, and lots of business are accepting Dogecoin every day. You don't have to be either boring and profitable or fun and silly. Look at Richard Branson, he's a very good businessman and an excellent marketer at the same time. No reason you can't do both.

No that's pretty much the textbook definition. The fact that there can only ever exist 21 million Bitcoins does not mean it's not an inflationary currency at the time of writing, it means that it will become deflationary when the cap is reached. Sorry, I'm not trying to be rude but I'm not sure how you could have invested in Bitcoin without knowing this. Furthermore I'm not sure how you connect the argument of inflation to not owning Doge. If few coins and deflation is all you're after then 42 coin would be the best investment by far.
