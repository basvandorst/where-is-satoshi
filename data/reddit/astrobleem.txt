    That's right, from now until we ship our ASIC products, we are giving away 1 FPGA single per week, and     to make things even sweeter, we are upgrading that single to a "Little" Single for FREE! That's right - 30 GH/s for free!
    What's the catch? You have to work a little bit for it, but it's easy work. We want your signatures.
    You must change your Bitcoin Talk signatures to the following:
    PHP Code:
    [B]60 GH/s BFL Single SC[/B] - [COLOR=RED][B]Pre-Order Yours Today![/B][/COLOR]
    `````` [COLOR=black]Only $1299.99[/COLOR] - [B][url]butterflylabs.com[/url][/B] ``````  
    Once you've changed your signature, post a reply in this thread and that's it! You're entered into the      contest.

Well dude, I'm very proud of you that you're so super smart and already know how to do all these things that you can just "whip up in 10 minutes" good on you, really. I am learning and experimenting.
I'm not sure what you think i might be trying to do by giving you false readings, but you don't have to look there.
i'm going to try and take all of your constructive critisisms on board and fix them. if you inspect the source, you can see that with the bitcoin, Bitcoin, that text is also nested inside microdata, which I havent fluffed out yet, but according to google's validator tool, it's straight, and if it ever gets indexed, the next time someone searches for 1 btc to usd someone might get a semi-relevant result.
if you are also some sort of design wizard then maybe you can offer some help mixing the microdata with html to make something that doesnt look so stupid. 
obviously i'm going to put a link to my own blog on the page. you can hate me for that, I guess, if you REALLY want to but there are no advertisements on the front page of this domain, and i'm also displaying the a link that has no text. 
i'm open to suggestions, but i am not going to change on the currency or calculating, as you said all the others do that.
why would you want to do that manually? well, genius, you're not buying it from me. and i'm really suprised that, judging by how smart you say you are you would need a calculator to do that.

When I presented it here, I got feedback, and ideas. I think overall it was successfull.  I don't care about the downvotes. I'm not offended either. I didnt downvote you, I'm not butthurt.
I will investigate bootstrap, I have never heard of it. the html is handcrafted. 


title is "1 bitcoin to usd"
domain name is 1btc.info
I'm sorry if I mislead you.
The reason this exists, if you go to google and type in "1 btc to usd" the results that are returned are not relevant.
if you type in, for example, "1 eur to usd"
google has provided a nice little inline answer, and the first 3 results at glance I can see have in their description the exchange rate, havent clicked on anything and i already have a pretty decent idea of what the rate is. that's all I care about...
sorry if I didnt appear to be taking the criticism, I even replied in the same post that it was "constructive criticism" 
The idea is that with the microdata it will have the updated price right there in the search result for anyone who gives a shit, since google refuses for whatever reason to implement this tool. why not fill the niche? just because it's easy to do doesnt mean there's not a place for it. because clearly, looking at the results. it belongs right there.

You can be as careless as you want with your transactions. I wish you the best of luck!
@_date: 2013-05-25 03:49:50
no, you are not sharing your private key with the network, you are signing a message with your private key, and the public key is used to decrypt to verify that you signed it.
You are not sending money, you are signing a cheque that says take these coins from this piggy bank and put them in this one.
The miners verify that the signature is yours by decrypting your privately signed message with the public key. The transaction is confirmed, bob is your uncle and a new block on the blockchain describing where your coins came from and where they went is created.
The only time you need to "re-backup" your wallet is when you create a new keypair and receving address in your wallet. All of the accounting is done on the blockchain. Your wallet is just a pocket with keys in it.

1.) Open source. No one owns it. And anyone can change it. But the majority of users / power would have to agree to that change.
2.) There are companies like bitpay that handle the currency conversion for merchants that may not understand / have time to deal with the risk of the price changing. Some people may wish to accept the gamble. As unfavorably bad as you can imagine a loss, you can also realize a gain.
3.) The set limit of bitcoins has not been reached yet. They are released at a steady and predictable rate, which will not happen untill after we're all gone and dead. So even if someone manged to scoop up all of todays coins, there will still be another 11 million released. 
4.) It is backed by the users. It is backed by the miners. It's backed by the traders, and it's backed by the Investors. It's also backed by drugs, the black market, and gambling.
5.) What is the goal? To get a high score. When the set limit is reached? The coins are divisible.
6.) Desire to access will overcome ignorance.

I invited to be a moderator, and so far they have not done anything but reply in the threads. 
Here's a screenshot of our mod log.
It's pretty boring.
No one has deleted your post.
It may have gotten caught in a spam filter or you forgot to hit submit or fuck, I don't know. I've never moderated a sub before so I'm not sure what I'm doing, but it doesnt look like (the only other moderator of that reddit) did it, and I'm sure it wasn't me!
I hope you get your coins.

All together for readability.
I had planned on updating everyone with a video of a board hashing here in KC tonight, but I havent been able to get that together yet, so I'mprobably going to have to push it off until tomorrow. We are targeting a start of shipment next week, but i'm not quite ready to commit to that at the moment giving our past estimates. It's imminent, though.
We may miss our power targets, that's been part of the hold up. we think there's a problem with the power consumption and we're trying to figure out where it's having an issue. However, in the interests of time, we are going to be shipping what we have and going back and fixing while we are shipping.
The power is still far less than any other unit, so it's not like it's somethign crazy or anything, but it's not 1w/GH and we're trying to locate the source of the power drain.
the rest of the 6 wafers, we have been holding off on the last 5 layers for the rest of the chips to be sure we don't need to make a tweak in the metal layer due to the power issue. I think we've pretty much settled that the power issue is NOT in the chip.
if the cooling becomes an issue, like I said we'd scale it back and ship multiple units.
Worst case is 195w, but the power systems aren't rated to handle that, so we'd back off the hashrate before we'd let it get that high.
We will ship the purchased hashrate regardless of what it ends up costing us.

Its probably more profitable to start mining altcoins than sell GPU. Also, buying a used GPU that was used for mining is probably similar to buying a used car where the previous owner floored it and did burnouts at every stoplight.

People say they buy them because mining is "fun" 
Yes, plugging in a usb dongle and clicking a mouse a few times and walking away is a real blast.

You're late to the game. Buy Btc is probably your safest bet.

Don't forget to downvote and report.

I have used them 3 times and it has worked flawlessly and quickly for me.
Every single day there are several new posts of people in this very reddit who bitinstant did not work for. just look at is damning enough evidence of this. 
In short, if you had asked me a couple months ago I would have endorsed them. Today, I warn you against.

RES tagged! Hope you're right, replying so I can say I posted right after the guy who saw through all the bullshit and predicted that Bitcoins are going to crash in April 2013. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:44:39
If we panic buy when they panic sell everything will work out okay.

So it is a link to something where you comment on a video? Cool, why didn't you just put the comments on one of the other 50 times someone has posted this same video in this same subreddit in the last week?
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:14:09
You should not order.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:19:46
What? a few mirrors? That's all it fucking takes? Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?
You just blew my mind by adding tor into the mix. Are you a hacker?
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:44:24
Bitcoin will stand on its own merits or fall flat because of them. In the long run it doesn't matter who says what. Having said that I was not defending him, AT ALL. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 16:16:25
just do a google search for 1 bitcoin to usd then.
1btc to usd, is even worse. it points to some twitter account, who was regularly tweeting it, but stopped a few days ago.

the "chattering classes" twice in one paragraph.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:54:14
If they're not going to flash all their extravagance around for you to show me examples why would you use that as your leading argument? What does it prove that someone's relative is a convicted criminal? I think most of us have a black sheep in our family too, does that mean we are all shady? I really am all for bashing BFL but you just sound stupid.

They would be doing us a huge favor, it would mean cheap bitcoins could be purchased for a short period of time!
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:48:29
People willing to sell their bitcoins for dollars is a good thing. It means not everyone is hoarding. You need spenders and savers for this thing to work.

@_date: 2013-04-27 23:29:08
I beleive that is the owner, a 20 something year old, and a moderator in this subreddit. Ask him what his name is. 
It's pretty fucking dumb to instantly assume that it was SN.

If you try to set the payout threshold to something too high most of them will even tell you that they're not a bank.

Who said that illegal items were the only thing that could be purchased with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:35:20
I was thinking that their servers might appreciate that. If lots of people happened to be looking at it at once it might space out the pinging.
**edit** it's also a side affect of copying and pasting the editing the right code.
