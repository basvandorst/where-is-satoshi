It's about a persons ability to think futuristically. Certain people are too caught up in the moment to even entertain what will happen several years down the line. Think it has to do with smart phones + the constant sea of information (or mostly mis and disinformation) that people are exposed to on the reg. Weeding through the bs and spending time researching and delving into different rabbit holes has always been natural. For others, this isn't part of their existence 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:03:58

I agree with you. I'm also heavy into xmr but lets be real, xmr and it's adversaries will continued to be seen as the "criminal" coins, if you will. Won't have much of an effect on xmr in the long term though.

For anyone watching CNBC, that Scott Golloday segment was incredible. Also, I love that stupid blonde bitch saying "but there are plenty of unsophisticated investors getting into crypto." Scott rebuts by saying "like there aren't unsophisticated investors in the nasdaq?" lmao. CNBC obviously wants to knock crypto down a few pegs because it doesn't fit their agenda. It's laughable

I am still buying bitcoin because I was a "late" adopter (first purchase in July) and I believe in Bitcoin's future and protocol. An entire generation of people accept having to interact with a third party intermediary in order to control their funds. This is not a world I want to partake in (or as little as I possibly can). Being able to act as my own bank and liberate myself from the crutches of these multinational corporations who clearly don't have our best interests in mind is a legit goal of mine for the future.

I had a buddy last summer tell me he bought bitcoin at 500 and I literally did not even comprehend anything he was saying. He sold it at 750 and was happy with his gains LOL. Looking back on that moment, realizing what bitcoin now means for the financial freedom and liberation from the state, makes me wonder why the fuck I shrugged it off so quickly. I usually dive into rabbit holes. Fortunately I've been in since May so made some $ but there will always be a what if. Nevertheless, expect many people on this thread to call you retarded, all those adjectives. Make sure you read up on bitcoin and understand it from an theoretical standpoint and it what it represents for the millions of unbanked people in the world. It's important not to just get in for the $ (as much as we all want to make fat gains)

because aapl has limited upside, when it reaches 1T its a 15% bump in price. Say it gets to a massive 1.5T in a few years, thats like a 90% jump. And by that time, btc will likely have jumped another 10x
