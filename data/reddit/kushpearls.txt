If your business accepts bitcoin you can can choose to have it immediately turned into USD. I think a lot of businesses get scared away from btc cause they don't understand that they could just have their transactions immediately change a customers btc into cash and have it deposited in their account as USD and not have to hold onto the bitcoins. Aka if I buy something for 1btc from your business it will get deposited as cash in your account and you never have to deal with switching it over to USD yourself. No need to have any clue about btc, just the willingness to set up a business account with coinbase really.

Not at all. There's really no connection between the two at all.

BOA is legally allowed to do this.

Ya think "buisness days", weekends dont count in the banking world, yet another problem with how they work.

I cant agree more with the statement "Bitcoin requires effort and research to actually understand it".

Here is my method for getting my doubter friends into BTC. No one ever wants to spend their own money at first so i tell them "Listen friend, I will buy $50 worth of BTC today with my money and I will set it aside for you in a wallet I will create for you". Then I tell them in a few weeks or so I will offer them the wallet and ask if they would like to buy the wallet off of me for $50. Works like a charm, no has refused the deal yet ;)

You never heard of alchemy bro? Those dudes made gold all day, everyday.

I agree. A simple "Oh I'm sorry but I don't discuss my banking practices over the phone, it is not safe." would have saved OP a lot of hassle here. Its the more polite version of "Nunya" I think.

Watch the vice doc on soylent. You will defiently stay away from it after that. Hint: theres a rat.

So if I place an order right now for .2 BTC for $200.00 and lets say the price doubles by Dec. 5th then do I only receive .1 BTC? Is that how it works?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:19:37
Is it by all means, legal. Does no one read their agreement when they sign up for a bank account?
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:54:56
Lets say I buy an item from a store for 1 btc. When a buisness takes my bitcoin is it instantly tranfered into USD and placed in their account? I was wondering how buisnesses dont lose money with the constant price change .I can buy an item for 1 btc and later in th afternoon the price could drop $50 and is now the buisness eating that loss?  A simple explanation on how buisnesses use btc would be great.

No, cause they can do whatever they want. There's a lot, A LOT, of small print when you open bank accounts, any action they take I am sure is legally covered. You do know that once you deposit your money into any bank, its actually legally their money right? We just need to stop playing their game (aka using the banking system).
