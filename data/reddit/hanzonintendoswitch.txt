I’d say we are still in the Stone Age of Crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:54:18
Soo... We will all get rich with Crypto? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:38:07
The only feature all these apps are missing is helping with tax declaration in Germany. In order not to pay taxes on my Crypto investments, I need to hold my coins for at least a year. It’d be a killer feature for an app to show me which amount of coins I am able to sell right now without paying taxes for it, and for how much exactly that amount was purchased and when. It is quite hard to keep track of the “left overs” that exist with this law, since all the movements are calculated first in, first out. 
Do you see this as a possible feature in the near future? I’d pay some money for an app that can do that (and I would recommend it to all my fellow german Crypto friends).

But the price afterwards is absurd. I wanted something to use long term. Thanks anyway.

At least the lyrics are pretty ea.. TWELVE!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:53:01
Just tracking which amounts were made more than a year ago is not difficult at all. And I am sure there are other countries with similar laws. 
I was just giving the guy an idea to make his app special. The german market is huge after all. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:55:34
Is it good for Europe as well?

What if she got wealthy as a premium prostitute?
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:37:01
Me too. My dad shouts at me every day about the price he bought his bitcoin for. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:15:36
Some people just don’t know it yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:37:31
Well then I have no idea how do you plan to stand out from all the other apps. 
Good luck though.

Not so great. Any improvements planned in this regard?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:10:44
How are the fees in Monero?
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:38:24
Glad to hear it!
Question is: is this 100% wrong everywhere? If a big economy like China allows this to happen again, wouldn’t that cause a global crisis also?
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:58:57
I’d still make a profit of 40% because I bought really early. But it’d make me sad anyway. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:39:38
If we are talking about finances, I don’t ask people if they have Bitcoin, I ask them how much of their investments is in Bitcoin.

Not anymore. I set my limit at 5000€. If it goes under that, I am liquidating my assets. I thought I was out of the woods but apparently it’s still a solid possibility. :-/
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:33:15
Because I didn’t want to pay taxes. In Germany if you hold more than a year you pay zero taxes. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:59:34
That’s not true. In the last crash Gold increased a lot. There are always people with money who realize maybe it’s not such a great idea to keep all their savings on stocks. And bitcoin is a very good diversification nowadays.
I too believe that in the case of a crisis Bitcoin is going to rise. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:59:21
To realise the profits I still can. I bought it last year so I am still green. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:35:47
Nope, just Sea Shells. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:39:46
There are many more sources if you speak German. Cheers.

„you didn’t sell yours last December?”
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:53:46
I am excited. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:44:18
Is anybody here investing in it?
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:20:59
Make Bitcoin great again!
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:51:50
When that happens*
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:22:33
Also one of the biggest disadvantages of crypto over fiat. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:29:05
Is that him on the pic? Hot!
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:39:23
I’d honestly be fine with 100k bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:47:29
Yeah I hodled through 2017 and now I regret not having simply paid taxes in December. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:59:45
It will massively drop right afterwards. Round numbers are major sell walls. 
But it will rise once again later. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:09:15
3 years is nothing in terms of investment. Previous bitcoin bull runs spoiled people. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:01:52

@_date: 2018-10-02 16:01:06
At least it’s kind of stable now?
My fear is always that it plummets. If it doesn’t plummet, it will certainly rise again at some point. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:33:16
I ate one. He was delicious. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:09:20
Well many people DID get in last December, or the price would not have spiked so fast. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:29:10
As soon as the next stock crisis hits we will watch bitcoin soar again. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:23:26
Most people are always poor. The definition of being poor is not having a big amount of money. If everybody had a big amount of money the money would not be worth as much, so in order for rich people to exist most people must be poor. 
Please notice that being poor in this definition does not mean miserable or in need. My utopia is a world where everybody can lead a dignified life away from suffering and some people can still achieve extraordinary things and be specially rewarded for them. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:13:52
Bitocins were very popular back in the day. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:14:31
I am trying to figure out the motivation of people who participate on the crypto subreddits just to convince people the whole thing is falling apart. Are they part of some movement to bring the price down so they can buy more and then pump it? I find it hard to believe someone who gave up on crypto would willingly spend so much time telling everyone it’s going to zero and yadda yadda yadda. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:39:48
See? Bitcoin is getting improved every day!

@_date: 2018-03-01 12:00:45
But if I buy one euro of bitcoin today and tomorrow the price doubles and I use it to buy a coffee, didn’t I get one euro capital gain that is taxed?
In this case the coffee will only be vat exempt if i had had that bitcoin for more than a year. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:45:16
Look at how ugly he is and how gorgeous Beyoncé is. The dude must be doing something right. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:52:37
Not here in Germany. If I hold for more than a year I don’t have to pay taxes on my coins. Since taxes are about 40% of total profit, I probably have a better return holding until I complete a full year and selling when the price makes another jump. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:52:53
You can only be sorry for his loss if he sells. That’s the whole point. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:14:26
It’s been like this the last three weekends. You can buy on Thursday and sell on Sunday and consistently make money.
I’m not doing that just because of taxes. In Germany you need to hold your coins for more than a year in order not to pay taxes, so no day trading possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:54:50
They were almost right. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:52:22
You are right. It is considered currency.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:14:41
Of course. If it wasn’t they wouldn’t need to give away Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:38:57
Es ist mehr als 25% aber im Grunde hast du recht. Ich bin eher faul alles zu protokollieren und berichten ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:55:27
Only if you sold. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:51:59
Maybe he is a dog. A dog on the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:53:23
Ich habe gesagt es war so die letzten drei Wochenenden. Das wäre genug für mich etwas Geld zu investieren wenn es keine Steuern gäben aber nicht so viel wie du gesagt hast. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:27:10
What if it is 5?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:00:31
Germany already has very friendly tax laws regarding Crypto, considering it ~~an asset~~ a currency and tax free if you don’t sell it for at least one year (encouraging hodling and curbing speculation).
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:08:34
I am a kid on my 40s. Yey!
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:03:55
It’s a very nice surge if you bought yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:51:11
You can buy 10$ of it if you want. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:53:51
We all need fantasy in our lives. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:49:05
AND sold now. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:37:52
Just google for it. It’s true. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:00:31
Sicher nicht. Ich würde sehr oft Fehler machen. Hodling ist wahrscheinlich sicherer.
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:24:27
Didn’t people want bitcoin to be stable? This meme is the key. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:51:14
Good point. I started to invest in Crypto because real estate is super overpriced already and the stock market also seems to be unrealistically high, meaning it can’t go much higher. I have investments in both but I was looking for a third option.
Since I find the idea of investing in metals quite old fashioned, crypto currency is like a no brainer to me. I am confident many people will keep part of their savings in Crypto, especially after the next market crash or real estate bubble pop. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:55:39
It can go the other way too. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:03:52
It will kind of stabilise one day. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:49:21
We might spend our time wondering about the value of bitcoin, but the real value is being able to create and share amazing things like this. Enjoy every minute of your lives.
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:21:23
If I found 850 BTC I’d be too busy with prostitutes and drugs to post on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:56:32
It’s better than being detained at the airport. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:20:36
It’s about 40%, it’s part of the income tax. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:16:20
We don’t see him hit the ground. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:39:13
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 10:54:47
If they did put all their money on bitcoin or even taken another mortgage on their house their financial situation would be much less dire. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:48:13
Did she hodl until the end?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:27:05
Well unless it drops to under 1000 it won’t be worse than the Mt. Gox massacre. If bitcoin survived that, maybe it can survive now?
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:18:33
Buying those $100 coins will be much faster
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:27:42
“Unexpectedly exploded”?
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:08:28
Wow aren’t you an asshole
@_date: 2018-07-01 10:55:28
How do we make Bitcoin more attractive to women? Do we tell that all her friends are buying them?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:56:39
That is very true. The only way to kill bitcoin would be a flaw in its technology, allowing it to be hacked or manipulated. Then it’d be really dead. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:41:10
I would never tell Reddit I had a million dollars. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:47:08
Some people know. But it’s not us. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:15:52
Its much less embarrassing than what folks like Jordan Belfort did in the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:49:36

@_date: 2018-04-19 11:37:09

@_date: 2018-04-19 10:09:49

Jingle bells motherfucker
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:09:15
I don’t care about anonymity in the block chain for the big players like bitcoin, but I do appreciate that people who need anonymity (for example rebels in an oppressive regime or health practitioners who want to protect their patients identities) will have options for that as well (such as Monero). 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:27:01
It destroys all the other coins.
