Doubt it. More people still need to wake up and panic sell.

I agree. But it might not be for somebody. Just felt it needed to be pointed out 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:32:10
At this point. I’m sure you’re going to have a tough time registering anywhere quickly.

Actually a good portion of my holding is bitcoin. That doesn’t blind me from reality though. I do use GDAX and Gemini to send BTC so no fees for me. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:31:14
Yes I have. Didn’t think people on reddit were so serious lol. Lighten up.

I wonder if they’ll let you send to an external wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:07:57
Gemini is a really good option.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:50:13
Is that to pay for the transaction fee? Lol
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:51:58
They only pay up to 30 withdrawals a month.

Luckily I reduced my position at close to peaks. But even then I also only had what I could afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:59:20
Gemini covers the fee for up to 30 withdraws a month.

I'll outbid both of you. And then we drive the price back up to where it was before it crashed to 0.

Lmfao! This is how I figure everybody when talking to them about cryptos online. Including myself.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:57:37
Honestly I think they’re just trying to keep people from defaulting in their payments from bad trades in this volatile market. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:36:25
Lol. No actually. But thanks for pointing it out. Are you great at puzzles? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:30:26
Looks like Fry’s

Knew it! Lol. I also went to this one all the time when I lived in SD. Thankfully there’s one also near me here in Vegas.
