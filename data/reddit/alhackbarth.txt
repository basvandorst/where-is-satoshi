Looks like Doge is getting love in China. Maybe Dogecoin should sponsor something near and dear to their hearts. Hmm.

I don't plan on it. Thanks for looking out for the community. Still could use help. Hopefully someone will point me in the right direction.

Then just send to hardware, yes? Thanks.

Plan on trying in the morning. Hoping to get answers from community overnight on the subject too.

I just need info on what to do to convert my "old" private key so I can sweep to my hardware account.

No luck. Still can't withdraw my bitcoin. Ugh.

Still no luck. According to their site, BTC holders have no options available.

Come for a fully-decentralized social network. Acquiring AMPs is just a small piece of what Synereo is all about. Read the white paper. Read the blogs. It is risk-free to do our due diligence. Personally, I'm very excited.

I am unable to withdraw mine either. It was in BTC long after the hack and then they recently moved it to the BTC_B which you mentioned. The BTC_B doesn't seem to be at the recognized value BTC is, so like you I too am stuck and concerned.

I just want my $13 back, Bter.com.

My observation: Yesterday at 2/14/2015 around 4:30 Central Standard Time, I logged on to BTER.com to manage my $26 USD in crypto which I have spread out between three to four currencies, including bitcoin. Well while logged on there was a very brief moment when the bitcoin from my balance "disappeared" and my account balance reflected the missing bitcoin. Well I panicked for a moment but then seconds later after doing a refresh, the bitcoins reappeared and everything seemed normal. I then exhaled and wrote the scare off as nothing more than a browser glitch that corrected itself.
After logging in today and reading about the theft, my experience now hardly feels like a coincidence. 
Bummed. It is only $26, but it was the only crypto I owned. I doubt I'll come back anytime soon. My heart goes out to anyone who had a sizable loss.
