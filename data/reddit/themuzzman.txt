You are not setting a custom fee.  Bitcoin transactions are basically free right now. But you are most likely using an exchange that is screwing you.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:06:38
If you paid a $14 fee then you are an idiot
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:07:06
The original poster is correct. You have not lost anything. You have the same amount of BTC that you had before the price dropped.   You can sell your BTC and try to get more dollars.  And then when BTC goes back up (and you don’t have any), you won’t lose anything either. Because you still have the same amount of dollars.

Relax. Just wait until the mem pool settles down. Maybe Sunday it will be in better shape. Until then, just enjoy the price rising.

The Gemini exchange is great. Was not down during the madness periods.  Winklevoss ironically built the best legit US exchange so far.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:19:21
Have you ever successfully pulled USD out of an exchange and specifically Coinbase?  That's the question.  I have not and feel like I'm getting jerked around. Especially when now they ask you "is this transfer going to another exchange" when you are withdrawing BTC. It's getting to lose the property of anonymity to some degree
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:33:18
1 Update.  I have logged into Gemini and I was able to withdraw BTC (Not Confirmed Tx Yet) but logging in did work.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:47:08
I don't know..... Would you be worried if your $$$$ showed they were supposed to be in your account and they aren't, with no way to contact an actual human being.  &lt;?&gt;&lt;?&gt;  I am 
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:43:53
It's just that if i says a date, then shows complete and you still don't have your money.  With no way to contact a human.  After multiple exchanges have already went down.... MULTIPLE ONES.  Then, I get a little paranoid.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:16:53
ACH is 2-4 days. Also says it on their site. Some ACH is actually next day also.  I initiated a Gemini withdrawal at the same time and I did receive that today.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:42:16
Yes, I have opened multiple tickets.  I don't even get an email back or a response.  Up until now the issue was always resolved and they eventually went through.  Just never did a cash withdrawal.  Has anyone else?  I don't know one person who has.
You are correct, I should be more patient but I have seen this movie before.  Just wanted to know if someone had a similar experience and can provide some insight.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:45:54
Same freaking bank account I have made deposits from.  Been a customer for years.  Everything is on the up and up, it's within my limits, my ID is verified, etc.  At least send me an email stating that everything is ok.  I can't even get Coinbase to email me back or anything.  Get a freaking chat feature.  WE PAY THESE PEOPLE HUGE FEESS!  It should be efficient.

They put lipstick on a pig once again. Blockchain.info continues to not be innovative. This is a Ledger with a new case and probably a bogus blockchain.info interface which probably doesn’t support Segwit. Stick with a Trezor if you want the best hardware device.

How are you importing for BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:19:29
Dude, I had a BTC paper wallet that was encrypted and I cannot load this into Electron or Bitcoin ABC client.  It will not allow me to click the sweep button in the wallet.  I am getting an error in the console of Bitcoin ABC.  I verified the BCash is still in my wallet using the block explorer.  Any ideas?  
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:52:41
Well...:  I think it's like $30 to do a wire transfer at my bank.  So depending on how much you are sending, I would say that Bitcoin is still crushing. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:28:50
Yes. Except. There are broken links on digibytes website and doesn't look like there is much of a community.  Where are the developers?  I believe Digi is great but needs developers and some marketing. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:36:35
I am trying to import a private key that no longer holds BTC but has a Bcash balance.  I have verified the balance using the BCash blockchain explorer.  Electron Cash will not let me click on the import button after I attempt to follow the instructions and I input my private key.  The button is just grayed out and will not let me hit enter and move to the next step. 
The Bitcoin ABC Client when I use the console is giving me a  Invalid private key encoding (code -5) error.  
I do not have an android phone so if Coinomi or another hot wallet is allowing for importing via QR code, etc.  I cannot use those and I am really confused why electron cash and Bitcoin ABC are not working for me.
I had all my BTC is paper wallets before the fork and I am testing this process so I can claim the BCash on my other wallets afterwards.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:09:02
I have decrypted it and have a new private key that starts with a 5 and it is claiming no inputs. No shoot and BCH.  But in block explorer for BCH the wallet address shows a balance. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:26:28
If you drop your wallet and lose it. It's also permanently gone and everything in it. Same concept.

@_date: 2017-08-05 20:45:33
Beyond frustrated.  I imported the BTC to a Blockchain.info wallet and now all I have is the BCC that I am trying to bring online.  I am still not having any luck with a decrypted BCC address.

Can you wait like 1 more day?

It's a working copy of the blockchain not dependent on the internet.  All the peeps who claim "what will you do with bitcoin if the internet goes down" can no longer make those claims with this satellite in place. Although if the ENTIRE internet goes down we have much bigger problem than bitcoin payments. Literally 90% of everything we use on a daily basis would at least temporarily cease to function. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:17:57
Please for the love of GOD, is there a way to easily import a paper wallet to claim BCash? I'll try the electron cash later if I absolutely have to. I installed it and it's not as easy as I would like. Please, is there an actual EASY guide to importing a BCash wallet so I can please dump this garbage before it trades at 25 cents? Any help would be appreciated and I can promise my funds will only go back into Bitcoin

You have to use bitaddress.org and decrypt the private key.  Then import that key into electron cash.  Use desktop version.

I have one. It’s the least profitable way to mine. It’s great to learn how to use cgminer or another mining program and also connect to a pool.  The process will give you some fundamentals about mining and it’s not a bad way to learn. But you will absolutely 100% lose money.

Running a node is good, everyone should.  Mining is a fun hobby, you should learn about it.  Also know where you are dedicating your has power.  Politically you should use slush pool if you actually support bitcoin, want it to succeed, believe in decentralization and aren't just about making a few extra dollars.  
If you really want to help bitcoin.  Let your voice be heard that wallets like Blockchain.Info and exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, etc have still not implemented Segwit.
Until we have the majority of the economic nodes and SPV wallets on board with segwit, we're going to be held back in terms # of transactions, higher fees and overall running on 1 cylinder instead of 4. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:44:02
As far as dynamic fee estimation goes, blockchain.info is the best. I am not recommending keeping large sums of money in their.  But their fees will generally always be the lowest.  
Green address is by far the best wallet but their estimate of the fees is not the best. To get a low fee you have to set a custom fee.  
You can also set a custom fee with blockchain.info

Bitcoin will survive on fees once there is no longer a “block reward” for the miners. Which will not happen until the year 2140. Every 4 years the reward is cut in half. Next will be in 2020 when it goes from 12.5 BTC to 6.25. Also with each block mined are fees.  The fees will eventually be far more than the block reward. Bitcoin mining will survive on fees. Unless there is a major proof of work change, etc.
Eventually you will just be able to use bitcoin like cash or credit cards. Not everyone will accept it but it will be much more accepted than it is today.  
It’s not that everyone will see it as a get rich quick scam. It’s just a more prudent form of money, store of value, etc.  So why not have some of your savings diversified in Bitcoin?  This is probably the way most merchants will view it.  
In my opinion.

With 100% Segwit adoption, that will take the blocks to 1.7 MB.  Once we hit that mark, it will be evaluated further. As of now the mempool looks great and unless you are using an exchange or crappy wallet you can get tx through for very little
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:40:38

@_date: 2017-09-28 12:50:42
The current structure of bitcoin will allow for a 4 meg block size.  It increases gradually and most wallets and exchanges have not even yet implemented segwit.  
By the way.... there are 500 tx in the mem pool and your transaction will be processed in the next block and probably for zero fees.  
So why are we even having a scaling debate?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:12:32
Of course they will not. Move them soon. You have a few hours.

Never send any BTC to a random address claiming to be a charitable cause
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:18:39
They’re all fine. I would recommend Trezor over ledger but anything is fine. Most importantly just control your private key. Write it on paper. Etch it on your belt buckle. And that’s all you really need. You don’t need a hardware wallet. You just need to write down the private key and you are fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:29:41
BCH will probably hyper-inflate away in value.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:29:24
It takes time. Segwit transactions are over 7% and climbing. A 1.3 mb block was mined the other day. This is a safer, smarter scaling solution.  If you want to roll the dice, join the BCash clan.

Well.  Yes and No.  Yes, offline wallets are the safest place to keep your bitcoin.  No, a cardinal rule of Bitcoin is never to keep ALL your Bitcoin in only one wallet. Spread it out over multiple addresses. Safer that way.  Would you keep ALL your money in one bank?  Maybe, if it wasn’t that much.  But you would be wiser to hedge your bets.  Anything can happen

canaan.io  Avalon 741, great miner.  Look it up
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:52:08
No segwit2x.  No core developers have endorsed it.  Know the difference of Segwit without the ridiculous 2x.  Support BIP148. It's the user activated soft fork not a miner endorsed segwit2x
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:46:59
It will be priced in dollars. You will just pay with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:14:29
You are the worst. I'm shocked. Ungrateful and dense. What Tone does with Tone is only up to Tone.  Whether he trades himself a own accounts or just provides insight has no bearing on the value and gratitude I have for his videos. Clearly analyzing markets, delivering news and doing technical analysis is a gift for the core of the community and he does it very well. The Dude clearly is smarter than you, definitely smarter than me and I am very appreciative of what he does.  If his insight does not help you, then don't watch his videos.
Just know, you are super bogus. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:36:43
Tone Vays is the man!!!  Love that Dude. Great analysis. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:31:04
I advice you to do more research. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:12:26
Moronic. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:43:38
Yes.  Private key also contains public key.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:06:43
no mainstream news.  should be the top story on every outlet.  when they finally do start reporting and it is on every news outlet, I would expect a pullback.  Honestly, I wish the price would dump about $400 right now.  Wipe the smiles off everyone's face and see how voraciously it is bought back up.  
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:20:03
Probably not a good idea, what goes around comes around. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:46:00
Do not purchase from Bitmain unless you support the evil empire.  Please do your homework.  Also Bitmain can actually turn off the miners they are selling.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:07:11
Boycot Birmain at any cost. Buy a competitor. Avalon 741 is currently a good buy if you can get your hands on one. Use nice hash or coinwarz websites to calculate your profitability. But at any cost, do not support Bitmain. Do your homework.  They are the villains in the BTC story up to this point. Don't support the dark side
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:44:51
Happy for you.  I really am.  Enjoy it while it lasts and I hope it lasts a while.  You should do some homework on all the cloud mining companies that pulled an exit scam.  I've seen this movie before.  
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:02:46
How did you pay?  They don't accept pay pal anymore and I am too scared to send them BTC
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:47:49
r/BTC is a joke. Is that for real?  Look at that?  Have they completely taken over the entire sub?  Is there anything legit about it?
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:23:48
r/BTC is for shills, trolls and people with an agenda.  It's not a true reflection of the community. It's for people who wish for changes in Bitcoin that will be BAD for 99% of users and GREAT for them. Ultimately it is a place to spread disinformation. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:23:25
Paper wallet and keep a backup on a thumb drive. Better than any fancy hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:18:10
Proof of stake is a joke.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:52:49
Coinbase is not going to exit scam. They're in bed with the regulators. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:23:56
Delanecey and Eldridge. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:32:04
Love seeing this. Means the price is going higher
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:10:12
Gemini is very reputable. Much better than coinbase and I have used them both quite extensively. Gemini has never been "down." They have lower limits (at least for me) but I have had a much, much, much better experience than with coinbase
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:24:24
They’re too busy solving real world problems and working on larger big picture projects of more importance......... like adding stellar lumens.  Hate this company and can’t wait until they are completely irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:45:22
Theory is that the bad actors stopped spamming.  At least for now. Maybe with the intentions of lessening the overall enthusiasm for the need of safely implementing Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:24:10
Bitcoin waits for no one 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:00:05
It's money. You don't have to "cash out". Why don't you just spend some instead. You can get a debit card depending on where you live. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:25:19
Ummmmm..... is this guy serious or just sent to spread propaganda?  Absolute trash and not surprised to see Forbes printing this fear pumping article lousy with disinformation. The good news is when you see these articles it usually means prices are moving higher. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:30:27
Very important point and piece of information. Please up vote this
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:42:01
I love seeing this. Usually means that prices are going higher. Once they start praising, we're in trouble. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:26:25
Cloud mining is a scam. One day it will blow up. Paying someone to mine bitcoins for you, in principal is not a wise idea.  You can do some "hobby mining" and should get a small rig for a few hundred bucks. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:02:35
Dude. You are a shill. Trying to spread propaganda.  Down vote this post 
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:39:58
R/BTC is for shills and trolls spreading propaganda 
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:35:25
There is nothing good about a hard fork. There is nothing safe about a hard fork. Nobody wants two bitcoins. Oh wait, you want two bitcoins. Making you a troll. Please down vote this propaganda post
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:11:15
I don't even understand this question
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:21:46
If you live in New York, there aren't any other options except Gemini 
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:21:36
LMAO. You are using Coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:53:37
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:22:03
It's hard enough explaining one bitcoin to people.  Can you imagine having to explain two bitcoins to people?  We are approaching the critical mass adoption.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:39:16
People have money. What is the shock?  
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:22:28
At the moment it is not permitted on Gemini.  I believe you can on Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:17:19
Do not support Bitmain or run their products. They are the evil empire. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:30:57
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:23:57
Gemini is way better and also way cheaper. Problem is that they don't accept credit or debit cards and their daily limits are capped at $500.  It's instantly available but still only $500 per day. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:55:40
There is a lot we can do.  First off, do your homework.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:26:51
Gemini. But there are lower limits for USD transfers in
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:18:31
It will be priced in dollars. You will just pay in BTC. You won't really care so much of the decimal places.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:43:44
It's Y2K all over again.
