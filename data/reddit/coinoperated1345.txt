That many BTC would need to be bought if that many were sold.  Just because one is mined doesn’t mean it is instantly sold.
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:20:38
More sellers than buyers 
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:51:04
No, I’m saying outsiders think it is going to $0.  If they thought it would be 100j then they would buy and not be outsiders.
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:29:17
You need to understand the big miners are not in the same position as the average person.  Many live where electricity is much cheaper.  Many cashed out enough to support the mining enterprise for years during last year's run up.  These people can afford to sell when it is convenient for them, not everyone else.
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:06:16

Not all miners need to sell instantly.  I bet most don’t.  That is not buying BTC, but even if it was it would be “buying” OTC and would not affect the price.
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:49:40
Out of BTC and into what?

“Store value better than gold” lol.  Bitcoin has utility although the things you mentioned could be done with pretty much any crypto, no need for BTC specifically.  Bitcoin has little utility comparatively is the point.
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:02:40
Hmm, you didn’t say how they don’t have utility.
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:20:12
Super whiny.  Bow down and kiss Buffet’s ring
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:20:04
I guess if you define utility as the ability to send to someone else quickly, then you got it.  Bitcoin has more utility.  I guess by that measure Nano (or pretty much any crypto) has more utility than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:23:35
It sounds kinda like you’re backpedaling that BTC will be around longer than USD.  This was about Bitcoin and now it’s magically about some unknown future crypto.

“Eventual move up”. Famous last words

I wouldn’t say stocks have much utility.  Ownership stake in a company.  A claim on a company’s assets and earnings.

People have figured out it's better to get out with a little rather than letting it go to $0.

Yes, if everyone held and never sold the price would go up.

@_date: 2018-12-07 01:36:09
I'm guessing at least $2500.  A lot of people are still way up and are unable to dump all at once.  Plus projects need money to run so they are cashing out to keep the doors open
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:39:52

@_date: 2018-12-11 18:49:59
They could be related.  Something similar.

If everyone bought, sure it would rise.  Pump and dumps generally make it rise.
