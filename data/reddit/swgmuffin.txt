Why so butthurt

Having a discussion is simply not trolling. I understand you have a strong opinion on the subject but I’m trying to discuss the underlying issues that are involved and covered up by the huge persona known as Alex Jones. 
I’m not assuming, they clearly list the reasons why but not the actual faults that are supposedly considered hate speech. All of these are private companies and I am not equating them to a government entity, but simply suggesting that his free speech has been blocked if not limited. These companies dominate the internet and are the main sources for any kind of platform. Censorship from each one of these platforms is essentially a limitation on free speech since there is no equivalent option to turn to. Considering this, it would be folly to say his free speech has not been suppressed in some kind of way.

It’s actually not, I just don’t use it in everyday life haha. I try to express myself as simply and articulately as I can. You can use all the fancy words you want but the fact you can’t answer my question  and haven’t explained shit proves it all.
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:19:44
Welp, whose next ?
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:22:22
This is either sarcasm or you’re serious. So I’ll try and answer both. Maybe he is a “nice guy” yet the public persona he portrays is one that lacks morals when faced with the opportunity to obtain large stacks of money.
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:36:01
Wow Vito, so cool!
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:10:54
Isn’t this more of a focus on silencing someone they don’t like vs actually banning people for going against their guidelines? I don’t mean to defend any of Jone’s points; I don’t even agree with  or listen to Alex Jones. Calling him “AJ” is weird to me and I am more so focusing on the infringement of free speech. He was not simply banned from YouTube but practically everything.
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:17:42
I see you’re breaking out the thesaurus and because you’re butthurt for no apparent reason lol. I wanted to understand what point of view you were coming from but I realize you’re just another moron troll.
