Use [this info for buying bitcoin]( it explains the steps in a simplified manner that your father, yourself, and any beginner will be able to easily understand. There are good tips for staying safe throughout the whole process. Do also read the section on choosing a wallet (online vs offline, cold vs hot wallets). 
As other commenters said, there's the bitcoin FAQ sticky - which always gets updated often. And there's the bitcoinbeginners subreddit for asking those seemingly "easy" questions. You'll find lots of experienced community members to help answer. 


Nicely said. Do take a good look at past price trends before investing. That being said, segwit is definitely going to add some much-needed stability and cruising speed for bitcoin.

you're welcome. Even though there are website recommendations, please be sure to research up independently when choosing an exchange, wallet, or any other service used while purchasing bitcoin. Remember to always take your coins off the exchange onto a wallet. It's the safest way.


yes, they do. and it is pricey. but hey - it's bitcoin. Banks transfer is what the long timers use though. Paypal to bitcoin exchanges do exist, but they're far too expensive. Only useful for buying small quantities of btc.

I love this feature for actually buying bitcoin through the dollar cost averaging investment strategy.. it's great
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:08:33
Good point there. The last time i explained to my office buddies how to buy bitcoin was in Nov 2013. It took them 4 weeks to follow my tips. You can only guess what happened straight after they purchased their BTC...

You're more than welcome. I hope it helps you find a suitable site that is easy-going on beginners. I know a lot of newcomers get scared off by the heavy verification processes that some sites require. Don't worry not all payment methods entail this (eg cash p2p purchases are worth looking into). Reach out to me if you have any other suggestions or questions.

Hi there, thanks for reaching out. Could you resend the PM with the info to be updated relating to CEX? Nothing received so far.  
@_date: 2016-09-19 18:34:19
Hey - cheers, i see what your saying - in reference to recent new I imagine? Since paxful is one of few sites to offer this service, perhaps users asking how to buy bitcoin with paypal might not mind about these allegations, so long as they can get some coins quickly. Maybe i'll place virvox or coinimal above paxful. Let's see how things evolve

It's true that privacy is pretty much guaranteed with this sort of bitcoin exchange. Moreover, coins are super safe and no need for counterparty risk storing them on a centralized exchange. Thanks for insisting on this point. I'm going to add an extra reference for users wanting to know how to buy bitcoin instantly / anonymously (using a secure p2p means at least) and users 'willing' to go that step further up the steep learning curve for the added trustworthiness of using a decentralized exchange. This could be interesting for tech-oriented users too.

Yeah it's true that circle is a good one to include for any guide on how to buy bitcoin with a credit card. I like the over user-friendliness and ease of access for newcomers. I do feel however that their front page lacks a reinforcing message that users can buy bitcoin on their site - sometimes it seems more to be a good wallet. Perhaps i should make this clear in the website description. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:29:00
Hey wow, thanks for that great feedback. Really appreciated. 
I'm going to review those sites one by one to see which could be useful in my list. I do believe that bitsquare, for example, might be slightly too advanced for new users (although I do think p2p exchanges is something everyone should learn to use, as this is the way forward). 
Point taken concerning Coinbase, I'm hearing this from multiple users. The reason for their inclusion was the ease of use for new comers. I guess this is overlooking other aspects such as the ones you mention. I'll take some time to review their positioning in my list. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:45:04
Great, and good job! I've updated the information regarding CEX.IO as requested. Thank you for reaching out :) 
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:51:44
I appreciate the advice! I've updated the wording in the two sections you referenced. I'm also going to get the whole thing re-read and edited for clarity. 


Good idea, I'm going to look into some nice graphics for this.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:36:50
Hey, thanks for your comment, which raises some really important questions that need answering an awareness for beginner bitcoiners.


Remember that these are people who have been in bitcoin since 2012 and before. People who say this have seen big exchanges and online wallet services get attacked (MtGox, Bitfinex, Cryptsy...). Of course there is no problem keeping your coins online, just don't keep more than you are prepared to loose. 
Coinbase insurance is great, but I'm not sure that alone will convince me to disregard precautions about using an online wallet. Banks also have a myriad of insurance schemes... but we all know that banks come and go (sometimes with depositors money too)

Great thanks, I've updated/modified the article based on your suggestions here too now. Credits to your username appears too (i can take it if you don't want it there?)! I appreciate that you took the time to actually read the article 
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:27:51
I've made a page for beginners searching how to buy bitcoin. It includes the most widely accessible sites that accept paypal, cards, and SEPA bank transfers. Cash options (eg using a bitcoin atm) are also listed:
My priority was to keep the page as simple as possible, while still trying to include incentives for users to dig further into the bitcoin universe and take an active interest in the surrounding technology and innovations. I'm actively looking for feedback, so please let me know if you have any suggestions.
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:43:29
I place reputation as overall feedback that the whole buying experience gets from customers. Yes, Localbitcoins has top-notch ethics and customer service. But some rare users, potentially new comers, have been robbed of their cash. I understand what you're saying about Coinbase having a good trust score, despite it's ongoing flagging and freezing of accounts. I should explain it better within the page, but Coinbase seems to target user accounts that buy bitcoins to then take part in "illicit" or non-regulated market places. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:31:14
Thanks for the positive comment. I would definitely like for the guide to be included in the sidebar. Is it possible to request this?
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:15:12


This is true, good point.


Ok thanks, I was not aware of this.


 
Excellent. This looks like a really safe alternative to meeting at actual person, but sill allows you to buy bitcoins with cash. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:37:57
yeah i think you're correct about this... it may lead to confusion. Perhaps i need to be more consistent about which (plural/singular) i use?
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:02:47
thank you for the feedback and the heads-up re the tables :) Good to know that it still works in landscape view. I've tried to optimize the tables as much as possible. It should normally be scroll-able on mobile (hold down on table and move finger to scroll)
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:02:28
Hey thanks for the suggestion. I can see why including info on the blocksize debate would be important, especially in recent times. But perhaps this would be slightly daunting &amp; maybe too far-fetched for beginners simply looking for good information on how to buy bitcoin. 
I do agree that a block-size debate &amp; introduction should be included in any guide to the bitcoin community, but perhaps not for guides on where and how to get btc
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:39:39
Hi this is really great. Thanks for your perspective and for taking the time to really read over things! It helps so much to get feedback from a knowledgeable user like yourself.
I do feel guilty for all the spelling mistakes though.
If you have time I would appreciate any insight and feedback on the other sections. 
EDIT: I've updated the article with each of your suggested improvements :)
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:04:18
That's now corrected :) thanks for reading in detail !
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:53:39
Thanks, will do! 
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:45:23
Great, I had no idea BitBay had a mobile wallet. Will look into this
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:00:46


I'm curious how bitcoin beginners will react to any possible split. Most likely they will follow the experts in this space. On that note, should I update my [beginner's guide]( with an overview &amp; explanation of the stakes behind Segwit, UASF etc?
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:33:46
Great, this is a super useful guide, it's nice to see it being updated regularly :)


I would like to suggest adding my guide to this section. It's a wiki for new users to understand how to buy bitcoin safely  and how to choose an appropriate wallet for their usage (ie long term storage vs everyday spending).

I have written up some reviews on the places to buy bitcoin:  for Kraken alternatives. Although I should say that Kraken is one of the most reputed places if you are trading with euros or dollars (and has high volumes)
