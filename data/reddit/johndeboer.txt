Just see this post today and hope you held on.
Looking at your main investments, at today's rate June vs today you lost approximately 15%. As BTC went up by 620% ish in the same period, you still have a huge cash profit even though less absolute QTY in BTC.
So in the end I hope you came out on top dollar value.
There are never ifs that work out. IF you would have put 600BTC in X.. you would have 1200% vs BTCs 620%. IF...

No crypto should be "regulated".
The exchanges.. now that is something different. Exchanges MUST be regulated to avoid millions of people being goxed.
If the G20 can just address that part frist. That would be great.
The day when exchanges will be subjected to mature oversight like Korea is starting is the day I open a bottle of champagne no matter where I am.
Today I am not convinced people can just cash out even if they wanted to and we just need a few stories of exchanges without enough liquidity to pay up to cripple what can be one of the best thing for the world since sliced bread.
(Yes I know, crypto is the fiat of the future so why cash out in the first place. I also say that but still)
Imagine the Winklevosses want to cash out tomorrow. Know any exchange that will let them retrieve such an amount?

Segwit transactions go through very FAST!
There is no need.

Annnnd yeah. Forgot about that one LOL.
So replace Winklevosses with someone else with a lot of coinage :)

Please share the math. 
Even though I can imagine the USD under hyperinflation, I would love to see how we will have 19 quadrillion in crypto.

Quite simple. Say you tried to increase the families wealth and it did not work out. Shit happens, you live.
I doubt that you bought in only yesterday right? So what is the real loss from entry to 0?

Fair enough, he is entitled to his opinion and he does know a lot about traditional investing.
Precious metals and paintings also have no rate of return but still they appreciate in value.
The rise of Crypto is a paradigm shift. New rules need to be invented for it.

Yeah. You know, I know but it does cause a sell off.
It's crap.
Bitfinex subpoenas were for the Tether hack of 30M and the Bitfinex operations under DDos.

New York times had a negative Tether story today. Forbes was negative yesterday and Bloomberg the day before.
