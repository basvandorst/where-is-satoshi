As somebody who left Italy and is currently living abroad (and tried different countries), I can tell you that the grass is always greener on the other side. There's a lot of bullshit in every country and you should treasure what you have and try to make it better (with the little you can do, I know it's hard). I tell you this even though I myself, as I said, left because I was fed up (and better opportunities abroad), so it's a bit hypocritical and I know it. No matter where you go, there's always something that stinks and politics is shit anywhere, for various reason (some similar, some very different).
I miss Italy, and honestly if I could have a job there I would consider moving back, and not just because of family and friends. Just my two cents.

It's not really about the actual value, it's about how fast it went there.
I do believe the value of bitcoins or cryptomarkets still has a looong way to go and is still very low, but relatively speaking the massive bull run we experienced since the end of november/beginning of december up to the christmas crash was way too extreme and unsustainable. They are two different types of statements.

I know very well what you're talking about, I lived it first hand for the first 23 years of my life in Italy. I moved to Amsterdam to study and I've seen it there as well. Things are slightly different, the infrastructure is different, but some things never change. Then I moved to Ireland and oh boy there are so many things wrong in Ireland that I notice and think "wtf, this would never work in Italy". The greatest example is health insurance. In Italy we are blessed with good infrastructure for health, surprisingly. Both in Netherlands and in Ireland I had to pay more than 100 eur/mo just to have some basic healthcare plan from private health insurance companies, America style (if not that bad). 
Lots of silly rules in Ireland (can't buy alcohol on weekends before 12pm from stores, for example), lots of weird and convoluted bureaucracy very similar to what you would see in Italy. I work with a team of about ~10 people, and I daily interact with people all over the world (hundreds of them) and to every person you ask, they would say the same shit happens in their home countries. I've had multiple conversations like "Yeah in Italy we are corrupted as fuck" and then have my Croatian coworker point out how much worse it is in Croatia. I don't think it's worse, honestly, I think it's very similar. We're all a little bit fucked by the higher ups and by shitty bureaucracy, unfortunately.
With this knowledge, I could honestly say I can count on one hand the number of countries I'd be willing to move to and consistently think "This is a great country to live in", and even then I'm sure I can be easily proven wrong by just... living.
We make do with the best we have :) Hang in there.

I agree with your idea in general but if you truly believe that as soon as we stop incentivizing people to work on things they aren't necessarily interested in, someone will magically appear that will take their place out of spontaneous will, then the idea is flawed.
Maybe there is somebody out there, or even a group of people, that might be interested in designing portable toilets, but either:
1) They might not even know they have such an interest unless they stumble upon it on the pretense that they need a job/money and
2) Most likely the volume of people who are interested in such a niche type of industry/work out of their free volition is much much smaller than the actual demand for such a position.
In an ideal world, it's nice to think that everyone will just do whatever they want to do, however due to the nature of humans and the fact that we can have more than one single interest, we aren't really prone to specializing into a single thing without external inputs to do so. There are so many things that are just cursorily 'interesting' that we wouldn't even give a single shit about if it wasn't for  the allure of money and a stable job, and most of them we can't really automate realistically-speaking. 
You're generally talking about some kind of Utopia that cannot exist, it's an ideal world that does not apply to the real world. Maybe some fundamentals do, but the actual application is flawed at the root so it's irrelevant to even consider it.

Imagine I buy 1 BTC now for 1000 dollars and it grows by 20% in two months. I now have 1200 dollars.
Now imagine I buy 1 BTC for 1000 dollars, bitcoin swings up 40%, I sell for 1400 dollars, then it falls back down to its original price, I now buy again 1.4 BTC with my 1400 dollars, then bitcoin rises up to 20% just like in scenario 1. I just made 1680 dollars vs the original 1200 dollars.

Have you ever owned a server? I can see on my raspberry pi running right now something like hundreds if not thousands of failed login attempts from Chinese IPs every day if not hour. And there's literally nothing running on my raspberry pi other than an SSH server and IRC.
Banks and big companies (or, rather, *everyone*) are constantly under spams and attack by random bots and hackers and whatnot trying to get in. Big targets like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc are also victims of targeted and specific attacks. 
There's literally nothing special about Coinbase that would differentiate it on that regard. Also, you can't get hacked if you store your private key/seed on cold storage.

I don't think it will ever be ready until you actually get pressure from a public that *wants* it.
There's no better pressure to finishing that LN, introducing ~~segway~~*segwit* to exchanges, buying those extra 4000 machines so coinbase stops crashing every fucking time the prices goes up 20%, than to have the eyes of the entire world on you waiting to see you either succeed or fail.
Sure, there will be everyday people who will try their luck (and fail) and put some money into bitcoin, some customer-friendly apps (like Revolut for example) have started offering easy ways to buy some bitcoins. You're bringing the word 'bitcoin' into everyday language. Maybe now some random person asking their butcher if they accept Bitcoin won't be seen as a crazy neckbeard anymore. Maybe that will push traders and store owners to start considering *actually* legitimizing bitcoin because they want in like everyone else. Starting from big stores like Amazon, maybe. 
Is the bitcoin infrastructure ready? Probably not. Does it have scaling issues? Yes. Are we working on that? Yes we are. 
Sure it'd be better to have all of this 'fixed' before we reach critical mass, but it can't be avoided now and we have to roll with it. Regardless of bitcoin succeeding or not on this sector, it can still be used as a store of value and add legitimacy to cryptocurrencies so we can have the next generation of crypto with better liquidity, lower fees, faster transactions actually become widely accepted as everyday payment.
Imagine a household having a bunch of bitcoins in their own wallet and with that they will be able to 'top up' their alt-coin wallet so they can make everyday purchases. It's not the ideal world, but it's miles better than what we currently have right now. I'll gladly take it.

Depends on the bank, unrelated to bitcoin. It's the same for any other platform where people sell/buy stuff and use bank/card payments. Should not be a surprise to end users.


No trading fees on gdax (coinbase) for maker orders.


This is the only fee that is affected by the bitcoin protocol, and if you are okay with keeping your coins on coinbase, you will never incur in that.

I also never pay a single fee to buy bitcoins from gdax, your point being? I'm not trying to say there are no fees, I'm just using the same logic as you, just because your merchant has deals with the banks, it doesn't mean that somewhere down the pipeline there are fees.

It *could* be a bubble, but I wouldn't call it *clearly* a bubble. Bitcoin started from nothing and it might very well still haven't reached its actual market value in the current state of economy. Bitcoin could be a transfer of wealth as people move out of assets like (for example) gold and instead prefer a more liquid and secure asset like Bitcoin where they are in control of their own funds and don't have to go through intermediaries.
With that in mind, it might look like a bubble since it's quickly spiraling out of control, but if you actually look at the property of bitcoin (where it becomes more valuable as more people are invested in it, the amount of people and amount of global reach), you can clearly see that this phenomenon is a one of a kind situation.
If the essence of 'gold' came out a year ago and suddenly the entire world realised how valuable it is, its price would exponentially increase in a very short time as demand rises, very similar to what is happening to bitcoin right now. Does it mean that the current price of gold is a bubble? No, it means that it is just adjusting it to the actual assumed value of the asset. 
This is my opinion of course, it's not fact and it could very well be a bubble. Be skeptical and invest only as much as you are willing too lose, just don't be too quick in calling it a bubble because you might be wrong.

Genuine question, I get how futures somehow work but I don't have all the details down so that would really help me here. I assume the resistance is the amount of people invested in bitcoin and the market cap which is harder to influence, but I really don't know.

You don't have to pay any fees to invest in coinbase, just get verified on gdax and then send a bank transfer (0 fees) to coinbase, transfer the money to gdax (0 fees), put a limit order (0 fees) and then transfer the bitcoin back to coinbase (if you want them there instead of gdax), again 0 fees.
Obviously a bank transfer takes time and should be planned ahead, but fees are the least of your problems if you use coinbase.

You literally proved why it's a bad idea to use Bitcoin as currency right now, unfortunately. If I spend now and bitcoin jumps 20% up, I lose money. If I save now and spend later and bitcoin drops 20% down, I also lose money.

This is not the fault of the bitcoin currency though. I mean, some of it is with the transaction fees but most of the time it's heavily dictated by the exchange you are using. 
Coinbase, for example, tries to take 'advantage' of 'normal' non-savy users that decide to trade directly on coinbase, while also offering one of the cheapest ways to buy bitcoins on the market with basically 0 fees through gdax.
I put a SEPA payment to a coinbase euro wallet, 0 transaction fees, I move that money to gdax, 0 transaction fees, I add a maker (not taker) order on gdax and buy bitcoins, 0 transaction fees, I transfer the bitcoin back to my coinbase wallet, 0 transaction fees.
There are some minimal fees to transfer the bitcoin from coinbase to an external/non-coinbase wallet, but for everything else it's literally free. Furthermore, if you want to cash out your bitcoin into euro, you only have to pay 15 cents flat rate on any external bank payments, not even a % rate. Can't get cheaper than that.

I'm not a expert but as far as I understand it, trading on futures lets you easily short the money, which means you can have an invested interest in seeing the price of bitcoin go down for personal gains. This in turn means that people might be speculating on the value of bitcoin crashing.
Realistically, I think you'll see a stabilization of the price which will lower volatility as the market becomes more mature with real investors both shorting and longing futures, creating more strength in the market.
Again, I'm not an economist and I know very little about how this works beyond an amateur level, so please correct me if I'm wrong and don't take whatever I say as fact.

Watch  (it's stickied on the front page of this subreddit).
$5 month is okay. $50 month and you're already cutting off the lower end type of people who don't have the hardware or resources to spend into that. $500 a month? Now you only have smaller companies and maybe richer individuals... $5000 a month? Only the larger companies now feel it worth it to run these nodes, maybe some medium-sized business owners. $50,000 a month? Well...
Increasing block size is not a solution. Sure, it can help and I'm not entirely against it but it needs to be considered really well and it's definitely something that can't be done forever in the long run. Maybe 10MB blocks are acceptable, but by compromising with that you are simply making it easier in the future to further increase block size and decrease decentralization as you make it more expensive for people to run nodes hence weaken the whole bitcoin network mesh.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:46:08
Because you don't have to use said hubs. If you are doing day-to-day transactions for a few dollars each you probably don't want to wait hours or pay crazy tx fees, but you also probably don't mind if your payment goes through a second layer. (At least it's not worse than it is now)
If you are worried about centralized banks holding control of these hubs and stealing your tens or hundreds of bitcoins, however, you can always go outside of this second layer and still work normally in a fully decentralized way.
Just because there's a higher tier of aggregation, also, it doesn't mean that it's centralized. Simply adding a new layer makes it easier to group up more smaller transactions together instead of spamming the blockchain every time you want to buy a snickers bar at the 7/11 across the street.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:26:27


It's not a linear increase. This is what people don't seem to understand. Every time you increase the block size, you increase the weigh of the network to *all* peers. It does not scale. Yes, you can increase it 'a little', but that ends up snowballing *hard* and it does more harm than it's worth it in the long run.

I would like to go with the (maybe extremely) optimistic view of 2-3 years for the more underdeveloped markets and unstable currencies. Look at Venezuela, look at Zimbabwe. There are a lot of emerging markets as well that would benefit greatly from using bitcoin (or some other crypto) as liquid money.
As says in his comment, it will be harder for economies like Europe or the US with strong currencies like the USD and EUR so that will definitely take longer to become mainstream. On the other hand, we've seen bitcoin become extremely popular and widely accepted (at least according to the reports) in Japan which has  also a fairly strong market.
This is all provided we can get over the scaling issues, which is a *massive* problem and not just about bitcoins but crypto in general.

I don't know and I honestly don't want to give any advice or spread any FUD either way. The thing I can recommend the most is to do your own research on the matter.
I think there are two different things that you have to consider and evaluate.
First, it's the technological side of the situation. Which technology do you think is more sound? Which technology do you think follows the most competent implementation? Which technology is grounded on a good and fundamental base, has a good development team, is backed by people who know what they are doing and have a track record to show that, etc? [*]
The other thing to consider is the financial side. Which currency has the most money invested in it? Do you think it will last? How many people are entering or exiting the markets? How big is the volume? Does it scale? Is it a speculative currency? Are people just trying to get rich quick (are you?) or are they long-term investing into it? On this side, honestly, I always recommend two things: 
- **Never** buy more than what you can afford to lose. Don't gamble, consider the money you put in it as money you don't own anymore, because they very well might be gone tomorrow or in a month and to you it should not matter. If you can improve your funds and grow your interest, that's great! But on the other hand, you shouldn't rely on it. And...
- **Always** diversify your investment. This means don't go all in on BTC or BCH or whatever other crypto currency out there. Don't buy into the fad or with your emotions. If you diversify your investments by buying a bit of everything (at different percentages), it will be much harder to sink your funds once one of those currencies crashes and you'll be much safer.
Ninja Edit: [*] Keep in mind that historically, the strongest technology is not always the victor. See: Betamax vs VHS.

I did some digging with my parents to see what they knew about bitcoins. I asked my dad 'If I told you the word bitcoin, what do you know about it?'
He instantly went in full defensive mode with 'It's that fake scam internet money that people use to buy weapons and drugs online. It's the one where the creator got caught trafficking humans and got arrested because of it'.
I burst out laughing and then I had a nice ~1 hour conversation with them, explaining what they actually are, how they work (in layman's terms), how they can be profitable, what are the risks, etc.
By the end of the conversation he was still very skeptical (mostly worried about me investing money in something he thought could be a scam) but the following day he told me he did some further digging on his own and wasn't as opposed to it as he used to be. Still dubious though.
If we want to win the race to cryptocurrencies, we need to win over the common folks, not just the rich investors.

They are super cheap, I got some at my local grocery store for some ridiculously low price like 100 for 1 euro. No need to mess around with a tea infuser and you can still enjoy high quality loose-leaf tea in bags just like the ones you'd buy at the store.
It was a huge life improvement for me as I hate tea infusers and washing all that stuff every time I want just a cup of tea. Fill your tea bag with a spoonful or two, throw it in your cup, and you're done. Throw it away afterwards :)

I joined Bitcoin late (not the currency, the subreddit communities), so I don't know all the political intricacies and historical reasons that brought the split of r/btc, however from what I can see right now:
* r/Bitcoin is the sub where you discuss anything related to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The technologies, the memes, the financial side, etc. This is the currency that is recognized with the 'BTC' ticker.
* r/btc is the sub where you discuss anything that is 'broadly related' to 'Bitcoin'. What 'Bitcoin' is, for some people, is a very subjective and opinionated matter. Right now, r/btc is focusing mostly on Bitcoin cash. It used to have a lot of discussion about Bitcoin Gold and B2X, however now it's mostly pushing for Bitcoin cash. There are some topics about the Segwit Bitcoin (Aka 'BTC') but in general they want to believe that Bitcoin Cash should actually be the 'true BTC'
* There is *a lot* of bad blood between the two subs because of political reasons and because it's much easier to be split into an 'us vs them' kind of mentality these days so be careful in how you approach these topics on either sub, you will see very differing opinions as both sides live in their own echo chamber (somewhat) and can give you **very** opinionated responses. 
I wrote [this]( some time ago with what I feel are the differences in the behaviour of the two communities. I think it gives a nice impartial overview on what to expect in either sub. 
Who is in the right and who is in the wrong? Personally, I think this sub is more in the right than the other, although I still lurk and occasionally participate in both. I like to make my own opinions on things and to be skeptical in anything I read. It's very easy to fall into the rabbit hole of conspiracies **on either side** of the argument, so remember to always be inquisitive and balanced when consuming all the media around this diatribe.
These are just my 2 satoshis on the situation currently unfolding. I hope it's useful to somebody out there.

The way I see it, both subs are guilty of heavy partisanship and focusing a lot on the 'other' side rather than working towards making their own side stronger and more legitimate. The striking difference to me is, however, the different approaches of the two communities. This sub is way more moderated and curated in a way that the obvious trolls, haters, concern trolls, shitposters and in general shill accounts don't even get an entry and are removed (however that gives a lot of space to shitty memes and annoying posts imo), whereas on the other sub there's very little apparent moderation and in turn I've seen a lot of batshit crazy conspiracy theories come from them, a lot of hate, a lot of call for brigading (although I've seen some on here as well, unfortunately), a lot of shitflinging everywhere. 
Both subs can be technical on their own end and discuss the advantages of their own side, however it gets really hard to dig into the actual merits when there is a huge chunk of the community (and this applies to both) that is more focused on hating rather than building.

Basically Internet communities 101. 
People want to belong, they are irrational and heavily partisan. You see it in politics, you see it in sports, you see it in videogames, you see it on twitter... and you see it in here as well.
It's basically this: 
I've seen good arguments come off people at r/btc, but I've also seen good arguments come out of people on r/bitcoin. I've seen intense shilling and manipulation, lots of brigading, lots of fishy-looking downvotes/upvotes on weird posts, on both subs. Personally I think r/btc is more vicious and more vitriolic than r/bitcoin but probably that's because they are *feeling* the attack and that they are on the losing end, r/bitcoin would probably be the same if the situation was reversed.
It is a very dangerous situation to be in, there are a lot of immature (and most likely underage or newly-of-age) posters who are easily swayed one side or the other. They want to feel like they belong and want to be acknowledged by the community so they go all out and are prone to believe whatever fits their narrative. Keep in mind **I've seen this happen in BOTH subs**.
Be critical, folks. Don't discredit every argument you see just because of who it's coming from or where it's posted at. Use your brain and make up your own opinion, you don't have to agree with everything and also you don't have to disagree with everything. We all make up our individual identities and the biggest contribution you, as an individual, can make is to actively create and foster a constructive environment by not giving in to hate and partisanship when something controversial comes up.
Both sides can be wrong and both sides can be right, just on different matters.
Personally, I feel like bigger blocks would help in the short run but also they cannot scale and are a dangerous slippery slope. I don't disagree with the vision of some r/btc posters and I would like BTC to be a more liquid currency, but at the same time I don't think BCH is 'the true bitcoin' or that it should become so.
Just my 2 satoshis on the matter, I've been involved in chaotic Internet communities since the 90s, I've seen this happen so many times over and over again. It, too, shall pass.

Are you, like, completely unaware of the entire history of bitcoin or what? This crash is nothing lol

This is covered by the second part of my post:


If this is the case, there was no point in stating that bitcoin is grossly overvalued in the context of this thread. We're discussing the price variation and trends, not the relationship that has to do with one's own perceived value of bitcoin.

1 btc is worth exactly 1 btc. I don't understand why it's so hard. Right now we are in a transitioning period where we use fiat and compare it to fiat, but the properties of bitcoin (or cryptocurrencies in general, I'm not claiming btc will be the long-lasting one) are much more than that. Adoption keeps increasing and one day you won't have to be worried about its perceived value in fiat, because you won't need to.

Why did you not exit at $9k? Why not at $10k? Why not at $13k? If you think it *still* is grossly overvalued, then I don't understand why you didn't sell back then when it was this very same price.
The only explanation I can come up with is that you can still see that you can make money out of overvalued goods hence you decided to play the market. If this is the case, then I will ask, what is the point of your original post in relation to this thread?

I can totally see me do something like:
"Oh wait, I think I had some bitcoins back then... 3 of them? Let's go check"
"oh shit it's actually just 0.0004, it's just small change, not worth it..."
Then after news of BTC as it keeps going higher and higher, I start having doubts and wonder if maybe my money disappeared somehow and I was right that I had 3 btc after all... so I investigate and end up asking around on reddit.
I mean, it's totally plausible, this comes from somebody (myself) who had 0.02btc mined in 2011 and I just forgot about them and couldn't be bothered to recover them. I only started getting back into btc a few weeks ago and finally decided to recover my few old bitcoins.

Technically the ISS isn't in space, they are still in low earth orbit which is within the atmosphere. Not sure if you knew but I just wanted to post it in case more people TIL.

Governments won't have to care. They can look at your spendings (which can be reported and enforced, as they depend on your transactions with retailers) and they can look at your earnings (your salary, which can be reported by your employer, mandated by law). If it turns out there's plausible reason that you're purchasing way above your market, then they can demand you pay taxes on that. They don't have to prove shit, you will have to be the one to prove where you got the money, how you got them, and how much money you have to convince them you don't need to be taxed at that tier.
All in all, the government gets to decide.

You do realize you aren't forced to buy a whole bitcoin, right? You should be looking at the % increase and not at the actual number, depending on how much you invest, if you want to speculate.

Not 100% sure about GDAX but it is owned by Coinbase, and Coinbase said they will not support bitcoin gold until later depending on whether or not it catches on.
So yeah, I wouldn't trust GDAX if you want to deal with bitcoin gold asap.

And you would've sold it by the time btc reached ~$800 and started dropping in 2013, if not even earlier. It's really pointless to think about that, since hindsight is 20/20.

I mean, it can happen. It happened to me a few weeks ago ( and that's how I got back into bitcoins.
I had it in the back of my mind since, but I never bothered to recover them. 3 PCs and almost 7 years later and I finally found some time. God bless backups. It's only 0.02, but still nice :)

If you are a US citizen, you don't stop paying taxes to the USA if you go live somewhere else. That's how wonderful the US tax system is :)
But I'm not American nor a lawyer so I don't know the specifics, you definitely want to look this up yourself and seek counsel from a professional if you are worried you might get in trouble. Don't trust reddit randoms.

I know, I didn't mean to imply otherwise.
