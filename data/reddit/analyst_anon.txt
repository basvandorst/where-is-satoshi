Banks are bank is a terrible mentality. I realise it is tongue-in-cheek, but this type of mentality is why people continue to do ineffective or inefficient things. *It's always been this way! Can't change it now and I have no power to do so, so I'll just make light of it.* It's almost fatalistic. 
Cool thing about open free internet is now we *can* change it. And we all have at least the possibility of being exposed to other, possibly better ideas. Here's to optimism about the future :)

Yeah. If you didn't already understand how it worked, this explanation probably wouldn't have helped.

I know we're supposed to hate on fiat and traditional financial institutions and all on this sub, but if you're wondering why your credit score moves like that, it might be because your available credit changes every month. If it's exactly 760 and 780, you might have a recurring payment that changes your available credit that's slightly out of sync with when the report is calculated. One month the payment is there, the next it's paid off at calculation time. Then it repeats.
Or you might be on a very fine decision boundary with chaotic output, so it might actually be randomly changing.

From my understanding, unless they gave the keys to someone, yes, those coins would be out of circulation. How many coins depends on which half dies, though, because they're not evenly distributed across addresses, some individuals have more than one address, etc.
There's no protocol to reclaim coins at inactive addresses.

I don't see paper money going away within the next few decades.  It'll probably become more and more inconvenient, leading to social pressure to switch "just for the sake of convenience", but it won't be eliminated. At least I hope not because my time capsule is basically just crisp $5s waiting to be dug up in 30 years.
