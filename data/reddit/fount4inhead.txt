You can just remove the blocksize let miners set their own softlimits and technology can act as the natural blocksize limit. Allowing bitcoin to operate at its technological capacity if required.

There is no their fork, most on rbtc are up for any proposal that scales on chain. The only reason 2mb was proposed is because everyone is so pathetically conservative.  He's right about the 2mb it would just create the same issue again.

by paying $6 in miner fees to have it sent to your wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:00:48
the theft itself only amounts to a tiny percent of bitcoin supply certainly not 20% the drop is related to fear around the saftey of holding bitcoins in general especially on exchanges. This is not however fundamental to bitcoin as is somthing like the limited blockspace so yes I would say this is an artificial low based purely on fear.

@_date: 2016-08-14 20:31:14
Layer 2 is going to happen anyway as a natural consequence of the free market it is no excuse for not developing layer 1. 
Far more value can be had through many transactions of smaller fees than a handful at larger fees, not to mention the clear benefits of the former.
If the vast majority of transaction happen off chain eventually the security of the network will fall behind the value of the coin. Because the majority of profits for the use of bitcoin will be going towards private companys rather than miners.

Sweep it to prevent someone else stealing it then try to contact the person if possible to return it, if its not possible then keep it. 
Just like if see someone drop money on the street, no its not right to just keep it if you know you can give it back to them, but if you cant its just money on the street with no possible connection to someone else then yes its yours.
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:10:37
It's not so much about security on a personal level but more on a business level. Every time I think of a business idea for bitcoin the question always arises how would you secure the bitcoin from theft? Especially from employees.  
So yea people are worried to leave money on exchanges. Didn't bitsquare make a decentralised exchange? 
Arguing people need to keep their money offline in cold storage is just face palm to me. That just means bitcoin ultimately doesn't work as a currency for the masses and something else will need to take over. 
No, people need to be able to trust leaving their bitcoin with other institutions to at least the same degree as fiat.

@_date: 2016-08-13 16:58:11
Inability to scale. How can you get excited about something that cannot become an alternative currency? That was the primary excitement for most people that it could start matching national currencys, it cannot in its current state and people seem to want to keep it there therefore we have to move on to other coins.
I would much rather people chose to scale bitcoin than to use some other coin.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:51:05
Cards and NFC and the banking system in general are all just third party applications of whatever fiat you happen to be using, meaning that exactly the same usability security insurance etc can also be applied to bitcoin eventually. Maybe all the major wallet provides can get together and start producing the foundation of this system. In the meantime there is no way, you could get one of these debit cards that exchanges your bitcoin balance each transaction but that's still the banking system. With bitcoin capacity reached you certainly can't use bitcoin as means of casual payment it is utterly inefficient and unreliable I wouldn't use it myself as a bitcoin advocate let alone recommend it to some else as a form of payment. Unfortunately bitcoin is only useful for large or trusted payments in its current handicapped form.

The coinbase app is not a good user experience, layout is bizarre, but most importantly it doesnt tell the receiver that a payment is pending confirmation, this is an absolute must for any bitcoin wallet otherwise the user simply has no idea whats going on for upto hours nows thanks to core devs.

I do not mind paying for a service. The issue here is the notification is poor if not non existent in the process of making the transaction on your website. I believe there was an option for low medium or high fee this does not imply a pay as you go fee this would be read by most users as a miner fee. 
There should be a confirmation once you execute the transaction with the details of it along with all fees which you then agree and send. 
Some small print somewhere is not good enough, it simply wasn't clear, I know in my own mind I never agreed to this and so there was no contract, and thats my issue. 
I dont care for a refund but I would like the process to be more transparent in the future. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:49:32
Ok so although you still control the private keys they could still potentially steal all your bitcoins with any single transaction if you do it through their app or website...
Not exactly encouraging. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:36:21
Maybe they do but I never agreed to pay as you go, but even so how were they able to take the money? these are supposed to be private wallets they have no control over.

Why ignore the fact that bitcoin can't be a currency in its current state because people have followed cores roadmap? Promoting it as a form of payment is a waste of time. If you want to do anything for bitcoin at this point in time you need to support scaling.

If bitcoin doesn't scale then of course it's market cap will fall.
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:33:52
Why is that a problem isn't that how it's intended to work? So at a later date when a majority are running bu miners can then chose to increase blocksize and it will be accepted.

@_date: 2016-06-08 06:41:37
The problem is additional administration costs for accepting bitcoin payments if you have check confirmation and cancel previous orders. If there was no block size limit this would not be happening not to mention we would have more adoption and a higher price.
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:58:47
 na I dont think so.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:46:28
No doubt there is something written in fine print, which is rather deceptive considering the process is identical to every other transaction before it without a fee.
There should be an obvious confirmation to pay the fee, but regardless of that now, how was they able to extract the fee? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:01:57
Phase 3 can only likely happen through third-party layers, agreements without the blocksize increase.

@_date: 2017-01-17 07:53:23
There's a high potential for the opposite to happen namely that if you're strategy is to operate at a loss for years in order to bankrupt competition that's only possible by racking up debt.

Whats responsible about raising blocklimit with a hardfork that will only need another hardfork again when limit is reached? Whats responsible about delaying the increase in capacity which is damaging user adoption for the last year or more?
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:40:20
There will be no third fork it takes a huge amount of support for a fork to survive, bitcoin cash had that a fork of segwit to 2x wont even be close not to mention it will not happen anyway. Selling BCH is not good advice imo, ive been buying since fork because its superior to segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:43:35
Wouldn't make sense to, bitcoin has lost its function as a currency since it hasn't increased its blocksize, other ALTs can though.

@_date: 2017-08-01 21:23:47
Those fireworks are of no concern anymore to the other camp thats the point, its an issue only for segwitters now.
@_date: 2016-11-29 11:41:04
It was not spam, and considering the network becomes useless for a vast amount of small value transactions then why would you expect it to sustain? Of course not you simply give up and would most likely not want to return, or are you going to continue trying to pay for that item 3 days later or maybe make more transactions ? no you are going to quit doing that because if the network does not scale then it does not allow these transactions in the future. Mind you Bitcoin has no future as a settlement later either.
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:52:59
Mass adoption? As someone pointed out the other day bitcoins current capacity can't even reach that of a single busy supermarket store if considered on a per item basis.

@_date: 2016-12-29 07:59:50
This used to be true but bitcoin no longer works as a currency like it once did because of course rising fee's. Most ALTs can act as currencys bitcoin cannot. It is simply an investment vehicle now so no you will always have to sell it if you want to spend it on a day to day basis unless we see blocksize increases.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:19:37

@_date: 2016-12-02 07:47:29
It's a bit of a catch 22 because people think we'll price is up so forget the blocksize. But bitcoin is designed for the price to go up and I'm convinced without the block limit the price would be double if not more.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:08:01
The state doesn't have a monopoly on printing money it's a borrower like everyone else, certain private entity's have the monopoly.
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:59:53
The government issues bonds it doesn't print money. The central bank is a private entity owned by member institutions namely commercial banks but not soley commercial banks. This is not a conspiracy theory its textbook, its right there in the encyclopedia. When money is borrowed it is created new by the bank on deposit of an IOU, the process is identical when you borrow by issuing an IOU to the bank or a government borrows by issuing a bond(IOU) to the bank.
Food for your thought, if the government is issuing its own money why is it charging interest to itself and creating a national debt?

It's doesn't increase cost because you equally increase volume of fees for miners as blocks grow. As there is no cap you won't need to do anything in a few years miners compete in an open market meaning the lowest possible fee will always be found on the Bitcoin cash network. This s free market mechanism cannot happen on segwit coin because if a miner is willing to process more transactions as he has the hardware and capabilities to do so he cannot because there is an artificial cap in place that prevents him.
@_date: 2016-09-27 09:07:00
Damage is already being done, as many predicted you will not get super high fees instead transactions will plateau and users will migrate to other coins, this is exactly what is happening, solutions are already provided, BU being the best,  if it's not going be done with urgency soon then get into other coins because bitcoin is capped and value comes from users.

The problem is if scaling is only happening this way and the blocksize is not being increased then you have more and more value being transferred on these other layers with less and less value securing the network meaning you are reaching a point where the network is no longer secure and open to attack because its more and more financially viable to do so.

Thank God cores small block agenda will soon put an end to this.

Does anyone know if this was another single entity bearwhale that triggered this?
@_date: 2016-05-28 07:34:55
I got an email saying the claim amount was rejected but its actually accepted on the spreadsheet, is this email some sort of scam?

The government doesnt need a credit check to borrow money, so it can indeed borrow what it doesn't earn and this is what collapses the currency as its borrowing accelerates to pay previous interest.
@_date: 2016-05-19 17:54:31
All that needs to happen is the blocksize removed and Bitcoin could be on its merry way, but thats not going to happen now, Bitcoin WILL be replaced by another coin its just a matter of time. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 10:31:44
Its all very well but I introduced a friend to Bitcoin the other day set him up with a wallet and sent him some bitcoin took about 5 hours to receive with no feedback from the wallet that the transaction had even been sent and was stuck in a mempool waiting confirmation. They literally laughed at the idea of this being used as a currency and I had to agree. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 15:28:54
Cant stand this ridiculous line of thinking, not worth even rebutting it anymore. If miners dont want to do anything about it then maybe its simply impossible to hardfork Bitcoin at this point in which case another coin will takeover.
@_date: 2016-10-30 23:44:05
provide some substance then, how does the network secure itself when it has no block reward left and the majority of transactions are happening off chain? 
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:08:18
Whilst simultaneously blocking any customers doing banking with bitcoin company's.
@_date: 2016-05-30 11:16:49
Love coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:25:49
Fundamentally change the way every bitcoin transaction happens with segwit, are people crazy? Just remove the blocksize as intended by Satoshi. KISS.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:06:30
Because he added it as an early spam measure nothing more. Without you can just allow the free market to operate at its full capacity, if technical limits are hit then its the technical limits that act as the blocksize limit anyway! not that that would even happen.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:12:35
Yeah, the same amount of people that can bully segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:56:24
Still the same reasons, instant send, private, dao. Ln Network is not secure and neither is segwit. It will likely spike Bitcoin short term but long term it will boost alts even more.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:39:19
Its implied.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:59:11
It will probably price around 100-200 and then slowly gain marketshare overtime.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:38:31
P2p lending does bypass fractional reserve lending. So I encourage people to use p2p savings and borrowing rather than traditional banks. Because it essentially works how people expect banks to work, people deposit and others borrow those deposit at interest. But the key point is money lent is money deposited not money created.

"I love buying mortgages at huge discounts, in fact it gives me a thrill" 
Presidential material here.
@_date: 2016-05-28 07:46:15
is the wording "all or a part of the amounts that you filed were rejected" because it might be just a fraction was rejected.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:40:43
In fractional reserve banking new money is created based on the reserve the bank has so no this couldn't be done with bitcoin. Read the federal reserves doc 'modern money mechanic's'
@_date: 2016-07-19 09:01:21
Hes right.
People here seem to think some magical dust will just make Bitcoin remain number one once it hits capacity. Bitcoin is fucked once it hits capacity it will simply slowly die as it gradually gets replaced by alts overtime.
This is already happening with the value of alts going up far more in comparison with bitcoin in the last year.
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:16:20
Thought you guys love fees?
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:52:31
You may never see transactions rise now, fees are too high adoption has stopped and alt coin values are beating bitcoin daily. So this is already the result of the transaction cap.  
There couldn't be a more clear signal that both price and adoption has stalled in alignment with capacity being reached.
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:37:44
Maybe you can provide some substance of these new developments in bitcoin that are in place now that weren't in 2014? 
If you are referring to lighting network and segwit dont bother.
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:20:12
Your just shooting the messenger, you think coinbase want to ask this or give a shit about where you are sending your money? It's just extra admin for them. If you have a problem with it go to your government tell your representative you don't like the overarching regulations. Or just whine like an idiot to a single company that's having to follow the regulations YOUR government is putting on them.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:42:32
If Bitcoin does not scale it will not be worth shit in the future end of story.
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:49:51
They are banned.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:48:26
Banks need to be regulated for this especially under anti trust anti competitive laws of which in most cases ironically they are not subject. 
We need to move from representative democracy to direct democracy utilising technology so people can propose and vote directly on issues.
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:42:29
The networks at capacity it's not going much higher than what it's at maybe 800 if lucky.
@_date: 2016-07-08 09:15:40
must be true.
