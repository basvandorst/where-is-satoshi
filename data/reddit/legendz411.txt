Well, firstly it is assumed that someone FORGED these checks. So this company may not be at fault at all.
That being said, obviously they didn't follow the rules outlined there, nor did my GF's mom know anything about any of those steps so...

[SRS] for a moment, where's the legal team?
HOW is this not highly illegal?
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:42:30
Thats because the process wasn't undertaken.
I think you misunderstand. My initial complaint was that someone with the organization has used their checks to fraud someone. I have now found out the checks were forged and am in contact with someone who can help, (hopefully).

They have too after TD doing this.
But yea, LOL on shipping. It is unfortunate.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:01:03
Yea, dumbass gave the info to him. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:22:59
No idea yet. Trying to get ahold of the proper people who can verify or discredit this. 
The checks look legit from this company, but I know they are easily forged. 
Like I said, trying to get ahold of someone who is IN the company that can yes/no this kinda stuff. 
Im on with Wells Fargo now, the bank they use.

I am still dealing with the fallout so bare with me.
From what I understand it was a basic Western Union money scam.
Got routing/checking from girlfriends mom, deposited fraudulent checks then had mom trans funds... Yall know how it goes from here.

Sweet god.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:51:11
As far as I can tell, this was a standard Western Union money scam using forged checks. The company i thought may have been involved, Cashintocoins, seems to not have any idea wtf is up.
I am talking to the owner now and have deleted this post, (i hope) in an effort to avoid slandering someones good name.

Im not worried to much cuz the money is all there and everything. Im just curious as to why the link displays a different transaction. :P

I feel bad because all these people are str8 up going to LOSE their money and spin it like this is bitcoin's fault. It isn't the fault of a random currency. 
A fool and their money are soon parted

GG they lose
No one who uses countercurrency will ID themselves with all the alternatives
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:32:38
Ok well I got verification then.
Bank of America has verified the checks were forged. So now I suppose I will be getting in contact to let this company know someone is dropping fraudulent checks with their name on them.
Should I delete this or what? Not trying to smear this company - was just doing headsup
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:50:28
Holy shit I dont know anything about what your talking about - but I will. Thank you for my friday wiki material!
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:21:19
I wonder what happened to that notion...
It seems more and more that it is heading towards a 'universal currency' than anything else.

Jesus. A word of reason all the way at the bottom. God speed sir

Did you just go to school for regular CS and then programming or? How do people end up writing software for utility like this... Is there some staffing agency that puts up software needs and you apply or? 
Genuine question here!
