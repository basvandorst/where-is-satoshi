I am sorry if I'm rude but the app has very dismal ratings at Play store(Android) compared to others and breadwallet on ios. Many people have rated it lower due to the fact that they have lost their money. Why isn't the app as good as on the ios? Why the android app has less attention from you guys?

They have launched a "Clean India" initiative and under it making the country Open Defecation Free(ODF) is one of the biggest priorities and challenges. They are building toilets and giving subsidies to the poors who can't afford to build it.

Lol i too thought of mining once with my GPU but wasn't sure so dropped the plan.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:43:30
First three steps happened with me and I'm ashamed of it!��
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:51:44
Wow you were still very early. I bought this year. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:19:27
That's the spirit.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:16:22
Woaahh that's some steal deal. Lucky you. Congrats. :) Right now I'm just in BTC and XRP, will go in alts now. Couldn't buy ETH as the trustworthy exchange in my country has not been taking up anymore signups from quite a while. They have lots of pending KYCs to clear.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:10:11
I wouldn't say negative, there are a few people who are negative about it. Instead what i think is that govt is pretty positive as it supports their "Digital India" initiative and for that reason they asked the views of citizens on VCs.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:07:05
Yes, but hardly matters, he is equally qualified. :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:21:32
So its pretty clear now that he wants to eat his dick.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:55:06
Don't wait now then get a li'l something for yourself which you can afford. :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:31:42
"Cyber currency"? Woah hold it there my friend you sound like some retarded and overdramatic news channel.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:57:23
I'm sorry to intrude but what is the electrum's BCH redeeming process? Can you explain or direct me to the right path? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:04:35
Trust me they really are.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:53:15
Wow. How much did you mine? Do you remember?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:49:55
Well i heard about it in around 2013-14 and bought this year. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:52:49
Yes that's the best part about it or else i would have been sitting ducks cursing and loathing myself. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:42:58
Hopefully lets see. A few months back major Indian exchanges made a foundation and now are also helping and suggesting govt in decision making.
Edit:- Also you should read the article which i just mentioned in parent comment. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:00:06
Yes, the previous government(Congress and its allies) which has ruled for around 60 years in 70 years of independence were pretty incapable and corrupt. Modi is changing things now. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:05:45
I don't think this will happen. On the contrary a few weeks back, a report came claiming that it is highly likely that BTC and other VCs will soon be given legal status. Also citizens were asked about their opinions on VCs and most of us replied positively. A very few people(idiots) desperately want it to be banned or declared illegal, so i won't be surprised if this is a fake news just to demoralise users. There have been no official statements regarding any of these till now.
Those idiots are publishing this  too so I'm not worried. Read it and have a laugh. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:07:35
Electrum works great for me. You can also check out breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:11:58
They already did take. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:11:38
Well the fear of missing the train and understanding the importance of the underlying technology.
 I first heard about it in around 2013-14. I didn't dig deep, just saw and thought yeah its cool stuff, lets see if this works out or not. Then in 2015 i saw that the price has now shot up and I can't afford even one bitcoin as I used to spend all my pocket money on not-so-important things and saved a negligible amount. I also thought, I will buy when i could afford atleast 1BTC. Then came 2016, I went lil deep and was impressed with the tech. Meanwhile life took a different turn, a lot of things happened and everything started settled down in around Nov-Dec. Since then i kept a constant watch on its price waiting for dip and also procrastinating a lil (yeah i know dumb. Right?) finally got a lil this year. From 2016 Nov-Dec i kept my Mom in loop about the prices and I didn't convince anyone in my family or friends. I bought a lil from the money which was mine cuz I know the prices are volatile and if i went on convincing i would have been even more late to the party. Also the difference between USD and INR also played a big role in delaying.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:27:40
I will not suggest contacting right away, wait till the given date. Good Luck.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:48:24
Well thats nice to hear. Hoping to see breadwallet reach sky high. It has almost all the features which anyone would want. Secure, Private and Easy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:30:23
Yes its accessible. Thanks for suggestion. Was thinking the same. Also what are your views about Kraken?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:54:44
Wait right now. Don't rush in. Wait for tomorrow or atleast few more hours. Things might go crazy. Good Luck! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:47:41
Ah! We all have been there. Now Zebpay has released their statement so it won't spiral down much.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:07:22
It is illegal 'tender' which is altogether a different thing.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:11:18
The site whose screenshot you just shared is the mother of peddling manipulated shit and fake news along with its sister sites.
They just said that they won't recognize it as a 'legal tender' meaning that purchasing goods and services from it will be illegal.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:21
My friend, that's a pretty generic and illogical reply.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:03:40
Lol, you're mistaken, my friend. Indian journos, as usual, are jumping the guns.
This is the original statement “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or a part of the payment system.”
This basically means that you won't be able to buy any goods or services exchanging cryptos as it's not a 'legal tender' meanwhile you can keep trading them on exchanges.
My guess:- They will probably treat it as a commodity/asset and tax the gains from it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:43:21
Who can have any problem if I would want to exchange something(which is not a currency) with anyone else for something else(which is also not a currency)! Eg:- Exchanging my comic book with my friend's. 
Why would govt have any problem with it? In your case yes, you can exchange car with goats but that doesn't mean the government should declare 'Car' or 'Goat' as a "legal tender" and instead of using currency people should use goats or cars to buy anything &amp; everything.

and it has not govt. endorsing.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:06:33
Yeah it is. I've been keeping a close watch on Indian govt. and RBI(Indian Central Bank ) from months. Sometimes it seems there is some conflict between both the parties. Also in July, SEBI(Securities and Exchange Board of India) and RBI were divided on whether to consider BTC as a security or currency. Lets wait and watch how everything turns out. Interesting times ahead.

Completely true.

I watched the budget session live. Don't worry they aren't going to stop trading. Indian journos as usual are jumping the guns.

Wait when did India bash BTC 3+4 hours ago?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:39:37
Lol who said google is banned from India? Maybe you thought China??
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:35:15
Haha this was Gold!
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:37:57
Thanks for links. Well it was reported bit late by world media and others. It was reported first on Sept 13th.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:54:26
most probably they will treat it as a commodity and tax the gains from it.

Lol, how is he corrupt if he is telling the truth? Let me jog down your memory. Here is the speech with the complete breakdown. 
Moreover, Here is a fact(old one):- Bill Gates can donate US$15 to everyone on earth but still be left with US$5 million for his pocket money.
Scenario:- Bill Gates repeats the above fact in some speech or interview.
Now if you interpret it as Bill Gates promises to give 15USD to everyone or he should give 15USD to everyone then you should get some help.

Ah. Great. I panicked as well as got excited after reading $400. Thought it was today. lol. :(
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:10:34
Maybe, but people shouldn't have jumped to conclusions by lies peddled by media, the statement by FM during the budget was pretty clear. Weak hands lost their money as they were affected by FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:05:12
Wow, should've bought more.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:59:44
Where? When?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:06:32
Most probably yes.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:47:57
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:43:14
Thank You. I was li'l sceptical due to its low ratings on play store but now I'm gonna try it. :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:15:25
Coinsecure later said that they will support BCH if it becomes popular
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:36:02
Thanks for the detailed reply. Appreciate it. I'm new out here so can you suggest maybe another not-so-controversial wallet on android? My laptop died yesterday so can't use Electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:03:20
Hey you can also get a lot of help at r/bitcoinbeginners
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:17:40
How about breadwallet or mycelium? Any thoughts on that?
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:54:25
Thanks for the heads up, I was just going to register.
