it's a crapshoot so the best chance anyone has is only 50/50. I know a few people who had 2400s and AP's and extracurriculars who didn't get in.

Yeah basically. The good news though is that with you're stats you'll most likely get into at least one top engineering school, so you'll be fine. Make sure to visit every school and try and stay there for the weekend too really see what its like.

And to anyone who disagrees, I am curious as to how many riots/big protests have occurred as a result. (not saying that I have done anything).

Wouldn't you need a central organization to proclaim that the price of bitcoin would be based on the cost to mine it? 
Right now the price of bitcoin is dictated by how much money people are willing to spend for bitcoins and for how much money people are willing to bitcoins. 
The whole system is based on the fact that no one can set the price. Taking your suggestion would require a central authority to do it.

You will know whence the time is right.
On a serious note though some smart man made it possible for you to say the magic lines (e.i +5 dollars verify) and for this too happen. Basically if you have a bitcoin wallet associated with your account, and that wallet has at least 5 dollars, the bot somehow transfers the funds from your wallet to the wallet of the recipient's account. If the recipient does not have an account, a wallet is created for them.
