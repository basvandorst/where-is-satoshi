I hope someone is working on new blockchain technology. Everyone having every transaction works, and it will work for a while longer, but I don't think it will work forever.
It will probably naturally sort itself out though. The bitcoin blockchain may eventually get more expensive to use, so an array of cheaper satellite blockchains could be created. Satellite to satellite blockchain transactions would be settled against the main bitcoin blockchain through some kind of periodic batch transfer. It would probably be like the banking system we have where there is both reserve currency and local currency.

The price is going from being primarily speculative to a primarily commerce-driven price.
The high prices we saw were valued correctly, but they were looking too far in the future to what it will be as opposed to what it is today and there was too much uncertainty between now and then for it to stay stable.
Once real demand from commerce begins picking up, the price will definitely increase again, but until then, it will drop to whatever the real demand *today* is.
Of course, if we have another cyprus-like event, the price will increase due to people protecting their assets from seizure.

Physical currency is only 3% of the money supply. Most of the other money is created by banks making loans. The loan contract combined with the creditworthiness of the borrower ensures that the dollar has value. Because he must go out and retrieve dollars from the economy to pay back his loan. So basically our money is backed by debt, like most modern monies. 
What makes us unique though is that our federal government has so much debt, because, due to the bretton woods agreement, our money can be treated as primary reserves by foreign central banks. So in order or another country's economy to have money, their central bank needs our money which it then loans to it's internal private banking system, which then multiplies it by the debt of it's people.
So you can see how everything is interlocked, and dependent on these private banks acting responsibly. If simultaneously they all chose to cut down on the number of loans the give, there would be deflation and people would be defaulting on their loans, their collateral would be auctioned....while the banks sit on tons of cash to buy stuff! Then they all give out loans and they could theoretically cause inflation and deflation cycles for the benefit of those in the club.
TLDR: our money is backed by debt through a complex system that relies on private banks. Bitcoin neither has it's benefits *nor it's liabilities*

Ancient Egypt had a dual money system. One was wheat, which anyone could produce, and which had a limited shelf life. It was used to buy any household things like food, clothes, tools, etc. The other was gold and silver, which of course was based on scarcity. It was used for traveling, buying land, and other high-powered purchases.
I think this dual money system is the optimal system. It allows money to be created and expand as needed, while still allowing a place to store and transport wealth. It shows both a masculine and feminine aspect to money. One allows for raising a family, providing for needs, and living life, the other allows for accumulation of wealth, conquests, and long term investments. Both are needed to advance civilization.

It can be a measurement unit for debt which determine which people serve or are slaves to which other people. Which nations serve other nations. Who produces, who consumes.

They couldn't buy very many before the price exploded because they were buying up the supply of coins for sale. So the company could do this to a limited extent, but I don't see it being possible to get more than a few percent of the coins unless they had much more than a billion dollars. The best way to get the coins would be for government crackdown like making them illegal to own, then the insiders buy them cheaply, then it is legalized again. Like they did with gold. Or like what was done with silver with it being demonetized. It takes government intervention for something like gold or silver or bitcoin to be bought up at low prices.

**TL,DR**: Bitcoin technology won't turn out to be big a competing currency, but rather it will splinter off into money that any sufficiently large sponsor (governments, corporations) can create based on their credit and goods and services they offer. Like creating a youtube channel, any venture can create it's own acmecoin which is used exclusively to buy from and get paid in, the gdp of the government or corporation gives it value. This is decentralized value-based money, as opposed to centralized debt-based money. Note this is a discussion about money as opposed to currency which is what we discuss bitcoin as today.

Ok, so basically the key idea here is that, *before* any transaction occurs at all, paypal could sell a contract to provide x number of bitcoins at y price. Then when customers come in for business, paypal has already locked in a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price, so if the markets plummet there is no risk. 
So as long as there is a good stream of people using the paypal service, paypal could sell these futures contracts for bitcoins in bundles either as they come in or shortly before they come in. This is a lot better than bundling up bitcoins after they receive them and selling them later on the exchanges for a good price because there's less risk. They can predict their daily bitcoin usage better than they can predict daily bitcoin price.

Changing multiple times might not be a bad thing. You don't want it to seem like what you're buying isn't worth much and in the toilet, so you have to buy thousands of them.

I don't have a dedicated machine, I only use livecds, and use it on whatever machine I need to.
I understand bitcoin, an address and key are pretty easy to understand. I don't understand electrum.

A significant frustration I've had is trying to use wallets with an ubuntu livecd. All of the wallets are either too big, or in the case of electrum, the installation commands don't work.
Then you have the issue of the wallet file saving in the /home directory in a hidden file. When you don't use linux much it's not so easy to navigate to that file and copy it over to a flash drive.
So installing it on a livecd, finding the wallet file and backing it up took me much longer than it should have.
Sure some people have created custom distros with the tools and everything pre-installed, but those can't be used for obvious reasons.
I never plan on having a dedicated installation for my wallet because that just seems dumb. I'll have to securely back up the system anyways because I don't want a hard drive crash to cause me to lose everything. I can't put it in a virtual machine because of keylogging issues. Sure I could make an encrypted dual-boot system, but again, I'll have to back it up anyways. And do I truly know it's all encrypted right and I didn't screw something up? Can malware recognize it's dual-boot and install a keylogging bios then later decrypt the installation and grab the wallet?
I just want an easy way to download a standard livecd image, use a script that sets up everything that I understand and can trust, and easily and reliably get my wallet file on a flash drive.
I don't care for a flashy interface. I'd much rather actually know exactly what's going on, know for sure what I'm installing, how it gets installed, where all the files are, and just in general exactly how everything is working.
Right now, trying to use bitcoin on an older laptop is very difficult and frustrating. The original client is too big and resource intensive, multibit requires java, armory has a serious issue right now, blockchain wallets are really sketchy with questionable stuff people have brought up, and the installation commands for electrum didn't work because pip wasn't installing.
It would also be nice if there was a self-contained equivalent of an exe for a linux livecd that could also be saved on a usb drive so that the package manager doesn't have to be trusted every single time to not be compromised as well. Either that or instructions on how to make a custom bootable livecd without relying on others to make one because they can't be trusted. These are the kind of issues that should be thought about.
It's hard to recommend people to use bitcoin when I can barely use it.

I think these questions are really easy to answer. Mobile phones will cover the large majority of the population. Economic usage will drive adoption even more. Not to mention, why can't gold and silver can be used in conjunction with bitcoin? It will simply force people to make larger transactions equal to 1 oz or 1/10th oz and be a little bit of a hassle, but it's a valid solution.
Regarding the second question, bitcoin requires nothing except the continued existence of the internet. Any collapse that takes us to a pre-internet era is unthinkable.
The larger issue that I see for it replacing global currencies is it's purely deflationary nature. There needs to be a second type of crypto currency that is different which can be used for wages and basic needs, whereas bitcoin is more of a store of wealth than a great currency due to it's deflationary nature.

Right now exchanges are vulnerable due to their bank accounts being closed. Bank accounts are needed to get fiat into and out of the exchanges.
Bitcoin ATMs would allow cash to be directly transferred to btc and allow btc to be directly transferred into cash. That means bank accounts are no longer necessary, at least in the traditional sense. To withdraw you just cash out your btc directly.
To put money into an exchange, the ATM's operator would need to work directly with the exchange. I don't believe the ATM operator would necessarily need to be a full-blown bank. No loans would be made, no wire transfers, no checking or savings accounts, and perhaps not even true customer accounts. They would simply need to get customer funds credited properly on an exchange. No customer withdraws to worry about.
By removing the bank equation, exchanges become much less vulnerable.

If I can anonymously get a credit card number, add funds to it, then program it onto the card with my phone, then it's a lot more like cash except it's got fees. If all card numbers are assigned to your company and you are resonsible for repayment (not a problem since the btc makes them prepaid cards), then you shouldn't need to collect personal information from people using them.

We should petition apmex to look into using bitcoin. I posted a request here:

Mine are transferred out of bitfloor (not even in the hold state), but I don't see them anywhere yet on the blockchain. 
edit: it took 1 hr 40 minutes to show up in the blockchain, but it did eventually

You have to wonder, if they are going so far out of the way to actively seek out people to press charges against bitcoin-24, if the goal is to take them down and get some criminal charges going. You know, play hardball. Maybe this isn't what's going on, but I'm always skeptical when they start swooping in, shutting down accounts, looking for people to press charges, etc.
If bitcoin-24 wasn't a legitimate operation it would have collapsed on it's own without the need to shut down their bank account. There would be multiple reports of stolen money, the forums would be aware of it, people would stop using them and they'd start pressing charges on their own.

None of this applies if people don't have good random number generators or if they don't have any entropy in their system. Like booting a live image off of a usb stick then immediately creating an address.
