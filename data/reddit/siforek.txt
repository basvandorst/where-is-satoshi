I'm talking about those that simply envy the top %ers &amp; don't do anything to try to be there themselves. Bitcoin blowing up may help a lot of people but the top % already have more than we do so it's relative. A lambo is one of the last things a person smart with $ would buy, usually lotto winners it's the 1st thing &amp; then they don't have gas $ to fill it lol.

Dude I was agreeing with you.

It's easy for people that have never done anything or even tried to shout up at the people who have. The top 1% consists of anyone making over $400k/year, most of which are not evil cronies, most of which gave you your job or sacrificed so much to create the company that did. People need to be realistic. Have some gratitude &amp; most importantly stop being so obviously jealous. If you wanna be rich in America &amp; are willing to sacrifice there is no one holding you back but yourself.

Not self absorption just a fact that of the many things used to control us debt is the big one. As an observer I'm sure you've heard not to put all your eggs in 1 basket &amp; that if you were dealing with millions you'd take far more care than he did.

Being your own bank means that you &amp; you alone are responsible for it. The benefits of that sole responsibility far outweigh the risks which IF understood are near negligible. 
I have no where near millions in crypto BUT even I have many backups &amp; failsafe in place to prevent things like this. The value may fluctuate &amp; fake news may take it's toll for a while but as long as the internet exists so will "my bank" :) 
I highly suggest anyone buy even $20 of crypto even just to learn it because the masses really have no clue what it is &amp; will be 5-10 years from now ;)

No. Improperly using it did. It's his fault not the network's. I mean who SERIOUSLY has millions in crypto &amp; doesn't have like 20 backups?? 
If you improperly use a chainsaw &amp; lose your leg is it the manufacturer's fault you didn't read the big ass warning sticker? No.. Personal responsibility people..

I will. If btc went to $0 I will have only made 6 times my money. That would suck ;)

What do you mean? The Federal Reserve is a slave master &amp; USD is only going to get worse. The thousands of shit coins are going away. Sure people have been taken advantage of but they're learning &amp; things are progressing. Crypto us still very new &amp; those that have been taken advantage of are in many cases the same people jumping on every get rich quick scheme. The people that expect things to work perfectly even for those that don't understand it are the same people that think Bitcoin at 6k is the end. It's going to take time &amp; I'm in it for the long run. There is a risk but I'm willing to take it &amp; thus far in the last 2 years I've been mining/investing I've made very good returns. In fact even now I'm still making 5x any other investment I could make.

This is 1 of the biggest mistakes people make when evaluating Bitcoin. I won't likely see the last BTC mined(unless I can pay for life extension with my BTC) but as time goes on less &amp; less will be created. Scarcity can have a HUGE influence on value, just ask all the people saying "tulips this, btc that". With only 4 million BTC left to be mined we will soon see the value increase just because of that. Imagine how hard it'll be to get 1 BTC in 10-20 years ;)

It doesn't because I'm debt free &amp; if I want something I work hard to save for it like a non brainwashed adult. 
As for the guy who lost his $ I wouldn't be surprised if it was totally made up.
Funny how 99% of the negative comments about crypto come from those with 0 experience with it ;)

I use charcoal on my cave wall :)

99% of fiat is just ones &amp; zeros.. USD is backed by nothing but a promise from a corrupt institution, Bitcoin on the other hand is backed by the LARGEST &amp; most powerful computer network in the world :)

It would be a lot easier to see your point if I weren't making several thousand dollars a month in crypto. Until that's no longer the case I'll stay aboard &amp; watch for icebergs, thanks:)
