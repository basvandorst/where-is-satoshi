But when that $500 debt increases to $32,000 I can't say I'd blame them.

Good money would be something that can reasonably hold its value from one day, month, or year, to the next. That's not to say it doesn't change, but it's not volatile to the extent that it can lose 70% of its value over a few years. It also needs to be easy to hold, save, and exchange. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:48:36
Essentially, yes, although I'd omit the absurdism.
Currencies can be bad currencies. The Weiner mark, bolivar, and bitcoin would be good examples.
And congratulations for you, but that still proves my point about how much of a bad currency it is. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:36:56
It's the most worthless of the phallic currencies 
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:24:39
Because it's current overhyped image deserves to be shit on. It's not a grand conspiracy, it's an asset collapsing in value because there is no value underpinning it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:19:13
I'm not saying it doesn't have utility, but the sentiment that it'll always be valuable because of that utility is incorrect. It can't be treated like, say, a precious metal. There are many cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin's value in particular is driven entirely by speculation, and the technology is still young and will be subject to regulatory restraints.
Its value is far from certain. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:26:42
This same principle also applies to conventional financial products, which people will still be more likely to use. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:57:56
Granted I'm not familiar with how to actually use crypto but I'm a bit skeptical about whether crypto really is that simple to use. In any case, that sounds a lot like PayPal, or any number of start ups.
And opening a bank account or financial service, at least in the UK, is nothing like that. All of my accounts are online and app-based and can send anyone money in less than a minute. I honest can't remember the last time I had to visit a branch.
I don't mean this to be another crypto vs. conventional point, but I don't think ease of accessibility is a selling point that will specifically benefit crypto more than established services. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:00:51
Well one perspective would be that a finite quantity of a currency is actually very harmful to an economy because it doesn't allow for any flexibility.
In any case, you may be right. I can easily see crypto being a viable alternative or complement to government-backed money, but bitcoin, in the bubble and mentality it currently exists in, is not part of that future. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:40:51
No it isn't. It's the instability of a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:33:18
You're not helping your argument.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:05:40
Get a basic grasp of finance. Every bubble in history was preceded by cocky speculators. This is no different. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:08:56
Bitcoin has absolutely no value in its own right. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:14:13
I'm not sure your financial history is up to scratch. Care to elaborate?
You know it's possible to be enthusiastic about cryptocurrency without buying into the Bitcoin hype. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:09:14
Who said it'll burst on two months? It could go on for a while.
It's still a grossly inflated product whose value is fueled entirely by people expecting it to rise in value. One day it'll be too much and it'll crash. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:31:54
I'll remain skeptical of that until it happens I'm afraid. Crypto has not yet demonstrated that it can be an actual currency to replace printed money. Its not stable enough to become a means of exchange at the moment, and they aren't quite as decentralised as they are on paper. 
Whilst there are downsides to fiat, it still works, especially in trusted (Western) governments, and comes with its own advantages. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:23:03
No one is treating conventional currency as a religion.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:40:16
All trade happens online at rates much faster than Bitcoin. That's silly. Supply and demand is a very narrow aspect if Bitcoin's price that only works to amplify market euphoria. It's not skyrocketed in value simply because there aren't enough coins. It's skyrocketed because people expect it to be worth more tomorrow than it is today.
Honestly, I'm yet to be convinced about the horrors of centralised money, but yes, crypto and the block chain in particular have very exciting applications. The fact that governments can print money to excess doesn't mean they are, in much the same way you can want your house with fire without burning it down. In Western countries I don't see this as a real threat (don't really care to debate this to be honest as this is essentially the deciding line between actual crypto enthusiasts); in any case, we had fixed(ish) currencies back when we had the gold standard. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:25:30
And I think it's reasonable to think that the market has priced it way too high. The fact that it dropped by $10,000 supports that. It may well turn out that Bitcoin will stabilise at a higher price, but I personally doubt it.
Currently, it's in no way a currency. Effective currencies need stability, otherwise they're just assets. Retailers can't accept it as a currency because it could just lose value erratically. 
As long as Bitcoin's value is being driven by speculators and the hodl crowd then it's value is not grounded in any real utility. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:20:12
By all means, show me a community who blindly praises USD, or tells you to 'hodl' Eur, or who is generally rabid against anyone who dares to not share the view that Bitcoin isn't the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:38:28
I dislike Bitcoin because I see it hurting a lot of people. I'm utterly unconvinced that its market valuation reflects its intrinsic value, and that's accepting the advantages of cryptocurrency in general. I firmly believe its current price is entirely ruled by speculation and that people are only buying it because they expect someone to pay even more for it in the short term. That's a fools' game that ultimately makes way more losers than it does winners, especially with the stories of people buying coins on credit.
That, and I'm also salty at having to settle for a 1060 at almost twice MSRP. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:47:46
People who frequent casinos generally know the odds are against them.
On the other hand, Bitcoin is likely to be a an overvalued asset riding a wave of mania. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:27:32
Let's not exaggerate what I'm doing here. I'm not rabidly anti-Bitcoin. I find it fascinating and still like to follow where it's going, which is why I follow it.
This isn't me being preachy. This was just a genuine response to a question, not an attempt to change people's minds. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:52:17
Because such complacency hasn't followed literally every bubble ever.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:13:39
Almost. I don't dislike it just because people might lose money. As you said, people have a responsibility to themselves.
I dislike the bubble around it. Its value is driven by speculation which makes people reckless and irrational. It has a pretty toxic community that champions it as a stable investment and a future currency, of which it is neither.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:08:43
I'm not doubting that. I just doubt it's current valuation is reflective of its actual value.
