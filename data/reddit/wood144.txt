They also need to get a better proofreader.  I saw two errors in their compensation plan powerpoint video.

Shameless r/bitmarket plug

It's not completely unheard of in the capital equipment market, though that is usually for systems in the 6-7 figure range and the terms are typically half down some percentage upon completion and the balance after a final install/customer sign off. 
On a 20K system from a small company I can't see putting more than maybe a 25% deposit down since it is a long lead item (even if they hadn't had delays.)

I think he means that they removed 14 so when they put it back the donation counter went up by an extra 14 since it only counts inbound money, not outbound withdrawals.  It didn't actually double the BTC

I'm still not 100% clear on when/where this fee is taken.  Say if I buy something on Tiger direct, I won't know exactly which coins my wallet will send and if the transaction will cause a fee.  Do I always just send .0001 more than the total bill when I pay, or does the vendor include the fee in the price and just get overpaid if the transaction is free?

Yeah I do quite a bit of international shipping for my job and have been chewed out by both my own bosses and customers due to delays in customs that I have no control over.  It sucks but you gotta just apologize and keep working on it til it finally gets through.  And then apologize even more.
