But if the cows get scarce like because of climate exchange? how should you pay even one back then if the value increases that much.

so how are kids in poor countries, where education is still not for free, then supposed to pay there colleagues fees? 
or if you would always have to save money first to build a home ...when would you be able to without a loan? with 50? 
but well I guess at least in the financial sector you could use ICOs instead of loans to fund small business as well.

but MarkerDai like USDT is still linked to fiat.
And I dont want fiat anymore in a crypto world^^
But well, maybe if everyone would use crypto it could get to a totally stable point. Even though I still cant get my head around that.
Also a coin with a set inflation like 5% might be not too bad to fix this problem. But otherwise no one would like to hold such a coin...

how does it solve it? negative interest to compete with deflation will just result in the person giving the loan to not give it at all. Since hodling will give more value and bitcoin ;)

ok :-/
well I thought we could find a solution without fiat

but the problem remains. Why would the lender give me 1BTC, if I would give him only 0,999999BTC in a year or so.
Even if 0,1BTC would be as much worth as the initial 1 BTC

Hey guys,
Can somebody explain to me how it should be possible to take loans in bitcoin if its value will always keep increasing due to its scarcity? I mean what would be the point for anyone to give me a loan of 5 bitcoin to build a house, if i cant give him back more bitcoin in a few years time?
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:35:51
but how? why would they loan me 5 BTC that are worth 50k Dollar and in 5 years want only 0,1BTC back which are then 60k dollar? They could just have kept the BTC then
