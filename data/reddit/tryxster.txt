All the chat was irrelevant to the topic, as if you're diverting the conversation and trying to de-legitimise those concerned as racists. That is a huge red flag. Plus your constant patriotic brown nosing.
If you PM me, I'll pay you twice as much as they are paying you to stop posting.

Not the best publicity.

If Bitcoin weren't right wing, people wouldn't be celebrating him endorsing it. A quick google would have given the answer anyway. He is under criminal investigation for receiving bribes and making a deal with a newspaper by agreeing to subsidise it for positive coverage.
Seems to be a detailed article about it here:

You read like you're paid to write propaganda throughout this thread.

I forgot that Bitcoin is right wing. When we think of him, we think of a corrupt Zionist that is prolonging the suffering caused by the Palestine/Isreal crisis.

It's an ad absurdum argument to show the ridiculousness of the original statement. Inside trading is unethical and there's a reason why it's illegal. Regulation is there because some humans can't be trusted to not fuck others over if they get a chance.

I very well do know about what they do. Hence why I said they cause atrocities and that civilian attacks are despicable. I think you should re-read my comment and realise that "Kurds" and "PKK" are different, I'm suggesting defence of the Kurdish movement, not the PKK.  I don't really understand this reply, it's in total disregard and irrelevant to what I said and is clearly emotionally driven over any rational argument.

While civilian attacks are despicable, it's not as clear-sided as you're making it out to be. Kurds have been persecuted for a long time by Turkey especially. But Turkey simply has the established power not to be called a terrorist organisation. A lot of Kurds want independence from Turkey and any other potentially oppressive regimes.
Taking a side simply due to a terrorist label isn't always the right thing to do. Always take into account that labelling can be a tool for established organisations to try and invalidate otherwise valid (and often progressive) movements for their own selfish survival regardless of the continued suffering it causes.
I personally sit on the fence with this one but I feel you've come down too hard on the kurds when a only a small group of them have caused atrocities. The rest should still have a right to strive for independence in a just manner.

I think the numbers they're playing with are so big that it's more likely to win the lottery than get a successful hash significantly earlier that predicted. With a perfect coin, imagine having to toss half a million heads to get a hash. So you expect to have to toss it one million times. It'd be unthinkable to be able to get it in 750000 tosses and that's just a quarter of the time faster.
Ftr this is a guess

They want to take control of the mining! They want a business owning and supplying the centralised &amp; controlled currency!

If you think that's propaganda you're delusional. Step back and look at reality.

As long as it's transparent. They are otherwise exploiting others' resources.

I didn't realise you lived in a feudal Britain.

How would anyone be able to know that?

Because it's irrefutably criminal to benefit from the supports of society without paying your due. Charities in no way can ever, and would ever, support such an infrastructure that taxes do. Unless you call a government a charity in the first place as it's not for self-profit, but is there for the profit and benefit of others. Or at least it should aim to be in a system with low corruption.

If you want to put your faith in a politician, maybe go a little further afield and choose one that isn't a racist, lying mobster. Or one that you can actually be proud of. Or one that actually does support blockchain tech. I hear his son is really good with computers?

?? That's a bit absurd. They are clearly there. I.e. transparent. Plus standard ads are generally accepted not to be exploitation of site visitors on the internet.

Taxation is the fundemental of a healthy and compassionate society.
