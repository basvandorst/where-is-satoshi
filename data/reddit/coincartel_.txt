3D printing will end the majority of small business manufacturing plants. This is because a good 3D printer will continue to decrease in price over time, increasing widespread mass adoption. Middle men come in all shapes and sizes, not just 12x12x12. Think bigger.

The idea prevails.

Bitcoin cuts out the middlemen for processing payments. 
3D printing cuts out the middlemen because if you own a 3D printer, you can manufacture your own products, and sell them directly to your customers by accepting Bitcoin, not needing a manufacturer, and not needing visa or MasterCard or 3rd party payment processor.

Because the media likes to be muckrakers and spread negativity. We will succeed. We will spread awareness. Godspeed brother.

I'm not going to debate or argue with you. The exponential rate at which 3D printing is growing leads to one fact:3D printing will destroy manufacturing, and create tremendous job losses in the manufacturing industry, as well as disrupt the supply chain of businesses as well and therefore jobs. We can bet on it, or we can come back to our discussion in 5-10 years. I find it necessary that you're angry about this, because in 5-10 years your job will be (if t hasn't already) replaced by a computer. Good talk.

And...how's that going for them?
