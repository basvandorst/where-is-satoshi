This community is something. The price goes up – it is a good sign. The price goes down – it is also a good sign.

I got fucked hard in 2018 but kept holding and accumulating nonetheless. No need to reply, just keeping you informed.

What defines a shitcoin for you? And please don’t tell me it’s just the fact that it’s not a Bitcoin because it’s simply dumb.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:55:32
Why not educate such people? What’s the difference?
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:54:35
Wondering how you come up with this number.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:29:06
I apologize but I still don’t see how this explains the 80-90% claim. I’m pretty sure there are far more bitcoin users than that of who are using the app you’re developing for buying and selling drugs.
Are you a Telegram developer? The “chats making way to us” thing is quite disturbing haha.

What are talking about, I do not own any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. I’m just being open minded towards other projects and think it’s silly to disregard them solely by the fact “they are not bitcoin”.

Best definition of TA.

Something which you refer to as “most likely” in one sentence cannot be called a fact in the following sentence.

If they criminalize bitcoin it means you can’t buy goods and services with it legally. How would btc maintain the status of a currency in this case?
I mean, nobody would even sell a coffee for it since then governments would screw you for it... I’m just trying to understand how independent we’re from governments. Maybe it’s just my thinking since I’m from Russia and I may very well imagine btc banned and here. Government overthrow would probably be the only option to allow that not happen.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:22:06
When is the end though?
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:27:56
How do I call you then?
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:26:40
Why end it so early, you’ll miss all the fun.

Not sure where you get the idea that I’m implying governments are all powerful and so forth. Just wondering what we people gonna do when governments decide to oppose btc so for saving the power they hold. 
Do not be naive in thinking they will give it away freely. I doubt they will try to “ride” btc either, because they must understand they cannot ride the market without a reign in the long term.

I wish I could share this meme with my bitcoiner friends but I have none
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:41:56
They may ban btc and make the transactions illegal. People will be scared to use bitcoin If they may go to jail for using it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:25:39
Can it really happen while there’s so much inequality in how btc is distributed?
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:18:12
No access buddy
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:27:50
Wrong. 1btc = X purchase power where X varies significantly on a daily basis.
@_date: 2019-04-14 17:17:00
That is assuming the phone must necessarily substitute all those things. 9/10 I pay with my phone, though I still carry my debit card with me. But I’m already used not to carry it with me when I know for sure that if I’m going out my phone will suffice to everything payment related.

As if the amount means anything without the context of value. Talk to Venezuelans about the amounts.

Being limited in application to daily transactions doesn’t strike me as the most solid competitive point.

Sounds a lot like bitcoin doesn’t it? I don’t know who else if not bitcoin could accomplish that.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:46:32
Anyone else more than halfway through?

Same, started accumulating in November 2017, suffered through 2018 but kept adding up value little by little. Expected to reach 1 bitcoin by the time recovery starts but starting to doubt I’ll have enough time to do that with these recent bumps.
