It's probably not a good idea to give an exact amount because hackzors, but it's a whole number. The transaction is dated October 2012.

I am NOT using it for drugs. I am working a 12 step program with a sponsor who has a sponsor.
If I do cash it out, I am leaning towards using it to make some of the substantial financial amends I owe, but that's step 9 and I am not that far yet.

I drink coffee and most of the people I see at meetings are two decades older than me (except the girls who tend to be roughly a decade younger, aparently they speed towards rock bottom faster?). I need something to break the boredom while I look for a job.

I can't do that. Bad experiences with Ether in the past.

Their concern was I might do something rash like buy a house and sportsbike and start living like "I have arrived" when I need to work on my humility.

Well, release is a bit dramatic. There wasn't even a fence. Just a town of a couple hundred people where everybody knows everyone and their dog surrounded by miles of cornfield... which was probably a better fence than a fence.
I don't know if its a sobriety thing or a money thing, but I am starting to sympathize more with conservative ideas than I used to. Just I don't think I'm ready to start dealing with suits or brokerages yet. They say you have to change everything, but I don't think the big guy, as I understand him, wants me to turn into a square.

Your higher power is one that you can accept. One kid at meetings I frequent has a transformer on a light pole as his, because all that electricity gives it more power than he has. Stop being so judgmental. Not everyone wants to dignify the three way battle between Jesus, Allah, and Moses.

Is the paper thing really necessary? You guys gotta understand the problems of having money, right? 
Is there a good way to convince my sponsor that getting a Suzuki Hayabusa and a cute house near the lake is the kind/loving thing to do for my fellow man, because it shows victory over circumstances or some shit?
