Why are your linebreaks so big, guy?

But that's not what you did, lol. All you did was calculate how long it would take to sha256 numbers 1 through 2^256 
You answered a question, but not the question you asked. You do realize this, right?

Ok, so if you hash a lot of numbers eventually you will find an address that's active. But you don't have the private key for that address because what goes into the hash function is the public key. So now you have an address and the public key that belongs that address. How is this a "crack of a private key for its funds"?

Interesting ideas. What incentive would miners have to secure a Twitter blockchain?

Preventing runaway inflation is a pretty good reason to take some money out of the economy.

I said governments work to prevent *runaway* inflation.
You're right though, governments want inflation but not a lot, like a percent or two pa. It's not to increase revenue by bumping people into higher tax brackets, rather it's to encourage people to spend or invest their money because just holding money is bad for the economy.

Ok, guy. If a government wants more revenue they raise taxes. Encouraging inflation to bump people into higher tax brackets is a ridiculous notion but I think you know that already.

Any chance you meant to reply to a different comment? If not, I have no idea what your point is.
