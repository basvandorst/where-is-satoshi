Ok didn’t knew about that, had no problem with it since.

I’m not complaining about fees.
I’m complaining about the fact that I lost money whereas I should’ve gained because the BTC got up.
Apparently Coinbase don’t show the currency right.
Ex: I thought I bought at 13,800$ in reality it was 15,350$ ... I never had this issue in 4 months

???? You can verify by yourself

Yes I think that’s the right answer, I never had that problem since I use it

Thanks, i did it and got exactly 15 609 wich is correct BUT Coinbase still shows 13 800 at the time i bought it :(
The probleme is that i bought for 892 dollars but now I got 792 dollars (atm).
I mean the moment i bought it, i had a big difference, lost ~60$ at one click

I bought at deep, it’s got a little up, normally I should gain some $ but instead I lost ��
I bought at 13.800 for 890$ ($13 fee) from wallet. The currency of BTC got a little up to 14.300, but it shows that I have 821$ worth of BTC which is less.
EDIT for clarity

Apparently it’s not their priority at the moment, I will try 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:27:58
Thanks I will check

Apparently it shows that I bought it at 15 200$ which is not true.
At 12:38 (the hour I bought) it was at 13.800/13.900 you can verify by yourself.

Yes I m thinking to go to another software without fees and correct price 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:26:38
Here is the proof
[the time I bought, 12.863€ (15,350 $)](
[The price at the time I bought](
So apparently coinbase don’t show the right currency 
EDIT: added the price at the time I bought
