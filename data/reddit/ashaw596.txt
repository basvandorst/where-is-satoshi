Was so confused and a bit mad about this post until I read the op comment. So confusing out of context now that he changed his post.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:38:20
It was a semantic correction about the op saying they did the "right" thing originally indicating they had a moral obligation instead of doing it out of moral decency.
Op has since changed post in agreement.

Yeah It's alot better now. But it's still a bit than credit card fees right now for small transactions. But the incentives aren't there most of the time right now. You can get 2% rewards on credit cards easy right now. The owners would have to give me  something equal plus fees for it to be even. And the owners usually are paying a seperate fee for processors to convert to usd anyways. Depends I guess. Still doesn't seem practical.

Wait, if its cash reserves, whats wrong with converting it now? Don't they only want seasoned funds for the down payment? Just cash out the BTC and say you have 6 months cash reserves next time. Do they really care that those funds are seasoned too?

That's ridiculous. Meh
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:49:40
But that's for store of value then not for actual transactions. I guess it's still not unusable for that. =/
@_date: 2017-07-03 02:37:14
So I keep seeing these posts. With fees as high as they are. Does anyone actually use any of these right now?
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:18:41
There are fees, but they're usually around 3% at most. Less usually. Square is 2.75% rn. Wholesale can get lower fees. Right now to send  a random transaction confirmed in an hour my wallet adds a 1.75 fee. 68 cents I guess for 4 hours. Maybe for like a big dinner for multiple people it might make sense. But most card mininums are like $10 maybe? 68 cents would be 6.8% fees. I guess you could accept low fee no confirms, but it could be more risk than mom and pops really want. 
Its just doesn't make much sense right now for everyday stuff that's like $5-$30.

My point and original question is about practicality. It is currently widely used as an investment, store of value, and money movement. I was wondering if it is actually commonly used for everyday transactions anywhere. This is a question of practicality and fees. Are people in Argentina or anywhere else using it for practicalities sake? I'm not being rhetorical. I want to know and why is it practical for them? I don't think it is practical here compared to credit cards. Is it practical there due to too much inflation on local currency or lack of other institutions?

Dalek? 
=). Jk. Look up the UASF and Bip148.

For perspective, given an Apr of 5%. That's 800+ of missed interest over 4 weeks. You should take action ASAP if it's not resolved. Threatening suit is a great way of getting a company to notice their negligence.
Edit: math error
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:37:57
Woops you right. 5% isn't unrealistic though. Average for S&amp;p500 from 1950 to 2009 was 7%. 5% is quite possible on long term high risk investments.

I hate the media. Second time today I see misrepresentations of news about bitcoin...
What he said was that he "guesses it is" and he can't see what is backing bitcoin.
From the transcript 


Personally, I think that while there is not concrete backing for bitcoin. It is currently being backed by popular belief in its value. Like gold, if people are "willing to exchange their goods for it" its value will stay. Its ease of transferance. Its true it doesn't have any traditional backing, but in reality the intrinsic worth of gold and silver (or its value if it was only used for comercial manufacturing) is much lower than its market value. Bitcoin's instrinsic worth might be nothing (or the cost of mining), however, popular belief and the incredible usefulness of it as a medium exchange can give it value in the market.

Not really. Banks are just the center of the economical system. Good or bad, they are currently the basis of the money movements around the globe. Bitcoin is a good decentralized "alternative". (I think bitcoin is really going to succeed and it is a great way to guard against overcentralization and corruption, but I don't like overgeneralized statements.)

Dang, European banks must suck. I don't have any charges like that. Just 50 dollar overdraft fees, but I try to avoid thos :/. Is that just that bank or do alot of other banks around the world charge ridiculous fees like that?
