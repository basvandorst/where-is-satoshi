I like this word. These days it describes perhaps up to half of the posters here. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:00:42
When it comes down to it I guess we all know who to thank for all of these dumb posts. Thanks Gavin. Your our hero. The guy who recently has tried so hard to fuck things up for all the hundreds of hard working developers who actually do see a future in the greatest digital currency ever created. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:18:11
Okay well can you sell your coins to me because it would appear you missed out on the hundreds of positive announcements over the last few months. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:56:42
OMG "A number of shops around the world have stopped accepting bitcoins, such as the Nottingham microbrewery"
They are correct.  Bitcoin is collapsing !
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:11:44
Sounds about right.  When there's big money involved it's not hard to pay a few people to create multiple reddit accounts.  Okay it's a very wild guess but I would say that most of the blocksize needs to be increased asap posts here are from the same group of people who up until a while ago had no interest in bitcoin. The Classic promotion idea just happens to fit in nicely with the plans to disrupt even if there has already been an agreement NOT to vote for Classic by the majority of the miners.

Have you checked into the 100 or so positive announcements that have come out in the last few months.  As for cashing out. I highly doubt it. By this time most of the people here are I think easily able to spot the spam posts here.

Well thanks to your excellent web site bitcoin's looking much better.  Think the site was a bit overdue but I'm very glad to see it up and running.  Since the site went up I hear a lot less complaints about communication issues.  Hope to see many more updates on that site:

Another FUD post because anyone who's been following bitcoin would I am sure not be talking like this. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:39:10
He's perfectly correct. We should have no problem with ten million coffee transactions and a few hundred million micro payments a day once they are all handled through the one or two centralized bitoin nodes that are left remaining. 
As for what all the huge number of skilled and dedicated developers working on off-chain highly scalable solutions are going to do well I don't know.  Maybe they will all just give and start working on Ethereum.

The hourly FUD post strikes again ...
@_date: 2016-03-07 06:35:31
I agree with you but the 100s of Classic promoters here will probably out vote me.  As for 75%, well Classic want that because it increases their chance of getting what they want from 0% to 0.1%.  I suppose if they could do it with 5% block vote support they would try for that also. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:19:10
I think it's a spam post but yeah sure they will miss out. Nobody in their right mind would sell right now before halving and with all the new and amazing stuff that's starting to get announced right now. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:36:18
yeah why not?  But there again this is nothing more than the hourly FUD post so please disregard my answer as I don't want to promote more FUD.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:24:11
You're wasting your time here with attempts to tell us all how bitcoin is failing.  Have you checked number of transactions going up and up. Did you notice any new announcements lately. You're fooling nobody any more.  
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:41:12
Starting to sounds like such a dumb reply and I think almost everyone here knows it by now. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:13:35
If somebody can give me a valid reason why bitcoin will fail then I might consider reducing my holdings.  For the last 9 months I have not seen ANY single thing that would lead me to expect it to fail and I have seen hundreds of reasons for me to expect it to succeed. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:40:54
LOL yeah he does
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:27:59
hmm yeah I guess it is easy to modify CSS but not really sure what that has to do with anything. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:58:32
Great FUD.  Seems like a lot of the older established companies are getting pretty scared of the idea that the newer companies could get in their with new networks such as LN and disrupt their business model of a million cups of coffee a day all showing up on the blockchain!
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:26:06
This is terrible news.  Do you mean that people are doing transactions. I thought the network was full to capacity and everything was falling apart.  "
Seriously some of the posts like this one are getting so pathetic all I can do is laugh when I see them. On the plus side at least I get some amusement from the forum these days. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:09:28
Looking on the bright side a decrease in price over the short term would enable many of us to purchase more bitcoin.  I already have a reasonable amount but will for sure be purchasing more before the halving and before the next 100 positive announcements that come out over the next couple of months.
