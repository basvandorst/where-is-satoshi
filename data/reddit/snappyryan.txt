Welcome to bitcoin. In case you didn't know, this forum hasn't always been about what percent gain you can get on your investment. If you care, research the cypherpunk movement.
I don't expect you to, but the first

Bitcoin block stated, by satoshi, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," which shows the doctrine of bitcoin's vision from the cypherpunk movement, that we should not have trusted third parties

I hear that capital controls make it very hard to get out of Korea. But if you can do it, it's like a license to make money. If you have a bank account I say try it with small amounts if it's not against the law.

BitPay is a zit on the ass of bitcoin right now.
I really like this idea, since BitPay has been hostile to the community since BIP148, we really need a better solution that actually cares about SegWit implementation and actually making transactions cheaper.
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:05:44
Think about this: the amount of bitcoin put into circulation will inevitably go to zero around 2140. The amount of US dollars being put into circulation will keep approaching infinity.

Seems like Poloniex created a shitcoin and is pumping it. 
Just a guess though.
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:57:04
They don't care. It's a red herring. They don't really want BU, they just want to sustain making a killing from the exponentially-increasing fee market.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:01:53
Agreed, hit an all time high today before the announcement so no complaints. Shouldn't take too long to get back in bull-mode

As long as your permanent address is in the US use Gemini. You'll need a copy of your electric bill or internet bill to prove you live in the US, but that'a the only hassle.
I used to use Coinbase, the first 2 weeks I tried to use it they denied me until I started spamming their customer service, then they finally let me buy.
In addition to this, Gemini has a $500 limit and will credit bitcoin to your Gemini account as soon as you initiate an ACH payment.
If you think the ETF won't be approved, get your Gemini account up and running then wait for the ETF to be pushed back or denied, then buy. There may be a small dip in the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:08:59
This is definitely a good thing for the Bitcoin community in general, it was childish to say the least of Coinbase to be removed in the first place. At this point in time considering the community, we should be trying to get as much publicity as possible especially considering how small Bitcoin is in terms of monetary value vs. how large it could be in the future

If there's a hard fork you still own the same addresses, and you now have coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:37:18
Hold! Just remember we hit an all time high today, so it shouldn't take too long to get back to a decent level ;)
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:57:08
People who are buying from now up until March 11 and are buying only because they're speculating that it's going to be approved may exit the market right when it doesn't approve, but I don't expect it to cause a significant price change.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:51:05
Just the name "Bitcoin Unlimited" could confuse newcomers though..

His economic arguments are politicized, and not to mention, usually incorrect.

Actually, this is quite a relevant psychological level, and markets are based on mass psychology.
In 2013 when bitcoin had its run-up, the price kissed this level, didn't quite surpass it, then started to shoot downwards. 
I'm very interested to see what happens when we hit gold parity this time, and even more interested to see what happens when we surpass it!
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:08:51
You'll need to go on their website and send them a copy of your internet/cable/electricity bill to prove you're a US resident, that's the only big inconvenience about Gemini.
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:18:08
It certainly could be, there was a point where BU blocks got up to 44% in a 24-hour period. But we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:50:00
Did you use a high enough fee?
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:59:28
Depends on how you define 'millionaire.' A million dollars? In what, liquid currency? Invested capital? Assets? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:31:51
I didn't want to believe it, but this is becoming more and more apparent over time.
You can't legitimately think that it's safer to have a hard fork and deliberately block the fix to transaction malleability, while obviously having a significantly less talented development team without some kind of conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:30:53
Think about this: there was a bug in the BU code (bitcoin.com mining pool) that caused them to mine a block bigger than 1MB, causing them to lose the block (13.2 bitcoins) and a bunch of BU nodes got banned from the network for propagating it.
But it's not an argument about developing skills, it's political. This is a replay of Bitcoin Classic and XT, an attempt of another hostile takeover of the development of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:06:14
There is hope!!
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:28:14
Never say never, the price of bitcoin is unstable because it's in a very young stage and doesn't have an enormous market capitalization to support stability... yet. Why do you think larger currencies have such stability? Their currencies have trillions of dollars of value and liquidity going into their markets every day. :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:53:23
Just got my 0.14 node up yesterday! :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:54:27
I wouldn't say that they want to "destroy" bitcoin, but Roger Ver and his team have personally admitted to diversifying a decent amount of their bitcoin holdings into alts. 
Roger knows he has the power to pump alts just by posting about it, and this screams conflict of interest when his developers can't even put out decent code, while deliberately blocking a great protocol upgrade in bitcoin.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:02:46
I bet we'll get a pump when it comes back online

Bitcoin price is +0.01% in the past 24 hours on GDAX! Actually pretty surprised that we're already above the peak price of the January run-up, at this point we're +23% for the year! Can't complain!

Pretty sure that SW blocks being mined are at an all time high for the last 1000 blocks, according to what you posted. Doesn't seem like they're dropping...

Gotta buy the dip!
Funny that bitcoin price on Coinbase is the same as it was exactly 24 hours ago...
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:03:00
I bought some at $1000 ;D
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:13:40
That's more than likely only variance, for the prior 144 block period (24-48 hours ago), more blocks were signalling SW than BU. 
Besides, SW ~~and BU have~~ takes 2,016 blocks into account for activation, so it makes no sense to look at 144 block periods or even 1,000 block periods.
SW activation for last 2,016 blocks is essentially at all time highs.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:04:40
Personally I hold about 90% bitcoin and 10% ether, considering the halving is coming up I might convert to 95%+ bitcoin though..

Is spoofing illegal in the jurisdiction of Hong Kong?
If not it's likely that Bitfinex is doing this themselves considering the fact that there would be no consequences. Obviously speculation on my part.

Don't feed the trolls. 95% of people not in bitcoin haven't even heard of btrash, let Roger waste his bitcoin on astroturfing, marketing, and spamming the bitcoin blockchain. The less attention they get, the better. And the more decentralized bitcoin gets ;)

Most of the charities converted the BTC directly to USD to support the charity, so it definitely has downward pressure on the price. To what extent, we don't know.
Nonetheless, cheers to the creator of the Pineapple Fund for such a great contribution to humanity! :)

@_date: 2017-10-04 01:43:33
It wouldn't be strange, but the idea of unit bias is real. How many times have you talked to real people and they've said, "I want to buy a bitcoin, but now it's $X,000!" Just the idea that it's $10,000 may deter adoption. When bitcoin hits $10,000, it would be in our best interests to switch to bits (millionths of a bitcoin) as an actual unit. This way a bit would be about $0.01, and there would be less unit bias in the perspective of people who haven't yet adopted.

LedgerX was approved recently by the CFTC to be the first company in the US to trade bitcoin options and derivatives. They could possibly start legitimate trades with large institutions as early as this month.
Looks like they're just testing it.. but hopefully it will be open to big investors soon! 
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:55:09
Right now there's a backlog of about 40k unconfirmed transactions on blockchain.info, this is more than likely the cause for it taking so long.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:21:35
Bubble? Look at some of these altcoins. 
When bitcoin price bubbled in early 2013 it went up 20 times in 13 weeks. In late '13/early '14 it went up 4.5 times in 8 weeks. Those are bubbles, at this point we've only went up 100% in 6-7 weeks, so that's a relatively low gain as opposed to prior bitcoin bubbles or the current altcoin bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:18:40
Thank you! We definitely need more people educated about how to signal and enforce UASF on our nodes, unfortunately shills will downvote threads like this. Users need to take back Bitcoin from big mining interests!
*Note: this only signals UASF on your node, doesn't enforce it. For more information about UASF enforcement via your node, visit segwit.co

Just buy coin, I mined for 9 months and regretted it, would have doubled my money if I just bought coin. The mining equipment becomes obsolete very quickly and mining companies use the hardware before they sell it to profit even more. 
And yes, "mining contracts" or "cloud mining" is almost always a scam.

The mempool isn't full at all.
There are ~4,500 unconfirmed transactions and they still haven't sent the coins out. This points to the fact that their API is out of whack.

@_date: 2017-05-24 21:12:55
Value will revert from altcoins to BTC, most volume from alts on Polo is in terms of BTC, so people will dump their alts into BTC and drive the price up when the bubble pops

Visa averages 2,000 per second
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:34:20
Yep, 210,000 blocks after the second.
The time difference between the first and second halving seems to be 3 years and about 3.5 months, so i'm guessing for the third halving to be around March 2020, around what time would you estimate it to be?
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:03:40
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:57:17
At this rate the fourth halving might not even be in 2024, but perhaps in 2023.
