I was at one point told Armory was best. Is this no longer true (and if so why)?

Why does everyone only really talk about Bitcoin in terms of an investment like precious metals? I keep $100 USD worth of Bitcoin in a hot wallet because, the way it was explained to me, Bitcoin is a *medium of exchange* (like fiat) ?

If we're going to far as to be paranoid of that, then we should also consider the keyboard itself to be compromised and recording keystrokes.
Sure it's possible, but it's only really feasible by something like a government. It may well be cheaper to make a target disappear and get their BTC via $5 wrench at that point

While the double negative is incorrect, it'll convey less chance of failure than if I were to say significant, even if it is **statistically** significant. In layman's, significant means "likely", and I'm too lazy to find actual failure statistics to properly convey chance of failure.

You can't just go trolling around about grammar. Language is about the communication of concepts. If I conveyed "likely" over "not too likely", and I had intended the latter, would I not have failed in the purpose of language?
Don't get so hung up on grammar, especially in a living language :)

You forgot to say get IMGBURN or similar to make ISO images of the USB drive to replicate to a second one for backup. DD also works. 
Flash drives have a not insignificant chance of random failure. 
Edit: I say imgburn and DD because Rufus uses ISOs and raw DD to flash drives

Point, I was just thinking the preservation of the persistent storage and didn't think much beyond that, my bad.

It isn't *for* autism, it *causes* autism. Like vaccines.
