But i takes like two seconds to just check the adress. I honestly don't believe that this would have fooled mtgox for any major sum of coins and absolutley not to make them bankrupt. No human in mtgox's support team would just assume major sums of coins never made it to the blockchain more than maybe 10 times before either contacting a developer or researhcing the issue.

"It also says up to about 30 million dollars worth of customers' cash deposits are also missing."  
Eeeeh, how can that just be missing? Where did they go? Did someone hack their bank accounts and just sent 30 million dollars to some off-shore account and they didn't even ask for confirmation? How can this even happen?

Copy pasta from Bitstamp:  
"When you place an instant order, we add an order at the current bid or ask price (depending on the type of the order). If there is not enough bitcoins available at that price, your order will remain open until someone sells or buys additional bitcoins at that price. Our trading engine will then reposition your order every 10 minutes to the current order book offer."

But when they contact Gox, won't they just chech both the txid and the target adress? Don't they save the adress I put in when withdrawing coins at all? I get that their automated system just checks the txid but IF they need to contact the support it's super easy to see IF somethings fishy right?

I wouldn't do it any other way. I just can't figure out how Mtgox's support allowed this to happen. The protocol "bug" didn't allow anyone to just go in an take everything, they needed to confuse the support team. Who thought it was a smart idea just to have 750000btc in a hot wallet? I just can't understand how this actually happen...

Shibuya is one of the most central areas in Tokyo. Don't know if you are trolling or not but Shibuya crossing is like the Time Square of Tokyo.

It's just impossible that during the last year nobody at mtgox just brought out the old calculator just to check the numbers. I'm honestly stunned! At my work the economics team breaths fire when the excel sheets doesn't adds up down on the dollar each month.

It blows my mind on so many levels. I would really like to see the real story sometime in the future.  
Ok, the btc is gone but where are all the fiat money and the revenues? This isn't silk road, this is a real company in japan!

In bittorrent I can see the ip-adresses of everyone who is seeding. Will I be able to see who is "seeding" these sites? If so then anyone can see everyone who is visiting the site.

You can do this on most large exchanges. I use Bitstamp

Just moving them would be enough to make an impact on the price.

Are you talking about gox? Good luck getting that fiat money out

I use Silk Road as a mixing services. Don't know how secure that is but it seems to work just fine for my needs.

they seized something like 27000BTC. People are just sending amounts like $0.001 to attach a message.
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:05:43
That don't seem to be very smart
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:07:21
Seized coins from DPR and all of the coins on the site.  
What do you mean by customers buying a user's amount?
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:29:11
Yeah. Is there a law that says that I need to get the exact same currency from my bank account when I take it out? Aren't regular banks doing the exact same thing? 
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:22:24
But people think they do for some reason
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:28:55
3 days
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:10:10
Have anyone tried it?

In a perfect competition no profits can be made. It's one of the most basic elements in an open economy.
