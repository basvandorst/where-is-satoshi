Only to summarize some of the hypotheses thrown around here:
* 1) A whale...
* 1a) ...has had its crazy bot malfunction.
* 1b) ...has had its auto-trading rules miss this failsafe.
* 1c) ...has been hacked.
* 2) Money Laundering?
* 3) API Glitch.
* 4) Time-traveler buys cheap bitcoin (?)
All we know is:
* A) The whole order book was eaten.
* B) It happened simultaneously on BTC and LTC.

Now he's commented on an answer of mine where I say that anyone could be Satoshi. Hahaha, what the hell.

Our savior Satoshi is a comedian. Hahaha.

I thought about the possibility haha.

The guy is fully into character, take a look at his comments. It's amazing what people do for attention/whatever. Hahaha.

It was a platform error. It's back online. Bitcoin sites were not the only ones affected.

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?

Only good thing is this served as "penetration testing" for Andresen and Matonis. The telenovela is over.

Even helping her with her luggage would be wonderful I guess.

Thanks, great recommendations. Thankfully I solved this with a friend.

Sorry, my girlfriend is a bit shy and wouldn't feel very well if were more specific right away.
I'm going to send her about 2k USD. That should cover the ticket. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:38:32
Thanks, I'll look into this.
