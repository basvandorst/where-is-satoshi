I mean we’re talking about a principal you learn in high school. Thinking volatility could be good for a currency only impacts you (and the people who will judge you for holding an objectively stupid opinion).
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:31:50
By this logic literally anything can be a good medium of transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:53:36


This is a principle of currency. Volatility hinders trade and investment relies on volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:32:43


There is no *good* argument. Provide an argument for why it’s a good means of trade and I’ll explain why it isn’t.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:16:54
Oh man, it’s like middle school all over again.
I’m not sure what you’re saying because your grammar is shit and you’re not actually making any points.
I understand you’re getting defensive to prop up your ego, instead of considering you don’t have a clue.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:41:32




No. It would take a counter example where volatility is proven good for the currency, not just a counterexample where there is volatility and a working currency. If I were saying volatility prevents trade altogether, you'd be right and all you would need is one example. But, we're talking about whether volatility hinders trade, not prevents it altogether.


That wasn't your argument; it's closer to the argument you're trying to fight.
Let's recap
Someone else said:


You said: 


I responded:


Then you spent a couple responses trying to say because some people like a volatile currency (BTC) that it's arguable that volatility is good for a currency, which is really irrelevant to the initial assertion: that volatility is **bad** for a currency, not that volatility makes a currency unusable.


The irony.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:50:33
I’m not sure what you’re saying, because frankly I don’t think you know what you’re saying. I understand the distinction; I spent 4 years of undergrad learning the distinction. What I don’t understand is why you think that’s relevant.
I understand the “currency games” you believe “banksters” play. The distinction between speculating on a stable currency is the high leverage required for currency speculation, due to low volatility relative to bitcoin, an unstable commodity, that needs no leverage for speculation. 
There’s an important point there you’re missing which is central to why BTC is a terrible currency. I can’t understand it for you though, bud.
All of this is pointless seeing as adoption of bitcoin for use as a currency has heavily lagged behind its user growth. Do transactions per month double every 12 months like users do? No? Because it’s a shitty currency partially because it’s too volatile, and volatility hinders trade.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:42:10
Who *were* talking about trade?
Trade is the entire purpose of currency.
I said very little. The only long comment came when you lost track of the point.

I could care less is not used ironically, however, and isn’t sarcasm, regardless of stress pattern.
If anything that stress pattern highlights the user’s misunderstanding.
Edit: I read the discussion. It’s pretty clear the author is explaining that though it’s been adopted in colloquial use in America, and adopted as a similarly sarcastic phrase from Yiddish origins, it’s not the same and instead highlights how Americans are terrible at grammar and rhetoric.

Construction was more of a symptom than a cause. Without the supply increase you’d have had greater price inflation since demand increases (a shift) wouldn’t be met by supply increases (a shift).
As you kind of said: the primary issue was illicitly driven demand forcing prices artificially high.
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:14:49
Inflation happens when you increase supply, but that doesn’t mean inflation IS an increase in supply.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:53:03
I wouldn't say that so emphatically. The market is brittle right now and if anything even minor negative happens (something as stupid as Silk Road having problems) the market will react quite dramatically. I'm waiting for Mtgox to fully collapse then repurchasing my previous holdings.

I'm not referring to non-interventionism, I'm referring to his interest in ending ALL foreign aid. I fail to see your connection between bombing other countries and monetary policy. Perhaps you meant fiscal policy.

We're not celebrating their loss, we're celebrating the end of a bad time in Bitcoin.
Besides, if you're investing in Bitcoin you have to be prepared to lose your entire position. Sure, people are losing heaps over this, but it was their prerogative to use, and continue to use, Mtgox. It's hard to sympathize when someone knowingly gambles and loses.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:19:25
Cute. If you find the strength to get over yourself google Ron Paul foreign policy and tell me which part is wrong.

See, I wasn't even getting at his non-interventionist stance because it's one of his least absurd opinions. I'm referring more to his interest in ending ALL foreign aid. 
You compound that with his interest in ending the oil trade (don't get me started about his disbelief of global warming), removing foreign military bases, disinterest in acting to prevent genocide in Africa. The guy is an isolationist and is out of touch with even 20th century politics.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:20:46
I'd imagine you get that Manchin, a Senator, wrote a letter to Yellen, head of the Fed, asking her to ban Bitcoin, not knowing that Bitcoin has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve and can more realistically be impacted by Manchin himself.
The part you're missing is that Manchin is an idiot for not understanding the duties of the fed and it's funny.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:12:21
I don't see the oil trade as a problem in and of itself. Foreign military bases exist for a variety of reasons not limited to poor decision making in the States. I would trace genocide in Africa back to European colonization. 
If these problems were our fault they would also be our responsibility, though.

A bitcoin economy does not mean the absence of other currencies. There will always be home currencies to tax in and bitcoin will be taxed based on their conversion to home currency.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:10:05
Regulation of other currencies is not the duty of the Fed and at less than a tenth of the value of their monthly bond purchases I couldn't possibly see the Fed caring to make it their business.
When a Fed president, chair, governor says "that's not our duty" they're not saying "go legislate me more work". This is not a case of Yellen making a political grab at more responsibility, this is Yellen politely telling Manchin he has no clue what he's talking about. 
I find your social commentary comically ironic in the face of your understanding of the Fed.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:57:30

There are other BTC derivative sites. I believe the issue is liquidity and a lack of user base.

While I see tons of accusations, I don't see evidence of them stealing coins. I see evidence of them running a poorly designed website and being shitty programmers, but that's entirely different.
Edit. Never mind, it's pretty clear you don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:50:18
This is not how these words are used. Inflation almost exclusively refers to price inflation, especially when you’re not talking to economists.
There’s no good reason to say value of currency has inflated/deflated, instead of increased/decreased.

Supply and demand man. No one wants to pay more than they have to, but right now we don't have much of a coice. Until there are reasonable alternatives to Coinbase they'll be able to charge what they want.
In my eyes 1% is worth the trust I have in Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:28:22
Yes. When Mtgox announces they're closing their doors other markets will take a small hit then begin climbing in the following hours.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:54:13
Either you have no clue what you're talking about or I have no clue what I'm talking about.
When someone buys Bitcoin through an exchange they then have the rights to a Bitcoin. Once withdrew, the Bitcoin becomes tangible. My understanding is rather than simply stealing the BTC in the exchange, Mtgox would be purchasing them, through their own exchange, and then withdrawing them. So sure, you don't actually buy the Bitcoin through Mtgox, just the rights to the coin, but for someone on the inside who can withdraw via Mtgox buying the rights to a bitcoin and buying the bitcoin are one in the same.
You say you "don't actually buy [bitcoin] on them", but really what's the difference? I'm not about to pay an exchange for Bitcoin unless I'm sure I also have the right to withdraw said Bitcoin. If I make a purchase on an exchange I am buying Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:04:31
I didn't downvote you... I asked for where there was proof of them stealing and instead you showed me angry people with accusations.
I didn't even think you were wrong, I just wanted some proof.

You're right, 1% is going to turn people away, but things will change by the time JQP is buying Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community is still comprised of relatively early adopters and the exchanges can get away with charging a premium because of it. Higher risk, higher required return on capital.
By the time the average Joe is buying Bitcoin the exchanges will have far more competition, far more customers, and far less risk, and as a result won't be charging nearly as much.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:19:56
Is someone going to make this post every time someone moves 6 figures of BTC?
The coins were stolen over the course of years, not all at once. And even if they were only recently moved, I highly doubt they thieves would be shifting their BTC publicaly a mere day after the theft came to light.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:36:54
Because Bitcoin is being forced down artificially by hype related to Mtgox. Anyone who follows Bitcoin closely knows Mtgox's demise is good for the bitcoin community (at least in the long run). In the short run the attention will hurt Bitcoin, but serious adopters and investors will ride the dip and buy at the bottom.

Bitcoin has a 1 year price range of 5,800 to 20,000. You're trying to say there's a causative relationship between 2% USD inflation and &gt;300% BTC price growth.
BTC has had price swings (by %) in 10 minutes larger than USD's change in purchasing power for an entire decade.

The criticisms have little to nothing to do with his self help stuff. JBP's issues are conflicting views on changing human behavior (self help) juxtaposed against the implication that gender dynamics are inherent and don't need to change, how he avoids ever making a point to avoid having his fundamentalist philosophies challenged, and how he preys on a demographic that has been left behind by society by providing not so novel self help to entrap them in his terrible world views then selling shit to them.
Love him for his self help shit all you want, even if most of his ideas are things regular functioning people already do and most of his ideas can be found in any self help book, but don't pretend people dislike him because of his self help coaching.

A lot of misinformation going on here.
The discount rate is currently 1.75. The interbank/federal funds rate is currently 1.12. The fed does not loan out money at 1.25. 
The people who borrow money indeed get to spend it, but they also accrue interest on those loans and they're sure as shit not at 1.25 or 1.75. "Poor" people meanwhile experience wage growth at a rate that exceeds inflation due to the increase in output (google it if you don't believe me; it's demonstrable that nominal wage growth has outpaced inflation). If you remove inflation you can kiss a significant portion of that nominal wage growth goodbye. If you remove inflation you incentivize hoarding of cash instead of spending it as inflation results in a natural redistribution of wealth (eg wealth loses value, real cost of debt is reduced).


Your shitty conspiracy theories are a bad excuse for not understanding monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:48:13
The lender of last resort promises to provide money in the event liquidity fails. It has nothing to do with routine interest rate changes.
The fed doesn't really loan money when it raises or lowers interest rates. It offers a rate, thereby setting a ceiling or floor, forcing other banks to follow their prescribed interbank lending rate.


No, it sounds a lot like monetary policy.
