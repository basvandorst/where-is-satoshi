Inflation =/= Increase in token supply, you also have to account for velocity of money.
The only way an asset can be inflation-proof is if its supply is increased/decreased instantly depending on demand and related to the velocity. Bitcoin has a fixed supply-rate which completely ignores the demand, making bitcoin an inelastic asset, especially when new units cease to be mined

I'm probably way too late in the questions, but there's one that I notice that hasn't been asked by anyone yet and I would like to hear your input on it.
As bitcoin value might increase, so will the mining operations expand, with more computational power being used to secure the network and further electricity being consumed. 
As someone concerned with the environment, keeping the bitcoin network (a global network) alive in terms of electricity might be but a fraction of the current global set-ups of several credit cards, money transfer systems and services such as paypal might consume in electricity.
We will be able to bring most and probably all of that electricity from renewable sources way before bitcoin's mining "rush" ceases. However, I was wondering if its possible, desirable or if anyone in the core developing team has even thought of trying to make the software demand "less" electricity consumption by its hardware components. As a huge extrapolation, let's imagine that bitcoin became the de facto world currency and that maintaining such a system would take, say, 25% of all of Earth's electricity. These are an enormous amount of gigawatts that could perhaps be powering other more pressing global needs. Would there be a way to create software or hardware that would enable to secure the network in an increasingly energy-efficient way so that we could use our electricity in other important projects and everyday needs?
Thanks for your work so far, and for being here answering so many other questions of others!

Curious newbie question: how can bitcoin be sent without the Internet? Are you referring to just sending the private key? Don't you always need the blockchain (which counts as Internet) to verify the transaction?

So is Lamassu a portuguese company, or do they just manufacture it in Portugal? As someone who's been to Portugal often I've never seen one there nor have I seen any "bitcoin accepted here" signs either

Using the term hijacking presumes scarcity. There is no scarcity, the code was simply copied and altered. Whether this is good or even moral is another subject. But it was no takeover nor a "hijack"

also are they saying its actual users (each with a KYC identity attached) or is it rather the number of accounts? Big difference between the two

What's your source of those 276 cryptos and their lifespan numbers?
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:07:39
You are right. This likely has to do with the Tether conspiracy theory, there's not even "mainstream" investment fund adoption yet.

Since BTC is not targetting to be used as cash but instead more like a store of value, I don't see the point of  using mBTC. And from a trader's perspective the only thing that matters is BTC/USD and sats (satoshis) for alts
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:55:59
It also can't predict forks. So currently BTC price is quite close to the target ($10K), since BTC+BCH+BTG = $9700

Why haven't they? Presumably something is preventing them from pursuing that "easy route" of manipulation

99% of people are in crypto because of the volatility, though they dellude themselves that it has to do with changing the world or sticking it to the government.

Do you have evidence that most debt is "intra-governmental"? Not everyone can lend out money, there are many laws in place to prevent that. 
As far I know, capital markets are international, sovereign bonds are international. That's a whole different game since not everyone can buy those assets (one must be an accredited investor or a fund).
Also, debt does not generate wealth, assets generate wealth. Going bankrupt means creditors get your assets. If one writes an IOU then its a liability, if one buys an IOU then it's an asset.
Most countries can survive a default because their assets are worth more than their debt + interest (politicians of course won't survive that event). But one has to wonder, most countries can survive a default because they can sell to someone that is buying (either other countries or businesses or individuals). If there is a global default and there is no bid on these assets being sold then who can they sell to? And would they be able to get enough consider the lack of demand due to a downturn? A -60% on the stockmarket would be enough to trigger a global default for example. It's a good thing bitcoin does not cause such an effect with its own -60%.

Keep in mind the trade volume doesn't tell you much about people entering. It just tells you the demand (bids) relative to the supply (ask).
Perfectly reasonable that it was not so much new people that entered as it was simply more legit trade being done or more bots being engaged or more wash trading happening. Cryptomarkets are heavily manipulated, it is very hard to estimate liquidity at any given point without that number being "contaminated" by arbitrage bots or whales. See [this article]( for an example of the thought process trying to estimate liquidity.

If debts are forgiven or partially forgiven (since they will never be repaid), the countries have effectively defaulted. This will lead to a loss of confidence in other countries lending money to the bankrupt ones (thus much higher interest rates).
A number of measures such as currency devaluation, high austerity, and selling of public assets to help manage the existing debt will be performed. But if the phenomenon is global then it might be too strong a negative feedback loop to recover unless money is voluntarily or involuntarily taken away from individuals and businesses to help jumpstart the economy after such an event.

Great comment

I can send you gold, either physical or an electronic IOU. Some vendors even accept it as tender. You could argue with crypto you also rely on third parties to store it (people that make password generators, cold wallets, coinbase accounts, etc).
And the government can most definitely forbid crypto just as it can forbid gold. And the government can also seize it almost as easily (it has already seized hundreds of thousands of bitcoins from exchanges and individuals)
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:20:36
You can trade gold digitally. you don't need to physically move gold to trade it anymore than you need to physically move dollars.
