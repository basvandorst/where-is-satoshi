This is just one charity out of a bunch that the fund has supported.

Really? They are getting pretty tiresome tbh

That sentiment wholly depends on which side of the fence you sit on, does it not? There are many BCH proponents that believe BCH is the real bitcoin, and the segwit chain goes against Satoshi's vision. 
For the record I don't have a position on it, but it has been interesting to see both sides of the argument.

Does that really matter? I mean if the only people who were allowed to contribute to these discussions were such people it would be a different story perhaps, but that in and of its self is against free speech etc. How would you vet it, would you want to and so.

I think you're not considering the droves of people actually hoping for a temporary correction so they can get in at a lower price?

True of many many coins and tokens.

That's cute as well. Totally missed my point but good for you anyway.

Is this a meta comment on the $48,000,000 dollar short that backfired... completely

Mining needs specialist, scarce hardware that costs a lot these days. The assumption is you don’t have this.

You guys are so cute giving them a cute little different name. 
Not just you guys either, the btc guys give you lot cute little names as well. 
As an outsider with no stake in this really, I have to say in particular the people making up pet names are doing this whole fiasco the largest disservice. It's passive aggressive bullshit like that which stops productive discussion from ever starting.

Uugh. Dude. You know better than that. Hodl is an acronym. Spedn is just bad spelling on purpose. We're not inventing a new language here.

Normal currency, euro usd sterling etc.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:28:41
Ahhh shit. *holds arms up* you're right. I take it back. Apologies. 
Still not a fan of spedn but each their own. 
*hat tip*

AFAIK the next best thing if it's for long term storage is a paper wallet created from an offline fresh boot of Linux

I'm in the UK and would love to get into bee keeping, but I'll be honest if I had to contend with those bad boys I'd probably quite before I started.

How many satoshi for a jar of honey?
