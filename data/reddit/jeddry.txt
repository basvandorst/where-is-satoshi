The reason heroin leads to other crimes is the person can't get help, plus the prohibition makes the price probably 100x what it normally would be.  So they have to rob banks to satisfy their habit.  They should be able to get help from a doctor, not be locked in a cage.  If you do drugs then take shitty care of your kids or beat your wife, well thats a crime.  Charge the real crime and not the drug taking.

Alt-coins can have their place in this subreddit too sometimes.  Especially one like paycoin which has been getting huge attention lately.  Its failure will have a very negative impact on the perception of Bitcoin and crypto in general.

I think the Liberty Reserve guy should be set free.  I don't see any victims of Liberty Reserve.  A lot of victims are going to get hurt who fell for this GAW paycoin scam though.

I am quite skeptical of the GAW paycoin scam as well.  I think this is a lot different than honest free market activity.  They are claiming they are going to pump the price to $20 per coin and that is why a bunch of fools are jumping on board. They are making false/impossible promises. If this was just an honest freemarket thing, as a libertarian I am all for it.  But this thing has scam and fraudster written all over it.

Nobody believes those fake rumors made up by the feds to push their agenda out into the media to make their illegal actions of violating the 4th amendment look appeasing to the average joe.
