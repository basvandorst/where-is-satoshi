It's a fantastic Ted talk. Honestly it's a must watch imho.

This is why I am into DPoS more. You get that luxury to change something terrible, but it had to be done on consensus from block producers not a centralised entity. You can argue that the block producers could collude for personal aims, but if they truely are beholden to their delegators then we actually get decentralised + democratic representation for a community.
This will certainly be a hot topic in the next few years!

Hi, do you like owning a house, then you need to borrow money. Debt isn't bad at all, what's bad is when you can only just afford to pay your debt off. Then when circumstances change there's defaults and dominoes.

You have any substance to your thoughts, or just felt like a dismissive offhand remark?
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:56:02
Being honest, my initial impression of your comment was that it was made up. It's that simple.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:38:08
You're the man dude. I appreciate it very much. I meant no offensive so brazenly judging you either ❤️

Modern day democratic socialism means the government represents it's people, and it works all over the planet from Canada to Europe to New Zealand.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:20:28
I live in the real world where it ACTUALLY works. Go check out the world happiness report or any number of reports that track educational ability, general health standards, poverty, incarnation, crime etc. 
Try research or visiting any number of these Western countries that are crushing the USA in all of these vital statistics.

It's really cool ��

It comes from tax revenue from having a suitable tax system. The USA doesn't even have a VAT (value added tax) and the corporate lobbying is out of control. It also comes from the fact that when low to middle income earners earn more money they directly reinvest it in their local economies which then in turn creates more jobs, generates more tax revenue, and reduces other social expenses like crime/medical/legal.
USA general elections are also hardly functional either. They have a two party system where corporate backers can swing the primary nominee choice easily.  
We also afford it by not being victims to a military industrial complex, USA military spending could easily be cut to fund and boost the quality of life in the USA.

Modern day socialism doesn't mean you don't have the same right to private ownership, and it's much closer to capitalism than communism. The USA is just behind the times, what the rest of the 1st world calls  centre/centre-right the USA screams socialist.

You got it, and that's what we are doing in part with ICON. ICONs backing tech company called ICONloop is taking over in Korea these last few months:
 is the corporations that have the use cases.
The ICON public chain is that decentralised 3rd party storage. Come say hi over at r/helloicon if you want to discuss this more, we're always excited to welcome new community members.
In terms of creating trusted and reliable DIDs we are working on a number of theories, but in principle we have to make sure only approved sources are used.

How do you cool it? Are your lines chilled too? Moving beer in long warm lines can aggregate a foam issue.
@_date: 2019-12-11 10:49:57
Yes indeed, but it might need a lot less staff to manage 20 taps as an example and an auto ID check can help speed up service.
I can immediately think of an application where this machine could be left unattended but get use out of a built in ID check: closed private events without an open bar. Having your machine built with a system that naturally adds to harm prevention is great not only for child safety but also for your/your business customers' legal liability.
@_date: 2019-12-11 10:59:34
Hey mate, you should check out my comment in reply to him. You're both absolutely right and I wanted to share with you a quick update on how the ICON ecosystem is approaching this fun challenge.

Modern day democratic socialism is actually far better than you give it credit. It creates a stable and healthy working class. All statistics point to it being better in terms of reducing crime and poverty statistics, improving quality of healthcare whilst reducing the cost greatly, a happier society.
These things do not smother competition, they create an environment where innervators and entrepreneurs can thrive. We recognise that big businesses need a society to be able to profit, we recognise that big businesses use our public utilities in the conducting of their business and thus they are a benefactor of it. 
Most of all though we put a bit of value on our fellow mans life. We acknowledge that we are all in this together, and that our countries' economies are actually stronger and more resilient with a happier populace + a social safety net.
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:47:54
This is really cool ���� 
I'm a hospo manager that is also into blockchain tech. Do you have any plans for the technology at all?
Did you perhaps consider an auto pour system too? I'm just thinking about how many customers that would butcher pouring that beer xD
On top of that though the main thing that sticks out to me is age checking. Have you considered adding in decentralised blockchain ID tech to the payment process in the future?
@_date: 2019-12-10 23:41:45
It's just some people haven't thought it through. You could have your ID built into the payments app so it's a one scan payment with ID check built into it.
@_date: 2018-11-10 17:28:40
You are welcome, I got it all fixed that same night, but I appreciate that link!

ICON has chainID, a blockchain ID system up and running in a majority of financial institutions in Korea. To add to that it's being built into Samsung phones. I know the prices in the market are rough lately but chin up, actual tech progress is being made. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:40:56
Do you know wallet addresses? 
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:47:50
seriously, thank you. that was some funny shit, and after the day I just had it was most welcomed. Seeing as you didn't ask, My fridge freezer leaked water and it ran through my 1st floor and into my downstairs bedroom all over the floor and the side of a bed... Spent the better part of the evening in between juggling children fixing up all that mess. 1am.. done! fuck this and your's was the 2nd comment I read after sitting down. :D
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:35:46
There's tonnes of ways. I'm a community manager for ICON so I can at least give a specific example there.
chainID is a blockchain based authentication system that ICON has established and running in Korea within many of the leading financial institutions. Samsung and ICON are currently implementing the technology into Samsung smart phones/devices.

The total is kind of irrelevant as it's divisible, but the point is that it meets the category of scarce when considering if Bitcoin is a reliable store of wealth. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:50:59
There's no point arguing with each other, I've got nothing to gain by convincing you, so you can talk as much shit as you want about me chief. I'm gonna have my 2c now and I'm done discussing in this comment chain. 
Seeing as you are 'in the know', do you care to enlighten us all on how many staff Facebook have working for them on blockchain technology? I have a fairly decent idea because I follow a lot of news sources and have seen announcements on their job hirings in the field, so frankly I am not talking about wild fantasies, I'm discussing realistic possibilities. It also has to start somewhere, that start would br hiring staff. It's clear Facebook is interested in blockchain. Given it's a profit hungry machine almost anything must be on the table. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:10:55
I think you missed the point entirely. Facebook can easily create a decentralised coin that they offer support for. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:47:40
News flash, we are human, we all die. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:17:55
Who do you call smart? I've got time to research for myself so no need to shill too hard ��
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:07:56
Your lack of imagination doesn't deem a possible product non viable. Facebook could use it's own coin as a virtual currency for it's in built marketplace feature. It could be used as a token via advertising. There are a number of possibilities! 
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:36:40
If Facebook copied etherium or bitcoin, or just forked it and used the token in it's system there's not really much to hack, so long as their dapps are sound. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:47:32
Why do you persist? What do you have to gain by arguing around the point.
