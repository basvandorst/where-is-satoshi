It's more promising than ever. There has been a pretty noticeable media blackout on Dash over the past year so its understandable to think that nothing has been happening. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:37:39
As I said, you clearly don't understand how Dash works.

I don't know specifically which dnm use which coins as I don't use dnm's myself, however there was a report that came out about dnm's and which cryptos's they used. BTC was far and away the most used with ltc coming in next. It was a pretty big drop off after those two, but Dash did come in ahead of Monero. It was pretty insignificant for both though. Sorry I don't have a link to the study. 
The advantages that Dash has over BTC is that Dash offers instantly confirmed transactions and the ability to transact privately. We can debate the efficacy of Monero over Dash in regards to privacy but it can't be argued that Dash does not offer significant privacy improvements over btc and other non-private coins. Also, Dash has proven that it can scale to meet tx demand without resorting to hinky tech the LN. 
Monero has a real world use case because of its extreme privacy but that use case is going to be limited to niche markets because of all the compromises Monero has to make to achieve that privacy, and most people aren't going to make those sacrifices to buy a hamburger. With Dash, you can buy a hamburger using privatesend and not have to worry about the sales person tracing your change address back to your wallet and seeing how much money you have. 
These Monero vs Dash comparisons need to stop because they're not directly competing with each other. Monero is about privacy and nothing but privacy. Dash is about being a p2p payment system intended to replace fiat - aka digital cash.

OsrsNeedsF2P is just an ignorant Monero troll. You can safely ignore him.

None. Monero has virtually zero real world adoption. Dash has around 2000 merchants PLUS all integrations with various payment processors. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:30:53
It's not trusted. You have proven time again that you're nothing but an ignorant fudster. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:34:35
"control all the masternodes that do the mixing" - lol. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:19:37
Ok, fair enough. 
1. Yep, the instamine happened, but this happened long before the idea of masternodes was even conceptualized. It's also not nearly the big deal that trolls like Osrs make it out to be. It certainly wasn't some grand conspiracy - only an idiot would be dumb enough to believe that. 
2. There are around 4800 masternodes distributed anonymously throughout the world. It's literally impossible to hijack enough of them to cause any harm or gain any useful information. 
3. He's completely wrong here. The masternode count has been steadily rising since their inception. 
4. He has no idea what he's talking about. There is no way to analyze everyone using the privacy feature.

You Monero guys are funny. Dash has nearly 2000 merchants directly accepting it plus numerous payment processors and much higher tx count, and even more use on darknets, yet you believe that Monero which is accepted virtually nowhere has more real world adoption than Dash, lol. Ok, whatever you say pumpkin.

Ok, then please enlighten us with your vast in depth understanding of how Dash's PS works and how you can deanonymize the network by compromising MN's. I'll wait. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:12:37
You've been presented facts and details many times over but here you are still fudding. It's pointless to try to convince you other wise; you've incapable of accepting that you're wrong. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:33:22
Let me turn this around to you. How and what information would MN's share that would compromise someone? Please be specific. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:46:12
So what if there's a rich list? The top 100 are addresses that the owners want to be public. Privatesend balances show up as small, common denominations and are impossible to know who owns them. Having a rich list doesn't compromise anyone's privacy. The fact that Monero obfuscates everything simply limits it to small, niche markets. Monero will never become a commonly used currency because the compromises it makes to get that absolute privacy are to great that people will never use it as digital cash. 
The reason why people are moving to Dash from Bitcoin is because Dash offers instant confirmations, super low fees (far less than a penny), and has PrivateSend (which you don't seem to understand). It simply works better than bitcoin.

There currently is no IP masking in Dash. It's been discussed but I don't know if/when they plan to implement it. 
The current minimum rounds of mixing is two, but with the next update, that's being upped to four. 
Regarding your scenario of 100 colluding MN's, even if that were to happen, they still wouldn't get any useful information. MN's are picked pseudo-randomly - there are algorithms in place that selects MN's based on age and other metrics that prevent gaming the system, and since there's around 4800 masternodes, the odds of collusion leading to any useful information are astronomically low. And as I stated earlier, once you hit the second round of mixing, the history has already been erased, and each round makes tracing a PS address \*exponentially\* more difficult. You are more likely to be deanonymized in Monero with a cross chain analysis comparing ring signature decoys. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:57:08
No, that's not correct. They don't have any privileged information. Dash PS first takes your PS balance and breaks it down into a series of commonly denominated addresses. Then for *each* one of those addresses, inputs are swapped with two other users on the network. Then this process repeats based on the number of mixing rounds you select. At best, during the first round of mixing, a MN could learn the originating address for just one of your hundreds of mixed addresses, but since the minimum number of rounds of mixing is two (and is scheduled to be increased to four with the next update), it's impossible for a MN not in the first round to know the originating address. 
It's not like you have 5 Dash and mix all 5 at once with a single masterndode. You actually end up mixing hundreds of addresses, each through a randomly selected masternode.
