I had just shy of 2 Bitcoin at one point and I was still anxious of having them in an unsecured wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-16 17:24:10
Well, it's not that much but I'm not sure you would get the money on your account by the 20th with a new account. You should ask around though, I'm not very knowledgeable on this given I've never sold large amount of coins at once.
@_date: 2016-04-17 11:01:06
I'll just throw 200 bucks in  just in case
@_date: 2016-04-16 16:59:15
It depends on the exchange you use to sell your bitcoins, I assume. A sizeable payment is likely to take some time, though.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:00:16
It feels like a high entry point, to be honest.

No, it was a brand new one.

@_date: 2015-01-18 15:46:32
I'd say localbitcoin or virwox are the easiest and safest ways. Both have high fees as most exchanges / sellers dislike Paypal for their refund policy but eh, bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:23:56
It looked pretty legit. I want to buy using a credit card outside of the US.
Apart from Virwox and its incredible fees, its the only one I found that actually did look ok.
Had some feedback on bitcointalk, mostly positive but not enough to make my mind.
If you know where I can buy Bitcoins, feel free to tell me.
Are you positive about this being a scam ? They asks for a lot of ID and checks, which isn't really the case usually.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:30:55

Maybe just maybe you do have 500 btc on it. How does it feel ?

@_date: 2015-01-17 08:58:40
As I said on another thread, most of the people here are in a complete loss mindset and/or true believer in the Bitcoin potential.
It's really impressive how people having invested so much are so confident and positive
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:37:41
Nah I meant imagine if someone sent btc to one of your lost wallet by mistake, you'd never know.
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:26:37
I've found [Virwox]( where you're allowed to buy Linden Dollar and then trade it for Bitcoins. 
It takes some fee but hey, better than nothing.
I'll try it later
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:40:26
Yeah, I got that, you just catched my curiosity. 
Why not tell tho? I never got why peoples here are so reluctant to share anything when it comes to things like lost coins. Is there any reason ?
However I respect your choice. This is an honest question, not some sort of sarcasm
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:14:29
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:43:18
I guess so. Now I'm afraid to use it. But goddamn I spent so much time searching for a site taking credit cards :(
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:53:08
Yet he's right, you know?
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:00:33
Thanks! Finally someone cool and welcoming. I think the main reason why peoples don't use Bitcoins more is because of the community.
Like, I am new to this and I get the  "you should have planned" kind of useless comment all the time (nothing personal but that's pretty much it, I knew that and it didn't help me so..well). Yeah I failed but instead of the nice and helping community I always thought I'd be part of amongst other Bitcoin users...it's actually pretty far from it.
So, keep posting messages like that. I really appreciated some encouragement and advice in my Bitcoin Quest!
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:11:21
I'm on phone atm but somewhere on the website you mention a credit card service provider I didn't find anywhere on the web.
Edit : Indeed there is a list on the PCI official website. Wtf, do you think a logo is enough to prove you're certified?
Will check the screenshot later

On the **PCI** website. I haven't been able to found 247exchanges nor "Intermoney" anywhere there and am still waiting for an answer from the "tech support". Does it take 5+ days to send a customer a proof of this certification ? *
I believe it wouldn't even need "tech support", how is this related ?
If there isn't such list on the web, anyone can supposedly claim to be certified by PCI and put a .png ont the bottom on their site ?
By the way, the credit card operating service mentioned in the FAQ does not exist.

Again, I did compare your point. I couldn't care less about whether you are a teenager or not, or whether you think that's an insult. The point you made made me think of that because they are obviously similar, and I brought it up. Don't blame it on me, blame it on the logical fallacy in your own comment.

The PCI. Got a response from PCI saying if it was certified it would show up on their website. So yeah, two new comments  in a few minutes, both positive towards the site and coming from fairly new accounts that talk about this website in multiple threads.
Avoid this service and use Virwox instead guys. Or, consider your money potentially lost.

Most people I talk with are skeptics of course. Even myself when I first heard of btc. But being a skeptic and wanting it to fail of out spite because you didn't buy in are two different things. I'm not saying this isn't the case for some people, but let's not picture everyone out of this sub that way. This isn't a circlejerk, and we can't dismiss anything they say because "they're just jealous".

@_date: 2016-01-14 17:20:17

@_date: 2015-01-13 23:52:10
Initially I was just going to buy something with it but once I bought the exchange manually verified the transaction and there I was already losing 10%. So I thought I might see how it goes and well...here I am
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:30:56
I don't have to prove you wrong, and you can't prove that you're right. You're just making baseless assumptions, that you're now even backing by the fact that you're being upvoted? Sounds circlejerk-y. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:40:39
Below 1usd? Are you crazy ?
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:05:00
No, I understood it perfectly. But your argument is so far-fetched it honestly is ridiculous. It's like saying "oh these guys critizice so-and-so because they're jealous!!!111". I've seen that used by teenagers to defend their favorites actors or whatever, and it always make me smile. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:45:10
Fuck I'd sell 50% and hold the rest right. To moon or nowhere.
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:52:45
No actually you are right for the most parts but it still look like a low-end troll
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:54:11
What I meant is you are being ridiculous, as in [absurd / illogical]( It's definitely not an insult, such as if I called you dumb or anything. 
I compared your point to the one some teenagers are making about their favourite popstars. Even if I did in fact compare you to a teenager, what's bad about that? 


Oh now you're trying to frame yourself as a victim of my "attacks" ? Won't work here buddy. I'm just arguing with you, if you can't take it or if your feelings are hurt because of it, maybe you shouldn't be on the Internet in the first place.
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:22:14
Of course it's not. I was being sarcastic because most medias still depict bitcoin as a money laundering machine and nothing else. How can you be so dense to think I'm actually implying someone getting his own admittedly rightfully owned money is laundering it??

@_date: 2017-01-11 11:05:30
So you do account for it's price. It's normal that everyone does in the actual state of things. It can be used as a mean of exchange, but the fact that it depends entirely on other currencies means it's not "real" money. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:47:45
And those bitcoins are instantly sold for actual real money which have value on their own instead of relying on other currencies
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:52:32
So, if it's money to you, it has a certain value for exchanges of good and services, regardless of Bitcoin's price at the time? What's your fixed bitcoin salary? 2 bitcoins? 3?
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:35:45
Your dad is probably unsignificant in the economy. As far as I'm aware, no major business (except bitcoin related) choose that option. It's just not worth the risk. And if you pay suppliers with it, it's still considering the market price of btc. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:07:49
This is my kind of shitposts.

Objectively it's always wrong too.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:14:22
Bitpay still does. Most major companies use Bitpay. So they actually never even hold any btc.
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:46:44
Only because it's much more convenient. Real money isn't instantly converted to another (usd or euro) when used. It has some value on its own. As things stand, Bitcoin isn't real money. I wish it was, but it's just not the case. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:17:49
not really. They're not desesperate for anything. They probably can make safe 10% roi and live off half that each year
@_date: 2016-06-04 08:30:42
The price has to do with supply and demand, that's it. If buyers consider the block size isn't high enough, it might lower the demand, hence making the price fall.

Well I'm sure we don't realize yet. It has created opportunities, changed lives and views on how the economy could or should work for some people, created a community, etc.
I wouldn't quite say it has changed the world as much as the Internet but hey Bitxoin is only 6 years old. It sure has potential, unlike Katy Perry
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:38:38

I've deleted my other comment by mistake. I wanted to add that most of the time this situation is caused by the bad usb cable they ship with the trezor, so this is pretty weird. Although Electrum has apparently been known for having an issue with trezors in an earlier version, it should be fixed now. :/

247 is a bit shady. Plus the confirmations they ask for is ridiculous. A spanish person barely speaking english called me on my phone to verify it and at the end of the day the cc service wasn't even working.
Would not recommend

What's the point? Peoples smart enough are able to spot that "wallet.rar" isn't really your wallet and is most likely a virus. And once you download it, being smart or not doesn't matter that much.
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:30:44
Honestly, shit like this is keeping Bitcoin from becoming mainstream. It's just so freaking hard to buy bitcoins in trusted exhanges. That and the ridiculous amount of time it takes to verify a transaction.

It won't reach wide adoption just because it has an independant infrastructure tho. Indeed what we do is not important, that's my point. The money brings in new peoples: miners, investors, traders, and wannabe millionaires. Eventually some of these are convinced of Bitcoin's potential and that's it.
Yes sure you can convince some peoples to get into it but let's face it what part of the trading volume do they represent ? 5%?
I'm afraid profit is what keeps Bitcoin alive.
@_date: 2016-05-28 08:41:09
Yeah, would've surprised me, but at least it's something! Let us know how you fix it eventually, I'm curious about this

Would the price be higher than now ? Nothing doesn't necessarily mean losing the whole original investment, but at least a part of it. Nothing = no profit

That's crazy and very interesting. I can only picture peoples with low buy orders waking up to see it was fulfilled haha

Last I heard usage and usefulness weren't the same
I'm just so tired of talking through texts, it takes so much more time than a short call to plan something or discuss.
Texts are convenient. Calls are efficient.

I was browsing bitcoin charts for fun (yes, really) and happened to see that. I zoomed on it and was kinda stunned. It goes so low that it's *not making it on the screen*. Was that a big dump? Error?

@_date: 2015-02-19 17:00:45
Sure bitcoin's price is determined by the market but such is ANY other good or asset. Would you call gold "a pyramid scheme" because if peoples stopped buying it it would be worth jack shit? Of course not because it has been proven as a reliable asset. Bitcoin hasn't quite yet but you get the point.
Please feel free to educate yourself about what a pyramid / ponzi scheme is before talking nonsense (and more or less blurt out what you read on buttcoin)

It's doctor Evil from Austin Powers. I'm on phone, I can't link you to it, but feel free to search for "one million dollar doctor evil" on YouTube and you'll find the scene for sure. Also, great movie. Definitely worth it.

@_date: 2015-02-25 08:58:08
I mean yeah how do we get it to work then? Do we create a sect and pray Satoshi everyday while tricking more people in joining us in our Bitcoin quest? For something like Bitcoin to work, it needs profits at some point because guess what, we're living in a system based upon it (profit, not bitcoins (yet)).
I'm not gonna lie, I was into Bitcoins because I heard of it at its peak and the first thing that came to my mind was that if I went ahead and bought for 1000$ at the very beginning like I had thought I'd do, I'd have been sitting on millions atm. (I was serious about it but my knowledge was limited so I gave up because I didn't find a way to do so that looked safe)
So yeah I'm hodling half a bitcoin for the gamble but that doesn't mean I'm not enthousiast about its capacities
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:23:43

@_date: 2015-02-02 16:46:19
Oh. I thought we were talking online dark markets. I don't see bitcoins being used for real life black markets. I don't know how big it is online so I have no clue about the price if it was adopted there.

Buy half a Bitcoin. Learn about market trading. Enjoy. Maybe make some profit, but consider you're potentially losing it all at the very moment you bought.
If you can stand that, go ahead and try :)
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:54:21
Nice to see you finally got it
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:03:40
Could. But how likely is it ? Tbh, I really can't picture it. Why do you consider bitcoins to be safer and more efficient than fiat?
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:29:59
I swear I did read that somewhere tho. Maybe it was all a dream
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:05:37
I guess they so that in extreme cases where one has been acting strange? Doesn't make it totally ok but at least it's not systematic

@_date: 2015-02-02 18:06:18
Well Bitcoin price might fall too. Much more likely than suitcases of cash being stolen because those are usually protected.
Also, the price wouldn't skyrocket as most users of black market are probable not interested in hodling coins (demand / offer are balanced)
