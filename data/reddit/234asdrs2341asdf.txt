True I think eventually bitcoin will stabilize as well. I also think that there are basic mechanisms that might stabilize bitcoin. For example, I could see large investors perhaps attempting to control the price of bitcoin by buying or selling based on specific prices. For example buying at $295 and then selling at $296. The price would be "locked" into that range assuming the trader continues their strategy. However, you would probably still get large movements every now and then.

Because you can't use bitcoin if the price is constantly changing. I'm talking about for small transactions that you would go to a physical store to buy. Just look at what happens in the real world when fiat currencies fall into hyperinflation. The merchants have to constantly change the price and eventually they just close the shop until the fiat stabilizes.

Really good paper, I'll read it.

I hate to say it but this feature is a must. Without this feature, you'll probably get scammers and criminals flooding the marketplace with crap.

Awesome, I'll check out nuBits

You put your bitcoins in a bank that lends them out, lol. It could work, in theory, but probably in practice the borrowers would just default because enforcement of the loans would be difficult. The loans could be enforced using traditional court systems though.
The only reason the existing banking system works (depositors depositing and banks lending) is because the taxpayer agrees to guarantee deposits up to 250k with FDIC. Maybe FDIC should also guarantee bitcoin deposits?

Yeah I agree that bitcoin has advantages over bitcoin but m-pesa also has advantages over bitcoin. One of them being that the m-pesa is basically stable. The price volatility definitely makes doing business in bitcoin difficult. I think it would be smart to create some sort of decentralized system that is pegged to the dollar and could be integrated into the bitcoin system or allow for cross communication between both protocols. That's the only benefit I see with traditional fiat is that it is stable over the short-term. 
Then we could do business in this other currency and convert back and forth between the two (perhaps on a decentralized exchange?). 
It almost seems like this new decentralized currency would need some sort of decentralized mechanism to stabilize the price (as strange as that sounds). It is interesting to think about from a theoretical stand point.

By abundant I mean relative to the amount we use.

If we keep this up soon we will be the 1%!!!

I guess. Well I don't believe that the effects of a deflationary economy will be as devastating as we imagine for the simple fact that in the future computers will drastically change the way we do business. Personally I think the effects of deflation can be priced in, calculated and accounted for. Most of our current models are basically telling us that everything falls to shit when inflation/deflation occurs. Just because we thought the world was flat in the old days doesn't mean it is an absolute truth. Perhaps our current models are outdated. I know a lot of the inflation/deflation theories are heavily based on how people react.

The loan could be structured to adjust for it. For example, the lender could agree to only accept 90% of the loan value if the value of the bitcoins increase in value. So if the price of bitcoin rises the borrower wouldn't necessarily be screwed since they would get their loan payments reduced. You could also setup the entire loan to be dynamically adjusted through the usage of a predetermined algorithm. Maybe the loan could be setup to state that the lender wants the entire "principal" back + 10%. The amount of the principal repayment would be determined by an algorithm based on inflation/deflation over the course of the loan.
Look up a type of security called TIPS. It is similar to what I am talking about. Explained below:

Seriously. At one point I was big into gold/silver. Even bought a decent amount of silver. Plus it didn't help that the coins were fun to look at it, hold, count etc. But then I eventually realized that silver was just like any other trinket. Sure you can make electronics out of it or jewelry but at the end of the day it is just a metal. A metal which despite what supports say, is still abundant and every day we mine more and more. So the whole idea of it being "precious" is quite an illusion. I ended up selling most of it for about the same price I bought it for. I only kept a few american silver eagles.
Now that we have bitcoin, I don't ever see people using gold/silver as a form of money in any significant amount. I view them only as industrial or scientific metals.

Actually there is a lot of risk with bitcoin. Obviously there is no guarantee that bitcoin will increase in value. It has a lot of risk factors. Maybe it will just float in the $300 range for the next 10 years. Who knows. With the loan idea, I think there are bigger issues.

Very interesting, thanks for the response. Will definitely look into the zap go website.

I agree those are other advantages of bitcoin; being global and less "middleman" fees so to speak. We all know that Vodafone is a greedy corporation like all of the rest but I think there is definitely valuable insight into looking to see why m-pesa has grown to where it has gone. 
M-pesa is easy to use
M-pesa runs on even old versions of phones
M-pesa is easy to exchange for (85,000 exchange agents)
M-pesa is accepted by virtually everyone in the country
M-pesa price is pegged to the shilling (price stability).
All of those are attributes that the average joe wants.
