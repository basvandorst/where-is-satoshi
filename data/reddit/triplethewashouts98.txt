1. What OP what saying is that when an artist has completed an album he holds it ransom for his fans to collectively bid on its release. If it gets well over funded then there will be some fans who might have paid for instant gratification but didnt want to fund it because of the crowfunding delay, but then again the artist got the fair market value of his work, so consider it a small cost as opposed to all the fans who would otherwise not pay at all because they knew under the normal distribution methods and piracy that it would become freely available. On the other hand if the project is at 90% funding then you will see a glut of fans appear who may have not originally paid for the album fund it just to make it available, the use of campaign timers have been shown to be massively successful in forcing consumers hands. Overall it is a win for the artist. 
2. The market on digital content isnt 100% controlled by piracy, judging from the massive profitability reported by RIAA and MPAA groups its not that big of a problem at all. Why doesnt everyone pirate? Some think of it as stealing, some like to impulse buy, some like to support the system that brought it to them, others simply dont know how to pirate or its too much work. Not only is setting a campaign limit not "capping their potential revenue" as evident by the massive overfunding of many crowdfunding campaigns to-date, but this cross-section of people who make up the majority of digital content consumers will purchase something that they could otherwise steal. 


Lack of business acumen? Unwillingness to try something new? Not enough of a following? It just didnt occur to them? Or maybe they're locked in a contract that would in no cold-hell let them bypass their distributors extortive profit model.
