No. Have you heard of opportunity cost? The idea is there is more to the price than just the action. Choosing to conform to Apple means not only having to trust a company with history of abusing its customers. It also means you can't use any of the payment alternatives they've unilaterally prevented from appearing in your Apple device's App Store, most famously BTC clients. This is the 'big seam' I alluded to. When you commit to Apple, it's not just to a payment platform, or a phone, it's to the ecosystem, and most people don't realize its high cost until they're invested in it.

Apple makes millions of 'profit' off the ignorant, and hundreds of millions off the willfully ignorant. "unfounded" proves you to be in the later, especially when I gave you everything you needed.
Now that I'm at a computer, how about [you watch this]( and then tell me apple's corporate policies regarding IP are just "cnn buzzwords".

Also, payments within the apple ecosystem are only 'seamless' once you get over the massive seam that is complete and utter devotion to the corporate strongarming that Apple does. In short, swallowing the pill that you don't own an Apple product, Apple owns you.

Look at you assuming I give a flying fuck if I didn't convince a fanboy to recall the company's many recent policies that prevent competition on their platform. Go ahead and buy in, you deserve each other.

I forgot I'm not posting in where people are a bit more informed. So I'll do your research for you: antennagate, coinbase, and Android's zero switching cost, respectively. And if you cry about this answer you're only going to get LMGTFY links from me.

I'm hard pressed for coming up with a reason why the concept of a decimal point escaped her.

Also "the lesser evil" is not a concept that resonates with libertarian practice.

logical extension of going higher, like the value?

Awesome tutorial. Didn't know about that Google QR code generator, that's convenient! And the websocket example is great. Not sure what else useful is available in the API but curious to find out.

Indeed. $10k is conservative for a mass adoption scenario.

The biggest thing will be letting people use their IRAs to invest almost directly in BTC. They're a perfect match, and demand should spike considerably since right now the best you can do is a trust.

Because the narrative that the investment banker presents is the most commonly used one to disparage its value.

I was curious, so I clicked the link. Then I had to kinda navigate around a bit to find anything about investing. So follow this link to save yourself that trouble:

Cool, thanks for the information.

Well, your original post was about investing, so I expected the link to be too. If you were posting to a thread about gaming or gambling, I would've been content with your front page link. 
Everything seems on the up-and-up conceptually, though there's some trust involved that would be best assisted by some testimonials. 
Having just started getting into ethereum, it made me think how much safer it would be as a potential investor if shares in your casino were it's own ethereum smart contract.
Can you provide user growth figures / MAU / drop off rate?
