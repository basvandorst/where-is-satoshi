I was thinking rather that they were referring to the monopolies (plural) in each of the government-fiat currencies: the right to issue money in each currency is vested in a monopoly. With Bitcoin, there's no such monopoly: anyone who can round up enough hashing power can "legally" issue coins.

@_date: 2016-08-28 22:22:12
I meant that we don't unavoidably need Bitcoin for any of these things. If cheap transactions is what you want from a currency, Bitcoin isn't what you need - it isn't optimized (or even arguably designed) for that. Security? Well I don't know, but the apparent inevitability of getting hacked if you're a Bitcoin-using site seems to suggest the same: you don't need Bitcoin if security is what you want. Bitcoin's privacy offering also isn't *that* amazeballs, but yes, if liberty is what you want, at least that's what Bitcoin is designed for.
But convenience? Anyone who thinks Bitcoin's priority should be "convenience" should GTFO and stick to Visa or whatever equivalent alternative they have.

Trying to trade yourself out of insolvency is exactly such a thing. *As soon as* you become aware that you're insolvent, you need to file for bankruptcy protection. That's why it's called bankruptcy *protection*. If you fail to do that, you're no longer protected from creditors going after your (the directors') personal assets.

L2 protocols aren't about merely doubling the number of transactions that can benefit from the Bitcoin network. Tommy doesn't need to pay $20 for each ride. He might only need to pay $20 once a month, or in an extreme case only once in a lifetime (if at all).
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:34:24


Non sequitur. In fact, it's simply false. If the L2 protocol gets settled to the blockchain only very rarely, then on-chain transaction fees can be high while the L2 protocol is still affordable to access.

Yeah, this is my (totally lay) opinion too. Unilaterally applying a haircut to everyone seems a lot like trying to trade themselves out of an insolvent position.

As far as I understand it Ethereum Classic's history hasn't been edited - that's the whole point of it, no? There's no editing to be noticed because it didn't happen on that chain. That's different from editing history *secretly*.
Anyway, my claim wasn't that 51% attackers *have to* edit history, merely that they can do so without being ignored. They operate within the existing consensus rules, unlike the bailout-Ethereum. But even if they do (51% attackers editing history), they can't hide that fact. (What they could do secretly is censoring history in real time - but not (long) after the fact.)

Yes, and this is the natural state of free software. The people who have the most to gain from LN have an incentive to put in the work to figure out how to use it before Mom and Dad can just install a thing and click some mouse buttons. We'll eventually get the Mom and Dad-friendly versions too, but that will happen incrementally as the earlier adopters that are able to, add UI features that make their particular workflows significantly easier. That effort will cascade down over time until all the 99th-percentile use cases are covered.

That they're deployed as softforks with version bits etc. is really a favour the miners are doing for the community. (I'm not saying they're doing this altruistically; just that they don't technically *need* to tell us what the softforked rules even are.)

Nobody needs permission to contribute.  Anyone may contribute. Your claims to the contrary are on their face wrong.




Bullshit. Consensus compatibility is very clearly defined. There's no true scotsman fallacy here. You can't just throw out random fallacy names with an equal signs and have that constitute an argument.


Sure there is such a thing. A contribution in the form of a patch that increases the current block subsidy back to 25 BTC would be consensus-incompatible. As would a block size increase patch.


"Consensus system" is a technical term, with a specific technical meaning:
Simply extending the Bitcoin blockchain with invalid blocks does not establish consensus. It violates it.


Yes, the Bitcoin Core codebase is centralized in some fairly trivial ways.


No, nobody needs their permission to contribute. If you want your contribution *accepted* then that's another matter, but even there you're not on as strong a footing as you seem to think. Anyone with a worthwhile contribution might have their contribution accepted. I'm not aware of *even a single contribution* that wasn't accepted purely due to the identity of the contributor.

False. Anyone may contribute.
Not every contribution gets accepted though. Sometimes because those contributions are just shit; other times because the contribution concerned addresses an issue that has other contributions lined up that the devs consider superior.
That's just for consensus-compatible contributions. Consensus-incompatible contributions (like increasing block "size" (as in, size sans segwit data)) get rejected because they're *consensus-incompatible*.

They learn nothing that they wouldn't also be able to learn if you didn't batch your transactions. Batching increases the anonymity set of the transaction, which means batching allows *more* privacy, not less. The information that gets deleted (granting privacy) by batching is the timing of individual withdrawals. With batched withdrawals, the NSA has to work a little harder to correlate your Internet traffic to your exchange with a particular transaction output. They'd probably have to have a tentacle *inside* the exchange, rather than merely having to eavesdrop the traffic at an intermediate point.

The extant Bitcoin network. That means the network of *validating nodes*; miners are just a sideshow if they don't validate (which I've seen rumours of them not doing).


Simply computing the PoW witness does not suffice. If the block is invalid for any other reason, it's as good as invisible to the Bitcoin network. Think about it: a bitcoin miner could try to extend the Litecoin chain, and they could utterly dominate in terms of kWh expended on their pseudo-Litecoin blocks, yet still have those blocks be summarily ignored because they're *invalid*. Because they compute the wrong data.

In the short term it's a substitution we're looking at rather than an addition. You don't get to just build 500GW of extra capacity in a year. Maybe not even in 5.

I don't. On what do you base this prediction? It seems utterly bizarre to me - I don't see any strong incentive for miners to become strong players in the lightning network, and by the way did you know that anybody who wants to can set up a node in the Lightning network? You don't need anyone's permission to do so, so the market for routing over LN is likely to be nearly perfectly competitive. I don't see miners having any cost advantage here. They might be able to open and close channels "for free", except that it isn't really "free" if it comes at the cost of not taking fees from transactions not their own.

If quantum computers suddenly appear making it possible to mine blocks every 15 seconds at current difficulty (and dominate the network hash rate), then the network will adjust difficulty in at most 8 hours 24 minutes, to re-establish the 10-minute block cadence.

That's a very imperfect "perfect solution". Joe wants the road to cut through Bob's land, and Bob wants the road to cut through Joe's land. If Bob has more money than Joe, maybe he can get the road to cut through Joe's land, but then we've injured Joe - *forced* him to accept the road cutting his land into two pieces. That isn't qualitatively better than the system we have now in most jurisdictions: Eminent Domain type laws that allow the state to just decide and (usually) compensate the "losing" landowner for their loss.

There is a wide variety of views. Some categorically dismiss any utility of taxes, other's are just fine with them.

I think you're confusing two senses of the word "consensus".

I weakly hold this as a strong opinion, but IMHO Bitcoin, as a decentralized currency (taking an optimistic long-term perspective) is antithetical to centralized "foundations" advocating for it. I don't think it's a problem for organizations here and there advocating for it per se, but it becomes a problem when they do it while aspiring to *authority*. Especially unearned authority, and in the Bitcoin Foundation's case I think they tried to grasp at that by wearing suits and worshipping the sacred *legitimacy* cow.

A word isn't copyrightable. It may be subject to trademark law. And trademark law doesn't forbid *all* use of a trademarked term. But you're introducing red herrings now; laws don't determine whether people counterfeit goods; whether it's profitable to do does.


Uniqueness isn't enough. You need *resistance to copying* (whether legal or not). By anyone.
In one sense your word is perpetually unique, in the same sense that there is only one number "42". But then what matters isn't the exact identity of your token, but the *class* it forms part of. The question of scarcity then hinges around how hard it is to find *other* members of that class. I can make up other unique words and no trademark law will stop that, but you can't make up arbitrary Bitcoin UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) that other people will accept (which is the class relevant to bitcoin-scarcity) without proving their provenance in the blockchain.
Gold's scarcity is anchored in the fact that we know of no more productive way of finding new gold atoms than by digging them out of the ground. Pretty much all the elemental substances are like this, and the only difference in their scarcity is how much of the stuff there is around us. They could all be used as money, if we chose, but some are more and some less-well suited to this task. We don't want to cart around wheelbarrows of iron, so we don't use that as our money.

Re-read my comment. I listed those as classic examples of public goods.
But there's variation in how hard it is to imagine each of those classically public goods as private goods.
* A justice system: ancap / libertarian types like to talk about "polycentric law systems", and imagine "dispute resolution organizations" that people could voluntarily opt into. Personally I don't think this would be stable (I think it would disproportionate into some number of sovereign territories, just like the countries we have now), but it is imaginable.
* Roads can be built privately. Some already are - toll roads (dramatic, but not quite purely private), and farm roads are examples. It's possible to exclude non-paying users: you simply don't lift the gate for them.
* Military defence: imaginable as insurance industry coalitions. Insurance companies would insure your business against foreign invasion, and then they'd invest in tanks and jets to reduce the risk of that happening. 
* Telecommunications: you could have fiber optic networks spanning the country and let only paying users access them. Almost like... today!

AFAIK the "bit" is a micro-bitcoin, and at current prices is indeed a somewhat everyday-plausible unit, pretty close to being on par with one US cent.
When I was small (around 6/7, early 1980s) we still had a half-cent here in South Africa. It was worth more then compared to other currencies than it would be now (at face value anyway), but today that would be about 2 satoshis. I think you could buy a bubblegum with a half-cent.

Yes, but that's shifting from *items themselves* being "scarce goods", to their provenance being what you value.


Because you haven't established a category for particular pieces of paper whose exemplars are credibly scarce.
You need to get away from particular items and concentrate on *categories* to reason about scarcity coherently. Otherwise everything is "scarce", because there's only one of every physical item.

The way I understand it, even that doesn't require a hard fork. Most recently the segregated witness proposal [\*] forms an example of how to do things that smell like a hard fork, with only a soft fork.
But yes, just like human brains still have the proverbial reptile brain embedded with all the old glitchy mechanisms preserved (but worked around at higher layers), this soft fork approach wouldn't address "reptile-Bitcoin's" bugs. It might just not matter except code-aesthetically.

I tend to believe that censorship resistance hinges on the ability of random *individuals* to host full nodes. Companies are far fewer in number than random individuals are (whether they run Bitcoin nodes or not) and have less tolerance for "irrational" behaviour and hence are much easier to pull into line with laws that are anathema to Bitcoin's ethos. Getting random individuals to apply address blacklists would be like herding cats; getting companies to do the same is much easier - the company will even work against itself if it were to attempt to go against any such blacklist law. Your shareholders would sue you if they found out you weren't applying the blacklist.

All transaction outputs ultimately derive from coinbase outputs. That's part of what it means for a coin to be valid. There's no other source of coins other than the block rewards. To each side of a fork, some of the coins of the other side don't exist: they don't derive only from valid coinbase outputs. And invalidity spreads, it doesn't extinguish: each output of a transaction with even one invalid input, is itself invalid.
The blockchain is a strictly linear data structure: each block has exactly one parent block (other than perhaps the genesis block). If you somehow forced the code to accept a block with more than one parent (requiring a hardfork to allow this), then you would have multiple block rewards for a given block number (although "block number" gets ambiguous if you allow multiple parents), and you'd have to think what that means for the ~21M issuance limit.
If you're lucky, the coinbase outputs from the fork don't get spent (and they're unspendable for 100 blocks after their generation). "Merging" the fork in that case consists of extinguishing those coinbase outputs, which is exactly what orphaning does.

There's also human-level consensus which is as you describe, and a more tech jargon version of the word which has a specific technical meaning that's relevant in Bitcoin. It relates to different nodes on the network being able to compute the same state (the UTXO set) despite seeing different (and sometimes conflicting!) orderings of input. If you undermine this process by having some subset of nodes computing the consensus using different rules, then the network as a whole fails to reach consensus - a fork (and it's irreconcileable without going meta and human-level resolving it by making one side forget it ever existed).
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:05:00


It doesn't harm consensus-the-technical-term. There's no disagreement about the computed state; in fact the states of different cryptocurrencies are *independent*. What it does harm is consensus-the-social-phenomenon, "stealing" a little bit of the network effect that makes a currency useful.

Absolutely. Altcoins are just a feedback response of a system that sees a high rate of growth as an opportunity to expand into. When you expand a cylinder containing water, at first the air above the water expands, but then as you reach the vapour pressure of the water, the pressure no longer drops as the water just boils off into more vapour. Altcoins are like the vapour boiling off the Bitcoin water.

All you achieve with such an ultimatum is a rush for the exits.

There's an externality here. Miners don't pay for the full cost of storing and transmitting a block throughout the network.

We had helicopters well before the times when "everyone knew" that we'd have flying cars in the future.
The point I snarkily tried to make is that technological progress isn't automatic. It isn't the default. And it also doesn't always go in the direction you might think it would, if you judged only by the past. For example. even if Moore's law continues to hold, it doesn't necessarily lead to ubiquitous TB RAM and THz processing; it could also lead instead to smaller, cheaper devices that have the same *or even less* processing power than today's devices. The *density* of transistors may increase, but that doesn't mean that the *absolute number* of transistors in any one class of device must also increase at the same rate.

Merely having value does not require (on-chain) securing. The only thing that needs securing is *changes* to the ledger. Mining can stop tomorrow and all your bitcoin will still be yours forever. It's only if you want to trade them that you need that trade secured.

If it turns out that a decentralized currency network cannot maintain consensus on who owns how much of it, then the experiment that is cryptocurrency is a failure. This isn't about scarcity, or about altcoins, but about (computational) consensus. If even the most serious attempt we've had at a distributed cryptocurrency turns out to fragment, then that undermines the hope that we can wrest control of our money from governments and suggests that we do, after all, "need" governments to declare money by fiat, that we can't be trusted to manage it ourselves.
Altcoins at least have an identity distinct from Bitcoin, so they don't harm Bitcoin consensus. You can't spend your litecoin on the Bitcoin network. You can spend your pre-hardfork (and maybe even slightly post-fork) bitcoin on either side of a chain fork.

If Gavin and Mike had instead endorsed some altcoin (or even just started a new one) they could have had some serious traction by now. We probably would have had an exchange between it and Bitcoin already. But no, we have to force this square peg into a round hole, just to cling to having the Bitcoin genesis block in the blockchain, as if the identity of the currency we use were important.
There are even altcoins that are arguably more versatile than Bitcoin! Maybe better anonymity, smarter contracts, more fungibility. Why not pick one of them as the cultural successor to Bitcoin?

It isn't just fewer miners, but fewer full nodes. Now, many people can casually run a full node, because storing a 15GB blockchain isn't much of an issue for them. These casual full nodes add to the security of the network, because they participate in the consensus of what is and isn't valid, and they also censor bad transactions from the flood algorithm (they don't relay fee-less dust transactions, for example).
If you increase the demands on these casual users, they'll start leaving the network, leaving it more concentrated. Heck, I'm the frothing-at-the-mouth bitcoin advocate in some of my social circles, and I already can't run bitcoind 24/7 even though I'd like to, because it'd eat my monthly data cap in three days.
As for miners (and I think in this context it means pool operators rather than their outsourced compute nodes) in particular, bigger blocks will place higher demands on their connectivity. If you can't get your mined blocks out to the rest of the network fast, yours will get orphaned more often than those of other, better-connected miners.

All these people saying "should have used halon / immersion cooling / whatever" are acting like you can just throw money at this with no consequence. But this isn't web hosting or cloud backups or whatever. This is different - it's Bitcoin. It's *designed* to make mining exactly economically neutral, in the long term, at equilibrium. So it's a race to find the scrappiest, cheapest miner farm so that one can be just one epsilon more efficient than the rest of the Bitcoin mining industry. Along the way, some people will overstep, like we see here, but I don't think we should expect to see setups with 20°C ambient, raised floors, halon systems and the like, as a norm.
The purpose of fire suppression in a mining farm wouldn't be just to suppress any and all fires, but to do so *without making mining unprofitable*.

The definitions of "rape" might be different in parts of the world, but I submit you're still gonna have a hard time if you're caught raping some guy's daughter, sister, or whatever. And maybe in those parts of the world the crime you committed would be considered more like a property crime than as an assault. That's an important thing to note if we were talking about gender issues, but it doesn't change the fact that they probably have a crime whose name translates more or less to "rape" in English, and that they consider it evil. In the West we consider theft evil too, right?


Interesting question. I don't think so; at least, not when you judge them within their social context. They have different values and rules than I do, and as much as I dislike the outcomes of their world, I think it's presumptuous to judge them according to my own values. Just like it's presumptuous to judge a dolphin for "raping" his mate.
If we want to impose our rules on others, we either have to accept that we're being (benevolent? who decides that?) fascists, or win them over somehow. The latter is what happens when a guy from Afghanistan or wherever comes to Europe - he's then subject to European values and the rules that follow from them.
This is an unfinished line of thinking BTW; you can probably find holes in it.


I think states (and statists) simply accept that they are fascists at some level? They think of themselves as benevolent, of course. And if you don't like it, "you can move" (except men with guns might prevent you from leaving, or from entering another place).

That does not by itself guarantee that prices of goods will be declining. If the velocity of money is increasing at the same time (as I think is likely as markets become more efficient) then the prices of goods could be decreasing, staying about the same, or rising. Also, if you want prices dropping at anything like an appreciable rate, I think you'll need rising economic output if you aren't already in a deflationary spiral, no? If economic output is dropping (normally, not in spiral-mode), don't you think prices will be *rising* as an approximately constant supply of money chases a shrinking amount of goods and services?

It was 2106, and it had been a few years since the money supply had increased by a full bitcoin, the original unit. They often joked about how people back in 2010 paid 10000 bitcoin for pizza, where now even a single one would be enough to live off comfortably. Back in 2010 most people also had access to their private keys, enabling them to spend their money anonymously. Private keys are the informational precursors to the [immovable tokens]( that stored the majority of the global wealth of 2106.
Before the Last War, the ideological war to end all ideological wars, during which all computers became permanently inoperable, humans could compute "addresses" from these private keys, and use these "addresses" as places to receive payments. By 2106 money was publicly owned, with symbolic representations of bitcoin addresses chiselled into stone disks. Everybody living near such a disk knew who owned that wealth, enabling secure transactions by the owner publicly declaring transfer of ownership to another person. The new consensus would transmit from the multiple witnesses (people would only trust word-of-mouth transfers if the majority of people they knew already either witnessed the transfer or themselves already believed that a majority consensus had formed) to those who weren't present, through a gossip protocol that spread the news as quickly as was possible. The private keys had long been inaccessible, exist as they might in a mathematical sense. One would say "forgotten" if anyone but a few eccentrics of the early days had ever remembered them in the first place. In fact, most of the 21 million bitcoin that could ever exist became inaccessible during the Last War, leaving only those stored in "paper wallets" at the time able to be embodied in stone disks.
But the reality of 2106 was that nobody knew, or could know, the private keys that backed most of the world's wealth. It was the stone disks' bulk, their immobility, that made double-spending all but impossible. That all changed in the autumn, when an old man named [Dorian, after his great grandfather]( finally completed a project his ancestor had started 84 years earlier.
Word spread quickly: the Satoshi coins had moved! Dorian's (and his fathers, and his father's in turn) persistence and thousands of pencils had finally paid off. The multi-generational family project to recover the partially burned paper wallet had taken many, many years of systematically trying every possible combination that the missing pixels of the QR code could have taken, manually converting everything to a private key and thence to an address. The process had been just like the block mining operations of the time: mountains of pencil-filled paper, the vast majority of pages absolutely worthless. But that one day, 95 years after the house fire, the 100-odd pages that Dorian filled were fatefully different, even as they looked pretty much the same as the few million the family had accumulated over the generations. It was the number at the end of the last page, the handwriting becoming more bold and erratic with each digit: 04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f.
These last few dozen pages which would change everything for the Nakamotos contained all the proof that was necessary to convince their community that their claim was real, and so consensus spread that they now had 65 whole bitcoin and some change! With this single large change to the community's consensus of who owned what, an invisible threshold was crossed: most of the world's wealth was again stored behind known private keys, rather than ones that merely existed but were [fundamentally inaccessible in practice](
Then, as an echo of an earlier family disaster, but not as destructive to their fortunes, the binders full of hand-written cryptography lay submerged in water for a week as a nearby river flooded, obliterating the pencil writing that Dorian and his ancestors had slaved over for so long. But like the one ancient Micronesian whose wealth sat on the sea floor, it didn't matter that Dorian's proof was gone: the ledger in the community's mind had already reached consensus, and that consensus held that Dorian owned those 65 and change bitcoin. And despite the inflation such a sudden injection of money caused to the post-Last War global economy, nobody begrudged Dorian this wealth, knowing that with bitcoin, they had thrown off the yoke of rogue statism for good and won the Last War.

But projecting omniscience onto Andreas and blindly throwing money at whatever he spoke approvingly of at some point, as if what is once true will be true forever, is another thing.
If you're basing your investment decisions on what any single person says, you're doing it wrong, IMHO. Did you pay for Andreas's "investment advice" (which it was certainly *not*)? NO.

Those who don't "deserve" to be rich, because they're bad at making and/or keeping money, and got to be rich *only* due to luck, will likely lose a lot of their wealth over time.

Not true. Because the nonce is in the third 32-byte chunk of the block header, it suffices to give miners a "midstate" value that is essentially already a hash of the first two 32-byte chunks, which contain the hash of the previous block and the merkle root. You'd need to know the merkle root (which the pool operator could keep secret until it publishes the block) just to be able to know if the midstate hash value corresponds to the previous public block, or not (and therefore corresponds to some previously unseen block).

The market **regulates**. Those exchanges that are unsafe eventually go out of business. The fear of meeting this fate keeps others in line. Is this regulation insufficient for you? Even entities regulated and supervised by governments go out of business sometimes - sometimes even losing money for depositors.
Be careful that you don't fall prey for safety theatre - where you feel safe because you assume that Big Brother will cover for you. Big Brother won't cover you if the bank/exchange/whatever wasn't complying with the requirements of this insurance - but you don't find that out until it's too late.
Don't trust the label "regulated and supervised" so blindly.
The blockchain **supervises**. This is a weaker argument, but would you feel safer if an unregulated exchange published all the addresses it controls? Then you could personally supervise their business, if you have the time, energy, and desire to do so.

Real-life cash isn't perfectly fungible either. In my neck of the woods cash van robberies are a common thing, so the cash transport companies lock the cash in boxes that spam the banknotes with purple ink if the box gets opened improperly. Those notes then are not perfectly substitutes for clean notes. They get confiscated (although without necessarily also putting you in jail).
I once had one of these notes, ironically I got them from a bank teller just half an hour before I tried spending it. It had just a little patch of that purple ink - I didn't even notice it. But the tyre / exhaust shop cashier did, and refused to accept it. I took it back to the bank that gave it to me and got lucky in that they gave me a good new one - but that seemed more like the exception than the rule. (Maybe the bank teller recognized me from earlier.)
Everyone knows that things work like this, so it isn't too much of a problem in practice. I'd love to know what sort of exchange rate between purpled / non-purpled money governs the interface between hot and cold sub-economies.
Also, I intend this as a counter-example to a general claim that "compromised fungibility is always a 100% super-bad idea", and not the more specific claim, "non-fungible bitcoin is a terrible idea". I'm not sure of my opinion about the more specific claim.

Not quite so fast. You can opt out of using bitcoin, but you can't opt out of being exposed to the ecosystem it brings with it. You can't so easily opt out of being exposed to all the newly incentivized malware that tries to steal your wallet. If this gets much bigger, you won't be able to safely navigate the Internet! 0-day browser exploits become more valuable the bigger bitcoin becomes, but they affect everyone using them, not just those using bitcoin.

Disagree. It creates a commitment that's known to the rest of society. Doing this *creates trust*, the same way an OP_RETURN fidelity bond can create trust. When the rest of society knows about your commitment to "be married", there's a social cost to defecting (prisoner's dilemma-speak, not judging). And the marriage binds both parties, both parties know that the other knows, etc., which enables the couple to do things that they would otherwise consider too risky. Like buying a house together, or having a child, or deciding that one will be the "breadwinner" and the other the "houseperson". Without the contract, and the commitment that creates it, one or both parties could end up being or just feeling vulnerable to the other's inscrutable private thoughts.

Yes, I think it will be hard to convince the first miner to fork to mine a block that all other nodes in the network at that point consider invalid. What's preventing miners right now from mining blocks that give them a 5000 pseudo-BTC block reward?
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:53:08


Not necessarily. Electricity isn't their only cost, but it is the largest component of their bills. I'd love to see better numbers about this, but a while back, blockchain.info had a miner profitability graph, and for the majority of Bitcoin's existence, their estimate was *negative*! Clearly blockchain.info's estimates could be wrong (and many respected voices on IRC constantly moan about just how wrong and misleading their various information bundles are), but I don't find it completely implausible that miner profitability might be negative. Especially in the age of ASIC miners, they have significant fixed costs to absorb (capital equipment - the ASIC miners), and once absorbed, a situation can arise where the rational thing to do is to keep mining even though it doesn't cover (all) your costs (finance costs in particular). Also add in some irrational exhuberance, I find it not just plausible, but somewhat likely.
And that says nothing about an *individual* miner's returns. They might well be paying a 30% premium just to mine their coins rather than just buying them.
Besides, if bitcoin costs 30% more in Argentina, don't you think mining equipment will also cost roughly that much more?

Spinning fan blades can be close to invisible, and people can easily walk into them by accident. You don't accidentally transfer money into a bitcoin exchange.


I am indeed not a Gox victim, but if you are, then I can redirect the assumption to you: you only want regulation because you've been personally affected.
My view is that bitcoin is not only a (real or would-be) currency or a payment system or any of those technical things; it's also a political statement - a vote against the "think of the children!" sort of yearning for "won't somebody please do something about it" regulation. The market can self-regulate. We should give it a chance to do so, and regulate by government action only if the market fails to impose discipline.

Misapplication of the 51% heuristic. You could inflate bitcoin to an ultimate 42M units right now if you wanted. If it were just you alone it would be pointless, but all you need is *one* other person willing to transact with you using that inflated version of bitcoin.
A 51% "attack" on the money supply can divide, but it cannot conquer: it *creates* a new currency - one with the proposed change and leaves the one without intact, albeit perhaps with reduced hash power backing its security. In one currency, the "attack" succeeds completely, and on the other, not at all. The new currency differs by having a new rule in the protocol: after block N (the point at which the currencies diverge) the total supply jumps to 42M.

You're comparing unlike scenarios. Blade guards are there to protect people who didn't opt into walking into the spinning fan blades.

What I'm getting at is that (to me anyway) how "good" a tool is isn't limited to merely its functionality, but also includes how its ecosystem treats me. A tool with all the features in the world isn't much good to me if there's some party out there who can (and does!) capriciously use their veto power over what that tool can do. That possibility of losing access to the functionality has to factor into the tool's net present value: one needs to discount the possibility that its value (well, for a particular task anyway) can drop to zero at any point in the future.

I think it's reasonable to expect everyone in Bitcoin to hold that assumption too. Nobody's forcing Bitcoin down anyone's throat - people are choosing it *voluntarily*.
All this talk about "guard rails" is a bit infuriating in its doublespeak. I don't want **your guard rails**! You're welcome to them however. It's easy: don't use Bitcoin if you're afraid of potentially dodgy basement operations! You have an entire world filled with your coveted "guard rails". Go use those.

It reads like what you want is steganography. I don't see why a cryptocurrency network is anything like an ideal medium for exchanging steganographic messages.

You don't need to take my phrasing as a personal attack. "Even if that were true" includes the possibility that it is true. The point was that it doesn't matter whether it's true [that a majority blah blah].
I'd assert that less than 5% of the *global* population even has any opinion - at least one that's strong enough to motivate them to choose one way or another during a blockchain fork. I also think that more than 5% of the global population have some recent experience in their families of seeing their subverted governments debase them into poverty, and are at least tolerant of, if not actively in favour of, a more gold-like money supply.
I think one needs to be in a fairly privileged position in order to be in favour of a continually expanding money supply: 1) you need to be sufficiently educated to see past naive "more gold = mine is worth less" ideas, that creating money can actually also create wealth; 2) live in a context where people have not seen abuses of monetary policy-making power in generations.


So what's up with Dogecoin? AFAIK it has an unlimited ultimate supply. There are plenty other too that don't toe the fixed-supply line. So why is Bitcoin still (and increasingly?) so dominant?
Clearly the ultimate money supply isn't as big an issue to people as you're making it out to be.


I think you misunderstand what "consensus" is. It isn't merely "most" people agreeing to something, it's *everyone* agreeing (or very close to everyone - at 99% or whatever we simply freeze out the remaining 1% and say to ourselves "you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs).

If they actually did that, their "because national security" claims might have a little more credibility. I'd rather they not exist in their current form where they just slurp up everything, spying on everyone without a warrant, but since they *do* exist, I'm unconvinced that their help in finding those stolen coin would be a bad thing. We (well, you) have already paid for their existence; you might as well sweat the asset a little. (For this reason I also don't think it's hypocritical of libertarians / anarcho-capitalists to take advantage of existing social welfare benefits.)

I could see solutions evolving in the typically human messy, organic way. Maybe we'll hand each other private keys printed as QR codes, maybe not even encrypted, with each person through whose hands it passes adding their (old-school, handwritten) signature. If your signature isn't on the token, you can't spend it - people who don't already trust you won't accept your QR code. Eventually the list of signatures gets too long or someone wants their coin online, and they can sweep the key into their wallet. And if the coin aren't there anymore? Oh well, time to start tracking down the issuer(s). Maybe even sell these counterfeit tokens to scary underworld type people for satoshis on the bitcoin.

I'm not in the US but our own central bank similarly has issued shares and I guess the regulated banks own some of these. (It used to be that random people could also own these shares, but they're no longer listed on the JSE.)
But it's a very different kind of shareholding than when you own shares in Google or BASF or whatever. It's almost just a ceremonial thing, and the only benefit you have by being a shareholder is being invited to some meetings and you get to ask the reserve bank governor questions.
You *don't* get to vote in or out the "board of directors" (I don't know if a body by that name even exists in the SARB) and they don't raise capital like normal listed companies do, so as a shareholder you don't really have much power over them.

There looks to be quite a bit more than ~1500kg of metal shelving alone, and if you add the miners that will be there when you're sucking 1MW+, that's a lot of added thermal inertia.
(The worst case here in terms of unrespondable fires is an *empty* facility somehow catching fire, not a full one. But I agree with you that "so we can determine if" is a bit optimistic.)
Fun fact: if you filled that room (actual size, not phantomcircuit's estimate) with water, it would take 1MW just under a month to bring it to a boil. That's assuming spherical cows and no heat loss through the walls.

If the two endpoints of your channel can both connect to the Bitcoin network, then why can't you just have the two endpoints communicate directly? Heck you could even run your own Bitcoin-in-a-box network that doesn't interact with the rest of the network, if you insist on Bitcoinizing your signalling. It would be less antisocial that way.
These hacks are cool and amusing, but they're *terrible* ways to do things "for real". It's inefficient, not certain to work (there's no guarantee your transactions will get to the other side, and the other side will never know that anything's missing), and parasitic (you're polluting the rest of the network).
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:45:33


Even if that were true, it wouldn't be enough. The current status quo is that everyone on the network agrees that there should be an ultimate supply of ~21M BTC. Even if the vast majority of participants feels that it should be, say, 42M instead, somebody has to move first and choose to fork themselves off the "real" Bitcoin network.
What incentive does anyone holding any bitcoin have to unilaterally fork themselves onto an unused, unmined alternative blockchain?
Consensus has inertia, and you need a *substantial* advantage to overcome the network effects of an established consensus. "Most" people disagreeing with Bitcoin's philosophical tenets doesn't seem like it would cut it, IMHO.

Speak for yourself. When I'm driving late at night, I often worry about some drunk asswipe doing something stupid and ruining my day. The difference between this and the fear for your life you feel with a revolver pointed at you, is a quantitative and not a qualitative one. Imagine if the revolver had 400 chambers and only 3 were loaded.


For many people, sanctioning their licence *is* "ruining their life".


How much harsher can you go than whatever punishments people get for killing someone while sober? Shall we torture them? Imprison their families too, because they alone cannot take sufficient punishment?


Look, I understand the position you're arguing. Personally I even agree with it partially. But there's a definitional problem lurking in the word "harm". I feel like merely putting someone else's welfare at risk, even if the regret doesn't occur, is "harm".

Jobs aren't valuable to society in and of themselves. If you created a million jobs for people to dig holes and fill them in again after they're done, does that add anything to society?

And what do you do if there were multiple inputs? How do you know which of those quasi-from-addresses is the right one?

By squishing a branch before merging it, you lose the ability to bisect  the changes in order to find the commit that introduces a bug. You'd find just a single mega-change, containing all the changes of the topic branch together, the bug hidden among dozens / hundreds of lines of diff.

It's results that matter, not intentions.




Again, insurance, but this has a bit more meat. This might be hard to insure using standard insurance products, but I think prediction markets could address that: if a politician is confident that they did a good job and locked down that goodness for 20 years, they could offer a series of events: "Economy is X good 10 years from now" and buy or sell that event based on their generally superior knowledge of how good a job they did. In fact it would be a bit irrational *not* to hedge away as much of this risk of a force majeure as you can.

In general I want to agree with you, in that I think the majority of this "chart candlestick ceiling floor bullshit" (I love the term!) you see is just the self-selecting sample of amateurs who got lucky timing the market, the price movements on bitcoin exchanges are not those of a (purely) random process. There are people and programmed bots buying and selling, and they respond to stimuli... that come from the price. They're all trying to identify what the market is going to do next, and then pile onto that. When everyone's panic-buying, they want to buy too, and get out (just before) when everyone else stops buying. I see this "chart candlestick ceiling floor bullshit" as an (imperfect) way of reaching distributed consensus. Every trade on an exchange is like a block in a blockchain, and that trade represents proof of work. (I thought at first it would be analogous to proof-of-stake, but it isn't the total amount at stake that matters, it's the size of the individual trade, determining the risk (work) that each side of the trade took.)

Let me guess... you're thinking of a deflationary spiral? Well unlike apparently most bitcoiners, I'm not 100% convinced of this "deflation is totally okay!" thing. But not 0% either.
Now why are we so afraid of the deflationary death spiral? Because the positive feedbacks scare us: declining prices make people to postpone their consumption, which leads to short-term oversupply, which leads to further declines in prices. That's bad, right? Sure, I think so too!
But there's also negative feedback: as people reduce their consumption, supply reduces too, albeit on a slightly longer timescale. But not as long as it used to be a few decades ago! Today we have shorter supply chains and lower inventories - think of all the just-in-time supply chain management that came out of Japan. That's a force that would reduce the depth of deflationary excursions.
Let's go a step back: *why* do prices decline? Prices decline when the supply of goods and services outruns the supply of money. That describes exactly a *growing economy* - everyone's better off, definitely not a bad thing! Now declines in prices aren't inherently bad - we pay less every year and get more for what we do pay, every time that we buy electronic goods. On Monday I bought a 2.5" 1TB hard disk for less than I paid 8 years ago for a 3.5" 320GB disk. Less money for more disk. The world didn't come to an end - in fact the opposite: the electronics business did so well that it invested in factories to manufacture these superior goods!
Well what if prices decline really strongly, surely that's a bad thing? For that to happen, the (local) supply of goods needs to strongly outrun the (local) supply of money. I don't know that that's a bad thing, but maybe it is. Let's suppose it is a bad thing - wouldn't it then be a good thing to pour a bucket of cold water over that part of the economy, to cool it down a bit so it doesn't "overheat"? Hey presto, enter deflation, and people deferring their consumption in expectation of further price declines.
Can such declines continue forever? No, they can't: at some point the suppliers see the reduced demand, and adjust their production downward (which isn't bad, because they were **over**producing right?) to match demand better. At some point (hopefully small) inventories are used up and things can return to normal again. Using up excess inventory resulting from overproduction sounds like a good thing to me!
So sure, maybe deflationary spirals are a bad thing. I don't know (I'm not being sarcastic). But it seems to me that the usual explanations of these death spirals are incomplete.

What I think you might not be realizing is that adding a SHA-256 hash of one of the password components is adding no more entropy than just appending, say, your month of birth! The entropy the hash adds is all in the choice of hash algorithm, not at all in its value. How many hash algorithms can you name? Take the log (base 2) of that number - that's roughly an *upper bound* on how many bits of entropy your scheme adds.

I was just taking issue with cherry-picking the -10% scenario as worth mentioning. When you're doing many transactions, your risk isn't that any particular transaction's value ends up being 10% down from what you expected it would be, because there will be other transactions whose value ends up being 10% higher, that balance the ones in the red. The risk is the variance that's left over after all the expectations are tallied.

You're right: it *is* "if you aren't doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide" rhetoric.
The difference is that money laundering (the kind that regulators care about) is about making the provenance of money obscure even to the regulatory apparatus, which can see more than is visible to ordinary members of the public. The (explicit, anyway) purpose of tumbling is to obscure it to ordinary members of the public, even though doing so also obscures it to regulatory apparatus, who have no special skills of an auspex in the blockchain.
You don't need to "launder" your salary when it's paid in dollars because your employer can't see what happens to the money after they give it to you. They can if they pay you in bitcoin!

You could neither buy nor sell every coin in existence at that price, but that isn't what "market cap" represents. What it represents is a summary of how valuable its holders consider it to be. They don't think it is (much) less than the market cap, because otherwise they'd flood the market with their "overvalued" coin. They also don't think it's (much) more than the market cap, or they'd be pulling their sell orders.
A company stock's market cap also doesn't represent a suitcase full of cash that's in the company's possession. In fact the company may have raised far, far less than the market cap - a high market cap, by itself, doesn't help the company at all!

If merchants use something like Bitpay, they don't need to sit on any amount of bitcoin. Direct volatility risk for merchants is pretty much a red herring - they can hedge away that risk by setting prices, and getting paid, in whatever fiat-based currency they prefer, while still allowing their customers to pay in bitcoin.
Volatility is a much bigger problem for consumers, people holding some amount of bitcoin. Having your money be worth double or half of what it was yesterday unnerves people, but then again the volatility has been there for all of bitcoin's history, and that hasn't stopped people using it! Clearly bitcoin is good enough for those people now, and I don't see how it's supposed to get worse, which is what it would have to do to make them leave the bitcoin ecosystem.
Consider also that merchants' acceptance of bitcoin is a sunk cost. They can't recover anything (or at least: much) by refusing bitcoin transactions when they once accepted them. The business and software development costs have been paid, and the people who made that happen aren't about to return their salaries that paid for that effort. So to me any incentive to ditch bitcoin once you've already begun accepting it, is a lot weaker than the incentive to start accepting it in the first place (and by definition, the incentive to start is at least as strong as the disincentive to spend the money that makes it happen, or else it wouldn't happen).

How would you speculate with a commodity (?) that's just been banned? That's the very opposite of what makes a commodity good for speculation - to speculate, you want something that's easily marketable. Banning bitcoin would hit the exchanges hardest (basically making them stop existing), which is THE way for speculators to make their money.
I'm not sure that'd be such a bad thing - if the speculators left, the remaining uses that people put bitcoin to would be more currency-like, which to me seems to be the most revolutionary use case for bitcoin.


I think person-to-person exchanges would continue to happen, but perhaps with less stigma attached than buying drugs. It wouldn't be only a bunch of drug-addled lowlifes buying their fix - the banning government would have a significantly harder task convincing people that it's "just a bunch of Silk Road druggies" using bitcoin if there are very legitimate-looking people still using it - people you know. The sorts of people who earn bitcoin or spend it through places like - who are now able to find clients and service providers globally with less friction than by using PayPal or credit cards.


I can't speak for throwaway-o, but *I* think many people will buy bitcoin regardless of whether it's legal to do so or not. Maybe not *as many* as do now.


That's quite a strong claim, IMHO. Do you think revolutions generally happen with the approval of the governments they overthrow?

You can use the Bitcoin blockchain to establish proof of existence of a document, but that is not the same as a proof that another party saw and agreed to a contract.

What I think we have here are incompatible and irreconcileable values on each side of the "debate". One side wants a cheap Visa competitor, the other wants to commit a political act. The former is willing to "work within the system" in order to get what it wants, while the latter is willing to forego the convenience the former's vision offers in order to get what it wants. Just how *do* you get these tribes to even sit at the same table? They don't have a common understanding of the *meaning* of Bitcoin; there's very little in shared assumptions about what the goal state is. How do you negotiate under these conditions?

They can, but why would they reject a *valid* block? A block full of SD transactions isn't *invalid*.
Miners would only have the incentive to reject a spamblock if they thought that enough other miners would reject it that they would be on the 51%+ side of the choice. They don't have to consider block propagation, because the spamblock isn't theirs, so they don't have to propagate it.

You don't need a majority of miners to spam-attack the network. Obviously a rogue miner's effect will be diluted by the network hash power relative to their own, but if the spam-block is valid, even if it's bigger than other miners' soft-cap, it goes into the chain. Other miners' soft-cap is a size limit on their *own* blocks, not on those they receive from the network.

We're currently in a (strongly) deflationary regime in the bitcoin economy because the goods available to it are increasing rapidly. The same amount of money (mining-based inflation is a much smaller effect) chasing more goods results in dropping prices. This situation is an aberration - a non-equilibrium state.
Once we reach equilibrium, an economic collapse will reduce the number of goods available. That spells *inflation*, not deflation. The mechanism that cause deflation in our fractional-reserve banking system (credit contraction) don't exist in bitcoin: you can't lend bitcoin that you don't have - you can't "create money" as those many youtube videos on the subject call it.
You are right that deflation puts a floor on the profitability of businesses that can get funding, and I'm not as sanguine as some about that being necessarily a good thing "because environment".

I never expressed disbelief in that proposition. You're replying with the tone of someone who thinks they disagree with me? "Even if" does not imply disbelief.
Where I did (apparently too subtly) imply disbelief was in the notion that any technologically accessible block size would be enough for a naive scaling of Bitcoin on-chain transaction capacity to Visa level. 2 or 3MB aren't going to give you that. (Or even the roughly 4MB effective max block size that segwit would bring.)


Did I say that they were? No, I didn't. I wrote just that Bitcoin is not politically inert. Technological considerations alone do not suffice in deciding what *should* happen. That's why my lead-in earlier was "even if" - technological capacity to use &gt;1MB blocks is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for using bigger blocks in Bitcoin.


What's at stake is the permanent extinction of decentralized cryptocurrency as we now understand it. If government acronym agencies are able to subvert Bitcoin, they can subvert anything else of its genre. There won't be a take-over - hostile regulators will have wisened up in the meantime and they won't give us a second chance to try again.

Creates value in the bitcoin economy: people trading to benefit both.


Creates no value, arguably destroys it in negative externalities. Bids up transaction fees for everyone.
One of these increases the utility of Bitcoin, and hence probably boosts the value of the currency unit. The other diminishes it.


I'm not a fungibility maximalist like some/most. IMHO *if* we can identify payments to ransomware authors and other baddies, then we're perfectly entitled to "censor" them by not relaying them or (if we're a miner) not mining them. That only affects us locally; it doesn't compel anyone else to do the same. As long as we aren't a dominant miner, then [this doesn't amount to censorship]( When the "bad" transaction gets mined by someone else, we have little choice but to accept it then, so this isn't even a "slippery slope".

Everyone *doesn't*! There's a whole [list of cool things we could do with a hardfork]( but we haven't gotten them (so far) because hard forks are so problematic.
But I agree with the notion that *if* we're going to have one anyway for some other reason(s), we might as well increase the block size limit again (I think - I don't really think that "1MB forever" constitutes an "economic promise". I do think however that "no hardforks ever \[\*\]" *might* be one.)


I think subsequent to implementing the cap, we've concluded that the block size limit also influences decentralization. *If* Satoshi seriously thought that Bitcoin would and should ultimately be run only from data centers, then I think that was a mistake (yes, this God can make mistakes). It's easy to "cut off the heads" of a network controlled by data center operators.
I don't think there are many who think it's important to keep the limit so low *because they think that's the right limit*. I think most of the opposition to raising the limit is actually opposition to hard forking. That's why soft-fork SegWit got so much support so easily - it *effectively* raises the block size limit, without requiring a hard fork. It'll be interesting to see how the "plan" for later hard-forking SegWit goes. Also, I'd like to see some actual code flying around for some of the other limit-skirting proposals, like the "extended blocks" proposal, that can also be implemented as soft forks.

If you're not running a full node, you're foregoing many (most?) of the benefits of using Bitcoin.

Transmitting transactions and storing them in the blockchain has a cost: to the operators of those nodes. The users of those transactions aren't paying those transmission and storage costs. That's an externality. If your business model depends strictly on externalizing these costs, then you should seriously consider whether that business model is viable. Not that it definitely is unviable, just that you should seriously consider the question and not just dismiss it with handwaving about how "merchants" will out of the goodness of their hearts continue to run nodes, or whatever. (They already seem to be outsourcing this. Where will we be if only a few coinbase-like entities end up actually running nodes, with everybody else simply using some API to query things?)

Yes, and that's pretty much the end of this road and things look a lot more uncertain beyond that (as you note). Just because something is not known to be impossible doesn't mean it'll inevitably happen.


Just because it's on someone's "roadmap" doesn't mean it'll happen according to schedule, or even at all. Remember when cellphones were getting smaller every year and we started to believe they'd get smaller forever? And then they suddenly started getting bigger again.


What is that supposed to mean?


I have doubts about whether we'll ever see that as a feature of general-purpose computing. Pity really, when I was a kid I "designed" the computer for my future starship and it was to have 256-bit general-purpose registers. Sure, we'll have some wide registers and it will be possible to use 128-bit or larger entities natively, but I think sizeof (int) will be 8 basically forever.
There's simply no real need for more than 64-bit general-purpose computing. With 64 bits, basically every byte of state that exists in a general-purpose computer is addressable. I simply don't see us running out of local address space for a loooong time. And address space is what's driven the 16-&gt;32-&gt;64-bit computing transitions. (And remember: we had &gt;4GB hard disks long before we used 64-bit CPUs.)

@_date: 2016-03-09 13:23:28


No, but...


Yes, I think there is. The "at the expense of" would not necessarily be a deliberate choice, but as a side effect. Imagine there's one miner that is privileged network-wise compared to all of the rest of the network (maybe they own a transoceanic cable or something). They could profit from mining 500GB blocks - because they "pay" (read: it's free for them) the cost of storing and transmitting that block only once, but *each other participant* in the network has to pay that too. It's basically an incentive to pollute the river, because it's cheaper to pour your oil down the river than to dispose of it more responsibly, and you don't have to compensate other users of the river.
It may be a weak incentive, for now at least.
Even if miners do coordinate to crypto-softfork a lower size limit (meaning: they mine only blocks smaller than X, but they don't necessarily tell us that that's their policy), because miners don't pay the full cost of the blocks they put into the network, the effective block size may be "too high". (Remember: miners are not the only ones running full nodes. Nor should they be the only ones.)


Miners aren't monolithic - there's no technological imperative for miners to be addressable at all. They could choose to go dark and we'd have no idea who's mining these 500GB blocks.


If that's more than it costs them individually to mine gigablocks, and they don't individually carry the consequences of everyone getting pissed off (and it's basically impossible to force miners to have a reliable identity without breaking some core "promises" in Bitcoin), then why wouldn't they? Do you want to rely on benevolence here?

Do you understand and agree that for *some* miner it will be rational to stop mining after the block reward halves? Now consider that, hypothetically, every miner faces identical constraints: electricity is just as expensive, cost of capital is the same (but mind you - mining gear is close to a sunk cost, so it doesn't influence into your marginal cost of mining). Because mining is a lottery, each miner's chance of having the right ticket is independent of every other miner's, so every miner's decision whether to continue mining or not is independent. Therefore, if you can imagine *one* miner discontinuing their operation, then it follows that it's possible for *all* miners to stop.
And the more mature mining becomes, the closer all the miners get to marginal operation, the less diversity in cost structure there is, and the *more* likely a mass exit becomes.

Where does the white paper mention the block size limit? How can you infer intent if it isn't mentioned at all?
If the limit was never meant to stay, then the code would have included logic that removes the limit after block NNN. It doesn't. So the only objective data we have (that the code doesn't include such a sunset clause on the block size limit) suggests that it was intended to stay forever.


How exactly does the white paper state it will be like? And don't quote the headline, "cash" can mean anything. We don't even know if Satoshi intended or even hoped that this thing would become real money and not just, say, a prototype, a proof of concept.

(SW and blocksize increase are orthogonal, so the "increase blocksize!!!11" is not the appropriate alternative here. They're not mutually exclusive.)


I'm starting to think that's the opposite of a "nuclear option". I think it would *de*-escalate the Bitcoin war and ease the hostility between camps. An amicable divorce instead of a divorce court deathmatch-to-bankruptcy.

No harder to explain at all. All it would need is for newly allocated memory to be initialized to the hypothetical constant PRIVKEY_INVALID ( as -1), and then overwriting only part of the 256 bits of private key with real entropy. There's nothing hugely special about starting from zero. Starting from 0xFFFFF... or from 0xAAAAA... just implies a hypothesis about how the key generation code works, effectively making that code part of the key to be cracked. There's not a huge lot of entropy in algorithms.

Not *everyone* will choose to pay the higher fee. Some people will choose rather to use layer N+1 protocols (maybe Lightning when it's available? or changetip?).
It's like a very popular restaurant, that due to its popularity (because its chef make amazing food) can / has to raise its prices ("has to" because they'd rather have people grumbling about expensive meals than have a riot at the front door) and as a result the queues stay a manageable length. Patrons get to eat great food, they get the convenience of being able to show up and be served *relatively* soon, but yes, they have to pay for the privilege. Unlike the restaurant across the road that refuses to raise their prices, lets everyone in, and as a result has all kinds of riffraff inside eating shitty burgers (which are literally everywhere in town), ruining the experience for those who are there for the chef's signature steak and peanut butter dish, which is unique to the place.

Segwit is worse than just larger blocks, from a short-term miner's perspective. It enables much more useful layer-2 technologies (by dealing with malleability), which will enable substitution of on-chain block space with off-chain space. In the short term, that increases the price elasticity of demand for on-chain block space, which means miners will be able to capture less of the consumer surplus.

On-chain transactions almost by definition can't be an efficient payment system: they're simply too slow, even with the minimum level of security - 1 confirmation. And don't say "but zero-conf!" Zero-conf transactions are by definition *not on-chain transactions* - they're not there yet!

Then just ask for non-SW coins. The SW provenance of a coin doesn't affect its fungibility - to non-SW nodes a coin 'tainted' by SW just looks like a coin that's gone through a step of "anyone can spend this".


I don't see enough incentive to maintain a parallel market for coins that have *ever* been 'segregated'. If the coin you're putatively accepting is not itself a segwit transaction (i.e. is not controlled by an anyone-can-spend condition according to pre-SW rules), then it has no other stigma. Any such 'segregated' history just looks like someone spending an anyone-can-spend coin to non-SW nodes. The only reason anyone would care about the non-immediate SW provenance of a coin is some weird Verian ideology. There's no technical reason to care. SW transactions are not "less valid" than pre-SW transactions. If anything, they're "*more valid*" - they conform to *stricter* rules, not looser ones. (But actually not 'more' or 'less' at all - just *exactly as valid*.)

And why is that a problem?

Soft forks don't set a precedent for government acronym agencies to use to subvert Bitcoin's "social contract". The soft fork slope is less slippery.

See this is what I don't get about them: [*why* do they want 2MB blocks?]( The *real* problem I think is that they want "moar transactions pls", but increasing block size is just *one* possible way to do that. And according to many of the Bitcoin Core devs, a bad way, because it invites so many other problems.


Well, this isn't like just updating to a newer version of Windows. We aren't just dealing with software here, but with a *network*. A network that has to *agree exactly* on the total state of the ledger, if it wants to be useful at all. If this were just about updating software, you'd have less controversy the closer the proposed new block size is to 1MB, but instead you get *more controversy* the "smaller" the change is (in terms of normal software everyone's acclimated to by now, over the last 3 decades). It's because making this kind of change *at all* (a hard fork) is hugely dangerous, both technically and politically (and I mean grand-politically, not just Core-vs-Classic-politically - I mean emboldening amoral acronym agencies to subvert the experiment whose whole purpose was to "[gain a new territory of freedom for several years]( I fear that the more we get used to hard forks as "normal", the more centralized our de facto social overlay on the Bitcoin network will become, making it easier to "cut off the heads".

And that still doesn't mean Bitcoin Core is "centralized". If all its maintainers (those with push access) get run over by a bus, the repository doesn't stop existing. People could and would fork it, and make releases, and if these alternate releases are consensus-compatible, people will use them. And in a very real sense it will still be "Bitcoin Core" - code derived from today's source code, and compatible with it.


I know what git is, thanks. And there is not just one branch that's deployed. Every release is made from a separate branch. So it's already vacuously false that only one branch is deployed. More substantively, anyone with the motivation can take their own copy of the central repository and modify it, as I have (some trivial changes), and they'll still be running "Bitcoin Core" in any reasonable sense. But once you start making consensus-incompatible changes, I think you've crossed a line where you can no longer claim to be running "Bitcoin Core", even if what you're running is *derived* from it.
So, did you go and check out how many people's contributions have been merged into Bitcoin Core? By my count it's 500, although a few of those are no doubt different spellings / nicknames / pseudonyms of the same person. How in Satoshi's name is that evidence of "centralization"?

Show some practical quantum computers with the capacity to keep enough of the quantum genies in the bottle to compute a hash160 and we can talk again. Or if someone makes some significant theoretical breakthrough on either RIPEMD160 or SHA256, or by far better, the combination of the two.

If this were shares in some company, I'd completely agree with you. But this is different in an important way: Bitcoin *is money*. While you can't buy milk and bread with AAPL or with GOOG, you can with bitcoin - especially if it phase transitions to mainstream acceptance.
It simply isn't as necessary to "take profit" out of your bitcoin holdings, because one of the big reasons to "take profit", which is to have your capital in a form you can use to buy things, doesn't apply.
Not that this entirely invalidates your advice. If back when you started with Bitcoin you decided you could stomach 5% of your net worth being in bitcoin, then you should seriously consider rebalancing your assets so that bitcoin again constitutes 5%. It won't "cost" you money to get your coins "back" because if your risk tolerance is for 5%, then you're not going to be buying more bitcoin unless they're cheaper than they are now.
Or you could delude yourself into thinking that you're okay with an ever-rising fraction of your net worth being in the form of bitcoin. That's what I'm doing.

Because BU signaling is not binding on Bitcoin full nodes. It may be binding on BU nodes, but that's really a distinct network that, for now, is mutually intelligible with the traffic on the Bitcoin network. SW signalling *is* binding on full nodes, because once full nodes that are SW-literate (and 80%+ of them are) see 95% signaling for it in blocks, they start enforcing SW rules.
Bitcoin nodes will summarily reject BU blocks that are &gt;1MB, so they can signal BU till they're blue in their face, it won't change anything. 
Remember: it's *full nodes* that enforce the consensus rules; in terms of consensus rule enforcement, miners are just ordinary full nodes who happen to have a financial stake in their blocks being valid. *That* is why they enforce the consensus rules - because they don't want to lose money. Not because we need them for that.

I can't speak to what it is "supposed" to be. We no longer have access to the one person who can authoritatively say what anything is "supposed" to be like.
What we do know is that 95% *soft* forks are just fine. They happen fairly quickly. Why should *hard* forks be held to a lower standard of buy-in by the very narrow constituency that is the miners?
Also, I simply don't agree that requiring 95% for a hard fork is "impossible". You'd get that very quickly IMHO if tomorrow we learned that SHA256d is horribly broken and trivially preimage-able and we had a proposal to hardfork to basically anything else.
That a (particular) blocksize hardfork fails to get more than even a tiny minority of hash power supporting it should give you pause to reflect on how necessary and urgent this really is. We're not even talking of a situation where &gt;&gt;50% of miners have put their money where their mouths are in supporing bigger blocks and the community rejects it.
If this hardfork is so important, why don't those who believe this simply go ahead and run their fork, even with only a tiny minority of hash power backing them? That's one of the nice things about a hard fork - you get to change *any* consensus rules you want! So you don't even need a mere majority of hash power backing you. No percentage threshold of blocks mined can make a hard fork impossible. A hard fork is *always possible* - it's an act of fiat.

Erm, it's true that with segregated witness data not everyone will have to get the witnesses, but those won't be the full full nodes, only half full nodes. They will act like current full nodes do now, and they will simply see blocks full of transactions like "some money moved and anyone can spend it". They'll be able to continue to track the UTXO set, but they'll have a slightly distorted view: those transaction outputs won't *really* be redeemable by anyone. Transactions trying to spend those outputs may propagate through SW-unaware nodes, but they'll never get mined.
To have the full picture (like you'd want if you were to accept 0-conf transactions) you'd have to do the witness validation, which *would* require more network traffic to get. Otherwise you'd get scammed by people "paying" with SW transactions to themselves, which to your pre-SW node would look like valid payments (that mysteriously never get confirmations).

It isn't a "store" of value so much as an honest signal of excess productivity either in the past (savings) or in the future (debt - someone found future-you credible enough to let now-you use their money). But it isn't a "store", because it isn't like a water tank where if you store one liter, you can later withdraw exactly one liter. With money one can only claim what is available. If there's nobody with excess productivity when you want to spend your money (desert island scenario, aka ageing populations in some countries) then you just can't redeem your "store", or only very, very expensively. Fixed money supply doesn't magically banish inflation.

I think Bitcoin Core should stay out of any UASF deployment as much as possible. Some well-known contributor(s) could though sign a gitian build, which would be more an act of an individual than of an informal group, IMHO. If they get involved as a group (even an informal one), perhaps by writing the code, I think too many people will interpret that as abusing their position of trust in the community. ("Trustlessness" as a virtue refers to who controls the money, not to whom you trust to write code that you run on your computer without personally reviewing every last line.)

Major difference: a "MAHF" gets summarily ignored by full nodes unless their operators specifically change the software running on them to follow the HF rules. In contrast, full nodes will go along with a 51% attack and won't be any the wiser other than seeing a large number of orphan blocks.

They can only limit it unilaterally. They have no credible commitment mechanism to manage it down collectively. This lack of credible commitment leaves each of them individually with the incentive to capture as much of the mempool into their blocks as they can.
With the BU block size "protocol", they have a mechanism by which to punish defectors (miners who get greedy and mine more than their emergent cartel says they should): the other miners get to mine bigger blocks too. A sort of MAD on block sizes.


Yeah, but I don't think they want that. They **don't want layer 2**. Check out today's thread about Jihan Wu's "offer to negotiate": 
If we gave them the hard forked max block size increase, they still wouldn't want layer 2 technologies to get any more traction. They (well some of them anyway) see layer 2 tech as competition, so they don't want it. That they want a max block size increase is not evidence of wanting lower fees; it's a price war to defeat layer 2 tech.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:02:00
The bigger problem is that segwit isn't the proposal that gives them the power to set block size limits, because with segwit, layer-2 technologies become a lot more viable. That's a problem for miners because it gives users an alternative to simply paying mining fees in order to transact securely. If users have more choice, that makes their demand for block space more elastic, which makes it more difficult for miners to capture consumer surplus.
BU's block size consensus protocol gives miners [a way to make credible commitments]( They can't do this with the "soft limit" that they could apply only unilaterally, when average block sizes were still significantly below 1MB.
TL;DR: Maybe miners want to converge on enforcing Luke-Jr's 300kB block size limit, but they can't do it alone. BU gives them the protocol to do it.

Not all money is cash.
Being able to buy your milk and bread with bitcoin relies on it being a common unit of account. It does not require such purchases to happen on the blockchain. They can happen in payment channels too - perhaps in a Lightning Network. Such transactions are real Bitcoin transactions, and they move money that's denominated in bitcoin (little b). Whether the blockchain carries coffee purchases directly or functions as a Swift-like settlement network is irrelevant. What's relevant is that the bitcoin (the unit) is what most things available in an economy are priced in: milk, bread, Internet service, your labour. If that happens, you won't need to sell ("take profit") your bitcoins in order to engage in these economic activities.

How do you confirm 2MB of transactions in a 1MB block?
If the average block size on the 2MB side of a fork exceeds 1MB, then it simply won't be possible to confirm all transactions on both sides. Also, the post-fork coinbase outputs will start tainting the UTXO set.
I can imagine a scenario where fungibility is broken by pre-fork coins are worth more than post-fork coins of either side. Or coins untainted by post-fork coinbase outputs of either side.

This does not amount to a hard fork. If they saw blocks on the network that weren't valid according to their pre-fork rules (not having opted into this ~~UASF~~UAHF), then it would be a hard fork. But that isn't how it is. The blocks flying across the network would still be valid according to the older consensus rules. That makes it a soft fork.

Users (plural) can *enforce* stricter rules. A single user cannot unilaterally do so without simply being ignored by everybody else.
Consider what happens in a SW-UASF: a miner can choose to either mine a SW-invalid block or a SW-valid block. The SW-invalid block still manages to propagate through a network (that rapidly partitions from the rest of the network as its nodes get banned), but they're worth 12.5 units of currency only to 20% of the superset network. To the other 80% they're worthless. OTOH a SW-valid block propagates through the entire network, and is worth 12.5 bitcoin to everyone, and the network doesn't partition: it simply operates according to the new rules for one more block.
In a sense, short of 100% buy-in, users don't set the rules in a global, absolute sense. Rather, they strongly *bias* the incentives for miners to conform to those new rules. That power to bias the incentives is out of proportion with the level of assent to the new rules among users.

We need to democratize access to mining chips. I don't see a way around that, and I remain unconvinced that even a PoW change (which would be philosophically self-defeating, IMHO) would teach the lesson to not accept centralized mining in a way that the lesson sticks forever.
Why has the Bitcoin community so abjectly failed to get *any* of the dominos of easy access to mining chips in line? I know that chip manufacturing has huge barriers to entry, but we don't even have an open sourced miner chip layout as far as I'm aware. Let alone one that's considered the standard for mining chips, being better than anything else available.
We can deal with democratized access to CMOS manufacturing later. I hope that's ultimately doable too. For now I think kitchen scale CMOS processes would be limited to about 1µm :( Somebody please page Jeri Ellsworth so we can get this Bitcoin Manhattan Programme rolling.

Think of it this way: unless they're generating keys by picking a random number (a real random one, high entropy), *all the keys they generate in their search are low-entropy keys*. Why? Because if they're not picking private keys randomly, then they're generating them algorithmically. And that's a low-entropy process. If they've tried "over 1000 trillion keys" then (unless you want to make a vacuously true statement like "5 septillion is 'over 1000 trillion') all those keys they tried have effectively 50 bits of entropy. So, a search of low-entropy key space finds low-entropy keys.
I'll hold my breath on their search finding a second preimage to *any* decent key.

A hard fork is not "hard" because it's difficult, or because it's disruptive.
It's "hard" because it's impossible to do it secretly. If you imagine a sheet of paper recording blocks, one after another, on successive rows, divided by consensus rules into columns, the a hard fork forces you to switch to a new column when it occurs - because it introduces consensus rules which are *incompatible with the pre-existing chain*.
Imagine a future human society where we decided that murder is now okay. That's a hard fork - it allows behaviours which were not allowed before. In contrast, if that society were to decide that whistling in public is a grave crime and it becomes illegal, that is a softfork, because a Rip van Winkle type person who emerged from their bunker would be able to recognize the behaviour of people in the new society as perfectly valid according to the pre-sleep rules they know. If they're observant, they might notice that nobody whistles anymore, but they wouldn't feel like they've stepped into an alien society.

That doesn't imply that he intends not to give it back, should they ask. It hints that he finds it unlikely that they'd bother to ask for their $10 back. Getting their $10 back would probably cost them more in paper shuffling than it's worth. And yes, that means he has caused damages to them, but that's a *civil* matter. While that seems fairly clear to me, it isn't clear to me that it's *also* a *criminal* matter. What exactly did he do? He bought some gold, and then he paid for it, with a completely valid transaction. At this point I don't know if he subsequently double-spent some of the inputs to that payment (at what point can you reasonably give up waiting and re-spend your coins?), but the way I understand this "attack", *that wasn't necessary*. His payment would never confirm not (only) because it's invalid (conflicting with another spend), but because no miner would ever bother to mine such a low-fee transaction.
Imagine going Reddit HQ, casting a giant block of concrete, and writing a cheque for $10 on it. It's a valid cheque, and you just leave it there on their lawn. If they give you gold in exchange for it, but they never deposit it because it's too damn inconvenient to do, then what exactly have you done wrong? He made an offer and they accepted it. What's the evidence that he committed "theft" or "fraud"? How did he mislead anyone (is it possible to mislead a computer?)? Did he take something without paying? (No, he didn't: he did pay. That his payment never got processed is the interesting part.)

In one of the recent previous softforks, one or other miner turned out to be signalling for the softfork but wasn't actually enforcing the new, more tightly constraining rules after the fork. They lost money mining a block or three that everybody else summarily *rejected*.

If the new rules are strictly more restrictive than the old rules, then it is a soft fork.
If nodes rejected any blocks whose block hash didn't end in the hex digit 'f', that would also be a soft fork. All blocks would have a hash ending in 'f', and they would still be valid blocks according to pre-fork rules. Also a soft fork. "Hard" and "soft" don't refer to how difficult/easy or how disruptive/smooth the activation is; they refer only to whether the consensus rules are relaxed (hard fork) or tightened (soft fork).

They are guaranteed a given miner if only that miner has the document. Imagine taking your will to a notary: you pay them then and there to notarize it (and they are contractually obliged to follow through). You have no incentive to take your will to another notary (and if you did anyway, you'd just pay the other one too - the full amount).
And presumably your contract with each of these notaries would specify that if another notary notarizes your document before them (you've double-spent your will), then they get to keep the fee you paid them and are released from the obligation to "mine" your will.

I disagree. Actually grinding keys like this has the potential to tell us that there's something we don't know about hash160, that we might not (*might not be able to!*) have access to with our current theoretical understandings.
Grinding keys can reveal the *existence* of structure in the cryptosystem, even structure we can't explain. If it turns out that this LBC finds much larger numbers of second-preimage keys than what we can explain with "weak key generation, lol", then we would know that there is a problem. We wouldn't necessarily be able to discover this with just "doing the math".

You don't have much to disagree with. I don't believe with certainty that a single PoW change will *not* be effective forever; I'm *unconvinced*. I'm expressing doubt, not belief in the negative.
Haven't other cryptocurrencies gone through PoW changes? Has it disciplined their miners, or indeed miners of any cryptocurrency? Granted, the others are minnows while Bitcoin is the big shark in the waters; it has *gravitas*. But does that satisfy me? No - (I think) we have evidence that PoW changes have at least once failed to discipline miners, so I think the standard of evidence for believing that it would work in Bitcoin should be higher.

I think I'm not explaining my thought process very well.


But that isn't the same as the *price*. In this thought experiment, what has value is the *blocks* (because of the timestamping service they provide), not the *tokens* mined. People may be willing to pay to put tokens into blocks, but they won't be willing to pay for the tokens themselves. The tokens may simply represent the existence of documents (proof-of-existence OP_RETURN type stuff); those tokens themselves have no value; what has value is that they are *known*. I can't sell you the number 42 - you already have it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:10:28


Not so fast. It would still be a timestamping oracle or something. You could still prove things like "Event X happened after time Y" for as long as blocks were being mined, even if the tokens produced were something nobody were willing to buy.
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:34:19


I don't think you know that even if you think you do. I don't think we know what the price elasticity of demand for block space is. It might be super elastic, in which case filling 2MB blocks would barely cost more than filling 1MB blocks. Either way, it seems obvious to me that the *cost per unit space* would be lower in a big-block regime, meaning that, *measured in space used*, it would be cheaper to run a DoS attack.

Nobody says a notary has to be paid in notarized documents. They can be paid in un-notarized pieces of paper with mugshots of long-dead guys on them.


That's the part where I disagree, and why I say Bitcoin (the network, not bitcoin the unit of account) does have intrinsic value. You could imagine a world where people would be willing to pay miners directly in USD (for example) for the service of mining a block. The system's value needn't be valued directly in its own frame of reference. Those 25 or 12.5 or whatever bitcoins that the post-bitcoin-failure (little b) miners get as a reward would be entirely uninteresting to them.
Heck, you could imagine altcoins (if they don't already exist) whose PoW function is the destruction of bitcoins. This would be similar: the notary-miners would be destroying USD (mediated by electricity) that people pay them for their service.


What is the price of air? Or of sea water? In my post-bitcoin-failure scenario, bitcoins would be just like air or sand or sea water: so plentiful that nobody cares, that it might as well be priced at zero and really the only thing you pay for is the service of putting the sand in bags or the air in pressurized cylinders.

Except that they *did* save Bitcoin from a similar attack, by realizing what a cryptocurrency needs to do *and what it doesn't need to do*. A cryptocurrency doesn't need to be Turing-complete floor wax. Bitcoin is structurally resistant to an *entire category* of attacks like this one against The DAO, that Ethereum isn't resistant to. It turns out that writing secure smart contracts in Ethereum is like writing a web browser in INTERCAL. It can be done, because that's what Turing-completeness means. It doesn't follow that it's easy to do so.

It's struck out now, but USD being legal tender is not literal intrinsic value. The not-so-intrinsic value of USD is a legal fiction, not a physical reality. If your government decided tomorrow to declare Bitcoin legal tender and USD not, Bitcoin would have this not-so-intrinsic value and the USD not. The USD's only *literally intrinsic* value is as fuel for heating or as a feedstock for metal refining.

To think something "might be" a scam, one has to have some sort of threat model, don't you think? What might a threat model be? What if one learns things about Bitcoin in just the right order that doesn't leave "holes" in one's understanding that can be filled with "It's obviously a scam, dude"?
I also never really went through a "Bitcoin is a scam" phase.

Go to [duckduckgo]( and "search" for sha256 "hello 1", sha256 "hello 2", etc. while noting the hash that DDG computes for you.
My toy PoW challenge for you is: find a number that, when you greet it, the greeting hashes to a string starting with four zeroes.
The zeroes are obviously not random - they're specifically selected for. But you can't start there; you can't just pick the zeroes and then randomly assign the rest of the digits. They have to happen to be there when you compute the hash. The other digits, the ones you aren't using as a criterion for testing the validity of the hash, they are random.

Your parenthetical remark is false. Surely you're aware of segregated-witness blocks, which increase the limit in a backwards-compatible way via a softfork, by effectively defining a new kind of block? "Extension blocks" are another proposal that proposes putting transactions into a sort of hyperspace where they're invisible to old nodes (thus breaking the link that still exists in SW and constrains the weight discount to a ratio of about 4:1 and allowing much bigger blocks). Unlike SW, such a system would need old-bitcoins to be spirited away into this hyperspace in order to take advantage of the larger block space, and optionally spirited back into the 1MB-max blocks. Almost like a cryptocurrency-within-a-cryptocurrency.

Money represents deferred barter. The fact that you get to defer it is of utility to you. Why should you inherently be able to claim the same value at any time of your choosing?
Not having any inflation (and I mean price inflation, not the lolbertarian's favourite obsession, monetary inflation) amounts to "getting something for nothing". If individual goods' prices rise or fall in relation to others, that's just a re-valuation of those goods and this argument doesn't apply.
By "getting something for nothing" you're denying lenders any return on their money. If you don't grant them a return, then they won't lend, because there is always risk (risk of last resort: an asteroid smashes your entire productive capacity overnight).
Are you ready to judge credit, in any form, as a thing that shouldn't exist? Because that's what the belief in inflation as an unconditional bad amounts to.

I'm not completely (or even at all - I just feel too unqualified to have an opinion) convinced but yes, they should. Apparently something something deflationary spiral.
(My counter-thought is that as people hoard their money under their mattresses, production of goods has to drop as the demand isn't there. As it drops, there are fewer good available and so one's think there'd be upward pressure on the price. My counter-counter thought is that this isn't just a straightforward DC feedback loop - information about goods and process is lagged, so you could expect instability depending on just what the lags and gains are: price oscillations and/or saturation at either zero or infinity. Instability is definitely bad for an economy.)

The metric is actually "most work". "Longer chain" is a proxy of the real metric, and a slightly inaccurate but much easier to explain to a newbie description of how the system works.
When people say, "longest chain", think of it not in terms of the number of blocks, but in the "distance" covered, in terms of work done. A block mined at a higher difficulty advances the chain by a longer "distance".

No, they want to *force you* to use their coin. That's why they want at least 51% of miners to support them, because miners would be their enforcers.

That makes the slope actually slippery rather than just fallaciously slippery.

To me there's no qualitative difference between a hard fork to 1000001-byte blocks, 2MB, 8MB, or 1GB. They're all hard forks, and I don't want them unless continuing without them is literally incompatible with Bitcoin continuing. (For example: a wizard *proves* that there are no possible blocks after 000000000000000001a4cfe... that satisfy the difficulty requirement.) Anything else is "[letting the AI out of the box]( Think of the superhumanly intelligent AI as an acronym-industrial complex agency (NSA, CIA, GCHQ, whatever) or central bank.

95% isn't "necessary" at all for hard forking. They can hardfork right now if they were serious about having their coveted bigger blocks. Altcoins get started every day with approximately zero buy-in from Bitcoin miners, and altcoins are, philosophically, also Bitcoin hardforks. (They typically fork the chain at an invisible point before the Bitcoin genesis block.)
If they're worried about getting their blocks orphaned if they have &lt;50% of miners on their side, they can just simultaneously softfork their hardfork: blocks MUST be &gt;1MB to be valid. Or, less facetiously, they can add some other rule that makes their blocks invalid in Bitcoin, like maybe their fork genesis block gets mined at lower difficulty. Then the Bitcoin miners will definitely not accidentally orphan them (though maybe they could still do it deliberately, but this costs money).

Yeah, but in its current form Bitcoin *cannot* support such levels of adoption. Maybe technologies can be invented to squeeze a whale into a matchbox, but we don't have that now.


Not persuasive. There's an oil milionaire right now who wants to buy products in other countries and he wants to buy it in Rial. The world isn't adopting the Rial to meet this oil baron's needs. The current financial system can deal with this "problem". It isn't really much of a problem at all.

A longer difficulty adjustment window has the advantage of a stronger consensus-converging force. Imagine if we had gotten into a situation where the UASF movement had caused a chain split, with a definite minority on the UASF chain. With a 2016-block window, the choice is stark: slog through months of slowly mining through the window before difficulty readjusts, or go along with hash power and accept that we're not getting segwit today. With a 144-block window (a day in normal mining time), it would be much less risky to follow through on the consensus-diverging threat.
Also, a shorter difficulty adjustment window [increases the gain of the feedback loop]( which makes oscillations and other markers of instability *easier* to provoke, not harder. Real life example: bumper-to-bumper traffic (high gain feedback as you try not to collide with the car in front of you) vs open freeway conditions (low feedback as a few car lengths between cars provides a safety buffer). During rush hour the distance between you and the car in front of you is constantly oscillating, but on the open freeway the distance is stable.

It's lending "more than you have" only if you selectively blind yourself to half of the exchange. In every case, when a bank lends someone money, that money is balanced by an asset (the debt by that person to the bank). The trade has an asymmetry though (and you pay for that difference with interest on the loan): the money the bank lends you is more liquid than the debt they get to put on their balance sheet. So if you analyse the situation only within a liquidity level (I think you could relate this to M0/M1/etc. money supplies) then there is an element of "lending more than you have". It is also this difference in liquidity that creates the danger of a run on the bank. But it's still fundamentally a question of *liquidity* and not of *solvency*.

That isn't what fractional reserve banking is at all. You're conflating a stock (loan amount) with a flow (interest payments).
Fractional reserve banking relies not on the interest payments somehow covering the loan principal to other borrowers, but on the loans returning to banks (not necessarily the same ones - but to banks as a class) as *deposits*. If I borrow money from the bank to build a factory, that money doesn't end up as $100 bills under my mattress; instead it first sits in my *bank account*, then I pay the construction company *into their bank account*. A fractional reserve ratio of 1/10th just implies that, on average, only 10% of money a bank lends to clients ends up outside the banking system. The other 90% collectively returns to banks as deposits, from where it can be used to finance more loans. There no "cheating" here. It's also mistaken to believe that Bitcoin is immune to fractional-reserve lending.

Chips getting smaller and more efficient doesn't matter. That just pushes the network hash rate up, rather than reducing the network's total electricity usage on mining.
We still asymptotically approach burning 25BTC/block in electricity. Cheaper electricity just means we use more of it, until we use just less than 25BTC worth of it every block.


So you have electricity that's free on the margin. Each additional kWh is free. All that leads to is that we install so much clean energy that we reach the point where the capital cost of tying up that equipment reaches 25BTC/10min.

You're not wrong in that it isn't consensus alone that gives Bitcoin value (retail banks also maintain internal consensus - through a centralized database). But consensus is a part of what gives it value. Bitcoin without consensus would be useless.
What gives it value is its ability to achieve and maintain consensus without requiring trusted third parties.

You seem to be expecting price stability to lead to *less* mining, not more. I find that hard to agree with. If miners prefer volatility to the stable (ish) prices we're seeing, they could just (voluntarily! this makes this option at least as good as having unstable prices) set aside a random amount of their coinbase at each block they find, and put it in a pool from which they also take a random amount at each block.

Why though? If you imagine a world that's more Bitcoin-heavy, where everything isn't ultimately denominated in a fiat currency but significantly also in bitcoin (little b), the funds "tied up" in payment channels are safe as houses, and it would be easy for a company like Starbucks to get a low-interest loan against that security.


It may be topologically centralized, but it isn't necessarily legislatively centralized unless governments get into the business of deciding who may operate a payment hub (and that may be hard to enforce). There's also no guarantee that these networks will be topologically centralized, and even less that they will be hierarchical with some super-hub at the center of everything.
Even if these networks turn out to be topologically centralized (and I don't find this self-evident that they will be), it's still a step short from the kind of "centralized" that modern banking is, in that anybody who can scrape together a few enthusiastic friends will be able to form their own Lightning hub. In banking, you get to choose your master. In Lightning, you have the option of being your own master even if you don't own a billion 2017 dollars.


Think rather of the early Internet, where maybe your first hop was via the local telephone company to your ISP (cue warbling modem sounds), but after that it was up to whatever routing agreements your ISP happened to have with the rest of the Internet. These ad hoc connections [might look somewhat centralized in that there will be obvious "fat paths"]( but there were also plenty of short-cuts between nearby cities, bypassing the trip to the national-level switching centers. Thinking of this "centralized" is deceptive since it discounts the fault-tolerant nature of such a network.

It may not be true that $200bn have been spent on bitcoin, but it is true that collectively hodlers are forgoing (up to! remember lost / destroyed coins) $200bn in order to hold onto their coins. They might not all be able to sell tomorrow to collect those $200bn, but each of them is individually valuing each of their bitcoins as worth more than $7k or whatever it is today. "Market cap" captures and quantifies that preference, although I agree it's a somewhat deceptive term - Bitcoin isn't a company, and we don't own shares in it.
Then again, a company whose market cap is $200bn also probably hasn't raised $200bn worth of capital, so it isn't too different there either.
If you want to calculate how much money was "put into" Bitcoin or into some company, you have to add up the money paid for all *newly issued* coins/shares. In Bitcoin that means adding up all the government-fiat money that miners sold their coinbase outputs for. All other trading has no effect on this "how much money was put in" figure: every time someone bought a non-coinbase coin, another person sold one that had been previously bought.

The only reason to include fees in your spam transactions if you're the miner who puts them in a block is if you want to hide the fact that you're spamming the blockchain - if you want it not to be obvious that those transactions are in any way different than normal, "organic" transactions.

Not necessarily. A controversial hardfork has a very real possibility of leaving *both* sides of the fork severely dumped, if not actually worthless.
That said, if you *actually own them* (as in: you possess a private key with which you can unilaterally spend them), you'll still be able to spend them on either side of the fork. In fact, you can spend them on *both* sides of the fork, which is exactly why a controversial hardfork is so dangerous to *both* sides of it.


If you think this controversial hardfork will occur (and controversial it is, and I don't see that controversy dissipating anytime soon, if at all, so the only variable here is whether it occurs or not) then you might want to consider flipping them to fiat or something, at least for the period during which any hardforking gets shaken out of the system.

I'm immediately skeptical if I notice even a whiff of the issuing party trying to directly profit from creating the currency. Bitcoin passes this test because it was the first cryptocurrency and seems to have succeeded in spite of its "experiment" status. It spent a long time being valued at basically zero.
To me it seems difficult to deliberately create a collectible item. Unless you make literally five cars of a kind, people seem rather to converge on a set of collectible items organically. And often it's the *bad* items that get used as money. I wish I could find the paper again, something about how, in a prison economy, good cigarettes get smoked, and the bad ones get used as money. People seem to reject a centralized decree that "Behold! This thing art now valuable!" by random parties. Governments get away with it because they're largely riding the coattails of what the society already converged on (gold coins), or they actually act with enough long-term integrity (connotation: predictability, rather than honesty necessarily) that they can unilaterally "move the market".

You are not defeated. You now know something you didn't know an hour ago; your mental model just got a little closer to reality (as you now see it).


I wanted to chime in on that too, that "extortion" is something that's "illegal" in some sense. I can't seem to think myself into the view that anything about a UASF would be "illegal" wrt miners. (Although I can potentially see "illegal" in how UASF nodes relate to other, non-UASF economic actors - they are risking a network split, the *taking of that risk* being as much of an act of aggression as I consider drunk driving to be: a violation of the non-aggression principle, to use ancap jargon.) I don't see it as "illegal" (wrt miners) because of the employer/employee-like relationship between validating nodes and miners. Validating nodes *validate*, and always have, and so I think it's perfectly legitimate for them to decide to further constrain the consensus rules against which they validate. It's just an extension of what they already do.
But you know what *would* be "extortion" in my mind? If butthurt anti-SW miners 51%-attacked an otherwise pro-SW network with deliberately empty blocks. The "crime" is not in whether the protocol allows it or not, but in the *intent*. The intent would pretty clearly be *to harm* the pro-SW network.


I think the whole "miners don't enforce the protocol, full nodes do" is quite a common sticking point. There are kernels of truth in the alternate view too, but the node-centric view is closer to how Bitcoin actually works at a technical level. (At the political level, miners clearly wield more than just a little influence.)

No, that needs more qualification. It's the electricity use *at the most efficiently realizable techology* for turning MWh into hashes, that confers security. So no, putting ENIAC to work mining Bitcoin is not going to add to the network's security. But every technological advance (like ASICBOOST) *reduces* security when it becomes available (specifically: to would-be attackers). When the effective network hash rate then increases after such a technology is introduced, that's just the network clawing back the security it once had (ramping up to the same electricity use as before, at a higher hash rate).

They obviously don't have an incentive to spam 100% of the block full of their own transactions, as then they'd lose out on any external fee inputs. Also probably not 0%, as that would result in lower external fees paid.

Miners don't *stop* you from double spending coins so much as *choosing which of two mutually exclusive spends gets committed to the ledger*.
Full nodes do the actual stopping, because whether they are mining nodes or not, if they are Bitcoin nodes, they will never ever ever accept a block chain that includes two spends of the same coin. Miners happen to run such full nodes because they want their blocks to be *accepted*, so that the block reward in those blocks is worth anything.

Bitcoin mining is subject to a feedback loop that forces block times towards 10 minutes. If energy efficiency improves, that makes mining more profitable, drawing more mining hardware into the game. Then the block time falls and miners make more money for a while... until the end of the 2016-block difficulty adjustment period, when the difficulty gets adjusted to a level where the next 2016 blocks would take 2 weeks to mine. Overall result: same total amount of electricity used.

No; the checksum algorithm for Bitcoin addresses is not engineered to provide good error-detection guarantees. There may well be addresses that have been used that are not protected against at least one particular typo or other transmission error. With the current checksum, it's merely *unlikely* that any particular address is vulnerable to undetected single-symbol corruptions; with a properly engineered checksum, it can be *guaranteed* that *all* N-symbol corruptions can be detected (for some N &gt; 0).

You speak with a certitude that I don't think is justified. We've never gone through a controversial (!) hard fork, so I don't think it's wise to speak in terms of "The preferred chain will" / "Nobody will lose" / "will still be worth" / etc.
Consider this: pre-fork coins (unspent outputs) will be spendable on both chains, so they have higher value than post-fork coins (merely having a choice has value). This means that any coins that are untainted by post-fork coinbase outputs (on either side of the fork) might trade at a higher price. If we see the emergence of an exchange for trading old bitcoins for new, do you agree that it's reasonable to expect the old bitcoins to trade at a premium? If that's true, then I don't think it's a far leap to find an incentive for miners to mine the 1MB chain. Perhaps marginal miners who can't make profit mining the 8MB chain, but can make a profit mining the 1MB chain, because after a week or three mining difficulty will adjust and they'll have a larger slice of a smaller pie.

Well, I think it's an *attack* on \*sha256d, but not a *compromise*. Bitcoin PoW grinding is still just a *brute force* attack on sha256d, so it has no special status here, I think.
ASICBOOST, on the other hand, is arguably a partial *compromise* of the Bitcoin PoW mechanism, if not of the underlying sha256d hash function. I'm undecided whether I personally think it's a compromise (orthogonal to the issue of patenting the technique).
An argument for "compromise": ASICBOOST, just like the rise of the ASICs and GPUs and FPGAs before them, is a centralizing force, that distorts the PoW mechanism from its intended (?) role as a fair lottery.
An argument against "compromise": If/when everybody uses the technique, the total electricity consumption will be the same as before, and it's MWh that confer security, not hashes per se. In this sense, ASICBOOST is on equal footing with hand-coded assembly in CPU mining, re-using the sha256 midstate, the march from CPU mining to GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs.

If that were true, then the blocksize doubling wouldn't have reduced fees. All that would have changed would be the cost of carrying the network: it would have doubled.
Okay, so maybe that's just the asymptotic worst case scenario: increasing max block size may not increase total fees by a factor of N, but by something smaller. Maybe sqrt(N). But that would imply that increasing max block size is a poor "scaling solution", since the resource requirements to carry the larger network increase faster than the network's size increases.

If we get to a point where the value of the Bitcoin network is constrained by the energy we can afford to "waste" in mining, then the price will tend towards the reciprocal of the mining reward. If that's dominated by the block subsidy, then that's a price doubling every "4 years" (actually a number of blocks). So that'd be $11k by 2030. To be at $500k by 2030, there needs to be some fundamental re-valuation, and we'd have to eat up more of our planetary energy budget in mining.
If you think we can afford to spend considerably more than about a gigawatt of electricity on Bitcoin mining, then you can rationally believe in $500k by 2030 (it would require ~ 40GW); if not, then you have some explaining to do. 40GW is roughly South Africa's total electrical generation capacity, and I imagine most other above-undeveloped countries that aren't China, the US or Russia, are roughly in that order of magnitude.

But it also gets broken. Codebases do not monotonically increase in quality; most eventually (!) reach an equilibrium between its developers fixing old bugs, and introducing new ones. That equilibrium point is determined by how "good" (terribly vague, sorry) those developers are. A codebase that has not yet reached this equilibrium point, i.e. one whose quality is still increasing, may pass into the hands of a new set of developers, under whose aegis that same codebase may be beyond the point of equilibrium, i.e. the quality is decreasing (they're introducing bugs faster than they're fixing old ones).

Your 5 cent transaction gets sent to 5000 full nodes, each of which is connected to, on average, 10 other nodes. Each transaction costs each node something of the order of 500 bytes of network data to every other node it is connected to. So for your 5 cent transaction, it costs the world 500*5000*10 = 25MB.
Further, your 5 cent transaction requires its outputs to be stored in the UTXO set of each node - in RAM, because if we're casually doing 5 cent transactions on-chain, they're going to be occurring too frequently to wait for disk for each one. You 5 cent transaction takes up something of the order of 1000 bytes on each and every full node (and this can't be pruned), so about 5MB in total.
Who pays for these resources?


Allowing this spam onto the blockchain would exclude this "huge part of the world population" from meaningfully*participating* in the Bitcoin network. Sure, they might *use* it - but merely as *users*. *Consumers*. If they can't afford a 50 cent fee for a Bitcoin transaction, they sure as hell can't afford to run a full node.

No, I think we're talking past each other. How Cloudflare treat sites that do choose to hide behind them (paid or not - the non-paying ones would just be loss leaders) doesn't tell us anything about whether they might be a protection racket or not.
A protection mob with burly guys as kneecap-breakers would also do well to actually prevent harm from coming to their "customers" as long as they pay. If they allow harm to come to their "customers", then that undermines their offer that nobody can refuse. This is a case where a gangster actually has an incentive to be honest (to keep their word anyway, if not truly "honest").
What's more interesting is how they interact with sites that *don't* hide behind them. (Paid or not.) I don't know how one would detect any subterfuge - it needn't be very direct. For all we know they could be secretly funding DDoS groups - even without any relationship. (Maybe by running bait sites that capitulate easily and pay the ransom, then disappear anyway.)

Yes, but it's a problem that can never be solved permanently. Imgur has to dedicate some staff to deleting images with hidden kiddie porn. But who exactly would be legally compelled to write a never-ending stream of special-cased code paths that avoid storing kiddie porn in the Bitcoin blockchain? The two are fundamentally different: Imgur is a company that owns computers that store putative kiddie porn, while Bitcoin is a network of users who run full nodes for themselves. Greg (CEO of Bitcoin) doesn't own your node and isn't responsible for what you happen to have stored on it. There's no point of control where one can apply pressure to take kiddie porn out of the blockchain, like there is at Imgur (they have offices and directors). And just because kiddie porn appears on one node's hard disk copy of the blockchain doesn't *strictly* imply that nother node in consensus with it stores that same string of bytes. What matters is being in consensus, not byte-for-byte identity of the serialization of blockchain data. (Although in practice today we have close to byte-for-byte identity for nodes in consensus.)

It isn't "unimportant". It's just way less important than the bigger risk.
But to answer directly: it isn't important because it's balanced by the "risk" of $5000 turning into $5500. One can construct financial instruments that trade away the one risk in exchange for the other, leaving just a residual risk that derives from the *slight* asymmetry of the two possibilities.


Merchants manage risk all the time though. (Literal) mines hedge against price changes by forward-selling their production, or by holding a portfolio of derivatives based on their product. It doesn't matter what they "want". What matters is what's profitable or unprofitable. If merchants think they can turn a profit by selling in bitcoin while managing the risk, they will do so (if they're not put off by other factors).
One perfectly way to manage risk, that many merchants choose, is just "let Bitpay / whoever deal with the bitcoin risk - we just deal in fiat".

I don't think you'd have to alter the chain. Maybe it would suffice to *encode* the problematic parts of the blockchain data differently, so that the encoded representation no longer contains kiddie porn? I could imagine special-case code in node software that processes the affected transactions through the surgical gloves of a hash function, so the actual kiddie porn data is never present - or at least not persistently.

Is the fact that the vast majority of workplace deaths are men proof that men are discriminated against? No, it isn't proof of that. Discrimination is only one of many possible factors that could explain phenomena like a significant imbalance in the founding of startups, their funding, or workplace deaths. And just because it's a possible factor doesn't mean that it is a factor in a particular instance, so the 86.5/13.5 split is not "proof". At best it's a prompt to *dig deeper*, perhaps in a search for proof of discrimination.
Obligatory on-topic drag: Do you think that (what looks to me like) a nearly overwhelming imbalance in the Bitcoin community with men being in the vast majority is "proof" of discrimination? Or could it be that men, *on average*, are more risk-tolerant?

At least you'd be able to tell that the payment isn't going to whom it's claimed to be going to.


It isn't just the root CAs. Other points of failure are intermediate CAs and the various web browsers that come pre-loaded with root CA certificates.


How do you know a *novel* certificate is legit? You can't; you're stuck having to trust the highly centralized PKI.
A more PGP-like infrastructure would not present such high-value targets (root CAs, browser vendors), and you would have a more meaningful ability to chose whom to trust. With x509-based PKI, not only is the infrastructure hierarchically centralized, but also its protocols encourage *concentration*. There's little incentive to have your certificate signed by any CA but the most popular one whose signature you can afford to buy. The protocol itself forces you to privilege just one signer.

Let's take that "[square root of the number of people half half of &lt;thing&gt;]( law. I have no idea if it applies to ownership of money.
If we model the distribution of bitcoins as 21000000\*2^-x / 8000000000^(0.5^x) with x being a sort of percentile of wealth (but from the perspective of wealth - i.e. at x=1 it says 98443 people each own 117 bitcoins, on average) then we want to solve for:
21000000\*2^-x / 8000000000^(0.5^x ) = 0.1
I don't know how to do this exactly, but plotting the graph shows me the solution is about x = 0.2648. At that point, 174775892 people own 17478596 bitcoin. This would put OP into the 97.8th percentile.

My experience has been different. My experience has been that if you keep memory safety in mind from the start, you rarely add memory bugs inadvertently, and when you do, they're relatively easy to find and fix. valgrind is your friend here.
On the flip side, if you neglect memory safety until after you have a few dozen lines of code, and don't maintain a strong focus on regression testing (including with tools like valgrind, which are not just about malloc/free), then you never "get ahead of the plane". That's when you curse C when instead you should curse your lack of due diligence when using that language.

There's no way to be sure of that. pi is very much *not* a random number, so it isn't just a matter of sampling enough digits to asymptotically aproach probability = 1 that a given string will appear. While the digits of pi are an infinitely long series, and a non-repeating one at that, that doesn't mean there's much entropy in them. In fact, there's nearly none. Reasoning: this infinite series can be compressed into no more than a dozen mathematical symbols. pi = limit{n-&gt;infinity}(sum{i = 1...n}((-1)^i \* 4/(2\*i-1)))

No technology can give you faster on-chain transaction confirmations while preserving the security properties of Bitcoin. It's going to be 10 minutes on average for each additional confirmation. You could use an altcoin with faster block cadences, but that doesn't actually change your assurance that a confirmed transaction is final: think of it in terms of electricity burned (which is what confers security) to mine the blocks under which your tx is buried, rather than in terms of the number of blocks (which is quite arbitrary).


On-chain tx fees seem to be hovering around 5 satoshi/byte these days. For a normal, reasonable (i.e. not a sweep of 1000 faucet outputs) transaction that would be something of the order of 5000 satoshi for tx fees. 0.00005 BTC. I think that's as close to "free" as you're going to get on any cryptocurrency that more than a handful of fanboys actually use.

I want to ground this in the concrete case of c-lightning, and not software in general. c-lightning is not the sort of software that I expect to be maxing out my computer's resources. It's the sort of software I expect to be doing nothing most of the time, using minimal resources. My computer's resources are there for Firefox to hog up. (Oh do I wish that every software project didn't have this "we're wasting the user's resources if we don't hog allllll of it up as if we're the only process in the whole wide universe!!!11" attitude.)
And in fact, the word `pthread_create` only occurs in some test code in c-lightning. So I don't think (in general valid, IMHO) criticisms about C's thread-safety are relevant in this case.


That's true, and a valid criticism. I'm not trying to write a complete apology for C. Rather I'm arguing that the C ecosystem has a *very, very mature* set of tooling that surrounds it, that can to an extent mitigate the weaknesses of the language. For example, the "only during runtime" objection has a counter: you use coverage tools to find the parts of your code that your tests don't cover. This isn't perfect of course, because the number of paths that execution can take is larger than the number of lines of code. But you can do better than just flying blind.

You aren't giving evidence to support your claims. You're giving random, decontextualized stats that have *multiple possible interpretations*. You can't just short-circuit to your ideologically preferred conclusion; to support your claims you have to show why your preferred interpretation is correct *to the exclusion of other plausible interpretations*.

I don't think you know what my beliefs are at all. You're the only one here whose beliefs really are in play here. You believe that women are systematically discriminated against, and you believe that your random factoids should self-evidently and irrefutably justify those beliefs, because you're so invested in them.

What does that have to do with the claim that "women are not discriminated against", or the stronger one that "women enjoy a 2:1 hiring preference"? Don't be so defensive man, I'm not asserting that discrimination does or does not occur, I'm asking you what VCs' *opinion* is on whether it occurs. (And as a corollary, why their opinion is relevant.)


Yeah, and that still doesn't prove that the cause is *discrimination*. And startups getting funded is not a matter of "hiring", it's a matter of *investment*. To disprove the claim that women enjoy a 2:1 hiring preference you'd have to do something like zoom into those companies that VCs invest in (male or female founders alike) and look at their hiring practices. And then you'd have to ask VCs whether they're aware of what you find.


Stats like these are wholly specious without reference to stats about the gender breakdown of people who *attempt* to raise capital for their startups. And stats about who even attempts a startup in the first place. And 86.5/13.5 split in *funding* could turn out to confirm a preference for women if pre-funding startups themselves were split 95/5. I don't know what the actual numbers are, but I would be surprised at neither 95/5 nor 75/25. (I would be surprised at 25/75. What would you be surprised by?)

You didn't read the article I linked, did you? x.509 is very much a centralizing force, as there's a clear notion of "up" in the hierarchy of CAs. Not so in the OpenPGP web of trust. x.509 = a (single) global tree of certificates; OpenPGP = a directed graph of certificates, where everyone can have their own, *different* trust roots.


Which is a worthless signature if your threat model includes parties that are able to coerce root CAs or your browser vendor.


An is does not imply an ought. That there is currently no alternative does not mean that no alternative should be implemented. I've been considering adding an OpenPGP signature scheme to BIP70 messages, and one reason I haven't is because it seems to me like nobody really uses it.

I also have misgivings about fixed supply, but it's graven in stone for as long as Bitcoin is Bitcoin, so there's little point in crying over that bit of spilt milk.


Beware of conflating all the different M's. There's M0, M1, etc. I think bitcoins are like M0, and I don't see why M1, M2, etc. would never be a thing in this world. Even right now, I wonder if all those exchange wallets out there count as M1 - you actually have an IOU from the exchange to redeem it in bitcoin (M0), but that entitlement you own is *not bitcoin*, although it is denominated in it.
Also consider that layered technologies on top of Bitcoin (closest example: Lightning networks) can subdivide satoshis, although their renderings onto the Bitcoin blockchain (as when a LN channel opens or closes) obviously have to be rounded to satoshis.


I no longer think that the sort of deflation that Bitcoin's long-term relevance might trigger is necessarily harmful. To me it looks like a negative feedback loop: if the Bitcoin economy overheats (same money chasing more goods) then prices in bitcoin will go down. If the price at which you can sell a good goes down, do you produce more or less of it? You produce less, which is a stabilizing force in a context where the economy as a whole is offering more goods.
I'm not settled on this deflation though, and am keen to see nuanced arguments for or against eny position, as long as it isn't the bog standard "muh deflationary spiral" textbook argument, which doesn't distinguish between the general price level dropping because of a reduction in money supply (as when debt contracts) and price levels dropping because of rising productivity.

The only reason the US Dollar (or any fiat currency for that matter) needs "backing" is because its units are so cheap to produce: seigniorage. Neither gold nor bitcoin need "backing" because the [economic profit]( of producing them tends towards zero. Every unit produced is "honest". Bitcoin perhaps even more so than gold, because of its two-week difficulty readjustment. If anyone figures out how to transmute digital lead into digital gold (bitcoin), their advantage won't last long because difficulty will just rise to make it a wash between transmuting more lead into gold or not bothering. With analog gold such a breakthrough in production techniques would only be compensated for in a long feedback loop involving market signals.

The one where they claim in interviews to have "implemented a fix". "Implemented a fix" generally implies that you wrote some code, not that you applied a change made by an upstream project.


Decontextualized like that, I agree that it's a stretch to call out a particular commit as a copyright violation. The copyright violation (if it exists, IANAL) is in the claim to have "implemented a fix". Add to that that it apparently isn't the first time something like this has happened, and deadalnix having apparently discussed his desire to strip all attribution to Bitcoin Core from the fork.


No, gmaxwell is pissed because jj reneged on his word. He apparently agreed that the vulnerability should not be published until the fix was deployed, and that he would not publish it during his talk. Then he did anyway. If the Coreistas had known he'd go back on his word like that, they would likely have rearranged their personal schedules to get 0.15 released a few days sooner. (And remember that release candidates have been available for a few weeks now. Core *did* have the fix ready to release.) Core was ambushed, not fairly beaten to the scoop.


It can.


Not being allowed to pretend to have written some piece of code that you didn't is not a "special attribution requirement".


It's really simple: don't claim to have written code that others wrote and have kindly made available to you to use in your own project.

I don't think that can account for the observations, because sales-in-bitcoin goes *down* too, when bitcoin tanks. (Or did, at least, back when I heard about these numbers.) Unless you want to assert that the number of people using bitcoin decreased with the price. Which is not an entirely unreasonable supposition, but my intuition is that it's false - I rather think that the choice to use bitcoin is "stickier" than that.


Why would people just entering the Bitcoin ecosystem because they're caught up in the mooning hype, immediately turn around and spend their dearly bought coins? IMHO the more parsimonious explanation is that it's HODLers "cashing out" because they have a sense of when their coins are worth a lot relative to other times (past *and future*).


The numbers I'm thinking of were from approximately the 2014 period. I can't link to anything because it was just statements by merchants, and casual tweets and verbal statements at that. You can quibble with that if you want, but I choose to take their word for it.

What exactly do you mean by "10:1" here? The majority of victims of violent crimes are men, not women, so it can't be that. But I don't see how a 10:1 ratio in perpetrators of violent crimes points to *discrimination*.
So no, whatever it is you mean by "10:1", I'm pretty sure I don't consider it "proof that women are discriminated against". Discrimination is not the only possible cause of differences.


Violence isn't a factor in VC funding of startups, or in workplace deaths of loggers and fishermen. With violence out of the picture, in what way(s) are men "more able to dish out discrimination" in the world of VC finance, logging or fishing operations?
A greater risk-tolerance among men explains (at least in part) their greater representation on the "startup scene", fishing and logging crews, and cryptocurrency communities. Their greater capacity for unaided violence (i.e. without weapons) does not explain these phenomena. As for a putative greater capacity to dish out discrimination: well I just gotta say - citation needed.

"Consensus" can refer to two things in this space: social consensus, where a tribe meets and the elders propose things and everyone discusses stuff and at the end of the night everyone's hungry so they choose to go along with whatever seems like the plural proposal. Ultimately everyone agrees (with varying amounts of enthusiasm) and the motion is carried.
Then there is computing consensus, which is about *all* nodes on a distributed network reaching the *exact same state* as each other. Designing protocols to achieve this is not easy. Besides blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, other examples of consensus systems include: database systems where multiple "servers" need to hold the same data in their tables; Internet routing, where the entire Internet *should* (but in practice doesn't always) agree on where a given host is; distributed version control systems like git or mercurial, where being able to identify the complete and exact state of a hierarchy of files by the commit ID is the *sine qua non*.

Not me you're replying to, but I do believe that. I believe in "everything which is not expressly forbidden is allowed" - without having to have a licence". I find it offensive that states arrogate to themselves the "right" to forbid-by-default (which is what requiring a licence is) voluntary trade between people.
What makes "running a business" *running a business*? If I sell you a bicycle I no longer use, am I running a business? What about if enjoy woodworking, and offer discount tree felling services for cheap access to wood? Am I running a business? Or what if I write software in exchange for money, does that constitute running a business? Should I need a licence to practice my hobbies or profession?
Now if you want to argue that certain specific kinds of businesses should require a licence, that's another matter. Maybe you want to say that operating a bitcoin/USD exchange should require having a licence to do so. I happen to disagree even with that, but I don't find that anywhere nearly as offensive as the idea that *by default*, one does not have the fundamental right to run a business.

Why on earth do you think Lightning nodes will have to have such uptimes? Channels don't get broken just because a node goes offline for a few minutes, or hours, maybe even days.
Even if they do get broken, how many transactions do you think it's reasonable to presume would have flowed across the channel before it breaks? One? Ten? A thousand?


I think that's an entirely reasonable factor. Why do you think 2000 transactions will be "a lot" (which I'm guessing by the way you emphasize "-at least-") once the Lightning network matures?


Do you understand the difference between the transport layer (TCP) and the application layer (Lightning channels)? Lightning channels don't, in principle, need to be settled out and re-established just because your computer gets rebooted. (It may be necessary if your hard disk *crashes*, but even then, you could restore channel state from backups. Or ask your channel peer for the most recent state.)


Why do you think the Lightning network won't be able to scale its capacity with anticipated demand? I think it's entirely reasonable that Lightning-participating vendors might rebalance or fund channels in advance of anticipated Christmas peaks for example.


You don't seem to have much of a clue how it works though, so I don't think you or anyone else should take your prognosis very seriously.
It's possible (nay, it's *likely*) that Bitcoin as it is today + Lightning in the form that's just starting to come online, alone, can't service all 8 billion humans on Earth. But it can take us way beyond where we can go with an unlayered Bitcoin alone where all coffee purchases stay on-chain. Having difficulty scaling up to all 8 billion humans would be a nice problem to have. In the meantime, let's work on getting to 8 million.

Okay, but how is the USD today any different than bitcoin here? 33% of bitcoins aren't just suddenly going to get OP_RETURN disappeared.
And how much of this contraction was a contraction in *debt* rather than in dollar notes and coins?


And yet this is contradicted by empirical numbers from bitcoin-accepting vendors. People spend *more*, not less, of their bitcoin when it's mooning. They know it's mooning and so they decide to spend it while they get a lot of goods for their money. That's a [negative feedback]( and negative feedback promotes stability.
If people hoard their money instead of building factories, then pretty soon production of goods goes down and catches up with how quickly money is "disappearing", and prices cease to drop further. I assert without proof (as it's just a prompt for further thinking - I'm not really trying to "win points" here) that today's economy consists of much tighter feedback loops than the 1930s economy did, so that this process would occur much faster today if it even got started. What are inventories like today vs 1930?


No, what matters is that today I could buy 100 liters of milk (or anything else) with the money I'd spend on a cellphone, but if I waited a month I'd have to sacrifice only the ability to by 90 liters of milk to get that same cellphone. Yet people still buy cellphones. Choice of currency is immaterial here - only relative prices between goods matter.

I think the drop in PoW-equivalent days is a result of large chunks of hash power coming online. The "huge surge" is just the chain making progress at 1 PoW-equivalent day per real life day, without any large changes in the mining technology used. I don't know what the drop in mid-2012 reflects (maybe FPGAs? or maybe just formerly idle hash power coming back online in response to a rising price?), but the cliff starting in early 2013 reflects ASIC miners coming online in large numbers, making the nearly 5 years of accumulated work nearly insignificant.

No; because the block interval is regulated by a feedback loop, it would always take approximately the same amount of **time** for the current total hash power to rewrite the last N blocks (for some "small" number N over which the difficulty doesn't change too much).

Or should they send mean letters from their lawyers asking them to please comply with the existing licence, which is the only thing which grants Apple the right to use the GCC code at all.

Copyright licences don't *require* things, they *allow* things. The default is that all rights to the work belong *exclusively* to the copyright holder (which defaults to being the author of the work). So you start with being allowed to do nothing, and then the licence *grants* you rights (which may be subject to conditions) which you didn't have before.
So the question is not, "Does the MIT licence *require* deadalnix to preserve authorship?" It is, "Does the MIT licence (and his local laws!) *allow him to misrepresent it*?"


By default, I would agree with you. The git Author: header records who made the commit, not who wrote its content. But if it's true that deadalnix has been talking about stripping attribution to Bitcoin Core from all the Bitcoin ABCDEFG code, then this looks less like a merely technical detail and more like an active misrepresentation.

You're presupposing that anarchism motivates the person advocating for legal action. You are mistaken that it is necessarily so, but let's let that slide for the moment.
Even if one is motivated to use Bitcoin by one's anarchist leanings, the fact is that one is presently paying taxes that fund, among other things, the justice system. Expecting an authority (which one happens to believe is based on an illegitimate social "contract") to take action to enforce one's rights is not hypocritical *even if one is an anarchist*, as long as one is, in fact, paying one's taxes.
It would only be hypocritical if one were also evading one's tax burden, but I see no evidence of that. The objection to governments is that they are based on a *forced* exchange, not that their services have no value.

21 million might not have been a "goal" but just a random result. It isn't even 21 million exactly, because of how the block subsidy will get rounded *down* several halvenings from now.
21 million (minus rounding residues) is just the number you happen to get when you add all the block subsidies up. When you start at 50BTC/block for 210000 blocks (exactly), then 25BTC/block for another 210000, etc., you approach 21 million in the limit to infinity. Why 210000? I have no idea, maybe it was to "engineer" the infinite sum to 21M, maybe it's just a round number and Satoshi likes the numbers 3 and 7, maybe it's so that you can encode any bitcoin transaction value as BCD in a 64-bit integer.

It definitely is expensive. Each block costs 25BTC to produce (the price we pay to miners, they of course hope *their* costs are below 25BTC), and contains of the order of 1000 transactions. Whether you're explicitly paying transaction fees or not, each transaction costs 25mBTC, or about 6USD to include in the blockchain. *Somebody* pays that, and it's everyone who holds bitoin, essentially by having their holdings diluted in order to pay the miners.

I'm not convinced that there is a weakness. Bitcoin already has an immune system that would defend against this attack - if only we would let it do its work! It's called transaction fees. The longer and harder they attack the network with their "stress test", the more expensive it will become as average fees ramp up as people with *actual* currency / settlement layer (take your pick) usage pay to get their transactions confirmed. Those have far more value to their senders than individual "stress test" transactions do, so I would expect, in the long term, for "real" transactions to outbid BSey "stress test" transactions.

Once we reach the final mining stages where the block subsidy is just a small part, those $330M don't just disappear - miners still need to get paid!

Only a change in what gets transmitted. It doesn't change what a valid block is, so it isn't a consensus rule change.


Does it change which blocks are valid? If not, then no, it isn't.


Yes, that's a consensus rule change, but the change is in the direction of being *more restrictive*. Relaxing that rule is in the opposite direction - that of being more permissive. That makes all the difference. Whether it was originally thought to be temporary (even if by Satoshi (PBUH) himself) pales in importance, by comparison, IMHO.

But I can't help feeling that even a purely defensive PoW-change hard fork would be a Pyrrhic victory: a large part of the opposition to segwit2x (at least a large part of mine) is because it's a hardfork that isn't existentially necessary [\*] for Bitcoin's survival. Hardforking to fight a hardfork, then, would yield at best a hollow victory.
[\*] I don't consider PoW change "existentially necessary". I'm referring more to something like "mathematical impossibility of progress" - the only contrived example I can come up with is if block \ has hash X, and then someone mathematically proves that there can be no block after that that satisfies the required difficulty criterion.

And to me the only way to achieve that resistance necessarily also implies resistance to tampering by *anyone*, even by charismatic leaders with close ties to the project itself. (A stronger/scarier adversary has (or should be assumed to have) a superset of the powers of a weaker one, so defending against the stronger one has to include defending against the weaker one.)

Bear in mind we're not dealing with a good-faith stress test here, IMHO it should more properly be referred to as a denial-of-service attack. These guys are spamming the network with transactions not with the goal of figuring out and then fixing bottlenecks, but with the goal of convincing people that "we need bigger blocks!!111" It's a political act, not a technical one. And that adds a (politically) adversarial quality to the "stress test" that isn't present when you flood your own infrastructure (as in, you own and operate it yourself, you're not being a free rider).
There's no ramping here, the "stress test" gets announced with great fanfare, and IMHO a week here and there isn't "a significant time".


I happen to hold that view, but that isn't my argument here. What I am arguing here is that this "stress test" isn't valid research. It's just political posturing - a bit like blackmail: "We'll make your network unusable if you don't give us what we want!"

git is already stronger. Github is just one way of accessing and managing source code repositories. Github could be gone tomorrow and there'd still be thousands of copies of the Bitcoin Core code on people's computers, and it would all be verifiably untampered. git uses cryptographic primitives to link versions of a codebase's history together, and while this was intended mainly to ensure integrity in the face of simple equipment failure, it also does a good job detecting any intentional tampering.
If Github were gone tomorrow, Gavin and Luke and Gregory et al would just do what the Linux kernel devs do and pull branches from each other, or, heck, even *email* bundles of patches among each other.

The goodness or badness of a change isn't limited to just the parameter change, but to *what kind* of change it is: whether it's a hardfork or a softfork. Assuming we currently had no blocksize limit, introducing a 1MB limit would be a softfork, which means the miner community voluntarily chooses never to produce bigger ones, but what they *do* produce is still perfectly valid according to any pre-softfork nodes. Such a parameter change would arguably be "bad" if it ended up creating significantly higher fee pressure, but the main thing here is that you can judge the change on the parametric aspect in isolation. Not so with a hardfork - with a hardfork we can't just limit our argument to whether changing the blocksize limit is "good" or "bad", but we *have to* also argue about whether changing is is *so much better* that it justifies the badness of hardforking (producing a blockchain that's no longer valid according to pre-hardfork nodes).

Gosh, really, is this necessary?


If the majority continued mining on the larger side, then introducing the limit *fails*. You don't seem to understand the term "hardfork". Introducing a limit results in blocks picked from a *strict subset* of what's possible to pick from without the limit - that makes it a *softfork*. All post-softfork blocks are also valid pre-softfork blocks. Not so with hardforks.


It isn't just about "leaving people behind". It's also about *what the default should be*. If the people who want to introduce a limit fail in their initiative, *only they* are "left behind". But if you want to *relax* a limit, you're willing to throw *others* to the wolves if you're willing to relax it without consensus.

Your DNA boils down to just a big number, and if a person (natural or legal) happens to know that number, they don't really know anything about you other than that they've (maybe) seen you before. They can know that DNA-person 8372767358725765729857 is a child of DNA-person 273767582375987582, but that just defines nodes in a heredity graph. You need more to connect those nodes with an actual identity. Finding DNA at a crime scene is one such "leak" of useful identity into the genetic relations graph. Same if you were to get profiled during a hospital visit or during a traffic stop.
As with bitcoin, the on- and off-ramps are the important bit. Genetic identities per se are as good as anonymous; they only become de-anonymized when you integrate them with real-world interaction intelligence. But you're also right to point out that such information leaks are transitive - being sloppy with your own info doesn't just endanger your own genetic anonymity, but also that of many people around you.

I'm not talking about government forcing this. I'm talking about Bitcoin legitimists doing this themselves, Uncle Tom style. Saying to themselves, "We must self-regulate and prostate ourselves to government scrutiny lest they refuse to grant us permission."


I'm not the one conflating banks with government. In fact I think governments are potentially greater allies to ideologically-motivated Bitcoin people than we tend to give them credit for. *If* you accept the premise that banks "own" governments (as in regulatory capture, not literal ownership), then Bitcoin would be a tool with which a government (which might not want to be "owned") can extract more political concessions from the banks in exchange for the licence-as-barrier-to-entry.
But no, the Bitcoin legitimists think we need to align ourselves with bank/government hegemony, thereby both failing to negotiate from a position of strength, and undermining Bitcoin's usefulness to a potential ally (regulators with a social mandate).

That isn't contingent on a previous deposit, and also not on whether the bank is subject to KYC laws. Pablo Escobar can demand his 32 million dollars "back" from you whether anyone actually deposited it in your account or not, and be very persuasive either way.
You're introducing red herrings that only obfuscate that there's no inherent *security* exposure in letting anyone deposit any amount of money in anyone's account. The security exposure in your Pablo Escobar scenario comes from his willingness to use violence to get what he wants (rubber hose cryptanalysis) and having physical access to you, not from allowing random deposits.
Or do you think Pablo is just going to walk away and accept "no" when the cashier tells him that he can't take the deposit because something something KYC laws? KYC laws add *nothing* you your somatic security here, let alone to the security of your money.

You think you've found a double standard, but you haven't. The situations are fundamentally different, so it's appropriate that different standards apply. "Corruptions" (depending on what exactly you mean by the word in this context) in the corporate space is "shrewd" and not "a scandal" because (most) corporations transact with each other and with individuals on a voluntary basis and do not have a social contract with the citizenry to act as their agents. Governments are in such a social contract - you could bluntly say they are our "employees". It's the putative foundation of democracy - they govern with consent of the people. When (more or less democratic) governments are corrupt, it's an example of the principal/agent problem, where the agent (government) is acting against the best interests of its principal (the people). When a corporation is "corrupt", it's just inter-agent conflict.
Remember: whether we like it or not, we *all* have a relationship with our governments. So when they're corrupt, they're directly fucking *us* over. When Trump stiffs a contractor, he's fucking over that contractor, but the rest of us aren't involved - nowhere near directly anyway.

If it's to be $700k and for mining to be in equilibrium with that price, bitcoin mining would have to consume 500GW constantly, at $0.1/kWh. That's fully half the global electricity production, within an order of magnitude.
I think anyone who thinks this is compatible with an economy most of us want to live in is nuts. That economy would be significantly smaller than today's, since those 500GW spent on mining is 500GW not spent on factories producing cars and whatnot.

500GW with solar power, hmm?
Okay, let's calculate. Approximately 200W/m^2 - generously.We're paving the Sahara here, and it'll be perpetual summer, and the panels will form a continuous sheet with no gaps in between.
500GW / 200W/m^2 = 2.5e9m^2 or 2500km^2.
That's only slightly less than Kazakhstan. Where are you going to put all these panels, and do so on short notice? Got any idea what this will do to both the local and global climate - having a big blob of low albedo that wasn't there before?
And then that's 500GW *peak*. I.e. at noon. But actually we have this thing called "night" and the 500GW of mining would have to continue into this. So actually we need ~1500GW peak (spread across timezones), or about 7500km^2. So basically Australia. You think this is going to happen anytime soon?

Consensus rules graven in stone with a brick on the "No rule changes" button is the way we get to resist three-letter acronym agency interference in *our money*.

If these people love using 0-conf transactions, then they're already off-chain. By definition of what 0-conf is: the transaction isn't confirmed into a block, which links to others in a chain.
They like 0-conf transactions because they can't afford to wait 10 minutes for even the first confirmation, not because 0-conf transactions are cheap. So on-chain transactions are definitely not for them. So why do you want to shoehorn them into using on-chain transactions? I bet you they'll love Lightning networks even more than they love 0-conf transactions (once they're available to use).

They're not equivalent at all. Bitmain has actual control over Bitcoin Cash; in contrast, Blockstream does not have any *control* over Bitcoin.

Right, you've identified a flaw with a zeroth-order approximation of the future. Let's go first-order then: what do you think happens to a global economy when the price of a universal input (such as electricity) goes strongly up?
You haven't addressed the qualitative nature of my argument, only (correctly) pointing out that it isn't an exact number. It was never meant to be an exact number.
What percentage of the global electricity production do you think bitcoin mining can absorb while still being a price taker, i.e. without imposing significant price increases on the rest of the electricity market (which involves basically everything)?


You can't bring an extra 500GW online overnight. You can bring 500GW of demand online much faster than you can bring matching supply online. And most of these breathless "OMG Bitcoin to $infinity by Q3 2018!!!11" "predictions" are about imminent moonings, not what we might see in 2040.

It would be non-fallacious to refuse to debate Adolf Hitler on the merits of estabishing a jewish state somewhere in the middle east, because the things he'd done in the past that you're attacking would be directly relevant to whether he'd be honest in this debate. But if the debate were about saving puppies? I dunno, wasn't he supposed to have been fond of animals? His antisemitic views aren't relevant there.
In the case of "Doctor" Wright, however, everything we see him do is by definition public and related to his image, unless you happen to be a personal friend, or family. And since his deceptions have involved specifically the perception people have of him, all of what he publicly does is subject to this non-fallacious ad hominem reasoning. He has a credibility deficit, and it's up to him, not us, to bridge that gap. He needs us; we don't need him.

Being able to conjure up Bitcoin isn't all *that* remarkable as many in this sub seem to think it is. What I got from what he said was not a sense of downplaying Satoshi or puffing himself up (sure, he does that too, but this isn't the best example of it), but that Bitcoin is a confluence of relatively unremarkable pieces [1] that each have existed individually for at least about 10 years before Satoshi published the white paper.

But yes, spamming the mempool would be almost exactly as easy with bigger blocks as it is now. Only average fees will presumably be lower so a mempool-spamming attack would be even cheaper to execute than it is now.


Yes, I believe that demand for block space is almost perfectly elastic: that demand will rapidly fill up any block space that's available.

Yes, there are *so many* things we would *love* to be able to fix properly, that we haven't been able to because it would require hardforking, that are more important for the long-term technical health [\*] of Bitcoin than some stupid can-kicking block size increase could ever be.
[\*] Technical health only. I remain unconvinced that the benefits would exceed the costs of *ever* doing a Bitcoin hardfork unless it's literally an existential do-or-die question (and I find it really hard to contrive such a true existential hazard - "ermahgerd blocks are full" is not one of them).

You can apply the same reasoning to a SW transaction appearing in a block.
You can't fully verify transactions in the no-pi alternate Bitcoin universe, because you don't know what the full consensus rules are. You can't fully verify transactions in the segwit universe because you're choosing not to enforce those known consensus rules. The result is the same though: falling back to "trusting" miners to include only valid transactions (because something something incentives).

I speak only for myself but I'm still against hardforks. And since the NY "agreement" implies a hardfork, I'm against it for that reason (along with the other, just as concerning reason that it was a top-down smoky boardroom "deal").
Bitcoin is still *possible* without a block size hardfork, so this doesn't fall into my "existential crisis" clause for acquiescing to hardforks. (An example of such an existentially necessary hardfork would be something like someone manages to prove that no sha256 hash can contain more than 20 leading zeroes, but the network difficulty would require it.)

That also acquiesces us to the suits. The formula to destory a cryptocurrency's trust will then be clear: pick some miner to shore up, to get them into a dominant position. Then get them to "demand" one hardfork or another. Repeat as necessary until the original consensus is splintered into 50 Balkanized mini-currencies.
I see only two plausible opinions that are compatible with Bitcoin remaining *our* money: either you believe the BIP148 UASF will "win" and so you support it, or you believe it will fail and you support 1MB forever (no segwit for now, no 2MB hardfork). Anything else surrenders our money to suits.

Yes, that's correct, first SW signaling needs to be maintained for the duration of the period 1 August - 15 November, during which hopefully 95% of blocks in a readjustment interval signal support, then another 2016 blocks (2 weeks if difficulty has equilibrated with network hash rate) to get through the LOCKED_IN state, and then finally segwit will be active.
It's only the initial tranche of 2016 blocks that will be slow (assuming there's at least 25% of the original hash rate on that chain). The difficulty adjusts by a factor up to 4x (or is it 2x in the downwards direction...) to keep the average block time at 10 minutes.

You're right that their motivation is not to "keep tx throughput low". Their motivation is to make as much profit as they can.

@_date: 2017-05-29 19:28:14
If they do decide to attack the UASF chain (with, for example, empty blocks), they may succeed in displacing transactional activity, but their hash power will be contributing to the UASF chain reaching the required 2016 blocks signaling for SW before 1 November.

If you look at the [reference implementation]( of BIP148 you'll see that it requires blocks to signal for segwit only from 1 August to 15 November. If the BIP148 chain fails to get 95% of a 2016-block window signaling for segwit, then segwit fails to activate during that window (and actually permanently for this iteration, because the current deployment times out).
If there are only, say, 1000 blocks in total on the BIP148 chain from 1 August to 15 November, then the segwit activation probably fails. (Unless: those 1000 blocks were the last 1000 blocks of a difficulty readjustment interval and 916 of the previous 1016 had already signalled for segwit. Which is incompatible with BIP148 causing a chain split.)

The false dilemma is between high transaction fees and high bandwidth costs. Coffee purchases are hardly worthy of being transmitted globally and preserved forever in a global consensus mechanism.

IMHO it *is* weirder, since it's deliberate "language engineering". Just because the English language has historically used the pronoun "he" both for known-male persons and persons of unknown gender, it doesn't mean it's the same word. The two words are just spelled the same.
German shows the problem with assuming that "he" is necessarily used to "default the gender of a person" to masculine; what's actually being defaulted is the gender of a *word*, not a person. In German, the above *problematic* sentence would be, "**Der Dieb** wurde sogar für ... bezahlt, **er** mischte 1.1861662 btc". "Der Dieb" is a masculine word, regardless of the gender of the person it refers to, and so it takes the masculine pronoun "er". This is not sexism; it's just language with rather arbitrary gender categories. That it's called "gender" at all is rather misleading and today just leads to stupid arguments over misunderstood linguistic phenomena.

It isn't about the "clever trick". It's about using state apparatus to prevent others from competing. And also about the "clever trick" being incompatible with an *entire category* of protocol upgrades (not just segwit).
This isn't just a matter of figuring out that the last 3 rounds of SHA256 needn't be completed. Such an optimization doesn't interfere with protocol upgrades, and also nobody's preventing (with state power) anybody from using that trick.

Non sequitur.


Compared to argument by assertion as you're doing here, almost any other argument is "substantiated".
A decentralized system is inherently less efficient than a centralized one, since it is the generalization of a centralized system itself. Everything a decentralized system can do is either cheaper to do in a centralized system (because it has to do less), or is impossible (because it isn't decentralized). Being more expensive is the price we have to pay to get the capabilities that no centralized system can match.


There are no other Bitcoin users.
Anyway, *why* do you believe that? Do you realize that your opinion expects *someone else* to *pay for you* the cost of processing *your transactions*? I don't want to pay for your transactions. Why should I? Why are we even doing this cryptocurrency thing if I don't get to decide whether to pay for someone else's use of the system or not?

Not much technical detail here, but do you see how difficult it's proving to get segwit activated, and that's just a softfork, which requires only a *tiny* subset of the Bitcoin system (miners) to converge to a decision?

And that doesn't change for Lightning networks' transactions. Opening and closing transactions go on the blockchain just like all your coffee purchases.
But we need to go back a step: **why** do transactions need to be verified by all? Not because of some inherent need for everyone to know everyone's business (although the creepy blockchain analysis companies are keen to do this), but because that's necessary to ensure that, when you receive some coins, they are valid. When (micro-ish)transactions "go dark" behind the veil of Lightning networks, nobody is harmed: *all* the parties whom those in-channel transactions affect can see and verify them. But nobody else needs to see those transactions, because they're affected only by the channel-opening and closing transactions.

Maybe a plausible analogy: a future in perhaps 20 years, where basically all cars are self-driving cars, and almost nobody owns their own car. One company has a stock of 100 cars, so it rents those out for the day, but it knows that 90% of the time the people renting the car don't need it - in today's world the car spends 90% of its time parked. So the rental company decides to assign 90% of its cars that it knows are currently not being used (81% of its total), to their active pool. So it rents those 81 cars out again. But again, the people ordering them only use them for 10% of the time, so 64 of its cars go right back into the pool (leaving a 10% buffer for random fluctuations in car demand). Go round a bit and the company rents out 500 cars for the day, while only really having 100.
Is it fraud? I don't know. I think it would depend on the particulars of the rental contract. Are they renting you a *car* or are they providing a *transportation service*? Back to money: are banks lending you *dollars* or are they *providing finance*?

This is no longer possible. As I'm writing this, we're 293 blocks into a difficulty adjustment window and we've had more than 100 blocks not signaling for segwit.

@_date: 2017-05-31 05:11:19


This is the tell for me that they're not being honest about their motivations.
*Why do they care how many standard transactions can fit in a block?* How does it affect them? We have every reason to believe that the majority of the network is ready to take advantage of "non-standard" (read: segwit) transactions, thereby either freeing up space for more non-SW transactions in blocks, or simply containing many more transactions in total.
It's like going to a car lot with the publicly stated goal of wanting to buy a car, but when you get to negotiating with the salesman, insisting that there be two engines under the hood, for "twice as much power" when the very same make of car comes in an option with a much bigger, more powerful engine.
It's a layer violation. They're making a demand that's at the wrong level to be a genuine need they have. A genuine need would have a form like, "We want to be able to put X inputs and Y outputs into each block". How X and Y are manifested should be of no concern to a miner negotiating in good faith.

Really? Is that how you think this works? If 100% of miners meet and decide that they're really like 12.5 btc emission per block forever, would you just go, "meh, all full nodes need to update to follow the longest chain, who cares if that chain is valid"?

Besides, Bitcoin Core and BTC1 do not implement the same consensus rules, so having both project doesn't add to *Bitcoin's* devepment diversity. Consensus-compatible (at least by intent) implementations like btcd and bcoin do. They don't deliberately cause consensus divergence.


Again, there is no "Core" in an organizational form that can bind any members of this loose association of individuals.

While inaction is an "action", you can't truthfully assert that it is symmetrical with "taking action". It's an "action" only at a different level - it's a meta-action.
Hardforking Bitcoin to emit 12.5 bitcoins per block in perpetuity as an "action" is not on the same footing as continuing to run 0.14.1 forever ("inaction"). It's very fundamentally different. You could honestly argue the *values* of the "action" option vs the "inaction" option, but not that they are "the same", "every story has two sides", etc.

BIP91 can commit segwit to being activated among nodes that implement BIP91, but BIP91 is not binding on vanilla-Core nodes. Vanilla Core nodes care only about whether 1916 of 2016 blocks in a difficulty adjustment window are signaling on bit 1 of the block version.
BIP148 does *not* implement BIP91, so we're now committed to the code path in BIP148 nodes that checks whether bit 1 is on. The leg of the code path that checks whether segwit is either activated or locked in will fail at the beginning of August: segwit will be neither activated nor locked in at that point.


"Intention signaling" is irrelevant.


Nope. BIP141 works on 2016-block windows, and we've just started one that will likely end just before 1 August, and it's already ruined for segwit activation as we've had more than 100 blocks failing to signal bit 1 of the block version. BIP141 is the consensus rule update that to my knowledge the vast majority of nodes are ready for. That same vast majority of nodes *does not implement BIP91*. (Hypothetically that could change, but I find it quite unlikely. I don't see Bitcoin Core merging any PRs implementing it, and I don't see that same majority switching to a far-alternate Bitcoin implementation. I think it's more likely they'll switch to implementing BIP148 at this point.)


Yes; I hope I've explained it adequately? If you still think you disagree, please follow up, because it would mean you misunderstand something.


It will happen. What may be averted is a *chain split*. BIP91, if it happens, will cause miner behaviour that satisfies BIP148, which will avoid a chain split. But that isn't the same as "BIP148 not happening".

Yes, and that's why I'm *in principle* opposed to such a hardfork. It sets up a slippery slope of temporary, expedient "solutions" that will undermine the social contract of bitcoin, one assumption at a time.
I'm of the opinion that *if* we do hardforks (and I much prefer the approach of coalescing around a successor coin that doesn't share ledger history), they should be big, fat hardforks that pack in as many uncontroversial HF-requiring changes as possible. The fewer hardforks a cryptocurrency goes through, the more I can trust it.


No, actually I don't see it as a mechanism that can directly support any significantly large population's casual transaction needs. Buying coffee directly on-chain was always a temporary privilege as far as I was concerned (still am). You should take Greg Maxwell's reminders that Bitcoin is maybe the "most inefficient storage system ever devised by man" seriously. It really isn't a good match for casual transacting at all. I shouldn't even need to appeal to block size issues to make that case: having to wait 10 minutes before you can begin to think of walking away with your coffee is a complete non-starter. And if you want to say, "but 0-conf!" then I'll remind you that 0-conf transactions are *by definition* not directly on-chain transactions, so it isn't much of a leap to say that a better place to put those transactions is in, say, a Lightning-esque payment channel.

I see Bitcoin's built-in payment network like a "payment system of last resort" (by analogy with a central bank as a lender of last resort). It's what "backs" Bitcoin as a currency people can use - its value. But that doesn't mean it's the payment system we (the bulk of our transaction volume anyway) necessarily need to, or should use. But it acts as an anchor to how shitty (slow, expensive, unreliable) alternative payment systems using bitcoin (small b) can possibly be.
In the beginning the "payment system of last resort" was the only one we had, so we used that. But as a small-blocker I believe we need a (!) block size limit in order to allow better payment systems (lower latency, cheaper, more anonymous?) to evolve.


Yes, I agree 100%. This thing is going nowhere if all it is is an object of hodlers' fantasies. (Maybe I should put my money where my mouth is and order something online with my satoshis, even if it's more expensive than going to the shop and paying with government fiat money.)


This is something I nearly never see addressed by big-blockers: that the core protocol *can't* work for coffee purchases. Nobody's got time for waiting 10 minutes before you can get your coffee. We *can't* do everything on-chain anyway, so let's not use "everything on-chain" as an ideal. And if you counter zero-confirmation transactions: using those as valid payments *is* an off-chain solution - those transactions are *by definition* not on the blockchain.

"Gotcha!", you must be thinking. But no, the context is about choosing between conflicting sets of transactions, an upgrade in usefulness from the immediately preceding treatment of distributed timestamping:


If one only looked at the words in isolation, one would see "majority decision making" and assume that this contemplates deciding on protocol changes. But I don't think that framing is valid here: Satoshi seems to be building up his exposition one step at a time, and the political process of making protocol changes is wayyyy downstream from distributed timestamping and transaction ordering.

No, if the BIP148 chain has &lt;50% miner support, it will be split from the non-BIP148 chain... for as long as the cumulative &lt;50% condition holds. If more cumulative work is *ever* (not just before November 15) done on the BIP148 chain than on the non-BIP148 chain, the non-BIP148 chain will reorg into the BIP148 chain, resolving the chain split.
I was also just pointing out that, even with minority miner support, the BIP148 chain won't be slow forever. It'll be slow only until its difficulty gets readjusted (every 2016 blocks - which is *not* 2 weeks under the conditions we're supposing here).

Items priced in USD might have a "stickier" USD price than that denominated in some other currency, but ultimately the price is determined by what people are willing to pay for it. And whether the item is available at all at that price is determined by the manufacturer's costs, which are denominated largely in whatever the local workforce gets paid in.

Exactly: they aren't. There's some force at work here that's stronger than the network effects that I guess are supposed to irresistibly converge on just a single currency.
I don't see why, for example, geographically-bound altcoins couldn't coexist with Bitcoin. National regions have largely closed economies: the vast majority of trade happens *within* them, not *between* them. That's one of the reasons we aren't all using US dollars as the network effect fundamentalists would have you believe. Besides, not all governments *force* you to use their national currencies other than for paying taxes.

At face value, this is exactly true, but I can't help feeling like that isn't the whole story. +1 for making me think about what more of the whole story is - it'll invariably involve things like social capital, "goodwill", etc. But yet, your statement remains true. In a legalistic sense our "obligations" toward miners have been discharged.
It reminds me of the saying about free markets: You have the right to *pursue* profit. You *don't* have the right to actually make profit though.

If the UASF happens and it isn't off to a strong start (long block intervals due to low hash rate), we'll need all the mining power we can muster then to get to the next difficulty readjustment. So if anything, you should be switching *off* your miners now (until 1 August) if you believe that a BIP148 UASF is likely to happen, that it will be unlikely to have most of the total hash rate behind it, and you want it to succeed. Keep the network difficulty low!

Good day,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,and I hope this letter meets you in good time.
It will be surprising for you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,which I, propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.
A) It is practically impossible for me to carry out this business alone.
B) You live in a foreign land far away from mine.
This should normally not be a requirement, but when you understand the transaction then you will understand why it is important that you live far away from me.
C) The amount of money involved in this transaction is One Million bitcoin (XBT1,000,000.00) which is too much for a man of modest means like myself to handle in my country.
I believe from my few points above, you can begin to get an idea why I need your participation.I am writing you in respect of a foreign customer who has a Domicillary account in my bank.
His name was Satoshi Nakamoto. He was among those who died in a plane crash, Since the demise of this our customer, Satoshi Nakamoto,who was an oil merchant and import/exporter, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then nobody has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer.
He had only One Million bitcoin(XBT1,000,000.00) in his account and the account is coded.
It is only an insider that could produce the code of the deposit particulars.
As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank.
Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin,I hereby ask for you to send an application to the bank as he next of kin to the deceased and get this fund transfered into your foreign bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you,%5 for charity, 5% for expences we will incure just in case, 35% for you and 55% for me.
All I need is for you to follow my instructions closely because I am experienced in inheritance matters here and i am on ground here to advice you on every step until you receive the money.
What is required of you is to send an application to the bank as next of kin to the late Engineer and I promise you that everything will go smoothly.
I also indulge you not to make undo use of the information given to you, I need also to trust that you will not tell people or your bank about this business.
You will collect the money first, then I get my share, then you can tell anybody what you chose thereafter.I shall need your help to invest in your country therefore, any experience you have in this area will be beneficial.
Please feel free to call me on my direct telephone number for any question or further explanations if required and upon the receipt of your favourable responses I shall send to you a text of application which you shall send to the Bank putting claim over the deceased fund.
Yours truly,
~~Mr~~Dr Craig Wright

Again, you're elevating the means (public ledger) to an ends. The *purpose* of the ledger being transparent is security - being able to prevent use of counterfeit coins. Transactions "going dark" behind Lightning networks doesn't obstruct this.

If you don't trust someone, don't transact with them and don't open channels with them. Besides, even if you opened a channel with Frank Abagnale himself, he couldn't steal your coins out of the channel without doing something out-of-band like convincing you to sign a transaction that gives him all your money.


OMG, so centralized, you can literally open channels with anyone you can convince to let you. And then you can literally do that with as many people as you like, and be the "centralized hub" you're so afraid of. And anybody else can, too.

To me, if (!) that devaluation is even and predictable (and as a result fair), that's a feature, not a bug.
It's a feature because putting dollar notes under the mattress has a dulling effect on the economy: those dollars represent social capital that isn't being used. Social capital should be used as much as possible! That's how an economy grows. Letting those dollars devalue is an effective incentive for people to invest that social capital (in the form of money) in the economy where it can generate more capital.
Besides, I see no a priori moral reason why you should be able to enjoy the time value of money at no cost. If I'm a baker and I give you (a butcher) a loaf of bread in exchange for a chunk of meat, that exchange of value is settled then and there. If instead I give you the loaf of bread in exchange for 100 Bak (my made-up currency), I can either buy your chunk of meat right then and there, or do that next month. The fact that I have the *option* has real value, and that value comes from the fact that you (the butcher) are willing to honour my currency. I see no reason why you should *not* benefit from this value you provide to our micro-society.
Where it becomes unfair is if I take advantage of the information asymmetry in how many Bak there are in circulation. Let's say it's Feast in our village, and I want a whole bunch of stuff. So I go into my basement and strike 10000 Bak, and then go on a spending spree, but importantly without having told any of my trading partners of the previous months (who now hold Bak) of my intention to do this. It's unfair because I'm not holding my end of an implied bargain: that the tokens I issue will be limited in some way, and that I won't just arbitrarily make more of them as I want more stuff.
A cryptocurrency with infinite emission also "devalues", but it isn't unfair because everyone knows what the issuance schedule is.
TL;DR: Information asymmetry is the real bogeyman, not devaluation of savings.

No, segwit can no longer enter the LOCKED_IN state before BIP148's signaling-enforcement window starts. The last 2016-block window that falls entirely before 1 August started this last Friday, and we've already had more than the maximum of 100 non-SW-signaling blocks that ruin this window for the possibility of entering the LOCKED_IN state before BIP148's logic starts.

No, this is an easy mistake to slip into. There are diminishing returns to the utility of a network as a function of its transaction-clearing capacity. Doubling the block size will double the cost of running a node, but it will *less than double* the utility of the network. Think about it this way: currently there are transactions excluded from the blockchain because the utility of clearing them is less than the fees required to outbid some other transactions. If you increase the average block size to a point where those transactions get cleared, the **average utility** of the transactions that do get cleared **drops**. That's sub-linear scaling, and is a bad way to do it. Building out a layer stack, on the other hand, exhibits super-linear scaling, which is a good way to do it. (It produces "network effects" instead of consuming them like a simple block size increase would.)
Remember also that the number of transactions you get in a network doesn't necessarily scale linearly in the number of users. It might be closer to scaling with the square of the number of users (but realistically, human networks aren't 100% dense, so it isn't pure n^2 ). Doubling the block size might turn out to increase the number of users the currency supports by only 1.4.

I don't believe it. I believe with some confidence that we *won't* see $500k in 3 years. At $500k, bitcoin will still be a pipsqueak currency in the global economy, so prices will still be mostly denominated in government-fiat currencies. That includes electricity. $500k bitcoin would require some tradeoff between 500GW dedicated to mining vs. much higher electricity prices than now. I don't think we can bring another **50% of global electricity production** online within the next 3 years, so bitcoin mining will be competing for the "same electricity" (nitpick: it's fungible) as the rest of the economy, driving prices up while also displacing other uses of electricity. Both of these effects would slow down the economy. I don't think a serious economic contraction is compatible with $500k bitcoin.
To answer the objection that bitcoin mining is part of the economy: yes, that's true, but I don't think it's a very productive sector. By design, all that work done by miners is "useless". There's no loaf of bread you can eat or manufactured item you can use to improve total utility.
Another objection: if another halvening happens, then the numbers shift to 250GW / 25% of total. I still don't quite see that happening, although it's much more plausible than fully half of global electricity production.

Multiple implementations of *the same protocol* are fine, these do not harm a consensus system. But not all project forks remain consensus-compatible, and these *harm* the consensus system.
Bitcoin Core (more accurately, Wladimir van der Laan) have "power" only in that they form a Schelling point around which the rest of us coalesce. Nobody is bound to use only the code they write and (as Wladimir does) release. If they fuck up the social trust (which is not formal, and not part of the consensus system they implement) the user community will revolt and coalesce around a new Schelling point.

The problem is that you'd need as many currencies as things you want to buy, if you want the price of each to be stable. People's preferences for things change - they're each kinda like "currencies" free-floating against each other. This year, your rent is 100 cell phone months; maybe in five years with more mobile network buildout, your rent would be 200 cell phone months.
You have to evaluate inflation against a basket of goods, and that's an inherently averaging process, and unless everyone is exactly average, everyone will actually experience a slightly different inflation rate. Even if you applied monetary policy in a tight feedback loop where the average (over all consumers) basket's price is the same over years, *some* people will experience rising prices (as oil gets harder to get at, information easier) because they use more oil than average, and others will experience declining prices because they use more information than average.

It takes an expert (well I wouldn't put it that strongly, but you need some level of understanding) to notice a looming catastrophe before it's too late to avert it.


Really, this self-unaware ignorance is what Cryptolution was referring to. Asicboost is not merely a technology upgrade, a difference in degree. It's a difference in kind: it undermines the requirement for the PoW function to be *progress-free*.
But worse than that is the layer-violating property of especially covert Asicboost. It gives miners an economic reason to care about the [language]( that the block data has to conform to, beyond the codified consensus rules. (Covert) Asicboost in essence gives miners an incentive to run an *undeclared softfork* - certain arrangements of transactions (and transaction data, as in the case of coinbase commitments as in segwit or *any other protocol change using that mechanism*) in the blocks they seek to mine become crypto-*invalid*, not just a matter of local *policy*. If it were just "we don't mine any RBF tx", that's just a policy applied at the *block contents layer*. But Asicboost applies constraints that originate in one layer (needing merkle root hashes to give partial collisions) to data in another layer (the block data).

Git is not a distributed consensus protocol, so there's no need for "longest chain wins", or any "winning" at all, for that matter. All that matters to git is that one can reliably retrieve a particular version of the data it stores. It's a content-addressable filesystem, not a consensus protocol. But there's nothing stopping you from layering a consensus protocol on top of git (usually through human-level interaction) and use something like "longest chain of mental work wins" or maybe "signed by the BDFL wins", if you care about \~everyone running the *same* version. But most of the time in git-managed software, we don't care about running the *same* version as everyone else, only about running a *compatible* version. In Bitcoin, by contrast, there's no such thing as a "compatible" blockchain that isn't the same as or strict subset of another - the no-double-spending rule demands that.

I was simulating a carry-save adder type of wide adder to see after how many stages on average of adding the carries back into the next most significant bits it produced the correct result. For 100% correctness you need as many stages as there are bits, effectively not much different to a ripple adder. But if you don't need 100% correctness, you can get away with completing maybe half the number of stages for full correctness.
[I made a run of ~10000 simulated additions of bash's $RANDOM (gives 0..32767) and collected them into bins of the number of stages needed to get a correct result.]( (Note that this run probed a space of two 15-bit numbers, not the full 32-bit space needed for SHA256.)

No, the purpose of patents is "to advance the useful arts". Its purpose is not to let everyone work on a concept from date of publication of the patent. The implied social contract is not to grant a limited monopoly in exchange for immediate access to the patented thing, it's to grant that limited monopoly in exchange for that thing being available in the public domain *when the patent expires*.
Internal use is not privileged, it is still subject to licencing. It's just potentially difficult to detect (and hence difficult to enforce the patent), and in addition you have to prove *damages*, which may be hard to come up with if the use is only internal.
And no, the patent holder is not entitled to the *revenue* from a product; they're entitled to *damages*. (There are also statutory damages, but AFAIK usually that's a less prominent issue.)
There's nothing that entitles anyone to make an Asicboosted mining chip without a licence from Timo &amp; Sergio (or presumably from Jihan if in China). Even if such a chip is neither being sold nor used for revenue-generating mining and is only used, for example, to study power consumption of mining (on testnet maybe).

I can't even figure out what you mean. What is "any server-side interaction"?
Think of this example then:
You go to a site, but it sees you haven't paid yet, and responds:
    HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
    Content-Type: application/bitcoin-paymentrequest
    
    ... BIP70 stuff here ...
No new client-side behaviour needed beyond installing a MIME type handler for application/bitcoin-paymentrequest - any 4xx response is an error as far as the browser is concerned.
Now imagine this MIME type handler being built into the browser, with a policy like "automatically pay sites in the whitelist if the amount is less than 5000 satoshi". So the browser would see the payment request, automatically submit a payment, and then retry the HTTP request. Until browsers do this automatically, you can just simulate it by letting the browser start up your wallet software to handle the payment request, and once that's done you manually hit refresh.
401 vs 402 vs 404 vs 500 has *nothing* to do with displaying stuff to the user and *everything* to do with communicating meaning to a program (your browser). If you're just going to display some text asking for payment, you might as well just return HTTP 200 OK and call it a day, and if anyone wants to automate that stuff they'll just have to screenscrape.

Yes, I'm refuting it. It's only *conditionally* true that bitcoin received after a fork will be spendable only on one fork. The condition under which coins are spendable only on one side of the fork is when the ancestry of those coins includes coinbase outputs mined in a post-fork block. (BTW remember that all coins' ultimate ancestry consists purely of coinbase outputs.) If your coin doesn't include post-fork coinbase outputs, then you can spend that coin on any side of the fork. To do so you may have to broadcast some parent transactions first.
TL;DR: If Satoshi himself sends you some of his early coins after the fork without "infecting" them with post-fork coinbase outputs, you can spend those coins.

But you can replay that transaction to the other side of the fork too.

The problem is that just because there's work that needs doing, there's no guarantee that a human can do that work cost-effectively. It might cost a human more to get to work than the wages they could earn by doing it.
Especially if the coming robot revolution is as bad for human employment as the doomsayers say.


I don't think the idea is that the millions of currently employed would form the main body of the creative genius population. It would be those (that are far larger in number) who currently hold down ordinary jobs, who can't afford to take the risk of starting a business or follow their creative muse, because they know that failure would mean destitution.
If more people could afford to take such risks (because they knew that if they failed, they wouldn't fall *too far*, being caught by the social safety net), presumably more people would take them, and as a result more of those risks' rewards would materialize.
Not an exact comparison, but think of the medieval renaissance. Many of the technological advances were made on a stipend, a noble's grant to an inventor / scientist / philosopher that allowed them to think or to build, which creates social value but is sometimes difficult to monetize directly into a wage. A UBI would be giving everyone such a stipend.
I haven't even touched on what being able to quit an abusive or unreasonably dangerous job would do to the labour market, and to injury rates.

That's a completely different kind of claim. It isn't a factual claim, specifically.

The truth of whether they're "pushing their patents in" is not subject to your "personal assessment of the situation". It isn't a subjective experience you're claiming there, it's an objective fact (which is false) you're claiming. They aren't "pushing their patents in" in any way that grants them the ability to "take over". The Asicboost crew on the other hand? Yeah, they're doing that. Until they grant a public licence to their patent(s), their respective patents grant them the ability to "take over" (and in Bitmain's case, it appears that that's exactly what they're in the process of doing, or at least trying to do - taking over).

(Also having to stretch to follow this logic. But it's a flawed analogy for BIP148.

The split is proximally caused by the first miner to mine a non-segwit-signaling block after 1 August.)

What makes a Lightning node valuable (leading to profit, leading to being a large node) is having good connections to other nodes. That largely means having many connections.

If 85% were signaling bit 1, BIP148 would be a lot less scary. Instead of having to bite your nails as you ignore currently about two thirds of all blocks, you would then have to only ignore an occasional non-signaling block. It would also be a LOT less scary for those bit 1-signaling miners to enforce BIP148 also, since they wouldn't need to be nearly as worried about losing a race to even an earlier non-signaling block.

No, the entire connected network of channels is available. Kinda like all internet users can communicate, despite almost all of them having only a single "channel" for IP packets connecting them to the network.


Open channels wisely and you may need to open and close channels only very rarely. Like a few times per lifetime maybe.
Or do you close your bank account after each purchase?

I think it's very possible. It might not be the very next thing that's attempted, but this "compromise" would (or already does, I haven't figured this out yet) set up a slippery slope that makes subsequent changes easier. The general pattern is, "We should hardfork out &lt;consensus rule&gt; because &lt;expedient reasons&gt;". Maybe the next &lt;consensus rule&gt; is block time, and the corresponding &lt;expedient reason&gt; something about waiting for confirmations while buying coffee. Then mining difficulty because ecological conscionability, and then coin issuance doesn't look so impossible to me anymore.
No, the best (and possibly only) place to stop this shit is right at the start of the slippery slope, where a hardfork is proposed when that isn't existentially necessary.
(Note: Slippery slope arguments are not fallacious when there is a proposed mechanism by which each step makes subsequent steps easier.)


Call me a conspiracy theory nutjob if you like, but I suspect it could be more than just that. And even if not, if it is really just egos, it's functionally equivalent to a proof-of-concept social exploit against cryptocurrencies. If any state actors or similar are interesting, they now have a demonstration of how to fight this dragon.


Well I (and I don't think I'm alone) think that accepting this sort of "compromise" that's negotiated following the same macro as the 2008 bank bailouts (and I'd like to remind you of the not too cryptic message in the genesis block) already destroys bitcoin's value proposition. So I'm somewhat leaning towards "We're already screwed, no matter what happens" (but not completely, as I'm not *sure* if I agree that a coin split would "destroy" Bitcoin's value proposition).


You could choose to smply not run a reference implementation of any coin that's maintained by a set of developers you don't trust.


I strongly suspect we'd be arguing about when to "upgrade" it to SegWit4x. The goalposts would keep shifting. This sort of "appeasement" strategy doesn't work when you're dealing with a hostile adversary, which I think we are dealing with. In that case, appeasement merely emboldens them. By accepting SegWit2x we'd have reframed the debate, moved the Overton Window to a place where the next subversion seems less unreasonable.


Can you tell that I'm pessimistic? I don't think that will happen. "Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter", where Bitcoin is the shepherd and Litecoin is one of the sheep. State actors or similarly powerful adversaries [may] have succeeded in subverting a system whose goal appears to have been to reject their influence; if they can successfully subvert Bitcoin like in a final boss battle in a game, then the game is over, it's no fun and it isn't necessary to go back to level 1 to defeat another minnow. It won't just be *Btcoin* that will be dead (read: its value proposition undermined), but *the entire category* that it falls into (something like: hashcash-based cryptocurrencies). I don't think we'll get a do-over here unless we can find the next level of cypherpunk power somehow. (Hint: Turing-complete blockchains are not it.)

In at least one sense, no, maybe we shouldn't give them that choice. I don't think Satoshi anticipated that mining would coalesce into pools, essentially outsourcing proof of work from block validation, and block validation from proof of work. But Satoshi's vision shmision, we don't need to appeal to authority. It seems pretty clear to me that the current topology of the Bitcoin ecosystem has a fundamental flaw, and there are no obvious solutions. Mining has become, and may inevitably always be, centralized. Not in the geographical sense, although that too, but it isn't as important. But organizationally - where a single entity, even just a person, or very few, are able to dominate the ecosystem to the point that they can "impose" Frankensteinian "compromises" on us with the might of their hardware. Hardware that pays for its own expansion - a vicious circle.
So yes, the somewhat authoritarian idea to "not give them a choice" may be an approximation of a correction to this distortion. I haven't figured out yet if this cure is worse than the disease.

Yes, they should show themselves early, but then (and maybe only if it looks like BIP148 will have a wobbly start) decline to mine some 2 weeks before D Day.
Doing this will also remove information from the ecosystem about how much support BIP148 really has, making it all a little bit more scary (and there are arguments that BIP148-coin would differentially benefit from such scariness).

So chain forks are good, right? Each fork is its own chain, each no more or less valid than the other.
Actually, two blockchains are **worse** than one, which is why we work so hard to avoid forks. An altchain needs to be offer *significant* benefits over the most popular one in order for its mere existence to not be a net burden on society. Currency is *the* textbook example for network effects. I'd go so far as to say that a currency is *nothing but* network effects.

In my view it just means that if you "know nothing about coding" then you should just recuse yourself from thinking your opinion on technical matters is valid and leave it to people who are fluent in the technology.

Glib answer: time preference of money.
It's better to have an amount of money now than the same nominal amount in a year, so today's money is objectively worth more, even if prices of goods and services didn't increase. But next year's money is worth less that today's for everyone else too, not just for you, so prices increase to reflect that. Your next-year money doesn't go as far, because it just isn't worth as much, because it isn't available now.
Let's say we're in the mythical barter economy. I'm a butcher, and you're a baker. You want a chunk of meat, and I want a loaf of bread. Great, we have a [coincidence of wants]( so we can trade. But let's say you want a chunk of meat now, but I still have bread. We can still trade, if you agree to honour the credit I give you now for the chunk of meat, by giving me a loaf of bread at any time in the future. That flexibility itself has value: having the "right" to a loaf of bread *at any time in the future*. Is it self-evident that this surplus (the flexibility of the transaction) should be free to me? It isn't self-evident to me. In some sense I feel I should have to "pay" for the privilege somehow. And in an economy with gradually (but predictably) rising prices, I pay for it by knowing that I'll pay slightly more (nominally anyway) for that loaf the longer I postpone the purchase. It's possible to arrange the parameters so that everyone is better off, compared to the mythical barter economy. You still get your chunk of meat now, so you're not worse off. I still get my loaf of bread, but at a time when it's convenient to me, so I'm better off. If I trade some (not all!) of that benefit of the flexibility for a little bit more consideration from my side (maybe I bring a bone for your dog when I collect my bread) then I'm still nett better off, and so are you.
I think that's why we accept that our money slowly "disappears". If this rate of disappearance is gradual and equally predictable to everyone, then I don't see any a priori injustice here.

This gets into weird philosophical issues, but I don't think "followed by a hard fork" is a good description. The re-expansion of rules for blocks after November 15 is to rules no wider than they are now. So I don't think it's fair to call that a "hard fork", because it isn't two separate rules, one tightening, and the other loosening requirements, but one combined rule that tightens the requirements for blocks *only during the August-November interval*.


This is false. Block headers record a timestamp, and if that timestamp falls between 1 August and 15 November, that block has to signal for segwit. Non-segwit blocks with a timestamp in that interval don't magically become valid to BIP148 nodes just because your computer's clock says it's 20 November today.
The reorganization risk is asymmetric: only the non-BIP148 chain is subject to reorganizing into the BIP148 chain; the BIP148 chain will be permanent. The only way to reogranize "the" BIP148 chain is to mine a longer chain that is *also a BIP148 chain*.

The mined coin exist only by consensus of the miners and users. A block mined now whose coinbase transaction is "give 500 bitcoin to X" is simply not valid, because the network consensus only allows for 25 right now. In order to get that 500-coin block award accepted, you'd have to get the vast majority of users (not just 51%) to use a Bitcoin implementation that recognized them as valid. What incentive is there to "upgrade" to this sort of inflation?


No: the Federal Reserve isn't really accountable to you as an ordinary bitcoin user. Gavin Andresen and his merry band of miners are a lot more accountable to you: they don't have laws quasi-forcing you to use Bitcoin, they have only your consent. If they do something you (and yes, a single person wouldn't matter, but assume there'd be many people like you) don't approve of, you'd no longer consent - you'd stick to the non-inflationary Bitcoin, or switch to an altcoin.
Remember that Bitcoin is growing *entirely* because people are voluntarily choosing to use it. There are no men with guns forcing you to use it to pay, for example, your taxes.


It would be the wealthy whom this would hurt most. Why would they devalue that which they have a lot of, and in the case of miners, have invested in? They have a *huge* stake in the value of bitcoin; if anything, their incentive is to lobby to *reduce* the final total number of bitcoin.

That's a reason for them to make rational choices. It is not a reason for granting them more political privilege.
Remember that their interests are not as perfectly aligned with the welfare of the broader Bitcoin network as you seem to think. Their hardware doesn't last too long before it's obsolete, so discount that from how "invested" they are. That leaves electricity, rent, and maintenance, which are just operational expenses, not capital.
Miners face incentives that are a bit like a publicly-listed company's board faces: make next quarter's profits look good, the long term health of the company be damned. Remember that Bitcoin's difficulty readjustments nudge miners' economic profit to zero, such that almost all their mining rewards are eaten up by expenses. That doesn't leave them all *that* invested in the future price of Bitcoin. Add to that that mining hardware, once bought, is largely a [sunk cost](

Please define what you mean by "cheating" their way to wealth.
I don't think getting lucky by getting into the right industry at the right time should count as "cheating". Nor should having had rich parents be considered "cheating".
To me, "cheating" implies a breaking of rules - actual rules, not just imagined rules that those on the losing end of the bargain feel that those on the winning end should honour.
Do you think taking maximum advantage of tax codes in order to pay the least amount possible, is "cheating"? I don't. I don't see why anyone should be held to a higher standard than what tax laws require. If you think the tax laws require too little, then change the law!
It's really difficult to even grapple with your question without knowing your definition of "cheating" and "actually earn".

95% is a bit arbitrary though, don't you think? Un-arbitrary thresholds would be, say, 33%, or 50%, or 67%, or (unrealistically) 100%. I don't see any prima facie reason why any miner action with more than 50% support (among miners) is *necessarily an attack*. Whether something is an attack shouldn't be judged without context, IMO. If it were the case that only 6% of hash power were resisting segwit, for example, that 6% would be what I consider an "attack", and everyone else ganging up on them would be "defence". But your definitional mileage may vary, I guess.
95% signaling is not itself a consensus rule for protocol changes in general. It's just what happens to be the value of one of the parameters for BIP9-style softforks. Sure, it's part of the (new) consensus rules for *particular* protocol changes, but it's just an arbitrary number until it gets instantiated into a new particular protocol change. There's no consensus rule that specifies that a future softfork needs to be signaled to 95% (before that softfork is defined).

While it would act as a brake on a growing economy, it would (maybe?) act as a fuel for a contracting one (same amount of money chasing a dwindling amound of goods and services -&gt; prices go up, value of money goes down, people have an incentive to spend sooner). I wonder if Bitcoin's greatest virtue will turn out to be its stabilizing property?

So here's what you do: use a distro from 1999 or so on a computer from the same era that you pull out of someone's attic. It would have to be a long game for the NSA to have played. There may be vulnerabilities in that setup, but they'll be *old* ones, and they'll quite likely predate the NSA anticipating anything like bitcoin.
Sure, you'd probably have to do a bit of porting to get the 2013-era bitcoin code to compile and run on a 1999-era operating system, but it'll be less effort than (re-re-re-re-re-re-re-)auditing your distro.

If that hope of a better tomorrow is no longer credible, you can expect some turmoil.

Won't they lose their edge?
Once they get their 2-block lead, they publish one block, keeping another in reserve while they mine on top of the reserve block. So in this state, on average they'll have one reserve block and be "halfway" (at least 10 minutes - since they're &lt;50%) to finding another block on top of the reserve block. But in the remaining "half" the rest of the network isn't just sitting still; if the evil pool is 33%, then the honest network can, on average, find a block in the time that the evil pool gets "halfway". So, about half the time that the evil pool has reached this state where they have one block in reserve, another miner finds a block that competes with the reserve block, forcing the evil pool to publish their reserve block, just as they are "about to" find their second private block.
Doesn't it just end up in the evil pool's blocks being orphaned 50% of the time, in effect making them work twice as hard as everyone else to find blocks?

I remember around 2013 Bitpay had some numbers that showed that as bitcoin price went up, people spent *more*, not less, which seems to contradict the narrative that "if the value of money increases, people will hold onto it rather than spending it". At some point the value of the money rises to the point where some people (who aren't a monolith!) choose to "lock in" the value of their money by buying some stuff. They know that the value of their money has some volatility, and that it may go down again.

While simultaneously not breaking the bank. Miners seem to be priced at a point that their marginal value is zero: once you adjust for the risk involved, the (fiat) money you pay to get your miner is about as much as your miner will ever economically produce.
But if, as you repeatedly insist, you don't care about economic constraints, then nothing stops you from CPU / GPU mining right now, while you wait for your mega super duper ASIC miner to arrive.
Personally I want to mine because it's fun, and it supports the bitcoin network when random people do it without being captive to a specific mining pool. (It'd help even more to solo mine, but the budget for that is just too unthinkable for my circumstances and risk tolerance to even be tempted.) I recently decided not to mine after all, when it became clear to me that I wouldn't be able to get PCBs manufactured and components shipped before January, by which point the whole venture costs more to set up than it will ever return. That's how fast mining difficulty increases: in a matter of *weeks* you go from "double your money" to "barely break even".

I was referring to the scenario where the Fed bought all bitcoin, or mined it to hell, or something, to the point that it became useless to anyone. At that point, everyone who holds bitcoin is already impacted! Moving to a new chain simply reboots the public ledger and we start again. Maybe with a minor tweak to the hashing algorithm so that the Fed's miners don't just nuke the new blockchain again (but at the same time neutering honest ASIC miners).
A lot of the technical bitcoin infrastructure would survive, perhaps requiring some minor tweaks to software. Basically all of the social capital of the participants would survive. Public confidence in decentralized cryptocurrencies in general would be hurt though (until we go through the cycle a few times and if (!) the Fed eventually just gives up).

The only way out I can see is (and while hopeful, I'm not yet convinced) if there's something brilliant about the bitcoin protocol (and we've seen retroactive brilliance before - I'm sure Satoshi must be a benevolent alien) that disincentivizes the sort of exclusionary behaviours we've come to associate with too-big-to-fail organizations.

So you believe that the network should subsidize transactions? Verifying, relaying, and storing transactions isn't free to the network, although to you it may seem as good as free. But, "as good as free" is not quite the same as "free": allowing transactions to be a net cost to the network turns them into a denial-of-service vector. The fact that the blockchain is decentralized means that the bitcoin network *amplifies* the potency of an attacker. An attacker can spend 200-odd bytes on a unit of attack, but it will cost the network thousands of times that amount.
While I agree that transaction costs should be determined in a competitive market, I think they should be allowed to be high enough to cover the cost to the network of their existence. If you want to spam the blockchain under those circumstances, I'm all in favour of that, since you would be paying for what you use.


Your aside is the very problem - you can't just dismiss it like that! *Your* marginal cost of storing an extra 200-odd bytes might be zero, since your hard disk isn't full and you already have it, but we aren't dealing with just one extra transaction here. We're dealing with thousands upon thousands, and the possibility of having to buy more disks. (If you insist on calling storage "free", then does the 4 billionth transaction have a marginal cost of whatever a whole disk costs? No, I think you get saner answers if you average the cost over *all* transactions.)

Firstly, the environmental impact of mining is a drop in the ocean compared to the economic efficiencies that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is capable of wringing out of this rock.
Secondly, in a sense mining *needs* to be "wasteful", in order to be an honest signal of the work applied to securing transactions. If you prefer something like Primecoin for doing something "useful" besides finding arbitrary numbers, realize that because chains of prime numbers have value to society, there's an incentive to mine transaction at a slight loss, which you can make up by "selling" (somehow) the chains of prime numbers. By doing something "useful" outside of securing transactions, you'd end up subsidizing some other endeavour. Who chooses what we subsidize? How green is it to know so much about prime number, but not about, say, climate?

It depends on which false equivalence you want to address. If you want to address the fact that *Amazon* already has "this", you can distinguish bitcoin by calling it a *decentralized* virtual currency. Other avenues of distinguishing bitcoin: it's a *cryptographically backed* currency, or it's a *computationally validated* currency, or maybe you just want to draw attention to the fixed supply?
You're going to have to choose your battles here; you can't distinguish bitcoin from all other currencies without specifying what each of the differences are, while still using only two or three words to categorize it. You're going to have to accept that there will be other things that fit whatever category you choose to apply to bitcoin.
FWIW I don't have a problem with the word "virtual".

Some are, some aren't. Unfortunately, "facts" don't always exist in a vacuum - they exist in a context. Coin Validation isn't just making arguments, it's omitting others that are relevant, and spinning the ones it does make. It's absolutely relevant to question the motives of someone making arguments which, if we accept the arguments, benefit them.
The arguments we're getting also [don't flow only from premises that are generally accepted]( We absolutely should question what the premises are, and whether the presented conclusions follow logically from them. Drawing attention to the fact that someone has an incentive to distort the discourse is not fallacious. The argument here isn't, "Matthew Mellon is a philanderer and therefore Coin Validation is a Bad Thing (tm)", it's "Matthew Mellon is connected to an industry that has a lot to lose if Bitcoin goes mainstream; his motives are more likely to protect banks than to improve Bitcoin."

[If the channel is insecure]( they lose through no fault of their own. You can't just say "it's their own fault for not using SSL" because that's exactly what this payment protocol seeks to add, and which haven't been available until now. [I just wish they didn't go for x.509 certificates (search for "Financial Incentives")](

How are they "losing money"? The dollar is strengthening against the bitcoin, so those holding it are having a good run. For every seller, there's a buyer.
And remember, those "losing money" now are greedy too. Not so long bitcoin was under $200. Do you remember that? Blast from the past hey!

I've been wondering if Bitcoin ends up being regulators' allies, in that it's a competitor for regulatory favour that they could use to extract bigger concessions from their campaign funders. Or, equivalently, it gives them a stronger defence against the demand of the various lobby groups. The price of a politician's soul might be going up.

Being arguably the most important website on the Internet also makes them arguably the most potentially influential bitcoin-accepting organization. If WMF were to accept bitcoin, do you think their bank would dare to send them one of those "plz dnt bitcoin k?" letters?

That's only if we naively assume that the way we do transactions now will be how we do it when we do tens of thousands per second. There are other options than just scaling up the bandwidth and storage. Off-chain transactions for one, would preserve the decentralization of the blockchain, at the cost of some centralization of payment protocols.

A terrible bug that exists only because the me-too altcoins split the eyeball market and this bug ceased being shallow, perhaps.

Right now, yes, because in the current real world, the economy is dominated by currencies other than bitcoin. The stores need to pay their staff, they need to pay for their stock, they need to pay the rent, and all these are likely to be denominated in a currency other than bitcoin. If/when the bitcoin grows much larger, maybe even dominates, all these transactions will be denominated in bitcoin too, and the store's prices for the items it sells will no longer fluctuate.

And miners respond by deploying more mining hardware, until they spend almost all their mining revenue on electricity (in the long term - while we're still getting there, the cost of capital goods takes a large part of the revenue).

They'd better be ready to pay those millions over and over and over and over as we simply reset everything to a new chain as they attack each predecessor chain.

I don't see how bitcoin banking couldn't work. How about you, you and you each deposit 10BTC with me, and I'll lend that other guy 30BTC. (I'll give you some interest, and charge him some too, to make it a better offer than just holding onto it yourself.) Hey that's odd, 25BTC just got deposited into my bank after I gave that guy the 30BTC - I guess he paid his employees and they, in turn, deposited their salary. (Maybe they like the idea of interest.)
Hey, does anyone want to borrow 20BTC?
If you want "fictional banking" not to exist, you'll have to make sure that either it isn't profitable in practice (one avenue: banks might have little recourse for bad debts), or convince everyone not to deposit their bitcoin, despite offers of interest.

I don't know where you are, but here where I am (South Africa) it isn't just a dichotomy between "public space, nobody can tell you what [not] to do" and "private property, they can throw you out for being black/jewish/qrcoded". There's a third area, private property that's open to the public, where protections against unfair discrimination apply. Some years back a group of hobos (they're called "bergies" here) sued a fancypants shopping mall for not allowing them to enter, and they won, because the refusal to let them in wasn't based on their being a nuisance to other patrons etc. - it was simply classism.

What are the chances that you would be willing to buy an address from someone that started 1Kay2a... if you knew that they would know the private key and could spend any coin sent to that address, anytime they liked, if they wanted to?
