If it's being misused structurally, it's a design flaw. You don't design for an ideal world where people behave like you want them to.

I'm not clear. Do you think they're wrong? 
It's clear that you think they *should* be wrong. But it's facile to argue that the Commerce Clause doesn't so empower Congress. 
Art. I, Sec. 8, Clause 3 empowers Congress to... 


It does not place limits on how that may be accomplished, or on what scope or scale. 
So, does the Commerce Clause empower Congress to regulate interstate and international commerce? Absolutely. The conservative and libertarian thought on this is that activist judges have somehow broadened the Commerce Clause beyond the textual reading. But the clause itself is immensely broad on its face. 
Commerce Clause jurisprudence isn't some kind of liberal conspiracy. It's simply the unavoidable result when you read that passage without the preconceived notion that government activity is bad. 
Don't like it? Propose a Constitutional amendment to place restrictions on the Commerce Clause.
