because obviously current currencies are bound to regions. Cryptos are bound to the internet only which makes them all "equal"

Great job! May I ask what API's you are using to fetch the information? 
You mentioned it even helps you with currencies that not even you know so you must be hitting up some API that someone else is maintaining

Yes that is what I meant :) since setInterval accepts a function as the first parameter there is no need to wrap h.stop
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:15:17
um if h.stop is a function then thats exactly what setInterval was intended for. wrapping the funtion call in an anonymous function is absolutely not necessary

Yeah the total amount of interested people is growing no questions asked. 
Actually, as you assumed, I myself also lost focus in 2015-16. Maybe youre right with that. 
You know, you said you feel like now is the time most people are interested and youre definetly right. Every peak literally indicates peak interest because more buyers -&gt; higher price meaning whenever the price grows higher then it ever was before you can safely assume that there are currently more interested people then ever before

No Im saying that bitcoin made the mainstream news pretty often already, usually due to spikes or some story related to it. Then for a short while of course awareness is raised and you start hearing about it everywhere but that fades away again. Its not like its mainstream now. 
My other point was that if you stay tuned, you will always hear about bitcoin every now and then. (Be it on reddit or whatever other techy source)

Um it hast been like that since ~2013. Generally when you spend time with stuff you tend to be more aware of anything related to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:43:37
Can we stop with this "100%" stuff? No one knows anything so it just seems childish...

It also kind of solves the problem that both sender and receiver must be online for each transaction with lightning network. As long as youre alive youre probably online.

Youre right, except for the fact that they
* have their OS installed on easily more than half of all computers being used
* are the only liable option for pretty much all office software
* own more than 75% of enterprise software market
* are one of the top 2 competitors in the console gaming industry
* are the ONLY option for PC gaming
Seems irrelavent to me. Youre right.

Does the Lightning Network make use of segwit or is it a seperate solution?

For point one I agree, I was refering to personal computers.
Point 2 is, well, sadly, a good product is not all you need nowadays to be "relevant". I guess youre right and Im pretty sure googles stuff is probably much more convenient as well because it works in the browser and is defaultly cloud based (office 365 is as well but its, well, just not google). 
However you still wont find any schools that teach it. Microsoft has just been here longer and therefore is mostly relevant if the office space even if google has suporior software (which I really think is the case, MS Office feels clunky)

Nope, you got that wrong. So everyone is "supposed" to change their rep (which is what defines the decentralization). If ALL wallets would change their rep to ONE node that would technically make nano centralized. But since currently the protocol round robin's between trusted nodes and people DO actually change their rep, nano is becoming even more decentralized than btc (due to mining centralization). 
And the devs are working on an implementation that will round robin between infinite nodes instead of trusted. Basicly though, the current strategy has proven to work. Nano is decentralized

Actually the founders are running out of money :) Should say a lot about their incentives for developing the project.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:18:14
dude how does increasing TPS not qualify as scaling? Are you stupid? Yes nano nodes store all transactions..it doesnt matter? Bitcoins problem is in no way the ledger size... Its the TPS and fees that do not scale. You literally took the ONE thing common between nano and bitcoin WHICH SCALES in bitcoin and are banking on that. Storage is cheap to the point its not worth mentioning..
also, pruning is a thing and it works.

Too save us both some time I'l link you to this thread:

Maybe you could head over there and argue with some of us or if you like, we can continue here. But again, youre welcome there!

What the hell? Did you even read the whitepaper? 
Stop being delusional
Everything you said is wrong.. (except that bitcoin has limitations)
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:35:15
yeah......if you'd watch any interview of the foundation you'd know thats not true.

Much easier for merchants to accept paypal payments than anything else (thats not crypto).
