Yeah that is a possible explanation for this, and probably what this has evolved into with the panic.
However looking through the transaction logs, there were many, many sell orders for very low amounts of btc, around 0.02 btc. Some one/group was just sending in shitloads of orders to cause the site to lag. (note: I didn't mean they DDoS'd the site to necessarily bring it down, but cause trading lag). This has happened before (and I am getting more aggravated with Mt.Gox for not being able to cope with it). Couple this with other big exchanges going down and it seems (to me anyway) that this started as a DDoS, which caused panic, just like last week only this one is bigger.
If I'm wrong about this being a deliberate attack, I still believe the rest of my post holds, there is still trading lag, bitcoinity is still "completely behind". I wouldn't try trading in these conditions.

I wouldn't trust that to be the actual current price, mt.gox is still experiencing lag.

But you should definitely be prepared to lose 50%, you should be prepared to lose 100%. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should be happy about it, but I'm saying no one should have invested more than they were willing to lose; it's been quite clear that bitcoin is a very volatile currency.
It was a sort of reminder to myself and to people that were comfortable with their original investment and were in it for the long haul, to relax a bit and enjoy the ride.
Sorry if it came off as obnoxious

Thanks, I'll look into bitstamp.
Oh, and I'm not selling by the way, I just want to have the option to get my money when I want, and not have to deal with transferring/figuring out how to do it when the time comes.
