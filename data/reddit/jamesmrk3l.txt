This is a must read for anyone that cares about privacy in Bitcoin, thanks for sharing!

Let's disregard the concerns with transaction throughput for a second. If this proves to be accurate, this may push for better UI integration on e-commerce platforms - something that is desperately needed for mainstream adoption.

This guy obviously does not understand the tech and wants attention by saying something controversial.

Crazy how they're using the segwit "brand" to commercialize an increase in block size. Wonder if they actually believe in what they're proposing.

You're confused. Don't look at inflation in terms of price levels (like in the "real economy") - in Bitcoin, these forces only have to do with supply. And Bitcoin's supply is only deflationary because there a supply cap and, over time, a small fraction of people will lose their private keys which essentially locks their balance. As BTC price increases, the incentive to better store private keys also increases, so it is fair to say bitcoin's supply deflation is minimum in the long run. 
Back to price levels - one bitcoin can be divided in one million satoshis. If it proves itself to be a store of value over time, price levels will adjust accordingly (and precisely).

BTC was created to be fully decentralized. Larger block sizes can and will further centralize the network and foster an environment for mining cartels or oligopolies. If transactions are only being validated by a select group of people, how is that decentralized? It is not

Doubling block size would necessary require a hard fork

Still a hard fork masked as an update. It's not backwards compatible and because of the controversy there will necessarily be two chains.

I would add that the China ban has the potential of decreasing the participation of Chinese mining cartel. Mining is a capital intensive activity since you often have need to liquidate part of your holdings to pay for electricity, buy new ASICs and pay rent. Banning exchanges will affect liquidity and drive miners away from the country, which overall can result in a more decentralized network.

Exactly.... when will this shit end? Is SegwitABC8x next?
