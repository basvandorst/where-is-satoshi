Pls pin it back. Its hard to find for newcomers. I just tried to show my friend who was interested in learning about BTC and I couldn’t find it to show her. I’d imagine there are plenty more newcomers that would have missed it. Thank you.

Tax is a form of funding public works to improve standard of living, security and safety. To decide what public work to invest in, elected officials in our local, state and national levels write policies to make these decisions.
Bitcoin will allow people to pay for a certain public work to show their demand for it. 
So basically there would be a decentralised process of funding public works. Remember, tax rev is not the goal, public works is the goal. In fact decentralised public works funding might even be cheaper because we won’t have to pay for bailouts or any corrupt official for that matter. 
[Antonopolous - Currency wars &amp; Bitcoin]( 
People will say this won’t work: “No one will pay for public works because they don’t want to spend their cryptocurrency”. Truth is, people will pay to keep their family and friends safe and healthy. And they have the option to pick their best choices. This process of getting people to do good is engrained in the idea of bitcoin, its game theory. Whatever blockchain process that people use to choose what public works to fund, they will be rewarded for participating in the process by being rewarded, just like miners are.

They actually go a step higher. They use the steam from the plant to turn cotton into fabric. They basically have factories attached to power plants. Mining from power plants isn’t a bad idea, even if output would be low (for now)

Yes this is a major problem that need fixing, people have no idea they can buy a fraction of bitcoin. May be the superbowl ad should be “buy a fraction of bitcoin”
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:38:39

Its not about the 10x bro, its about the long run of seeing bitcoin reach the finish line to the point where fiat doesn’t exists. Its not about 10x, its about a dream.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:21:16

It is fragile, we’re gonna have to go through our .COM crash and then reemerge like web 2.0, Cryptocurrencies 2.0 will emerge after a massive crash of ICOs
The morale of the story here is that there will always be a bright side no matter how ugly it could get, just be smart, patient and make sure u find your google, ebay and paypal to move on to crypto 2.0
Edit: amazon too
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:08
Does that mean more demand, higher prices?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:19
