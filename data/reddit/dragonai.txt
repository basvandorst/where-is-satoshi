This is absolutely hilarious. I can't stop laughing. Thanks so much for sharing!

I completely understand. It's incredible how human we are, I've been able to sympathize with literally every sentence of yours.
It'll all clear up soon, man. Hope your week is sunshine from here on out.

The huge amounts all over this thread are pretty shocking, but your comment is the one that actually made me feel a pang of hurt. The high-rollers here are losing huge amounts of money, but you come down to the smaller-scale level of normal guys like you and me, and that's where you see real sadness.
I'm sorry man. It's disheartening how frustrating life can become when these things just pile up. I know exactly how you're feeling. Unexpected losses just hitting one by one, and it feels like life is just against you. It makes you want to curl up and withdraw from everything for a while.
Keep your head up, pal. I didn't have any money in Mt. Gox, but I have most definitely been in your shoes. It sucks. But it will get better, brother. It will. Feel absolutely free to hit me up to talk, play a game, anything. I don't normally offer that to people, but I've had weeks like yours and your comment sincerely struck a chord with me.

Adrian Chen? I'm just gonna nope my way out of here.

Seriously, I'm loving it. Excellent work, OP.

Yeah, so far from what I've seen, the most convenient way is via the merchants who are using Google Checkout. It's marked up, but extremely straightforward. It's really up to you to weigh the options haha.

No problem. You're a practiced and accomplished artist and I don't expect to match this kind of incredibly high quality anytime in the near future. But I sure plan on learning my way forward with the inspiration I get from ballers like you! Have a great Thanksgiving man.

Wow. Fantastic job.
May I ask what tools you used for this? Ever since discovering DigitalBlasphemy so many years ago, I've always been enamored with the work of artists like yourself. I really want to get into it as a hobby. :)

1.) Ah, thanks for clarifying! I know the bot automatically picks up on parent comments, but wasn't sure about original posts, so I just included it to be safe. :)
2.) I will adopt this going forward. Good call.
