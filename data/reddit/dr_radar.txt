Thanks for that. I haven't shared them. I will try Mycelium (getting it for android now).
I believe I know the password. If I can't recover with words I will try this openssl decrypt you mention.

When using Mycelium app on my phone and the 12 word recovery option I have a problem. When typing the words there seems to be an allowed list. The words I have are not on this allowed list. Any thoughts?

Trying it now

When trying this app on my PC I go for the option to import a wallet. Then enter the 12 words and I get an error "Could not import: Wallet Recovery Phrase is invalid"

Going here I get the option to enter the 12 words. When I type them in it seems that I can't click continue. Its almost as if it isn't accepting those 12 words as a recovery phrase.

I have my bitcoins in a wallet application on my Mac called Multibit. I also have Bitcoin Qt installed. How would I "move" or "import" my bitcoins in the Bitcoin Qt app? 
I see that I can export "private keys" from the Multibit app but how would I import my "wallet" to show the balance in the Bitcoin Qt app. 
I apologise for my ignorance!

Yeah, I have seen it is very volatile so only invested a small amount. I will ride it out and see if it will double, triple over the next few months..

Is it an issue that I have a ".key" file backed up from multibit and Bitcoin Qt backup files are ".dat" files?

Thanks for reply. I have exported the keys from multibit and saved as a "XX.key" file. I've used the command 
"importprivkey Filelocation/bitcoinkeys.key"
To try and import them. But got the error 
"Invalid private key (code -5)"
Any advice?
