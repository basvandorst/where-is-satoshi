Some people outside Venezuela like myself send remittances to their families, that's one way to survive the crisis.

That's not how SUBE works, it's a prepaid card that you can use for transportation, what Bitex is doing is provide a platform so you can add credit to the card using Bitcoins.

Venezuela: Hold my beer!

Have you tried regtest? I think that's what you need instead of testnet.

Of course it's a risky game, but in a country where i'ts illegal for a regular person to buy any stable fiat from any other country, Bitcoin comes out as an alternative.

A lot of us don't live in first world countries. For example, Bitcoin is very popular in Venezuela, there, having 1000$ is only for the richest people.

Well, I have to recognize, not everywhere is accepting bitcoins, but some stores do, like Traki, and about exhanges, localbitcoins is the most popular over there, because people makes transactions between them, using their personal accounts, with obviously a warning of not saying that it's a bitcoin transaction.

Well, you might do it, but it's not easy, you have to go to black markets in order to do so. You can cash out but in the country fiat, Bolivares.

I'm from Venezuela, no, they're not lies, they're not Libertarian wishwash, Bitcoin is in fact very popular in Venezuela as it can be. Obviously most people don't know about cryptocurrency but I'm very sure it's a lot bigger percentage than it shows in the graph, most people I know from Venezuela knows about Bitcoin. You can make a search in r/vzla and see by yourself.

Yeah! I really liked the video, it was emotional and inspiring!, but it is not the same thing at all.

Actually you are advise in localbitcoins to not say to Paypal you're trading it with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:01:46
Well, I don't think anyone sane enough (at least in Venezuela) would reject Bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:01:32
Would you send me a link that talks about it? All I can find in google are links that establish Bitcoin as a scam, but I don't feel they're satisfactory enough.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:19:08
This, a lot of people says, Bitcoin is a scam, Bitcoin is not used anywhere, when the truth is, those people live in first world bubble without realizing the World is bigger than they think.

In Venezuela Paypal is vastly used, usually freelancers work on a job that pays with paypal and change the USD$ to bitcoins or bolivares using localbitcoins, so I don't think Paypal will die anytime soon.
