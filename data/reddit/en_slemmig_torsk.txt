And Swedes on Reddit. They think they are like some sort of endangered species that people want to photograph or something.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:32:45
"Swede here...", "I am actually Swedish and...", "In Sweden, where I am from..."
It's basically "As a girl on the internet, I think..."
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:16:44
I feel bad about relating to this so much.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:17:51
Just the tips.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:06:14
Oh no. Not ideologues! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:46:16
It really isn't.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:07:13
Let me know if you see any.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:58:28
"BTC Motherfucker" ffs
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:00:02
Yes, except the question marks!!!
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:13:47
Hodling turned out to be great avdice!

Or carbon copies?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:31:08
I am hodling on for dear life.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:04:18
Yeah you say that but I really wonder sometimes...
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:18:31
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:03:15
Ok I'm new here, so there's two new bitcoins- BCH and something not BCC  because they're the same, and the former will be forgot about quicker than the other. So, do I sell, or buy?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:30:53
Well spoken.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:35:55
Gentlemen, we've been bamboozled!
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:51:30
Did they play Yakety Sax? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:03:45
While I consider this a win, it is kind of ironic how slow the network just became...
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:22:16
This is kind of where I'm at right now as well. I'm really just a noob trying to navigate this swamp, it's sad to see really, because it seems that no matter what happens we all lose.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:25:18
Yeah hand them over.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:11:04
I said that I don't think it is a very good analogy, not that it is inapplicable.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:38:35
You made me shit a little brick thinking about that.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:48:11
Ok, so I've been trying to read up on this whole mess and what I got from it is that as more and more people get into bitcoin, the network becomes congested, with transactions taking longer and (if I understand correctly) costing more.
That seems straight forward enough, so how is "our" current bitcoin going to deal with that problem?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:52:22
Well, that's for right now, but what about later? Won't we eventually have to increase block size anyway? I'm sure this is about more than block size, but I'm really trying to wrap my head around one thing at a time...
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:48:43
Ok, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:57:19
Buy. Trade. Snort.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:39:56
Well we did frivolously bomb and maim the population of a lot of Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:40:25
"factual opinion"
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:20:32
Argh, I'm going nuts over this, "they" are saying the same thing about "us". I suppose I'll stick with the status quo for now, but I can't say this whole ordeal instills me with confidence in the future..
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:33:03
One of the few times you hear about cognitive bias in the completely correct context!
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:39:23
The only way to learn is the hard way.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:31:02
I'm with you, fam.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:51:02
Thanks a lot, it's really hard to separate good sources from bad, that's the problem I have with my googling. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:09:35
Goxx me once...
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:18:15
While we have you on the line, and sorry for butting in, but is there like a central repository of papers, manuals, rundowns, tutorials, whatnot, for everything that is being discussed here? 
I'm really trying to wrap my head around all of this but doing it just by reading forums is a slow and highly suboptimal process. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:40:56
Now THAT is taking it to the next level!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:50:25
If something is available and for sale, someone will buy it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:31:16
I don't think that's a very good analogy, this is more of an ideological battle.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:42:22
And go on to write 50 Shades Of Gay
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:40:24
He's just a piece of shit?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:33:34
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:41:09
I will hold my breath! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:41:45
He already mentioned the Clin-Tons! They are hatching their eggs as we speak.
