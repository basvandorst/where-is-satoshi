Piece of shit ruined all hobby home mining and everyone who want to enjoy home mining. True shit driving mining into corporate level of mining and ruining profit every day destroying mining into few cents after paying electricity bills! Face the monopolism in mining... Where is the regulation..

What about cloud mining and difficulty? Few days ago was - 45 blocks behind today is barely - 10 blocks behind...  End of this diffuculty period looks like next difficulty will be no less than 4-5%. Where is the end of difficulty increase  i joined cloud mining at 19k price  3/4 and 1/4 new price   and looks i will lose and end.... Totally unprofitable. I wish i cashed out instead buying big TH contract since difficulty increase very very fast and becoming super unprofitable but diff keep increasing
