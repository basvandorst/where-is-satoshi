I see an easy attack in three not very difficult steps:
1) Bitcoin mining is pretty centralized in a few countries. Local governments storm and take control of the physical mining facilities and mine for example empty blocks. Mempool goes to infinity.
2) The community reacts and hard fork to another PoW algorithm. That would create possible multiple hard forks. Governments wait for the one with more consensus. 
3) If the winning fork (if there is one) uses CPU the governments now have a very easy and cheap attack to finish it: Use their computing power to 51% attack it. They have lots of computing power and even can ask for voluntary help of nocoiners giving them some incentives to join some governments pools as 'good citizens' and fight those pesky bitcoiners.
PoW use physical machines concentrated in very few places. Is not that difficult to find them if they want.

If bitcoin price doubles it will be profitable to spend more energy that can not be used for other purposes. 
If it is profitable, people will do it. There is no way to reduce CO2 emissions if price goes up.

I do not understand your response. Monero is fully private and works using a blockchain. The  pseudoanonimity of bitcoin is good enough for me *now*, so I keep them. But full anonimity is an interesting option too, so I keep Monero... In my particular case, european governments are working with european exchanges and companies that  trace transactions of european users. So blockchains with different properties than bitcoin is very useful for us. Not trying anything illegal here... Just keeping a little of economic privacy.

Sorry, your information is wrong. If you want to have the bitcoins that miners generate in one hour, you should buy six times that quantity, that is 37.5 BTC.
With only 6.25btc you will have for just 10 minutes of mining (post halvening).
Please buy more.

If a few governments wanted to illegalize bitcoin and decided to intervene those datacenters to just mine empty blocks, you would have the same problem. Nobody is free of having a few powerful guys ruining the party if they want. 
Just now, we do not disturb them enough.

It gives a bad image of bitcoin, not the euro.

3. You are talking about true private economic transactions: Monero for example.
4. You are talking about programmable money or smart contracts, for example, ethereum.
Bitcoin is nice and I have a few of them, but it is not the only use case for blockchain.

If two or three important countries with mining farms decide to coordinate and pass legislation to take control of them for free. Just mining empty blocks, not even attacking, you get a collapsed network.

How does that solve a problem for the environment? The gas is going to be burned anyway. 
They are going to get some btc for burning gas. Those btc mined are not going to be earned by the peoplo who mine using greener energy.
What they win is lost by the ecological miners.

Short it then. You will become rich if you are right. Enjoy.

I would get a MASSIVE SHORT position leveraged X100, then I will move just 1 satoshi. No need to touch the rest of the wallet to become rich.

How are you going to convince a resourceful person to work? He can not save money, even  working harder than you.

Governments can print all the money that they want to exchange for crypto. If you don't see crypto escalating continuously in price, they are not doing it. Paper is cheap.

For that new algorithm there shouldn't be many ASICS available, isn't it? All actual bitcoin miners should have their own ASICS unusable. 
The only defense then is the users mining with their own CPU, but that battle should be even easier to win for any state.  I'm I wrong?
