Looking for advice:
I bought a small amount of litecoin (\~$60) when it was about $100 a month ago. My thought was to wait for the small rally after its halvening and trade for BTC. Needless to say, the halvening was very disappointing and I did not follow through with the trade due to such a small bump in price. I'm now \~$5 in the hole with the LTC investment. Should I just go ahead and eat the cost and trade it in for BTC as I had originally planned? Or hodl my very small amount of LTC, and pray the crypto gods smile upon me in the future?

Thoughts on this anyone? Real News? Fake News?
The consensus on:  [   is that this is just a marketing scheme. Hmm.... Seems fishy to me.

Excited for this upwards trend!
Do the more experienced HODLers find that Bitcoin's price is almost always inversely proportional to the stock market(s)? Are there exceptions to this rule?

Yeah, I figured as such. The months leading up to it I read a lot of hype, and I guess all it was is hype. I'll take your advice and hope to see the price rise in the future.

Buy high, sell low... right? Am I doing it right?

So.... the real question of our generation:
# HODL
How does one pronounce it? Does it rhyme with "coddle" or "yodel" ?
Can this pressing question ever be answered in our lifetimes???
