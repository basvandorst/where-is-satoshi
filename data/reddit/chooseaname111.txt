There are so few times this has happened in a modern economy that we have no accurate example to compare it to.

Ledger works perfectly with electrum + eps
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:50:18
Fuck coinspot it's not a real exchange the prices are way higher than independent reserve and btcmarkets.net
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:44:37
Yeah. It looks cool though.
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:49:48
Use btcmarkets.net imo. 
Yes every exchange acts as a wallet but you'd be wise to withdraw to your own hardware wallet once you get more experienced
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:59:57
The target range? Mate the economy is completely fucked, the debt is out of control and yet you *STILL* believe that the current system works?
@_date: 2019-07-06 09:41:19
....? Not everyone who buys a ledger runs a full node, but the ability is certainly there. Electrum works great with my ledger. Smoking too much of that hash mate.
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:15:26
Hahah that's a funny way to look at it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:30:05
It's currently higher than this price right now haha.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:14:23
Good luck, great to see new exchanges popping up. 
For anyone new to Aus exchanges, I still recommend the tried and tested btcmarkets.net over anyone new. 
They have been around for like 5 or more years.

Given that his wealth exists primarily in shares, some days he has gained a billion over the course of a few hours.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:35:42
What part about it is bs? His data is correct, there have only been 70 days with a higher price than today is what he is saying. Nothing wrong with that stat.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:05:29
When he finally gets fucked in court the media may stop referring to him in anything but fraudulent light.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:28:54
Yeah I'm getting it too.

Go look at the chart Einstein. The current price is higher than any other day bar 70 during that run in 2017.

His answers are all correct though..
Once coins are associated with you it's quite hard to unlink them and requires things like wasabi and coinjoin. Governments watch hacked coins and exchanges try to reject hacked coins from their systems.
Which parts of his answers didn't you agree with?
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:03:37
So how does a negative yield Bond work?
Is someone paying me to buy it?
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:56:02
No don't consolidate wtf kinda advice is this.

My girlfriend was eagerly awaiting her personal moon of 300,000 THB only for it to fly right past and settle on 330,000. Her emotions were.... mixed to say the least.
Sometimes when something we really want happens, we don't know what to do next.

No one owns that address lol the coins are gone.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:52:23
Take a screenshot from that electrum tab I wanna see which site you used.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:38:51
You understood the title wrong, he is saying the price has been higher than today only 70 days in Bitcoins history. 
For 98% of the days it's been around, the price has been lower than today. So if you didn't buy during one of those 70 days then you are in profit right now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:48:18
I'd say do this, or maybe wait till we high ATHs again and then do it. Don't sell too early as you may regret it but pulling out half at a good valuation and sticking it in a good mix of index funds would certainly prevent any more grey hairs from growing.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:48:55
You're the one focusing on emotions and not on facts.
It is a cold hard fact that the price of bitcoin has only been higher than today for 70 days out of its entire 9 year existence.
What's so hard about that for you to accept, there's nothing emotional about it. It's a fact.
You're talking about buying and selling but thats not what this post is about. And what are you smoking to think that less than 1% of investors hold, thats literally the main investment strategy of every successful investor. Warren Buffet buys and holds until a period way in the future when he decides to sell.
He has held his shares in BRK for like 40 years, bitcoin is just 9 years old, yes people do buy and hold.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:47:59
Never buy after multiple days of a rising prices doesn't anybody understand this??
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:22:24
No ones, you can generate addresses that are valid but have no owner.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:45:22
Haha thanks for the laugh OP

We only post in 1k increments.
When we hit 100k we can switch to posting the price in 10k increments.

Go into coins tab and check that you haven't frozen any
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:06:09
For me it's Bitcoins and sats nothing else.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:29:12
No one is saying they did, the post is saying IF they did, they would be in profit. Common sense bro.

Study hard, be creative and you could just make your own gains if you start a successful company. 
Zuckerberg is worth the equivalent of 6 million bitcoins.

@_date: 2019-06-23 01:44:08
what about those who bought bitcoin &lt;$100, does your money also belong to us?
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:49:01
Don't worry, the constant price movement should adequately mix those pixels around.

This is incorrect, the amount traded to reach a higher market cap does not equal the market cap increase. The market cap is the last price it traded for times by total Bitcoins. 
When it was doing that run up in 2017 there was a low supply of sellers so each trade increased the market cap much more rapidly than the amount traded. 
For example, if the price is $100 now and I place a sell order for $101 which someone buys, the total amount traded is $101 but the market cap has just increased by $17,000,000.

I swear trading bots watch out for this meme and trigger their sell orders.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:42:55
Why is Bitcoin on that list, how is it at all related to GDP PPP?

Last price, 14 thousand dollarydoos downunder. 
That's all, carry on.

Well this is more to do with income levels than the digit value of your currency. 
Even if your currency was seemingly worth less (digit for digit), if the average income of your country is higher then people will find it cheaper going to other countries with lower incomes and cost of living, since an hour of their wages will buy more than what it can buy back home.

In Australia, when you renounce citizenship they treat it as selling all your assets and send you a bill for cap gains on everything you own.
Can't run from Big brother there.

Yes, go into coins tab (enable it in the dropdown settings tab) and right click spend.
Better is to just right click freeze the dust.

Yet how often do we actually hear about this happening.
Everyone always warns about wearing out your card yet I've never seen anyone actually use a (good quality card) long enough to wear it out...
