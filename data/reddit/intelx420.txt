@_date: 2019-03-25 01:25:34
Update! They are preparing package for shipment in a few hours, I will keep you guys updated. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 21:17:09
Looks shady as hell, do they generate the seed keys for you?
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:08:37
agreed, 3-5 should be given out to the reddit community to test. it's the only way you'll gain positive attention and something you will have to keep up, or reddit will come full force with pitch forks. I have recently set up a btc core node and am now setting up a lightning node, having a miner next to them would be ideal!
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:13:53
yeah, anyone near them that can confirm actual building or hole in the wall, anything?
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:19:30
Yep! Not looking good! I smell a scent of Dragon Gate Miners.
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:54:16
Well... I took one for the team, but i thought the receiver paid the custom and duty fees?
Hopefully they come through with it, they said April 3rd i should be getting my review unit.
Edit: thats the address i sent the custom and duty fees to.
@_date: 2019-03-28 04:41:41
This, Bruh you just became Old News.
Edit: Did you sign Prenup?
@_date: 2019-03-26 22:13:44
I am the one who took one for the team, My $50 in btc for custom and duty fees has been moved to this wallet now, which looks like with along someone else's $50. 
From now on we now know Dragon Gate Miners is a **scam** 
To end on a postive note! I got my lightning node set up and running along with my wallet! 
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:29:41
Once I receive tracking info sure, no problem. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:48:54
lol stop lying man, you did not make $1500 at most $100. Anyhow, we all now know. :)) I'll keep earning my BTC as you continue to fraud others, just remember when karma is knocking on your door please take a moment to remember me :)) 
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:20:13
Thats why i decided to take one for the team, if it's a scam, we will now have 100% concrete proof. each time they post or link that site we will all know now.
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:12:21

AWOOO To the Moon Forest
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:27:20
I got slightly confused by that article,
So to my understanding since i am using a 25th word passphrase, each time i want to send to my ledger i need to enter my 25th word if i want it to send to that generated wallet by the passphrase?, If i want to send to my main wallet just enter my pin only?
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:53:42
LMFAO, thanks, needed that.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:08:11
