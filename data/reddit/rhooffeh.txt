Are they using deprecated in the same sense that I would as a developer using Java?  I can mark items in source code as deprecated, but that doesn't mean they don't work any longer.  It just means that when you use them you get a warning that the functionality may be going away some day and you should consider moving to the replacement.

It's not really about root access.  It's just that closing your terminal session kills programs for you, which is really a feature, imagine if everything kept running every time.  You should be able to run bitcoind as a daemon process by adding "-daemon" to the command line.

I agree.  I have some friends who seem to be enjoying the game, but the signup process put me right off the idea of getting it via this method.  If I can buy it at a nice discount with bitcoin I'll give it a try, but what they really want is to expand their verified customer base.

No, there are more sophisticated schemes.
Mycelium, for instance, uses a two part process.  It generates a .pdf which you can store or print, and it also displays (only on screen, once per backup attempt) a set of letters which you have to write down.  How you keep this secured is up to you.  In my case I printed the .pdf, wrote the letters in the spaces provided, and keep it in a fire resistant safe.

As far as I can tell, Trezor and Ledger both seem to be good ways to go.  The Trezor costs a bit more but gives you a slightly easier flow in daily use since it's got a built in display.  The Ledger Nano or HW.1 offers a Chrome app that I imagine would run on your phone and it's inexpensive, but I'm not sure about the USB compatibility.  They do offer an adapter for micro USB ports but the site specifically says it's for "Android" phones.
I purchased a Ledger Unplugged recently, which is really just a Fidesmo smart card with a Ledger app running on it.  I got it during the recent bitcoin price spike and it's only 29 Euros equivalent in the first place, so I felt like I got a pretty decent deal.  I do have some paper with secrets on it that I have to keep hidden, but I also have a fireproof safe, so that's a pretty easy call for me.

Lots of people seem to have their first order or two canceled by Coinbase.  It happened to me, too.  I emailed them to complain, they investigated and cleared my account.  Purchases made after that process went through fine.
It's annoying, no two ways about it.  Coinbase seems to have their filters set to automatically reject many people until a manual review has been performed.  My first failed purchase was for a tiny amount, a few dollars just as a test.
It doesn't have anything to do with the character of the person involved, I don't think.  Nor is it really an indictment of bitcoin itself, it's just an indicator that this particular company has gone a bit farther than necessary in terms of fraud prevention.

I used to think that, too, but what I realized eventually was that TA isn't really about analyzing the changing values on a chart.  It's about human psychology.  To a certain extent, human behaviors can be predicted.  Certainly it's not 100% accurate, but 51% would be enough to come out ahead.  If you can draw some correlations between how prices change and how people react to those changes, there's something to the idea that you can get out ahead of it by a bit now and then.
That being said, I'm not a practitioner, as I prefer fundamental analysis and holding dividend paying equities for the long term.  From that point of view, Bitcoin isn't really a great fit for my investing style.  However, the potential is big enough that I have to be in it, at least a little bit.

I certainly haven't found a good argument against it!
Bitcoin to me, this year at least, is a commodity investment.  It makes sense to be invested in it, a bit.  But holdings don't pay dividends, and the fiat value of the holdings are subject to the whim of a very fickle market.  If you time it right you can make a fortune, if you time it wrong you can lose one.  That being said, I *think* we saw a near-to-mid-term bottom at around the 200 dollar level in recent months.  I can't swear that it will never be back down there, but we appear to be on a rising slope of value since then.

The cause of the situation is unimportant to the argument I am making.  I was not proposing a mechanism behind the lack of wage growth, just pointing out the fact of it.

Of course inflation has an impact if you are living paycheck to paycheck.  There's always a lag, sometimes a significant one, between consumer prices rising and wages increasing.  In fact, over the last 30 years or so real wages have pretty much completely stagnated for the working class.

Which of course, leads to volatility in both the commodity itself as well as in the equity of the producers thereof.  When something is profitable, massive investments are made by producers in finding and refining new sources.  Eventually they're making more than the market requires.  The price crashes, the value of the producers crashes, they cut back on exploration and production, which sets us up for the next swell in prices as demand outstrips supply again.

OK, debit cards are closer, to be certain.  You still have a measure of fraud protection with that, as well as insurance on your holdings.  And one must understand that whiz-bang technology isn't going to sell anything to the average user, who is looking for convenience, safety, and speed.

Opinions differ on the matter.
I personally use coinbase to purchase, then I transfer the coins elsewhere.  There are many perfectly valid wallets out there, from Bitcoin Core to Mycelium.  Some people think no bitcoin is safe unless it's been transferred to a wallet generated on a machine that has never known the sweet caress of an IP packet, others think that online services such as Coinbase are safe enough.

I tried Circle.  It wouldn't let me attach my account.  Eventually customer service got back to me and said to try again but by that time I had tried Coinbase, which involved two failed transactions over the course of several days followed by eventual success (after several contacts with customer service).  Since I had accomplished my initial goal of purchasing some bitcoin, I never did go back and try again with Circle.
Overall I'd say the experience was more frustrating than I really like.  The industry needs to mature a bit if it wants to capture the hearts and minds of the public at large.
Fortunately for bitcoin in general, it's not like banks will pay enough interest to make holding money in a savings account look particularly appealing.  For now at least there is a competitive environment.

Technically it's the viewpoint of an investor who is in the accumulation phase of his or her life, regardless of the specifics of the investment.
Last Summer a company of which I own a part disappointed a lot of people because it announced it wouldn't be doing a dodgy tax trick to save a few bucks.  It crashed in value.  I smiled and purchased as much as I could.  Those shares are up about 36% as of right now.

Both of those statements seem true to me.
I can't do anything about the second, but I do have some thoughts on the first.  My first thought is ripped directly from Warren Buffett:
"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful."
When things look their worst, when ALL sentiment has turned negative, when nobody has anything good to say, that's the time to strike.  It's difficult.  It goes against our nature.  It's as profitable as hell.
Perhaps that time has not yet been reached.  There is still a good bit of positive sentiment.
Similarly, when nobody has anything bad to say, it's seriously time to consider taking some profits.  It's not different this time.  It's never different this time.

If people by and large weren't responsible enough to pay back their debts, the banking system would never have developed into the behemoth it is.  Look at the housing crisis.  The economy was brought to its knees by delinquent mortgages, but prime borrowers with fixed rate loans only went into default at a maximum of around 5%.
It was adjustable rate mortgages, particularly those made to "subprime" borrowers (people who basically never should have received loans in the first place) who defaulted in large numbers.  The mortgage originators didn't really take due care with this, in large part because they were just packaging up and selling off the notes anyway.
Anyone who has been active in the financial markets long enough saw it happening.  20 years ago getting a mortgage was a difficult, onerous process, requiring massive amounts of paperwork essentially constituting proof that the borrower could pay back the loan without going broke.  10 or 12 years ago or so that started to change in a big way, and by the brink of the crisis they were just throwing money at people without requiring much (if anything) in the way of surety.

Just another point to consider:  If I purchase something with a credit card, I have a month or so before I must actually pay the bill.
