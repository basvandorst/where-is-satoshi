The correct punishment for such a breach should be horrific. I'm thinking something along the lines of forcing every executive and developer responsible for this to sit through a thirty hour Bieber concert while lines of angry Bitcoin investors line up and tattoo whatever they like onto the perpetrator's faces.
On a serious note, Gox should be dissolved and it's assets used to partially pay back the losses of whatever poor schmucks still use their services. Then their servers should be burned to slag along with all source code, and then plowed into the ground of the datacenter, then salted so that their incompetence can never rise from the dead again.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:49:34
It is in MtGox's financial best interest to push the price lower if they have a lot of coins to replace that have been lost through their incompetence in handling malleable TXIDs. 
So the cost to them is less in fiat to pay back who they owe (or recover their personal lost bankroll if that is what they paid it out of)
You can't expect a company to actively work against it's own profit, can you?
So I predict more foot dragging and malicious press releases that actually don't accomplish anything until BTC is USD 200, then they buy back and the fix magically appears over night. 
And again the Bitcoin community pays the price for MtGox's failures. 
It is a sick dog and needs to be put out of our misery.

@_date: 2014-02-10 12:28:00
Excluding Gox, we will be back past 700 before 5pm Eastern Time today. 
A failure on MtGox's part to address malleable TXIDs (a non-issue known about for years) does not constitute a major threat to the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:17:20
Decentralized currency and corporate responsibility aren't mutually exclusive ideas. If a company cannot deliver on their promises, or worse, are found to be manipulating the prices for their own ends (I am not a conspiracy theorist, but the fact that this press release comes at a time when Mtgox is obviously having issues is suspicious), then they should be held responsible. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:27:02
Oh yes, I am going to be That Guy. 
I would argue that MtGox has gotten in the way of growth far more than they have helped. This isn't 2011 where they are the only game in town. There is too much money to be made with Bitcoin for them to have existed in a vacuum. If MtGox hadn't come along, others would have, and already have. 
In fact, I would argue that bitinstant and crowd marketing have done more for BTC than MtGox after all of the losses are calculated in. 
Don't you find it funny that during the first two biggest moments of growth in our early history, MtGox shat itself and dropped the price by 30%-50% within minutes? And both because of scaling issues on their part?
Malleable TX IDs are a non-issue for anyone with half a brain, and as you pointed out, have been known for about 3 years. 
Considering the metric assload of cash that MtGox is raking in every day, I consider it pure negligence that they haven't hired a large team of competent developers. 
Hell, I'm not even a database guy and I know that making a known value that can be changed as the key for tracking multiple millions of dollars worth of value is a level of monumental stupidity that is inexcusable in any company. 
I will neither upvote or downvote you, but I will tell you this piece of advice for free: Stop working MtGox's shaft, they have proven themselves unreliable and ineffective. I haven't used them in years for this exact reason.

I think it is time we crowdfund a stack of lawyers to put a legal bullet in the slowly rotting corpse of MtGox.

@_date: 2014-02-11 18:58:52
I can see buying bitcoins elsewhere, sending to Gox to sell to USD before a drop, then buying back BTC at the bottom and transferring them out.

With bitcoins, the standard model of fractional reserve banking is impossible. 
Standard model:
Bank has 1 million dollars on hand, so it can create balances for up to (whatever the Federal Reserve states, lets just pick a number and say:) 7 million in loans. 
So there is only one million REAL dollars in deposit, if all 7million of those loan dollars try and get withdrawn, bank shuts down. 
Since the other 6mil is pretty much made from nothing, it can be done. 
You can't just make bitcoins from nothing, so fractional reserve banking doesn't work. 
1mil bitcoins in deposit means only 1mil can be lent out, no magical creation of imaginary wealth, this is bitcoin's strongest point

Escrow is only the beginning, this advancement in secure multi-party transactions could pave the way to a whole new system of transaction types.
Secure pooled resources, like joint accounts with better oversight.
Guaranteeing that bitcoins you donate to a charity get used at a specific vendor or group of vendors (this would also be great for college parents to make sure that the money they spend gets put towards food or clothes, and not other things that college students are likely to buy)
It could also change the way we purchase commodities futures, and act as a better hedge against contract default than our current draconic system of contract law.
Think of it, money where you can determine (through consensual agreement of course) where the receiver is allowed to spend it. That in and of itself revolutionizes transaction methodology. Bitcoin, not just for escrow anymore. 
@_date: 2012-01-29 20:29:40

Some things OP doesn't understand:
1) Bitcoins are VERY very divisible. If hoarding occurs, that's OK, a very small pool of bitcoins can be divided into tradeable units for everyone to use. 
The price of bitcoins will go up, but keep in mind that in order for the smallest unit usually referenced (a Satoshi 0.00000001 BTC) to be made to be worth more than a penny would require an almost 80,000% rise in the value of a bitcoin, and at that level the hoarders will not be able to resist spending, and more coins enter the market. There is also discussion that the protocol could be extended to allow for even smaller divisions, but I don't follow those threads that much. 
2) This is not Fiat money, it is a trade token. Inflation isn't necessary because fractional reserve lending isn't possible with non-fiat currency.
3) Bitcoins aren't a useful currency for banks that 'make money on money', and that is part of the intent. This is a new form of currency, for a new paradigm of trade and value. Fractional reserve banking and inflation-based economics are what brought us to this worldwide financial crisis, why would we want to continue making the same mistakes that brought us here?
Personally, I think OP is a bank shill, but then I am well known for my angry paranoia.

Also there from the beginning, here's the deal:
In the beginning we were mostly true believer techheads with a dream and a lot of energy. 
Now those have mostly all gone, 2nd wave investors came, still early adopters. 
Those 2nd wave investors weren't techheads mostly, but moneyboys. But they were moneyboys curious about a new form of value, so learned Bitcoin and what it could do and how it was better (these are the ones that went off to create the more useful altcoins with actual funding like Etherium)
Then the markets tanked and they left for less volatile mediums and now the 3rd wave investors are here. 
They don't know shit about anything other than crypto makes money. 
They treat it as a trade token and nothing else, don't care about developing it , don't care about applications. 
Which is why so little real development has gone into Bitcoin when the latest flavor of alts all provide significant improvements over the oldschool blockchain model. 
TL;DR: money making asshats are pretty much all that are here now.

No, I am not implying anything. I am stating that he has a 0-day account. I post both here and at bitcointalk, and have done so for months now. 
I am also stating that he isn't arguing rationally, using informal fallacies and using half-truths. I have seen nowhere where Alessia has claimed to have never heard of Labcoin, and also have seen no credible evidence that Fabrizzio claimed to know nothing about the company. I have on the other hand seen plenty of statements that they are no longer involved. 
Additionally, Howard was only part of the project early on, and did not complete the 130nm chip designs. He was a consultant, not a partner, and likely not privy to what happened after he was paid. 
The tone and content of his argument is plainly calculated to rabble-rouse and inflame. 
There is no useful content here that is not posted more objectively elsewhere, and he knows it. But then, that doesn't drop the price of the stock enough for his kind, does it?

Alberto's posting style is only similar to labcoins in context, but not in pattern or verbiage. frankly I don't care what any of you do, I've always been in with labcoin for the long term.
here's why I personally don't think its a scam, burnside has repeatedly confirmed that the vast majority of shares held by members of the company have not been traded. if, as you insist, this is a scam all of the people involved with know this, and have dumped their shares long ago. there is no point in continuing a scam with the market cap so low, you literally could be making more money doing almost anything else with your time than trying to convince everybody that its not and hoping to sell out later.
the most interesting part about this is that you're spamming your message all over with an account that's less than 4 hours old. you have no credibility, barely any evidence, and here you want us to believe you're paranoid ramblings like you're some kind of bitcoin stock guru. you know you sound like somebody who spent a little too much time reading the Illuminatus trilogy and not enough time studying human psychology.

There wasn't a single transaction. Let me see if I can reconstruct what happened:
Was on BTC-e when I found out about the fork
immediately deposited all of my BTC to the above address
Dumped it into LTC
waited till LTC/USD rose to about .44
Dumped LTC to USD
bought BTC at $39
looked at my nice little 13someodd BTC account
Hey, I know it wasn't a lot of profit, but it was fun. 
BTC-e had frozen BTC withdrawals so I just sat around the chat discussing the fork for a few hours. No trading at all, just sitting on my BTC confident it would go back up
Then about 2 hours later my BTC holdings on BTC-e showed only the above...
Dev over at BTC-e says everything will be right once the blockchain finishes downloading... about an hour my rough guess...
We will see.... I'll update when the blockchain finishes.

Unless the whole point of the DDoS was to encourage people to buy on the cheap, driving the price up. And since the perpetrator knows exactly when the DDoS is going to end, can maximize their cheap purchases for sale just a few minutes/hours later.

Yeah, freaked me out one day after I cleared my cache. I was wondering how the difficulty went up so high in 12 hours. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:22:12
Oh man are you going to be sorry...
Here is why:
Everyone thought silkroad was an upward pressure, as people are buying bitcoins to buy drugs. 
But what no one considers is that all of the dealers out there had to sell their coins to get their cash. 
I can't picture drug dealers having any confidence in bitcoin as a currency yet, except as an intermediary. 
So, hypothetically, every single bitcoin they made was cashed out for fiat currency. 
Yet not every single silkroad buyer was buying bitcoins to use. From my impression of the forums, many of the bigger buyers were actually sitting on piles of bitcoins back when they were ultra-cheap. 
Therefore, silkroad was actually a suppressing force on the value of bitcoin. 
I don't think Cyprus had much to do with the last boost, as far as blockchain analysis has shown us, few people from there even bought coins. There had been plenty of bitcoin media exposure just before the event. 
So again, I don't think that Baidu is the biggest factor. Sure now they are offering to accept bitcoin for their services, the amount of business they engage in wouldn't in itself justify the jump. 
Disclaimer: In it for the long haul, at least for the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:28:05
Silkroad sells a lot more harmful stuff than weed... And anyone who orders weed through the mail underestimates the power of narc dog's noses.

Another interesting thought: What if we all buy up those 250,000 delicious cheap coins that the script-kiddies will be dumping before they have a chance to instigate panic? 
Profit for us, loss for them, and maybe one more DDoS cadre will be financially harmed enough to go away and get real jobs. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:33:47
So, let me see if I can TL;DR:
Howard gets a contract to design some chips, designs 180nm's, almost finishes 130nm's, but doesn't because of communication problems. 
Alessia is a flake, doesn't pay on time, but eventually does. 
She has problems getting the chips fabbed, finally pays Howard, and says she has someone else to finish the 130nm's. 
Howard hasn't heard from her since. 
So, how does poor management skills = scam?
At this point, no matter what gets posted, some yahoo is going to type scam in all caps on it and toss it around bitcoin sites like it's confetti at a Mardi-Gras parade.
Also, nice zero day account you have there Mr. @_date: 2013-03-23 22:14:18
Except that a rapid drop in price isn't beneficial to money launderers either. 
Additionally, Google trends clearly shows a massive spike in Bitcoin searches, indicating quite a lot of interest from the public. 
I'm not really sure that Cyprus caused it, I doubt it has, but the articles and youtube videos of the last 2 months are clearly behind the recent swell. 
I also want you to consider, even after the most recent 'crash', people just saw that as an opportunity to buy cheap coins, and recovery was just a matter of hours/days. 
Even then, even at the lowest the market is today, it is still far better than it was a month ago. 
No need to point to conspiracy theory and draw conclusions from assumptions. Just keep your coins safe and enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 01:44:16
Old fashioned usury is what paved the way for the current economic collapse. 
I agree that current bitcoin holders are far less likely to deposit to a lending bank, this may, and indeed almost must, change as as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted. 
The very fact that the 'interest wave' is possible asks the question of what will happen when it does.

@_date: 2013-03-10 20:11:05
TL;DR: No you are not too late. 
I want to point out that the decimal point in bitcoin is really throwing some people off. 
I struggled with this until I started playing around with micropayments and I realized something:
Someone once tipped me .2 bitcoins back when they were worth around $2.50 a piece. Basically 50 cents. 
At the time I was all like "cool, free soda"
Now that same .2 is worth $9, thats a decent lunch there my friend. 
So you can think of it as buying a fuckton of .1 bitcoins.
Sure, your growth won't be as astronomically exponential as the guys who got in around year 1, but still you are looking at so much possible future growth. 
More and more brick and mortar stores are looking into bitcoin, legit investment sites are beginning to at least take a peek at bitcoin. 
The time is now, seriously. The only time we have had any serious problems when MtGox had problems. It wasn't a problem with bitcoin, but with it's exchanges. 
Now that more exchanges are cropping up, a single exchange failing can't drop the value of bitcoin so much as to cause a crash.
Now, I'm not an expert, even I can tell that this is still close enough to the very beginning to make putting some money into it. 
But as always, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:15:13
There will be several bubble pops in the next 5 years, but the upward trend even at the bottom of the last few pops have been indicative of consistent growth. 
Other bubble pops have been caused in weak points in services that deal with bitcoin, not in bitcoin itself, the protocol or the concept. We no longer have a massive single point of failure in exchanges, we have also proven that Silkroad isn't the basis of bitcoin's value. 
Speculators can speculate. I am long on bitcoin, and have been since 2010.

this will be difficult as it is basically asking the exchange owners to not be greedy,  and only take the customers  they can handle.  this means they cannot be publicly traded companies as their mandate to their stockholders  requires them to make as much money as possible. 
I  believe that you  have a great idea here,  and it is the best alternative to  exchanges. 
 reddit is filed with highly talented coders and  tech heads,  if we could come up with a  low barrier to entry  Turkey exchange solution  and make it freeware, I  can see your idea  taking off.  the only hitch I  see is that it will allow unscrupulous  puerile to own exchanges  easily,  and some sort of confidence and trust list will be needed,  and even then it will not be perfect.

As I recall, she was replying to a specific statement by the Labcoin bitcointalk account that was used after she relinquished it, not a general statement of involvement about Labcoin.

No, your 0-day status simply means one of three things:
1) You are a troll that doesn't want to implicate your main reddit account (your name makes me think this is the most likely option)
2) You are a shill, who made an account just for the ability to FUD here since bitcointalk is down
3) You are a puppet, made to prop up other FUDding accounts, that have also been created within the last few days. 
Your lack of rationality comes from your use of informal fallacies, intellectual dishonesty, and clearly subjective viewpoint.

Ah! I didn't think of that, you are absolutely right on this point. 


The rough-and-ready entrepreneurial spirit that is currently thriving in China works perfectly with Bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if they were the first country to openly adopt it in an official, government sanctioned manner. 
And I personally love the fact that their eagerness is surging the market in the last few months.

Number one reason why I withdraw immediately all of my bitcoin buys from MtGox. 
And you are correct, I was completely wrong using the phrase "fiat currency" in my heading, I hope it doesn't cause too much confusion as I don't think it can be edited. I will modify my initial message though to reflect this. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:58:49
I don't think you understand exchange mediums that well. 
Stability isn't required for short term transactions, it is meaningless to a person who just buys some bitcoins to send to someone else with the intent of that other person to instantly sell them for local currency, therefore no matter how cheap bitcoins are, they still serve a purpose that they do better than anything else right now.
Also, are you telling me that if you had the opportunity to buy shares in the Amazon IPO, you would be worse of now than you were then?

@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:24
It seems that any time it starts to stabilize, i.e. not fluctuate more than a few dollars in either direction, people get nervous and start to sell. 
what we need is 5/6 of the bitcoins to not be moved to fiat or back, just spent on bitcoiny things. 
then let the 1/6 play on the market and we should see some stability. The big players don't understand, it's not to trade, it's to use.

You are operating under the common delusion that you think you understand how something as complicated as bitcoin trading works. 
You watch lines and graphs, and you make conclusions. 
And the simple fact is that nothing in your conclusions has any more validity than anything any other bitcoiner says. 
Because this elephant is entirely too huge for anyone to see completely. 
You think Bitcoin is being manipulated, Excellent! Show your reasoning. 
And don't cry like a little girl when we tear your fallacy-ridden reasoning apart like wet bathroom tissue.

@_date: 2013-05-04 16:31:37
that doesn't make sense. This would allow for a hostage situation on both ends:
Adam risks 10btc to sell Bubba 5btc
Bubba puts up 10btc risk and sends Adam $500 cash
Adam never delivers, now Bubba has the choice of just being out $500 cash, OR destroying the deal and being out $1500 cash. 
The only way the system has a chance of working is if either party can destroy the other's security with impunity. 
This leads to trolls. 
So you either have blackmailers or trolls, no way out of it.

You are correct that there is no way to create more funds to lend out, but it takes the depositors bitcoins and puts them at risk to the lendee's ability to repay. 
And it creates an interest wave that can never be repaid, exactly what leads to inflation and the need for an economy to grow. 
And that is in a perfect world where no lendees default and cause a loss of bitcoin for the bank.

@_date: 2013-01-01 23:35:04
I read the article, and I still don't see how it is possible, or even beneficial. 


Then what is available for withdrawal isn't actually a bitcoin, it is a promise to provide a bitcoin. 
Since there is almost no advantage in storing digital currency in someone else's bitcoin address, I don't see what would motivate people to 'have on deposit' with a financial agency. Especially if the final result is in essence turning bitcoin INTO a fiat currency. 
But then again, people are in general greedy and stupid. The promise of interest will cause most people to forgo security and store their bitcoins with other people, and since it isn't actually a regulated currency, the holding banks will be free to offer as many 'promises to provide bitcoin' per real bitcoin they have on deposit as they feel they can get away from. 
And the wonderful experiment collapses, and the whole purpose of a secure, non-counterfeit-able digital currency is meaningless and pointless. 
This is why we can't have nice things...

Initial panic sell down to $30, faithful buyers will keep trying to bring that up but market manipulators will play it like a yoyo, extracting more and more wealth from people eager to cash out. 
This will go on for about 3 or 4 hours, maybe till morning, and then mtgox will crash again, either from DDoS attack or DDoS trades. 
No matter what, no one will ever have the same level of confidence in bitcoin again. It has become a sideline, a joke. 
Fear has broken the most effective means to overthrow the financial stranglehold that central banking has on wealth. 
This played out just like OWS: A lot of noise and interest, plenty of coverage for weeks and then, the opposition infiltrates, undermines, and disperses. 
The masses become disillusioned or fearful and move on back to their gray and shallow lives. 
A few hardcore faithful will remain, and the majority of the world will either consider them a joke, or at the very best, some people will respect them for having the fortitude that they did not.

ASICs will pool hashing power into the hands of a very few groups. The technologically capable, the wealthy, and the lucky. 
BFL is a joke, and their products will not ship in time for their buyers to recoup their costs, and many many GPU miners will flee to the altcoins, leaving a few pools powered mostly by a handful of ASIC miners.
As this happens, the generation of bitcoins will fall out of the hands of the common man, and I believe this will spell the eventual end of Bitcoin as the main cryptocurrency on the web. 
Most likely a scrypt based coin will rise next, possibly Litecoin, and will make early adopters wealthy just as Bitcoin did. Since scrypt by nature is resistant to ASIC mining, it will be longer before a better solution than GPU mining becomes available. And when it does, I predict yet another shift to another coin, and so on and so forth in an endless cascade of adoption, centralization, abandonment, and return to adoption.

Oh, it is to laugh!
That entire pastebin hosted chat doesn't even mention the name "Sam Noi", in any form. All you have him admitting to is that he is, indeed Fabrizio Tatti:


[02:17] &lt;route69&gt; informed you about the project?
[02:17] &lt;agath&gt; (I think I understand, but ask to be sure)
[02:17] &lt;route69&gt; you'd what? sorry I did not understand
[02:17] &lt;agath&gt; you'd rather 'who' :-)
[02:17] &lt;route69&gt; ah ok, Fabrizio Tatti
So, where is your link to the part where he admits to being Sam?


My sentence structure and word choice is far more elegant than anything Fabrizio or Sam has ever used, as I am a native English speaker. 
If you couldn't even realize that, how am I to trust your judgment on matters of far greater import, such as the claims you have made?
Also: Since my initial purchase, I have never sold my Labcoin shares. I have no intent to sell my shares, I have no desire to sell my shares. Either it will fail, and I lose a little, or it will succeed, and I will reap dividends.

That is what I am worried about, but whenever I mention it somewhere I am called paranoid. 
But the real question is, am I paranoid **enough**?

Bank offers interest on deposits
around 300 customers come and deposit 10 bitcoins each
The bank now has 3000 bitcoins. 
Guy with a business idea comes to bank for a loan
Bank loans him 1000 bitcoins at 10% interest
Bank has 2000 bitcoins
Depositors want to spend bitcoins so they use their bank debit cards to withdraw against their accounts that say they have 10 bitcoins. 
As long as the bank has less customers needing their bitcoins than they have bitcoins on hand, they can continue to operate. 
The lendee pays back the principle plus interest, and then all the depositors can come withdraw their entire account and the bank will be solvent due to the interest of the loan. 
But what happens when the loan goes bad, what happens when people want to leave the bank and want their entire account worth of coins?

Hey, I've been working on a modified series bet for satoshidice, but I'm very nervous about using what little coin I have to test it. Would you like to donate to the cause, for SCIENCE?!

Considering the traffic that has apparently flooded their site, I would expect the profits of the transactions would be more than enough to upgrade their infrastructure. 
But I agree, I am going to find a different way to buy my BTC for the near future.

Bitcoin wasn't this public in 2011. 
The bad press is what will end us, not the fundamentals. Nothing has changed with them other than we now see the need for robust transactions.
And yes, I was here, that's when I turned from a spectator into a miner.

Just want to point out that one illegal site gets shut down and you people lose your minds and dump and panic and sell sell sell. 
Thank you for the cheap coins!
Today, the bitcoin market is so much bigger than just one anonymous drug exchange. 
Personally I feel this will have a net boost on the bitcoin market now that cash-hungry drug sellers won't be constantly exerting downward pressure.

It isn't just bitcoin, it is everything. It isn't just people on reddit, it's everyone. 
When I was a child, I thought adults had all the answers, and once I became one I'd magically understand the optimal course for everything, and could choose at my leisure to follow or ignore this course. 
When I became an adult I realized that 99.9% of the world is making it up as they go along, and people trust those that are more right than they are wrong. 
A nobel prize winner things the internet is a useless fad, economists couldn't predict the largest global financial crisis ever, doctors that hold a lower success rate than simply ignoring cancer. 
The world is full of this, from top to bottom. From the most successful businessmen to the loudest drunk in the bar. 
That is the way the world is. 
Including me

Did you seriously just downvote me for giving you useful information?
@_date: 2013-01-02 00:07:27
I would love to believe that. 
I would agree with the statement that informed, intelligent people will always prefer a real fungible bitcoin over an IOU promise, but then greed and lack of understanding are going to tempt some bitcoin holders to banks by the promise of interest on deposits. 
I myself will always keep my wallet in my pocket and in 2 other secure locations. But as bitcoins become more popular, I fear the above becomes nigh inevitable. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:16:19
Bitcoin was developed to do away with the need for a central bank. 
The value of a currency such as bitcoin is set in the most free-market capitalist way possible, by what people are willing to pay for it. 
Unfortunately there is no way to mitigate the fear of loss in the masses. 
It will ultimately be that fear that can end bitcoin.

No, CrimsonKing harassed Alessia on facebook and she said she was not involved with Labcoin OR Armandi anymore, and that she was calling the police. 


If you check my post history here, you will see that I have commented and asked questions regarding labcoin for the last month and a half. 
Additionally, I have been moderately active on the IRC channel for at least three weeks. 
Lastly, I have also dragged myself through the literally hundreds of pages of crap FUDsters and puppet posts, gleaning what little actual data there is to be found. 
Before I ever bought Labcoin I spent a month looking into it, comparing the paranoid rantings of people like yourself with the actual tangible facts. 
Of which there was very little, a fact you well know. It was precisely of Panic FUDsters like yourself that I decided to give the company a bit of my capital, because of such a large group of people were so dedicated in convincing people of Labcoin's fragility with so little evidence, it had to be because you were artificially lowering the price to cash in big. 
Strange how all of this crap comes in patterns, right before big anonymous buys that none of the hardcore bagholders admit to. 
Who's buying it then? Hmmmmm?
