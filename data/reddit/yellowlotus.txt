It doesn't matter. No one will ever get paid back.

Someone posted something about this on my Facebook wall today..
Came to reddit to confirm.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for the kind words. I hope this thread reaches the right people before it's too late.

I searched this topic today because I am asking this SAME EXACT QUESTION: Q16. Is MtGox manipulating the price by directly purchasing Bitcoins on their own exchange?
After seeing the price drop last night I am absolutely convinced this whole stunt was a price manipulation. A scare tactic. And mt gox is buying up bitcoins at $300 a piece!

If he *does* end up in prison it will solidify bitcoin's future presence in society. All this, although bad news, its very good news for the future of alt currencies.

I'm so ashamed of myself for mining altcoins now...

I feel so awful for those who have lost out to gox... I truly empathize, and can only imagine that feeling of hopelessness and emptiness. To any of you reading this who have lost out, hang in there. It may be over, but there is always that ray of hope: the class action. Stay positive. You are not alone.

Oh my god, further, you're just trying to recover from losses by taking the money from someone else. Lol, what the fuck?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:46:27
How would I even prove in a court of law that I had coins on mtgox???
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:55:35
If you came here to defend mtgox then you're in complete denial. It's not wrong, it's expected, but the sooner you digest what's happened the sooner you can handle your loss. I feel sorry for those who have their life savings in mtgox but that's why you diversify. It's over.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:00:48
The 'mtgox tragedy'? Financial losses happen every day on wallstreet. People need to handle what happened and move on. Maybe make better decisions later, or, get a lawyer. Or be patient. People who lost money on mtgox should not be put on a pedestal. They should be learning a lesson and that's diversification. All this 'tragedy' does is make room for the next several scams regarding recovery. It's SO annoying. I can't wait to look at gofundme for bitcoin losses.

I'm sure that the Winkelvoss twins will eventually try to take some sort of credit for the creation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:06:32
Is there anyone out there that can prove this? Someone who won't sell out? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:13:28
If they got robbed they probably would have just said that. At least they would get sympathy from some. This is just bad business, maybe a ponzi scheme of sorts. The money was spent internally in hopes that bitcoin would continue to rise. Woops.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:05:53
$135 now. Heh, I really hope no one is buying anything on that exchange right now. If people are, then I just feel bad.
@_date: 2014-01-05 07:46:38
Makes you wonder about all the other currencies... doesn't it...

I can't wait to see someone hauled off in handcuffs. 
They had better have a good hiding place.

How will it make the FBI more money? I'm totally on this dude's side... but I'm pretty sure they're already spending more. I shouldn't even have to say that this is costing the tax payers even more money. Ugh, we're getting raped from every angle. Did you mean they'll make more by holding bitcoins? Like as an investment?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:52:34
I can definitely see how fedoracoin could be a good investment. The main reason is because it's cheap. Other similar coins have performed well. MOON grew approx 100x in a week.... which was just ridiculous... but it happened.
