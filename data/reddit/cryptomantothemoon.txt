I don't want to buy "things" I want to escape.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:05:32
I'm old and confused, this frightens and angers me....these kids shouldn't have access to wealth, we designed an entire system designed to keep them from it, gaahhh!
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:17:06
It is that simple...if you are pulling out a decent chunk of money, you should have bought that 15 dollar LLC license a long time ago.  Then you simply set up a meeting and they will transfer funds to that account all under the eye of your accountant and lawyer.  This isn't a lottery ticket....lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:38:37
Who are you trying to kid this isn't a discussion grow up
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:50
If stalking and worshiping me is your pleasure, that's sad.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:13:54
Then who do you charge if you can't prove it?  It's not illegal till you get caught.  That's what my drill sergeant told me 20 years ago.  Grow up and get with the program.  If you let fear make you a little pussy who doesn't get what he wants, then that's on you!
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:54:48
It is, go to DNM sub and read all the complaints about fees and tx times.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:15:33
They have actual proof in some of the threads. like indisputable proof.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:46:38
Yeah, don't talk politics, religion or bitcoin with friends or family LOL
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:40:17
You put your wallet on the cloud.  You will get no fucking sympathy or donations from me.  Dear guy who took my cooler from my open garage, I left all my life in that cooler, oops, you took it? Everyone feel bad for me :( no.  Welcome to the Wild West where men need to fucking be men.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:35:14
Would having a friend who's family is Cayman Island nationals help?  Since he can just take my usb to his country, cash out and put it in a bank account that nobody can touch and give me access.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:12:12
You think anyone believes me?
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:27:34
report it.  I mean...what else can you do, it's the wild west bro
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:10:47
I could always just buy my own hash account....
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:00:04
OOOO I just got HATE WRECKED!
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:33:20
Huh. Never noticed that
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:16:42
You would be a LLC by that point and its big boy business done in boardrooms with lawyers.  It's not like a winning scratch off lottery ticket lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:34:45
Pretty much what he said folks! I am totally verified with coinbase, still 10k max. I'm assuming other exchanges have different max levels or you could at least have 4 diff bank accounts and 4 diff exchanges to work with?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:29:27
But am I using my own information?  or am I using someone else's ID and then transferring to a wallet then bailing?
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:28:52
HAHAHAAH so  he's calling for a fucking boycott and it's his fault, TYPICAL, just like about 99% of the "i lost my money I'm locked out of my account, my coinbase was hacked BS posts"  remember folks idiots are out there and then they might come looking to beg with sob stories.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:08:41
correction, not a crash, Wake up
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:01:22
I bought in at 3k.  I can cash out now and be way up and walk away before it gets totally retarded around here lol
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:54:11
I did not mean to  imply I run a crypto LLC.  My bad.  So no, but I have moved MILLIONS before.  I don't see what the problem is, if the exchange is legit, set up a meeting, move funds.  Have you HAD an issue? OR are you just making one up?
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:08:05
At least I didn't leave my foot locker open with a jelly donut in it!

@_date: 2018-01-10 20:10:42

@_date: 2018-01-01 14:16:13
Exactly, thus the unavoidable.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:26:07
Or I could be lying in order to waste everyone's time!
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:34:47
Been doing it every day this week, pretty fucking easy to make a few hundred here and there with prices this volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:48:54
Some of the angry posts I'm getting say they do believe me lol.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:59:32
Oh well then it doesn't matter does it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:27:52
And on the other hand I've been using coinbase for months solid as a rock no issues at all.  It sucks that he had this issue, but I'm not boycotting something that works for him.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:34:46

@_date: 2018-01-01 15:16:44

@_date: 2018-01-04 04:02:43
Yup.  Won't stop people from using it.  Soon, there will be plenty of giant corporations accepting some form of crypto.  This beast is coming and coming fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:38:00
You think the IRS is funded and staffed well enough to be caring about every idiot on social media who claims to be evading taxes?  Again on paper I barely exist.  What are you going to do?  I'm on linux, behind a VPN using internet that isn't in my name, in a house that isn't in my name.  Exactly how do you even know who I am?  I don't exist :)
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:59:37

Why are you asking. I mean...what?  How could you think this is even remotely real?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:24:14
I keep buying more. I remember saying man I wish it was 10k again!
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:50:23
you told a bunch of bs that was easily disproven......what did you expect lol.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:10:17
I like things that actually have value!  And I like to gamble.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:24:08
I don't know about you but I can only pull out 10k a day on my exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:59:01
Kraken, Gemini and Coinbase are the 3 that I use.  Oh and Binance.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:02:05
I'll hold on to them for you LOL.  No really buy a hardware wallet, I have a Trezor and don't tell anyone in the military that you own coin as it's reason for discharge.  They consider it treason.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:47:35
Is the money you spend on your ATM card, locked away.  Yes it is, in a bank.  So unless you aren't putting your fiat into a bank, then you ALREADY ARE.....

@_date: 2018-01-04 04:12:11
This is why coins like monero exist, for privacy  They can't stop you from taking crypto payments for your stuff.  I mean, I guess they could say that owning crypto is illegal, but how would they know? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:44:39
Probably under investigation by the DEA then....

@_date: 2018-01-18 10:27:28

@_date: 2018-01-01 16:08:24
I cash out profits weekly.  Yup.
Is it MY ID card I'm using on coinbase, no.  Does that stop me? no.
I use half my profits for gold (goldmoney.com) never said shit about the capital gains tax.  
The other half I transfer to a wallet.
Everything is easily verifiable and possible.
Sounds like some jealousy from another fan/stalker if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:53:52
Sounds like a kid here.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:41:43
Nope, because with idiots will come regulation.  Let's keep this for the smart people only, no dummies allowed.

@_date: 2018-01-11 22:07:41

@_date: 2018-01-10 17:06:45

@_date: 2018-01-16 15:08:18

@_date: 2018-01-09 00:18:24
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:00:56
So now that we know exchanges have issues, may I suggest using FIAT to purchase the coin you wanted and not relying on exchanges to be instant and perfect.  This is what I do.  See the new coin I want, buy it with fiat.  If I need to I then cash out the other coin I was going to trade back to fiat.  Then if there is a delay at least it's not effecting my bottom line.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:41:48
bitcoin is freedom of speech, because it's code.  It's already been proven with Napster in the supreme court.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:28:58
yup, it's over, nobody wants crypto anymore.  It's all done.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:46:02
I actually run LLC's.  It's easy.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:54:47
this is why people call it a scam and a bubble when dumb money like this just jumps in all uninformed.  DONT BUY SHIT TILL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! I "pretended" to buy coin for 4 months before using real money...

Copy &amp; pasted to save time. Long but worth the read. Keep your eye on this - it's what we're up against.
Early November it's announced BTC will have two Futures Market. Shortly after the announcement Hedge Fund Managers along with the wealthy elite start buying up BTC by the billions in order to drive price up to ATH (19k) with the knowledge of knowing they would short the 1st BPOE future. First Future Market set at 15k Hedge Fund Managers start laddering sales of their now ATH BTCs making BILLIONS. These large sales slowly create panic and more people start selling. By this time The hedge funds guys are close to cashed out. Market takes a dump and the Hedge Funds Made Billions buying BTC Low and selling high while at the same time NAILING their short call on Future Market. OK GREAT HEIST RIGHT? BUT WAIT THATS NOT ALL.
Hedge Funds Managers and Wealthy Elite go LONG on BCME Future which is due 10 days after the first futures call. Market takes a complete nose dive back to 9k and gues who is their to start buying again? Thats right the Hedge Fund Managers and Wealthy Elite. With their newly made BILLIONS the Hedge Fund Managers push the price back up over course of 7 days in order to hit their LONG CALL on 2nd Futures market. If you see a spike in the price of BTC and overall market cap after 1pm PST today (when 1st future call settles) you will have witnessed one of the greatest robberies of ALL TIME.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:44:52
Yeah just cause you have 15 million on paper doesn't mean any exchange in the world could handle it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:17:50

I have a friend who is a Cayman Island national.  We just travel over there, cash out, store in bank.  Even better, I don't own a single piece of equity or assets in my name.  If you were to audit me and come after me, on paper, I'm the poorest hobo bum you ever met!

@_date: 2018-01-01 13:16:33
You mean, give you more info so you can doxx me?
The key to having what I have is to want less and need even less than that.
I don't have "things" because things you own, end up owning you.
Have a group of friends who act as a "coop" and all work together.  Between my "gang" we provide everything needed for existence on the planet.  Food, water, shelter.
If you don't have anything, they can't threaten to take it away and that my friends, is true freedom.

Are you being dumb on purpose to pretend to make a point?  Are you not aware of the plans for bitcoin?  Might take a bit things are being implemented, that's why people are investing in it.  But go ahead, throw a fit and take your slavery dollars and fuck off then.

@_date: 2017-12-25 00:37:52
Nationalism is a disease.  Politics is the symptom.  And yes you should pay attention to these trends because crypto is pure supply/demand driven.  2018 will end with a clear winner, mark my words.  Let's just hope I can see the wave and ride it before the end.  At this point, I'm gambling with house money.  Invested 400 USD in the beginning and now I'm at 4k after I pulled my initial 400 out.  So if the whole game ends. Who cares.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:28:39
EXACTLY! WTF!?  How can these people here call themselves "investors" and they can't even do basic math problems like this?!
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:10:41
I'm gambling.  I had X amount when I walked into the Casino.  I walk out with at least X amount, maybe Y amount.  Either way I walk out with what I walked in with.  Where's the fallacy?  It's not investing, it's gambling, let's be honest here.  The feds will never allow bitcoin to take over as actual currency and no coin that exists today could possibly handle global adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:08:21
Explain?  I know it's gambling.  I put down some money, I pull that money out at first profit and now I'm playing with profits.  It's not gains or losses until I walk away from the table.  Either way I have what I started with.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:08:10

You are not wrong, but the massive weaponized misinformation machine is attacking that it can't replace "currency" because of long tx times and high tx cost.  That's the points they are attacking and to be honest if they aren't dealt with NOW, bitcoin will end up obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:57:42
Then we have all missed our chance and we should all bail.  At this point the whales own it all and we are just pawns.

Ok, even from coin to fiat?  I'd have to set up a personal transfer to another person, at some point the IRS is gonna want to get invovled.

@_date: 2017-12-30 19:33:25
I don't have to prove shit.  I just call the cops and get a lawyer and press charges and sue you.  Good luck bucko.  If I had 300k in "limbo" I wouldn't be on reddit casually mentioning and complaining about it.  I would have my accountant and lawyers in literal arms at the courthouse!  But whatever man it's obviously theft and illegal and that's why it's regulated and insured, because of possible theft....which is what this is.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:34:03
But I'm assuming I can't use it because I'm USA?  Lemme see whats up

It might.  Poor people are all "good people"   You are basically funding illegal activities and drug use ALONG with the probably minority of them who need actual help.  I'm not a believer in giving it out free, maybe it's because every single penny I have, I had to give literal blood, sweat and tears to get.

@_date: 2017-12-27 06:28:03
Because it's federally regulated and it's a bank, based in USA. There is no way in hell they could legally steal your fiat.  Different exchanges go on and spread FUD so you will use theirs instead and then they can make the fees.  It's very simple.

Cash balances held in your Coinbase accounts belong to you- not Coinbase. 
If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.
Even if Coinbase were to fail as a business, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers

Blah blah blah blah, bye.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:38:18
What is the implication on that btw?  That I couldn't be a new user?  Or that because I never used Reddit before I'm not special enough to be taken seriously?  Is this not a discussion board?  Wtf is wrong with you.  That's ALL you got to discredit me is my account time? lol ok then.

So some big money dude in China is basically "buying" into crypto by attempting to muddle the noobs into pumping up his coin that he knows in the long run won't be useable as he promises?  Fucking supervillian shit right there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:55:01
Why would we, it's a good thing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:36:36
If I'm right, I have legal recourse if they try to steal my money.  It's a risk you take with ANY bank anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:17:30
I mean I've made some money, like around 4k, but that's not "real money" in perspective of things.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:52
Please, I lost all my life savings, and it's xmas please help me.  Cmon.. give me a break.  At least I ruined it and nobody will respond or donate.

Just like in any other gamble I have a strategy that I employ and I don't diverge from it.  But I will from now on take a % out every week and place it in "my" pile.  Your advice probably just made me rich.

LTC when it was at 60.  Saw the curve coming, believed in the tech, then douche bag tells us to prepare for a bear market and sells all HIS shares at ATH.  It's ok I sold out at 330, waiting for the real correction that is coming directly.  Then will buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:18:53
Actually, yes it does.

His money is federally insured by the govt.  Call a lawyer, file the proper paperwork, it's the same illegality as if your bank suddenly stole 300k.  STEALING MONEY IS A CRIME.  I don't have to point the specific law out to prove that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:51:23
I would dare to say the same for you.  Also, why would I care what you think?  Why would you care what I think?  Can we move onto actual conversations now?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:46:54
I'd rather gamble myself rich than invest.  It's all a scam everywhere, corruption runs deep and to me, it's about fucking the federal reserve and those who own America like a corporation.  To me, it's about more than making money, but I HAVE made money.  To me it's about sticking my middle fingers at the IRS, FEDS and wage slavery corporations who are corrupt to the core.  I believe in an idea.   AND I've tripled my life savings.  So meh.  It's not for the weak.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:41:00
At some point, the fiat someone is buying that from me, has had taxes paid on it right?

It only matters what the whales do.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:59:17
So explain, they pump up interest in the coin, while sitting on a ton of them, then at some price point they have pre set, they all sell and the coin price drops to nothing and they walk away with all the cash?  Couldn't every crypto basically be manipulated in the same way?  If you had enough money you could influence the price of the coin simply buy selling and buying correct?  Is my thinking right?  If so, it's ALL a scam then right?

My friend was straight robbed.  I however, took a second, didn't FOMO and looked at other exchanges, by the time I texted him to calm down, he had pushed BUY and now he's cashed out entirely calling "bitcoin a scam"  I have no clue why they would do this, it CAN'T be helping....

FUD.  It's going back up.  If you bought coin just to make a few quick bucks, you are an idiot.  HODL and it's going to be fine. What? Crypto currency is just going to go away tomorrow nobody is gonna talk about it anymore?  It's the holidays, it's the last day of the year and people are cashing out for tax reasons.

Well considering I've already pulled my initial investment plus profit out ( I doubled my money) anything from this point is just a fun game with house money.  It's gambling and I'm good at it.  Don't be mad at me cause I win.

EVERYTHING IS A BUBBLE.  Better learn to play the game or end up working a slave wage job with a shitty boss who makes you come in on the holidays while he stays at home.  But seriously, yes everything is a "game" you either win or lose.  Welcome to life.

*cha ching* cringe that homo
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:37:58
So wait, you invested then panicked at a correction/dip and then sold low.  You realize it wouldn't have been a mistake if you would have just held.  This isn't a day trading game, you have to invest for the long term. 
You only lost cash and value because you sold.  Selling was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Your wife doesn't get it and you would be better off financially without her.

I'm cynical as fuck, I trust nobody and I see reddit as weaponized misinformation and I see every user as a shill or beggar.  I swear I've found less than 1% of posts that discuss technology, the future or any actual facts about coins.  It's all shills and memes.  As a 43 year old man, memes are fucking stupid to me.  They are obvious as fuck and to have a REAL conversation we should steer away from this childish behavior.

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:18:51
Thanks for the heads up.  Guess I'll open an account in a friends name or childs name and use that for legal stuff and use mine for whatever.   That way when they decide to go fascist on me, it doesn't affect my real stash.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:38
After the last crazy 48 hours, I did the same, moved everything to my Trezor and am logging off now, heading to family events and gonna watch movies and play video games.  I'll check it first week of Jan and laugh at how much I've made without having to fuck my holidays up with all the self induced stress.   Historically it always goes back up.  HODL!

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:22:16
Because you are owned by the Federal Reserve like a slave.  If you aren't mad you aren't paying attention.

don't talk about money if you have a lot of it, which is why I feel most discussion here is pure crap because the dudes with MONEY don't talk about it.

Yeah, I'd like to say I would do it, but I think we all know once that cash is in my bank you and I would never speak again.  I would suggest you stop trying to do this because of your location.  It sounds dangerous and illegal.

How did that prediction work out?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:04:57
I'm waiting.  I got coin, calm down.  But the time is now.  2018 is the year of crypto and there will be a clear winner by the end.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:38:33
Then how are they sitting on 100's of thousands of users money?  Wouldn't that be illegal?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:47:51
Dude, it's yours.  If you are telling the truth.  Now tell me what exchange did this?
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:19:51
DO NOT BUY RIPPLE! ITS NOT A REAL CYRPTOCOIN!
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:42
But in the end it's illegal and you are insured.  Ok good.  I never said it would be easy, cheap or fast to sue them, but it IS a crime and it's insured and regulated by the Feds! That was hard to get you to agree to!
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:05:01
yeah tell that to the people paying 32 USD to move 10USD of BTC to a wallet.  Seems like an issue and a good point to talk about, since it's the ONLY point that anyone talks about.  Fuck the shit altcoins.  Pump and dump scams.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:35:34
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:53:22
What I was saying is, that if you aren't investing with the idea that it will eventually replace fiat, then you are literally gambling in a bubble.  Either way enjoy the ride buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:51:21
So you "invested" waited a WEEK then freaked out and sold low.  Wow, proof that some people have lower IQ's.  Thanks for the cheap coin moron.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:47:18
How does this explain why they are sitting on users money?  Are you suggesting this dude is laundering money or involved in illegal activity and that's the reason coinbase is holding his fiat?  I'm confused, what law did you think I was trying to reference?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:21
Unless he just buys the crypto himself, he's borrowing equity against it.  It's borrowing.  Your analogy  has nothing to do with money.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:32:12
and what do you think that number means to the federal reserve?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:37:37
Any pattern you see is pure speculation from your brain.  You cannot and do not know the future.  Good luck to you!

The USA Patriot Act, which requires Coinbase to designate a compliance officer to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, create procedures and controls to ensure compliance, conduct training, and periodically review the compliance program.
Most states’ money transmission laws and corresponding regulations. 
Digital Currency
Coinbase prioritizes the security of our customer's funds, all digital currency that Coinbase holds online is insured. If Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
For more on securing your account, see here.
Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. 
 
Cash Balances
U.S. Customers
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in, custodial bank accounts, or in U.S. Treasuries. 
Non-U.S. Customers
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. 
Cash balances held in your Coinbase accounts belong to you- not Coinbase. 
If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.
Even if Coinbase were to fail as a business, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers.
You could feel the mic drop from here.  Now fuck off.

DID YOU JUST SAY RIPPLE HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHH now we know it's fud
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:17:12
And hundreds aren't.  I would say user error on the ones that are.  They probably don't have valid id's or fucked up in some other way.  Coinbase is fine, regulated and subject to US law.  It's a BANK.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:29:41
Just read my history before embarrassing yourself further.  I'm doing just fine, thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:13:27
It's my time to waste and I guess it's your money to waste on uneducated uniformed gambling/investments.  Enjoy buying high and selling low.  :O

I always wonder how many of these "pity me" posts get DM's with donations.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:28:52
Why would you put this much effort into a lie?  I'll answer, MONEY.  There are the usual suspects involved in this now that it's "real"  Expect FUD and FOMO news primarily on reddit.  It's WEAPONIZED MISINFORMATION for the end goal of profit.  Take that as you will, realize big money is pushing different coin, ride the wave with them but be careful, they usually win.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:04:32
I've been reading and reading and reading and reading for months now.  I suggest you start that journey.  A LOT of the information on reddit is literally weaponized shill manipulation or amateurs who you should ignore.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:40:14
.....nice mental gymnastics.  I can't argue with stupid, so I won't even try.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:18:15
Thanks, interesting, but it's hard to shake the fact that I play it like a game and consider my invested money gone.  I was happy to pull my initial out.  But maybe I'll start pulling some out and calling it mine now and then and create another pile.  Thanks for the information and not talking down to me like some redditor.

I feel like a monkey might fly out of my butt.  Our feelings are not important. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:45:25
It's FDIC insured.  I can prove I paid for the coin with my bank transactions.  It's a pretty shut and done case.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:00:20
I only drink whiskey and beer!  
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:40
It's about to be implemented in Amazon, Ebay and they just started trading futures....it's not going anywhere.  FUD, shill crap again yall. If you can't even provide any metrics to prove your opinion, it's just spray paint on the wall.

I wish I could give you more than one upvote
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:44:53
Proving this is a FUD attack by BCash and it's chinese backers.  They are confusing people on purpose in order to pump their coin.  Worst thing?  It might work.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:29:27
RIGHT!? I'm in the same boat, but just because it's "free" money doesn't mean I gotta spend it like a retard! I reinvested it and made my position better. but whatever makes you happy....?  You should have just converted to fiat and gave gifts and kept more assets imho
