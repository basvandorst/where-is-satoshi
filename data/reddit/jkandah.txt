True.  However any reasonable time frame 1d,1w,1y,10y the USD does an OK job at.

What's Bitpay's strategy for mass merchant adoption? It seems that selling deals here and there won't scale to move all merchants into Bitcoin.
Also, what types of recommendations is Bitpay suggesting for companies to hold Bitcoin? I realize they can instantly convert it but it is better for the currency for them to hold and use it instead.

There will be a public site put up this week. Feel free to message me if you want further follow-up

Armory is a great solution. Look at their offline feature.

Somehow someone did get access to my API key but I'm not entirely sure how.

Have you tried the live alphas? I used them months ago and they're interface looks awesome and worked perfectly. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:36:55
Are there any remittance sites that hedge currency risks for a certain period? Seems like that would be a great business model.

Shawn and the rest of the team have done a great job and I look forward to the project development.

Can anyone find the transaction?
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:29:26
To be completely fair the amount was publicly stated.  Wouldn't it be nice to have "proof of payment in btc".  If you were bitpay you could show it to us here.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:25:03
I think his point is very fair though.  When you compare Bitcoin to USD it isn't a good store of wealth because of volatility.  With Bitcoin, I'm able to lose half of my store of wealth in a week if I transact at highs and lows.  This isn't possible with USD.
I think he implies that when volatility decreases it will become a store of wealth.

I know super3, Shawn Wilkinson who has provided code for Bitcoin Core.  He's outrageously talented and has put a lot of effort into this project.  I'm very excited to see them progress and I have backed this project.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:02:24
Thanks for the note.  This is definitely a hard project and it will require a lot of work and time.  It may not be possible but I think there could be a lot of positive benefits that could help build and scale Tor overtime.  We're definitely evaluating all of this and are looking for help from individuals that would like to contribute.  The presentation was a short pitch which just talked about the general idea it is far from anything close to being done.  Right now a technical paper is being written about the concept and laying out the issues at hand.
Once that paper reaches a decent state it will be shown around the community/mailing list and asked for expert opinions.  
If you're interested in following or getting involved or have more thoughts please feel free to send me an email: jeremy

It's a server that is running custom software that interacts with the API key. I have a dedicated IP address.

@_date: 2014-01-14 21:49:41
Well now it's limiting the API usage to my IP address so not useless

What is the revenue vs ghash.  Is ghash just easier? I saw some analysis but it didn't see conclusive.
@_date: 2014-07-15 02:21:37
^ this
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:45:05
Well the API key was enabled yet I don't know how it would have been compromised. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:10:45
Nothing very public right now.  It's a difficult problem and there's a lot of moving parts.  As the project progresses we'll write about what's going on.

TLDR Factom scales the block chain to be used as a storage of hashes which lets you audit systems and prove storage.
Anyone who is storing data that you need to trust can use this to make their data irreversible and trustable.

Couldn't I be my friend.  Then, go make large purchases I planned to anyways at a large discount?  Didn't look into it much but limits would probably slow this down.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:54:36
That's the purpose of this account. To use that API basically. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:09:22
I think it is safe to say that Bitcoin will be on there next.  Will be fun to see the next fastest technology after that.

With Realcoin you can trade from BTC to USD without a bank account.  You can literally hold USD digitally without a bank.  The caveat being that some custodian will hold your USD.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:32:50
What is a gold coin anyways? Just a classification for something? Can I do anything with it or sell it?
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:22:10
Andreas is one of the best public voices for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:01:16
The price of bitcoin is irrelevant for businesses that decide to use bitpay and not actually even touch bitcoins.
So, the market cap of bitcoin doesn't really change the value of the network that companies like that.
Basically, the market cap of bitcoin doesn't change it's value in use at all.

We've been working to get a project started that has approval of the Tor Project. Sometimes things move a little slow but what we are talking about is being worked on. If you have interest send me a PM.

Great.  If you do this, I would recommend creating an account and using your referral code.

Perhaps someone has already compiled this but I'd definitely like to see a list of all the good opposing viewpoints.  I know we have the common myths on the wiki but is there anything like this out there?
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:11:59
In business you evaluate risk and reward. The risk here is paying salaries for a couple of people to integrate a payment platform. The reward is pretty high. Free advertising and getting the bitcoin community to love you. I don't see a lot of negatives here. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:49:44
Thanks for the comment. However for bitcoin to be a great worldwide currency innovation cannot be limited to the US.

To the first question: It is very easy for a government to ban cryptocurrencies.
The real question is: Will it be able to stop their citizens from using these currencies.  It looks like China has put some serious breaks on their citizens use of the currency.  Ultimately people will use black-markets and other means if the risk of doing that is greater than the cost.  I would imagine living in China, not having access to a bank account and not trusting the government it might be worth taking this risk.
The worst part of governments 'banning' the currency is that it basically pulls their country out of the innovation side of the currency.  Which would be a tragedy.  Imagine if the internet was illegal when it first launched in the US.  A lot of businesses and innovation would have been exported to other countries.

I think he's trying to be the anti-Bitcoin guy so when/if it fails he was the right one who was telling us to stay away.  It's not a bad bet but just on the wrong side IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:33:40
Gigaom published a follow up as they are on the same news network. They failed to mention that bitcoin made the year of 2013. Honestly 2014 will be the year of bitcoin. It will be the first headline one year from now. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:07:19
Using bitcoin makes it valuable. It doesn't matter how you are using the technology. The fact that you use it makes the tech do something for overstock. 
As for currency risk. A business shouldn't carry that risk and should divest it to their shareholders who can take that risk themselves as it is not in the core business model of overstock to bet on currency values. It's the exact same as a us company holding euros. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:38:52
No worries.  We're really not trying to 'advertise' here.  I'm excited about bitcoin and that's the motivation.  If you'd like to chat me on the product send me a DM or drop me an email to jeremy

It's the New York Times one of the most popular news sites in the world.  I'd appreciate that they would not have grammatical errors.  What if they called the iPhone the Iphone?

Hey Mike, thanks -- we just dropped it in *silently* over the weekend.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:29:57
I completely understand.  As for iOS &gt; We don't have any options not to use that technology.  The Profile that installs simply gives us the identifier of the device.  No software is installed and no settings are modified.  We're working in a space where people are trying to push us out.  So very similar to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:13:18
Just another follow up on this.  Most of the reason that our iOS experience has so much friction is due to apple.  We have to have that friction to make our app work on their platform.  On Android there is no friction and you can start using the app much easier.
I mention this because apple is taking a pretty tough stance on bitcoin right now and I think that it's important to point out.

A typical offer pays out between $.05 - $.25 with some offers paying out more.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:51:27
Similar not the same.  I can go to almost any merchant in the US and instantly pay them with a credit card.
The difference is that Bitcoin allows us to pay between any two parties not just the ones that credit card companies allow.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:28:24
Ok here we go:
-He uses "BitCoin" instead of Bitcoin or bitcoins
-He doesn't understand how Bitcoin could be "a terrific medium of exchange".  I think that's a tough thing to not understand that I can send money to anyone in the world instantly.

You can't remove an app install they are a first time only to the device type of transaction. Glad you're happy with the service.

He lost a lot of credibility when he states "but when I try to get them to explain to me why BitCoin is a reliable store of value, they always seem to come back with explanations about how it’s a terrific medium of exchange. Even if I buy this (which I don’t, entirely), it doesn’t solve my problem."
He doesn't even understand that it is a better medium of exchange anything out there.  That's not a theory, it is a fact.
