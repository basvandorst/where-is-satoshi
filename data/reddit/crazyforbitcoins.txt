You are right but the mis-allocation of capital caused by (all installments of QE) a QE 4 would not be good for bitcoin. It would only prop up the economy higher and making it crash harder later on. The pain (debt) caused by QE is just further being kicked down the road. When people don't feel that pain (debt) they are less likely to do anything about it. More QE will increase the time people wait to get into bitcoin. It will make people whateverish when it comes to accepting bitcoin. 
It is like having an wound but not feeling the pain because you numb it with alcohol. When you run out of or give up on alcohol, you finally realize how much it hurts and go to the hospital. 
QE4 is not good news for bitcoin.

Ya, but that is pretty far off and then you have to think about how to make that into a easy and seemless experience for the mainstream consumer. 
They might solve this and be a better solution but it will be down the line.

I get that, why would having paid miners dedicating their hashing power to mining your transactions not make the process faster?
That is what I don't get and what nobody has told me why that wouldn't work. 
Maybe not instantly, but why wouldn't what I purposed make the process faster.

Another reason why the deep web is the only pure Bitcoin economy. 
These Mit people don't have nothing on the ol' digital drug trade when it comes to a bitcoin economy.

"confirmations come later" I am trying to figure out how to get them to come faster.

Yes, I think that time is coming. The age of bitcoin adoption by merchants is here. Not just are big merchants accepting bitcoin but the payment processing space is heating up. New players are entering the market - SnapCard, GoCoin, etc. and they exprencing a lot of success. 
It doesn't have to be instantly, just (much) faster than 10 minutes.

Thanks for telling me about Green Address. I did not know about Green Address. I checked out their  and it seems that Green Address just weighs the risk of the transaction and puts their reputation behind. They don't seem to actually confirm the transaction, just put their name behind it. That is innovative and helpful. It is also interesting, but why hasn't merchant processors adopted this. It seems like a solution to sending transactions for certain transactions but not something that can scale.   
Do they allow you to instantly receive transactions? (Even if the person sending funds to you is not using instant green address)
Also, you said they do it was cheaper. Does Green Address charge for this service? How much?

They can't fix it. There is too much debt. It is impossible. 
What I am saying is that they pushing off the end date of their ponzi scheme farther down the line. This will numb the growth of bitcoin and it will be much less than if they didn't. Of course, when hyperinflation hits demands will soar for bitcoin but likely those people running from hyperinflation into bitcoin will buy for a large market and they will have a very hard time getting in. Why is someone going to want to sell their bitcoins for hyperinflated US dollars while their bitcoins are going theough the roof becasue of this. Instead of new people entering bitcoin, the wealth is going to be transfered to the existing holders of bitcoin
