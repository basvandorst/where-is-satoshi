Can I also sell on Aamagi metals and get Bitcoin back?
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:19:06
In order to accomplish this I would need each client to sign transaction privately on client side using Java script.
I noticed that there are a few multisig supporting js libraries:
- 
- 
- 
-  
...and at least 2 more
Which one is recommended?

Basically, I look at it as opening a savings account. Money placed in Bitcoin is long run, i.e: I tell my friends, buy 10 coins and only start to use them 5-6+ years for now (say from 2020 onwards), and also, when you do spend them, treat it like your savings account and not your checking account (or day to day spending account). 
My question was asked in this perspective. Wasn't asked assuming bought Bitcoin would be spent in 2017 or anytime before 2020.

am not sure they will let a crash occur. I think they are able to hide the problems under the rag for a bit longer than expected. dont forget they will lose everything in a crash so who knows if it will ever happen the way most people telling those prophecies think.

I take this as a joke. Crypto is clever money. The only way to win bitcoin is by introducing a much largely adopted rival crypto currency and within the next five years.

Yes.

@_date: 2014-11-05 10:19:19


I see your point, but I am telling them to take a small amount of 3000 USD (by saying small I mean, an amount that wouldn't effect your life if you lose it all-together) and put aside till 2020. I don't think they will be pissed by this advice whatever the outcome is.
See above, my question was asked in this perspective. Wasn't asked assuming bought Bitcoin would be spent in 2017 or anytime before 2020.
I see your point saying needing 2941 coins to have a million USD in current prices, but I am eventually asking while looking long term, assuming bought bitcoins are secured for 6+ years, till 2020 or so. Placed on a Paper wallet inside a safe deposit box.

Good time to switch to bitcoin. Price is near year low. If you don't have any, I would put 50% of what you want to invest in total at the current price range
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:27:47
Yes. You are over thinking it. I think you can have them use coinbase and do a transfer to your account. Then you can do whatever you want to transfer parts of it to your own wallet so not to make a mistake.

Was saying "if". Meant to say that maybe it's best to stay out while the uncertainty is there and then miss on the high returns, and join in when there is more certainty and still enjoy not too bad returns.
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:44:42
look at the increase in the number of wallets, new services like coinbase, circle, coinapult locks and bitreserve etc, all these were not here in 2013, you could not even imagine in 2013 to be able to buy bitcoin using a credit card. Check out the figures in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, about x8 folds in a year and a half.
Now you tell me is bitcoin doomed? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:30:07
Didn't say Crypto is going to kill banks. I am sure they will be here in 50 years. Most people need someone to take responsibility of their funds. Including myself.
@_date: 2014-11-18 06:47:28
About 20%. As price is relatively low for the year I will buy in 3 separate events in the coming 30 to 60 days
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:36:29
It can be operational in ten years from now. There are "dead" Internet services still operational today. Even if there is a bug it can be fixed and still be operational. But if within six years (we are not talking short term here) it isn't as x10 bigger in market cap then it probably lost to another Crypto. And by saying x10 I am being really pessimistic. The real figure should be x50 or x100 at least for it to be successful.

I'd say it would take another year for people to grasp it. As soon as the bankers, the rich etc will pump it on their own controlled media channels (after they had bought it themselves) every John Doe will go buy some.

Use this function to create a nonce.
def get_unique_nonce():

make sure you do the below, i.e: add nonce to list of params:

    params.update({"nonce": nonce}) 
    params_encoded = urllib.urlencode(params)
