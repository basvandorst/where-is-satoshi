How you suppose to hack the keys? If you are trying forcing random tipping until get a valid crypto key, you need to do a transaction, and to do a transaction you need to pay a fee, and you can only discovery if it is a correct key if the blockchain check the transaction, and it take a long time to do one transaction, so its impossible to crack keys like that, you cant put 2\^234823 transactions at the same time in the network.

You can transform btc as a credit btc with apps if btc start to be use more frequent. We already have bit pay, I. E., to facilitate the buys and sells. Btc can be used like a cash, just need more people using it, maybe in some years we will see that.

This will not happen, because when we have quantum computing doing that, we will have miners with quantum computing improving the security of the network too. miners hardware always follow the tech. When bitcoin have launched, the miners are 100 times or more slower than it is now, and it continue improving, because when you mine, you receive bitcoins too, so, with powerful quantum miner, you will be able to mine more bitcoins and improve more the network at the same time. The only way to broke this network is if any large companie invest bilions to have more powerful hardware than the miners have, nowadays its billions and billions, and in the future it will be more yet.  
The problem of bitcoin is more about the speed of transactions, it doesnt work in our real world, maybe like a gold only, but for all day usage we have best alternatives like litecoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, dash, monero... And maybe, and probably, some alternative cripto takes the leader of the market and became more valuable than bitcoin today.

Actualy... Telling people you buy bitcoin increase the interesest about bitcoin, and if he does anyone to buy bitcoin too you will increase the bitcoin price, because more people will understand the bitcoin and buy bitcoin, this will be good for all. Bitcoin isnt a thing to hide... Off course you dont want to tell people all money you have, but if you just say you buy some bitcoin, its fine.
