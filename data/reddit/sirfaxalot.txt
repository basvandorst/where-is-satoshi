Can't you just view your wallet's address(es) via  to confirm your holdings without downloading the blockchain?

Please be more specific.

I had an outstanding $1000 buy order.  I knew leaving it in there was a risk, but I chose to do it anyway knowing I could take the loss if necessary.  It's still fucking shitty that this happened though and now following all the aftermath/suits is going to be a depressing pain in the ass.  It especially irks me when I think about how many pizzas $1000 could have bought me and how I could be eating one right now.

"post scarcity"... because there is a way to make material something other than finite?
@_date: 2012-07-30 18:00:47
I don't doubt it, but how do you know this?

I think the community needs to be more focused on promoting and using bitcoin than holding onto it for investment purposes.  If 95% of people are using it as an investment, there's not much stopping it from collapsing in price.
@_date: 2012-07-12 00:01:24
I must be dumb.  Why does the legalization of bitcoin make the price skyrocket?

You don't have to be a Chase customer to deposit money on Bitfloor.  Bitfloor simply has a Chase account and you can deposit cash directly into it by walking into any Chase and forking over the cash; you don't have to be a customer.  Just hold onto the receipt and then email a copy of it to Bitfloor afterward.

@_date: 2012-08-21 22:49:15
So how much BTC and USD has pirate ran away with?
@_date: 2012-07-12 05:36:03
Walk into any Chase bank and make a cash deposit into Bitfloor's account.  Your funds will show up online within 24 hours and you can place a buy order to obtain your bitcoins.  Go to Bitfloor.com for more info.

Current statistical analysis pegs it at $13.44 by August 23rd.  I will sell you all my coins for $10 right now.
@_date: 2012-07-17 02:09:49
This screams "bubble" to me.  If I was holding onto a mountain of bitcoins since the earlier days, this would mark my opportunity (assuming I missed the first bubble) to sell the farm and make out like a bandit before it's too late.  I bet there is a massive sell off in the coming weeks if not days and the price goes on a bit of a roller-coaster ride before resuming a slow and steady climb.  And seeing as how I've also joined the buying bandwagon yesterday and today, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that the roller-coaster mellows out above $8.50.
@_date: 2012-08-20 14:04:35
What leads you to believe that there's a Phase II?
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:24:11
It was at 20 a month ago.  Do you really think the bitcoin economy has matured more than double in a month? The currency has been around for over 4 years... this jump in price seems very unjustified.  There's no definite metric here though so at the end of the day, we're all mostly speculating, guessing, hoping, feeling, etc..

Where is the option on gox to cancel a withdrawal?
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:49:52
What about burning CDs to transfer the transaction files?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:40:10
Anyone else believe that the value of a bitcoin is ultimately tied to how useful it currently is?

You might want to consider using a deterministic wallet through armory or another client so you don't have to repeatedly create backups.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:59:44
Armory deterministic wallets, Truecrypt, Linux, dedicated laptop for offline transactions, full disk encryption, paper backups divided and scattered in multiple locations... these are your friends.
@_date: 2013-07-16 13:18:14
No... gox just has the most trading volume through some glitch in the matrix.  Duh.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:52:27
Agreed.  In the midst of all the confused oh-my-god-is-it-a-bubble-or-not speak, there was that day last week where Gox was DDOS'd and BitInstant got hacked.  Yet, the next day nothing had changed pricewise.  There is resilience I think.
Edit: Oh yea and that blockchain fork... what a doosey that was.  Yet, here we are knocking on $200.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:31:13


I occasionally use the phrase "cash out," but in my mind I'm cashing out to attain land or some other hard asset.  And I think it's fair to use this term because bitcoin is still experimental; it may yet fail and become a footnote in the history of cryptocurrency.  I still think that cryptocurrency in some form will save humanity though.
@_date: 2013-07-04 16:27:56
Sounds to me like a press release without any real content again.  Still have a significant delay, interface hasn't changed, no mention of litecoin, and trading proceeds as usual... it could be the case that two weeks was up and gox just needed to save face here.
I'm not putting any money in their exchange until we have something of substance to trust over the long term.  This smells to me like another delay tactic.

According to the Armory developer, the answer to this question is "yes".
Though, please remember that if you encrypted the digital backup, then you'll obviously have to remember the encryption password or you've lost all your coins.  The paper backup is unencrypted by design, so that's the key difference here.
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:48:24
but... you can't tell if it's one person or a lot of people at 110

the OP and i are both using 2FA and have fallen victim to this apparent attack.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:54:50
I found it:
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:14:36
It's people like you who have made me a small fortune.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Keep spreading the blind faith!
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:44:00
i am in the same boat.  got an email out of nowhere last night.  now i can't log into my account.  this means that someone else has successfully changed my pw.  and if that's the case, it means that my entire balance is wiped out.  i had 2FA on all actions and a separate linux machine to manage only my gox account.  further, nobody has logged into my email account except me.

Americans correctly place value in dollars because they are a shield against IRS agents raiding your house and killing your dog, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:39:28
All you need to read is OP's line: "I've never been so hyped for Bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-07-10 23:47:24
Bitcoin jumps $5 in price as everyone tries to game each other to get rich! What could possibly go wrong!

Manipulating via bitstamp is not a thing that will work just yet.
@_date: 2013-07-14 02:25:30
This exact situation is happening to me today, too. I also have a significant balance and cannot access it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:57:56
If the buyer now turns around and flips the car for fiat, does he have to pay any tax on the money he earned from the sale?
If not, couldn't he throw the fiat into his checking account and effectively avoid the capital gains on his bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:15:20
I'm not really sure how what the author is saying actually matters.
@_date: 2013-07-13 21:18:09
OP and i have the same theory.  somehow our usernames were acquired and put into the "reset password" form.  then the attacker somehow intercepted the outgoing email from gox to my account.  i say this because according to my log files, nobody else has accessed my email but me.  once the attacker had the email, they clicked on the reset password link and reset my pw.  however, i dont know what they will be able to accomplish inside my account because 2FA is applied to every available action.
what is also concerning here is that the reset password form appears to be broken for gox.  i created a new account just for testing purposes and the reset pw form is not working - it won't let you proceed past the "paste the confirmation code from your email here" form.
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:00:09
It's the same people trading coins back and forth... there is nothing new here.  The 'demand' is just from traders trying to get rich quick.  Some of them will, most of them won't.  Don't pretend like suddenly people realize they need bitcoins for something.
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:38:15
There was a dip?  Not until it gets back to $15 will I consider buying more... shit has seemed a bit out of control for more than a week to me.
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:11:04
What's 
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:54:21
I found the answer by using this:
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:12:09
Yea, you're where I was yesterday.  Start reading or risk losing your coins despite your backup.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:41:08
I dunno man.  i see comments like this and a red flag goes up - the crazies have arrived and delusions are abound; this is the time to flee.  we'll see though.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:19:40
Does the "Make Digital Backup" feature in Armory backup your seed like the paper backup does?
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:17:56
I keep reading about how people think the price will never get back to $20 or never get back to $25 or whatever.  And when I hear this stuff, I translate it in my head to read: "Even though Bitcoin has been around for 4 years, there's no way the price could withdrawal to where it was only a month ago."  And when you put it that way, the statement seems kind of foolish to me.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:09:09
People left the market because gox was getting scary.  Then gox put out a press release saying that "oh just kidding, everything's fine."  People believed them without question.  Then everyone came back into the market.  This 'demand' is just the same people coming back to play the game again.

Suppose your browser is infected with an extension that can view the contents of your gmail account when you log in.  If this is the case, then the attacker's IP address will never appear in your gmail logs, but he still will be able to get the password reset confirmation code.
@_date: 2013-07-13 23:41:39
Yes, I have this and still I am victim of this apparent attack.  It's a linux machine with the latest updates.
@_date: 2013-07-28 16:30:41
Yea, I feel sorry for them, too.  I mean, they only have realized a gain of hundreds of thousands of dollars by doing no work... poor guys.

Is it just me or did everyone else read "In a world where..." in the standard movie trailer voice?

@_date: 2013-07-12 17:28:51
nice try, but few months ago the price was at $20.
