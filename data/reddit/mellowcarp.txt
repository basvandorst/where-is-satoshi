It's been a while but players can exchange Lindin between each other correct? Are they really exempt from this?

Very informative thank you.

Keenly interested in this topic, but not big on tying my poll responses to my facebook presence.  (This one is benign of course, but really don't care to help someone monetize my presence any more than is already occurring by profiling my poll responses.)  That is, unless someone starts sending me a check.  ;)
Rant aside, I'll just go ahead and state my opinion here:  I think it has a damn good chance due to market need, decentralization, and very smart design.

I'm no trading expert so forgive me if this is a dumb question: arbitrage bots would be a good thing right?  (By normalizing prices?)

Admittedly very general just for discussion, but from personal experience. 
Interchange = card brand + issuer = ~2% 
Acquiring Side = .7% (anything really but 2.7% is a common low risk ecommerce rate)
Open to criticism if you think I'm off.

Truly amazing. Wild west.

Probably to others that have been following bitcoin or have subscribed to the subreddit and know you.  Didn't want to assume from one post.  Disposition noted.

Well there is one thing that is interesting:  Let's assume a standard rate of 2.7% for standard internet CC transactions. Of that 2% roughly goes to the issuing bank and card brand and let's say on average another .4 goes to the "acquiring" bank. That leaves .3 for the "value added" provider (in theory) and source of the sale.
If 2.4% of that transaction cost is for "infrastructure" unnecessary for a bit coin transaction, there might be just enough in it for the front end innovators in comparison to the traditional bank card space. 
A lot of broad assumptions in there, but that is the math I am currently doing personally.

Sorry if this is a rookie question I'm a little new to the bitcoin thing but very interested and learning daily:
Isn't this fund just like any other investment vehicle and subject to regulatory control?  Or are bitcoins "worthless assets" or something in the view of the law?  (Talking USA here.)
Pretty interesting stuff.

Anything else I'm missing?

Who are the regulators?  What is the most common form of regulation that causes accounts to freeze on mtgox?  Does it have to do with the transfer of common currencies in and out?

I think this would break their economic model.  What would be their incentive to support?  
I should say I'm new to bitcoin but aggressively working to wrap my head around it.  Maybe I'm not seeing something.

So what is your proposal for a solution?  Government regulation or something else?  Wouldn't a competitive exchange solving the problems you point out be the best solution?  Or are you down on the whole bitcoin concept?  (Honest question.)
