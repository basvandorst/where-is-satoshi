Status msg from the 23/12:
Dear user,
You may be experiencing the slow credit of your bitcoins these days and we would like to take chance to keep you feel released by below knowledge:
There are too many pending transactions waiting for confirmations these days and some holders want their transactions get confirmed faster by paying higher mining fee or extra accelerating payment while hashnest keeps low and fixed mining fee. That is the reason your withdrawal will be confirmed slower.
Another situation, you may even not find your transaction in blockchain, that means blockchain doesn't have enough size for more transactions at the moment. When blockchain has enough size so that it can accept more transactions there, then you may find your transaction id in blockchain, waiting for confirmations until you receive your bitcoins.
You can rest assure that all your withdrawals from hashnest is very safe only you need to make sure the withdraw address is correct!
Our tech team is positively resolving the case these days, and we hope you can get your bitcoins soon.
Besides, you may receive late reply from our support due to high volume customer requests these days. We sincerely apologize for the delay and CS team will keep replying to you.

I got in early on and started buying cheap mining power, then used compound interest to get to the level where I am at today with weekly withdrawals to my wallet. It’s a long time since I got my initial investment back in my bank account. Now it’s just a way to earn btc on a daily basis. 
If power was not so damn expensive in my country I would gladly have bought my own mining hardware and contributed to the network the “right” way but it’s simply not profitable (at least in the past before the price went bonanza). 
I will survive just fine being a victim.

Bitstamp - customer service at Coinbase seems to be non existing these days, tried to contact them a few times in the past and all I all was automated replies

False and politically correct statements as I have personally done this in the past (although nothing like the amount mentioned in the news segment). The guy properly also moved to CH for different reason, hint hint

I also have a small pending transaction that has been sitting there for the last week with zero confirmations. There was however a notification in their app on this issue but I can’t fully see the text, the info seems only to be available if you log into their website on a desktop, and I dont have one here at the moment. So I will give it a look later tonight and hopefully get some clarification. 
My guess is that the increase in btc transactions over the past months and the increase in the mining fees per transaction (I believe hashnest kept their fee at around 60 sat/B while the preferred fee for a faster confirmation of a transaction is 300-400 sat/B) is causing some issues for them. Low fees will eventually push the unconfirmed transaction deeper into the mem pool. 
In their app you are able to follow your transaction on the block chain by clicking the arrow logo in the top right in the “Withdraws” menu and then click your transaction. That should take you to the relevant info on the blockchain and your transaction.
I haven’t seen 7 days of delay before when it comes to payouts.

I disagree - I have made plenty of profit. And btw assuming that I haven’t bought btc and eth as a simple hodler would do a year ago, simply because I have been using a cloud mining service.. haha..well that’s an amazing assumption on your part. 
If there are any fellow miners in this space I’d love to hear from them in this thread.

I think you are dead right on the last sentence :D

Strange. Did you try to force an update by sliding the screen downward? I experience that the app need a little “kick” from time to time to actually update. 
Most likely it could be due to Christmas. Last time I wrote their support they answered within 1.5 day. Their 2FA was broken and never sent the code to my cell. Response was fast in the following messages as well.

Same experience in my workspace, only I decided to tell people 80% of the truth so they know what is up and why I talk about crypto coins all damn the time, however the girls do say that I talk in riddles (fair enough), but the boys seem interested and also see the potential. 
I  bought a substantial amount of both btc and eth a year ago. Of course it all depends on the people and the workplace but I spend so much time with these people that I would feel weird not telling them about this great thing in my life.

Will hodl until $25k then sell a limited portion and I won't use Coinbase :D

Maybe some of the sites out there are scams but HashNest has been up and running with minimal problems over the past three years and it has served me well over the past year or so.
