The Fork is the one where code changes, so BTC forked from the original Bitcoin (BCH)

What do you mean?

It’s not a hostile take-over. The original Bitcoin is the Fork which most closely follows the original code.

Bitcoin supply can increase. Miners would agree to it.

That’s the same argument people had against previous forks

It’s a political discussion the same as Fiat currency

Master of cryptography doesn’t do things by accident.
He added two extra zeroes to the Genesis block.
00 000 00000
2, 3(5) and 5 Zeroes
666 is the Devil (Bankers) number. 999 inverts it.

Buy when everyone else is selling

Technically money laundering is supposed to make it look like you earned the money from something other than selling drugs (c.f. Walter White’s car wash).
In Canada they apparently launder money by making it look like the profits came from... drug sales?
