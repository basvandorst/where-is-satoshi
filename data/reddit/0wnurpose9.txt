It seems to me that interest in Bitcoin is growing every day! This is noticeable by the way people write comments, by the way new news appears, etc.

I think nothing will happen. Why should they stop doing this? There is no logic in it.

Seriously, I have a suggestion that you do not need to make hasty actions. The market is too volatile. I believe that now you just need to keep at least another year. In early 2020, it will be clear what to do next

Maybe, but it seems to me that China has more opportunities in this than in other countries. I mean that it is easier for China to do this than for others.

So funny, white color looks like an unfashionable hairstyle of the 2000s

Brilliant question

Yes, now it can be done. When the price will rise, it will be senseless. If the price is reasonable, I will buy later too

Haha I like this image, very clearly conveys the situation 10 years ago, when most people didn't understand what it was. For example, all my friends thought it was some kind of illegal Internet currency for making illegal transactions or something like that.

But why do I do this? I think it's better to spend time not on drawing the code by hand, but to use it more productively.

Just saw a similar post about the car in another large sub. I have a feeling that this is either a fake or the truth that someone has purposefully posted in order to stir up people's interest in Bitcoin.
But in any case, I'm very happy for you!

Bitcoin is growing, I think that by the end of the week the price will rise to 5500, if not more. The market has changed its direction to the opposite of what happened last year, and it's a fact.

Why do you think that it's possible to lose using this?
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:16:53
Seriously? Who cares about this?
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:19:26
Haha true
