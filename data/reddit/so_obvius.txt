is this in reference to bitfinex? because if it is, Users didn't keep funds on bitfinex because they don't have hardware wallets. They kept funds on that site because they traded daily or wanted to enter and exit the market.

distraction of some crazy college kids with angst acting out so everyone forgets the other crazy shit being said and done daily that affects the whole country.
The far right couldn't find anything to complain about when millions marched during the womens march because nobody acted out. (oh, they tried to make an issue out of the signs left behind, that's how desperate they have become for something they can point to)
 The right looks for stuff like this in the news to justify themselves and try to take some moral high ground.
The worst thing the left could do to the right is follow the womens march example. Being respectful would piss them off.

using the word deplorable is unforgivable, but saying crazy shit every other day that hurts groups of people and individuals and never apologizing, only deflecting, is perfectly fine.
You see the right made a HUGE issue out of the word deplorable, yet the left had a buffet of deplorable shit said on the other side, too much crazy to focus in on, so the point was never driven home of how crazy and wrong it was on any single thing said, they could only move onto the next piece of crazy and try to bring attention to it like the right did with the one word deplorable.

isn't their luck involved? I have this conspiracy theory that the major miners don't want people to solo mine because their is luck involved and if there is thousands of solo miners mining they could get lucky and solve blocks without much power. So they started the its pointless to solo mine argument.

this is so very wealthy individuals can control the market and price of bitcoin. The more money they have the more they can borrow to screw over the little guy. Little guys cannot borrow to compete with wealthy individuals, wealthy individuals can borrow to become super rich investors and crash or moon price as they please. It seems like it will have the opposite effect of what is intended.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:48:49
I guess this means I better sell.

it's the conservative right's gimmick to use patriotism as a backdrop to cover up the bull shit that comes out their mouths. Like fox news does and shitty country music stars  falling off the charts. They add more bald eagles to get a boost in sales and ratings. Because who the fuck is going to disagree with that? It's why nearly every conservative you come across on social media all have the same profile. It seems like the more wrong they are the more they invoke nationalism. 
They can say whatever they want as long as they thank our brave men and women.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:55:44
Don't worry it's only for very wealthy individuals to borrow more money so they can scare you out of spot trading and investing what little you have ever again.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:52:51
it looks like they left it open for a few users because price is moving.

I'm saying replace-by-fee is not what it is cracked up to be and people going around saying this is a fix to stuck transactions that already have good enough fees probably have never used it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:09:46
meh old news, won't happen.
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:07:32
It will probably confirm after a few days if you used a 0.0002 fee (around average). The mempool is massive right now. Over 70,000 transactions stuck.  I have a few stuck myself. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:49:16
replace-by-fee is bullshit. I've spent from 0.001  to 0.002 on multiple transactions and It has never sped up a transaction for me using bitcoin wallet on android. I repeat it has never worked as advertised for me. Using it is flushing money down the toilet.
 I Actually had multiple transactions on different wallets and one of them I didn't use replace by fee and  and it confirmed about the same time as the replace by fee transactions. It is a fucking rip off.

This is true, Democrats only had a short amount of time to pass what they wanted before republicans gained enough control in the other branches. But even when they had that window they had to deal with democrats from red states that were up for reelection and didn't want to pass anything that would cost them their seats.
Sadly, Republicans will have no checks and balances like Democrats did because they now control every branch by a large margin. They won't have to work together with democrats.

This could be a reason 
JP CEO has said negative things about bitcoin in the past.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:33:36
Down vote me if you want, but Bitcoin users want gold bugs interested in bitcoin and they say things like "bitcoin is better than gold or comparable to gold" and name off the reasons, but you could say the same about alt coins users naming off the reason their coin is better than bitcoin. Difference is, cheap synthesis of gold is not possible at the current time; whereas the code behind bitcoin can easily be reproduced.
**Worst Case Scenario** is the current users gradually use another coin when bitcoin fees get too high or moves too slow and that other coin slowly becomes more appealing because it acts like bitcoin (low inflation) but moves faster. The value of bitcoin is not set in stone. Nor is it use.
**Bitcoin is a competing currency** and it needs to compete otherwise something better will surely take its spot. Bitcoin will never be comparable to gold in the way people view it over other metals or assets. Gold is in some weird category. Gold took thousands of years to become what it is and how it is viewed. Will gold always be viewed like that even when nobody really cares about scarce shiny metals that be reproduced with cheap free energy hundreds of years from now?  I doubt it.

Not a smart move. I bet most of the people that downloaded their app are bitcoin users or are occasional bitcoin users that support bitcoin. It's just another wannabe paypal now.

I think the paper is suggesting that it isn't organic enough to be random traders buying up USDT because the way they were created and distributed (usually single 100 million dollar transactions that were issued within moments of price changes, basically very narrow time frames and destinations) also after they were issued the article suggests that a unique pattern of buying and selling happened on certain exchanges that received the tether.

YouTube is pure free market capitalism at work. Eventually one company makes all the rules and owns everything. If you think about it the end result is the same as communism.

You make a good point. Maybe bitcoin needs multiple phone lines (blockchains).
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:03:46
most likely yes. Though gold took much longer to get where it is today and other fundamentals are at work.
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:58:27
you think if it bounces that high after falling like this 2700 will hold? I don't know man.
and if you look at the chart it had problems many times staying above 2500 - 2600.

nice chart. I wonder what the other major networks look like.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:16:16
when there are more sellers than buyers. when people get cold feet or want to take profit.  when the majority say hey this is crazy no way am I buying this high.

it has been over a year since I seen a 30 cent fee and over 2 months since I seen a 60 cent fee. seen plenty of 1 dollar or more lately.

I don't think you need any special tool. private key used in a btc wallet and bcc wallet will do I believe.

another security measure would be geo location for some users. Put a 48 hour delay if you change locations. I know this is impossible for some.
One more option would be a 2nd password that cannot be changed except by coinbase for any security changes or huge withdraws. They give you a code you need to write down offline. like a pin number and you have to enter it along with verifying by 2fa.
