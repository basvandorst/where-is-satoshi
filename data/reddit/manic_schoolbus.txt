Litecoin will be on LN along with Bitcoin.  They're testing atomic swaps between the two also.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:10:45
Litecoin will have lightning available too - will be interesting to see what happens, with atomic swaps in the mix.  It could further help with scaling issues.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:26:40
I believe that was triggered by Mt Gox incident.  A major Bitcoin exchange folded and lost a lot of user funds.  Confidence in cryptocurrencies took a huge hit, and it took years for Bitcoin to climb out of it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:21:38
Basically, yeah.  With atomic swaps, you can exchange one currency to another instantaneously through an LN exchange node.  It has the potential to balance transaction loads between supporting currencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:00:11
Heh, thought I missed the party at those prices, but could at least get some slow, steady growth on my investment.  My jaw has been on the floor since. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:50:39
No worries, Litecoin will be on the LN also.  And further paired with Bitcoin through atomic swaps. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:15:07
Lightning is coming to Litecoin also.  Ethereum has their own version called 'Raiden' in the works, from what I've heard.  Gonna be interesting to see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:58:14
I don't think the Ethereum fans will like that...
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:56:20
I think so, but only if you have a tolerance for a very high-risk/high-reward play, and only put in what you're willing to lose.  
I kind of saw it as more of a hobby than an investment when I originally got into it a couple years ago, something that was fun to follow with all the volatility, but then I unwittingly caught the huge bull-run and became way more interested in this stuff than I had originally planned.  
@_date: 2019-03-11 03:00:27
I wonder what exactly they had in mind with 'verified identity digital currencies.'  Also, why stop at cryptos?  Why not require I.D. whenever you accept cash too?
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:19:41
Yep, though I feel like I've aged 20 years since then.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:07:31
Gah, it boggles my mind why that coin isn't getting more attention in the market.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:03:34
Crypto is a strange beast.  Because it's a new and revolutionary concept, the prices are still very volatile.  Many people think it's the future, while many others still think it's just a passing fad, and that's why you see such drastic swings in price.  
Depending on the size of the market, big holders definitely have an influence.  Maybe not so much with Bitcoin since it's getting pretty popular and widely distributed, but I also invest in Litecoin, and you can definitely feel it when there are huge players buying and selling.  Sometimes they're courteous enough to announce on the subreddit that they're going to make a big purchase, so you can get in on the 'wave', haha.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:10:37
Thought I had missed the boat big-time when I bought in at $2700 ten days ago.   Since then, this coin has been making more money for me than my day job, haha.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:25:42
Thought I had missed the boat when I bought in at $2700 ten days ago, after the dip to $1800 had passed.  Now I'm feeling pretty fortunate.  You can never really tell with this kind of thing.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:16:55
That's how the market works - cryptos, stocks, or almost anything else we buy or sell.  If people collectively think the item should be valued higher, the holders won't sell and the buyers will keep bidding for higher amounts.  The price is always moving to correspond with this speculation.  It's a giant game of guessing at future value.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:27:28
I'm kicking myself for not buying more when it crashed below $2000 a few weeks ago.  Not sure we'll be seeing that price point again...
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:38:36
Definitely this.  It's painful for me to see people make posts like "I just sold all of my *X* for *Y*!", when they just get burned within a matter of days.  With an investment as speculative and volatile as crypto, it's a good idea to spread your money among the frontrunners and some of the more promising alts.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:45:09
CNBC tends to cover it when it's on a run, but their presenters are kind of a mixed bag on how much they really understand this stuff.

I've seen people make their own price tickers from a Raspberry Pi and an LCD display, I'd like to give that a try if I had the programming skills.
@_date: 2019-10-18 04:24:44
Interesting read - definitely a bit early for them to write off Bitcoin as a 'reliable and attractive' payment method or store of value.  Most of the report only convinces me how much better a decentralized and trust-less system like BTC is over a permissioned stablecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:18:31
Not a bad idea to buy direct from Trezor, but they're based in Europe if shipping overseas is an issue.  They do accept payments in crypto though.  There's a holographic seal on the box, and some adhesive layering to rip through, so you should have a good idea if it's been messed with.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:36:57
At this point, nothing would surprise me in the crypto space.  Uncharted territory for all of us.

Kind of fitting that Adam Smith is eyeing some BTC.

Great investment - love the peace of mind that comes with having a hardware wallet.

Eh, mine was near $140 at the time, but I don't regret it.  Was super anxious to get my crypto off the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:34:45
It's a lot of speculation about whether cryptocurrencies are the future of money, and the markets are running 24/7 worldwide.  On top of that, there's a fixed amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist.  For a newbie, Coinbase is probably the easiest way to buy.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:39:38

Thanks for sharing - interesting part of this to me was his remarks at about 35:30, where each regional stock market (US, Europe, Japan, etc.) seems to go through a heyday and then subsequently goes bust for awhile.  Hard to predict which markets will emerge next though.

@_date: 2017-11-19 19:45:36
Eh, hindsight is 20/20.  Although I now wish I had more invested, I put in only what I was willing to risk - with just 5-10% of my savings in crypto, I feel pretty nervous as it is.  I can't imagine what it's like for those who are going all-in.  Bitcoin is very speculative and can drop just as fast as it rises, and having a diverse set of investments isn't a bad thing.  But I have noticed that I'm picking up better spending habits since I started this, cutting a lot of the nonsense out of my monthly budget to put it towards more coins.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:04:04
Nice.  Always feels good to complete a coin.  But then you start to want another...

As a Litecoin fan, I couldn't help but laugh at that.

That's crypto for you.  We're all gonna be rich, or we're all in for a bad time if this thing bursts again.

Good call.  Don't think I'll be making any more casino trips now that I've gotten involved in crypto - I feel like the odds are a lot better here.

Yep, Bitcoin's tech is available for free.  Anyone can create a coin if they really wanted to.  What gives it value is the amount of people participating in the network.

Without replay protection on the fork, it's not going to be a clean split like Bitcoin Cash was, from what I understand.  Neither side intends to call themselves something other than 'Bitcoin'. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:19:30
Boom goes the dynamite.  5% in a matter of minutes?
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:08:49
It's not a bad idea to move your coins off the exchange to a more secure wallet regardless.  When the Bitcoin Cash fork happened in July, first they said they wouldn't issue users their Bitcoin Cash because they didn't think it would be a successful chain.  Then, when enough people complained they caved and said they'd issue them, but not until January.  So I'm not sure what they're planning with this fork - you may want to move your coins to a hardware wallet to be safe.  Many of these wallet developers will give you instructions on how to split the coin after the fork.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:04:20
Nah, I doubt 1% of the world owns Bitcoin, but it's been growing pretty fast the past few months.  It's not a very stable investment though - only consider it if you can stomach watching your money jump or tank by 10% in a matter of hours.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:06:01
It does pop, but it keeps re-inflating bigger and bigger. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:48:29
Having idly spectated while the price plummeted from $2,700 to $1,800 back in July and subsequently regretting not buying more, I wish I could say I've learned my lesson.  It's hard to make buys now that it's happening again - that saying about catching a falling knife is a good one, I feel like I'm just throwing in some money and watching it blow away in the summer breeze.

Bitcoin isn't mutually-exclusive, though - it can serve both the people interested in the cypher-punk ideals, as well as the investors who are only looking for profit.  I'd argue it's a symbiotic relationship, even.  Like it or not, the investors are helping to accelerate the movement and give it notoriety, and also bring more users into the fold.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:55:12
The Australian government?  Seems like one of the most crypto-friendly from what I've read here - heard you can even pay your taxes in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:41:13
While I agree this all seems like an attempt to wrestle control of Bitcoin away from the core developers, I don't think it's going to succeed as long as there are enough exchanges that are still selling the 'core' version of it.  It's true Coinbase is a huge player, but there are plenty of others that weren't on the NYA and have released statements that they wouldn't support a fork without replay protection.  If these exchanges are all selling different, incompatable versions of what they call 'Bitcoin', it's going to be chaos.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:19:56
Eh, you're not alone.  Bitcoin has as many tales of crippling regret as it does euphoria.  Best you can do is start over - you'd still be an early adopter at this point.

This is nuts.  I never would have predicted these prices a month ago - market showing no fear with the hard-fork looming.  RIP altcoins, BTC seems hell-bent on making everyone bend the knee. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:05:23
At this point, crypto is definitely still a lottery ticket of sorts compared to traditional investments that have been around for hundreds of years.  It's an asset class nobody had dreamed of until a decade ago and is only used by less than 1% of the population (I'm guessing here), so I think it's going to take some more time and adoption before it's truly accepted by the finance industry at large as a worthwhile investment (although Fidelity seems to have gotten on board recently).  There's still a decent chance this could all fold as a 'fad', but if enough people are using it and prices stabilize among the frontrunners, I think they'll finally start to change their tune. 
But with the kind of the returns we've seen lately and the amount of new users streaming in, it's hard for me to imagine why the staunchest of critics aren't throwing in just a minuscule fraction of their savings to insure they don't miss the boat if this is going to be the next big thing. It's sure beating the hell out of the money sitting in my 1.2%-rate savings account. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:26:27
Eh, we all had to start somewhere.  Very few took the plunge back when Bitcoin was dirt cheap and held onto their coins through the price roller-coaster in the years since.  Enjoy the ride - hopefully it's a good one from here.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:41:34
By 'splitting', I mean extracting the new forked version of the coin from the original - you end up with both the original coin and the new coin (in whatever amount of original coin you had before the fork occurred). 
These forks happen due to ideological differences in the Bitcoin community - different groups think it should be upgraded in different ways, so we end up with a few different versions.  I agree it kind of kills the 'brand' and makes it harder for it gain legitimacy and mainstream adoption when this keeps happening, but really Bitcoin is nothing more than an open-source program owned by nobody, so anyone can make their own version if they really wanted.  Whether their version of 'Bitcoin' succeeds is up to the market to decide. 
On the flip side, some people actually like the forks, in that they get 'free coins' out of it if they buy before the fork. You can sell off whichever forked coin you don't want, and turn around and buy more of the other (if you're sure you know which one is going to succeed or fail). 
Anyways, good luck with the hardware wallet.  It's definitely a good investment if you've got a decent amount of coins.  Just remember that you've got control of the private keys instead of the exchange, so you'll want to keep your written recovery seed somewhere very secure in case you lose the wallet. 
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:18:37
I definitely think it will succeed, though I don't think it's going to be a common payment method or displace government fiat currencies anytime soon.  A lot of people here are predicting an upcoming financial apocalypse, but there are developed countries that have been running on huge debt for a long while (see Japan, despite their 'lost decades' of economic growth).  
I see BTC as a good speculative commodity and a hedge against uncertainty along with metals like gold and silver, simply based on it's inherent scarcity.

Sounds like you've done some homework if you've got a ledger and have an idea on the basics of crypto.  If you're willing to risk 200 euro on this, at the very least you'll be getting a lesson in speculative investments vs. savings, which is far better than the things I was spending money on when I was 13.  Good luck.
