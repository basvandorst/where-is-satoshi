 [1] is visualizing the chronological sequence of limit orders on popular exchanges. You can see how those walls are repositioned if the price moves.
Those big positions are an exception. More often those walls consists out of multiple positions spread over a price range. They show up as parallel horizontal lines. If you look at a the usual orderbook graph those spread out positions give an impression of an authentic orderbook imbalance.
Another variation are lots of smaller positions which are canceled after a few seconds reopened gain at a similar price level. I guess they also try to give the impression of a oderbook imbalance, but at the same time try to pretend that the slope is getting steeper. Maybe they try to trigger buy decisions of other bots.

Maybe  is what you are looking for.
I am not sure if a cumulated order book how you describe would give a realistic impression of the current situation. Close to the current price the price differences on the exchanges are difficult to adjust, because you would have to determine the given price on an exchange. You could use the middle between current ask and bid or the the price of the last transaction. But both options are only a approximations which can fluctuate wildly. 
Then you also would have the problem with fake positions. On some exchanges they are quite an percentage of all orders. Have a look at  to get an impression of the differences between exchanges.
