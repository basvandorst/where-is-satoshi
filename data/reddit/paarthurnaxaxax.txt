Coinbase doesn't work for me (and I assume all of Germany), since I couldn't even add a bank account. Not supported yet, I guess.

Doesn't really matter, it's just time-limited.
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:03:37
that would cover the price for 2 separate things I need via bitcoin.

I have a question about localbitcoins. If I buy let's say 42 dollars worth in bitcoin from someone through a bank transfer, will I be able to send the bitcoin I receive there to my "Bitcoin Wallet" app...wallet?

I did word my post weirdly
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:13:24
Just to add, I have done a normal bank transfer before to get bitcoin, now I'd like to pay with my debit card...

What can I do to make you consider? You can always just tell me to send  26 dollars to an email that isn't even connected to your paypal, and when you see that i sent the money because you'll get a notification email, you can connect it to your paypal and send me the equivalent bitcoins. no?

THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh, ok. I remember the tip! that did actually help, and I have purchased bitcoin through a sepa transfer already before. I just need bitcoins now asap, can't wait 2-3 days for the sluggish bank process. But thanks again. and the account i'm using is obviously just a noobs throwaway.
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:06:02
So einfach ist das? Danke, werd's versuchen.
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:21:38
Hmm any other way besides credit card? You sure this will work for Germany? I signed up for Coinbase but I can't do anything because Germany isn't supported.
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:38:07
Is this really that easy? I need to register though.
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:17:46
Because I need to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:45:02
Will this work for Germany? So I just sign up, pay an amount in Euros (to them, or to someone in a marketplace?) and then direct the Bitcoins I get from that to my "Bitcoin Wallet" address?
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:55:50
The cost is 40 usd.
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:04:09
You're so superior you can't spell anymore
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:14:57
How do I do this? The vpn company accepts payments through the Bitcoin Wallet app, so in essence, how do I manage to get $40 worth of bitcoin to my BW address through circle? Again, I'm in Germany.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:48:52
Will do!!
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:41:15
Kenn ich schon...für den vpn brauch ich aber den Bitcoin betrag in meiner "Bitcoin Wallet" app...und da versteh ich kaum wie ich das mit bitcoin.de mache.
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:42:31
Just curious, how would you have wanted me to pay it back?
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:23:01
But 3 cents?????
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:18:48
Yeah I would, but they only have a market, and I have already paid with a bank account before. This time, I'd really just like to pay with my debit and get bitcoin instantly, instead of just waiting 2 - 3 days again. That's why I went for circle, because they apparently send you the bits instantly after payment, but since I'm from Germany, I can't do such a lofty task.
