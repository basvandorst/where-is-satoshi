I believe it - this investment seems highly speculative to many people - but if you look at the growth rates and the upside its a no brainer.

I messaged you on facebook indicating you were trending on the bitcoin subredit and thanking you for your courage in taking a stand against antifa! Did you already know you were trending on this subreddit before I messaged you?

I actually unsuscribed from - I really got tired of altcoin pumpers, conspiracy theories, and the lack of basic respect for Bitcoin Core. Even if you don't agree with Segwit - the amount of bashing and comments coming out of was annoying for me so I left.

I dont go to reddit for investment advice - I listen to me, myself, irene, and donald trump.

Yes - everything you dont agree with must be propoganda - which makes what your saying propoganda? I'm not trying to start a war....but this bitcoin infighting will hurt us all. We all want the same things - I have not slandered you - please dont slander me.

The point I was making is - miners will always act in their best short term interests to recover the capital costs of their very expensive investments. To think for one second a miner is going to vote for ANY change at all that will result in short term lower fees will not occur. Miners will leave us in gridlock (which is why they are split b/t segwit and BU). Minors will purposefullu and strategically NOT Overwhelmingly support either side until such time it is absolutely necessary - such as a currency collapse, overtaken by a competing currency, or somethig else. In the meantime expect gridlock or hard forks to settle this.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to...."

I feel the only way to settle this is to split into two coins - I feel like we are in a republican versus democrat debate with both sides deeply entrenched and would rather die then give in. 
BTC will soon split into bitcoin CORE amd Bitcoin Unlimited coins - and the market will determine which coin gains in value amd which one loses in value.

I actually CANT believe I'm reading this either - you'd trust stakeholders who are SHORT TERM incentivized to CONTROL the Blocksize as a MONOPLY resulting in TXN fees TRIPLING in value! 
Monopolies WILL ALWAYS WORK IN THEIR SHORT TERM INTERESTS. If I can make $1.0M today - versus the potential for $10.0M in the long term - the CHOICE IS OBVIOUS.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone - including my mom for HODLING

AND A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE ELSE AS WELL DEVS, CORE, UNLIMITED, MEETUP ORGANIZERS, CHEERLEADERS, HODLERS, MODERATORS.

BTC mining pools in it's current structure Capt_Roger_Murdock is a MONOPOLY whereby they can control their own income via control of blocksize. MONOPOLY control by a specific group of stakeholders who have an OBVIOUS short-term financial incentive (to recover their capital costs) IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE IN THE LONG TERM.
