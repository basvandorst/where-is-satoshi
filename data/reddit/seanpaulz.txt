Again, I will ask: Who is having talk of making it illegal? If you are referring to Senator Manchin you are horribly outdated on your news. He's even retraced a little bit and stated that it now needs to be observed more (not banned).

People keep talking about how China is responsible for &gt; $1000 prices, but everyone is ignoring the fact that the ONLY reason it got above $1000 was because of price manipulation.
0% fee trading was the cause of that. The Chinese market was controlling the pricepoint of other markets, and the Chinese market was NOT real volume. The price was artificially inflated and I think without that inflation the price would have been 800-950. There was hysteria driving the price. It caused the bubble to pop.

It seems to me the best advice would be to NOT log into your wallet services until you are certain they have deployed the fix.
Logging into a vulnerable wallet provider would set yourself up for a theoretical attack. If you do not log into your account and not unlock your wallet, then there can be no information stored within that server's memory. It would seem likely that very few people (if anyone) had actually exploited this vulnerability. However now that its in the wild everyone and their mom's will be trying to use it. 
I would personally advise to NOT panic and NOT log into your wallet provider (if you use a web wallet) to 'send the coins to a safe place'. Though, in theory, if you log in and send the coin's to cold storage/local wallet they will be gone and by the time the attacker steals your password/keys they will be useless.
If I am incorrect please correct me. Thank you, please come again.

"Now, we admit that we can't imagine people buying a latte at Starbucks using Amazon Coins, but it's significantly more plausible than people using Bitcoin."
He really thinks this? Amazon is big, yes, but they are creating amazon coins for amazon purposes, not general retail. Bitcoin is catch-all store of value intended to be spent on *anything*.

Do you not find it HIGHLY coincidental that out of almost 600 key's, the ONLY key that is missing is the change address?
That does not seem to imply any type of random HD 'corruption'....not when over 550 other private keys all exported juuuuuuust fine.
This is clearly a flaw in the software. I do not doubt you are busy, but frankly whatever you are working on is POINTLESS in lieu of a bug that could potentially cause users to loose 100% of their funds to a improperly generated change address.
I think that investigating this bug is 100x more important than any feature you are working on.
What if this was a big transaction? Im guessing if someone lost 500 btc you would be looking into it. Yet, there is no difference of importance of addressing this issue in relation to the value of money associated with losses.

Where to even start? This paper is HORRIBLE. It has so many facts WRONG.
" On February 10, 2014, hackers
began attacking the world’s largest exchanges
(Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, Cyprus-based BTC-
exchange, and Slovenia-based Bitstamp)
to exploit a flaw in the code that allowed
users to send false requests to resend
payments. The attacks forced the exchanges
to suspend customer withdrawals. Later that
day, Bitcoin’s core developers discovered a
bug in its digital infrastructure. "
The developers suddenly discovered a 'bug' that had been documented since 2011??
" Mt. Gox, for its part, announced
plans to introduce a new identification
system for tracking bitcoin withdrawals, a
move intended to protect against attack and
restore operations."
They did? Seems to me they didnt do a goddamn thing other than scam/steal/loose people's money and try to blame it on a 'bug' that has clearly been demonstrated across several white papers to have not been the culprit behind missing funds.
Whoever wrote this paper needs to get their facts checked by someone other than Leah McGrath.
Dont waste your time reading this. If they cannot even get the basic facts right, do you REALLY trust them to be correct about anything else? Due diligence is necessary in order to provide non-biased and well rounded analysis of data in order to interpret possible outcome.
Something this paper severely lacks.

1) Laws must exist to protect the basic freedom's of the people. If there are no laws then who is to 
prevent Bob from stealing Alice's money? You must have a right to basic freedoms that allow you to 
utilize the money or the money is worthless. 
2) Yes, though less than cash. Cash is a 100% anonymous currency. Where SpaceCash (btc, etc) serves
as a more efficient transfer of wealth. Because SpaceCash can be zapped the speed of light through
tiny tubes into Alice's silicon machine, it makes it more efficient to purchase goods this way. With
cash your options are limited, in the same way that before Credit Cards and then the internet our 
options were limited as to where to buy things and the efficiency of it. You could walk to the store
(your local dealer) and hand him cash for what he has on deck, or you can reach a broader market with
more options with your SpaceCash. Because you don't have to mail a check (IOU), you can receive your
goods faster. 
So long as there is a viable way to exchange SpaceCash for local currencies, then I think the illegal
market will continue to exponentially grow. Less Cash will be used on the streets and more SpaceCash
will be used on the fibernet. The same way that legalizing medicinal cannabis in california has taken
cash off the streets and put it in the pockets of dispensary owners and growing equipment stores. The
same way that Uruguay legalizing cannabis and selling it for $1 a gram will take money out of the cartel's
and put it in the hands of the people. 
The buyer and the seller will 'bear the brunt' of the legalities involved with the buying and selling of
illegal goods depending upon the local laws that apply to their exchange.
3) Regulation is going to happen. However, they cannot truly regulate SpaceCash the same way that you
cannot regulate bittorrent. They will go after the choke points (Exchanges, Money Transmission services)
in attempts at regulation, but the protocol itself cannot be regulated. Any technical obstacle that is
thrown at it will be bypassed. We've seen things like 'sandvine' used at ISP levels in attempt to thwart
the control of our usage, but ultimately the freedom of speech will prevail or our nation has ultimately
4) The future of blockchain technology is bright. Whatever it turns into. As SpaceCash, I see economies
that had no real safe method of money transmission that are finally allowed to bloom. I see global internet
projects and $10 smartphones that allow the 2.5 billion people without a formal banking system to suddenly
be able to store and transact their wealth in rapid efficient means. New trade will bloom, economies will
surge. Wealth will be redistributed. Whether or not it can reverse the flow of the 1% getting richer and
turn the tide into a opposite direction is beyond my tiny think tank's capabilities.

You are focusing on a singular issue and trying to argue it with me and ignoring the greater point. The geico commerical was one single example. There are infinite examples of how advertisements dont have to 'be serious' in order to get across a broad audience.

In a way this is not so much a bad thing. If one technology is superior to another, then we must hold it to higher standards, yes ? If its not reaching new standards, then it is not progress.

So really, this is just a way of taking colored coins but making those specialized coins be a entire blockchain with any parameters preferred?
Im failing to understand the mechanism in which enables it to work. Does this new method just take a bitcoin tx and then peg a chain to it? Or to a number of tx's? Im stuck on the idea that you need bitcoins in order create these new alt chains. But im missing the process.
Also, im assuming that these new chains can then release as many coins as they want for their own chain? So if a 'blue' bitcoin was used to create the 'bluechain' then those coins from those chains could be traded utilizing the vanilla bitcoin protocol?
Who decides what alt chains are accepted/merged mined? 
Im assuming bitcoin miners will be able to mine just the bitcoin blockchain and not the alternative chains attached?
I understand where this is going, just not how its actually getting there.

I think everyone needs to stop being so naive about the terminology. Yes, I understand the author's might have related the term 'dark' to essentially 'free', but can you REALLY think that their goal is specifically  *just* a free market when their clear intentions are specifically for silk road type markets?
Read what they are saying in the wired article:
*He compared DarkMarket’s improvements on the now-defunct Silk Road to the advent of Bittorrent, a decentralized technology that revamped Napster’s more vulnerable model of filesharing and flummoxed copyright enforcers. “Like a hydra, those of us in the community that push for individual empowerment are in an arms race to equip the people with the tools needed for the next generation of digital black markets.”*
CLEARLY the aim is for drug bazaars, and while yes, the network effect means there will be more open free trade in general, do not confuse their goals.
Which is exactly why I support changing the name and agree with the OP. They are damning themselves and giving the media a extremely easy target by putting their foots in their mouths with comments like the above.
Focus more on freedom, privacy and free market concepts, and forget all this 'dark' talk. Its absurdly stupid when you are looking for adoption to name your creation after the boogey monster (even if it is just people's general perception of terminology. Its not about what it means, its about what people THINK it means)
Wired article here:
