Well kids what did we learn here?   
Keep your damn mouth shut. No one needs to know anything about your financial doings.

NO Kidding. I was talking about this with my roomie at lunch. I can legally carry a firearm if I wish. And maybe I do. I might die from my wounds, but I can hit the target 50% of the time at 100ft with a 3 inch barrel so there would be more than one funeral.

Ha, because it is smart.

Except there isn't near enough supply of it to launder the billions of dollars they are trying launder.   
Maybe someday when the entire crypto market is trillions, but until then the amount of money they are cleaning is far to high.

Bingo on the reasons, and the cost will be substantially higher because of the route they are taking. You could say the government(S) are posturing for their own good image.
Though I do think EVs will have their hand in the crypto world, the economics of if are what they are.

Any form of currency or store of value uses massive amounts of energy. Though Crypto is in the lead the technology is changing and could improve energy usage. Gold, Silver, Dollars... All require massive amounts of energy to Mine, Print, Ship, Store ect.

I agree. Stepping stones, my dude. The first tech of this sphere was proof of work. Super awesome ledger accounting method. The others that follow also have their pros and cons as the first one and through this we will find what works. 
Horses required tons of fuel to pull buggies back in the day and now even electric cars can use up to 4-5 times the amount of fossil fuels required vs Fuel if the electricity they use is dirty. 
Stepping stones.

I'm already getting my popcorn ready for when the $5T crypto bubble pops. That will be a good show.

Who knows. I just wanted to show that the last drop wasn't uncalled for and if cycles repeat it was necessary.

you say that now, but

65% to a marketcap of 21T?

Seriously though.. It isn't hard to explain what it is.  Fact is people are retarded and cant seem to understand what a bookkeeping ledger is, let alone trying to explain hex algos.

Nice!! Thank you. Is this your creation or something you found?

The ignorance I hold for not knowing how bad it is keeps my sanity in hand. 
Civilization is totally fucked. But we have been here many times before. Ebb and flow, my dude.

Biggest reason for divorce is finances. 
So the largest reason people get divorced are because they can't keep the books properly. Either from communication or poor discipline. 
Retards. All the way.
