I posted this on the newbie forum also, so I'm not sure if this is being resolved yet...
 I've messaged your support several times about a failed transaction from January this year.  The quote ID is:  324e6ca9-0291-45da-bc15-4451135c87ed
The last thing I heard from Rachael and Seth was that this would be resolved in a few business days.  That was 12 days ago.  I haven't heard anything since then.  I did request that the funds be sent to a different payment account.  The new account is:

I tried purchasing some bitcoins back in January and the transaction failed as well.  I got a reply from support that it would be taken care of on Monday, but so far nothing has been done.  Since then, I've been unfortunate enough to lose the wallet info due to a reformat of my computer (luckily nothing was in it).  Can I PM you the details to see if you can resolve this to me and send the BTC to a different wallet address?

The only thing I can think of is that I screwed up and lost my wallet info from the first transaction and I asked them to send it to a different address.  If they suspected some sort of fraud on my end, the least they could to is say so and give me the chance to prove I was the originator of the transaction.

I had a failed transaction from January 15th that still hasn't been resolved.  I submitted 2 support tickets online because I stopped getting any response about the first one after a week.  I just went to check the status of my tickets now to find out they suspended my account!  I'm assuming this is because they don't want to pay out the ~400% increase in value between then and now.
Hopefully if enough people post information like this, nobody will make the mistake of using their service in the future.
