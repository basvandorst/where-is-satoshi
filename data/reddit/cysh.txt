Central banks would still have the power to print and allocate their money at will, the status quo of wealth distribution would not be threatened anymore by peer to peer money.
^ This I think is more important than anything else. While bitcoiners are busy fighting over blocksize the banks have quitely been putting the pieces into place (R3 &lt;- this is quite amazing in itself all these legacy competitors agreeing to partner up in what appeared to be such a short period of time, Chain moving to Enterprise clients, MSFT adopting ETH on Azure, etc.). The tactic is called "divide &amp; conquer" by the time Bitcoiners look up they will be promoting their "trusted" blockchain that is more secure, faster, yaddda, yadda, blah, blah to the general public. Unfortunately the sheeple will not know any better. And that leads to "Why do I need bitcoin again"? 
Now I think that bitcoiners are indeed smarter than the bankers but what the bankers have that bitcoiners do not, is utter mastery in manipulating the public opinion for their benefit for the last 400+ years.

The general education system at least here in the US is not designed to make you aware of the world around you. It is training our youth to be loyal, obedient employees who pays their taxes on time, but simultaneously throws you further into debt by mass marketing "trinkets" that no individual really needs to live a happy life.

When I see a wall of text I'm excited to jump in, merely for the fact that this poster felt they had something to say. That they would put a more than usual amount of time into something that may or may not get read by the large majority of users. Any insights however long are welcome by me.

This is more important than people know or take for granted. The elite powers who are proposing these regulations are trying to prevent the collapse of the lies they have built and the demise of fiat currencies. 
But please be aware that this is more than an attack on bitcoin but an attack on the rights of the human race. I know everyone here knows this but let me leave a reminder that **"he who controls the money, controls the people".**

2014 has been a great year for bitcoin adoption, acceptance, and innovation. But the price has lost more than half of it's value since the beginning of the year.

Every good wallet changes bitcoin addresses every time your in good hands you should be worried if the address never changes.

I concur... This was the same feeling I had when I first used bitcoin. I'm excited to see many more people will get to have that feeling for the first time. It's a truly freeing emotion.

This is the shameful part of the piece to me and starkly highlights the need for such a technology as bitcoin.

I think whats more concerning is this guy is going around to prominent institutions and doesn't understand the Bitcoin protocol at all. Right now he's excited about touting the advantages of the protocol. But make sure you truly understand what is and does before going around and spewing false incorrect information. Dude should hit the wiki up and spend a couple of months getting his head around WTF he is talking about.

Let me just say they are starting to get scared of the possibilities of bitcoin supplanting their powers to be. Remember first they laugh at you, We are going through the end of this stage with other smart people spending their time and money on growing bitcoin. We are now entering the stage where they fight us. NYDFS regulations, Now this CFPB FUD being created and soon to be circulated. 
Now think about what this does to consumers who read the Consumer Protection report and eventually come to the conclusion that this is more trouble than it's worth to wrap my head around. 
I've been in bitcoin since early 2013 and after reading it I said to myself if I didn't know any better this would turn me off to idea or wanting to learn anymore about it. This is report is filled with misinformation while some of it does hold some truth the majority is ill-informed for the general public.

Please by all means spend the next week on educating yourself, trust me the knowledge you'll gain will empower you. Once educated on the details and how easy it is to move value around the world, you may think twice about liquidating. 
Seriously.... Look at the potential in the technology and protocol and how it can help the other 5+ billion people who can not participate in a global economy play on a leveled playing field is where the value lies and not the current price that people are paying with fiat "funny" money

Ha!! Thousands of users. Circle is a joke, if I'm not mistaken block chain/coinbase/mycelium all had HUNDREDS of thousands of users in that same time frame. Allaire had some successful startup exits in the way of Macromedia, &amp; Brightcove (which is public) but is taking the same approach to bitcoin. What he doesn't understand is that he is continuing the old agenda in a different medium. Many of us here are trying to rewrite the future. This guys is toxic to the future decentralization of digital finance. Jeremy I hope you see this and rethink the path you are taking and focusing on providing a better future for your children and the world in general and not short sighted lining your pockets, which you can't take with you when you die.

I tried using the Robocoin BTM at The D Casino about a week ago and it was down. Asked a worker there does it work, and he said every time they come out to fix it a week later it's down again. 
I've been in bitcoin for about two years and needless to say I was bummed. I can only imagine the impression it leaves on new users. The employee there said people are always putting their credit cards in the wrong slot. The Robocoin was too cumbersome to use for a new user, hell even my eyes glossed over a bit looking at all the openings in the machine and figuring out where to start.

Really quick idea to monetize your art. Would be to drop a light colored or complimentary colored QR code in the bottom corner of your art and then no matter where they end up people can always give some coin. I thought it would be a great way to always monetize the art now and long into the future.

For the first time in 60 yrs Visa is opening up there network to developers. To me this seems like an attempt to fend off developers finding out about Bitcoin and hence allow them to build comparable apps or infrastructure that would then compete with Visa.

This is pretty bad, not only in a sexist way but you alienate and/or offend an entire other half of the population. As someone who's involved in marketing as my 9-5. I would strongly suggest changing it. If anyone has been following tech news recently there is a big kerfuffle in regards to diversity and gender equality.

This whole NSA mess is just one more shot in the arm of bitcoin acceptance. Without the power of controlling fiat currency many of these powerful people will be reduced from the grasp they have on the world, I can only hope.

Do you mean the service CoinGuard?, so basically 3 keys are generated, one goes to the buyer, one goes to the seller and the third is created when the wallet and 3rd key (payment invite) are generated. Upon successful transactions the buyer hands over there key to the seller releasing the funds, but I think in the event of a dispute a third party must step in to mediate the escrow. 
Bitcoin is still very new and lots of services are cropping up to address alot of the infrastructure issues, so growing pains are to be expected be excited that we are all part of something that will change the future of our world as we know it.

Usability is huge when it comes to designing mobile apps. Think less is more, utilize the menu options, and try to remove elements instead of adding them. Also alot of apps are going with a more minimal style easier on the eyes and ability to digest the data.

I've been actively working on a bitcoin escrow that addresses all the points made here. The site doesn't hold any bitcoin on the server or for that matter even know the bitcoin address of the escrow transaction. 
So you may be wondering how do we handle any disputes? If all goes well the buyer will hand over their keycode to the seller resulting in the seller using all 3 keys to unlock the private key to the wallet that only those two involved know what it is. 
In the event of a dispute any and all evidence is presented to the dispute agent and they can make a unbiased judgement and release the keys to the appropriate party. 
I would love if people could try it and give me your feedback on the site. It's [coinguard.org](

1. Open a new bank account
2. Withdraw all money but $1.00 - $10.00 - (just in case they try and charge you a account closure fee)
3. Throw that letter in the trash. 
What they are doing is blackmailing you into providing information that you have the right not to disclose. 
Good luck

China maybe the biggest benefactor from the use of bitcoin as they have been looking for ways to replace the USD as the global reserve currency.
