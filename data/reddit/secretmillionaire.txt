6 people i know invested at ATH prices. I never sold them on it, I was basically bragging about how much mine had increased and they all wanted in. I’d been speaking of it for a while but it wasn’t until the ATH when everyone was talking about it when they finally decided to pull the trigger

So just the seed alone grants access to any wallet?

Use bittylicious and get a Revolut account

But just the recovery phrase alone can’t do anything right? Don’t they need the public address too? Why would you enter your public address?

Sorry I cba to find the video, but I’ve deffos seen one where he basically says he won’t actually eat his dick on live tv if his prediction doesn’t turn out to be true. He says something along the lines of he will outsource the dick eating to one of his amazing prostitution and by eat he means get a blowjob

The ELI5 version is it basically does what a bitcoin mixer does but automatically on every transaction. It’s actually an old hard fork of the bitcoin blockchain intended to make all transactions untraceable

Why is your neighbour spying on you and how did you find out?

There’s a chippy in my home town with a sticker on the window saying ‘bitcoin accepted here’. 
The first time I went in they were amazed I was asking to pay with bitcoin. They went and got their QR codes (to deposit to a Coinbase wallet) only to realise they had no way to check whether it had been received. The QR code didn’t work so after trying to figure it out for 10 mins they told me to leave it for now, take my fish &amp; chips and come back another time to pay the £12.50. 
I’ve been 3 times since and they still have no idea how to accept my payment, sometimes the owner isn’t in and the staff look at me like I’m speaking Chinese. It’s frustrating but understandable and clearly issues like this are going to be sticking point for mass adoption when it comes to face to face payments.

I mean they’re understandably a little pre-occupied atm

Interesting thanks for that. Why though would claiming to be satoshi benefit him when it comes to disputing the theft of his late partners bitcoin?

That’s what solutions like Neo Name Service are for. You get a personalised domain such as ‘myaddress.neo’ and use that as your public address

I was trading bitcoin on local bitcoins in the UK. Ended up getting too many people claiming charge backs with their bank and getting a cifas marker on my credit file. Couple weeks later every bank I had an account with contact me saying they’re withdrawing my banking facilities. 
Now I’m stuck unable to open a bank account and having to use pre-paid online solutions which can be frustrating and slow!

Anyone got a link to buy the shirt? I found it but it doesn’t have the bitcoin logo on the sleeve :(

Why does it say planned as in the past tense? Is it launching this coming Sunday?

Just keep hold of it. If the btc price doubles you can sell half for 850 and you’ve got 850 of free bitcoin to keep hold of incase it keeps rising. Or it might go down, nobody really knows and now could be the best point to sell. If I were you I’d keep it in a secure wallet and just forget about it for a few years

I’d also want one of these
