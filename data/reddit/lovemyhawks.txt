Sorry for your loss of coins. I hope threatening a legal case will push them to return them to you. Be sure to record all the transactions (both blockchain and cash deposits). Regardless, your life isn't worth a measly $20,000 AUD. Live, learn and move on, my friend.

Coinbase is good for starting out. Please be aware that they are a bitcoin-bank. They store bitcoin on your behalf. Do not think that the bitcoin in your Coinbase account belongs to you because it doesn't.
Don't keep any bitcoin on Coinbase that you wouldn't be comfortable losing. You might be better off using a smartphone wallet (Mycelium, Breadwallet, AirBitz, etc.) Check the sidebar and top sticky for beginner help.

A single node behaving as a bad actor could certainly attempt to broadcast a false transaction, however, the network will not agree with that node. If a node continues to behave in this fashion, they can be [banned from the network](

Depends on your bank in some aspect. The big banks (Wells Fargo, Chase, etc) seem to be really strict in this aspect. Haven't heard much fuss from smaller banks. However, the end-all is that if you purchase bitcoin with your checking account, the bank will know, or you'll at least be inviting them to know. 
If you don't want them to know, withdraw cash and purchase bitcoin with LBC as you've already mentioned. 
The problem is that most people don't care if their banks know, but the banks have bitcoin pinned to a terrible stigma, so if they see it, ~~there's a good chance they'll freeze or close your account~~ there's been reports of closed accounts in the past. As mentioned, be safe and use cash
