You have a lemonade stand and it's getting good business but the line is getting backed up, it's super popular because of grandpaps secret recipe. 
Timmy thinks he see's a flaw in your lemonade makes a new stand, tells everybody in your line...and the neighborhood, even that weird kid jimmy down the street, that his stand will sell Strawberry Lemonade and have 2 lines! On top of that said it will be open in about 30 days. 
Some people got excited, some people stuck with Grandpaps secret recipe and some weird kids with tinfoil hats where just holding onto the sold lemonade and not drinking it.
But Timmy opens up his stand the next day!  The line is in hysteria  (crazy) and people sell your lemonade for his knock off, store bought Strawberry lemonade! The tin foil hat kids are sitting on the ground rocking back and forth muttering HODL, HODL it seems that's all they can say now. 
To make it worse Timmy told weird kid Jimmy that he was going to open early, Weird kid jimmy drives the price up for personal weird kid gain. So Timmy and Jimmy are the new kids in town but because jimmy is driving a lambo all of a sudden they suspect the inside deal.
Good news though, your stand keeps getting more popular and in the panic some of the lemonade buyers gave some homeless guys a chance and turns out they might have a future in food stands.
My first Eli5, hope you could read it, all done in one pass on my phone

Day trading. Buying low and selling high. Someone here can give a more detailed answer then I can but I think that's the answer to your question

Quick question on the lightning network, is it for Bitcoin and Litecoin or just Bit coin? I've read contradicting things and am also new to the BTC scene and there's lot of bad info.

Thank you for this

Can you elaborate on your comment above? and maybe his reply? I've seen you comment on quite a few things I've been reading and you seem to know a few things.
 
I'm new to trading and am gathering as much knowledge I can before making it an investment. Thanks Rook

Can you Eli5?

Not doing day trading but am having a lot of fun learning the ropes. Given this extremely volatile time with crypto and that's what everyone's talking about. 
Can you elaborate on this advice you gave? It seems pretty straight forward, but how would one set those variables with the tools available on gdax or any given exchange? Thanks! 
Trying to learn as much as possible and am loving this.

Binance

new here, FUD?

Binance is nice, coinbase is the most simple but you pay for that luxury in fees. That's my opinion any who.

What about a proud apache helicopter?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:08:24
Eli5 what this is?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:03
Also I'm new to this, but what gdax did was fishy. Anyway gave me a dip!

Thanks!

From what I've gathered and someone correct me if I'm wrong, once all the coins are mined there will be fees regardless, and the miners get those fees for confirmation.
