So is everyone just pissed off that he actually has lambos and they don't? Not defending him, but I don't get the hate. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:34:21
What did this guy do wrong, exactly? Is he a douche like Roger Ver? Or are people just jealous of his success? Or is he even successful? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:29:24
Get a job, you pathetic bum.

Alt coins like Ether have been systematically taking away bitcoin's marketshare. You have coins like IOTA and Vchain partnering with major companies with innovative use cases that have real world applications.
I'm not saying bitcoin's days are numbered, but it is inevitable that it will be dethroned.
"some people won't cash out bitcoin Becuase they trust it more as a store of value than banks"
How can you look at bitcoin's value falling ~8k in less than a month and say with a straight face that it's a better store of value? It's fucking gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:45:14
It's not that hard. Take the "imaginary bitcoin price" , multiply it by your current bitcoin holding, and subtract your initial investment.
Let's say you bought 0.1 BTC at 10k.
Your initial investment was 1k.
So take your imaginary number, and times it by 0.1 to find X. 
X - 1k = profit. 
Not to be a dick, but this is like, middle school arithmetic.

Thanks a lot for the info. I'm going to look into it right away. Iv been meaning to order a Ledger but thought it was unnecessary until coinbase went down earlier this week and I felt powerless. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:41:56
This. I can't tell if OP Is trolling or not. Poes Law is real. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:20:00
I can't take this seriously when the author can't use apostrophes correctly/differentiate between "its" and "it's" 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:35:55
You bring up good points, and it's something I struggle with as well. Don't expect any meaningful conversation in the echo chamber, however.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:17
Bumped cause I'm also interested.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:26:12
I love reading all these pretentious douche bags pretending they're more virtuous than you and that their reasons for buying are superior to yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:03:58
It must suck being so inarticulate and myopic.

I use coinsquare, I think that is probably your best option. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:14
I know your intentions are light-spirited, but you're going to get shit on.  Brace yourself for, "REEE WHY WOULD I EVER TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HOLD? HACKERS!"
Look at the graphs at how much Bitcoin was in the summer (~5k CAD) and how much it is now (~23K CAD)
It's fair to say that most people who got in within the last 6 months and have held have probably quadrupled their initial investment. For those who got in years ago, well, do the math.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:52:12
Why didn't you give more? It's an urgent problem in the world today. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:33:34
Yes, No. Maybe. I don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:38:12
Move your btc to coinbase. Test your ledger. If it's right, move it back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:31
Wut? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:46:40

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:05:13
What'd you give, douche bag? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:44
Holy hell you people are stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:47:15
Hey, could you tell me anything about gdax? I bought about 0.1 BTC from coinbase back in the summer and also have some ether and litecoin, and Coinbase still hasn't lifted my $250 a week limit.
Can I purchase BTC on gdax as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:49
That's some in-depth analysis 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:53
It's sad to see such a nice comment and a bunch of people trying to scam it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:23:54
I use coinsquare 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:40:26
Yeah, I see that now. At first it was just a few hundred, but I bought in at a good time and it's climbed quite a bit, especially with regular contributions and price averaging. Is it safe getting a Ledger off amazon? I heard some people are hacking physical wallets, selling them, and stealing the info. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:32
Did you miss the entire purpose of bitcoin? A decentralized currency - do you know what decentralized means? This is almost satire if it weren't so sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:58:13
Take this off, man. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:14:59
No one knows. In two days It could go down and you'd have been better off waiting, or it could go up and you'd have been better off buying today.
If you want to minimize risk, take what you were going to invest, and put in half now, and do half in a few days.
Anyone who claims to know what is going to happen is lying to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:26:15
You're not wrong - asking the bitcoin community their opinions on how a deregulated global currency would exacerbate wealth inequality is a good question.
You're just too stupid to phrase it that way and can't stay on topic. Also, maybe it's you who should get out of your parent's basement  - classic projection, buds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:06:45
What? Coinbase is an exchange. Don't keep your coins there. Get a paper wallet or invest in a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:42:45
I don't even own bitcoin but wanted to chime in to tell you that you're a moron. You're letting a emotion-driven narrative about an imaginary future with immense bitcoin wealth inequality prevent you from having an actual discussion or, God forbid, learning anything. 
Current fiat currencies aren't "fair and balanced" either. You sound like a well-intentioned person, but you're  just coming across as some pseudo socialist dumbass making an argument against libertarianism and think you're making a coherent point about bitcoin or cryotocurencies in general - well, you're not. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:54:09
I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm questioning your authority and methodology. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:16:29
You seem to, in fact, have the time because you're writing essays to everyone, myself included, who points out that you're clearly a very stupid person who can't formulate arguments.
Your initial post displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how economies or currencies work, and your comments are irrelevant to your initial argument. Swim along now, stupid shark. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:28:16
Yeah, you know more than seasoned  wall street investors because you bought bitcoin a few months ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:40
As someone struggling through a similar situation, I hope this is real and that you find happiness. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:24:17
What did I just read? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:05
It's not an opinion. You don't have any bitcoin or you wouldn't be begging for it. That shows you're not an expert and are not qualified to create a course. Good luck, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:57:21
Uhhh. No? Or else they'd be rich.
Bitcoin might keep going up. Or it might  go down.
Your alt coins might go up, or they might go down.
Anything you do is a risk, and crypto is inherently volatile. 
Personally, I think BTC right now is the safer bet, so cash out and buy into BTC. if you believe in its long term potential, then you're still in the early adopter stage.
What alts do you have? I might be willing to trade some. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:48:21
Well now I feel bad. What would help you? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:58:29
Some people don't have food and a place to sleep and you think you should get a free bitcoin so you can buy presents? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:01
Buy more now and thank me later.
Remindme! One month.
Bitcoin at 13,000CAD

Trump tactics? What the fuck are you talking about? If pointing out that you don't have an argument and are clearly not as educated as you think you are on this topic is "Trump tactics", then sure.
When Trump argues, he likes to avoid questions and doesn't provide evidence and when he does, it's usually false evidence, just like  you just did when you said BTC dropped to 9k.
If anyone is Trump - a blundering, misinformed moron who uses inaccurate evidence to support his positions - then it's you. I'm not being facetious, you might be the dumbest person iv ever encountered on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:04
Yeah, I see it. It's not $9000. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:33
Tl;dr: waiting for a dip is a stupid stragety. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:50
Nope, it's still at over 10k USD, are you blind as well as stupid? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:04:48
No, it's not at all like that, you dumb fuck. Google the general probability of a stock going up or down - it's near equal. In fact, on average they DO appreciate over time. 
I'll dumb it down for you: there's isn't an overwhelming reason to think BTC won't continue to climb, and there isn't an overwhelming reason to think it will drop. Therefore, waiting for a drop is basically a 50/50 strategy. It COULD drop over the next few days allowing you to buy in for cheaper; or, it could continue to climb - as it has for the last few months - and you'd have been better off buying in today.
Understand? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:35
Look at my comment chain with him. He's not too bright. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:03:00
I said the same thing over the summer when it was around 5K. Realized that it has the same odds to go up than it does to go down. Buy now, and some later.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:01
Editing insults? It's very clear to anyone who reads this that you're not very smart and out of your element here. Your irrelevant replies and inability to provide a logical counterpoint should be insulting enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:42:22
Hi, thanks for your comment.
How do I go about doing this? What brand did you buy? Are some more trusted than others? What does a wallet look like? Is it just a USB drive?
Also, do I miss out on FORKS by not having it stored on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:27
Where is the star that I edited my comment, then? I'm clearly not afraid of insulting you.
Tl;dr: you're an idiot.
