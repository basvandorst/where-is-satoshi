fuck amazon.
these co. sitting pretty, i.e.-warren buffet, bozos, apple, big banks, their doing well as is, with status quo, they don't want to help the billions unbanked, lower the transactional costs for millions of merchants.
well, fuck them.
they will all have to fall in line, whether today or tomorrow, or in 5 years,

correction, Facebook has now gone from $0 to $155Billion in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:18:50
If Bitcoin saves $100Billion dollars, shouldn't it itself be worth like 3 times that or $300Billion dollars.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:42:21
There needs to be easier way for people to simply buy Bitcoins.
As it stands getting some Bitcoins takes a monumental amount of effort, especially for the average day person.
If a company can be formed that makes buying Bitcoins as easy as filling up gas, we would really see the price go to the moon.
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:52:49
This is not based on silly post. It's based on my past considerable analysis that Bitcoin will be worth $2Trillion in fairly shorter period of time than most people think.

this is exactly why price will go down further.
there is still no blood on the street.
its precisely people like you that has to be selling in order for the price to bottom out.
we haven't hit the bottom yet by a long shot.

But going from

$626.73 in

@_date: 2014-03-27 23:21:57
I saw an analysis that we are headed into $300's once we broke $500. 
Do not buy quite yet.  This is going to break hard into the $300's thats when you want to be ready for.

Intrinsic value - you ask $659 worth?
is twitter really worth $30,000,000,000.
is facebook really worth $140,000,000,000
and Bitcoin which is much larger than both these companies is worth only $8 billion.  are you kidding me.

The other thing, Bitcoin visibility just got a lot higher.
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:27:04
yeah, that's the theory supposedly another better cryptocurrency will come along.
kind of makes you wonder what was MySpace doing?  When they see a competitor like Facebook, why they didn't copy what they were doing right. kind of makes you think they were sleeping on the job.
Bitcoin has another advantage. It has all the eyes of developers around the world and when they see something good in another cyptocurrency, Bitcoin will just absorb it. It is futile to resist. star trek.

we are only at $0 to $6Billion in just 5 years. and Winklevoss twins are right when they predicted earlier this week that Bitcoin is bigger than Facebook.  We still need to go up another 25x times to just be par with Facebook, which I don't use and have no interest in using.

they would have counted # of Bitcoins they had matched it up with number of Bitcoins coming in - number of Bitcoins going out.
there is no way these idiots one day decide to count and see that they are 744,000 Bitcoins short.  no way.
inside job straight up.  Mark probably has id in his thumbdrive in his pocket.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:18:57

$100,000 per BTC puts the market cap only at $1.3Trillion.
Gold is at $7Trillion.
so it will most likely surpass $100,000 per BTC since it is better than gold for numerous reasons other than store of value.

any 1 of 7 things can make this blowup to $10,000 easy.
1)  ETF - so alternative to over bloated stock market. $Trillions would flood into Bitcoin
2)  Africans really adapt this for remittance
3)  Alternative to gold.  remember gold is at $7Trillion dollars.
Bitcoin would have to be $3million a piece to achieve just same value
4)  Alternative to credit card, alternative to visa and master card.
5)  Businesses start to accept it as an alternative to banking system.
I detest the banks; they held me up a whole month before I could set my business account up.
6)  etc, etc.

I picked up 5 more Bitcoins in the 400's by following Warren Buffet's dictum, buy when others are panicking. 
It looks like with mtgox crap out of the way, we can finally breath and it really looks like this is going to go to $50,000.

@_date: 2014-03-12 22:03:13
$5billion --&gt; $0 in 9 months.
insiders trying to cash in on bloated market.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:07:42
I guess the supply of Bitcoin just got a lot smaller. 
employees of mtgox stole your Bitcoins I'm sure of it.
Don't let them get away with it.
The other thing, Bitcoin visibility just got a lot LOT higher.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:52:53
well, I see a rapid adoption of businesses accepting Bitcoin.
I've also watch now a few videos of Africans using Bitcoin so I think we are well on our way.

Ohhh.  Gold has intrinsic value. You can hold it. It is shiny. 
What? What is this. The hobbit ring?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:39:54
Giving up, you fuck pathetic shit.
I give you Harakiri !!!
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:00:05
in japanease, the honorable thing left for someone like mark, is self suicide, often called Harikiki.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:54:02
well, the thing that will make Bitcoin really valuable and away more valuable than anything in the world is that it is like a trust fund without all the cost of legal fees etc. This is only one example, I can think of a dozen uses right off the bat but this is just one.  
For example, wills. One can put in a Satoshi, all the records of a will so I can put at my death, all the proceeds of this one Satoshi which includes the deed of trust to all my properties shall pass to my kids. So essentially becoming a living will.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:41:42
mark and mtgox employees stole them for sure. the temptation is too good for these immoral unethical scumbags.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:49:29
I told you so,
here we go again.
$458 now in China.
wait for the $300's.
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:41:55
I like your thinking.
So based on real true past history analysis, even
is not outside of realm of possibilities.
All you assholes calling me crazy for predicting $10,000
will be eating crows when Christmas rolls around.

@_date: 2014-03-09 09:38:40
well it just means you can buy a whole lot of shit with 1 Bitcoin.
better denominate in Satoshis then.  
1 Satoshi = .000000001 Bitcoin

american stock market is a fucking farce.
twitter.com  --&gt; -1.69(negative) earnings
a stupid high school kid site is worth $32Billion or 4x Bitcoin with is world changing technology is worth.

This google person must be quite ignorant of the history of cyber currencies that have existed in the past 25 years.
I can't list them all here, but there has been many, like cybercash, e-gold, e-bullion, many iterations of cyber currency before Bitcoin.
he should be fired for being so stupid.
