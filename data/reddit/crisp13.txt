Seventh picture from the top.. holy fuck that bussing is just open?... That is dangerous as FUCK. Get between those three metal bars (red, green, yellow) and you are ZAPPED like a bug.
Source: I work for a company that makes stuff like that and I price it up.
Video for reference of a guy de-racking a breaker off of bus bars:  (NSFW - pretty much an explosion) search "arc flash" on youtube.

But if they screw everyone over (51%) and change the blockchain and double spend wont that make everyone sell their remaining coins, thus making Bitcoin worthless, and thus putting themselves out of business?

Theyre gonna make a cool video about Bitcoin and not put any address to donate?

I don't care how you do it, but store your coins in Armory.

Is that the home from Weekend at Bernie's?

Very well made! another inaccuracy - Paypal technically does not accept bitcoin it was their subsidiary braintree that accepts it.

Regardless of the validity it looks like they are typical questions for people opening stock trading accounts on TD Ameritrade or E trade etc cetera

You know the bull run is over when you see something like this... I bet we hang  below 900 for a month or two

Shame that people cant be objective here. While btc has the first mover advantage and the strongest dev network, we have to acknowledge that there is a realistic risk that another comes along.
