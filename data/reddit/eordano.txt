Yes, that's why I wrote


It's not an anonymity check tool, and the only input that you give to it is one bitcoin address. Far more powerful stuff could be made with more input info.
I agree that generating new addresses is next-to-useless, but it's a starter. There's no wallet out there that uses coinjoin by default.
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:53:47
It is a core issue for the environment, not for the core developers. And right now with the privacy advise against coinjoin, there's no such technology until we get dark wallet.
I just don't like the idea of having all my bank account's transaction info and showing it around to whomever I transact with. Why does all this people need to know about all my money, my transactions, people I deal with, and so forth?

The article doesn't mention the distribution of the last bit of the nonce. Sergio Lerner's hypothesis, as I recall, was that Satoshi had a modified client, running on 5 computers and each one of these computers used different bits at the end of the nonce to avoid collisions.

Actually, the inverse is happening. There's more demand for pesos than for bitcoins: a number of freelancers/small business are using it to bring home some dollars and change that at the "Blue Rate" (as they still have to pay for everyday life and salaries in pesos). Turns out that the offer of bitcoins is stronger than demand.

* If you say "Trust me, you should distrust X system" the other person can take a few moments to check the reasons why he trusts X and carry on, and doesn't have to trust you.

From a fellow argentinian, ¡Cómo se te ocurre ahorrar en pesos, chabón!
The thing is, not many people have access to investments and things like that (half of the population has no bank account). Even worse, those without access to banks mostly end up taking debt just to pay off living expenses. And even within those with bank accounts, the financial education is terrible. Government bonds is actually a pretty safe and good investment, because the government is scared as SHIT of not getting international loans, so they play nice and pay off always and on time, with great margins and in dollars.
Obviously, we the people end up paying that. Argentina is getting worse and worse... That definitely has to change.

Governments have no profit signal that helps them to make good decisions. Unfortunately you can't discuss with a monopoly.
They can say whatever they want and they will never stand corrected, that's just the way they are. Bureaucrats like this Ben dude are regulating something even though they never had a job outside of "the public sector", are not even economists (I heard he's a lawyer), and never even got a bit (as in information theory, a zero or one) of feedback on whether he did good or bad (called "election").

Regarding the audit; they should work on having a transparent and verifiable system (it can be done! some exchanges have online proof of deposits); but doing a full audit one time may not be the quickest process.

1 mBTC != 1 millibit; 
1 mBTC = 1 millibitcoin. No concensus has came to call anything a millibitcoin as far as I know (millie being the largest contender). Should the price of 1 BTC become larger (as many in the community believe so), using bits will someday become less weird than it is now, saying "I'll send you 10000 bits" to something like "it's 500 bits".

I'd argue that those corporations and cartels are worse now than ever, even though we have extensive and huge laws and governmental institutions to prevent it. See the Libor scandal for example, trillions of dollars stolen, and your government particularly did nothing to prevent it.
This law is extremely cumbersome and extensive to the point where it's impossible to comply. If you take a look at it, it's pretty much as if you'd have to have the bank account number of every person that visits your website if you put a Bitcoin sign on it.

Downvoted your first paragraph as it's totally unnecessary.
The question was: "are decentralized systems less efficient?" the answer is yes, they are, but that's missing the point, as there are other properties that a decentralized system has that a centralized one may not.
They are less efficient. Take for example, the long confirmation times or the proof of work: these are not needed if you have a central source of authority.

Invalid addresses are very scarce and you have way more chances of hitting an address with an invalid checksum (and having your wallet allow you to lose your funds) than writing an invalid address.
An invalid "address" is one related with a public key that doesn't belong to the elliptic curve selected by Bitcoin.

Yep, but the method is different.
Suppose that I have a house and a safe there. I keep there my paper wallets with bip38. In case somebody breaks in, they don't have the passphrase to my keys, so it would take them ~ a couple of billion years to decrypt it. In case I want to use them, I just scan and put in the passphrase and I can immediately use my bitcoins. In case I loose my wallets, I keep multiple copies at N trusted persons' houses that happen to live in different cities.
This is not compatible with 4S: If somebody breaks into my safe, they don't get my coins, so that's OK. But if I want to use them, I have to go and pick one of my secrets from one of my trusted persons.
Please let me know if I have any flaws in my reasoning or if you come up with another model that doesn't involve having a second trusted location.

They still can go against the business and make it very hard to use it. I don't think that will be the case in Argentina, but I have no idea about China. As for using it merely as a store of value, not as a common everyday currency, they sure will go against that. They can't stop bitcoin, they can try to stop people from legally using it.
We argentinians live every day with a ban on the dollar. It's not banned or illegal; but they make it hard to get and expensive.
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:22:57
Hmm, I'll try to be as concise as possible:
There are 3 kinds of bonds in discussion:
* A) Bonds that where in default and exchanged for new bonds with a haircut in 2005 and 2010
* B) Bonds in default possessed by so-called "holdouts" (people that didn't took a haircut on their debt and are now suing)
* C) Other bonds issued by Argentina
It boils down to:
* A-type bonds have a clause that says "we took a haircut, if you offer somebody else a better deal that you gave us, we want equal treatment"
* Some A-type and C-type bonds where supposed to pay dividends last month, and Argentina made deposits to pay those bonds but the bank said "I can't dude, this judge told me that I can't release your funds until you make up with B-type bond holders"
* This judge said "Argentina has to pay without a haircut. Go negotiate and come up with a payment plan."
* The clause that requires equal treatment is called "Rights upon future offers (RUFO)". The key word to look at here seems to be "offer".
* Now, this is to the best of my knowledge and may be opinionated or biased because of what I've been reading: If the judge would have said "Argentina, you *must* pay this way: deposit X amount of money in Y bank account", Argentina would have had to do it and there would be no default.
* Instead, the judge said "Negotiate the payment". That negotiation means Argentina has to extend an offer, which would trigger the equal treatment as they are "offering" some people to pay them without the haircut.
* Paying everyone without a haircut would really fuck things up (it's like 10 to 100 times more money, according to whom you ask), so Argentina is instead refusing to pay anyone until 2015, because the RUFO clause expires then.

It's extremely battery-intensive to run a tor client on your phone!
You'll run out of battery in a few hours.
What I suggest is setup tor in a server and setup a password protected SOCKS5 proxy.
But for that matter, you might as well just setup a SSH proxy. Take a look at the openssh client used with the -D option. 
There's an app for that, of course you'll need root:

Right now, there's no regulation, everything is working OK and cheap. It's actually a golden moment for bitcoin. You can get on board at your own risk... and if you get ripped off, like say you lost hundreds of coins at Mt Gox, it was because you trusted a lot of your money to some random stranger on the internet.


Sorry I got lost, who are "they"?


This is a crappy draft. I agree with you that there may be some benefit to regulating this industry, but I think that benefit is only for huge companies that already exist, and small companies will get a huge hit. The huge companies I'm referring to are traditional banks and multinationals. Any form of regulation similar to this is going to cripple any company based on bitcoin.
In short, as a starting point this sucks utterly.

They don't call it "ban". They just make it very difficult. It's not that they "hate bitcoin" or they want to "stop it before it's too big"; it's just that they are fighting a political war on tax evasion (here in Argentina), other politicians that are stealing more than they should (I think that's big in China), and capital fleeing from the country causing currency devaluation (both China and Argentina's case).
That's why they'll make bitcoin hard to use. And makes sense, there's no conspiracy against bitcoin; it's just that it affects certain interests and may be bad for macroeconomic indicators. "It's the economy, stupid"

Although I think it's good to educate people in general against trusting something just because it's big, I think Bitstamp is doing just fine and these complaints are exaggerated. Either way, I appreciate people posting about their problems. It helps to grow the overall level of professionalism and the amount of information about the offers available in the market.
Regarding "I was already authenticated but they asked again" -- it was known that there were multiple levels of authentication months ago, and if you're moving new money into them, it probably triggered their automatic "KYC level upgrade".

I realize that it was a bad idea, but the op is probably more concerned about being able to view pictures of kittens than anything else.

@_date: 2015-05-21 18:45:53
I'm afraid it's even worse than that: closing your tab will make you lose your bitcoins.
The server never sees the private keys, it never even sees the transactions involved or current streams.

I'm so glad somebody took the time to write this! You deserve three internets @_date: 2015-05-21 18:46:58
There's no relay service at the moment: you'll be limited by your bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:34:16
Sorry that you had issues! We're working on some details, like showing you the private key generated in case you transferred funds already but don't want to join the channel, and also make the change address optional... Follow our open source project on github: 
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:31:32
That's correct!

I define myself as an anarchist, and I would love your comments to be closer to reality. But you're full of wishful thinking...


They are allowed to steal from their population and their fellow countries that are their trade partners by debasing their currency.


That's an oversimplification. Big capital also goes to risky politics-protected monkey businesses in third world countries.


I predict this won't happen in the next N years. They may, as an experiment, start to hoard some bitcoins, but it won't be significant. People working in economic policy don't see bitcoin as a breakthrough technology, it's a small pond of technological innovation that doesn't provide any value. They are more concerned with it being used for money laundry.


That needs at least two or three generations. Politics is way more traditional than what you think.

Thanks! Esteban here, one of the devs of Streamium. The system has a few bugs so far; we are tackling issues as we see them. After the bugs (and adding persistence to avoid losing funds), chat &amp; preview are our first feature priorities :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:24:34
But it's the same as sending to newly generated addresses, adds nothing
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:51:36
That may not be good enough, transactions are still linkeable and vulnerable to "big data analysis"
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:59:13
Let me tell you a tale of stolen bitcoins:
* John got himself a good amount of bitcoins, let's say above 19 thousand of them.
* He's aware that some people may object that he spends them, as an internet community identified that he took them from somebody else due to a security mistake.
* So he starts moving his bitcoins slowly. He begins with small amounts, sending them to shady cryptocoin exchanges that only requires an email. He doesn't trust these low quality exchanges, but with limited exposure he's ok with using them.
* He buys himself some LTC, Darkcoin, Paycoin, Shitcoin and/or Titcoins, pumping them a little bit.
* He transfers those coins on whatever altcoin's blockchain he's using into another shady exchange
* He then sells the altcoins back for bitcoin, and transfers those bitcoins to untainted secure offline wallets.
* He's now tired of registering for all this, having different stuff on different coins, the kinda slow tor connection, the opsec involved, so he starts automatizing the process, and comes up with a script that moves randomly amounts of 20~30 coins per day. He may increase the variability of the amount, he may want to use different timezones for the buys and sells...
* Nobody rushes him, so he finishes his laundry after a year or so. And this community has no idea how did he get away, as I don't think you can detect this schema.
Good news, I don't think a three-letter agency has the capacity to do this analysis without compromising all the small exchanges
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:55:30
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:52:07
This doesn't look like serious journalism. What's the source for saying that it's the "final" filing?
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:11:08
Can't John try to use other accounts with existing balance and trade between accounts? I think that could break the link
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:20:04
This is actually not that complex and the automated bot could be boostraped in a week or so. Using different exchanges, new accounts for each transaction, different coins, different amounts, never reusing addresses, and splitting amounts, actually reduces the amount of info you're leaking.

We at bitcore ( are adding support to/from stealth. We've been playing around with it yesterday (sending to and from a multisig stealth address): 
We're planning to include it in our 0.9 release
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:59:32
Thrilled to watch it!
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:55:23
Thanks for the feedback!
(1) is a good point, we're thinking on making it optional and just detect the address from where the channel was fund.
(2): Safari doesn't have WebRTC :(
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:26:37
Under those constants it probably is good enough, but I wanted to share this other (kinda unknown) way of mixing coins.
It could be added into the mix and maybe use different strategies, the problem with that (as somebody mentioned in another comment) is that the weakest strategy of the ones you use may compromise your entire operation.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:02:26
Yep. And do that across different blockchains for an extra layer of untraceability.
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:37:56
Not at all, this would be totally symmetric. They could do the same as well.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:25:02
You sir are a genius, let me setup a tipbot account because you won a lot of internets 
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:24:55
stealth has nothing to do with this
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:03:14
But they are! They are the solution to posting an address in your hobby blog and allowing anybody to see how many donations you had, for example. They solve the inverse problem that BIP32 solves:
* With BIP32, you backup once and can generate a lot of addresses so you can communicate with somebody and ask him to pay to a known address of yours
* With stealth, you backup once and anybody can generate a lot of addresses so they can pay to you and they communicate to you through the blockchain that you are the recipient of those funds (and nobody else will know)
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:43:32
It's not weak, it moves the amount of information required to do the analysis from the blockchain (anyone can see it) into the exchanges (owners and governmental agencies can see it).
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:01:32
A "stealth transaction" is a set of two outputs: one includes information relevant to the receiver so he/she can identify that the funds correspond to him/her, and the other output is a simple payment to an address like any other.
My point is, it's the same as generating new addresses and sending to a lot of them, stealth has nothing to do with this.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:24:05


really? these get automatically created per user afaik




no it's not, you need to infer the linkeage and exchange rate used and much more
I challenge you if you're serious about this to do such a treasure hunt. I can simply send a bunch of small transactions to different ltc addresses and you'll never be able to link the amounts. In the same blockchain it's way easier because everything is linked
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:33:32
Thanks! I'll be in touch :)

He has 19 000 coins and a lifetime to try to spend them
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:57:21
No content is shared with the server. It's a static webpage with no changing content. There's no indexes of the "channels", so I don't think it would be an issue.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:01:48
bitcoinj's implementation of payment channels is way more solid. This is a slightly hackish implementation, with a larger attack surface from the start: a webapp in the browser is not as secure as an app running on your desktop.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:11:47
Alice: Let's run this, it provides more transactions per second!
Bob: But it might break.
Alice: I don't care about technical arguments
*shit breaks*
Alice: Oh no
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:16:17
Darkwallet is awesome, but you can still link the transactions, and afaik their coinjoin implementation only mixes between two parties (50% chance of detecting the party if it works correctly).
In the way I described above, John has untainted addresses as a result, and the coins came from totally unrelated transactions (funds of the exchanges he used), breaking the link.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:47:12
Doesn't show in other explorers. Maybe an attack on Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:44:48
You're not self-consistent. An increase to 4MB right now would lead to average ~10% capacity.

There's no right or wrong side. There are two alternatives, one might turn out to be too conservative and the other to be too radical. You're being disrespectful to at a lot of people that spent a lot of their time on this project, for your benefit and theirs too.

Yep, not showing up in any of my bitcoind nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:42:09
Hello there!
The BTC address shown when you're trying to join a channel is not the cashout address (because of how the payment channel works).
That address that you're seeing is the "Funding" address that we generate for your browser. It's always the same in case you funded a channel but decided not to join it, so you can use the funds later on a different stream.
When you close your tab you quit the protocol. "Come later" means "come back tomorrow", which is the time specified for the payment channel to expire.
As the technology is quite new, it's gonna take some time to mature the UX, but we're working on it!
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:59:49
Seems like an attack on blockchain.info. No inv data also, as pointed out by  (

Nothing in the white paper talks about the bitcoin scripting language. I'm remarking this to show you that no inclusion of a subject in the white paper doesn't mean that it shouldn't exist, or that it wasn't in Satoshi's mind, and also to make you aware that you are using an appeal to authority (blockchain science has advanced quite a lot since then).
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:32:00
Nope, just that things got really interesting. The "attack" on bitcoin is actually an attack between miners (if one has better hashrate/energy spent, the others earn less money and if there ever is a single minerthat has more than 51% of the hash rate, then yes, Bitcoin is broken, but that's not the case right now). The protocol and blockchain work just fine.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:23:01
I've written a comprehensive guide here of how would I "wash" bitcoins: 
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:03:32
Meh. It was an idea and I thought it may lead to something. Not trying to force anything. Maybe you got the wrong idea from "instead" on the title
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:04:02
Yeah I use bits also, but since a lot of people didn't like the term (I'm actually quite OK with it) I thought people would like it. Not changing anything, just talking
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:05:56
Because some people don't like the idea of naming 100 satoshis "bit". I'm ok with that but not everybody is.
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:44:58
Well, three and six months after the first and only bitcoin halving we had, price went from ~10 USD to ~30 USD and then to ~80 USD.

Hi everybody, creator here. Hope you like it :) It's quite fun to read this subreddit under this filter.

@_date: 2015-03-02 11:23:27
And the last time that happened, price stayed about the same for 6 weeks and then sinked :D
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:10:53
Trade volume is somewhat independent from price swings if offer and demand are somewhat balanced. You could trade one million bitcoins per day but have no price swings if there where 500 thousand buys and 500 thousand sells at the same price tag, but if somebody comes with a few extra bitcoins with unmatched counterpart the price could swing that way.
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:02:15
There are a bunch of servers that allow you to push transactions. Some of them are open source, like Insight ( --  a running instance)
There seems to be a pretty extensive list here: 
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:48:02
It's not highly available. "Commits" are not immediate, and depending on how much certainty you want to have, they can take up to 2 hours "to be settled".

@_date: 2015-02-13 10:59:17
Hi there! The examples in that same page should help. Otherwise, just use the playground and sample code gets generated for anything you do. To use bitcore you need a certain level of expertise with javascript and the node or the bower package system if you want to code for the browser.
Send me a PM and I'll be glad to help

Hi there! You can type in a private key, in either WIF or hexa format. Can you let me know how did you run into this issue?

I agree 100%. A split is a possibility but it would come with big consequences that we can't really predict. Interesting topic for a sci-fi novel.

Please tell me that the time has come and we are on the verge of switching to Namecoin and chainblock-stored public keys :D
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:42:18
I think it will come a time when changes to the bitcoin protocol will be too hard to implement, because politics. What if the chain block splits into two, as a mere example that I doubt would happen, a branch following a variation that allows redlisting and another one that doesn't. You would literally double your balance, being able to spend your coins from any of the two branches. Instability would follow, nobody knowing whichof the two blockchains to follow. Eventually, all bitcoin users would have to decide in between redcoins and whitecoins, possible names for the two branches. Or perhaps one of them disappears... I think it is not an easy problem to solve. TCP/IP, the previous decentralized protocol, had no similar issue because it was in the best interest of everyone to be able to intercommunicate. Perhaps, at the cost of stopping innovation, the time has arrived when no breaking change to the bitcoin protocol can be introduced -- and that may be the first crack in the vessel.
