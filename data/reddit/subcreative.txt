I &lt;3 Bitpay, in my opinion the most respected and open entity in bitcoin continually contributing amazing projects for us to adopt and use in our own ways.

Is what causing a problem? The fact that new users must download 20gb in blockchain data before they can use or run a full node using the QT wallet? Yes, that's what I'm asking.  I'm also trying to gauge if pruning the blockchain at this point in time would add any true file size savings or are we on a switch to a SPV driven network with limited nodes.
To perform a prune of a blockchain I guess you'd need to find a block height at which you want to remove all spent outputs prior (in my example 200k).  Removing possibly hundreds of thousands if not millions of spent outputs from the blockchain leaving ONLY UTXO (unspent outputs) would obviously be more efficient and faster to download for new users.

Would you be interested in accepted Cannacoin for your vapes/store? I am the lead dev and creator of the coin and I also run a shop for the coin here:  I would love to team up with you guys to help you guys accept Cannacoin or somehow collborate with the Cannacoin shop! I am personally a huge supporter of BTC and I truly believe that alt coins such as CCN can help contribute to the entire crypto movement. It's also obvious that our audience and coin caters hand in hand with cloud99 and I think it could be beneficial for everyone. Let me know what you think!
Looking forward to your response,

To answer some of your questions.
1)  At the moment we currently have a payment gateway for opencart and should have more for woocommerce as well as drupal, magneto and others soon.  It's good to know what you are currently working with so we can do our best to supply those needs in order for your store to accept CCN.
2) You're right that alts can be volatile however so can BTC or LTC.  To go along with our plugins we've designed a complete "cannapay" API that resembles the same merchant solutions that say Bitpay or others offer.  We are working hard to make this take this live and would easily provide vendors options for cashing out to BTC etc almost immediately. This should be live in a matter of weeks.
Thanks for taking the time to provide some insight from your end of the perspective, I will see if there's anything I can do to form a solution for Cloud99 and I'm sure we'll be talking soon :-D
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:49:37
Soon you should be able to do that with Cannacoin as well :-D

+1 let the chief take his role and strategize ways to increase the scale of our network!

I believe Joe was referring to his phone.  Andreas mentioned, he would send some BTC to his "Phone" and Joe then mentions "I dont know about that..." as if he was referring to lack of trust in his phones security to store his bitcoins.

Thank you all for the responses, I feel a bit better about the situation however I still think there are ways we can increase node adoption.  
Right now like mining, nodes are becoming a centralized/limited process due to the required resources and needs of the operator.  It seems that a majority are not concerned about this adoption because they expect growth of the chain to fall in line with increases in storage in bandwidth along with the adoption curve of the protocol.

I started Cannacoin in March 2014 to fill the needs of the Cannabis industry and am a firm beliver in the marriage of cannabis and crypto. I'm a developer and have built and have tools ready to apply to the industry, I encourage anyone interested to check us out on github  or join us on or  on freenode. I truly believe out of all the cannabis related coins we have the strongest, most viable network to succeed as well as some of the strongest development capabilities in the crypto community.   
I am also firm bitcoin supporter but feel that there are many advantages and needs that a network like Cannacoin can offer that Bitcoin and services like Bitpay who rely soley on Bitcoin can't offer the cannabis industry.
I'm excited to see this event and will see if I can't try to make it out or possible participate if there is opportunities.  Thanks for the link!

Sup Travis, it's Josh. Always good to see my childhood friends on :D

You should create a config folder and example for default.yml that way users cloning the repository don't need to create it manually.  Simply editing a pre-existing template would be more appropriate it seems... Ill take a look at the project and see if theres anything I can contribute, I've been working on a few side node projects over the past year or so that have accomplished some of these tasks but I'm always interested to see how other developers are approaching the solution.

Bitpay again for the win! I am consistently impressed with the development efforst by you guys! I watch the commits to bitcore on github daily and can tell there is truly a lot of work going on behind the scenes at Bitpay, keep it up!
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:22:48
You will need Node.js installed on your machine along with NPM (which should be included with the node install).  After that running npm install bitcore should get the package downloaded and from there your off to the races.

Thanks for the tip :-)
