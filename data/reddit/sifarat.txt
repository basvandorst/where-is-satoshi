Even thinking about it, makes me feel dirty. But since things can’t get any worse than this, let me please ask this. Is it mere coincidence that the creator of Bitcoin is of the same origin as the Mt. Gox. I am feeling guilty for asking this, and I would be pleased, if I remain guilty forever for asking this, than otherwise.

what about bitstamp, do you they pay fast? or take less time than Gox?
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:19:25
So you meant, Mt.Gox is risky. But my assumption above is valid right?

Can handle enough down votes.
Bitcoin is not a currency, it is at best a commodity, in our case let’s call it ‘virtual gold’. But again ‘gold the metal’ value is far more stable. Anyway just leave it at that. So let’s go back, when there was no paper currency, remember barter trade. And this is where, it is starting to annoying me, instead of moving forward, we are actually back to stone age. Indeed this is a harsh assessment of the Bitcoin. But sadly, it’s true.
So I am not going to buy an argument that would say, it’s innovative or nothing like this has happened in human history. In barter trade you can keep the same anonymity. If you have a gold biscuit, you can have same or even better anonymity than bitcoin promises. Because transaction regardless of known or unknown traders, would itself be anonymous or open between the persons who transacted.
Only difference in the case of bitcoins is, it’s an ‘internet barter trade system’. But question is why do we need it, it’s essentially a step back than forward. And just like ‘gold’ which has been the victim of speculation in the past few years, it will be too, ironically, ‘gold the metal speculation or hike in price’ was also credited to China. As they were stockpiling a lot of gold for reasons unknown. What if, this Japanese/US made ‘Virtual Gold’ is just a response to China’s actual stockpile of the ‘gold’. It’s a wild speculation, but you can’t rule it out., because almost everything here and there is ‘political motivated’ this way or the other. I guess China very much sensed it, hence banned it.
But even regardless of that, we should ask a question to ourselves, do we need an internet based barter trade system?. My clear answer is No. We should instead work towards, to make the currency transfer easier. Paypal was the first step forward. But we need a lot of more steps in this particular direction.
If you want to keep buying Bitcoins with a currency and vice versa, it’s not only ironic but also stupid. Or If you are a lazy bump, who can’t invest in a real business and work hard. Then you can choose various other commodities too, Hint! ‘gold the metal’. If you can’t sell it at a good price, at least you would make your wife happy.

isn't bitcoin a new branch of science in its own. ;)
