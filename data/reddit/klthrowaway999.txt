Nope, you've got it wrong.
Agent Force, as nob, had Ross arrange a cocaine sale for him. Ross delegated that to Curtis, who had the coke shipped to himself. Force and his team did a CD on Curtis, and Curtis talked  immediately in hopes of getting a deal. 
Curtis turned over his computer and passwords to Force, who passed those onto Agent Bridges, who then used Curtis'  credentials as a mod to reset a number of vendors passwords and steal the bitcoins from their accounts.
Inigo noticed this and notified Ross. Ross spoke to Nod (Force) and asked if he could send guys to catch Green and have him beaten up and forced to return the stolen Bitcoins. 
Ross then spoke to Variety Jones and Inigo and during the course of those conversations, decided that Green should be executed instead of just returning the coins, since they had learned of Greens arrest and were concerned that he could pose a threat to them. (How much of a threat would he have been, though, since he knew nothing about Ross? He just knew more about SR's infrastructure on account of having Mod prig's).
But anyways, after talking to VJ and Inigo, Ross then contacted Nod (Force) again and asked if he could upgrade his order from "torture" to "execute".
Yes. Force was involved in the action that caused Ross to want to execute Green. But that was hardly the intent. Yes, they had captured green. Yes, they had used Green's credentials to steal Bitcoins. 
No, they had no way of knowing that Ross would contact Nod, asking him to send someone after Green (whom Force already had in Custody - in fact, according to the wired article, Carl Force was sitting in a hotel room with Green when he received and email from Ross with a scan of Greens drivers license, IDing him as the person that he wanted captured). For all they knew, if Ross (DPR) was going send someone after Green, they had no way of knowing that it would be Nod who we would solicit for the action. And even after that contact, Nod did not make the push to change the order from torture to assassinate, that was the conclusion that DPR arrived at after speaking with his own counsel (Variety Jones and Inigo) - only after discussing with them, getting their approval (VJ actually said he would have lost a lot of respect for DPR had he NOT made that call, while Inigo simply agreed that that action could be in order), that he then re-contacted Nod and asked him to have green executed.
TLDR: You're spreading falsehood saying that Agent Force  was the one that came up with the idea of having Green killed. And thats the problem with so many Ross fans - so eager to see him free, they all seem to deliberately overlook the evidence which was released and is all a part of the public record. Chat logs galore, journal entries, all coming straight off of Ross's laptop

DREAD: can you change the order to execute rather than torture?
