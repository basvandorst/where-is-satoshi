That is not possible.  There are relative time locks so the cheated party always has time to claim the funds after the fraudulent commitment to the main chain.  There will even be light wallets able to monitor the relevant outputs for these fraudulent commitments.

It is anti-fragile.  Bitcoin's economic incentive will either forces Coinbase off the network (by user boycott) or force them to transaction efficiently.  This will not be in instantaneous but will happen soon.

LN is onion routed so hubs would only be able to observe the incoming and outgoing hop.  They have no idea if the routed payment is 20 hops long or 2.

"a rig costing 1.3M USD a year in amortized costs is sufficient to support terabyte blocks"...   At that point just use a database.  Both will be just as centralized but the database will be much cheaper and efficient.

Also, in the future, your employer could pay you through a lightning channel, refilling your channel, and thus avoiding an on-chain fee to rebalance.

This is not true. Only the settling transactions are published.  Nothing in between.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:56:43
Also, in a high fee scenario, increasing channel capacity by say, $10, becomes viable with coin join and schnorr since the fee is shared amongst many participants but the transaction size remains relatively small in bytes.   This is great since there is now a financial incentive to move toward more private transactions.
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:21:06
With multiparty channels, if one participant goes off line for prolonged period, others can still spawn channels off of the main multi-sig, all happening off chain.  If necessary, the multi-party can settle on chain, splice out the unresponsive party and reopen all in one go.  This can all be automated in the wallet to some degree.  No trust required although you may want to open a multi-party reliable nodes.  Shouldn't be too difficult with things like casa node, raspi bolt, raspi blitz, nodl, etc...  Don't forget you can coin join into a multi party channel which will further increase scaling with schnorr.

I'll keep it straight forward and simple.  The current inflationary debt based monetary system is the cause of most economic hardship today.  I'm not trying to parse whether the fault lies with the fiat money itself or "the state" who enforces the monetary system.  The entire setup is corrupt and faulty.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:11:05
Not convoluted?  The fed prints money whenever it wants (yes the treasury owns the press but the fed has control of the base money supply).  It then uses that money to buy government bonds on the open market.  To be clear the Fed loans the government money that was printed out of thin air!  It then turns profit on that loan and gives about 98% that profit back to the treasury keeping 7.6 billion(edited for 2017) for "expenses".  It makes no sense to fund the government by printing up money to purchase government debt and then paying yourself back from the interest payments.  How is that not convoluted?  Take a look at  and see how well that strategy is working out for us.  No president or politician can stop the Fed fueled debt beast.
You view money as debt and I completely agree when we are talking about fiat.  I view "sound" money as a storage of wealth and would much rather use that than the convoluted system we have now.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:37:35
I would argue it is a direct result of fed policy.  Money is created out of debt from the very start when the fed lends it to our government and other banks.  This guarantees that there will never be enough money to pay back the debt with interest.  Thus, the budget can never be balanced.  The student debt crisis is just one of the many tragic outcomes from the Fed debt lending policy.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:11:21
Let's say we wiped the national debt clean and started with a balanced budget.  Currently, the only way for the government to receive new money is by borrowing it with interest from the federal reserve through bonds.  The money currently in circulation is already paying off debt since that is how it came into existence through fed to bank lending, fed to govt lending, and bank fractional reserve lending.  This means we cannot count any of the existing supply as a possible way to become debt free.  Given that, how does our government ever balance the budget and become debt free?  By definition the debt will always be greater than the available money supply.  We need to face the realization that the current monetary system is an intricate and intentionally overcomplicated scam.

If economic majority agrees that Segwit is a sound improvement, but Bitmain is unilaterally blocking activation, then UASF is not hijacking anything.  It is simply bypassing the bad actors.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:02:53
Okay, so substitute gold for dollars.  It is still fractional lending.  It is still inflationary and unfair.  It drives the masses into debt by driving up prices due to an inflated money supply.  The current system is essentially a pyramid scheme.  The banks are the only ones benefiting while the masses suffer under crushing debt.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:36:48
99.8% at activation period 6.  If you don't believe the website then you can go on the block explorer and count the signaling yourself.  This percentage was stuck at ~60% for a long time.  It managed to eek near 70% eventually when F2pool started signaling.  Then Bitmain brought their asic scrypt miners on line and the number plummeted.  It wasn't until Charlie Lee struck an agreement with Bitmain did this number reach overwhelming consensus.  That is how much power Bitmain has over not just Bitcoin but now scrypt coins as well.  If you don't think this is a problem then you don't understand the purpose of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:07:02
So it is your position that inflated housing prices and subsequent crash in 2008 were not the direct result of over lending (i.e. increasing the money supply)?  Instead you blame zoning law, etc...?

2MB is a drop in the bucket for scaling but significantly increases node bandwith usage which is already at ~400GB/month for 100 connections.  Yes we can limit connections and SPV nodes are getting some love but we need to take this one step at a time.  Bitmain is blocking a sound technical improvement to Bitcoin purely because of politics.  This must not be tolerated or it represents a potentially fatal attack vector for Bitcoin.
By the way, anyone who tells me "Bitmain is not blocking SW, it still needs 95%" is not being honest with themselves.  Everyone knows that if Bitmain pools signal the rest will fall in line.  We saw this with Litecoin. 
 That is how bad mining centralization is...

You are thinking from the current overly complex paradigm.  Deflation is not a problem in a fixed supply system. Let the market correct itself and there will be no issues.  People can only hoard money for so long before they need to spend it on goods under a fixed supply.  Under the current inflationary system, the ultra rich will keep accumulating more and more wealth precisely because the supply is not fixed.  It is stolen from the less wealthy through fractional reserve lending.  It is set up so that the majority need to go into debt in order to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:49:16
That is all well and good if you are fortunate enough to have surplus income for investing.  Give that advice to a recent college grad who is already paying half a mortgage payment in student debt.  They live paycheck to paycheck as their purchasing power was already stolen by the inflationary debt machine.

I keep my (fiat) money in the bank.... With cryptocurrency we don't need a mattress or a bank and have better security.  If everyone is getting paid and transacting in a deflationary currency then it will be fine.  Just no more shenanigans with diversifying portfolios and investing to escape inflation.  Very simple.

At this point it is sad to say that a POW change should be at the ready.  Sucks for honest miners but we don't have many options left.  Even if UASF successfully overtakes the main chain it will be attacked for sure.  Bitmain wants control at all costs.

"... New money created through fractional reserve banking is perfectly legitimate though..."
Say I gave you a loan for 300 ounces of gold at reasonable interest.  Only, instead of giving you 300 ounces of gold, I gave you paper IOU's redeemable for 300 ounces at any of my "banks".  Oh, I forgot to mention that I don't really have 300 ounces of gold.  I only actually  have 30 ounces of gold.  I always loan out ten times the amount of gold that I actually have.  It works great for me!  So, if you ever want to trade those paper IOU's in for the equivalent amount of gold at my "bank" then I can probably only give you 30 ounces since I've lent out the rest of my gold at the same 10:1 ratio.  Just keep using those paper thingy's I gave you.  Also, keep paying me interest on that loan for the gold that I don't really have.  Opps, did I just say that out loud?  By the way, if you don't make your payments on time, I'll take your house as collateral.
Does the above scenario sound "perfectly legitimate" to you?  If it does then you must be a banker.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:12:13
I doubt it since Bitmain's suggested path goes against one of the core principles of Bitcoin - to remain decentralized and free from state control.  With centralized mining and full nodes, this will make Bitcoin highly susceptible to state control.  
(Edit) But, on second thought, maybe the influx of new users don't care or understand Bitcoin's purpose.  They may just want fast transactions at the cost of network security and risk of centralization.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:11:09
All of us would be for a blocksize increase if it didn't shoot bandwidth consumption through the roof.  We are trying to defend against node centralization by requiring specialized datacenters to run one.  Jihan wants mining centralized, nodes centralized (he publicly stated he wants data centers for full nodes), and now he wants control of development too.

I see you subscribe to the overly complicated system that we currently must deal with.  There is no need to play money games when we have a sound fixed supply currency such as Bitcoin.  With a fixed money supply you can store your wealth right there in the currency itself.  It will gain purchasing power over time versus losing it as in fiat.  That is the plain and simple benefit of deflation.  No more investing in stocks, commodities, bonds, assets, foreign currencies, etc... just to escape inflation.  With a fixed money supply you store your wealth right in the currency itself which will gain more purchasing power over time.  This levels the playing field for the average Joe just trying to make a wage and earn a decent living without becoming a modern day slave.  Try and give your same advice above to someone in Venezuela where they have capital controls.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:04:07
Why would it matter if prices of goods and services fall relative to the currency you are holding?  Why are you measuring deflation as being problematic based on the perspective of someone holding a loan? With a fixed money supply there would be far fewer loans since most people would not need to go into debt to secure their basic needs such as food and shelter.  You would not have situations where home buyers are under water because they bought at the top of a quantitive easing bubble.  This debt based system is a sin.  It is modern day slavery while the few reap the rewards of the sweat and hard work of the masses.  Fixed money supply such as bitcoin will level the playing field.  No more 30 year loans to buy a house.  People work and store their wealth in a non-inflationary currency which they then use to buy their house outright.  Stop regurgitating economics taught in universities where they brainwash you into thinking this system is just or even sane.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:33:34
Under a fixed money supply, it does not matter if your home value gets eroded.  You store your wealth in a sound currency.  That is where the fruit of your labor lies.  Not in some real estate that erodes over time...  You can't seem to get your head out of the old paradigm.  It's okay.  You will be awakened once this system is toppled by cryptocurrency.

Society is not debt based by choice.  The government forces debt upon us with overspending of our tax dollars.  The FED responds by printed more money causing inflation and buying the debt with that printed money to turn profit.  This in turn increases house prices and everything else. 
Average citizens are forced into debt.  That is a debt based system.  Don't forget the bank bail outs causing even further inflation.  The only ones required to actually balance their budget or face consequences are citizens.  Despite all this, many of us actually do manage to stay above water.  You blame society for debt and I blame the system as it is today.  When we were backed by gold inflation remained in check for the most part.
