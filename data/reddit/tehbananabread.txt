This time is different. I have a nasty feeling bitcoin will be down for a while. Hopefully im wrong
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:04:22
And its people like you who will be holding empty bags till they step into the grave. This whole shitshow is fueled by greed and the gravy train is about to stop at the last station
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:28:14
Perfect. All the tax evaders can use a small portion off their BTC on this!

This doesn't make it any more clear for me. So the blockchain is loaded up to heavy atm. So this is the solutions, all it requires is people to connect to others with the network and leave their channels open? Are there reasons for people to open and close their channels every time that could load up the blockchain again to heavy? Or can they just leave them open all the time? Load it up with 10 BTC and just buy everything you want. After 5 years close it down when you spend everything? But you need to be linked to everybody, who is gonna make sure that chain is linked everywhere?

Would it not be easier to scan it or something? (i've no clue how this normally goes, but making a photo seems weird? If its the norm i learned something new:P)

Literrly everyone that says bitcoin will keep going up is posting OP's image. I get your point though ;)
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:02:19
Let me explain it simple: Tether has been inflating the market HUGELY with their token. Pumping in "cash" each day. When they are getting slapped on their head this cashflow will stop. Suddenly actual people have dump in their own money to keep the current prices afloat. (demand / supply) and that my friend, is not gonna happen. Demand is wayyyyyy to low. Reality check: last year the market was worth 3,5% of what it is now. Its a long fall down for bitcoin if this shit goes down. And probably ETH will take its place. (And yes, every coin will get punched in the face bigtime, but BTC will get straight up murdered)

Its often the people with money that value the small amounts more. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:39:14
what is the treahold to go from one to another?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:37:25
relatable. But in the end its all relative. 50k in one year? dream money for me. allows me to pay away a chunk of a houde. 50k for somebody else; his start investment
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:39:40
Ow no, 1 hours of gains lost
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:47:08
If you cant calculate this yourself........wow. Yet here you are ready to invest in bitcoin. Dumb money coming in left and right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:03
Shittt, i should look into this better. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:43:25
missed opportunity for 12.345.678,-
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:49:20
From the top of my head i can already tell you this is wrong. 100 to 120 = 20% gain. 14,4 x 20% is more than 17
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:02
See a doctor m8t if you take 20 mins to piss. Unless shit + meme making. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:57:33
And the point is...?  (Hint, just because some pattern played out postive before doesnt mean you should follow it blindly again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:20
Its funny how this donation just became so much more since last 24 hours. ;)! Gj anyway. Even if it was only 1,- a coin its more than most give. &lt;3

Hahahahah, new, fresh content, def not posted 500 times last month. /s
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:12
I just got to know, who are you people that can dump 200k to an exchange. What age are you and where did you start capital come from? On topic: GL OP, should fix itself!
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:40:43
where do you get this info? link pleass :D! would love to read up on this
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:27:38
I like how you didn't provide the "correct" solution, since you know im right. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:35:30
is the question you use in the google search box for 400 points please
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:01:42
Never understand why people here get so much pleasure from others losing their money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:46
Can you actually store coins on Gdax or do you just buy the "share"?
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:52:34
No they don't. Stop trying to misguide people on newspaper articles. The title is a word of play to explain what the 4 intervieuwed people did (trow some bitcoins in your (checkout) basket). Nowhere they recommend buying BTC
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:18:15
Should have read this 3 days ealier. Managed to fuck up hard on my first crpyto experience. (Still in the green, but down ow so much of what could have been)
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:09:44
Wait do they owe bitcoin or money? Otherwise they can just hold it and be fine either way? Of it drops they just return the bitcoins. If it goes up they sell them and hand them over the money that they were worth before the price increase? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:50:29
can you clarify?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:54:17
Fair enough and nice analogy, thanks :) 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:12:26
My wallet is fine, my soul is not brother. (but i agree with you). 
Side note: managed to earn 15,- in 20 minutes with day trading today. Fuck yeah, new career path incoming!
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:59:23
Not to be a sour princess or anything. But 50k would 10 fold his investment. making it 500,-.......... People acting like he will earn life changing money. But all in all, you gotta start somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:13:45
Let me guess, neo ;)?
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:03:56
Just stop trying to justify crashes. The hole keeps getting bigger and still people trying to talk others into it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:55:25
Question: How would one go on about cashing out 1 million in bitcoins? What sites are willing to pay out hefty sums? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:04:52
No it is not. Everybody has different goals, needs etc. Stop guilt tripping others into holding cause you have chosen to do so 
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:14:19
Overpayed? hahaha. 4k to 12k in a few months. Gj on missing the point though. Bought in at 16,- sold at 19,5k rebought at 4k to increase my stack almost 5 fold. all the pro holders are still at 60% net worth of their ATH. Meanwhile im already x3 above my ATH net worth cause of stack multipliers. Selling high / buying the dip is worth it if you know what you are doing, and can RAPIDLY shoot you up in value. Having the balls to sell once and rebuying at a 33% dip already increases your holdings by 50%.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:44:19
Also this image makes no sense since doubt = negative. would not = negative. So you basically say that everybody was sure of the fact bitcoin would rise again.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:43:06
Meanwhile the real ballers sold at 19,5k and bought back in at 4k. But gz on holding
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:45:01
Fair enough, time will tell my friend! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:52:25
Comments like this are so uneducated. A person that is spending probably a lot of his time with crypto like OP is bound to brush of some to his family. Its called interest. 400k people on this subreddit. If they all bring in 2 people we are only talking about 1,2 million people. Its easy to find topics like this on a subreddit like this. When you find titles like this on random subreddits you know we are in a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:44:59
Cute. We are still in a downward channel. 4,5/5k = target. After that up we go (hopefully)
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:51:58
Who would have thought that the biggest holders in BTC spread bullish news about the coin. Mind boggling!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:45:36
I saw BTC price at 12 cents while sitting in college. Never bought in those days cause to confusing. Missed out on massive gains......... While speaking, i also should have bought apple stocks when i was a toddler. Life happens, every day there are new chances, dont beat yourself up over old mistakes. (Heck trust me, i can know. Not a day passes by that i regret going to the club once and getting tinnitus (permanent hearing damage / ringing in ears. Even when i hated to go out and rarely did, i pulled the lotterly ticket there.)
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:41:08
10,- a day on cigarettes wtf? thats like 2 vacations a year. (still GJ op for making stuff happen)!
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:43:26
I dare people to look at LTC history and tell me they have the balls to hold a crypto that is bleeding out 95% of its value over 3,5 years before going up again
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:45:13
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:36:42
What exchanges allow you to keep fiat? Def not bittrex right? (if so i missed that o-O?) 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:47:24
It makes me proud that within a month i learned so much about crypto that i can understand the title and writeup
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:45:47
Trezor or ledger? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:49:53
I actually had the idea to buy an bitcoin ATM and put it down in my city. What would i need. (Besides a shitton of bitcoins?)
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:42:45
If you think more than 10% of the people that are investing in bitcoin care about the technology behind it i have bad news for you....
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:51:01
You are ignoring the main point on purpose ... right? Im questioning why people keep littering reddits like this with their low effort youtube videos. Do you really think these are the videos people are gonna base their desicions / knowledge off? Every time crypto gets some traction most of the forums / reddits etc. become a dumpster. But GL in your YT endavours. At least you dont have to make a living out of it since you bought BTC at 10,-
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:25:31
Uhghhhhhh, like we need more of these channels. Do people reallly take people like this serious? No offense, but like still.....yeah
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:10:49
Kinda matches your crypto knowledge I would say?
But for real. All i"m trying to say is: Do you really think people on this crypto sub are waiting for more 20 year old ex video gaming addicts, with 0 trading skills and experience post links to their youtube channel where they do their "indepth" crypto talk? I understand crypto is exciting and feeds right into the fast reward style of current video games,  (Get rich quick with crypto! Buy useless altcoins. Maybe you are lucky) but it just doesnt cut it. There is no added value in videos like this. Dime a dozen. Copycats of copycats. Either adapt and be unique or actually truck over people by showing them your successes. This video has neither.
