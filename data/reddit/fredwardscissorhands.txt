Can you explain the attack in detail or link to a thread that does? I understand motivation of bcash supporters to attack BTC, but I would like to know how to spot an attack and how it works exactly.

The FUD is strong with this one... buying weed for 100BTC 5 years ago doesn't count as "losing millions"

Bitcoin is an unregulated marker. The BTC market can therefore be manipulated freely without any legal consequences

Can you ELI5 this for me please? The wall represents sell orders of ppl cashing out at 10k€, correct? Once those 100 BTC have been bought up by someone, the sell wall is considered "destroyed", and we can go to the moon?

By fake support, do you mean fake buy orders?

What I would like to know is how this wall compares to what other walls looked like at various other milestones.
