insurance - so a private company is writing insurance on my bitcoin storage.  what does that cost?  is it more or less than what we pay in taxes to the FDIC?  and what's that private companies credit rating?  if they insured 100% of the mt gox funds, would they still be around today? 
i hear you on the FDIC.  i was simply trying to say that even though we do pay a small amount of tax on it, consumers have a lot of protection.  even if the feds have to step in to bail out the FDIC.  we've probably come the closest we will see in our lifetime to that happening during the financial crisis.  
on the inflation front... that's only if someone wants to buy your bitcoin at a higher price.  right now as a store of value, it's not not a shining star as it might have been looked at a couple of weeks ago given the news.  
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:23:26
sure it's related.  the FDIC has the backing of the full faith and credit of the united states government.  i brought interest rates into the mix to explain exactly what that means.  the entire market sees the full faith and credit of the US government as risk free.
i get no government protection for *using* dollars,  but i get a *shitload* of protection when storing them.

yeah, you're right.  credit card companies have been slow to realize the huge flaw with their transaction network.  i think it's going to change and we'll see a shift to chip and pin like in europe.  there is no reason to send that information over a wire for each thing i buy.
i do think bitcoin is interesting and i'm hopeful that it creates a way to send money more fluidly around the world.  i honestly don't understand why one coin is worth $600 though... other than the hype.  the limited in nature argument doesn't really sit with me since there are so many competitors.  and the news has been pretty bearish in terms of getting the marginal buyer of coins interested.  why would a new person want to put their money into coins after reading about $500 million of them stolen.  even if it wasn't the protocol, the average person just won't care or take the time to understand it.
always good conversations on this forum.  i enjoyed our chat!

1. months?  my merchant account verifies and deposits into my account the very next day.
3. i can store my dollars in a bank and i have $250,000 in FDIC protection that they will be there.  i also do not have to worry that someone is going to hack my physical leather wallet because i'm not changing my password daily.  i do however, take robbery risk each time i leave the house, but i keep most of my money in FDIC institutions and actually have my company make a direct deposit of cash to them.
neither 1 nor 3 are answers to the concerns presented by the original poster.

i don't take checks.  don't even know what a double-bounced check/transfer is...  and to my surprise, never had a chargeback.  but when i do, the company is responsive and i'll be able to prove delivery of the good, so i'm not concerned.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:34:48
it's much more likely that bitcoin goes under before the US dollar / FDIC does.  i'll take that bet any day in any size you want.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:42:16
he said "You don't get consumer protection from the Fed when using dollars" and that's simply not true.  Independent or not "deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government."
the united states government for all intensive purposes is considered the risk free rate of return.  he entire market based system around the world operates on this premise with billions and billions of dollars each day transacting using that risk free rate as a benchmark.

look, i hate credit cards.  they take a lot of money away from someone selling a good online.  2.75% and up.  
i have a coinbase merchant account and i'd love for that to take off since it's cheaper to transact.  that's where i'm bullish on coins... lowering transaction costs for everyone involved.  banks, credit card companies and money transfer services are ripping people off.
i'm not a bitcoin bear, but i think this subreddit is a bit ignorant to the risks associated with the market.  i have no idea why bitcoins should be trading at ~$600 each.  they're incredibly volatile, they offer no real store of value (that i can see) and there have been some massive MASSIVE breaches in terms of security for users.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:52:59


what does that mean?
how does bitcoin stop inflation?  why can't the value of bitcoin stay unchanged and the prices of goods and services per bitcoin go higher?
don't you think if bitcoin catches on in a big way that governments will tax it?  japan said today they were looking at a transaction tax.  that might be additive to VAT for the good or service which means it would cost even more to use bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:56:53
so it's purely technical?
is there a fundamental reason you think bitcoin should go higher? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:46:36
as more and more people transact that inherently brings more buyers and sellers.  the liquidity in the market goes up as transaction volumes increase.
as long as the velocity (number of daily round trip transactions) keeps increasing then theoretically the price of each coin never has to go up.
ultimately, over time, if it becomes an accepted "currency" the volatility of the asset should converge to average volatility on other major world currencies... which in today's market is roughly 10% for the majors.  so 10% average price volatility every year.

a nice bounce off your levels!  nice work.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:20:27
he's averaging down.  what's better, buying it all at $226 or buying clips of it as the price goes lower?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:37:43
nice.  a ~5% portfolio bet.  well proportioned to your overall net worth.  just make sure you're disciplined and don't keep spending all of your wealth on it if it goes lower.  basically, set a maximum amount of your worth that you are going to bet and make it a hard stop.  if it's $40k or $50k... i don't think you should go much higher than 8%.
good luck!!

i want bitcoin to work because it can help consumers save on transaction costs for items around the world.  the issue i have had with this sub is that does not necessarily mean higher prices for bitcoin... it means a higher velocity of money, which can offset the inflationary pressure.
so i'm a believer in bitcoin, but not necessarily a higher priced bitcoin...

worldwide attention for something losing 50% of its value overnight isn't a good thing
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:05:03
i think it's an honest assessment of the risk reward.  he's 100% right about it being an uphill battle.  regulation is bitcoin's worst enemy and has the potential to make the recent drop look like a blip on a longer term chart...
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:35:50
Should I leave my balance in coinbase or should I transfer it to a block chain wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:47:23
the estimate for the end of mining is year 2,140, so that's a pretty long time before there are no more payouts from mining.
in terms of currency usage, as long as long as the velocity increases (more and more transactions), there should be no problem having a limited quantity of coins in place.  theoretically, inflation (prices going higher) becomes an issue if the velocity of money does not increase.
as a relative comparison, i guess you could think of it like gold.  while we are not certain how much of it exists on our planet, the total amount of mined gold right now can fit in one big room (can't remember dimensions, but it's not huge).  but gold is actively traded.  it's a large deep market with billions of dollars trading on an exchange each and every day.  
so summing it up, having a finite quantity of coins shouldn't make much of an impact as long as it becomes much more widely adopted.  that's the key.  with that, it should create more liquidity and relative stability (less volatility)... i have no idea what that makes coins ultimately worth... but i think the concept is disruptive enough and worth a small allocation in my overall investment portfolio.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:07:29
harsh... i see no harm in taking some profits.  given his wording, he seems much more aware about the risks to bitcoin than the average person who responds to comments on this subreddit.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:13:03
it's still early days here.  i think to become accepted it is going to take time.  a long time actually.  
most people have no clue what bitcoins are but know what the USD, euro, pound or japanese yen are.  so the community needs to work on building awareness, and hopefully that comes along side stability for the coins.  a liquid trading market is important.  
the other problem is security at the moment.  i know my money is safe in the bank.  i can't say the same about bitcoins at the moment.  there are too many stores about people breaking into accounts, making transfers of wallet balances and total loss for the user.  
i'm long coins.  not much, but i do think it's a great concept that has the potential to free individuals from excessive banking fees (especially on FX transactions) and merchants from excessive merchant account fees (2.75% per credit card swipe).
in my opinion, the risk reward was good enough to put a very small part of my overall portfolio into this new, internet developed, 100% speculative (potential) currency of the future... while fully understanding that there were significant risks to my investment and that total loss was possible.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:42:54
i'm going to get ripped but whatever.
every single one of them that exists is pure speculation, including bitcoin.  they're all concepts.  and not without flaws.  the market sets the rate and three years down the road who knows what any of them will be worth.
calling litecoin a "speculative experiments at the margin" is a bit ignorant of the fact that it's exactly what all of them are...
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:49:15
it's a great question.  and the answer is they wouldn't!  it's no where near a safe / secure store of value.  right now i view coins as 100% speculative with a very small chance of them changing the way transactions occur online.  
but the key component to this actually happening would be developing a large, deep, liquid market that allows individuals to have confidence that if they buy coins they will fluctuate like any other foreign currency out there... which is to say they move, but they provide relative stability.
my (admittedly harsh) comments above used the word currency because i guess that's my bullish scenario for bitcoins...  that they become an active medium of exchange for goods and services via the internet and with that we see a deeper liquid market that is relatively stable.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:35:31
how did the transaction get linked to this reddit post?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:09:14
other than china blocking where 63% of the demand came from, the US treasury warning businesses accepting bitcoin about legal responsibilities, the EU warning people about the speculative nature of coins, and Denmark drafting regulation around them... nope, nothing changed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:44:56
i agree with you.  he just got a lot of free advertising
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:08:22
this is fucking ridiculous.  the super bullish bitcoin community that would downvote or ignore posts about regulation being the biggest threat to the currency is now on suicide watch because coins went from 1k to $500.  it's still up a shit ton.  
stop being babies, man the fuck up and realize that you're playing a speculative asset and if you lost money, well, you failed to calculate all of the potential risks of your investment and you're out some cash.  level your head and determine if you should stick with your investment or sell and get out.  it's a trade.  remove the emotion.  
i'm sheltered in place for my downvotes.
