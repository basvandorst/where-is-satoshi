hey people, game programmer here :) I noticed some reddit traffic and brought me here. 
on the first click you get 1.5x your money, you lose on average 10%. and there are some small differenes due to rounding.
someone made a table of payouts here
the reason for I do this is to be able to support my referal system. I don't advertise and don't feel like going into that.
the person that refers a user earns 10% of that users losses, so in that scenario, the game is unbalanced towards the house, but the house doesn't keep those earnings.
my reasoning is that paying less to people for refering is going to make refering unattractive, and paying more without changing the odds will make the game exploitable by using two accounts.
I'd gladly readjust anything if someone has a better idea.

None, you can play as soon as the bitcoin daemon on my side registeres a payment. which is usually within a minute. 5 confirmations are required only when you want to cash out the winnings

hey, site dev here, I'd be grateful if you told me which browsers you have problems with. I'm aware that internet explorer fails with it, but others should work. actually, I'd like to get comments about anything.

hey, can you please give me any info by which I can locate your user/payment so I can check it out and fix it?

by quick inspection, I see that your balance is, as it should be, 0.0898 btc, I'm investigating if there was some kind of glitch.

there are tons of bomberman clones, I think the game is in public domain by now?
not really sure, maybe I'd need to change the graphics a bit to be in the clear.
