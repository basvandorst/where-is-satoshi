It is your duty to know things, and not mine. You didn’t started conversation in a proper way, mate. So no rebuttal for you. You started in an aggressive way, telling me I don’t know anything. If you know everything I don’t need to give you a knowledge;)

Ok. You say, you know the things. Which one is the first distributed ledger, blockchain technology, running officially? Then we talk :)
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:25:39
Let’s be honest. Drugs were selling with dollars as preferable currency. There are some 0.00000001% of all the drugs in the world bought with digital currencies. There is no sense in buying illegal things with currencies that are very good in leaving trace of the transaction for as long as it exists. 
Whoever wants you to believe crypto is responsible for a drug related problem is actually using USdollars. ;)

I see... You are just curious. 
Bitcoin is complicated ecosystem. If governments accept it as legal payment method, fiat is going down. If fiat goes down, governments and banks too. They don’t know what it is. How you pay tax on something that is not in any law? They even ban it in some countries. This puts it in one category with drugs. Who pays taxes for drug trafficking? :D
This is the Bitcoin paradox...
This is why I said, your bank will advise you.

You have point. The fees are very high. It could be space rental price, could be greed, or uncertainty of the future of crypto currencies and the desire to return investment in no time, because of lack of regulation, which gives some sort of certainty. 
If you ask me, it is because of uncertainty, and the high price of ATMs.

Everything is fine with me too. But when you respect other’s opinion, don’t state that you don’t care about it. You state that you don’t like only. There is a huge difference. 
And it really sounds like targeted FOMO, cause you ask for the uptrend only, and you don’t need the downtrend. Looks like it doesn’t fit in a certain agenda. Word “care” is not equivalent of “like”. ;)

@_date: 2018-09-17 11:25:35
Could be true. Since the technology behind has been discussed in the late 80s for the first time publicly online, it is plausible. And there are numerous projects by governments in this area, there was lots of heat bout it, could be also combining different ideas in one. Which is also a lot of work. Crypto currencies are just a way to pay for supporting a project and increasing computing power. 
Everything is possible. I really can’t tell which is the truth behind. Just speculation. :)

I fully agree with you. My post is about finding another way. Binance and Coinbase are essentially banks. This is why I like the idea behind BCN. Huge volume and has properties like fiat.

Thank You for the reply. I was reading an interview with Alex Kruger just now, and he express the same concerns like me. The Bitcoin market is vulnerable to manipulation and is unregulated. Which will probably push back the decision towards deadline in 2019.

First of all, you are talking about the protocol responsible for implying rules on miners. Not who is giving the tasks to be solved. It could be random to you, but does it means it really is...
If you think this is the answer, then fine. 
Then if someone talked about it 10 years before it appearance, means only one thing... It takes 10 years to develop, beta test and so on before public release.

I will give up vote to everyone here. Respect to different opinions is a must. 
My opinion is that the banks knows that can’t stop it. And will try to put hands on it. 
Real price up will come, when people start trade goods for bitcoins, litecoins, bytecoins. It won’t come from banks. And they will loose their control over people’s life in time gradually. No need for ETF, legislation, regulation or them say even a word. The only reason they didn’t banned it still is that it will unveil their weaknesses against things they can’t control, which will lead to their full collapse. 
Let’s be honest. Now we use banks to buy, sell crypto. They still have control over it. And this why they do not afraid. But when you can buy more goods with it, they will crash hard. 
The only way for them to avoid it, is to have control over it. 
Where I get it wrong?
And please, if some of You do not have the same opinion, do not give down vote. We all have the right to express views, feelings. People needs to feel free about these things. I see someone is giving downvotes. Thank you all.

Can’t tell you. Taxing is only when you go from Bitcoin to cash. Better ask for advice in couple of banks. They will give you all the info you need. 
Guys here sometimes are sarcastic and full of jokes, because they hodl. No hard feelings at all, trust me. Just a type of society like medics, geeks have own way of joking.

And you gonna loose my grandmother pension. My money for retirement. What good will you get out of it? You make money the scam way, like the banks. Institutional money are the money of the people in every country. You won’t steal their money. You won’t take your bankers yachts. And after you will have to pay through the same institutions more money to cover loses. And the banks make more money with taxes. 
Don’t see what I have to get, except paying more money to the same “people” and buy more expensive yachts for them. Do you understand what the reality of your view is?

Guys, you have very bad and wrong attitude towards different views. You just have narcissistic traits to the max. Bad childhood or what? 
Bitcoin is going down now, fact. And you put all of your anger toward people that said it before. Why? 
Bitcoin doesn’t need you advocating. Bitcoin doesn’t need angry people like you.

If it is not declared illegal, doesn’t mean it is declared legal. There is a certain way the law works. But if it is declared legal, means that they state it is the same as fiat. Big difference in it. I finished law in my country. It is in the grey area still

Yes. Is it serious question? Legal as commodities is strange as legislation at all. If it is not illegal, then it is legal. If you mean the exchange way, then yes. But here the discussion is not about details like it. It is about does it need such legislation at all. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:41:50
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:07:32
Bitcoin is not legal even now. It is more like in the gray area. I am not playing anything. It is not illegal also, because if they make it illegal, they don’t know what will happen. 
We, the people. Yes banks are made of people. But the same people that makes the banks had robbed the worlds economy. And for their mansions the “other” people paid. 
It is interesting to have different opinions. This is how we change our views. 
I am not working in bank. I own just a fraction of an ether. 
And everyone has the right to express their views. This is mine. I won’t be harsh to anyone here. The same people were sanctioned from Department of Justice for taking illegal actions against majority of US citizens. Am I wrong here?
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:51:36

Gold can’t be hacked, can’t be destroyed by a Electomagnetic wave from the sun. What if there is key for destroying the whole network? Like a kill switch? What if the whole idea behind is to take people’s money, so they don’t have the power to rebelled? 
Some statements are just not enough. Why you think it is so better than gold or diamonds, or silver? 
Most electronics are vulnerable to EMPs. The Sun is the biggest one around. There were power surges in history. Imagine a bigger one.

There are lots of banks that charges extra fees around the world. 
I think U.K. is crypto friendly. There was news that Coinbase opened account with Barclays. 
Maybe there is lot of interest in atms, this is why fees are that high. 
How does it sounds like 3-4% on buy and 4-5 on sell? Whould you use it with that fees?
Mind that selling your bitcoins to atm is connected in locking money inside it. And of course there are other governmental taxes connected with this sort of business. 
Edit: there is also the price of the machine. It will become obsolete if banks decide to switch only to digital money or crypto. Running service also cost money, employees, support, money collection. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:03:56
If you check the fees you pay with cc or dc, you gonna see that 3-5% is nothing ;)
If you check how much most exchanges charge you to deposit small amounts of fiat and then you have bank fees too. The best about atms is that you see a fee, and you pay the exact one. Not hidden like most banks charge you. Like couple of American banks that right now have legal issues with it. Don’t you get it, they are scared of losing control? At least your post is lame. Banking troll?
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:43:40
Ok, if you purchase with cc what amount of fiat arrives in your wallet. Did you tried to calculate it? Then you have to submit personal data to exchanges. They have to approve you. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:36:50
There are other methods to stay 100% private. Due to the nature of it, can’t reveal details. Just keep in mind, that 99.99999% of advertised networks are not private.

Do Bitcoin really needs to play by their rules? They create the rules. The core idea behind decentralisation and Bitcoin is the opposite of their game. Mass adoption will come after the next crisis in banking sector. And it won’t be late. ;)

Yes it is correct. Fully centralised and Bitmain announcement about the IPO in the States. Hmmm. Some huge projects on the table in south states, price manipulation to buy more and cheaper. Where it will end, can’t tell. But it won’t be decentralised anymore, won’t be free of rules.

No one can give you a good advice. Except we have here a huge insider. But we don’t. So do what you feel and think about it. There will be a change to digital money for sure. But no one can tell you which blockchain will be used. 
So I would tell you to make an extensive research. Compare the advantages of different types. 
Now it is a good time for a decision. Either you close with funds lost, either you stay with Bitcoin, or switch to a better project according to you. 
Good luck, my man. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:26:51
Thank you for understanding me. My opinion is that Bitcoin doesn’t need institutional money, because they are our money, but someone makes decisions instead of us. Pointing 2008 and the crisis is just that. We have the right to decide where our money goes. Not some “big players” in their shiny office on top of the world. 
I don’t state they are bad people at all. But if they hold our money, at least ask ordinary people on their opinion about investing pension funds.

It is a matter of time and acceptance. They will start to offer discounts. If you are a seller and bank charges you between 3-5% to operate your POS, and Litecoin charges 0.40$ in miner fees to transfer 90milions$. There are also projects already testing to store your daily profit offline and by the end of the day to send it with one transaction. Imagine this huge opportunity to save from bank taxes. 
Don’t get me wrong, I am not against banks, I am just PRO optimisations and PRO benefits to the society. Happy people, works better, are more creative, lives longer and pay more taxes, less crimes, because they are happy ;)
They deliver more to society. And imagine the opposite.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:56:01
And how much your bank charges you? Maybe your bank is PRO crypto currencies. Most banks if they even sends money to known crypto exchanges, charges extra fees for this. Have to check your bank balance after purchasing.

The price on the screen is what you get for your money. Simple check with exchange will give You perspective on fees. Of course there are fees, don’t you know how it operates? If you want to buy em yourself, then you have to pay fees too. SEPA/Wire/CC all of them have fees to deposit on an exchange. Then you have fees on exchanging fiat to crypto too. Don’t be lazy, research, make calculations before accusing something is fraud, if you don’t understand the advantages and see only disadvantages. ;)

US shares 50/50 the responsibility with Chavez and Maduro. They know exactly what they do and what is the price. When kids are starving and dying, there is no good cause.

@_date: 2018-06-14 21:23:59
Both are price manipulation. Holding drives the price up, makes it overvalued. 
No it is very important if you are just speculating with the price, or you use it as it was intended. To replace bank’s issued fiat. 
If you want to discredit a good idea, make it useless because of price volatility. 
I do support crypto currencies. I lend my gpus. The same way I did for SETI I am supporter. I am not speculating with a good idea. I have respect for it. Why you buy cheap and accumulate? If you are so true supporter, then buy and give for charity. Simple. 
Banks are suppressing the whole idea. Isn’t it obvious around the world? Banks refuse me to buy crypto currencies and use it instead fiat.

No hard feelings I suggest. We live in a free world and everyone has right to have opinion even wrong one. 
I hope that everyone here agree that price volatility is bad for mass adoption. Basically bad for the future of bitcoins and all the idea of money free of control. Because of price manipulations and this crazy rollercoaster price.

On contrary my man. I am asking only relevant questions. This is well known strategy that both sides use. It is one team. One goal. Discredit a good idea. You hold, then dump and buy lambos. Different approaches, one goal, one reason. Nothing useful for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:05:41

Investing in a project is always risky even for experienced traders or investors. Especially in the crypto sector there are a lot of potential for scam or pure bad business plan. 
Rules and regulations are basically good things, of course could have illicit use.

No it was created as an alternative to fiat. It was meant to be used, not abused. When you hold, you drive the price artificially up. It real value comes from using the way it was created

Exactly my point. Use it to exchange goods. Not store it. The house example is not appropriate. Property is a store of value. Currencies are meant  to exchange goods. 
Did you sold at higher price and bought cheaper? 
I am not lying. I did it. I had to see the dynamics behind and know what makes the idea looks bad. 
You know what I found? It is greedy. 
Open any economic textbook and try to find market price manipulation. Guess which one is on place one? Hold. 
Cheers guys. Thank you very much to enlighten my perspective on that matter. 
I really appreciate your opinions. 
I do not judge. I understand very well all that drives people greedy. I am also human.

The idea of blockchain is very old and very good one. IRC just started. IoT was in its infancy as an idea. 
The idea of crypto currency was already born and was taking heavy discussions around irc channels. But everyone knew back then that we needed faster network in order to work properly. Back then emails were arriving the next day from US to Europe. 
But now even the man that sells me my cigarettes everyday started to give advices on crypto currencies. 
Just a my “lame” tip. When you make exit strategy, just make it less greedy. Otherwise you will end like millions in the dot.com bubble. Better less profit, than full crash. The worst part of HODLers is their “hope” for reversals. Even back then in the dot.com time, many people still hoped. And didn’t believed the fall. And lost all of their investments. And guess who did profit? And the next bubble, who made profit and gives them salaries in millions every month? And where retirement funds vanished? Sorry, guys but I respect eldest. They built the world we live in. And if we want to make it better one, we need to respect the eldest first. The way we treat them, the way we are going to be treated. 
And now the hope is gone. Too many greedy people on a good idea. It was intended to rise value with it mass adoption. Steady, stable currency with mass adoption. This is where the real increase in value had to come. 
Just to say. Gold was 100 time cheaper than iron very long time. The people couldn’t use it to make tools. It didn’t fed their kids. This why it was used to make an exchange medium. 
We people give meaning and value of money. 
I am not pro or a troll. I just lived enough and didn’t forgot.

Using it for paying at shops, bars etc? 
Are you serious? Hahaha
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:09:48
That hodlers are basically shorting when they have opportunity. Both are price manipulation. 
Do you want to make money out of price or you are saying that you put money in the project and will never cash out? Do you support the project by lending you computational power? Or just put your money and hope to make fortune?
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:17:01
It is possible on unregulated market. And YES it will be profitable. But you need more than 100mil for top crypto currencies.

I am giving upvote to everyone. Discussion is where truth could be found. I see someone gives me downvote, because doesn’t like my view and has hard time facing opinions that doesn’t like. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:25:07
Just wrong? Do you have facts to sustain your point? 
Does the both parties makes the price swings so much and prevent mass adoption? 
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:35:15
They just bought it around 100 USD or less. They didn’t trade. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:05:38
The best about Bitcoin is that it is free for everyone. Holding or shorting the market are the two sides of one coin. Both are type of market manipulation. Both are bad for the project. The best is to use it on purpose. You use it as an alternative to fiat and corrupted banks. 
Correct me if wrong. You want a Lambo. You want to drive the price up, then dump and live a rockstar life. So you speculate the price by shorting the supply and inflate the price. You are just greedy. And you give the same bad name to the free money as your mates, the shorters. 
We see through you, guys. 
Why don’t you used it on purpose? You pay things with it. Both of type speculation are withholding the mass adoption. Which is really scary for the corrupted banks. Does it rings a bell of any sort? You help banks this way. But it is your way. Good luck
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:01:21
But eventually when price goes up high enough most decides to cash out, yes? And later buying cheaper? So hodlers are basically shorting the markets? What is the difference?
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:50:04
Well it’s just an assumption. I don’t know crypto millionaires, but I know couple of 100k USD owners in crypto and no one is trading. In fact I know couple of guys that lost a lot in trading.

Cable only. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 12:33:48
All wireless communication is not 100% secure. This applies to cable too, although it needs very expensive equipment to detect weak electro impulses at a distance. 
But definitely cable connection is way more secure.

Nice. :) May I ask for your nationality roots. In US there are so many people. Just curious which nationalities are more in crypto currencies, and which of them are more likely to cash out when it is reasonable. Thank You in advance.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:18:18
You are talking about teenagers. They want to look like their favourite celeb. I am talking about real adoption. There are lots of offers online to pay with crypto for 10% or so discount. 
And if you can’t hold your savings safe, then we are away from adoption. :)

There is an easy way. For example Freewallet is easy, transactions between users of the app are free and almost instant. I am not saying that this is the best app, but more like it are a good solution. Lightning is a very cheap option. Integration of lightning in a wallet like Jaxx and Freewallet would boost the usage

It is also odd that Coinbase changed their policy just a week before the pump. And removed stop loss. Also removed the zero fee for makers. And then boooom. Profit from the fee, then no stop loss will be triggered. ;)
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:21:02

Possible connection, yes. But since HitBTC uses custom made processors for their machines, they don’t has backdoors like Intel’s and AMD’s.

Chinese refused their currency to be linked to Russia’s petroleum. Europe is in the same ship as US. So they can’t avoid sanctions for now. Bitcoin is not an option at all. Maybe some privacy coin could. But since NSA stated last year that they can track at least 80% of Monero’s transactions it would be useless too. 
It would be interesting to see how they will manage to go around the sanctions. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:40:09

IMO, crypto is the best way to track money movements. So if they want to avoid sanctions, would need to find another way to get paid for LNG and petroleum. So basically this news don’t change anything. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:53:25
They can use gold instead. Or platinum, silver, stocks or anything else than crypto. Their intermediate currency could be banned, tracked, or any other sort of actions against it. Also most of exchanges would face some sort of regulations, so they face the same sanctions. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:19:01

@_date: 2019-05-06 12:46:29
I see you don’t understand financial system in details. SWIFT is a type of crypto currency, which is centralised.
Fiat is not all printed money. So btc is not printed at all, except paper wallets. But there is nothing backing up bitcoin. Fiat is backed up by people, people’s work, creating goods. So basically btc only uses electricity, nothing more. At least they can use this massive calculating power of CRISPR os some other creating purpose.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:01:33
I don’t want btc  I like it just the way it is. :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:18:31
I agree with you man. I remember when btc was said to be private and untraceable. So most of drug dealers used it on dark net. Today they go in prison one by one. Also I remember btc in the beginning. At SETI private group there was a request to test the new digital money before the bitcoin core was released. I remember 100 btc for 5 bucks. It is based on SHA which is an NSA invention. Also TOR was originally created for US marines. The devil’s trick is to trick everyone that he is not the Devil itself. :)
Just a joke.

With most of bitcoins out of US, I doubt it.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:20:06
IMO it could be some monitored funds, that were stolen or a scam related. Try to reach Coinbase Support about it. They are fast in response by default, but your case could be more sophisticated. 
Keep posting how it goes. It is an interesting case, that community would be interested to know.

There was a problem in the past with bitcoin. You could withdraw a small fragment more than you own in your wallet. So I guess the total supply is greater than 21m. In fact, it is the same as fiat. And way more volatile.

Fiat costs 1000x times or even more. :)
To make the cotton sheets costs electricity. To make it anti-counterfeit, costs millions. To print it, to save it, to transport it... It is a long list. 
Crypto is cheaper in general. But needs improvement. :)
Do your research before posting. ;)
In fact crypto is better for banks. Low maintenance system, no need of so many offices. I bet it is cheaper to maintain bitcoin hashrate than to pay the electricity of major banks offices around the world. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:54:23
IMO crypto currencies are FIAT 2.0.  Don’t get me wrong. Crypto transactions are cheaper, which is a big advantage. :)
On the other hand, most people don’t care about the technology. They want to use their money easy, secure and reliable. 
With improvements, adoption will come. :)

It is a joke of course. But if someone is scared of this scenario, I don’t mind paying me 10 dollars per bitcoin, and I will accept to hold em. :)

Let’s hope US don’t mess up with the world’s economy again like in 2008 :) 
I see why you see crypto as a safe boat. Basically it is cheaper to maintain and little more secure than fiat. But definitely like all fiat it is not a store of value at all. So do not invest in it that much. :)
