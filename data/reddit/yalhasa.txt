As far as I know, those mining pool farms are fully owned by bitmain and located in China. Please correct me if I am wrong

My question is really focused on BTC. Can you throw in a percentage of what you think their hash power is? If you really think its nowhere 51%, how did you conclude that?

Great answer, I am not suggesting that they attack BTC to destroy the chain (ex 51%), it would be them shooting themselves in the foot. 
What I am suggesting is bitmain forming a cult like mining pool that basically favours some minors. When one of those favoured minors solves the PoW puzzle of block A at lets say 7 minutes, it basically withholds the solution for some time and get a head start on resolving block B. 
Then publishes block A solution at 9 minutes to collect rewards and fee, and potentially solve Block B way earlier than the rest of the network because of the head start.

You are right, but that doesnt address the withholding atk concern. Unless you are suggesting that these farms are not owned by bitmain and simply meta administrated by them a.k.a they have no power of taking decisions on their behalf
