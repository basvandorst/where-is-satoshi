This is just for Rakuten Super Logistics (RSL) in the USA (to start with).  It is for B to B transactions from online retailers to RSL. 
Now online retailers can pay for RSL services in bitcoin.  This is really one of the first times (perhaps the first) a service providers is offering to accept bitcion for payment, at least in this space.  Now a retailer can sell in bitcoin and pay for their order fulfillment services in bitcoin directly to RSL, no converting to fiat to pay for services.
Mikitani-san hinted Rakuten might accept bitcoin on Rakuten ecommerce sites in the near future (about a month ago I think).  
Rakuten also owns Buy.com in the USA and just changed the name to Rakuten.com.  That could be the next Rakuten company to take bitcoin for online retail.  We will see.  Regardless, it is a big step in the right direction.

I download Bitsquare and tried to use it just now.  Someday it might work but right now it won't work in the US.  Buying Bitcoin is a problem people.

I don't care about Circle and Goldman.  I never used Circle.  I am not easily able to buy Bitcoin.  I am asking where I can buy it easily (other than local bitcoins which is also a pain), and if anyone who owns it is concerned that it is really difficult for people to start owning/using Bitcoin and what are the implications of that for Bitcoin.

I read your post again...now what.  I don't want to work...I am retired.  
If you are not a US person how do you buy bitcoins easily?

Another question.  If people would spam the system when the block size is unlimited, why wouldn't they spam it now and fill up all the 1MB blocks to clog the present system?

Not sure what the relevance of this post is.  It's not very helpful.
