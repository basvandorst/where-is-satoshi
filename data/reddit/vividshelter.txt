Yes I see your point, although I imagine bitcoin would just stay locked on the blockchain once you die. Many people (myself include) find that the value of money come not just in spending it but also in holding it because holding it gives you options and freedom.

Bitcoin won't prevent censorship. If anything it will enhance censorship. For example, suppose the biggest holders of bitcoin bought out the media and censored someone. With fiat the government can intervene in the economy and force the company to not censor under threat of asset seizure by the state. With bitcoin the government has no control over the funds and cannot stop censorship. All the censorship happening now is done by private companies under a system of free market capitalism and bitcoin will only enhance and make make system permanent and immutable.

I think bitcoin will be great for the poor. Mining cartels are not a problem. The reason why miners get paid is because they play an important role. They are the ones verifying transactions to ensure the security of the network. They deserve to make money. However, the current fiat system is not fair. Bankers literally print money for themselves. Printing money for yourself pays much more than running a crypto mining factory and is the reason why the gap between rich and poor is rising so fast today.

Suppose you have 1 million in a house. Then you will look rich compared if you have 1 million in bitcoin. Even though both are the same. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:38:46
But when you rent then the quality of your accommodation  is based on cash flow. You may be rich but have low cash flow especially if most your wealth is in low yield assets. Let me illustrate with an example. Suppose you have two people who have the same job as ordinary workers. suppose person A owns and lives in a $1 million house. He looks rich because he has a nice house he lives in. Now suppose person B rents a cheap unit and rides a bike and lives cheap which allows him to invest which he has been doing for many years allowing him to amass $5 million in bitcoin and $5 million in Berkshire Hathaway shares. These pay no dividends. Person B looks poor but is ten times richer than person A.

Bitcoin is an investment right now, which means that like other investments such as stocks it will be volatile. However, I am sure it will go up in value in the future so while in the short term there is volatility in the long run it will go up.

@_date: 2018-08-20 13:23:09
It will be driven mostly by the desires of the rich to conceal their wealth. Mainstream adoption will soon come after. Once the rich use something then everyone else follows. This has happened with everything else in civilization eg roads are build for rich merchants to transport goods and then over time normal people use it to travel. The law is used by the rich to protect their assets (hence property is 90% of the law) and then over time normal people use it for other matters. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:27:44
Wealth inequality will be lower, in my opinion because bitcoin supply is fixed so the rich cannot print money for themselves, which is what they are doing today and is why the wealth gap is growing so fast today. Bitcoin wealth in the future will be unequal. You cannot stop that but it will be less unequal.

An FBI analyst may be able to bring up records of bank accounts and link this to KYC/AML records at an exchange and match this to specific bitcoin addresses. However, I'm talking about finding a girlfriend or boyfriend and generally a potential date is not going to bother with this kind of in-depth analysis. They will likely use cues to judge eg whether you own a house, whether you drive a nice car, your hip-to-waist ratio etc.

That's true. Diversification among crypto would fix this. Something crypto has that differs to tech stocks is that tech companies are bound by intellectual property laws and so innovation in one tech company gives that company a monopoly. Crypto is mostly open source and so innovation proven in one crypto can be replicated in another crypto with the rewards for that innovation being in the form of price appreciation of the crypto rather than through government mandated monopoly via IP law.

I seriously doubt bitcoin will go to zero. Bitcoin is not a commodity but an idea and ideas cannot be destroyed. Once it's out then it's out. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:25:16
It all depends on how much you value income vs capital gains. Dividend stocks have passive income, which is great for financial freedom but it tends to have low growth. Most crypto have zero passive income but high growth. Personally I am a minimalist and don't need much income to be happy, so I can allocate a little more to crypto rather than dividend stocks and still live off dividends. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:56:19
Yeah but if bitcoin goes up at its current growth rate, it will pay the rent easy.

When you're old, find a young agile partner and pay him/her a regular amount of bitcoin and that partner will look after you.
Nursing homes are filled with old people whose children don't take care of them. Children grow up and usually become debt slaves themselves, so they need to work for themselves and have no time for you.
If you pay someone to look after you, they have an incentive to keep you alive because if you die the payments stop. This is why paying in bitcoin is safer. If the caregiver stands to inherit your fiat then they have an incentive to kill you rather than care for you. If you pay in bitcoin then if the caregiver kills you then the remaining bitcoin is locked on the blockchain forever.

So judge an investment based on need? Everyone needs food, so buy a bakery? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:28:48
Yes but if the returns in bitcoin continue then we can continue to reap strong returns. When people get a mortgage they pay say 4% interest and so they assume say 6% returns from real estate based on previous price appreciation in real estate. If we apply the same logic to bitcoin then we have bitcoin going up 60% in the last year so 60% per year is huge. You're better off renting and putting it all in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 03:03:20
Thank you for the ad hominem attacks and shaming. I will not reciprocate the hate but will instead try to offer constructive advice to people read this. 
Dogecoin has a lot of value. It has very low transaction costs, which means I use it when eg I am eating out and need to pay someone for half of the meal cost. I just ask them to install a crypto wallet (eg Coinomi) and accept dogecoin. The lightning network should address this issue for bitcoin in the future but for now dogecoin works well.
Living with parents is great if you can get along well with them. The general idea is that you share accommodation thereby reducing cost. I have lived with housemates as well and as my dividend income increases I will consider renting a one-bedroom unit. The idea is to simply pay for rent using dividend income. The higher your dividend income, the better your accommodation, but when starting out you should live with parents or housemates. 
Buying a family home where I live costs about $700k so a deposit will be about $140k and for most people to be able to afford a deposit they need to live with parents anyway, so why not live with parents to save up to invest into crypto and ETFs?
There are many problems with the world today with the environment and with animal welfare. Focusing on the environment, the most effective way we can reduce carbon emissions is to go childfree. The second best is to get rid of your car. The third best is to get rid of meat. Doing all these three helps reduce carbon emissions considerably. However, not only do these things reduce carbon emissions but they also help you become healthy and wealthy. Children are expensive, so having no children allows you to buy more bitcoin. Cars are expensive as well, so getting rid of your car also allows you to buy more bitcoin. If you replace meat with beans, that is also a reduction in cost, which allows you to buy more bitcoin. Eating more beans also gives you more fiber on your diet. Almost no one gets the recommended 30 grams of fiber per day. Riding a bike also gives you exercise. The benefits from these activities are not just for the environment and animal welfare but also for personal health and financial freedom.
I am not against dating or marriage. I have dated before but it didn't work. I intend to date girls in the future. I am not some crazy right-wing misogynist MGTOW. I actually truly love women. I also think that prostitution is great and should be legalised around the world. It provides women with the ability to earn money and be independent, but there is a big difference between sex work and sex trafficking. If you live off dividends, invest in crypto, ride a bike and live with housemates, there's no reason why you cannot date or marry. There are many girls out there who are committed to a childfree lifestyle as well. I just need to find one.
Where did I get the money to buy ETFs and crypto? I just got a job and worked. Working becomes very easy when you are childfree. People's childrearing responsibilities often force them to leave the office. A childfree person can capitalise on this because he or she can simply be available all the time and can soak in knowledge and learn skills. Work also becomes easy when you have no obligations or debt because you have no fear of the organisation. You are not a slave to your manager so you can impose your vision of how you think an effective organisation should run, and if people don't like it and fire you for your initiative, you simply live off dividends while looking for another job, and even if you cannot find another job, you live off dividends anyway, so you have the freedom to do what you love for a job, if you want to work at all.

ETFs are different in every country. Here in Australia there are many high dividend ETFs eg IHD, EINC, VHY, etc. These ETFs invest in companies that pay high dividends. Companies that pay high dividends usually have lower growth, but that is why you buy crypto to give a good balance between passive income and growth.
In terms of the environment and personal finances, dropping meat may make the least impact compared to riding a bike and never having children, but I've researched a lot into veganism and the billions of animals who are slaughtered every week to create food that we humans don't even need nutritionally, and every dollar spend buying meat provides an incentives for the meat industry to kill more animals. If you replace meat with beans, then beans are much cheaper than meat, so you do save money that can be used to buy eg bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:05:22
It depends how much money you've got. If you went all in bitcoin early and now have $10m worth of BTC then you can rent for life with ease. Only people who don't have much money are slaves to landlord because rent is high. If you buy bread for a baker, are you a slave to the bakery? No because bread is cheap compared to how much you have. So how do you get so much that rent and bread becomes cheap? You buy high growth assets. Most people judge real estate based on past performance. Apply the same principle to bitcoin and we have an asset that can make you very rich due to high growth rate thereby making you a slave to no one.
Let's say you have a modest $1m in BTC. Let's say it goes up 10% per year (conservative as in the last year it's gone up 60%) then that is already $100k per year you're making. It's more than enough for rent, bread, and anything else.

That's true. When you rent a house then you rent land off a landlord. When you buy a house you rent money from a bank. At the end of the day what matters is having enough money to afford the necessities. This is where a minimalist lifestyle helps as well as investing in an asset with such huge growth rate that your wealth dwarfs the cost of rent and food. This is when you become free.

It would be theoretically possible for someone to lend against bitcoin but then you'd need to give the lender control of the BTC because they will take it in case you miss your payments. This means giving up your private keys. Why would you want to do that? When borrowing against real estate you give your deed to then bank. 
There is no point borrowing against bitcoin. Leverage is used to increase returns but bitcoin already has very high returns. Unleveraged bitcoin has returns far more than leveraged real estate.
Borrowing also imposes on you interest payments, which is an obligation that reduces your freedom. It is better to own outright and be free from obligation.

Paying the landlord rent is not a problem if you have a lot of money to pay it. How do you get the money to pay it? A high growth asset like bitcoin helps.
