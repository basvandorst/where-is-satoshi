But honest speaking, he should at least donate some to the charity, such as Wikileaks (1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v), Sean Outpost (38ccq12hPFoiSksxUdr6SQ5VosyjY7s9AU, 1M72SffApidbsWcWoX9jiLm5arrR2PMhTr), etc etc....

Imagine if you bought at the ATH of $1200... you are 50% down... This is bitcoin and it will happen when you least expect it!

The confirmation time is random... the block you waited took more than 30 minutes to confirm, but the blocks before only took a few minutes. On average, it's about 10min.

Is this an attempt to DDOS reddit or @_date: 2016-11-10 04:09:28
This will happen in a day's time! Hopefully we will see a significant increase in demand that could drive the price higher.

Most likely it is the pesos reaches "all-time low" after trump elected... Just look at the MXN/USD chart and you will know. However, it does look like bitcoin is becoming quite a stable currency!

Maybe try to send it to another btc address?

Maybe a "To the Moon" guy will be better?

Maybe you can try to broadcast another transaction to my address 19vjkM1or35FVN2Ac8bHDUh2f9msE3Dmd7? If it is successful then I will send it back to you and we can have few more rounds of "practice". I am also interested in this lock time thingy.
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:21:36
Perhaps you can try to create another transaction and try to broadcast it using other sites, such as localbitcoin. This time you can try using a "future" locktime or just without the lock time. This is basically how to unstuck the unconfirmed tx by "double spending" it.
In case it works, 19vjkM1or35FVN2Ac8bHDUh2f9msE3Dmd7

I am not expert in this yet but I do not think you are locking the address. I think setting a locktime is to ask the network in incorporate the transaction only after the set time/date. 
Your address shouldn't be locked.

The best is to sell it on ebay and buy some bitcoin with the earning...
