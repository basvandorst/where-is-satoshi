They are. You do not have the money.

Money, that others here lost. Where do you think your money ultimately came from? It is the money some other guy who invested in bitcoin worked hard for and lost it to you.

Bitcoin was still at 6k at the lowest point. So it was no KO. If he sold slowly like you suggested, it is not unlikely that it would have dropped to like 4k.
A wise decision in the stock market might be a dumb decision in the crypto market.
Fundamentals have a place in this discussion because fundamentals are the reason why Buffets plan to buy slowly worked: The fundamentals of Coca Cola did not change, so there was no reason the price will go up too much just because him slowly buying huge amounts. This is not the case for crypto. There are no fundamentals. So someone having the plan to slowly sell everything might just cause an even bigger crash than selling very quickly.

The operator does not have to be a person. It can be a preprogrammed technology, too.


Yes, they are. You bought your bitcoin for $1000 and sold it for $10000. These $9000 are the money of later investors.


In a free economy, this is true for everything you put money in. It is even true for ponzi schemes: Supply and demand sets the price of how much you have to pay to join a ponzi scheme.
If you demand too much, the ponzi scheme does not work because you do not get new investors. If you demand too less, old investors do not get enough reward and they do not want to get new investors.
Bitcoin is the perfect ponzi, because it does everything automatically: Set the price in a market place exactly so high that there are still people willing to buy bitcoins.

Yeah, here we are: I am not able to find how everybody can profit with bitcoin and not just the early buyers.
And you also not able to answer my questions. Despite the age of instant information. So my guess is: There is no way that there is a net plus among all bitcoin investors. It is not just us not finding a way. There actually is no way.
Proof me wrong if you can. You have all modern technology to assist you...

It is completely wrong. The opposite is true. Deflationary currencies make the rich even richer and also will not work in the long run. Economics 101.

The point of for example TSLA is that you hope they will be the one big car manufacturer of the future. If you buy TSLA, you are expecting Tesla to make a profit in the future and pay you dividend based on the future profit.
Now you might be right or you might be wrong about TSLA. But there is a possibility that all investors win if Tesla turns into a profitable company.
With bitcoin, there is not such a chance. It will never return some profit to you, unless "a greater fool" buys your bitcoin for a higher price.

Buy and hold is a smart strategy for long term investments in an index fond. There will be good and bad times, but long term the economy will grow and with a good index fond you are part of it.
Long term is not a good strategy for speculative investments. Here, you have to be smarter than the other investors. Sell before the others sell. Buy before the others buy.
I did not buy before the others bought with bitcoin. But I sold before the others sold. And will not come back. $4000 is my profit with bitcoin and now I am looking for another adventure to invest a few $1000. Bitcoin is over for me.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:39:29
Let me resume:
I: good argument why bitcoin is a ponzi
You: but what about stocks????
I: explained the difference between stocks and bitcoin
You: hurr durr i am smart
No, you are not! Can you name one stock that is not and never will pay dividends?
Gold is not a good investment if you adjust for inflation: 
It is especially bad compared to stocks.
It is not a ponzi because it is (if you do it right) used as a long term storage of value that survives wars. You could easily turn gold into a ponzi if you start a hype of people investing in it in hope that can get a Lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:08:42


You hope that they will pay dividends in the future. Otherwise, they are indeed worthless.
But are there stocks of companies that are guaranteed to never pay dividends and are not worthless? This seems like an imaginary point. But if you find one: Please tell me. I would like to short it.


Bad investment! They mostly just compensate inflation, plus minus luck or bad luck.

Who is the screaming child, though??

You indeed did not do this and therefore your whole reasoning is faulty.
Coca-Cola has real fundamentals. This is why it is a smart thing for the world's best investors to buy small parts per day.
Bitcoin does not have real fundamentals, therefore the same move might be very stupid for bitcoin. Rather, you sell before the others start selling, too. So you must be quick.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:55:00
I made about $5000 profit with bitcoin, but I know why I did it: I took a risk (which I could afford), got some luck and sold faster than others.
It is not because I am a genius investor. This idiot got lucky, like some gamblers in Las Vegas, and thinks that he is brilliant and deserves the money. Idiot! You got lucky!
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:52:36
Exactly. In earlier times, a few 1000 investors got burned. But there were 10,000 new ones ready to enter.
Now like 10,000,000 people got burned, but there are -most likely- not 100,000,000 new ones to enter. People are aware of bitcoin. People have thought of buying bitcoins themselves. Those who still did not buy in the end of 2017 also won't buy in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:32:02
Oh, yes, a list why it is totally not a ponzi. This is a must have for every ponzi.
Also, you did not answer my question.
Bye bye stupidus

Here is a list with 5 reasons why it is not a pyramid scheme:
1. A real pyramid scheme requires one person to control it all.
2. Bitcoin is not controlled by one person.
3. A real pyramid scheme is a pyramid scheme.
4. Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme.
5. Unlike a pyramid scheme, bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme.

You can't compare Bitcoin to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola has actual fundamentals to guide the price of the stocks. You give the market enough time and the price will get closer to the fundamental value again.
There are no fundamentals with bitcoin. The only "fundamentals" are if people want to buy or want to sell right now. So if you sell, you have an interest to be quick before others start to sell, too. You selling is a "fundamental" in bitcoin. It means others should sell, too, because the price will tank. So you have to catch the others by surprise.
You have no idea what the ideal amount of bitcoin is to dump at once. Too less and you do not cash out enough before the others start to sell, too. Too much and you cause a flash crash maybe even to zero on this very thin market.

My memaw did not talk about bitcoin in 2013. She did in the end of 2017, though.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:56
The only way you can profit with bitcoin is if other people join later for a higher price. This makes it a ponzi.
Or is there a way to make a profit with bitcoin without other guys losing? I am not aware. Please tell me if there is.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:30:03
Exactly! Previously, there were still new potential buyers. This time, your dad, your co-workers and all bought bitcoin. It was all over the news. Everyone knows bitcoin now and people who did not buy until now will also not buy in the future. The ponzi is over.
Luckily, there is a new one:

One brother might have more say than the other brother.
You have to write the rules of a pyramid scheme in software in order to not be a pyramid scheme anymore.

The important thing is that you do not invest in a new and innovative technology with buying bitcoin.
\1. You do not own part of this technology with buying bitcoin.
\2. You do not support the developers of this technology with buying bitcoin.
It is like... like paying $10000 to have an email sent to you. Email is a nice technology. But you do not own it while paying to get an email. You also do not support the inventor of the email by doing so.


Bitcoin revolutionized it.
Bitcoin claims to reinvent currencies. It did not. It is useless as a currency. It lacks all key requirements for a proper currency.
However, it reinvented the ponzi. It took a regular ponzi and took it to perfection. A new level of ponzi, better than all ponzis before. Hell, it is so good in being a ponzi that you can barely even notice how it is -in the core- a ponzi. It has all key requirements for a good ponzi.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:47:14


This is true. And this is the reason why good investments pay dividends or generate income.
That is the reason why professional investors buy stocks, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:57:02
I love how people saying "bitcoin is not a ponzi" never make a coherent counterargument. It is always "you clearly don't understand", "uh, it is the blockchain, tHe fuTuRE" or "you lack vision".
They never explain how the success of the early investors is not a result of the loss of late investors. And how there is a possibility that all investors of bitcoin make some profit. These two things make it a ponzi. You need something better than "you do not get bitcoin!" if you want to convince me that it is not a ponzi.
I know plenty about bitcoin.
I bought one for $4000, sold at $8000 and never came back when my grandma started to talk about bitcoin. Because that told me that the ponzi is over. Time to get out before the others get out. Should have waited one more month to sell at $18,000, but I could not know when exactly it will peak. So I sold one month too early. Better than one month too late, though. So I am quite happy with my $4000 profit and do not need a lesson about bitcoin.

There was no specific reason for it going up. Now it is going down for the exact same "reason".
The trouble with bitcoin is that there is no way to do a serious fundamental analysis to calculate what a reasonable price for a bitcoin should be. $0, $1, $10, $10000 and $1000000 are all just as reasonable prices for bitcoin.

Stocks and index fonds did great in this time. How are they 10% in the minus for you?
Guess your portfolio is not diverse at all.
You should only invest a tiny fraction into crypto. It is gambling money. The house (exchanges, whales, exchanges that are whales, ...) always win. This means the average investor mostly loses. The smart thing would be to not invest in crypto at all. This is how you beat the whales. But if you want to, tread it as gambling money. And don't try to recover your loses. This is a great way to lose even more. Remember: No matter how low bitcoin is, it can ALWAYS go down 50% more.
Instead put your money in stocks. Or bonds. Anything that is not a zero sum game with the cards stacked against you. And then HODL. And HODL means multiple years, not multiple weeks like in the crypto world.

Genius move:
If you lose 10k, you lost 10k on average.
But if you lose 10k, 7k, 4k, 2k and 1k, you lost less than 4k on average.
Only a small part of [chosen geniuses]( can follow your way!
PS: Sorry for your loss, though.
