i do see myself as a progressive leftie/socialist*/pirate, but no where near libertarian

computer geeks, not computer users. 
there is quite the difference. (and bitcoin is still dominated by the first group)

in the worst case they need to hand over all donations made this way over to the irs 
(i do not know if this can happen, ianal and not from the usa)
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:42:36
No, wikimedia does use coinbase and they change it into money for wikimedia.
the adress you use to send donations is from coinbase (at least so i did understood it)
and it does not "allow" them more transparency, they MUST do this because of tax reasons.
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:34:24
**Why is the name and adress needed?**
Just spoke with a guy from Wikimedia and he told me, it is a legal thing that NGO in the USA must do, otherwise they are not allowed to take the money.

"Guns and gold" is more mainstream than "computer geeks"

Sorry, no idea.
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:51:29
depends on the speakers, but even the "midprice" professional speakers want 10k and up
EDIT: oh, and writing them a email "hi, i want to be a speaker, i want 10k" is not going to work, paid speakers are invited by them (unless you have a very big name)
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:23:23
I have no idea how it is done.
I only know it is a legal requirement for NGO to get the name and adress of the donors. 
And as far as i know, coinbase is the only way to donate bitcoint to the foundation in the moment, so erm ... no you won't get them back since you are not able to donate any other way?

wouldn't that be more for a cryptocurrency user group instead of a bitcoin user group?
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:44:42
i am missing one thing 
what is the user group supposed to do/what is the goal of the user group?
in the moment it looks like a group to exist so it does exist.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:35:19
sorry, but muhahahahahahaha

otherwise the word bitcoin will be in the company mailfilter very fast.
so do not all write him today, but wait a few days and then write him.

and the price of 1 bitcoin was 8€ a year ago and now it is at 90€
half a year ago it was still under 30€﻿

they show the same price for me, perhaps a temporary glitch?
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:47:50
a few people were thinking XXX is where i sell everything, because it will not go any higher.
and since the market is still very very small, -&gt; panic
this will happen a few times again.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:10:45
selling/buying about 1000 bitcoin halves/doubles the price.
the market is very very small
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:17:43
individuals and corporations. mostly individuals who already gamble in stocks, food, oil, ... there are also a few corporations there.
banks not so much at least not in the next few months (2015 perhaps?)
there are a few guys that have a few million $/€/... to gamble with and when we look at how much money is in the game in the moment  it is just not enough for them. in the moment we are talking about people who want to earn a few (ten)thousand a day (and do this!) but the ones that want to earn a million a day .... they are still elsewhere (and earn that money there)
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:14:24
the question is just, buy now, buy in an hour, buy ...?
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:50:15
yes, it is lowering right now
from 800$ an hour ago to 655$ right now.
but i do not think it will ever go down to 100, i think it will stop at about 450
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:07:22
imho we are still dealing with the small fish here.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:41:55
go on  (or other chart sites) and looks at the lower chart
and yes, 1000 coins are traded, but in both directions, i was talking about a massive trading high/low
and of the 12,000,000 only a few are in the market at any moment, most of those sit in some wallet and are not touched. mtgox has only a trading volume of 115,374 BC!

dear op, you are 100% right.
bitcoin are a neat thing, but they are not mainstream yet and it is too much work to cash them in

@_date: 2013-11-20 14:28:26
i am not sure if the "price" of bitcoin was really 900$, as far as i have seen it, it was one transfer with this number while all others were way lower.
and i do not think many were made, only very few bitcoin are in the trade, most are hoarded away
