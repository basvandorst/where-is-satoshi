is the following true?:
if i want to send 2btc over the LN everybody along the route needs to have at least 2btc in their payment channel?
I tried to find information about it myself but the paper on LN is extremely hard to understand.

No, thats just what they want you to think in order to legitimise their agenda. In reality bash has been created to make money and centralize control.

You can never be sure about the future. But you can say that bitcoin has followed the charted trend for about 10 years now. That makes it at least somewhat likely that the pattern will continue.

It sometimes feels like we are interpreting his words as if he was our prophet.

have you seen the bitcoin market performance lately? One piece of bad news comes out and the market tanks 20%. A few days later it turns out that the bad news was actually fake news and what does the price do? It goes down 1-2% more. There is no link between good news and bull runs in my opinion.

Please remember that the CME Futures (and most futures in general) will be cash settled. That means that nobody involved in their trade will ever have to own bitcoin at any time.
The only way this effects the price of bitcoin is if someone tries to manipulate it to „win“ in the futures trade.

Not even a segwit address. Shame on you.
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:09:19
it depends on how you define health. If you're talking about defence against a 51&amp; attack then yes.
@_date: 2018-05-09 06:25:08
Maybe the market is overbought. Maybe it is being manipulated so people can get in at lower prices. Who knows.

For someone starting out, I would recommend buying BTC over the counter. You will pay more than on an exchange but the process is a little easier.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:23:18
by that logic everything is finite.

Bitcoin can be patched. 
Once you can manufacture Gold in a cheap and safe way, it will never be worth what it was.
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:12:42
Its like, bitcoin has a mind of its own!
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:13:31
Actually, you can create gold artificially. Doing that is more expensive than what you get out of it, but it is possible.
This is also the reason, why there is a limit of what gold can ever be worth. once gold is worth enough that its economically viable to create it artificially, the price will no longer rise.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:19:23
First of all, gold can be created artificially. Yes, it is expensive and yes, the gold you get out of this process is radioactive - but it is possible. Who knows, in a few decades it might be cheaper to create gold than to mine it.
Also, there is an abundant amount of gold in the universe. It is not yet easily accessible but it is there. 
Bitcoin, in contrast, cannot be created artificially (not now, not in 50 years) and you won’t find any more in this Universe either.

Are you also a time traveler?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:08:21
That depends. I guess they do not accept deposits past a certain $ amount. For BCH that limit is currently around $5k or ~4 BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:53:40
You can use a sealed opendime multiple times. A can pay B by handing it over and B can pay C by handing it over again and so on. That way bitcoin has changed hands but all these transactions aren't recorded on the blockchain.

Why is nobody suggesting shapeshift.io? No registration needed.
It only works for relatively small amounts though.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:06:38
Do you really think that actual people do most of the trading? I guess its computers and algorithms that make most buy/sell decisions. And those run 24/7.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:56:40
every holder can add BTC. To withdraw you have to break the seal, after wich the Opendime displays its private key.
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:56:34
One person sold a lot of Bitcoin and another bought a lot of bitcoin a short time later.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:09:58
so, you are betting that bitcoin has a bright future, but you can't imagine that we will be able to create gold artificially in a cheap and safe way?

"Govern yourself if you want governance."
Says the guy that works at a company that charges 10k$ for a custodial bitcoin solution.

I don't think that surveys are a good indicator of what is going to happen. People in the sixties thought we would all be using flying cars by now.
@_date: 2018-11-04 21:04:18
If they hold the keys - for whatever reason - it is custodial.

Well, as a rule of thumb: if a company starts to heavily discount one of their older products over a longer period (ledger started discounting the nano s a month before christmas), you can assume that a new product is about to be launched
@_date: 2019-01-07 12:02:04
The private keys were never compromised in the wallet.fail hack. The trezor wallet however leaked the private keys.
I think that this shows that a ledger wallet is pretty secure. Maybe even more than the competition.

Bitcoin cannot be a Pyramid scheme because there is no hierarchy. There is no „top“ that collects all the profits. 
If bitcoin was a pyramid scheme then gold would also be one.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:52:57
Just because you can copy the idea of Bitcoin doesn’t mean you can copy Bitcoin. 
For example, if I would start to issue my own fiat currency with me being the central bank, it would work the same as any other fiat but it wouldn’t have the same value as the dollar or euro. it probably wouldn’t even be used anywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:49:01
There was an article of a trezor being hacked by its owner, because he forgot the pin. the vulnerability has been fixed however.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:36:43
That is just a hack of the wallet software. the private key isn't compromised as opposed to the patched trezor hack. this also doesn't apply if you use an alternate wallet software like electrum for example.

Just to clarify for anyone wondering: Segwit is not a fork. It did not copy the blockchain AND change the rules. Therefore you didn't get additional "Segwit coins" as you did with the BCH fork. Segwit is an add-on to avoid a fork.
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:46:16
I just looked into the "casa" service Jameson lopp was talking about and I was shocked to discover that it costs $10k annually. At first I thought this had to be a typo.
I mean, its a nice idea and all but even for someone who owns $500k+ in crypto (they are the stated target audience) its a pretty steep price.
I hope someone comes up with a cheaper alternative.
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:54:54
Even if quantum computers become reality there will be quantum encryption too. Bitcoin could simply move to quantum cryptography and all is well again.
I really don’t get all the fear around quantum computers.

it is also worth remembering that the 2x fork had only one developer. If the miners were actually serious about the 2x fork why haven't they dedicated more resources to the project?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:39:14
there was no agreement on 2x by the bitcoin development community. the agreement happened mostly between miners who never actually planned on following through any way.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:24:56
Hardware wallets also need trust. Every software and hardware you use could be manipulated.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:40:13
They only have to make it hard enough to trade Bitcoin so that it is no longer practical. Then, it wont be worth the effort and Bitcoin will lose value. 
They do not have to shut down the internet for this to happen.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:29:08
You said that physical access is always root access, which implies access to private keys. That is what i objected to.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:39:30
ledger has a bug bounty program. what more of an incentive would you like?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:57:18
Well, no.
They couldn't get the seed or pin from a ledger nano s. Even with physical access.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:35:28
Have you even read how the attacks on ledger devices are supposed to work?
All attacks on the nano s require physical access to the device and none of them compromise the private key or pin. The one attack that  supposedly compromises the pin on a ledger blue device requires that you do not move the device or cable and the attacker has to be in very close proximity for a long time.
Personally, I am not very worried.
