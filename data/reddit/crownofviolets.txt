Hey folks,
To preserve greater anonymity, I've opened up some orders accepting 175 XCP (roughly $100) for 1 LECHAT via Counterparty's DEX rather than through the cottontail group website. You can buy them by going to your Counterparty wallet exchange ( and looking up the pair LECHAT/XCP.
If you don't have XCP, you can trade for it on the Poloniex exchange: 
If you want to buy your tokens for BTC, you can still order directly through the website.

I know it's scary but it's okay. Learning how to be a compassionate human being can be hard.

Probably because there isn't enough people exchanging to warrant paying a full-time staff person or people to man the store. ;) Through appointments, they can run the store without the cost of a salary.

Maybe, but it might not be nearly as fun. Marketing doesn't have to be about flyers and business cards. Marketing can be about making something cool and then sharing it with others.

A crowdfunding campaign to produce a free serial fiction that introduces readers to bitcoin.
"Sixty years after it was abandoned the White City has been taken under the wing of a new development collective. They've remade the city into an urban paradise and beacon of social change with digital currency, urban food forests, and a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence with enough power to run the city for a thousand years. Her name is Edyn and there's just one problem; they need to test her. Lured by the promise of fame and fortune, the most notorious hackers in the world are invited to come to the new city to test their skills against the ai program and prove whether or not utopia can really exist."

The Edyn Project is a serial ficion, novella size, about a group of hackers that go up against an ai. The setting is a newly revitalized city where digital currency and other services have been installed to help stimulate growth and happiness. The bitcoinstarter was to raise funds to pay an artist for some work, an editor, as well as myself for writing the story. The story will be written over the next few months and available on the internet.

Bitcoins don't have a gender but the people in our bitcoin communities do have genders and interactions between each other. A community grows by being accessible to many different people and spotlighting a part of that is a great way to raise awareness and visibility.

The fact that the list is small is exactly why I wanted to make it. Why isn't it more equal at this point? Maybe it's more equal than we think and we don't even know.
