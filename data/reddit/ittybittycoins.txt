I'm surprised at the lack of evidence and context you provide, especially with the quantity of reddit experience you clearly have.
There are lots of Coinbase shitposts, and it's important to provide censored screenshots and as much detail as possible.

Comparing Coinbase to MtGox the company, or Mark Karpeles the CEO running things, is ridiculous.
No disagreement on the second half of your point, which I fully embrace and support. Which is why I do not store anything at Coinbase.
But, you need to be called out for that first comparison.

I lean towards believing you based on your reddit history, which is why I'm pushing you to provide evidence. This is an extremely important post if your evidence is clear. We don't get a lot of established users making posts like this.
Any online gambling? Interaction with questionable exchanges? Tumblers/mixers? Exchanging for the more sketchy alt-coins? (I'm not claiming any one of these is wrong, just asking questions and playing devil's advocate)

Your willingness to have Coinbase reps engage you publicly is an interesting twist to these kinds of posts. Usually, OP complaining about Coinbase did something clearly illegal in their jurisdiction, and tries to play dumb.
It would be interesting to me if your purchasing was halted due to mixing coins, which is not illegal (unlike if you were US-based and sent btc directly to online casinos).

Commenting only on price, the problem is simple: lack of new money and investors. Mainstream investing is not a comfortable process (see: Coinbase, Circle). LocalBitcoins isn't a reasonable response to the purchase process, for your average person.
Long term holders (not day to day speculators), how many of us are comfortable with our current holdings? Sure, we all want more, but I think most people are pretty patient right now.
What is it going to take to sign up new users? From my perspective, retrofitting existing services is what needs to happen. Regardless of how we feel about PayPal, they should partner with Coinbase to allow the purchasing of bitcoins through your existing established PayPal account. That way, people do not need to sign-up with Coinbase (this is just one example).
More honest ATMs. For example, there are quite a few ATMs within an hour from me. I have no idea how to determine which ATM requires access to my first-born on a $100 purchase, or only requires that when I spend $3,000 or more in a day. If I'm going to be forced to scan my testicles for a $100 purchase, I'd rather just use Coinbase.

Advantage comes down to adoption, and applications built on top of the given blockchain. You tell me, how is litecoin VC money looking?
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:33:24
The elephant is bigger than that. The elephant in the room is that many of Bitcoin's best uses are illegal. Those uses may break laws that are bullshit (money laundering and tax evasion), but many users are regularly breaking law, knowingly or unknowingly.
What we need is store of value adoption and people treating this as an investment. Contrary to what many short sighted people here say, we are STILL in the hoarding and investment stage. Merchant adoption is fairly meaningless. It helps, especially with image and the illusion of adoption, but we need easier ways to purchase bitcoin (in terms of the user's subjective perspective of storage security, and identity security).
Problem is, existing laws and regulations make purchase annoying (Coinbase, Circle, most ATMs, all fucking a horrible experience). Even LocalBitcoins is uncomfortable for most, like Craigslist, but they'll probably be shutdown soon anyway, not that rebuilding or decentralizing it is difficult.

Most people want their finances controlled by U.S. laws and regulations. We, are not most people. Bitcoin allows for both realities. There's room for both. Stop shitting on a reality you disagree with when the underlying technology is neutral.

He's making it clear this is for financial intermediaries, the crossover from digital currency to fiat currency. He's making analogies to cash, and how they don't regulate the company that makes the wallet in your back pocket. This is looking like a net positive.

Practically everything in computer science relies on math, but that doesn't mean they're mathematical subjects. This guy grouped "math, physics, biology, chemistry", and it's reasonable to infer they're looking for more traditional discussions in said fields, rather than reaching the conclusions you are making.
The quickest analogy I could come up with without spending a lot of time thinking about this is art. If there was an art group, speaking about only art subjects, it would be understandable if they shunned a discussion on Adobe Photoshop.

Coinbase serves a needed purpose. The mainstream is becoming more retarded. That has been the trend for years and it is not letting up. Look at our political decisions. Look at the quantity of bullshit reality TV. Look at how the Internet and powerful tools like social media are used. It's fucked.
My point is that Coinbase serves the purpose to meet mainstream needs. If you have the capacity and interest to be in control of your privacy and be more 'off the grid', then you should do it. No need to announce it.

Playing devil's advocate a bit...
Even though math is fundamental to Bitcoin, it doesn't mean Bitcoin is a math subject. The two topics you heard the youth speak on were population, and the neuroscience of diet. And then, the "adult" you spoke to mentions math, physics, biology and chemistry subjects as options... all quite distant from Bitcoin.
It doesn't sound like economics or computer science are relevant subject matters based on the information you shared in this post, and gathered from the "adult".
Perhaps there are some prejudices from the "adult", but perhaps you may have misinterpreted some of those prejudices from emotional conclusions.

Simple and fun. But, drop the slider and think of a different visual approach having all the information shown at once.
EDIT: Also, isolating data to specific populations makes this easier to grasp. For example, if you took 21,000,000 bitcoins, and spread them out evenly across every person 18 years of age or older in the United States, that would be .0858 btc per person.

I'm glad you brought up socialist vibe. In American politics, there's this uprising that bridges socialists and libertarians. There's an overlap between the new generation of politics where the priority is pushing out the special interests establishment. It's one reason why in the past, Kucinich and Ron Paul (opposite sides of the spectrum) worked so well together and were friends. It is worth acknowledging this within the context of Ron Paul (maybe Rand as well.. jury is still out on him IMO), and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders may want bigger government for social services, but Paul and Sanders are aligned when it comes to stopping special interests, the police state, and reducing the military industrial complex.

This may be unpopular. The IRS is one of the most reasonable US government agencies. They know how to sniff out tax evasion vs. tax avoidance. They want to work with you. The fines and interest are mostly reasonable. What you are describing makes me very skeptical. There are many important details missing and it reads different that how the IRS normally behaves, almost like you're describing a rogue agent. Also, that fine you mention sounds like a FinCen fine, and unrelated to the IRS.

There's a difference between enjoying conspiracy theories, considering them, treating them as fact, and making the reference you did. Destroying Bitcoin right now is not very difficult. It sure as fuck doesn't require some 3 letter agency. The 3 letter agency can chill on the sidelines for a long fucking time before they do anything, if it's truly in their interest to do something.
Also, these 3 letter agencies you speak of, have already become extremely vocal about the DANGERS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY SCARY SCARY. That is an inference to Bitcoin, distributed software, and the general world of privacy and decentralization.

I found his statements about the inability to ban bitcoin, and the analogies to cash and the inability to regulate the wallet in your back pocket, to be very important. He was poking fun at the "OMG BAN THE BITCOINS!" crowd. He even said, "the genie is out of the bottle."

I'm not a strong developer, but I imagine making a fundamental change to incentivize nodes would be a huge undertaking and a potential solution?
Incentivizing nodes would mean we can dramatically increase the blockchain storage and bandwidth requirements. Even "large" numbers like 5TB or 10TB of storage are not prohibitively expensive for a hobbyist (We're only at 34GB right now).

You nailed it. I've introduced 6 non-technical people so far, who conceptually understand Bitcoin and blockchain tech. All of them are long-term holders.

No reason to shit on Coinbase for those reasons. They serve a purpose. The cool thing about Bitcoin is every purpose can be served, just like paper cash fiat. As they grow, they'll inevitably increase in making the mistake of being overly paranoid and cautious with their AML/KYC monitoring. There are just not many reputable stories of truly legit users (legit from Coinbase's perspective) getting denied.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:12:53

Coinmarketcap.com is a destination for many. They shouldn't be selling advertising to anyone who asks. The leading online Bitcoin destinations have a responsibility to the industry.

You're right, but I was making two comments.
