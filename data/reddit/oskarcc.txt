Well you are right, should read the forum more often, but i was always like "nahhhh" but why is gox still functional if they cant payout? this is a scam from my point of view.

How come two people block something which is decentralised? Is Bitcoin owned by the two of them?... Please Eli5 for me.

early this year i have found out about bitcoins and i was like this will never pay off. i wanted to buy around 100 of them but i was stupid and young?? and spent the money on a GAME a stupid game! right now i could of had 100,000$ and be happy ever after but no! i spent my money on a game. So the moral of this story is to, listen to your gut instinct not your friends!
