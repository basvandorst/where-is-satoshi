Her handwriting is awful so here is the translation
-come home from work try to have a conversation - patrick to busy looking at graph
-sitting on couch need to finish PPT by tomorrow AM, need help b/c I suck at PPT, patrick helps less than 5 min then he’s too busy looking at alternative energy sources to mine bitcoin 
-9 hours of each day spent looking at bitcoin websites (she went through my browser history)
-patrick too busy to unpack clothes from vacation, make food to feed himself or me, feed the dog or put away things because too busy looking at bitcoin
-90% of texts and conversations with friends and family have involved cryptocurrency 
-more than 10 people now personally invested money and can lose it all and I’m partially responsible
-wardrobe becoming only crypto related
