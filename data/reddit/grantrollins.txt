Ok, you made the mistake of explaining a single instance of transaction malleability as the sole source of all the lost bitcoins. I was not asking for a definition of transaction malleability.... I was asking what were the two specific transactions you referenced that contained all the lost bitcoins. But to clarify for everyone else, the OP was talking about a theoretical concept, not an actuality.

Mt. Gox, as business, is worth only as much as it can fraudulently suck out of it's locked in customers over the next few weeks before it collapses. The numbers being posted are real. Ten's of millions in exchange fees over the last few weeks since the fraud went public. The exchange will dissipate, Karpeles will go into hiding, and that's the end of the story. Sorry.
