Hi John,
This is Bitfinexed.
So, let me explain a bit:
I work for several employers and most of my work is remote (I usually build infrastructure for businesses and manage everything remotely), so I'm able to sit at a computer all day.
This gives me plenty of time to focus on other projects, such as Bitcoin, while still collecting a paycheck. I'm not unlike a fire man, I have to work when I'm called to do something.
The price of bitcoin is actually completely irrelevant to me, up or down I do not actually give a shit. I get a kick out of watching Bitfinex counterfeit up a hundred million dollars and then within minutes watching tens of millions of dollars of buying of the entire orderbook, further proving my point.
Yes, I sold my bitcoin, I also knew that Charlie Lee was doing a massive pump and dump of Litecoin... and I could have made easily 20-30 million dollars from that, as opposed to 'hodling' Bitcoin. Am I butthurt about that? No.
The reason why I am so focused on this story is for a simple reason:
**It's one of the biggest frauds in recent history**.


Can you show me one of these trash posts where I post something that is false? I'd appreciate it, thanks. 
Finally, I'm not bitter about buying bitcoin for $1 and selling for $1200. I made a lot of fucking money. I never have to work again, but I choose to work because it keeps me sharp.
Finally, the fallout from the Tether disaster has the possibility of inviting overbearing regulations, or even banning (and yes... they can do this by banning exchanges!) on crypto-currencies, everyone is going to want to blame Bitcoin when it crashes due to the Tether fraud (which is the same as the MtGOX fraud).
I want to make sure the blame is put on Tether/Bitfinex, and NOT Bitcoin or crypto-currencies. Hopefully setting the table for regulated exchanges, instead of outright bans of Bitcoin and crypto-currencies.
That's why I'm one persistent motherfucker. I'm not the first one to try and expose Bitfinex and Tether, plenty came before me but then quit.
I'm not giving up.

You don't get it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:59:43
No, it's because my account was spammed with hundreds of thousands of fake accounts and accounts that are suspect are blocked.
That's why I mention to put  for 30 minutes in your description so the bot overlooks you.
Whats your handle, i'll unblock.
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:56:34
Oh look, I said bitfinex/tether would never do an audit, and they just got dropped by their auditor as a client.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:54:54
You don't understand, I want bitcoin to rise on fundamentals and not fraud.
Because if it rises on fraud, it crashes. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:25:53
They ended support because transactions are too expensive.
Retweets are not endorsements.

Just because I'll retweet a negative post about bitcoin doesn't mean "I hate bitcoin", also, I own zero cryptos so I have no horse in the race for bitcoin or bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:13:02
How about audio of the directors of Tether, lying about tethers relationship to Bitfinex, admitting to bank fraud, money laundering, admitting they thought of pushing wash sales through their engine?
Would that be proof of fraudulent activity? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:07:22
The fact that they can't get an audit done proves they don't have the money they say they do.
Because if they had the money, then they could get audited.

if they could do an audit, they would have done one already. they would have destroyed all of the fud.
instead, they fired the auditors, the auditor was also sent subpoenas by the way.
the public news is all out there
cftc subpoenas -&gt; auditors fired -&gt; doj criminal investigation/w cftc -&gt; texas tether report saying tether is in fact printing money.
when this was started I stated from the start that tether would never produce an audit because they simply cant. they also knew from the start they could never do an audit because they were in fact printing money out of thin air 
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:53:56


1. tethers are never redeemed, circulation only goes up.
2. you will never find a single person to claim they ever redeemed a tether. go find one.  
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:06:31
That's because you're a Bitfinex shareholder.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:07:01
Shareholders in Bitfinex are allowed to redeem Tethers, they can't talk about how it works because it's illegal.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:20:38

It's one thing to propose a way of scaling bitcoin and write up the code to do that, but BU is coming with more than just that.
They created a confederation that has rules, officers, members who have to be publicly identified if they want to have full voting rights, none of that should matter.
The only thing that should matter is the quality of the code and the ideas, not who you are. "Oh well you don't have credentials so your idea/code is automatically shit without me even reading your code."
I do wonder... if Core decided "okay, let's implement BU's scaling ideas", and have the same exact functionality... if BU would continue try to propose their BU software.

There's a benefit of having some gridlock like this, it simply means that bitcoin will be hard to change in the future. This has some pros and cons.
A big pro, in my opinion is it's far less likely something really stupid will happen. A lot of people are in support of scaling in one way or another and the main disagreement is how to go about it, but we still have some gridlock about it.
The worst case scenario is bitcoin remains as it is and the market adjusts. **Oh no blocks are full and transactions are expensive, I'm going to AltCoins!**, fewer transactions on the bitcoin blockchain and then the costs drops and transactions are faster again and cheaper...
But imagine if something stupid was proposed, such as raising the 21 million cap, or eliminating the cap and rewarding miners more bitcoins indefinitely.
**Good. Fucking. Luck.**
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:21:09


I'll be honest, if we have some sort of major collapse of the internet, Bitcoin will be the least of our worries. I support scaling, I'm not even against BU scaling options.
But what turns me off is the whole 'confederation', I wonder if Bitcoin core implemented their scaling code exactly, would they continue to push for BU, when Core copies their scaling?
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:10:07
it may not be actually, large traders pay very little fees
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:06:00


that doesnt mean its backed by 1 usd like you said. you are backtracking now, the real tether volume is on kraken and the volume is nothing
its one thing to make a coin backed by usd and it trades for 1 usd because its backed by 1 usd, but if the whole point of the coin is to track usd and the usd doesnt back it the coin is worthless. people just have not figured it out yet.
but they will in time
bitcoin doesnt claim to be backed by us dollars
if bitcoin clamed to be backed by 4000 usd and in reality there was no 4000 usd behind the backing then bitcoin would not be worth 4000 usd.
tether claims to be backed, is not backed by jack shit. not sure what you are so upset about
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:25:52


you spelled shorts wrong
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:58:02
oh i want to add:
tether can solve a lot of problems by publishing the pre-existing audits that the website proclaims to exist, the website claimed tethers were professionally audited prior to claim that tethers were being audited by friedman
so they should have prior audits and be able to say who was their previous auditor
either that... or the website was lying about being professionally audited 
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:02:43
actually, this can be proved to be wrong.
it started going up dramatically after they started using fake tethers to pump up the price with margin debt.
literally within minutes of $25 million in new tethers created the margin longs start to skyrocket along with price.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:54:16


and when tether explodes, so do these exchanges

yes, this can go both ways.

@_date: 2017-08-18 02:03:29


except there's a big problem.
**they do not have banking**
and there's another problem
**tethers are not legally redeemable for money**
so even if someone COULD send tether money... WHY would they buy $80m of nonredeemable tokens?
they wouldn't.
hence why I think it's fake. 
lets not forget that bitfinex has already a bad reputation for stealing customer money, 36% of it, in fact.
why in the hell would a legit institution trust bfx with that much money when they could just make their own exchange and do the same thing, there's been more tethers issued than the value of bitfinex
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:24:34
fyi i am the author of these posts.
bitfinex will likely chime in, claim that my posts are 'just fud' and not actually post any facts. they are masters at handwaving away information and people generally seem to believe whatever someone with bfx_ infront of their name says as gospel.
something very important to note about the tethers, tether is basically a bitfinex altcoin, as most of the people behind tether are behind bitfinex.
bitfinex benefitted by guiding people to withdraw from their own exchange with their own altcoin.
a withdrawal of us dollars via tether isn't a withdrawal of us dollars, it's a conversion of us dollars into bitfinex tethers which of course, as I and others have pointed out many times are backed by nothing.
drew made the fatal mistake of somewhat admitting this... calling it a use case for tether... but then failing to mention that tether still cant send people their money because of the banking problems.... meaning it cant possibly be a use case and just exports their problems to other exchanges
i also want to bring your attention to a now deleted tether page...  3 of the advisors? bitfinex
and heres an admission by bitfinex that bitfinex is a shareholder in tether
they constantly hand-wave the terms of service away like it's no big deal, it is a big deal, because legally once you convert your us dollars on bfx to tethers, they legally owe you nothing. they certainly CAN give you the money out of the goodness of their hearts, but they legally dont have to.
tethers also help with the audit, because tethers are not liabilities. they could have 300 million tethers with $1 usd in the bank and be solvent because tethers = not a claim against deposits
go to the tether website and look for the 'team' or 'about us' or if you can find out any information on who created tether or founded it... they deleted it for a reason.
they obviously have something to hide
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:37:26

the purpose is to manipulate prices, up or down, artificially
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:58:48
im as libertarian as you can get, but the one thing governments should be cracking down on is fraud.
spoofing is a form of fraud and exchanges really have no incentive to 'fix' it, as most people don't seem to care until the spoofing goes against them and by then its too late everyone loses their money

the price will do what its going to do regardless of my posts, my posts will have zero consequences on the price and i knew this all along
the price will also do what it is going to do regardless of your posts


well, except for the fact that i was the first to post the lawsuit, i said they would lose all fiat, people said fud, and then they promptly lost all fiat pretty much. everyone championed hkd/chf withdrawals, i knew that was false, and i was right.
i mean people even argued with me what was in their own lawsuit and they just would call it 'lawyer speak'...

like the fact that they didnt warn people about no withdrawals for nearly three weeks? march 23 to april 13th?
the fact that they made commissions from people that wanted to cash in USD but couldnt  and bfx already knew they couldnt?
and they make commission again by buying btc to withdraw...

easy, by using customers deposited forfeited USD from the hack to buy bitcoins slowly over time causing massive price appreciation since
they didnt lose us dollars
they lost bitcoins

wonder how many of them are heading over to bfx lmao
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:39:45
that would be up to the courts to determine
im not sure people with tethers want to wait for the slow wheels of justice to maybe get some of their money after lawyers consume up a big part of it figuring out whether they are redeemable or not
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:50:53
they never announced it
im the one that fetched the lawsuit documents and brought it up
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:10:56
there will need to be sell pressure on other exchanges before it starts to fall, the issue is right now the price is presumed to have 'recovered' and people dont want to sell just yet on other exchanges
nobody is going to want to sell on bitfinex because.... they cant get the USD.
only idiots will sell on finex or people speculating that they will eventually get those withdrawals
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:14:25
the way it works is when bitfinex wanted to send usd to someone with a us bank account, they would send money from their taiwanese bank, their tw bank would send it to their partner wells fargo, wells fargo then would send it to the final destination bank, whether its a wf account or non-wf account like chase/bank of america/whatever.
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:57:20


do you think they wont do that same game to the peoples money they are holding? lets also not forget that this is already legally questionable and could result in their accounts getting frozen or seized either by the bank when they figure it out, or by regulators.


pushing the legal boundaries with hundreds of millions of dollars of other peoples money is irresponsible as fuck.


sure, but they could face even more severe criminal penalties.
however, if they try to do the cup and balls game and sell worthless tokens which warn buyers that they are in fact worthless, its a bit more of a grey area. tether isn't a scam in the legal sense because they warn you that they are not money, not redeemable, etc etc.
so if they do run off with the money, and you sue, they are going to point right to those terms and say sorry pal.


the exchange for all intents and purposes failed back in august, running an exchange makes good money, so you would want to try and keep it up and running as much as possible.
the reality is you have to ignore the giant shell game they have with their corporate structure, i only show that to show people that despite their attempts to distance themselves from tether saying its not the same company yada yada, they are closely related.
the shell game is an attempt to protect against liability. tether can shut down, distribute the proceeds to shareholders, and you have no one to sue and the money is gone.
@_date: 2017-04-23 05:59:18
their lawyers claim that bitfinex and tether are really not the same companies but corp structure says otherwise

you cant build a house on sand and expect the water to not wash it away
the people who buy into this fake rise will be the first to rush out, the exchanges where you can sell on have significantly less liquidity than bitfinex
this will be a total disaster
bitcoin will survive but the price will in the end take a massive beating
right now the entire rise from 900 to 1300 can be attributed to the withdrawal problems, the rise started... around march 23rd. people could not withdraw fiat and bought btc to try and get out
they see the price rising and wait trying to time their exit.
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:26:29


the fact that a few withdrawals slipped through the cracks at their banks doesnt mean i was wrong
they cant send chf/hkd right now at all per their own website
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:39:27
just buy bitcoin and sell it on another exchange, btc withdrawals are functioning as normal
what i suggest you do is do a small test transaction on the new exchange you sell on to make sure their withdrawals are working
@_date: 2017-04-24 02:11:35
did you look? 
@_date: 2017-04-28 07:46:52
correct, they can certainly choose to pay back tethers at face value but they are under no obligation to do so legally
they are basically, legally car wash tokens

so far everything i told them that was going to happen, happened.

based on bfx's corporate structure, tethers and bitfinex really are joined at the hip.
they are not truly a third party as much as you want to make them out to be
this is why i constantly post the corp structure so people see this

@_date: 2017-04-28 16:02:33


there will never be an audit. they have been promising this forever.


i've been telling people that the price will skyrocket as a result, people even laughed at me when it didnt go up, i could have simply got back in when i said the price was going to skyrocket and still made a fortune, i could have gone long too and made a fortune.
i got out because i wasnt going to try and time a bubble top.
i got out too early in 2013 on some too around 875 and watched it go to 1200.
that ended up turning out to be a good deal
finally **my fucking posts will not have any impact on any prices at all** i am not trying to influence prices. i am not trying to 'buy back in', i am not 'short' on usdt. i literally lose no fucking money regardless of what happens.
buying back in before the bfx situation plays out is suicide pretty much


despite tether knowing they cant redeem tethers because of wire transfers, saying they would not increase tethers much more... tethers increased 14m since that post
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:29:29


fyi, they halted all incoming deposits not just USD
@_date: 2017-04-12 22:34:35
pretty much, they kind of admitted that in the 45 minute interview saying that banks are private and have a right to discriminate against transactions
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:06:15
here is a fun fact
tether and bitfinex are owned by the same parent company
tether on their website claims to be professionally audited
so how about you just show us the results of the last professional audit that tether has done?
or is that personal and private secret information ?
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:56:43


tether and bitfinex are not the same corporate entity = true
but tether and bitfinex **are** conjoined twins
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:58:02
objective: bitfinex customer wants US dollars
bitfinex tells -&gt; bitfinexes bank (TW) - &gt; send money to partner bank (WF) - &gt; customers bank (WF or any bank!)
this has worked for years and is how bitfinex moved money to and from their customers
WF now says no more transactions from bitfinex
bitfinex currently does not have another bank partnership. bitfinex bank cannot send -&gt; customers bank directly
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:36:33
where ?
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:40:20
yup. agree.
on their last interview they were talking about how they are looking for someone to audit their books like its some hard thing to find.
.. and im like what about the auditor who audits tether already (as claimed by the website), also havent seen the tether report... crickets from them
ill believe it when i see it.

the bubble pops when one of the two things happens:
1. bitfinex is able to resume withdrawals, gets new banking partner that wont shut them down the minute they send 2 withdrawals.
2. bitfinex exchange fails.
the price on Bitfinex started rising as people were unable to withdraw their funds after mid-march crash, as more and more bad news came out about bfx the price went higher and higher on bfx.
the price going up on bad news is illogical.
the rest of the exchanges follow bfx up, pay attention to trades. bfx moves first up, the rest follow.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:50:12
in my opinion the case will be thrown out, wells fargo has no duty to provide services to bitfinex
bitfinex should just be getting new banking partners... the trouble is any bank is going to do some research and then find this lawsuit and it will make them even more hesitant.
the only way that bfx could win, is if they had a contract with wells fargo to handle their transactions and then wells fargo decided not to honor that contract.
they have no relationship at all with wells fargo
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:10:37


no but its a bitcoin exchange and some people use bitcoins for illegal reasons
i actually think its bullshit too but thats wells fargos reasoning and legally they can block anything they want even totally legal things
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:51:49
i would not use poloniex

okay so ignore proof that i am right
i literally show their own website as proof that tethers are not money, not redeemable, which it states **multiple times** and this is not good enough proof for you or anyone here. i get called out for FUD for simply showing **tethers own website**
go buy tethers, i hear they are trading under $1.

@_date: 2017-04-07 20:50:44
who audits tether and where can we get the results of the audits
@_date: 2017-04-23 05:33:32
withdrawal problems started on 3/23. they were formally informed on 3/31.
they made no mention to anyone despite me screaming about this until 4/13
i was first to try and bring this to everyones attention and got banned for it for 'fudding'
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:03:14


actually many of the questions ive asked are pretty basic and they seem to dance around them
ive been asking about their sister company tether for audit information (which is claimed on their own website), and have got no responses
tether and bfx are basically ran by the same people both have same parent company
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:54:36
and all of the usd that backs tethers are in a bank account which can be frozen any time
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:42:03
also, you do have an opportunity to be somewhat of a guinea pig, the worst case is they credit your account back the usd and you can just buy bitcoin to get out
if you want to experiment, try making a withdrawal request with a small % of what you have and see how long it takes to go through, or if it ever does, or if you have to contact support and get it canceled
bitfinex has not been forthcoming on any information
i kind of suspect that only larger transfers may be being blocked and they are using alternative channels for the small transfers 
despite the fact that they have filed a lawsuit there are still no official announcements on their own website about withdrawal delays and its getting to the point where it is becoming more malice than simply negligence... the lawsuit is public record there is no point in not making an announcement unless it is malice
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:46:40
tethers are actually even worse than a bank... because when you put money in the bank you are a creditor to the bank
when you use tether... you are owed nothing
and 65 million of these things exist
dont forget to check my post history where tethers seemed to be issued just as they paid down their bfx tokens on bitfinex
very fishy
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:17:04
please provide audit reports from the professional auditing agency
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:02:37
just saying there was no proof of mtgox insolvency until it was too late
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:44:53


you might want to check the charts in my post
tethers increased along with bfx token redemptions
they traded debt tokens (bfx tokens) for legally, non-debt tokens (tether)
they issue 4m tethers, then pay down a bunch of bfx tokens
they issue 10m tethers, and then suddenly they pay down around 11 million in bfx tokens.
they issue 30m tethers and then pay down 24 million in tokens
those tokens are issued against usdt withdrawals from the exchange, you have 10 USD and ask for USDT, they issue 10 USDT and take your USD.
the good news is they are solvent legally, bad news for people who own tethers though being at the mercy of bfx/tether to get their money
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:42:55
bitfinex USD is in same position as USDT
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:19:43
they will never produce the audit results because they either don't exist or reveal things they don't want people to know. i have been asking for few weeks now and they duck the question. @_date: 2017-04-20 20:08:35
yes, we survived and then had a 2 year bear market.
this will have the same effect.
sorry folks
bitcoin will be fine but the current price is artificial and a bubble 
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:32:51
its too bad you withheld information on the withdrawal problems for almost three weeks from your customers and profited from commissions from people who were trying to use your services.
bfx sold services they knew they could not do and charged for them
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:30:30
would we expect them to say anything different ?
they already been caught in bullshit multiple times, brandon said wires of other currencies were going out, that turned out not to be true.
brandon probably honestly thinks they are solvent but hes just a pr guy working for his boss
people working for gox thought they were solvent too 
we cant just take their word for it on solvency they have to prove it and the only way to do that is with an audit by a reputable firm that they have been promising forever
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:34:13


most likely the case so this really isnt brandons fault hes just trusting his boss
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:24:13
except everything I said was gonna happen, happened 
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:20:50
no such thing as audits lol
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:13:06


bfx: hacked, lost most if not all bitcoins, did not lose us dollars.
mtgox: hacked.
bfx: banking relationships suspended
mtgox: banking relationships suspended
bfx responded to the hack by stealing 36% of all deposits then using their available fiat to buy bitcoins on the market to try and replenish their bitcoins, this artificial demand resulted in the price rise since last august.
bitfinex has the vast majority of orders, margin trading, in the bitcoin eco system. over 200m in estimated value is on them, including the worthless tethers owned by the same people who run bfx
and lets not forget where bfx admits to playing cat and mouse with banks and engaging in what some would argue to be money laundering.


this is why their exchange has not been audited, and their tethers which claim to be audited? no audit of that either
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:45:32
on paper i think its actually pretty close im not completely sure.
but you are buying no cash value tokens like car wash tokens
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:33:13
ok fine you go put all of your money on bfx have fun you win
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:05:13
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:36:06
except they are already supposed to have audits of tethers based on what their own website reports
yet this audit is nowhere to be found

@_date: 2017-04-09 05:05:44


it's highly unlikely that wells fargo would refuse to process a transaction to a governmental institution
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:04:45
bitfinex says there are no losts funds just they cant conduct wires until they make some new banking relationships
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:09:56
op also has a history of being correct i was the first to bring up the issue about withdrawals, the bfx lawsuit, the wire transfers would get shut down, all fiat would get shut down... and it all came true. 
anyone that doesnt believe me, just read tethers own website and come to your own conclusion. the charts i have presented dont lie
and no, i am not short usdt
@_date: 2017-04-30 05:02:02
well, a quick look at history reveals that this is a lie. lets review 03/20/2017
im no math major but 29 million in assets against 44.9 million in liabilities sounds just a little insolvent.
also right now its negative 550k
so how could this happen if tethers never issued without money in the bank
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:53:05


If you guys lose the lawsuit against wells fargo, your own lawsuit paints a pretty bleak picture


you do yourself no favors by downplaying this in public while screaming bloody murder in the lawsuit
like wells fargo lawyers dont pay attention to reddit
pro tip
**they do**
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:32:46
because they had no case, im willing to bet the lawyers they paid to do this even told them this case had no chance
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:47:55
wells fargo prevails, the tro is denied, and then other banks can point to it and say look at that we can ban virtual currency transactions too!
the lawsuit is reckless in that regard

Use Gemini 
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:51:42
See my post history, there's a lot of questions about Polo.
I kind of wonder how much of the trading is even legitimate, the best they could show me as far as cold storage was a grand total of 10k BTC in cold storage on just two addresses that were over a year old... and of course they didn't sign a message. 
It's not hard for them to fiddle the orders and make it appear like a coin is skyrocketing, to try and attract people to deposit their BTC to chase better returns. They then 'lag it' because they need to balance the books. This is of course just speculation, but they are very fishy.
With the amount of money they should be making, they can rent better servers. We're talking about six figures a day in revenue.

They are legit
@_date: 2017-04-23 04:56:29


they are not.
when they got hacked and lost btc, they essentially stole from people holding USD on their exchange to bail out the btc. they did a bankruptcy without going through the proper procedures
and they didnt pay back anything like everyone claims because nobody can actually get the usd from the tokens unless they buy bitcoin
the rise could also be caused by people who had bfx tokens but now has usd using those usds to withdraw from the exchange.... there is no other way out
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:47:20
because withdrawal in taiwan likely doesnt work

i am not a day trader
i am not trying to get back in with the vast majority of my net worth this is a horribly irresponsible move. in the event i did get back in it would obviously not be with more than 10% which even that is very aggressive.
i held on during panics and sold some at bubbles. i did not sell as a 'panic sell' i sold into a rise not a dumpening. 
and finally, all of these posts will have absolute dick effect on the price.
bitcoin is going to do what it is going to do regardless of some idiot ranting on reddit thats not what my posts are about


august 2016...


like i said before, the audit is not coming. 
to bad we cant really make a bet on it 
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:17:16
heres the thing, technically yes they can have 100% of the money to redeem everything.
**they do not legally have to redeem anything**
so, bitfinex is solvent, because people stuck with tethers are well.. stuck with tethers if they decide not to redeem
they got tethered
you cant really win an argument against tethers own legal terms and conditions
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:37:57
i guess you got kraken'd
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:26:55
this is what i think happened:
they had all of their bitcoins stolen, confiscated 36% all deposits including ones that were not stolen, used proceeds from that confiscation to buy bitcoins in the market to attempt to make people whole.
the result: fueling a new bubble since aug last year 


they lost pretty much all of their btcs
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:18:54
withdrawals have been delayed since the start of the recent price run up
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:13:30
you cant withdraw USD from bitfinex so only way out is to buy btc. artificially high price of btc due to this
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:49:01
it doesnt take a lot of bitcoin to artificially inflate the price, then more people jump in seeing the price go up.
every $1 the price of bitcoin goes up is $16 million on the market cap. a $10 increase on the btc prices only takes a few million but adds $160 million to the market cap
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:08:53
The $180M figure comes from: 
Obviously not all of the USD could be in Wells Fargo, but I'm sure it's in the millions. The question is... how much?
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:30:06


bitcoin isnt legal tender
and legal tender only applies for debts
if you owe someone a debt they must accept any legal tender

why are you sharing personal information ?
redditor for 6 weeks
seems legit
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:08:34
they claim to be professionally audited, but have not stated who the auditor is or produced an audit.
**the claims that they are not insolvent are legally true, because a tether is not a debt obligation.**
they can say they have 1 usd for every tether in their bank, but that does not mean they have to give you the 1 usd in their bank in exchange for that tether.
simply looking at their own terms proves this is correct
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:30:25
well, bfx has hit all of the mtgox checkboxes except for their bank accounts getting seized.
that will probably be next. once that happens the usd on their platform is worth 0, thats when you see the real moon, of 10-20k btc on bfx, or more. the sky high price you saw on mtgox in usd terms was a result of their usd having less market value... those fears were quite founded


@_date: 2017-04-30 17:43:09
"hey, would you like to come work for tether? you are the kind of thought leader we'd love to have on our team"
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:06:21
except that doesnt apply to tether which is supposed to be audited per the website and you have yet to post a link to the last report from the auditor of tether.
where is it ?
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:37:58


omg... just lol. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:55:05
using their numbers, they lose 50% of btc, but only give 36% haircut.
what do you think they did with the fiat? they had to go out and buy btc
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:56:27
that doesnt mean they are redeemable 
you can have full reserves and still choose not to redeem tethers 
it says so plain and simple on your own website 


There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.
just because you have the money from tether issuance doesnt mean you will honor them
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:14:30


they are a private business and they can discriminate however they want so long as its not by race, sex, religion etc
blocking transactions because you think bitcoin is fishy is perfectly fine
no way bfx would win that lawsuit it was a huge waste of money and im sure their lawyers informed them of this from the start but did their best to work for them
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:31:48
they might be suffering from same problem as bitfinex, you can send them money but they cant send you money. they know about this but dont warn people 
only way out is to buy bitcoin and deposit to another exchange to withdraw usd... and you cant use bitfinex for that
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:58:04
well we did get a very nice big price bubble from it
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:16:55


except i was, everyone knew the premium was a result of withdrawal problems but it was 'no big deal' and 'withdrawals are coming back relax guys'.
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:35:17
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:16:50
we still have a lot of margin shorts on bitfinex... 20k shorts that literally could not cover without going to 2-3k
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:23:48
they have answered questions with non-answers
they will lose the lawsuit because 1 they have no standing, 2 banks are allowed to discriminate against wire transfers, see operation choke point
the bigger question is why waste their time with a lawsuit they know they will lose, when that can be more productively used to find a better banking partner.
second... why didnt they have multiple partners already ?
and finally they have not informed anyone officially about delayed withdrawals on their website keeping their own customers in the dark
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:16:54
dont forget that tethers are unredeemable worthless pieces of shit
they are the ultimate shitcoin because they will also never increase in value they can only decrease


car wash tokens

how do you have grounds to sue? banks are allowed to discriminate against wires in compliance.

mtgox had bitcoin just not as much as they were supposed to
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:33:21


well the thing is their tether is already audited per their website so we should be asking for the results of that audit
the same people who operate tether operate bitfinex all same parent company 
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:26:27
this can be totally true, but it does not mean you have to redeem tethers. 
you can have all of the money to redeem, but legally don't have to
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:58:53
fees are 100% of your money. So for example if you buy $1000 of Tethers, you pay $1000 in fees but end up with USDT tokens which you have no claim ever to the USD's ever again.
basically think of them as nonredeemable tokens like they have at Dave &amp; Busters or other places. NO CASH VALUE


**There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.**

they are likely going to have an uphill battle finding new banking partners after they tried a bullshit lawsuit against a major bank
any bank that is going to allow you to handle tens of millions of dollars in transactions is going to do a little research on your firm and what are they going to find about bitfinex?
that they sued wells fargo in a totally fruitless and pointless lawsuit that even a deaf and blind 5 year old would know has no chance of a success.
are you going to bank with someone that seems to make such a stupid mistake  and let them use your bank and good name for tens of millions of dollars in volume?
no fucking way
 
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:47:14
only when someone finds lawsuit do they put a pr about it when they should have told people from the get go
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:58:49
what i meant was try to withdraw the usd they credited to your account, you cant without paying another commission and now buying btc at a big premium 
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:23:09
iFinex Inc. (british virgin islands), they own BFXNA (bitfinex north america), BFXWW (bitfinex world wide), and TETHER limited. 
but again, same exact people run everything
did you look at the lawsuit ?
its all there
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:36:46


the parent company of bitfinex, runs tether. tether claims to be audited **right now**
they have not produced any audits
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:37:48
the most popular way it gets answered is a post on bfx admitting I was right. Happened few times now
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:25:15
their own lawyer doesn't even disagree 
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:10:28
the volume may be artificially increased on other exchanges for few reasons:
1. people thinking they can arb on bfx for the easy $100
2. people who have shorts on bfx (19k shorts!), adding to their margin positions by buying from other exchanges and depositing on bfx
the irony is everyone who remains on bitfinex will eventually get 'stuck' like the gamblers who tried this on mtgox.
withdrawals of fiat are likely not coming back to bfx
bfx also has admitted to what is basically money laundering see here...


it has finally caught up to them
bfx prices jump first then we see increase on other exchanges, something to be aware of
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:54:27
because this is just the start
us citizens should be using us based exchanges yet most trade on foreign exchanges 
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:44:01


can they do them now ? nope
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:59:20
so then the statements in the lawsuit are false ?
that only hurts you case
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:08:51
they tell you two weeks again
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:55:59
unfortunately a cursory reading of the case leads me to believe that wells fargo will prevail and then other banks will have legal precedent that they too can stop wires relating to virtual currencies
 this should have been handled much more quietly with no lawsuit and just find another way to accomplish the same thing
making a lawsuit means you are making noise and bringing attention to yourself, attention you may not want
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:44:55
except bitcoin doesnt proclaim to have a fixed value against us dollars or claim to be backed by anything
@_date: 2017-04-19 00:42:59


it gets worse.
read the legal agreement, the tethers are not backed by their USD funds at all.
when i was researching tether and probing them about an audit (which doesnt exist), decided to read the legal agreement... **jackpot**.
tethers are tantamount to car wash tokens... except you cant even wash your car with them
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:31:08


@_date: 2017-04-20 14:54:27
their current solution involves convincing their lawyers to launder the money for them
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:48:07


yes, they are
1. people stupid enough to try and arb
2. people funding their underwater margin shorts on bfx
3. people thinking price rise is organic and getting in with new demand (FOMO'ers)
bfx has always moved first with a price jump and other exchanges follow immediately with bots
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:51:09
customers also ate commission fees when bitfinex didnt tell their clients for almost 3 weeks that there were no usd withdrawals

how does USD show up with no wire transfers? 14 million new tethers issued since 04/18 despite no wire transfers since 3/31 at the latest
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:52:59
well here is some evidence of fishy business
1. dont tell depositors they cant withdraw usd until they try and fail (evidence: 
2. dont tell depositors you are engaged in lawsuit against us bank (
the best way to get out of bitfinex right now is to buy bitcoin, they have not had withdrawals processed since late march and... would you look at that... the price of bitcoin since late march has risen by over $300.
something is wrong folks, this is your canary in the coal mine. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:48:14
that was the news all along, got banned from bitcoinmarkets so can't reply there but you might want to patch up your post to correct it
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:17:28


they sued wells fargo april 5th they could have told customers then about the issues but they waited until april 13.


you have btc, you want usd, you sell on bfx thinking you can get usd but bfx already knew they cant give you usd.
you try to withdraw usd, bfx says no sorry cant do it
you buy btc again
bfx made 2 commissions when they already knew they could not do the service you went on there to do

the corporate structure has tether joined at the hips with bitfinex, either you are misrepresenting things, or the corporate layout is false
if the corporate layout i have posted is false, prove it
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:25:19
none of them had as much liquidity as bfx...
so if there is a panic and people actually want to get their dollars for their btc they will have to sell on lower liquidity exchanges making the price even more volatile
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:58:32
collection of all relevant information on the lawsuit is available here
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:37:14
except i didnt figure out the corporate structure, someone else did.
they are either true or false. which is it 
your own lawyers admitted that finex own a % of tether you are not just customers 
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:06:49
technically &lt; 50% can be 49%/51% partnerships. so he could be telling the truth but its still the same people

nah dont say that we hear from them but they just wont answer the questions

i also didnt sell 65m of nonredeemable tokens 
believe the tether website. not me.

We don't know how much bitcoin has been bought with fake money, they print money, put it on margin, then buy bitcoin on fake credit...
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:06:22
they can't even afford a phone number
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:06:54
oh yeah, try to withdraw the money
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:49:18
40% of 65 million? 26 million.
technically, since tethers are not debt owed by tethers, that 26 million can be used to pay off tokens.
but really the corporate structure is a giant shell game, they are all the same people pretty much.
chances are the main reason why they cant show their audit is because:
1. the audit they claim to have on the site doesnt actually exist
2. they cant pass the audit because the bank accounts are all intermingled with each other
3. even if they in fact did have the money, **tethers are not their liability**
remember that tether on their website claims to be audited **right now** by professionals. just needs to post the last audit report
so where is the audit ? i want to see that audit report.
you have 65 million dollars of peoples money. lets see the report that is supposed to exist right now
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:16:40


funny story actually.

Well a lot of people bought bitcoin in order to buy into ICO's, same with ETH

last time they created 80, massive price pump and ended up in lending

they have one available right now.
they won't release it or show it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:49:20
Here's the thing, ETH trades against bitcoin, if everyone buys ETH to buy ICO's... that means it can become cheaper to buy Bitcoin, to Buy ETH, to then buy the ICO.
So bitcoin rises too.

Bitfinex was founded by ponzi scammer, the CFO was busted for selling counterfeit software in the 90's, the CSO had his career torpedo'ed in the 90's by the NY Times for horrible judgement.
Bitfinex performed an illegal bankruptcy, sold an illegal/unaudited security/corporate valuation.... they admit to thinking about doing fraud, they admit to bank fraud, money laundering, the list goes on and on.
The chances that I am wrong are equal to the chances of the earth being flat and ruled by lizard people.

BTC-E had tether withdrawals (and continues to have tether on their new exchange), means a lot of dirty money needs to be cleaned up through 'bad investments'
1. issue a worthless ico scam
2. have dirty bitcoin buy into your ico
3. your ico turns out to be a bad investment and you keep the money
4. dirty bitcoin guy lost all his money shucks
eos and tether = same founders
tether = bitfinex
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:39:56
Tether took money from BTC-E, and continues to integrate with BTC-E's new exchange.
Tether likely already has death warrant signed they just haven't broke the door down yet, took them 6 months from the death warrant on BTC-E to breaking the door down.
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:16:20
Sounds to me like bitcoin may be too risky for you. Sell them now and when it recovers buy back in.
Safe bet.

@_date: 2017-05-24 19:08:06
so question for you...
when you bought at around $8 and then panic sold at $300... you were still wildly in the green. you made a fortune even though the price was very depressed.
you say you bought back in over 1k... do you think there will be a different dynamic to emotions if the price short term goes back below 1k?
because at that point you are actually losing money, vs just losing paper gains but still wildly in profit.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:56:38
if bitfinex was going up as a result of a panic, and other exchanges were following it up, if that stops, the price might start to go back down.
but as more people start to panic as more time goes on without withdrawals it could go back up too

There is **no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.**
i hate to say it but you may have gotten tethered...

simply google their address and find out how many businesses are registered at their 'office'...
poloniex volumes dwarf every other exchange, they are the only us exchange that does not even accept us dollars. (fyi: tethers are not us dollars and are actually a scam, read their fine print about how tethers are not money or redeemable)
if look at the other us exchanges, we know who they are, and they have real offices.
you can actually go visit coinbase in their... real office and get a tour if you wanted.
if you go to poloniexs offices youll find some people there who wont even know who poloniex is
the owner of poloniex has never even been interviewed despite arguably having the most successful exchange
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:30:08
right fucking here.
dont forget guys that they also engaged ledger labs, then that fell thru, and they never told anyone until the other day. 
i guess we will see if they actually pass this audit 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:02:39
gee if only people have been warning about poloscam
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:18:15
okay maybe I mis spoke... some virtual offices are in fact a few hundred bucks a month for mail forwarding and all that good stuff
but still, millions of dollars a day in revenue and you can't afford a real office, with real location, and you can't even get real bank accounts for your exchange.
gemini and coinbase do a fraction of the volume you guys do and they have banking. do you mean to tell me that you can't afford a real bank account? come on now
you're simply just another cryptsy. 
the other thing is you're offering margin trading, peer to peer lending, and other such nonsense that even bitfinex cant offer us citizens anymore because of CFTC and us regulations so the chances of you getting regulatory fines is damn near 100%
which is why you guys are so evasive about where you really are and why the use of empty virtual offices and no bank accounts.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:11:25
nothing but a bunch of ghosts and virtual $39.99/month 'offices'.
