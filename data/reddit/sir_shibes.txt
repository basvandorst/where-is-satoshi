i'm pretty sure everyone is panicking right now trying to get their btc onto exchanges so they can trade it for bch before btc's value drops to 0 (or something like that)

@_date: 2017-11-12 18:59:08
i don't know, why don't you?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:58:58
are you ok?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:12:43
well, btc is down about 14% and bch is up about 151%. i guess i'm not completely sure either
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:58:44
it's not lost, but it will take longer than usual to get confirmed. there are transaction acceleration services you can use that might help to get it confirmed a little more quickly
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:17:29
that won't matter soon
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:04:00
i wouldn't be so sure just yet
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:57:18
i don't have to do anything and i can say whatever i want. bch is simply btc as it was always meant to be. it does everything btc does more simply and elegantly
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:18:21
if you say so
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:41:14
are you 12?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:08:47
not really
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:53:38
unfortunately, there are around 175k transactions waiting to be confirmed - 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:28:10
it's not over
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:17:49
those miners are actually mining bitcoin cash right now
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:19:59
because he's a lot smarter than you
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:14:56
and not the everyday, normal people like you and me?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:06
i do understand. as much as you want it to be, bitcoin cash isn't a scam
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:19:31
so scary
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:14:55
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:02:48
oh ok
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:14:36
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:40:05
it's unlikely that btc and bch will coexist in the future
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:08:30
makes you wonder
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:10:45
my judgement says to take sides with the group you're painting as being angry and evil, sorry
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:09:28
who do you think "they" might be?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:48
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:16:41
161k unconfirmed transactions and climbing
