To me it's due to knowing how bitcoin works and why fiat is terrible.  Fiat is outdated.  It's inevitable that bitcoin will make a major impact in some point.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:21:44
Wow!!!  Very bullish!!!
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:34:12
Heh, what if bitcoin turns out to be the weapon in the next revolutionary war?
Like say the next election comes and Trump gets elected again and decides to sign a bill making bitcoin illegal to buy, he'll have half the nation trying their best to buy it to go against him.
Watch all the high up Dems start pouring money into it.  
Trump has to make America great again.  America was only great when the USD was worth more and would get you further.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:01:36
That'd be nice.  What would be the reason for it shutting down?  Due to regulations?
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:40:02
Ahhhh, that's what that means.  I always thought something oddball happened that they got left unconfirmed.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:20:08
Don't you need the same things to open up a bank account?  Bitcoin is money.  This is also for money laundering purposes.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:05:46
Haha they're busy making sandwiches in the kitchen
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:49:44
Been thinking the same thing.  Like this time it's legit.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:03:02
Don't worry man, bitcoin exploding is inevitable while the USD sinks.  You made a good choice.  
I'm using bitcoin as another bank account myself.  I feel like my money is more secure in it than it would be in a bank.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:18:43
Lol how come bitcoin hodlers always want lambos?  I'd rather buy a ferrari instead.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:20:12
Welcome to the family.  It took me a bunch of time as well.  Knowledge is power, Bitcoin is freedom.  Glad to have you on board.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:16:23






Money as in US dollars, which is over inflated and not worth what it used to be.  Before you you call cryptocurrency a drug, open your eyes and look around you.  USD is a drug.  People will kill left and right for it.  
Bitcoin is freedom.  That should be the official slogan.
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:46:47
Bitcoin is basically my 3rd bank account right now.  To be honest it actually feels really good.  I feel like my money is safer and upgraded over fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:39:12
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:31:31
Heh, here's something no one thinks about.  The US presidential election is around then as well.  This time it'll be ULTRA heated on both sides that people will be more inclined to just say fuck it, and look into and buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:15:50
Everyone thinks the same about me when I tell them.  Don't worry man, eventually they'll all come around.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:29:29
Oddly enough I am too.  I think people are overlooking at how massive of an impact the 2020 election will be.  I think McAfee knew this and is what he based his prediction on.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:45:10
There's nothing more powerful in the world than redefining what money is.  Think about it.  If everyone in the world collectively decided that the USD was worthless it's a more powerful weapon than guns, tanks, and bombs.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:22:48
Exactly!!!  Once you dig deeper down the rabbit hole you start to realize just how far it goes.  Bitcoin can change the entire world from the ground up, every....single...aspect of it.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:23:46
Pretty much right.    
I'm just as baffled on why others can't see it either.  Once we hit another ATH then asses will start to move once again.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:44:35
Your bitcoin are always online, on the thousands of nodes that host the ledger.  Your Ledger Nano is just merely a key that lets you get to it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:09:17
And this is exactly why I fell in love with bitcoin.  It's a silent revolution, it's inevitable, and it's one of the best inventions ever conceived.  
It's single handedly opening our eyes and making us question what a storage of value is in the world.  
One by one all global currencies will fall and we will have chosen the right path from the beginning.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:13:11
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck yeah!!
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:15:36
Because Trump will most likely end up winning which will cause an all out war against the government using bitcoin as the weapon to topple the government.
As far fetched as it sounds, I could totally see something like that happening.  
Man, do you know just how major this upcoming election will end up being!!  If you thought the last one was entertaining, then this one will cause some crazy ass protests all over the place.  
The Democrats don't have a good candidate either.

@_date: 2019-07-25 12:16:50
Another issue to overcome is the psychological distinction that a "coin" is more the thing to obtain because coins to us are lesser than dollars.  
What would help would be if all exchanges started listing sats instead of bitcoin to buy.  
The general public thinks it's stupid to own 0.00000001 bitcoin because they compare it to a USD coin.  Owning 1 sat sounds better.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:05:40
Bakkt is dropping it on purpose to accumulate.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:07:49
Heh, I just used the same terminology the other day.  I predicted to my friends that after Trump wins 2020 we'll get into this weird second revolutionary war, except bitcoin will be the weapon of choice to topple the government.
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:04:00
The best thing you can do is vote for Trump.  Then angry citizens will buy into bitcoin to fight against him.

I'd be more worried about the USD hyperinflating one day than the volatility of Bitcoin.
What would happen if one day the USD is worthless?  Do you think the local bank will let everyone withdraw every dollar they own all at once?
This is plan B.  Better tech, smarter money, no 3rd party control.

Beautiful explanation.  I've never thought it from that angle and I understand it all.

Perfect OP, perfect.  I share the same thoughts.  It'll soooooo happen too.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:27:12
Welcome to the future
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:47:13
If I go to a store now and I want to pay for a product I will pull out my credit card, stick it in the POS device, have it approved, then be off on my way.
In the background to that process the store needs to pay fees for that POS device which in turn ups the price of products to compensate.  Also in the background through the transaction, after the approval handshake, the transaction takes 3-5 business days to go from your bank account to the super market.
The way bitcoin works solves all this.  Eventually it'll be upgraded to mimic swiping a card, and the LN is pretty much that, but the seller in my scenario above won't have to pay anyone for the privilege of the POS machine.  
The other alternative of course is paper money, which can change hands quick, but we know where that's headed.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:47:40
Right there with you bud.  I feel the same way.  I'm scared shitless to lose it all as it's a lot of money, but something in me tells me that it's inevitable it'll cause this big financial revolution in life.
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:19:38
How are they going to enforce the ban?  Also won't the USD just keep constantly inflating in the mean time and eventually implode?  
If anything, bitcoin will be kept alive by countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:26:59
Hahaha right! ��
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:26:55
Hahaha I just wrote the same thing to my friends.  What an idiot!!  This upcoming election is going to be awesome.  Now all the dems will buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:56:15
Could be too, not even joking
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:13:15
This is why you hodl and never turn it back into fiat.  It defeats the purpose of it all.
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:45:10
Or there could be a remote wallet killswitch in case someone stole the physical hardware wallet
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:45:35
Solution = Buy a Ledger Nano S and get your crypto off exchanges in general.  It gives you huge peace of mind, trust me.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:28:44
No on both
@_date: 2018-09-23 07:04:27
When you deeply think about what Bitcoin and blockchain will bring to this world you know just how inevitable it is that this will succeed.  Be glad you got in early because when this explodes you're going to love it.
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:30:14
Lol at first I thought, "That's so damn stupid to do" then I let it sink in a little bit and changed my mind.  That's actually pretty brilliant.  Say in a 100 years for some odd reason a bitcoin would equal the most enormous amount of wealth in the world, then it would make for a legit treasure hunt.  
Haha, you should get, "Vires in numeris" engraved on the tombstone

More so, how will a thief know for sure that thier effort to rob you will guarantee them money?  Even if they were to steal your wallet they'd have to extract your private key.
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:33:35
Yeah, exchanges will probably be the next banks I'm sure.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:04:31
This is exactly why I never got into bitcoin til now.  I knew about it 10 years ago when messing around with Facesniff at the time.  I always thought if I bought into bitcoin I could easily have all my money stolen from me or be a victim of ID theft somehow.
Then later on I see that people lost a crazy amount of bitcoin with Mt Gox and I was like, "Nooooooo way!!  It's a bubble, this will pop, and it'll be the end of it"  
This past December my friend got me into crypto and finally got the chance to sit down and learn how it all works.  I finally understood it all and realized that all those years I was stupid to not invest.
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:28:34
Well hopefully by then exchanges will give people insurance on their crypto and essentially turn into bank accounts.
Hardware/software crypto wallets = personal wallet
Wallets on exchanges = bank account
People will want to put their crypto in ChaseCoinbase so that you don't have loads of it in the house.  Hell if anything it'll be more advantageous for crypto in general if you can never tell how much money you have by visual sight alone.
Who would more likely get robbed, someone who has thousands of dollars laying around the house or someone who has Nano S's laying around and I'm talking about after crypto has taken over.  
Heh, it's going to be kind of cool in the future when it's pay day during the week.  Your employer will transfer crypto directly to your exchange wallet and you'll be able to set up transferring smaller portions of crypto to your personal wallet on you automatically.  This will completely eliminate ATMs altogether.
@_date: 2018-08-03 02:11:03
Lol exactly the scene I've thought about before pertaining to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-05-14 15:53:56
I had thoughts like the OP but then you know what makes me feel better, it's knowing that there's such a low adoption rate at this point that no matter what you invest you'll see big money.
When this explodes beyond what anyone ever thought you will be good.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:14:47
Except that if you wanted to you could zoom in really close on the area before the huge surge on the top graph and and it would look like the bottom one.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:23:00
It's more so blockchain adding a security ability to the flow of information back and forth.
Currency is only one application of it, hence Bitcoin.  Wait til it's integrated into websites, web browsers, POS machines, bank ATMs, etc.
It's going to interesting when we live in the time where there aren't data breaches by big companies because blockchain helped prevent it.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:22:35
Curious question for everyone.  What's the most secure bitcoin paper wallet generator if certain websites can't even be trusted like this.  Like what would you do otherwise to generate a paper wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:00:00
Isn't a 51% attack almost impossible as you have to find more than half the scattered nodes out there and change their code.  Right now that's over 5000 nodes.  How would someone accomplish this?
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:06:40
No.  Prices of fees go by how congested the network is.  So say the price doubled tonight, but then for the next 4 days it stayed the same due to lack of activity then the fee would lower but the price would stay the same.
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:31:39
Interesting.  So then someone out there probably made an address generator program.  Or hell, couldn't you save a copy of the paper wallet generator website locally on your PC, disconnect from the internet, and make a new address this way.
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:01:35
Haha, I was thinking about writing this too
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:12:31

I was thinking on my break, "Damn WTF!!  How is something so massive like this not more known or realized"
It's like it opens your eyes from the fog.  Even just the mere knowledge all of this has brought has been major.  I never knew how screwed we were til I learned about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:40:33
Of course the FUD comes out when the price dips
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:31:38
Luckily I bought myself a Ledger Nano when I started accumulating, but man, I was never aware paper wallets were this unsafe.    
The reason I asked was that I just recently read up on them and thought it would be neat to give to people to get them started on bitcoin, but with such flaws why on earth would anyone ever generate one like this?  
Is it possible to make a legit paper wallet offline that's actually secure?
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:02:51

People can't fathom 1btc = 1 million USD because everyone psychologically think Bitcoin should be cheap due to it's history.
People forget that it can be broken down into 8 decimals called satoshi.  Exchanges NEED to start listing in these to make everything make more sense.

@_date: 2019-11-21 22:45:12
Bitcoin removed FRICTION from sending/receiving money?
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:25:51
I'm going based on real world observations.  
I've worked in a restaurant before and literally the entire kitchen staff were people from El Salvador.  The cook straight up told me how he had to smuggle his daughter in.  
Wake your ass up man!!  Money is literally at the root.  Money is fucked in general.
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:55:31
I'm dissatisfied in the way the naming of it clashes with the psychology making certain amounts seem novel to people.  
Like for instance.  1 bitcoin started out to be affordable to obtain so 1 was the standard.  Now as the price increased people are buying amounts like 0.00200000 bitcoin which technically sounds stupid and makes people not take it serious enough.    
The whole naming structure needs a complete overhaul on every site you see online.  Everything should change to say 200000 sats instead of 0.00200000 bitcoin.  Then people won't think they're buying a tiny percentage of a whole.
@_date: 2019-11-04 02:39:30
Right!  So true.  Any electronic transaction made is just merely just a promise within the system that at some point it'll go through, 3-5 business days.  It's never instant.
The only instant thing about it is someone giving you a receipt and telling you that you could leave with the items in hand.
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:24:51
My thought is how fucking long it's going to take for the rest of society to question money in general and hop on board
@_date: 2019-11-15 02:21:39
True.  Dynamic pricing of everything would have to be taken into effect.
Heh, it'd be weird to see a candy bar at 1 sat one day and 4 sats the next because someone inherited 100 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:17:26
Exchanges should start listing amounts in sats already.  The average person gets dissuaded from buying in thinking like "Ugh 1 bitcoin is $10K, that sucks!!".  Most people don't know you can spend fractions of it.  
Everyone has in their minds dollars and coins.  Coins are basically a fraction of a dollar.  When they hear bitcoin they just automatically link it to being a small amount and if 1 bitcoin is $10k they think it's stupid to spend that amount on such a small thing.
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:41:32
Remember this fact; 
When you go to the store to buy something and pay with your credit card it takes 3-5 business days for all the money to fully resolve from your bank account to the store.  In those 3-5 days it's merely marked as pending.
Bitcoin however waits for confirmations that may take 10 minutes to hours depending on how much fee you want to pay.
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:50:51

@_date: 2018-10-01 17:28:27
Yeah, everyone and their mother is anticipating it.  I don't think it'll happen either.  We'll probably get this huge bull run at a time when everyone will think it'll crash further like mid Feb, just watch.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:52:56
Actually now that I think about it, probably not.  There would have to be some connection online as whatever is generating it would need to connect to the Bitcoin ledger to do it.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:54:47
Why would it not go up when it fixes whats wrong with fiat in general?
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:39:55
This is so not good for bitcoin that there aren't more warnings against these websites.  Up until now I wasn't aware these sites were that much of a flaw.  I mean sure, common sense would tell you that anything generated online in that fashion wouldn't be secure in the long run, but I thought there was still a little bit of a safe disconnect just enough to make it a viable option.  
Such eye opening and why are these sites even up still.
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:12:54
Summed it up pretty good
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:26:27
Unfortunately I have the pessimistic view on it.  If it ever goes higher it's going to take forever.  More and more people have to learn what it is and how it's used.  Negative articles are a bane to it's existence.

Lol instead of bitcoin and in the year 2018, say it was Apple Inc in the late 1970's.  Does that kid now need parenting for being obsessed and investing in a future billion dollar company?  
The fact of the matter is that you know the truth otherwise you wouldn't be on this bitcoin sub.  
The dad is parenting right because the OP is probably a dick of a son, but parenting wrong as well by playing down something he doesn't understand.
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:34:08
Bitcoin may take forever to catch on, sure, but in that time you can be sure that fiat will go down in flames.
Lol with all the global economic tension we have where else can we turn to?
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:21:49
2013-2016 were a pretty rough span of years.  All we can do is keep waiting and waiting....
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:41:19
Whatever the solution is is better than what we have now.  Basically we have the USD which is constantly inflated due to it being constantly printed out of thin air.  
Anyway, I'd hope that if this all got to mass adoption that people would have multiple wallets out there.  1 major savings and 1 spendable wallet.  
The situation you named is probably why exchanges will keep existing and turn into something like banks, because people will always need some sort of insurance in case they forget something.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:20:28
Oh man you got it.  I always trust giving away money to random people online.

@_date: 2019-11-07 15:02:44
Sorry to have triggered you, but it's the truth.  Personally I don't care that people come here to live their lives, but as a whole people want to come here from all over the world to make money and live a better life.
It's the truth!!  It shouldn't be like that.  It's literally just easier to live here and find a job.  
Tension right now in the world a so much higher than it used to be and it's due to many many many factors.  I'm not trying to single that issue out, but it partially plays into it as other things.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:29:56
Well probably.  I mean say 100% of the population used Bitcoin as the main form of currency.  Wouldn't everything just be priced accordingly to that which would end up making it stable?  
What would make the value go up or down at that point if national currencies cease to exist?
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:24:24

Really??  That's stupid!  Ugh, what a waste.  That makes no sense why.  You might as well just keep your stuff on an exchange.  
Ahh, probably because they give you the option for an on ramp, but can't you just not enable that and still use the wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:22:37
Yeah of that much there will probably be a little more than half actually in circulation

If that doesn't work for you then either A)you're refusing to give up personal info (which I don't blame you) or B)you don't have a normal bank account.

Because no matter which way you cut it bitcoin will always be the standard which everything else is based off of.  Hell, if something actually does happen with alt coins even if the OP only bought bitcoin he could always buy alts when he wants to.
It was actually smart he/she diversified because the next time bitcoin explodes eventually alt coins will too and then they could just resell and dump the profits back into bitcoin.
You did good OP except for Ethereum Classic.  Sell that shit asap.

You could use the Nano S as almost like a money safe, and the X can be like a carry on wallet.  Keep 90% of the funds on the S and 10% on the X in case you wanted to buy something from someone who accepts bitcoin.

Progression of money through technology is inevitable.  Bitcoin/blockchain will never die.  It is here to stay whether we like it or not.  It is a sleeping giant that will wake up and explode.  Rejoice this time when you can invest while still being cheap.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:40:26
I figured the way it is now everything has a set retail price.  Those prices change over time according to the inflation in the currency.  A 50 cent candy bar is now $1.
Well with bitcoin being adopted fully wouldn't prices to items have to be dynamic in that they would change every second based on who's holding all the bitcoin?
Like say 1% of the population owns most of the bitcoin floating around, prices would more reflect according to what the 99% of the population could afford.  So thus anything ultra expensive would have to be worth lower in price otherwise whatever business is selling won't make any profit due to only being able to sell to that 1% of the rich population.
It's hard to put my thoughts into words, but maybe you understand the gist of what I'm trying to say.  
Places like Walmart and Amazon will probably come up with some algorithm that scours every wallet on the blockchain to see how much they're all holding and mathematically compute fair prices to every day items based on how much worth people put into them
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:13:11
I came to a thought earlier about how the entire world's money will funnel into it.  It'll inevitably just happen and by the end a million dollars won't buy you a coin.  
In all this time all the governments fighting against it will work for it, because by the time it takes over the USD will be so worthless that you'd have to print billions to get a piece of bitcoin.  
The fun thing will be that in future elections we'll probably elect a president based more on how he/she can help in a more humanly fashion rather than have it all be about money.  Maybe the government will be more in charge with providing people healthcare rather than making money.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:42:01
It would make all the rest in circulation worth more.  Lol death is almost like the inflationary aspect to bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:19:22
Ah so the gears keep on turning for development.  Well that's good to hear.  I thought it was ready, but exchanges were resisting using it for some flaw or something.

Yeah we're in the situation now, but when you add inflation into the mix it causes problems.  The USA middle class is shrinking, houses are becoming more expensive, and products aren't made or cost what they used to.
I mean hell, we elected Trump in office to make America great again right?  Making America great again means that he wants to bring the American dream back to the people of the nation.  It's impossible at this point when 1% owns most of the wealth.

Hell, if anything in the future the biggest whales will be the owners of exchanges.  At some point they'll get bought out or merge with banks.  Calling it right now that Chase and Coinbase will merge, just watch.
Any crazy rich CEO who doesn't get into it now will pay a fortune to get into it later.  Companies like Amazon will have to start accepting Bitcoin at some point if they want to stay relevant and accumulate.
Here's the thing, who are the whales now?  If they're primarily exchange owners then they will have prices on their heads of the banks that will go under.
If they're early adopters who've accumulated when it was cheap, then they'll keep making money manipulating until all their shorts are liquidated or just sell everything at their set "I'm going to retire" price point.
The common man "anchor" investors will just keep increasing as time goes on totally messing up whales.  On the flip side whales will always emotionally control new buyers and make money off them unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:37:25

It's because of the technology driving bitcoin.  Many people came to the same conclusion that bitcoin is going to revolutionize money with the way it works so due to this it is valuable.
I mean a bitcoin isn't just this arbitrary thing, it's a feat of computer engineering and cryptography.  It's like someone painting the Mona Lisa in computing.  
It would behoove you to look up how bitcoin works so you could understand.

USD is doing the same
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:03:01
Of course not.  Whales will always be whales.  What people need to realize now is that all the non-whales have a lot of money anchored into it constantly being stockpiled by more non-whales.
It doesn't matter what whales do, people will learn, understand, and believe in this silent revolution, so they'll just keep holding through crashes to get back their funds and once they get them back they'll most likely keep the money in.  It's all psychological.
If someone bought a bitcoin in Dec 2017 for 20k, then kept holding, see it drop to 3k, and by that time learned the ins and outs.  Most likely they will have never sold through the crash and the money is still in the system.  Now new money is piling up on top.  It'll keep happening.  
Think about it, if you're invested in a FOMO period, then lose worth, and regain it back to profit, why on earth would you then sell it all and leave the entire space?

I'm hoping for the best.
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:30:35
But wait, how is a second transaction sent to interfere with that first one?
Like for instance, say I open up Samurai wallet, have an x amount of bitcoin, and I send a transaction to a store.  How do you send another transaction to interfere with the path of the first one?
I you wrote, " Not to "cancel" but "invalidate". This occurs by getting another transaction that uses at least one of the same UTXOs, and gets confirmed. Thus the earlier transaction (the one the merchant saw), becomes invalid once the double spend transaction is mined.", but how does the average person accomplish that?
@_date: 2019-02-24 04:59:03
I hope all altcoins rise with Bitcoin so they could get to the amount I bought them at, then sell them, and put it all into Bitcoin.
When I started I bought a lot of other stuff til Bitcoin finally made perfect sense to me.  Now I agree anything else is garbage.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:19:04
They probably wouldn't earn as much exchanging money than being paid the same wage as someone else doing the same job in another country.  
Having a world economy would eliminate the incentive to outsource a job.  Jobs are usually outsourced to begin with so the CEO could make more money paying people less.  
One economy throughout the world would blur the lines of where best to produce goods and services since everyone would be paid the same whether you're in one country or another, thus eliminating all the stigma due to illegal immigration.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:23:46
It'd be impossible to go to zero.  Even if everyone sold every Bitcoin they own there would still be money trapped in the space of people who bought in, but lost their private keys or died.

What if whatever is made includes some kind of NFC chip on it to interact with a POS system to which connects online.
Maybe one of those coins you see with an NFC chip inside written with a smart contract to spit out a private key to move that specific amount of money.  Then you hold it up to the POS machine to have it execute the instructions.  
Ha, just watch that this is going to be the answer to adopting bitcoin in the end, conjuring up a functional physical version of it.  Everyone's biggest argument is that it doesn't exist in physical form so why not make it and actually have it do something.

You see the issue is psychology.  Everyone feels like they need a 3rd party to watch their money, just in case.  Just in case of what?  You misplace the device that holds your life savings?  I'd rather be the person in charge of all my money than have it sit in a bank.
Why not have multiple wallets?  If Bitcoin was adopted worldwide then we'd have more versatility to be able to deposit the Bitcoin we got paid into many multiple wallets.
@_date: 2019-12-27 03:57:56

Now if it hits a million what would be the point of selling it all if it's better money?  At that point I'd hope adoption starts to occur and we could pay everyday things in Bitcoin

Heh I was thinking of exactly this earlier and said it to my friends.  What if Zuckerberg believed in bitcoin's future this whole time and is only making Libra so people can buy into it and trade for bitcoin.    
They'd make the onramp that much easier for people if there is minimal KYC.

We could elect a president based on how much he/she could help people rather than have motives based upon bringing money back into the country.
In a divorce the favor of splitting money won't be tipped to the woman anymore being that it's possible to have hidden money stashed away.  In this case it's not like a bank can just seize the guy's account and take funds to their pleasing based on a settlement.  Basically prenups won't mean shit.

Everything fundamentally wrong with this country stems from our broken monetary system.  No side will win no matter who gets elected.

Let the app generate the private key to write to the card!!  That would be perfect.
Then again that'll probably cause some security issue I'm not thinking about due to NFC.
Maybe implement some type of e-fuse onto the thing so that it can't be erased, who knows.
It'd be so cool to have this card as something like pocket spending money, and use cold storage as sort of like a personal bank account.  Then instead of going to an ATM to get cash I could just load Bitcoin onto this, and tap to pay with the pocket money.
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:39:54
Because normal people are fucking retarded, and I don't mean to sound like a dick.

Well hasn't the hash rate gotten to an all time high in all that time since the 2017 bull run?  Wouldn't that alleviate the congestion?  
There aren't any problems.  It's just that adoption needs to keep growing.  If miners and nodes tripled within a year then if the network starts getting busy again we'd have the computing power to handle it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:22:15


Ah you see, I think that'll change.  This is why I think it'll solve the border crisis and it won't matter anymore where you live.  In the future it won't matter if you work in China, Mexico, Japan, or USA you'll get paid the same for the same job.

What's nuts is that it's inevitable that it'll just implode on itself.  There's no way on this Earth that the US will relieve its national debt.  More and more money will be printed and the cycle will just constantly continue til shit hits the fan.  Then what, oh hey bitcoin...  
It'll be interesting when hyperinflation hits us and everyone scrambles to banks to take out their money, but banks won't have enough physical money to give back to people.

More so in gambling I meant.  
Like it would be cool if a casino made their own coin and when you want to play a slot machine you instantly transfer the coin to it, start playing, then if you win it would autotransfer back to your wallet.
Then when you want to cash out you could just trade on the market for Bitcoin.

Everyone is giving you the technical explanation, but in layman's terms, your wallet = your private key.  So if your wallet is on an exchange then that exchange owns your private key.

Ditto on the whole psychology issue.  It's huge.  Since people are so used to whole numbered money, anything lesser is looked down upon.  
People want to own 1 bitcoin because psychologically they think a coin is lesser of a value.  Since they don't know how the system works they think anything below 1 bitcoin is crap.

Heh, I used to use this app on my phone called Facesniff in 2010 that used to hack into people's Facebook profiles.
I went to the guy's website to get an update and saw that he accepted Bitcoin donations which made me want to look it up.
I then found a forum or site where someone was lamenting so much on how revolutionary it would become and to start buying it.  It was $1 per coin at that time.
I had just had my identity stolen around that time so I wasn't going to risk buying virtual money that had no use.  I also didn't have a clue how it worked despite reading up on it.
Lol, the guy's website is still up,

Faceniff in 2011.  I was using it to mess with people's facebook accounts and the guy who made the app said, "If you want to support me donate me some bitcoin.  It's revolutionary"  
I looked it up, researched it, was about to buy some and then thought, "Man, screw that.  If I buy some with my credit card I'll probably get my identity stolen again"
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:26:08
My friend who's also computer savvy, has his own business, just said the same thing to me an hour ago.  This is what caused me to start this thread!  
He said the same thing, "It's too volatile to invest in right now".  I was like, "Who the hell is telling you to put thousands of dollars into it?  Put $20 towards it now, get hands on experience, and learn about it, then decide for yourself"  Of course it's volatile, but that doesn't matter towards the end goal.  Whether it's $1 or $20k it's a store of value that's not attached to a central authority.  Bahhhh, I hate people.

I hope you realize that it's inevitable that it'll go up in price right.  Bitcoin (blockchain) is in its infancy and the technology is going to change the way the economy works.  The gears are just being oiled right now.  Eventually big names will dip their toes into it and it'll explode.  
With the way it works it won't just disappear, especially if it solves like 90% of the problems we face with physical and electronic money today.

This is the beauty of this finite money supply.  It'll disrupt the economy so much that it'll have to force all things to revalue themselves the right way to eliminate having to get a loan to begin with.  
Loans will have to be done through smart contracts without the bank acting as a middleman after that.  Think about this, the only reason banks give out loans is to make interest off of you.  With a smart contract you could probably deal with the other party directly for small payments to finance something

Exactly!!  
I just saw on the news yesterday that minimum wage in NY is now $15/hour.  20 years ago it was $5/hour.  So where's this trend going?  How high will minimum wage be in another 30-40 years?    
My point is that the USD is screwed if every single piece of society is always trying to play catch up with inflation.  The writing is ON THE WALL of what the answer is.
@_date: 2019-01-08 13:34:25
It is and it isn't.  They're basically just a website that stores everyone's crypto wallets.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:35:13
Banks will still be banks, but they'll be a shell of what they used to be due to the finite crypto supply.  
The bigger crypto exchanges we have today will probably be bought out by banks at some point and their function will be solely to store your crypto, route it, and give you an insurance policy.  
Banks will probably go big on ATMs as well.   
Banks will probably also eliminate any walk-in places and just be completely online after that.  Actually, maybe they will have walk-in places, but just filled with ATMs, reason being is that they'll never need to handle anything physical anymore, so why hire tellers to stand in buildings?
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:55:35
Holy crap exactly!!
People's understanding of Bitcoin goes to certain levels.  Once you get to the deepest understanding of exactly the way it works it's like an enlightenment.  Eventually more and more people will understand.  In the meantime the world has to take care of a problem with money.
At some point things will collide.  It's inevitable, because this is singlehandedly better technology of the monetary system than anything a government can provide.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:01:36
The only hindrance will be human greed.  Houses and cars are only valued what they are due to inflation.  Without inflation they'd have a more realistic value.

@_date: 2018-11-29 15:08:43
I was thinking about this too one day.  Couldn't you just move all your funds off of an exchange and you'd essentially be dodging the government?  On top of that couldn't you just keep creating new wallets on other exchanges?  
That's the beauty of this type of currency, nothing connects you to a wallet unless you reveal that it's yours.
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:24:11
So I went to that coinme website and they have a KYC thing going on to redeem a ticket.  I wish this was simpler and didn't require identification.  I mean, I have accounts on sites that needed it so it's not a foreign concept and I understand why it's needed, but it's still kind of a bummer to know.  
Oh well, at least this will encourage new users to start wallets and look into it further which is good for the whole picture.

Coins aren't physically stored on the Ledger Nano S.  Instead it's your private keys that are stored and secured.  Everything is still online.  Think of the Ledger Nano S as like a realllllllllly secure key to access your wallet on your PC

The lesser hands handling the wallet the better it is.  Unless you take a trip to the Ledger factory and take your product off the line it's impossible that someone will not handle it.  You want lesser in this case.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:42:21
Economical issues will end up being resolved due to bitcoin being an absolute value of currency.
For example, Colombian drug lords sell drugs for money in the black market.  Eventually that money isn't accounted for and goes under the radar.  That screws up our economy and takes money away from the normal working citizen.  To compensate the US Govt prints out more money.  Once more money is printed it'll devalue all money in circulation causing inflation and the debt to increase.
Also I don't know too much of what I'm talking about, just trying to think it out.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:00:13

@_date: 2018-04-20 13:25:00
Maybe so, but within the last couple of months there have been a TON of times where it's gone up a lot in a minute and dipped exactly the same amount hours later.  Who knows what it is, but I think this is one of those times.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:06:26
If your basic aim is to take your thousands of dollars of crypto off exchanges then there's no reason to just not go the direct route.  Any variable you introduce whether or not the convenience can give you an issue to the end result.
Obviously however if you know the product, what it entails, what to look for, and what to do, then you can probably go to ebay, buy someone's used Nano for $60 and be fine with it.  To the person just starting to get into crypto that knows 0 about it I couldn't stress enough to get it from Ledger's website given any pain in the ass it may give you.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:13:54
I'm confused.  Why do people get it from Amazon when most of the time it's the same price as it is from the Ledger official site?
Also even used couldn't you just make a new seed given this hasn't been physically tampered with?
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:33:44
Oh man interesting.  I thought the Nano's seed words were specific to that particular device.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:05:53
Just remember that when there's a random huge increase within a minute there's always going to be an equal dip hours later.  $8,300 by noon.  Calling it now.  The whales like to manipulate.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:11:23
Regardless, unless patience is driving you absolutely crazy, there's no reason in this world to not get it from Ledger themselves unless they're completely out of stock on their website, even so it's not like it takes forever for them to stock back up.

You'll never convince them.  They're stuck in their old ways forever.  Just accumulate and hodl yourself.  They'll get it later on maybe.

Completely agree with you OP.  This is a huge problem in my book.  Everyone equates $1 - 1 btc subconsciously who have barely dove into learning about it and it ends up hurting in the end.    
What makes the situation worse is the inclusion of the word coin in bitcoin which further makes it look lesser.
Everything needs to change into satoshis on all sites.  It'd make adoption that psychologically more sound.

If 1 Bitcoin is 70 million USD I'd hope a lunch would cost a lot less than 100 satoshis.  More like 6 satoshis
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:24:02
Makes you wonder what kind of mind Satoshi had to engineer such a brilliant system.  Bitcoin is a modern day work of art.

Yeah, no joke, I actually do the same thing.  It was something taught to me in school to do when writing papers and I just do it to be proper, plus it gives me ADD when people don't do it.

As much as I'd want this to happen it won't.  New bitcoin ATH will attract more new people to invest and they won't understand crypto fully which will make alts blow up because they think they'll go up
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:34:30
Man, I just said the same thing to my friends.
Financial institutions are going to buy up Bitcoin like crazy and then banks will use it in the background and fraction it off like gold.  Banks won't go away because people are too used to them.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:10:37
Haha that would have been so awesome.  Even better Bitcoin SV.  "Here you go, this is the new bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:41:42
That's what I used to think in 2010 and what stopped me from investing when bitcoin was $1 per coin.  I had gotten my identity stolen that year randomly and I was paranoid that it would be stolen again buying "virtual money"  
Fast forward to last year and I used Coinbase to get into it.  As much flak as it gets here everything was easy and intuitive.  I educated myself on how bitcoin works and figured it out.    
I now regret not buying in back then because I thought I would get hacked.

Uninstall the chrome Bitcoin wallet and reinstall it.  Same thing happened to me recently.  It kept crashing when checking my ledger.  Uninstalling/reinstalling fixed it.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:22:13
Heh, is that why Bitcoin SV shot up just now?
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:09:29
Ugh, what a bitch.  I hope you stashed away some bitcoin in a wallet she didn't know about for yourself.

We will experience a revolution that starts with this.  In all fairness before this we never really had the means to change the system in a big way.  We got stuck in the dinosaur age when it came to money.
No one could keep their life savings at home.  If they hoarded all their money at home and a fire broke out then they lose too much.
Man oh man, this is so going to change the world.  I'm glad I'm on board as early as you fine folk.

Oh man, learn how it works, it's genius engineering.  I'm totally wowed that someone managed to think up and create bitcoin.    
Once you understand it it'll be a revelation.  This is literally money 2.0 and all of this is just a kickstarter campaign for it.

It'd be impossible.  Anyone out there could run a node.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:15:57
That's what I've always been saying.  Bitcoin is like a kickstarter campaign for money 2.0.  We currently have 228 billion invested.  I'd say that's pretty good
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:50:16
It's because people have the mentality that crypto is like fiat and that an exchange equals a bank.  Totally stupid I agree.  The thing though is that this will probably never change and psychologically will stick to the wrong way because exchanges like Coinbase will morph more into something like a bank and will probably end up insuring at some point.
