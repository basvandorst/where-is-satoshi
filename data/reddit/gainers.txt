You realize that there not being a strong historical link between deflation and depression does not prove the claim that inflation causes malinvestment, right? You're mixing up claims and it's like you don't even notice, this is why laymen shouldn't play at being economists.

It's like you're sending me a link to a lecture about how evolution isn't real and telling me to debunk it, I don't have the time or the will, nor do I see the necessity in debunking something that people far above my academic pedigree have already debunked repeatedly.

If you use the web interface, then it's not really open source since it could be changed anytime without you knowing. I guess if properly audited, using the client could work, but whatever device you're running it on needs to be online to talk to greenaddress.it and therefore could be compromised (which wouldn't do much if the service isn't also compromised, so that would still be more secure than your regular web wallet or client wallet)
I've been thinking about a seamless implementation, and here is my take: basically open-source hardware wallets are the only way to go for secure key generation and signing. This hardware wallet should be able to interface with whatever service through a standardized protocol like you said. This minimizes the risk that the user is compromised, and the service makes sure that if the user is scammed through social engineering, or maybe even forced to give up his part of the key through force, the service can do rate-limiting etc.

Central banks are (semi)independent of the government (depending on the country) for the exact reason that governments (or more to the point, the political cycle) can't be trusted with monetary policy. 
In academia the consensus is that the independence of a central bank is positively correlated with both price stability and financial stability.

Yeah, no. Positivist economic research is a thing. Saying that there is not a robust record of a link between deflation and depression does not prove Austrian economists right, and subsequent research has reaffirmed the positive correlation between moderate inflation and growth, although I doubt you keep up with current economic research unless you are pointed to it by obscure Austrian economist blogs. 
If you come in here with Austrian economist theory and don't put some serious disclaimers, don't expect me to hedge my response with "this is what mainstream economists think", it's that simple. Copy pasting shit from your favorite Austrian economist blog takes three seconds, me writing a rebuttal would take hours, you can see why I'm not going to do that, right? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:51:16
You are wrong. While macroeconomics is so complex and full of variables that is practically impossible to model it perfectly, that does not mean this is applicable to the whole field of economics, or all of the social sciences. Such a proposition is absurd. For a simple example, if I conduct an experiment where I offer participants either 100$ or 0$ and they all take the 100$, I will have proven that people generally would rather get 100$ rather than nothing. 
Pointing to the scientific consensus is not a fallacy, as per own link. You can choose to believe in Austrian economics, but I don't see why you get to pass that stuff off as fact while I have to hedge my statements with "this is just the majority opinion of economists worldwide". If not willing to write a massive essay for the purpose of feeling like I won an internet argument is a "rationale of laziness", then I freely admit I am lazy. How about we conduct the reverse exercise, and I randomly troll Google Scholar for articles that are positive about moderate inflation, and you go line by line and debunk all of them? Surely you will be unable to deny this opportunity, otherwise you are utilizing the rationale of laziness yourself, am I correct?

There is no guarantee this money will actually be spent on alternatives though. Access to education is a boon to the whole community, but people without kids would not pay for that public good if all the other people without kids are not doing it either. 


You're dreaming if you think this would actually happen. The owner could just pocket the difference, not like the people that live there have any market power to demand differently. 


The fact that people have to demonstrate competence to be a doctor/lawyer/CPA does not mean people are discriminated against based on factors other than competence. Assuming the industries involved were capable of effective self-governance (that's a big if), they most likely would have to adopt some sort of certifications as well or people would not want to be operated on by some random guy claiming he is a doctor (although some might be forced to, because that's all they can afford, yay libertarianism!). But even with the things that the government allows some industries to self-regulate in today we see a lot of problems, and that's with the threat of government regulation hanging over their heads if they screw up, without any kind of oversight responsibility this would only worsen. 
Look at what's happened with Bitcoin exchanges where the industry is allowed to make its own rules, is that the kind of trial by fire you want for the health care industry?

You print out your paper wallet, which is empty, and then withdraw from Coinbase onto your public address which is on the paper wallet, now the paper wallet contains your Bitcoins. 
When you import your paper wallet back into a computer, you have to import the whole amount, you can't take "just" ten BTC out if you have hundred in your paper wallet, because otherwise you lose the 90BTC change. At least that's how I've come to understand it. 
The above is also a good reason to print multiple paper wallets, so you don't have to ever import the full amount, e.g. you could make 10 paper wallets with 1BTC each and just import one at a time as you need them so you never have 10BTC in a hot wallet.
Protip: try going through this process of withdrawing, making a paper wallet, and re-importing a paper wallet with tiny amounts of BTC so you are familiar with the process. This will make you feel more comfortable once you are working with bigger amounts.

Yes a lot of people have been "hacked", i.e. people gained access to their private keys, and if encrypted, to the password for those private keys. Multi-sig makes it so that there isn't a single point of failure, so a computer can be compromised but only one of the private keys is compromised so the funds are still safe. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:45:39
You're still vulnerable to having your password stolen by keyloggers etc., if you want to take security to a pro-level without too much fuss here is what you do:
1. Run Linux from an USB drive on a computer that is not connected to the Internet and is not connected to any storage media other than your Linux USB drive.
2. Install Electrum on Linux, create a wallet, you will get a twelve word seed, write this down on two pieces of paper, as well as one of the wallet addresses Electrum provides.
3. Send a small Bitcoin transaction from your hot wallet to the address you wrote down, if it arrives it means you didn't make any mistakes with your writing and you're good to go. (Optional: delete everything and reinstall Electrum and go through the recovery procedure with your seed so you know how it's done, then delete everything again)
4. Delete everything, send all your Bitcoins to the address, put one piece of paper in a bank lockbox, and keep one in a firesafe at home. Additionally, make an effort to remember your seed as an additional precaution so you will always have it available even if you manage to lose both pieces of paper. You can monitor your Electrum address through a blockchain explorer and you'll see all your Bitcoins arrived at that address.
EXTRA: Encrypt your twelve word seed with a password and only write the ciphertext on paper, now even if the paper gets stolen nobody can figure it out without the password. Or try a less high-tech method of obfuscating the fact that it's a seed by working it into a short story and making each word of the seed stand out in some way.

I don't think share prices going up is the same, "investing" in Bitcoin by running the mining software is different than going out and buying stocks, especially because back then it was basically risk-free. And the price increases have been crazier and more widely publicized than any technology stock.

Wouldn't the cost of capital rise a buttload because the risk-free rate of return would be much higher in a deflationary economy?

"If people want to voluntarily contribute to general education, fine"
And here's one of the fundamental problems of libertarianism: comes up short with answers to the free-rider problem. How is the outcome of abolition of public schools anything but "people who already have money pay to fund private schools for their own children only, everyone else gets left behind, the rich get richer the poor get poorer"? People might believe public education is a social good, but without a way to guarantee everyone pays for it there will always be people that would rather let others pay for those things. I've yet to hear a good solution to this besides handwaving "the invisible hand...uh... finds a way" nonsense. 
The "it's extortion and therefore morally wrong!!" argument is silly. You don't get to vote on what the "local gang" does or does not do or how much it takes. You might believe democracy has broken down wherever you live and you don't "really" get a say, but an idealized concept of democracy where you do means that it's fundamentally different from a protection racket, it's a consensus decision on how to fund, in an equitable manner, public goods that anyone can derive benefits from.
TL;DR: The actual outcome of these ideas is people with money get better services than those without, making upward mobility harder in the process, the idea that this will lead to a meritocracy is a joke and paradoxical. Any service that is needed for basic security that can not be operated without making profits will simply not be provided, the argument that charity or voluntary contributions will make it possible is at odds with human behavior in large heterogeneous communities.

I describe how a fiat exchange would work, it's not 100% secure but it removes all of the moral hazard. The only fail states are that the user does not sign after receiving fiat, but this would just be trolling since he can't get his funds back without the exchanges approval either, and with ID requirements would disincentivize people from doing that since they'd just get banned from the exchange and persecuted for no gain. The exchange could absorb the liability for this stuff if it does happen.
Another fail state is that the exchange loses their part of the private key, but this would require extreme incompetence and improper backups, and would only lose the funds you locked for trade. The fiat part of the equation should be protected by existing regulations.

So there was a flash crash to $102, but what does that really mean? One guy sold his bitcoins for sub-$600 prices, and a bunch of savvy people who were probably running algorithms (or had buy orders put at very low values for some reason) at that time bought those bitcoins from that guy. Nobody else was willing to sell those bitcoins that low, and a lot of people were willing to buy them for that low. So the value of the currency didn't change at all, just one guy really got screwed.

I said nobody knows how many coins were stolen. Including me. Maybe it was none and you are correct. But I don't think its beyond believability that they lost a good amount of BTC before they were able to detect their problems with transaction malleability, especially when they had an automatic system for 'giving back' people's BTC when the transaction actually did go through with a different hash, so it could've taken a long time before they saw something wasn't right. But it also could've taken one day. I don't know, but I'm not buying any Mt Gox BTC even though they're sold for less than 400 dollars, exactly because I don't know.

Another, slightly less hassle and more forgiving method is to use Electrum. 
The Electrum wallet basically allows you to make a bunch of wallet addresses all based on a single, 12-word seed. As long as you remember this 12-word seed or have it written down somewhere, you can restore all of the wallet anytime anywhere. You can also set-up a watching-only version of your wallet on an online computer, which means you can see when you've received bitcoins, generate new addresses, etc. but you won't be able to spend the bitcoins, and neither would a hacker. Instead of paper wallets, you'd just have your 12 word seed written down somewhere, no printing required! You can also spend your Bitcoins normally without the change problems of paper wallets. See here for instructions on how to do all this stuff:
Tin-foil hat pro-tip: Someone finding your 12 word seed in your home means he can steal your coins, so for additional paranoia you could encrypt the 12 word seed with some extra passphrase and write down the ciphertext on paper, but this is a little complicated and not needed if you can safely store your 12 word seed (fire-proof safe for example)

How are you not getting this? **I never took issue with Atkeson and Kahoe's findings, I took issue with Hulsmann's claims.** The quality of my argument or whether it is fallacious does not change the fact that I was not making ANY kind of comment on Atkeson and Kahoe's findings, YOU brought in that article FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, and then proceeded to paint me as an opponent of that article.

Yeah seriously, there are much simpler ways of stealing &lt;10$ shit than double-spending bitcoins. Instead of some high-tech heist, you put the candybar in your pocket and walk away. 99% success rate. Or dine and dash. If you're the kind of person to engage in petty theft, there are much more straightforward ways to do it.

This is wild speculation, but I think the kind of people that frequent probably heard about Bitcoin back in 2009, and are totally salty that they didn't get in back then. I remember back when it went to 10$ thinking "fuck I hope this Bitcoin thing doesn't pan out or I'm going to regret not running the mining software the day I heard about it". 
Now I still only have an insignificant amount of Bitcoins, but I am intrigued by the technology for it's own sake, not because of all the money I might make or might've made. Cryptography in general is just pretty cool. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:00:23
Alright, so if I send you ten articles randomly selected from Google Scholar that appear to be positive about a policy of moderate inflation, will you go line by line and address the *arguments themselves* one by one?
Economic modeling is a thing, and while it can not provide 100% certainty with regards to macroeconomics because there are simply too many variables, that does not mean they have no predictive power. Global warming research similarly relies on climate modeling because the climate is dependent on so many variables that it is not possible to have a perfect model of climate, yet would you seriously argue that global warming denialists are not cranks within their respective field?

Breaking the Austrian economics circlejerk I guess, and pointing to the scientific consensus of economists isn't really effective on the Bitcoin crowd, who largely regard economists as being in cahoots with the evil bankers.

Then don't, pretty simple solution. Or think of a better way to do fast transactions instead of whining about someone else's fix. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:48:07
You can do a 2-of-3 scheme and keep two for yourself, that way you can force transactions even if the service disappears. But when you do a trade on an exchange, when you sign the transaction to "lock" the funds for trade, it goes into a 2-of-2 wallet, so that you can't unilaterally get your funds out, which allows the exchange to act as an escrow (they do whatever verification they need that you got your part of the trade, and liberate your funds if they find that you didn't). This way you only risk your locked funds, but since hackers would only be able to deprive you of locked funds by not signing their part of the transaction, they still can't get the bitcoins without you signing your part of the transaction, so it's really not worth their while, and the exchange doesn't have an incentive to act maliciously either for the same reason. The only fail states are the exchange losing their part of the private key due to incompetence, or hackers expending a lot of effort just to troll you, and this still only risks the funds you locked for trade, not the funds in your 2-of-3 wallet.
Anyway, I know this sounds a bit complicated, but I believe that developers will find a way to make this stuff streamlined and provably secure eventually. The potential is there, all it needs is talented people making it easy to use for the average person. I believe that a combination of hardware wallets and an exchange as I described above will bring Bitcoin out of "beta" before the end of 2014. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:12:42
For sure, I'm already doing that (ciphertext seed on a piece of paper in a safe place, as well as memorized) with Electrum on an offline computer, but signing transactions is a pain in the ass and a point of failure (moving a USB-key between online and offline computers is a possible attack vector, however unlikely), hardware wallets neatly solve that problem, and hopefully Trezor incorporates plausible deniability to prevent rubber-hose cryptanalysis. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:33:06
The technology for reducing counter-party risk (2-of-3 escrow service), eliminating third party risk (multi-sig), forgiving and robust security measures (bip0032 and hardware wallets) and resisting rubberhose cryptanalysis (multi-sig and/or plausible deniability) are all there, it's just a matter of implementation now. BTC is a bit of a Wild West right now only suited for technology geeks, but I see it evolving into something regular people can use without having to wrap their heads around a bunch of complicated bullshit.
The government investigation stuff is only really a concern for merchants/exchanges not for end-users. The failure of Bitcoin is always a risk, that much is true, but people have been predicting it's death "anytime now" for years. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:32:23
I'm still waiting to hear why you constructed a strawman revolving around Atkeson and Kahoe's findings, when that was not what I took issue with at any point in this comment chain. 
I'm pointing you to the scientific consensus, which is that moderate inflation is a good thing, which directly contradicts your claim that inflation is a bad thing that leads to malinvestment and bubble/bust cycles. Why pointing to the scientific consensus is a fallacy in your mind despite your own link explicitly stating that pointing to the scientific consensus is not a fallacy is truly mind-boggling. If there is one thing in this world that is incomprehensible, is just what is going on in your head when you write these things.

All the adoption, technology improvements and general infrastructure investments might make Bitcoin a successful currency, but that could be at a lower, more stable value than it is now, really who knows what part of the current value is rampant speculation and overvaluation.
