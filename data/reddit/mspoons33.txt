But purchasing an asset/bitcoin is not a taxable event. crypto is only taxable when you trade it or sell it. why would the IRS come after you for purchasing something?

Bitcoin will be the go to under the table payment system in a short time.  The amount people that work under the table is ridiculously high.

The giant fart I ripped on Sussie during 4th grade recess is still up in the air. Unless of course it condensed in the sky and rained on her on the way home. Wonder if she thought of me then--she was cute!

Hopefully he'll invest too much and just waist his days staring at charts instead of ruining other people's lives.

Always best to put in as little upfront capital in a depreciating asset if your alternative is an investment that will increase in value in the next 2 years.

Thats fair. My three best gains came from 1. cost averaging massive Ether dip in July 2017 and hodling. 2. Altseason speculation Dec/Jan (obviously) 3. shorting BTC on Bitmex last month. To your point, each one needs consistency/discipline. The first one is the easiest to master, the second one.. emm maybe just needs a lot of luck.. third won is the hardest to master, needs consistency/discipline, and some luck. 
hmmmm looking at it now, think i might be doing it wrong lol
