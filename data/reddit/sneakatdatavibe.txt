Just because something isn't a guarantee doesn't mean it isn't practical or commonplace or even reasonably accurate.

...that doesn't require publishing globally my frequency of laundry soap purchases.  Or pulling out my smartphone, unlocking it, opening an app, scanning a code, and confirming the amount.

Thank his make-believe god that the scotus saw that that's idiotic behavior and that the 14th amendment means that letting states deprive people of equal protection under the law is a violation of their basic human dignity.
Shame your boss doesn't care about that stuff.
Even those among us who would love to see a smaller government and the government out of the marriage business (not gonna happen anytime soon, b t dubs) will be (and have been) alienated by a "lol states rights!!! (including deprivation of individual human rights) woo!" position.
When an Irish Catholic appointed by Reagan can see through to giving gay people equal marriage rights in all 50 states, perhaps shouting "states rights" as loud as you can is not the correct approach.  It just (rightfully) makes you look like an extremist fucktard.
Tell me again how his personal views don't factor in to it.

Because you'd not be giving up "right to trial by jury", you'd be giving up "right to trial by jury in a civil proceeding with ChangeTip" which is not something you will *ever* use so it practically affects you in no way whatsoever.

100000000000000 MB blocks means:
* waiting 25 minutes after your bill has come after dinner before you can leave the restaurant
* not being able to get a refund after a merchant shipped you defective goods
Bitcoin's not a good fit for retail use. Never has been, never will be.  These sort of contrived "million of end users using bitcoin" scenarios simply won't ever exist, even if bitcoin's adoption goes to the maximum possible.

There is no evidence whatsoever that anyone knows or controls the corresponding private keys to the rewards in the first ~20k blocks.  They could have been generated randomly, or deleted.
At the time they were generated, they were worthless, and remained effectively worthless for quite some time after the fact.  It is complete and total speculation that the person or persons known as Satoshi has or has ever had access to those keys.

Oh, for a civil suit?  Any sort of trial is not a real risk if you trade in ChangeTip-style amounts.  Nobody's getting sued over &lt;$1k.
Such is just posturing.

a reminder: we are talking about under $5 in bitcoin in changetip. there is no judge because there is no trial because IT'S FIVE BUCKS.

Perhaps I should have written "intentionally deleted" to make it clear.
Satoshi was obviously interested in being fair, as the genesis block quote is not just a political statement but an express indication of a lack of pre-mining.  Perhaps not availing themselves of the huge financial benefits of being the only first-mover possible, as well as unburdening themselves of the huge political/security risks involved in having so much of a currency you wish to actually be adopted was part of their intent.

No, he doesn't think "people should be able to do what they want".  He thinks people should only be able to do what they want if they live in a state that also thinks they should do what they want.
Let's stop pretending that personal beliefs don't factor in to this.  The only reasonable position is that all humans with a pulse should have equal protection under the law.  Shoving his anti-equality beliefs off onto the states means he's personally *and professionally* totally fine with ass-backward states fucking over the millions of gay people that live within them.
Thank fuck scotus threw that idiot nonsense out.  "Leaving it to the states" is the same as "not for equal rights".  Don't get it twisted.

The fact that the blocks were mined by satoshi is also an assumption.
At the time, they were worth nothing - not billions.  Not even thousands.

I know that, and that's why I shut down the business before I launched it.  It sucks, because the where, who, how, and whom of money transfers is no business of the federal government (despite what the laws say), but they've got the guns, so we must live without our basic freedoms.
I already host and live outside of the USA, so it's basically just a matter of time before I renounce my citizenship to be able to continue working on things like this.

Why on Earth would anyone continue to use that service after they fell victim to such noob security issues such as XSS and poor hashing? Even their new hashing scheme is still insecure. 
It's only a matter of time before they get hacked again.

They are not easily verifiable without destroying the bill and transferring the keys off of the private key theoretically contained therein.  And that requires internet access at the point of sale to perform.
If there's internet access at the point of sale, you could just have the purchaser send you a normal bitcoin payment using a miniature computer disguised as a mobile telephone.  Then you won't have to trust anyone.
