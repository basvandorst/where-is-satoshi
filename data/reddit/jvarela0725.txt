Yes because banks take money with no questions asked.

I've read a few things about this mostly, the Bittrex and Tether connection and how they're pumping Bitcoin and driving the price up which will setup the ultimate fall. The saying goes "If something is too good to be true, it probably is".

What else did they steal? Just the computers? If so then they knew what they were looking for. Most likely a close friend.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:24:09
Fine, I'll be the first to say it... TO THE MOON!
P.S We have memes too.

These Banksters fund wars for crying out loud! The creator of Bitcoin is yet to reveal himself. This could be the beta project, let us some of us get rich and create the fall. Then add their own Block Chain currency and all money will be on a computer screen. You'll never be able to buy a pack a beer without that information being sold to your insurance.

Oh lord the pictures I'd send to that email address.

I am, because I'm not pouring more than 7% of my net wealth but my brother has a buddy who took out a loans and is about 15k. I'm sure he might pay that off soon but some might be lucky enough to have gotten a piece of the pie before the wheels fall off.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:22
The whales might be setting us up for the big fall. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:45:49
Hey man, your name is a great song.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:33:15
All these statist in here lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:45
They will never relinquish their control smh 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:11:31
Yep, knowing these scum bags it will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:28:13
So moving it from CB to a offline drive is best? Store it in a software? I'm not sure what is the best way to keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:20
I can't buy LTC right now on Coinbase. It says it's disabled, fuck them!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:32:01
We hope John McAfee doesn't need to eat his dick.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:39
Yeah why is that? Is the coin even stored there? Where is said coin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:16
CC and DC are instant while bank takes a few days. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:52:54
I wanted to as well but I was too busy buying BTC at the dip! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:45
Sucks mate, I bought in at 9,100 again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:11
I'm in the same boat... 8k might be too good to pass up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:55
I for one am moving my stuff out of CB.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:12
Went back up to 9300 and I bought again LOL. YOLO. I live at my brothers for the next few months rent free so.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:19:12
Sorry to hear it, been using CoinBase for a few days and soon as all my stuff clears I'm down with it and moving my shit elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:42:12
LMAO 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:08
Interesting... maybe I'll buy more coin to hodl. If we continue to get acceptance like this maybe we do hit 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:12:18
Must be nice.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:22
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:28:53
But why did you do that? Makes no sense lol. Why would you sell if you just bought $300? Only invest with what your okay losing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:32:46
CC have a 100 dollar limit I believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:21:46
Only LTC atm, BTC and ETH work just fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:40:31
Don't feel bad I bought it for 10,700 before it dipped down to 8,800 and I lost my shit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:30:46
I'll take look at the video on my lunch break!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:56
How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:01
If you put $1000 in and it reaches 100,000 then 10,000 ain't bad... easiest 10k you'll earn. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:24
Me too! I went to take a piss and nearly pissed myself! :|
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:30:37
I'm on the fence with buying a little or just buying Dash. It's last 30 days it's gone up 163.98%
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:30:01
I'll have to check again, maybe I missed it. I did use a CC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:38
It's allowing BTC but still have LTC disabled as it dips. Frustrating that I cannot buy during the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:19
People selling their alt coins such as LTC,ETH to move it to BTC as it dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:10
I bought from CB before and during the dip with zero issues.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:59
You had me at memes...
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:25:04
Sound advice.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:13
This.
