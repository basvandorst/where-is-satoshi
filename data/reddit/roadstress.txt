You and the other 56 that up-voted you have a limited view over Bitcoin. People will not have to really understand the sidechains if proper tools are developed. They only need to understand the concept and the benefits or the risks that a model imposes. Think of the normal Bitcoin wallets. I don't need to understand why I don't actually send coins to an address, but it's easier for me as a regular user to work with them!
People are accustomed with the "checking" and "savings" terms and even if they aren't they will be able to understand the differences in having 2 types of account when using the Bitcoin network. Having sidechains brings more options to the Bitcoin network that people can use to meet their needs. Your view simply limits these option just because you can't seem to find other use case scenarios to the Bitcoin network.

What did you expect from the politicians when "buying illegal drugs anonymously" came up? Someone simply had to do it. This has nothing to do with the Foundation itself.
What did the Foundation do regarding this issue and how much did they spent on that and what was the result? Was that the correct approach(if any) from your point of view?
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:46:36
This sounds viable considering that the Core maintainers are pushing important stuff without any consensus (like RBF) while everyone is busy with this endless debate. I wonder how many features can they push until this will be over.

Thank you for your reply and thank you for the try, but let me share you my view about your points:
1) I find the press outreach really unnecessary to have this as a target without nothing else in the early years of an ecosystem. Press doesn't bring developers or funding for the ecosystem;
2) Gavin didn't need funding. The Foundation only helped him to justify an income. I think it is the same for the rest of the key core developers This is clearly a non-argument from my point of view;
3) The Foundation founded bitnodes in a time when that was really unnecessary. There was no danger then, not more than today when there are a lot less nodes online;
4) Unless the Foundation planned to write another programming language for webpages then I don't see how the Bitcoin.org website could've impacted the Foundation budget.

Unfortunately he was smarter than everyone and especially than bitcoin companies that bothered to reply to his first draft were outplayed by him. Those companies were purposing that additional regulation isn't needed because of the existing money transmission laws and in reply he is making it so that this argument doesn't stands in court because that is what the companies were going to use if needed. Fools!
Next time please ignore the shmuck face regulators.

Your biggest example is the biggest mining manufacturer double spending against a Dice website? This is the centralization that you should fear, not the low nodes count. Remember that even now, after 6 years and tons of VC money poured, bitcoin is still mostly embraced by hobbyists and most of the big members are well known and they will co-operate right away in case something goes wrong really bad. Let's see Bitfury trying to double spend against some reputable members. I wonder what will happen then. A dice website mean nothing in this ecosystem. Show us the real damage, not some school brawl!
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:13:15


What fails to see in the big picture is that once the transactions backlog will grow that big that it will take several days for a min-fee transaction to be confirmed the chaos will begin. All wallets that are existent right now can't deal with a fee war properly and this means that only the real experts will know how to fix their unconfirmed transaction. I am sure that most of the bitcoin users who are capable enough to understand the underlaying technology will have problems fixing their unconfirmed transactions! I don't see any solution for this from the non-8MB group.
Personally I see this as a big issue and Gavin's proposal of raising the cap to 8MB seems the most KISS solution that creates least chaotic results.

I agree and support this. If the change from 32MB to 1MB was made without any discussion and with a specific purpose only then we shouldn't discuss it now to raise it to a lower than before value.
Why not lower it to 2MB instead of 1MB? It's totally ok for anyone with low bandwidth. Why not 3MB? There was no consensus for the 1MB limit. Not wanting to raise it just to protect the Chinese miners is a non-existing argument.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:36:14
Well the Core maintainers are going to bend down and buy some lube! Apparently they are the puppies that obey their wish to not raise the blocksize limit to protect their orphan rate.

People need to learn that services cost money. There is nothing wrong in offering services that are friendly for everyone for a small fee. Not everyone knows/wants to have his old cold storage and the average user can't get this kind of insurance. Bitcoin may be free, but the services around it can't be free. I also think that this is making people more aware of everything that goes around them. It makes them more aware of the fees that are not hidden. Banks have tons of hidden fees in comparison.

I am sure that the idiots claiming that Roger is greedy about the ~500k for leasing the bitcoin.com domain will not spend 1 second to think that he really doesn't need those money because it's just spare change for him
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:20:05
Why should he do that? Since when are top level domain names a public service? He can do whatever he wants with the domain.
Also, I am sure that whoever wants to learn about bitcoin will not directly type bitcoin.com into their browsers. We are not in the '90s anymore. People are typing "facebook" into google now-a-days to get to facebook.
P.S. only -6 points in 21 hours. I am sure that the idiots have no idea that Roger has 300k bitcoin. I stand on my opinion that 500k is just poket cash for him and that the asked fee per month provides him with an insurance that the buyer means serious business, not like scummy Chinese business guys.

Advocating for illiteracy is simply stupid. Bitcoin is not a human right that should be provided for free. Not on someone else expenses (full nodes and hashrate). I had ZERO problems during that period because I knew how to properly use the fees and I wasn't a cheap bastard who wouldn't be bothered to pay 3-4 cents extra in order to get his tx confirmed in 1-2 blocks.
Please leave the bitcoin ecosystem and go and use the altcoins and the banks or learn how to properly use the bitcoin network. Thank you!

Back in the XT days I was defending Gavin with the same argument that the actual average block size would increase marginally, but that's not the only bad thing that can happen. You are forgetting about UXTO which can grow really really fast with an 8MB block.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:04:48


You have a strange point of viewing things. The tools exist today and will be much better in the future. When bitcoin will "succeed" then the wallets will be much more complex and users will be much more educated than today. Complaining about an issue when there are tools available to mitigate that issue is called "useless whining". It's like complaining that it is raining when you leave from work when you don't bother to check the weather and when there are no clouds when you leave for work. It is your fault for not checking everything, it's not God's fault!
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:07:21
What if we will be in the same spot in a couple of months due to various reasons with a 2MB too? Raising the block size isn't a fix-it-all solution and that comes with a higher cost to the network maintainers. Why isn't anyone taking that into consideration?
@_date: 2016-03-14 22:45:53


I use a wallet that suggests me a good fee and I knew about the tx flood. Even if you aren't in this category you can check  before sending a transaction just to be sure.

You mean that they are not paying 3-4 cents, they are paying 10-12 cents per transaction? Long live their contribution while they have 0 technical skill regarding bitcoin code and they provide an unknown to me number of nodes, but pretty sure it's not relevant for their size considering that we have regular users that run a couple of full nodes at their own cost.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:56:39
You, like the others, still don't get it. Users need to learn how bitcoin works otherwise they lose. Let's compare it with another situation. Let's say users don't know how change works and when they make their first transaction all their coins go away. Or let's say that users don't know how wallet back-up works and they proceed to reinstall windows while having their coins on the Core client (this actually happened during 2009-2011 to some users). PANIC time!
Why should we ignore the education part and simply raise the blocksize limit in order to allow *everyone*  to use the bitcoin network? We are not allowing people to drive unless they go to a small education course, otherwise they will crash the car from their first week. It's the same with bitcoin. People need to learn how to use it and then they can complain. Otherwise it's simply retarded to complain about something that you don't know how to use it. Bitcoin is not a human right!

I don't care about your gains. It's simple. Coinbase wants to encumber the network maintainers for their own good. It's that easy! They aren't contributing with many resources, but they want to benefit at the expense of others. That's not ok.

Trial and error education? I don't get it. I thought evolution is based in trial and error, but I don't see how can education about something so rigid like the bitcoin rules can be "trial and error". There is no capacity ceiling (the ceiling only comes when fees are a considerable amount compared to the transaction). Myself and many others didn't experienced the last days "capacity ceiling" as you call it because we simply raised our fees with a very small amount in order to get our tx included in blocks. Why are you so reluctant to learning about fees? Is that such a really hard to understand thing? Are you too damn lazy? Or what?

All I see is users who are learning about how bitcoin fees work. I must admit that I was barely interested how fees work and now seems a good time to learn about them.
Next step will be to have some kind of software options that will allow us to manage fees much better that at this moment. Then nobody will complain that their transaction is stuck because they will be able to select for themselves the amount that they want to pay or the urgency of their transaction.

@_date: 2016-03-04 21:52:46
Please spread it to everyone to see the real shenanigans behind Classic as a form of governance.
1) A drop of 50% in hashrate is simply FUD;
2) Picking the "good enough" solution over the "perfect one" is a wrong and rushed decision;
3) Openly admitting that Classic will be run by capitalist companies makes me love the Core even more;
4) The whole salesman tactic of inducing a fear then presenting a solution for it smells really bad;
5) Openly admitting that he will try to persuade the most corrupt business man on the planet, the Chinese again a very bad move;
6) The lack of developers and openly admitting that the Classic is not good enough to take over, but rushing the change simply dazzles me;
7) Burdening the network maintainers/volunteers with 2MB blocks without any optimization(remember that SegWit and other cool stuff from Core will be available in Classic only when Core will have them ready) while he and his company are not dedicating any resources to support the network is simply a wrong thing to do.
I'm sticking with Core's governance all day everyday over this bullshit!
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:31:28
I am not the person to define cutoff for being a cheap bastard. If you are using the bitcoin network then it means that you have some kind of tech device. If you can afford the tech device then you can surely afford 3-4 extra cents. Maybe even 5 cents. If you want to argue about this extra cost then feel free to do it by yourself. I can fill my time with something else more productive instead of whining about non-existent stuff.
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:05:18
I was an XT supported myself, but now I am Core all the way because people simply can't see further than **their** problem. The Classic supporters keep repeating that there is a blocksize issue right now and that we must raise the 1MB limit **right now**.
We had a small congestion for a couple of days and everyone was acting like the sky was falling, like it was a human right to have access to the bitcoin network. They didn't bother to question what is going on, they simply demanded access! Nothing else. They don't want to hear about fees, about network costs, about how a secure and decentralize network works and I can understand that! That is not for everyone, not even for Coinbase who is planning to make a long term profit out of this. But pushing against having access to the network no matter what is simply stupid imo. When the lights go out people don't get their forks and riot the electric company, when the internet stops they don't storm their ISP. Why is this happening to bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:23:04

Blockstream isn't milking the bitcoin network right now like Coinbase does. First difference.
Second difference: Blockstream people have contributed with much more code/testing/new features to bitcoin that Coinbase will ever do in their short business life. Blockstream wants to build while Coinbase wants to make profit. Blockstream isn't gaining anything right now from a 1MB or 2MB block size while Coinbase badly needs 2MB blocks+imposed bitcoin governance with ZERO technical skills! They have admitted it!

What works for you may not work for everyone. This is what everyone should realize about "reaching consensus". Understanding the issues of others and try to work something for them too instead of simply taking them out of the equation.
If the cost of 2MB is trivial for you then it may not be for everyone else. The hashing power from China has issue with latency and it's useless to have 2MB blocks if they are mining 0 transaction blocks or 1MB blocks in order to avoid orphans. Have you taken into consideration HDD failures, bandwidth costs that isn't available the same for everyone and the fact that this is a real extra cost for the node maintainers and for miners who are usually running on very thin margins. Why would you trade hashing power in order to have a larger block size? I find this a bit disturbing because if we extrapolate and we exaggerate stuff like Brian Armstrong likes to do then you are fine with a 20MB block size, but with a considerable loss in hashing power. This is not consensus. It's simply your own good at the cost of the others.

You do realize that this kind of attack was possible all the time and at a much cheaper rate when BTC was trading for less than $250. We had some "stress tests" in the past and I don't remember so many people complaining. This time seems that the wave was much bigger which means for me that more and more people are using bitcoin and they are getting into issues. I see this as a good thing.

So you would trade ~50% of the hashing power for the 8MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:48:34
Oh that was a bad move from the mods because I see it as a suicide note for Classic. Please spread it to everyone to see the real shenanigans behind Classic as a form of governance.
1) A drop of 50% in hashrate is simply FUD;
2) Picking the "good enough" solution over the "perfect one" is a wrong and rushed decision;
3) Openly admitting that Classic will be run by capitalist companies makes me love the Core even more;
4) The whole salesman tactic of inducing a fear then presenting a solution for it smells really bad;
5) Openly admitting that he will try to persuade the most corrupt business man on the planet, the Chinese again a very bad move;
6) The lack of developers and openly admitting that the Classic is not good enough to take over, but rushing the change simply dazzles me;
7) Burdening the network maintainers/volunteers with 2MB blocks without any optimization(remember that SegWit and other cool stuff from Core will be available in Classic only when Core will have them ready) while he and his company are not dedicating any resources to support the network is simply a wrong thing to do.
I'm sticking with Core's governance all day everyday over this bullshit!
@_date: 2016-03-06 06:25:18
What is your upper limit of raising your resources dedicated to your full node and for how long are you able to sustain this cost? Would 2x be acceptable? What about 8x? How long would you be able to keep those costs running considering that you gain exactly zero benefit from it (except the fact that you can trade freely in a decentralized network) ?
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:57:29

In a decentralized network with billions at stake there is no room for failure. Would you start building something on a foundation that expects failure? I don't think so.
@_date: 2016-03-02 21:40:10


That's true only if you are assuming that the party that is flooding the network right now will be mentally retarded to just stop if we increase the block size. If they want to flood the network they can do it even if we increase the block size while education about how fees work in order to avoid this flood can do much more and much better. Just think for a bit!
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:19:46
Option 2. I think that the ecosystem can manage and mitigate a miner attack and will allow it to learn a lot from it so it can be better prepared when another attack will come. Bring it on!
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:30:41
It's simple math. They are making more money by dumping a block with "dust" fees in order to raise the average network fees. They can also fill their blocks with big sized transaction in order to make to raise the average network fees.
@_date: 2016-03-06 06:28:42
You missed my point. I was talking about the main bitcoin network meaning full decentralized nodes and hashing power. Their legal status in US has nothing to do with the bitcoin network availability. Raising the block size to 2MB would occur some direct costs to the ones that are having full nodes and the miners. Coinbase wants to maximize their profit using the bitcoin network while others are paying in order to keep the network up and running. Great business plan!

@_date: 2016-03-08 17:57:51


Bitcoin isn't only those people. What if the "other" people want a 100kb block size? Who should we listen? How do we differentiate about good and bad choices? What if the people that want a small increase now will want one more in 1 month and so on?
And yes it is a "no matter what" request because when asked to learn about how fees work they simply refuse! They only want a blocksize increase, nothing else!


Guess you are missing Coinbase efforts to change the "provider" of the bitcoin network rules and consensus. They want to change the Core team to their own team. This IS pitchforks and storming the current environment. Think more and be less subjective maybe!
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:55:15
You are right and most of the people can't see or don't want to accept this point of view.
As for why would people invest well it's because they can do it legally with contracts and legal documents which otherwise they couldn't and also it save them ALL the hassle of having to securely store and transact at any time the coins.
@_date: 2016-03-14 22:49:04


You clearly don't understand the benefits of SegWit which are much bigger than increasing the tx/s cap.


Of course. My favorite part is: "Simplified version of Segregated Witness from Core, when it is available." :)

Try to contact the miners or the mining pools. Centralized mining helps you in this case.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:31:29
Fees are as low as possible right now from my point of view. You need to remember that the bitcoin network isn't paying from thin air. The full nodes maintainers and the miners need incentives too. It's not about your tx cost, it's also about network security and maintenance!
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:47:05

Maybe it's time for the exchangers, payment processors and other service providers to work with the big miners/mining pools into backing up their option regarding the block size. It is fair towards their customers to let them know their decision in case of a hard fork so their customers can decide if they leave or not. This is how we should reach consensus.
Just a shower-thought.

@_date: 2015-07-24 08:38:24
I don't like it either, but this has a very easy solution. If we, the users, are having issues with the block space, then we can make the security tokens (bitcoins) as scarce as the block space. We just need to acquire and hold to as many coins as possible to artificially lower the maximum number of coins available.

Usually life beats the movies. I do believe that this is a real scenario. There can't be no other way in the long term. Are you telling me that in case of a 75% hard fork BitPay will rely their business on the hands of a couple of big miners/pools without any upfront discussion? I find this to be a very easy kill switch for many bitcoin service providers.
I'm listening to your version.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:03:55
I wouldn't call them trolls. Just people with a different agenda. Their own agenda!
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:19:42
Even if the bitcoin doesn't go up in value the miners will find ways to secure additional income besides mining. They can have a deal with the merchants and the exchanges and other bitcoin service providers to secure/pledge hashrate towards various stuff (for example for securing one chain in case of a higher block hard fork) and to secure the way of them doing business.
Nobody is talking about this, but I see this as the inevitable. Bitpay or Coinbase can't afford to have their business ruined by the Chinese with their slow internet so they must find a way to insure their business and this means to pay for their orphaned blocks and more! Let's do this!

I don't agree. I know people with libraries of movies on CDs or HDD hoarders who were storing random bullshit data without any incentive. We are in Bitcoinland here which is still a geek-ish land. There will always be people willing to invest a lot of money for storing data without any return. Now it's easier and cheaper to store insane amounts of data than 5 years ago and it will continue on this path.
Considering that there are lots of people and companies with direct interests in Bitcoin I am sure that there will always be someone to store that data privately and with some kind of checkpoints if really needed. An Amazon sybil attack would be futile and damaging to the company. I think that the chances of this happening and the actual damages are very small. This is a consensus network. I see a high potential of consensus between all directly affected parties in case of a sybil attack right now. And  that is increasing as we speak, just like the hashrate last year :)
I am against rejecting and pro building and innovating so let's not talk about what not to do because something bad might happen when we can build something that we can independently trust. Of course there are some cases where we can't build and innovate, but this is not the case. I feel that with the proper tools we can make the sybil attack pointless.

This shows the understanding of the miners about how the whole system works. And this is a happy case. I expect much worse from the other big miners.
When a big miner like BitFury states that an 8MB block will require "Elevated hardware requirements" for me this is worse than the centralization that everyone is complaining.
Everyone rushed to brag about their affiliation to one BIP or another, but nobody has stated their reasons for their choice. I wonder why.

For 100M$+ they could design something like a consumer level device for wide-spread public services like notaries to be able to secure documents or hashes of documents in the blockchain. They could have a special software that makes it easy for an digital document to be scanned and hashed so that the notary could sign the transaction confirming the authenticity. There would be worldwide accepted white lists and black lists for authorized signatures. It can be 3-out-of-3 signatures where the secretary prepares the document and signs it, the notary signs it and one additional signature for security. By buying this device and paying for the power bill monthly they could insure the security of the network (imagine all the notaries worldwide keeping at least one small-medium sized mining device running) and they could have the right to use the ledger and all its benefits.
I am sure that there could be many other similar uses. For example imagine having ALL cars service history book in a public ledger available worldwide with minimal costs (monthly power bill paid by the car dealers that want to use the ledger).
If something like this happens I see all industrial miners going bankrupt since the mining will be clearly not profitable since everyone that is paying the mining power bill will not care how much the devices will mine. It will be a subscription just like many other services.
I haven't figured out what will happen with the mined coins.
Is this something viable? If not then let's extrapolate a bit.
