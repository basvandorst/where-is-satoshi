What is a primecoin?

In my above comment [here]( I mention how strong my graphics card. 
Why is gpu and cpu mining useless... I just don't understand. Anyway, so I can buy one of these things to easily mine bitcoins instead of using my computer. Just stick it in and forget it? Interesting... so it costs me .5 bitcoins to buy it... when I have none. How is that suppose to work out?
Also, what about using an MSI afterburner. It tells me how much of the cpu's recourses is used for mining. Maybe I could increase the amount of cpu power that's put into mining these things.

I don't know what GPU or cryptocurrency is. I'll look into it though. Right now, I've put a few hours of research into this Bitcoin thing, and I have nothing to show for it. I wanna make sure I'm not wasting my time on some sort of huge scam.

I wasn't able to find my GPU there, just too many complicated list.
But, I entered all my into dustcoin.com and found out that my earnings is -0.02 bucks an hour. But its $7.82 if I use Litecoin... what's that. It seems more profitable... but Ive never herd of it, and its clearly not popular.

Thanks a lot everyone. I understand that bitcoin mining will be very difficult with a PC.

My graphics card is [AMD Radeon HD 6770]( 1.36 TFLOPs computing power.
Is the intensive process worth the low amount of money?

I apologize. I meant I want to get bitcoins and sell them to make a profit.
