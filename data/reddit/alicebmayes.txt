Anti-feminist but not anti-female is bullshit. Of course people will be anti-feminist but not anti-women, people who would make fun of rape and treat women as objects.

If every time someone did something women-hating we got bogged down in evasive discussions of "intent" we would never get anywhere. That's just excuses to avoid confronting abusive behavior that drives women away from Bitcoin.

That the community is making excuses for Peter's behavior rather than condeming it makes me feel unsafe.

Read the rest of this post. You're one of many people making excuses for him.

A lot of differences? That's the kind of excuse people make to avoid confronting behavior that drives people away from this community. It's well known that Peter's behavior on the mailing lists, IRC, reddit, etc. has been abrasive and nasty. It's disgusting that it's also specifically anti-women.

Wow, just... wow.

"Rape against petertodd"! What a great example of the way we dismiss victims by treating rape as insignificant.

Don't you see how making fun of that notion is implicitly making fun of victims and telling them their claims won't be taken seriously?
Making fun of the meme is saying we don't take womens issues seriously.

You a women or a man?
What would you know about what's threatening to women? Making jokes about these issues inherently says this community doesn't take them seriously.

He's making fun of rape accusations. Dismissing them as accusations of "pre-rape" is a common anti-victim strategy by abusers and dismisses campaigns to educate males about consent issues.
The story portrays barbie as a blackhat working for a shady government agency who doesn't have a sense of ethics.

So why is Peter Todd publicly associating with people who advocate anti-women hatred?
