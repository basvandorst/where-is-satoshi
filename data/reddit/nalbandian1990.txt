So would I be correct to say that if we get a fast majority of miners running segwit2x software it seems we are not really headed for a hard fork/Bitcoin split?
I've done some research but still lots to understand/catch up on

So the enforcing for BIP 91 is not automatically done by over 80% signalling BIP 91? Cause it's a soft fork with a small update, so basically all the miners now have to upgrade to BIP 91 cause of the over 80% signalling right? But you're worried that even though signal BIP 91 there are not updating their software to BIP 91?
Last question, what do miners have again the soft fork/update of BIP 91, seems almost harmless to them no?

My question is who needs do to this enforcing and how? (51% of) The miners, by rejecting non Segwit blocks? (51% of) The users by signalling BIP 91 at every transaction? 
I've done quite a bit of research last days to get up to speed but this part is still a bit unclear to me

I've done my fair bit of research the last days to get up to speed with everything but some things are still a bit unclear to me.
Could you explain the difference between the signalling between miners and users? Cause if 80%+ of the miners are signalling doesn't BIP 91 rules get enforced automatically?
So by users have to signal do they mean Coinbase, Bitstamp all the platforms that offer/do trade with Bitcoin should "check a certain box"/signal BIP 91 with every transaction or actual individual users?
And how is gonna/should enforce BIP 91 is that combination of users and miners? And could you explain how this works please?

Cause the BIP148 "way" is the opposing side of Segwit2x correct? But is it the case than if 80%+ doesn't go for Segwit that they automatically go for BIP148?
I also just read an article that stated that 95% of the miners must signal their vote for Segwit(2x) in order to activate it? Is that true, that seems like an major amount. 
And now we just see some major platforms going for Segwit2x instead of BIP148? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:38:29
But besides the support for Segwit2x there is also the software quality issue right? I've read a lot of people say Segwit2x has been developed by only a few and not peer reviewed is there any truth to this and if so why are all the platform signaling their support for a potentially inadequate software "update"/Segwit2x?
That's the last piece of the puzzle for me cause all this support for Segwit2x can still cause a lot of FUD around Bitcoin if the code turns out to be faulty/inadequate (which some people/articles are suggesting)? 
And also very important when we will find this out, along the dates of the coming "deadlines" till the 1st of August or would it be after that?
And again so much appreciation for all the explaining and I've seen you even got gold for it! Congrats!

Thanks a lot! I think you cleared up a hope things for myself/everyone wanting to know more.
But one last question if that's oké :)? So what happens if Segwit2x​/BIP91 doesn't reach the 80+% adoption but neither does BIP48/UASF gain enough support. What will happen? Will that cause a Bitcoin split? Or will the system just continue as it was now?
Or what will there only be a Bitcoin split if BIP48/UASF gain much more support (50%?) and Segwit2x not coming to the 80+%?
Thanks again Rannasha, you have my upvotes!

Could you tell me the difference between Segwit2x and BIP91. As far as I read they are the same (not to technically speaking) correct?

So with the activation of Segwit some form of a fork will happen (hard/soft/something) to increase the blocksize which would result in a different chain/split of Bitcoin? 
And the 90 days later increase is a given/certainty (if Segwit) is invoked? Which could cause an other chain/(hard) fork/split of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:28:12
What does this mean exactly (ELI5)? They following a different approach?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:01:15
But if the vast majority of the miners implements Segwit2x and there for will activate Segwit some form of a fork will happen (hard/soft/something) to increase the blocksize which would result in a different chain/split of Bitcoin right? Cause the increase in blocksize can only happen with a (hard/soft) fork and will/could cause a Bitcoin split?
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:32:04
How big is BitFury and is this them dropping support for Segwit2x/BIP91 or could you think of an other reason why they are not signalling BIP91?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:39:54


Are many of the core developers quiting? Is that cause of Segwit2x big adoption or the hand in hand coming Segwit activation? Or an other reason I haven't listed here?
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:59:10
Why would BIP91/Segwit2x cause a collapse?
