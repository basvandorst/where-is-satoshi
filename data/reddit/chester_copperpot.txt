Whatever you do, sell the holy shit out of all your precious, sexy, boner like BTC before.....drum roll please, December 18th, when futures (another cute name for market manipulation for the ultra rich) begin betting on their own manipulated BTC and yes, know one here can say, "it cant be manipulated". Oh, Nancy - you bet your sweat ass it can and it already is, hence the run (big run, too huh) as of late. Look at most of you in this thread...lmao, everyone is sold on it's $1M coin OMG sell all u have and buy it! If wall street never got in I'd agree, but all of you NEED to understand, that was a very bad thing, very very bad. Here's my advice = it'll pop a but from true buy order coming in on underlying coin the 18th - 21st maybe and then when paper Big Dick money shorts come in that $340B MC @ 55% BTC will get absolutely murdered, just murdered. Anyway, good luck and if were u id sell now, buy XLM, UBIQ, STEEM $ and a few other actual game changing techs and you WILL make more doing that than you ever would in BTC. Just a note: I loved what we had going and BTC will have its running days and pop here and there, but I'm sorry, she's manipulated now, plane and simple and you folks need to be able to study up on future put/call contract options trading before commenting. If you guys think it's been a roller coaster ride these last few months, OMG, just wait til margin/futures trading comes starts jumping off. On the flip side, learn how to trade these and you could get overnight stupid rich...just stupid rich. Anyway, cheers mafagas.
