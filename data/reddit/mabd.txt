Not necessarily. Once a supermajority is reached at 75%, the other 25% can swiftly move over once they see the direction the chain is moving in. It is like any fork. There is also plenty of time after the supermajority is reached to switch over, since it is not implemented immediately.

How is this relevant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:31:06
It may be a general economic rule, but it doesn't apply when cost of production is arbitrary, and the generation of new supply is fixed (25 bitcoin per 10 minutes). I'll say it again: the cost of production is arbitrary.  This rule that you learned in Econ 101 does not apply here.
You're right MV = MC is not an opinion, but in this case, the cost is adjustable as the mining market is more competitive. If there are huge profits in mining, more miners will get in increasing cost (as more miners compete for a fixed amount of resources) until MV = MC. The reason this is different than the usual cases is that in most cases the cost of production is not arbitrary but based on certain fixed costs. Here instead the amount of production is fixed by design (based on adjusting difficulty). This is an unusual situation.

No doubt. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. If people could validate identities that would go a looong way to getting rid of trolls and shills and the like. Or if there were a way to create pseudonymous identities but that are limited in supply (maybe through proof of burn), so that you can't just make a million identities. If there were a system to actually enforce this trust, it can do as much for trust in discussions and forums as bitcoin can do for money :) Of course the option to engage in anonymous or pseudonymous dialogue will still be there. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:47:39
I think those objectionable parts of the regulations are unenforceable so there is nothing to worry about. Actually I think Lawsky is a bitcoin fan, and knows they're unenforceable, but has to pay lip-service to at least trying to enforce them in order to get consensus from the establishment to move forward. When it does move forward they can't put a fence around it anyway. So these "regulations" just accelerate adoption, but won't really hinder bitcoin in the end.

Nice video, but did you read this comment?
"Ayla Falcone5 months ago
 
This is BS. I work in research (not with dogs) but adopted a retired research dog. Facilities have to be very careful in who they adopt dogs out to specifically because of people like these who demonize research. The dogs are not "only taken out to have inhumane tests done on them". USDA standards require them to have daily exercise so they are taken out of their pen daily to play and romp with the other dogs and/or technicians. Which is also why this video is BS when they say "no one knew how they would get along". The technicians play with them, give them treats (not even for tricks but just because), switch out their toys on a daily basis. The animals individual USDA number is tattooed on their ear at an early age so there is no getting rid of that. When I adopted my lab dog I was very impressed with how well she adjusted and wondered if it was the same with other lab dogs. This video shows it is. And no way would a dog who spent it's life in a cage away from other dogs and "loving human touch", tortured and abused would ever adjust this quickly. If facilities can not find adopters they have to euthanize the dogs. All that life saving medicine you give to your own pets, how do you think the medicine was made sure to work and be safe, tested on rats? So instead of demonizing research facilities ADOPT don't shop.﻿"
Anyway, I do hope humanity will be able to adapt that quickly.

Actually what you're saying is wrong.
If someone has a mining rig that mines at $200/coin, they will still sell at market price. The network payout for bitcoin will be unchanged (25 bitcoin/ 10 minutes). If such a mining rig were available to many (and not based on some super secret formula), hashrate would generally increase until marginal value = marginal cost, as you say. 
Bitcoin on the open market does not care about hashes or mining. It is completely independent of that. Hashrate adjusts in response to price, not vice versa. You are putting the cart before the horse, having the tail wag the dog, etc.

@_date: 2014-11-24 19:05:24
If you believe Bitcoin has a chance of changing the global financial system, maybe Ben Lawsky believes it too? If you look past the Lawsky-hate, his early indications were that of excitement around Bitcoin. 
The whole Bitcoin ecosystem presents itself as a major prisoner's dilemma to the existing financial system. People in the existing system either don't think Bitcoin is a threat, or they do. Those who don't think it's a threat won't try to fight it. Those who do think it's a threat realize they can profit way more by buying into the new system rather than propping up the corrupt old system. Because those who understand the threat of Bitcoin can profit from it by jumping on board, I think the transition will happen with surprisingly little resistance.
In the same way, since I think Lawsky's early excitement around Bitcoin was genuine, I think it's not entirely unlikely that he will try to join the new ecosystem.

I'm open to what you're saying, but I have a hard time imagining how institutional, routine lending could work if it is a zero sum game. I'm just restating myself here, but I think inflationary currencies do make sense for growing economies. Good for the collective, but not as good for the individual. As I said, people who need to borrow would have to settle for lesser money, and that's how economies would grow. It's probably why (among other reasons) today people take dollars, even though gold is probably superior money being much less inflationary. Also gold backed private money is essentially illegal, but I think people would still use dollar even if it weren't. If you have a specific resource that addresses this specific point/question I would definitely take a look.
@_date: 2014-06-21 15:00:49

The use of gold outside of money is not 1% of its value as money. Yes, its intrinsic value (such as it is) and its prettiness, is what it allowed it to bootstrap as money better than other metals with similar properties, but its high value today is primarily value as a form of non-inflationary money. I won't try to convince you beyond that, but you will see eventually.

No, the interest of early holders in promoting, developing, and using the currency, combined with network effects and the ability to be improved, as well as its neutrality as a platform, is why it will succeed. It's kind of like an IPO. There is already 4-5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin out there, and the holders will promote its use. If it offered no advantages over existing systems, then that would not be enough, but because digital money is the future, will absolutely transform finance, and is basically the economic singularity, it will succeed :)
Bitpay announced that around half of merchants who use bitpay hold some bitcoin. I wonder if that includes Microsoft or Dell. We know that Overstock holds some bitcoin. So ask yourself, when there is an open, neutral, efficient payment network than anyone can hold a piece of in a fair way, and that the early adopters will see the biggest benefits of, will people continue jumping on board? Yes, it's win-win-win for everyone except those who resist it tooth and nail. So no, not just shady people are promoting it, but all kinds of people and companies.

If you're not just trying to beg, even if redditors step up and give you a little, how much do you expect to get? 1000 bits? 10,000 bits, tops? I don't think you'll get much more than that.

I don't know if I agree. I know you're a troll but I'll answer anyway for the people with a legitimate interest..
Changes to bitcoin are dangerous because stability is important. The idea behind sidechains is to enable new features in an altcoin/sidechain to be built and allow them to prove themselves before they are implemented into the main blockchain. With sidechains any new altcoin can be built, backed by the value and mining power of bitcoin, without having to bootstrap its value completely from scratch. When the features prove truly worthy and safe, they may then be implemented in the main chain. This is not necessarily unsustainable, and is a conservative way to test new features before implementing them.
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:18:04
Completely agree. It is risk aversion on the part of the advice giver. The upside is not really so high if you're not the one investing the money.... so if you are giving advice better to give fair warning so they don't have your head if they lose it all.

The consensus I'm referring to is among the hidden players of the financial world who I'm sure Lawsky confers with, as well as other Law and Order types. They are truly stuck and have no course of action to even try to fight this (while the smart ones try to benefit from it), but at least the regulations will give them the illusion that they are doing something to maintain power, and I believe that will actually accelerate the inevitable.
If you remember as recently as a year ago, before the US Marshals SR Bitcoin auction,  and before the Senate hearings, we had no idea the USG would be as on-board and supportive as they've been. You and I believed in Bitcoin because we thought it would prevail despite outright government crackdown. If regulations allow bitcoin to develop more quickly I think it will only accelerate the time when the economic benefit of bitcoin is so large that there is simply no going back or trying to maintain ridiculous regulations.
I mean, think about it this way. Bitcoin is not really unstoppable. If they needed to, they can stop bitcoin (as well as copyright infringement and other issues) entirely by just shutting down the entire internet. But there is simply too much economic and societal benefit, and vested interest, in keeping the internet active to even think about trying to shut it down. So too, when 1000 flowers bloom (with or without Lawsky's permission), there will be no way to reverse that tide. The resulting economic flourishing will overtake all the regulations like a tsunami. 
So while I don't know if it will actually make a big difference in the end, I think maybe it actually makes more sense to go along with the regulations rather than point out quite how absurd they are. Just the appearance of control and Law and Order will enable Wall Street investment, which in turn will accelerate bitcoin economic development. Whereas if we all point out how absurd the regulations are maybe there will be hesitation around legitimizing it, slowing down Wall Street exchanges, ETFs, and the like, which would be a blow to the still-not-yet guaranteed fixture of bitcoin into our national and global economie. So I think maybe it's better to do what we can to allow bitcoin to progress economically, and the technology will ultimately solve and/or reveal the absurdity of the discussed regulatory approaches. But of course I'm not saying we should just remain silent; it probably doesn't hurt to dialogue rationally about the potential harms of regulation. I just don't think this will doom anything in the end (except maybe NY's stature in global finance).
You're certainly right, I'm feeling bullish today :)

Where does the logic fail? Bitcoin is an earth-shattering innovation that once it bootstraps can replace all credit/debit payment networks AND most of the gold value. Not to mention smart contracts which is an entirely new market because it previously did not exist. If gold sitting in vaults uselessly and expensively can be worth $9 trillion, I think $20 trillion for total bitcoin evaluation is a conservative estimate.

@_date: 2014-10-22 16:42:23
I think it still applies. Of course it runs on top of the internet. That's really not the point. Filesharing does not have quite the same network effects that telecommunication and money has. The Internet grew out of the interconnection of many disparate networks into on large interconnected one. In the same way, many relatively disconnected currencies will coalesce into one network. 
The reason "The Internet" is "The Internet" is because it was in everybody's best interest to use a common rprotocol for a global network. There were other potential protocols, but TCP/IP won out. According to your logic, "The Internet" is not "The Internet" because TCP/IP is just one networking protocol that computers may or may not participate in.
I've heard some tech guy from Google say Bitcoin is the TCP/IP of money. It's the same idea. 
Of course it runs "on the internet" but that's really not the point.
Bitcoin will only be "the Internet of Money" if it wins out and prevails as the predominant global financial backbone. So at this stage calling it that is a bit of predictive, hopeful thinking :) But I do think at this stage it is the best candidate for an Internet of Money.

You have no idea whether this is actually true or not. After 4 or 5 or more order of magnitude jumps (depending on when you start counting), the market cap is still only about 10 billion. I'd say we have potentially at least 2 more separate 1000% jumps, maybe 3 (so up to a 1000x increase from here). 
If after relatively continuous exponential growth (look on the log scale and see how linear that is...), it would be quite weird if it just stopped on a dime especially as Wall street and other institutional money is just getting in. 
This is somewhat outdated, but so far still seems to hold:  Though is a bit under the trend at the moment, according to the projection expected price is 924. A buy signal perhaps?
EDIT: I see the downvote / FUD brigade is still in action. Yes it's a risky move. However I think all the negative talk here is meant to keep the price low while people who missed out in the auction (and the like) try to get in before the next spike (which is imminent). OP: BUY

Why can't ethereum develop that?
If I can elaborate. Let's say ethereum starts picking up steam, and people are using bitcoin to purchase ethers in order to run smart contracts and other DApps that only ethereum can do. Let's say it takes longer, but give it 5 years, or 10 years to pick up steam. Then at that point, ethers are digital currency that actually is backed by something, the ability to do Turing complete computation on a distributed blockchain, whereas bitcoins have no such function. I don't think "backing" is *required* for value (case in point, bitcoin), but given two alternatives, one that has value AND function and one that is simply value without any other use, then the one with function should overtake it, given enough time.
This is why I think if Bitcoin wants to *stay* the leader, it eventually has to incorporate ethereum functionality. Even if there is an ethereum sidechain, eventually, ethereum's value may overshadow bitcoin if bitcoin itself does not implement the features. 
Of course, this is only holds if there are no technical reasons that a Turing-complete blockchain can't operate as efficiently as the Bitcoin blockchain for transferring value.

Agreed. It's all about the network effect. Just as there is only one internet, there will be only one MAIN network of transferring value. That being said, there will probably be many secondary currencies because you can't really lend out a currency that is limited in supply, among a host of other reasons. So people who need to get a project off the ground on credit will have to settle for lesser forms of money, and that's where multiple currencies will come in. Just like we have private networks even though there is also an internet. So like the internet there will be really only one main value transfer network. Hopefully bitcoin.

Right now worldwide wealth is on the order of $200 trillion.
If economic growth continues, maybe one day that could grow to 10,000 trillion (50x increase in wealth). Previous economic singularities have increased world-wide wealth many times more than that 50-fold increase, so as technology continues to accelerate, and as perhaps bitcoin itself helps accelerate economic growth, that shouldn't be TOO far off (40 years? 100 years?)
If BTC is the only worldwide currency at that future point, then we would be at $500,000,000 / BTC

The "bitcoin" unit can simply fall away, and then we are left with simply bits and satoshis. The word "Bitcoin" may then only refer to the protocol. Of course people will remember that "Bitcoin" meant a million bits at one, and might even be used sometimes, like how people say a "mill" to mean a million, or a G for a thousand, or other non-standard names, but there can be just two main units: bit and satoshi. "Bit" is certainly simpler than "Bitcoin" so if you like simple you should be on board :)

You're right, it either is or isn't a ponzi scheme, and it isn't. But I would argue it is indeed more similar to ponzi schemes than bitcoin is. Fractional reserve banking is based on giving out more credits or funds than what you actually have to back it up. Every time you withdraw money, it's like they're saying "see you can always withdraw money, so never mind that we don't actually have enough for everyone". That is similar to ponzi schemes which give some initial return to gain trust. There are also many differences. FRB is sustainable, while ponzi schemes are not. Some may argue FRB is healthy (though I would debate that), while ponzi schemes are universally agreed to be malicious, fraudulent schemes.
Bitcoin is nothing like either of these, and it promises nothing more than the security of a notation in a ledger, which represents nothing more than itself. It has more in common with gold than paper-based, central bank issued currency and FRB systems.

Wow that makes so much sense. I guess we don't think of two person escrow because with normal assets this isn't possible. But with crypto we can have a multisig transaction where it's not like if I'm holding the other person's money in escrow I can just keep it for myself. It's either stop the transaction or let it go back to the person who put it in. No chance of taking it for yourself. That's really cool. 
But still I can see potential problems. What if the person sends the product but it's not the right thing or it's slightly defective. Do you hold the money in escrow not releasing it to punish the vendor, but hurting yourself in the process? It seems like a high bar for the injustice to be bad enough that you're willing to harm yourself (losing the escrow money) in the name of justice.

@_date: 2014-10-23 19:17:39
If a new coin adds 100 GH/s of hashing power, it has only 100 GH/s to protect itself. If we have "one chain to rule them all" it can add 100 GH/s to the 100 Exahash or whatever, mutually benefiting themselves and everyone. So yes, new coins bring added value and added hashing along with it, but the point still remains that "one chain" is stronger than a collection of blockchains.

Ethereum offers real advantages over Bitcoin however... Its "quasi-Turing complete" blockchain could make all other coins obsolete.

@_date: 2014-07-02 21:51:29
It's not the inverse. It's the same thing.
Think about it this way. Imagine you live in an apartment building, and instead of billing each apartment separately for electricity, you just divide total usage by number of apartments and bill everyone equally. This is classic tragedy of the commons. 
In this setup, the behavior of using more electricity is good for the individual, since the added cost to him is negligible. However it is bad for the group, since if everyone does this no one will try to moderate their usage. 
I was comparing non-inflationary currencies in a similar way. When you have a non-inflationary currency, your money is not diluted (good for the individual). However, if, as I argued, it's difficult to lend money, this is bad for society, since there is no credit and therefore growth is difficult and not fluid. 
Now, don't get me wrong AT ALL. I don't think non-inflationary currencies are bad. I'm obviously big bitcoin supporter. I think you can have your cake and eat it too by having multiple currencies. Despite that, I think we share similar views that the "main" store of and transmitter of value will be pretty much a single network, similar to how we have one internet, as I've expressed earlier. 
So the picture I am painting is: bitcoin as a main network of value, non-inflationary, most desired and most widely accepted currency. Sort of the "gold standard" of digital money. And then around that will be a whole constellation of other currencies / assets / entities that have to do with credit and lending which will be inflationary in nature, to match the nature of growing economies. 
None of this needs to be based on debt.

I don't think it's quite as pat and simple as I made it sound but...
I think even if enforceable (through blocking NY IPs, TOR, VPNs), it will be extremely easy to get around. As bitcoin grows the absurdity of the NY regs (if they are implemented as described, which I doubt), and the extent to which it harms NY, will become more and more clear. It will simply not stand the test of time. 
This has been passed around on reddit a lot, but I'll put it here for for all to see again, being relevant to the previous paragraph: 
Also, if you listen to Lawsky talk about Bitcoin, I think it's really clear he is a fan. I don't think he is that good of an actor, or some kind of devious agent trying to deceive the bitcoin community into thinking he likes it but really wants to crack down. Remember that Lawsky has actually been relatively tough on Wall Street, which no one on seems to be mentioning much. See this article: 
Maybe I am being optimistic as you say, but I think he actually likes the openness and fairness of bitcoin. But as a politician he still has the job of brokering consensus.

I agree. Right, where is Peter Todd's analysis demonstrating that 1MB is optimal? He claims he wants all these analyses done like a risk analysis, but where is his analysis regarding staying at the status quo? Inevitably, by ANY analysis, of course the blocksize limit will have to increase at some point. Even if everything is running on a Bitcoin Lightning network, they estimate we will need 133MB blocks. 
So, when Peter Todd says raising the blocksize limit is a "band-aid" it is so incongruous that it makes me suspicious. No matter how much you disagree with it, and for whatever good reasons, it's not a "band-aid". This honestly makes me suspect that Peter Todd is some kind of troll/disrupter representing someone who's goal is to interfere with bitcoin. /tinfoil

I think it's pretty absurd to claim an increased blocksize will lead to a "much more centralised network". The costs of mining are already quite high. Just because you can't mine at home doesn't mean it's "centralised". Mining would be an open market as always and there would be no monopoly on participating. Therefore I believe market forces would keep it open and not controlled by any single party. Lightning network is great and all but the blocksize needs to increase regardless. The blocksize limit was an artificial and arbitrary restriction; removing it is not a "band aid".

I was thinking of this post
But maybe I misunderstood, because I guess a "savers' fee" would not be the same as inflation.
But still, I think a saver's fee is silly. I think Amanojack describes it well: 
All savers are eventually spenders. So there is little reason to "tax twice". And the savers who NEVER spend... well clearly they are subsidizing the economy by increasing the value of everyone else's coins. 
A saver's fee simply doesn't make any sense.

But it is important even in frictionless transfer, because people will mainly want the thing that other people want the most. Money is an all or nothing process. There have been multiple forms of money in the past for reasons, but in an interconnected digital world, there is no reason to have multiple forms, and the push will be towards a single form, just from sort of evolutionary pressures. People most want the form of money that other people want the most. That's the main reason why. 
And there is nothing un-decentralized about having a single network. It is not anti- the spirit of bitcoin. Like I said, I think the analogy of the Internet is accurate. We can have one single network that is completely decentralized. One network is efficient because then there is no friction and no barrier. The Internet can become even more decentralized (mesh networks, etc.), and yet still be a single network, all running on the same root and the same protocol of TCP/IP. So too, there is no reason why there is any problem, and there are many good reasons, to have a single network of value transfer.
Another equally important reason is the way blockchain security works. Two blockchains are much less secure than one blockchain of equal hashing power to both combined. If we have many blockchains they will all be less secure. That's why if we need a new coin or digital asset that requires a blockchain, it will probably be as a sidechain in the future. Therefore I maintain we will see one main base layer of value transfer (main blockchain) and everything else will be layers on top of it (like we have with the modern Internet). There will also be sidechains.
And yes, friction between networks is an issue. There is financial friction just in trading, even in very efficient digital markets. This, while not the main issue, will also be a subtle but significant evolutionary push towards a single chain.

It's an interesting idea that bitcoin will retain its niche while more functional systems co-exist with it. I understand that money retains its value because of a self-sustaining bubble effect. The money that people want is the money that *other* people want the most. So the desire and therefore the value of a given money such as gold, or bitcoin, can sustain itself over time. However, in the face of a clearly superior alternative, I think that effect wanes. That's why I'm betting against gold in the long run. It survived until now because 1) for most of history it was superior money 2) in the age of fiat, which is more useful in many ways, gold was still a better store of value because it is not as inflationary as fiat. However, in the face of bitcoin I don't think gold can retain its value in the long-run.
In the same way, I'm not convinced that any coin will retain its niche just because that was its original function/intention. Bitcoin was created as merely e-cash, but may eventually become a ledger for all things. If ethereum is a superset of bitcoin, and if ethers represent not just value for the sake of value, but also function, ie ethers are actually useful for something besides transferring value itself, then couldn't it eventually become the preferred form of money ? Regardless of the original intention? 
I think the ethereum dev team and community says bitcoin and ethereum can co-exist to minimize conflict and maximize cooperation, but I'm sure some of them believe that if ethereum really succeeds, there might be no reason for bitcoin to be used anymore.
The only problem I see with that scenario is that bitcoin is a better store of value because it is non-inflationary, whereas ethereum has linear inflation. But even gold has (more than) linear inflation, so if ethers were actually useful for running code I don't know if the inflation (which decreases over time percentage-wise), would stop ethereum from being preferred.
Don't get me wrong. I don't think Bitcoin's network effect would be easily overcome. There would probably be plenty of warning if another chain like ethereum were actually threatening bitcoin's existence, and then a response will be made. I think that response might have to include adopting the features of ethereum. I'm still not convinced that bitcoin can survive without adopting similar features in the main chain. Even as a sidechain, I think eventually if it is popular enough, the sidechain could grow to main chain status.
Maybe this is too far off to speculate about, but I am curious to hear different perspectives on this question.

I disagree. One common network, one lingua franca, is vastly more efficient than a balkanized network of many types. We only have one internet, not a series of distinct network types. The same applies to money. I'm not saying there won't be sidechains or specialized coins for specialized features, but the efficiency of having one network underlying it all will become clear.

There being a conflict of interest doesn't mean that one will act on that conflict. But the fact that increasing the blocksize limit reduces the value of layer 2 solutions, on which blockstream's business model depends, is simply reality. There is nothing to dispute that a conflict of interest exists. They of course at the same time want Bitcoin to succeed. But they are willing to take bigger risks in hindering Bitcoin than the rest of us who understand this because they stand more to gain.

Price will remain high as long as capacity can always accommodate demand, and price will grow with that usage. When things start getting congested people will look elsewhere. I think a "can kick" is good if it makes things smooth for users while off-chain solutions are also developed simultaneously. A big part of capitalization is speculation about future use/adoption, so I don't believe you can claim that impeding small payments has marginal impact on capitalization.
 
Appearance of authoritarian control in a supposedly decentralized system diminishes trust, which affects price. Large volume of small transactions is part of what gives/will give Bitcoin a "floor"in price. Bitcoin will not retain its value if it's not actually used for anything. It will not become the new gold alone. It has to be visa in order to also be gold. Now I'm not saying all the visa-level stuff must be on chain, but if things stutter too much along its growth, confidence will be shaken, and bitcoin's position as defacto leader can be displaced. I think allowing smooth growth is important here. 2MB will buy another year for LN and other systems to be developed, which the free market will then choose among. 
The other issue is that core tactics actually stoke conspiracy theories that the small blockists are trying to destroy bitcoin.
EDIT: also small payments should directly affect capitalization as many more people will need to hold "just a few coins" for when they want to spend. That long tail could equal or surpass the capital held by "true believer" hodlers. I'm not sure at all why you think impeding small payments would have marginal impact on capitalization.
EDIT EDIT: Also, a growing long tail would attract even more long-term speculative hodlers. The fact is, the only reason this ISN'T a ponzi scheme as many skeptics claimed is because it is actually incredibly useful. If that usefulness is limited not for technical reasons but for other reasons (backed by false technical arguments) then something else WILL take its place.

That's a fair and decent point, and shifts my view a little. I still think the resistance you are showing to an increased blocksize seems a bit unreasonable. 20MB blocksize limit doesn't necessarily seem to lead to any easier time regulating mining. NOT increasing the blocksize limit however seems like it could dangerously slow Bitcoin's growth. I'd rather we anticipate a crisis situation than react to one.
EDIT: 






I don't think an increased blocksize limit would change any of that. 20MB is still quite modest. Gavin has addressed the technical requirements and has discussed the intention to take a slow ramp up (40% per year). Why do you and nullc take such a black-and-white view on increasing blocksize limit? Isn't a modest increase that is still moderate in technical requirements a good balance? What conditions exactly do you require before you would agree with a blocksize limit?

I am with you for the most part, in principle. Where I diverge is not that I think Bitcoin MUST be visa for it to have value. Certainly it CAN in theory have value even with a relatively low throughput. BUT. I believe cryprocurrency will be for the most part winner takes all. If not purely winner takes all, I believe there will be one dominant player as the main chain. If Bitcoin is artificially being limited, then a chain that is more visa-like (while still maintaining more than good enough stability and reliability), will outcompete a Bitcoin that is artificially constrained. That will prevent Bitcoin from being the new gold. Network effects are why I think visa-like-ness and gold-like-ness will tend to go together (not that it is strictly necessary). Value of money occurs in a positive-feedback loop of circular logic. The coin that has more utility will have more value, and the coin that has more value will have more utility, in a self-propelling loop. If Bitcoin is artificially constrained, it can open the door for something to step in and take the lead. Once something has the lead, it's pretty much over. This can happen very rapidly and unexpectedly. I think this is a dangerous game of chicken.
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:48:11
Like I said -- having a conflict doesn't mean one will act on it. But since Blockstream's stated business model depends on Layer 2 solutions, I think the existence of a potential conflict is crystal clear. 
Are you familiar with group selection in evolutionary theory? It's kind of like that. You can have co-existing and opposing drives within an organism. For example, individual bacteria evolve to become more virulent. A more virulent bacterial cell will outcompete the other cells infecting an organism. At the same time, if the population of bacteria as a whole becomes too virulent it will kill the host, killing the goose that laid the golden egg so to speak. So there are pressures to prevent cells from evolving too virulently, because it puts the whole population in jeopardy. (It's actually been a controversial theory at times because Richard Dawkins has strongly opposed it, but there's a lot of evidence for this nevertheless.)
In the same way, Blockstream wants Bitcoin to succeed, but because their business model depends on Layer 2 solutions, they stand to benefit if Bitcoin develops in a way that emphasizes layer 2. It's simply a fact that there is a *potential* conflict there. Maybe you're right-- maybe in our reality there happens to not be a conflict, if it happens to be the case Bitcoin absolutely should not scale by increasing blocksize limit at this time. But it is simply a fact that a potential conflict exists where those two approaches diverge. If increasing the blocksize limit is in Bitcoin's best interest at some point in time (maybe now is not the time, there are many opinions on this), and they still oppose it, that is evidence of them acting on their conflict of interest. 
Now in my opinion their logic does not add up, their tactics have been tellingly underhanded, and I believe their behavior in this regard is explained by this apparent potential conflict of interest.
But my own opinion aside, it is simply a fact that a potential conflict exists given their business model. And the amazing concentration of influence they have over development compared to any other company provides a realistic means of acting on their conflict.

Well I think the origins of FRB was not done with consent, so historically I think that was fraud. Agreed, banking is not inherently fraud since it is done with consent. But I think it's debatable, considering there are not really alternatives to banking (until bitcoin).
Also, I think if you are working with a non-inflationary asset like bitcoin (esp. when 99%+ of coins are mined), interest does not make sense. FRB in that case should be considered fraud just as Ponzi schemes are fraud (whether consensual or not), because lending will be a zero sum game and someone will inevitably be left holding the bag.

Which is it? If there is no alternative then perhaps it is a necessary evil. You are simply stating that "centralization breeds... etc. etc." but can you back that up? I think an open system that anyone can join and is subject to competitive forces should remain free and fair regardless of whether it is structured as hubs and spokes. If big blocks are adopted, and LN is only used for settling microtransactions (ie, even relatively small [but not micro] transactions can be settled on the block chain) then that would serve as further competition against any particular hub gaining control of the whole network. Just as biology itself is a decentralized system, but still organizes into hubs and spokes for efficiency (think the human brain), so too any given structure is not inherently good or evil. What is important is that balances evolve to prevent power concentration. But all of this will evolve quite organically on its own regardless of what you and I blather on about, so I suppose there is no point in trying to convince anyone.

Ethereum has a much lower transaction fee at the moment (0.15 USD), and there are a similar number of total transactions to bitcoin. Sounds good for ethereum, but it means that inherent demand is a lot lower. Also, transaction volume isn't as much the issue as liquidity into other forms of money. Exchange volume is a good indicator. Much higher in bitcoin. Besides, ethereum is not decentralized, is a legal target, and has no clear monetary policy. Smart contracts may be useful, but it ain't replacing bitcoin as the store of value blockchain.

What % of the global economy is Bitcoin right now? He made it clear he was referring to right now, not the future state if Bitcoin achieves its potential. I'm guessing the % of Bitcoin / Global economy is smaller than the % of NY / Global population.
Let's try it in terms of market cap. 
NY State population is roughly 20 million. Global population is 7 billion. So NY State is 1/350th of the world population. 
Value of total Bitcoins in circulation (overestimated upper bound, because many are lost) = 15 million bitcoins * $265/bitcoin = roughly $4 billion. 
Since the global economy is much larger than $1.4 trillion ($4 billion * 350), Bitcoin is a much smaller fraction of the global economy than the NY State fraction of the global population. 
However, I do agree with you (and with parent poster gta0012), that in the long-run this will hurt NY more than Bitcoin. But now, not so much.

OK I'm going to put out a movie and release it in only one theater. Only people who are desperate to see it will be able to pay for the tickets. I will be able to charge 100 or even 1000 dollars per seat. Even if people were willing to pay that you will probably make less money then releasing it at normal prices in many theaters. Unless demand were so low that only one theater is appropriate. But one wouldn't artificially limit the number of theaters to be lower than what demand dictates in order to make *more* money.
There is only so much people will be willing to pay to make a transaction on the blockchain. Total transaction fees is (price per transaction) * (number of transactions). If you severely limit the number of transactions, total fees are limited. Even if price per transaction goes up to match the decrease in number of transactions,  you have severely limited bitcoin's usefulness. Fees, just like mining itself, should be priced based on the marginal cost to process one transaction. Yes it is vanishingly small. But when block rewards go away, and miners are competing just to process transactions, such an equilibrium will be reached (with a small profit built in). More transactions will mean more fees for miners.
Also remember network effects... if Bitcoin's usefulness is limited, then doing a transaction is less worthwhile. If we make Bitcoin extremely useful then # of transactions and price per transaction may both go up. If Bitcoin is very unuseful indeed (if no one uses it) then price per transaction will naturally fall together with number of transacions.

I completely agree. LN is perfect for transactions that need instant confirmation or which have very small transaction size.
But if we stick with small blocks (or grow at 17% per year), and force transactions into LN that might otherwise be on BN (beyond just instant or microtransactions), the worry is that more transaction fees would go to LN hubs rather than miners, thereby weakening Bitcoin security. 
What seems fine about LN vs. Visa is that at least it is still an open platform. Anyone can be "Visa" and anyone can compete. But if small-blockinistas have their way, more types of transactions will be inappropriately shunted to LN, and it seems to me, weakening Bitcoin fundamental mining security in the process.
@_date: 2015-08-21 02:26:14
Bitcoin is a completely voluntary system and anyone should be able to suggest changes for improvement, to any software implementation or via a hardfork. But all players need to coordinate with each other to decide what are worthwhile changes (1MB vs. 8MB?) and also to signal to each other what they believe and what they do, so that others can send similar or opposing signals, and decide their plans appropriately.
We now have a loose confederation of tools to communicate in this way. Developer mailing lists, reddit, twitter, websites, etc. all serve this function. However, could something like Liquid Feedback help grease the wheels of this process if used in addition to existing means?

What's so bad about LN anyway? As Bitcoin itself demonstrates, it's not centralized vs. decentralized that is so much the issue, it is openness of the platform. The internet is also composed of many "hubs" or backbones. But since it is an open platform and subject to competition, no one can take total control. Same goes for LN. I think if anyone can be a hub competition will keep things free and fair if not completely flat in the hierarchical sense. Hubs are not so bad. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:14:36
Better than ever.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:04:47
Or: have no limit (or a generous limit) AND implement LN and let the free market find the most efficient distribution. If the cap is artificially limited to be below what demand would otherwise be, then total transaction fees would be lower. Less transactions = less fees. You could have half as many transactions and total fees might be more than half. I'm not saying it is completely linear. Certainly fees would go up. But it's a pretty safe bet that total fees would go down. All else being equal, would you rather fees go to miners who secure the network or LN hubs? I think LN hubs will be useful and necessary, but we should have as many on chain transactions as is technically feasible, in order to secure the network. More fees means 51% attacks are harder.

A BIP has been submitted. See BIP 101.
There is nothing control-freak-y about this. XT simply will not be adopted by 75% of miners if core provides a real solution first. But if shit starts hitting the fan and everyone sees that when capacity is reached, and core *still* does not fix it, then there will be an easy exit plan for everyone to fall back on. That's the idea behind the XT fork. No one has appointed core from on high to be the only bitcoin implementation. To act as if they are the ultimate authority on what bitcoin may become is the Control Freak approach.

The flaw is tragedy of the commons. Assurance contract or not, why would I put up money when whatever I put up is likely not the be the one to make or break the deal? Why not let everyone else give while I sit back and enjoy the benefits? Something like this can be made successful through social pressures which can publicly shame those who don't contribute, but I don't see a trustless global economy being based on a donation system such as that. I usually agree with Mike Hearn's perspective but I think he's off here (and perhaps a bit biased with his stake in Lighthouse). I think in the future we will need lots of on-chain transactions to keep mining profitable.

@_date: 2015-08-16 23:55:13
The problem with relying too heavily on Lightning is that reducing block rewards needs to be matched by increasing transaction fees in order to keep mining steady. Yes, rising prices will help. But no, price will not continue to double every 4 years until 2140 to match decreasing block rewards. Lightning will have its place but if all or most transaction fees go to Lightning instead of miners, mining and therefore Bitcoin security will collapse.
I believe one of the best ways to increase transactions fees is to increase the number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:05:14
It will happen.

We must accept some risk in achieving growth. Taking no risk is a bigger risk. If there are problems due to large block size we can adjust as we go. This is evolution baby. This means taking action, observing error, correcting for error, and repeat.

You can't have it both ways. You can't say costs of mining is both too much and yet say it is not enough (in terms of transaction fees). Subsidy will decrease, and transaction fees will increase. Let's say transaction fees are equal to block reward after 4th halving. That's still 40Billion per year at $500k/btc. According to my estimations, about 60 billion dollars worth of new gold is mined every year, so I assume the cost of mining is in that ballpark.
EDIT: Making up for the shortfall doesn't have to mean it will make up for it in total BTC. It will make up for it in value. As value of BTC goes up, less BTC will be required to sustain the network in transaction fees (though total transaction fees will likely go up or stay steady from here in BTC terms because the network will also be growing).
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:42:23
We should go straight for bits
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:49:02
By 2030 block reward will halve 3 times, so that's 40 billion a year. A lot but still less than is spent on gold mining this year. Might even be 4 halvings by 2030. At the 4th halving, at 2032 the latest, it will be only 20 billion per year at that price. Very reasonable figure for securing the world's global financial backbone.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:05:55
I disagree that market cap has a big relation on how much mining reward needs to be. If a 51% attack costs 20 billion to attempt, it doesn't matter if market cap is 100B or 1T or 10T. In any case it will be unprofitable. It's not like breaking into a vault. 51% attack does not mean you get to steal all the bitcoins. More like you disrupt the network (probably only temporarily) and probably crash the value somewhat. What does an attacker gain? So again I will state my opinion that adequate security is not necessarily based on a fixed percentage of market cap.

Except perhaps indirectly. It won't create a "fair" distribution from the start, but it does eliminate a constant source of arguably corrupt and unfair distribution of wealth through the current money creation process. Ending that will probably be a net positive for wealth distribution.

Why would Gavin "power grab" when he specifically stepped down from lead maintainer because he didn't want to be benevolent dictator? When he was given sole commit access by Satoshi (as Satoshi had), he brough in two others to have commit access, and then the three of them collectively (not Gavin alone) brought on two more, for a total of five? Why would this man who clear wants Bitcoin to be a decentralized organism, not a top down hierarchy, suddenly want to "power grab"?

Could be smallblockinistas or one of the core devs, or it could be a false flag by XTers to make the small blockinistas look bad. My hunch is it's not a false flag and it goes to show the bad faith of the anti-XT/anti-BIP 101 (yes I'm lumping them together here) crowd.

What counts as "spam"? The system should not have to distinguish spam. How does the USPS recognize spam? They don't have to because everyone pays postage. If transaction fees are sufficient to pay for the cost of the transaction, with a little profit for the miner, then there is no such thing as spam. "Spam" should bring in more profits for miners and thereby make the Bitcoin network stronger, not weaker.

I think the evolution analogy is imperfect but pretty good in fact. Human systems have advantages over raw biological evolution in that we can plan things out and simulate them (in our minds, with pencil and paper, or with math and computers), instead of trying things based on random mutations (I implied before that evolution wasn't random, but I was referring to the results; the source of variation is indeed pretty random). Also, we are not going to make billions of blockchains and have them all compete, as you might in strict biological evolution.
But like evolution, we can do things in a somewhat empirical and experimental way. Try it and see what works. Get all the biggest minds together, have a sort of delegated democracy ("delegated" because many users are not making decisions on their own, but based on what their preferred expert says, e.g. are you a Hearn guy, or a Todd guy?), and then put the damn thing into action. If it doesn't work, or if there is some flaw, we will just fork again. This is why it's like evolution. It will sort of snake around and find the path of least resistance along the way to optimization.
I have nothing against experts or groups of experts (what I called a "cabal"). The problem is, when we enshrine any particular group as an authority, then there is major potential for corruption, or if nothing else, mistakes. So it's not cabals per se that i don't like, but absolute authority. In fact, I love cabals. I love cabals so much that I think we should have many cabals! The cabals should compete and propose competing platforms or ideas, and we should collectively choose among them. 
Suppose decision making in Core gets so congealed, that they simply can't make the necessary improvements. And suppose at the same time "contentious" forks are so frowned upon that nobody is willing to adopt one. If that happens, then an altcoin will step up and make the improvements that Bitcoin fails to make. Would you rather this new altcoin start with a new coin distribution, or one that it is based on Bitcoin's distribution? If the latter, then you don't have an altcoin, you have a "contentious" fork. 
My opinion is that discussing this is not going to make much of a difference. Game theory predicts these outcomes. I just think there will be a lot less friction and wasted energy the sooner people realize it. We are all free people and we are free to use Bitcoin, new forks, or altcoins, whichever serves us best. If Bitcoin core fails to adapt, I believe the economic and game theoretic forces means a "contentious" fork WILL be adopted. And I believe there is nothing morally wrong about this, and is in fact in the very spirit of bitcoin. 
But sure, better governance and consensus building systems that are resistant to corruption couldn't hurt -- but only because that would make them more competitive against "contentious" forks, not because we have a moral obligation not to fork. 
Sorry for the wall of text, I got inspired.
PS people want money with no authority that is robust to censorship and control. These features make this form of money MORE certain than any other form, not less. People's paradigms are not ready for this yet, but eventually they will be. Having an "unknown future" is not as much of an issue after it proves itself robustly. I am predicting that this is the best way to maintaining robustness.

Let a thousand blockchains bloom, and let just one survive. The one that survives will be an evolutionary optimization of all the parameters that enable it to better survive than all the others, not one that neatly fits your preconceived ideology. Decentralization and scaling are both essential qualities, and where and how to compromise one to what extent in order to support the other is something that is an optimization process, not an execise of belief, or faith, or adherence to scripture.

The idea that bitcoin is narrowly political, and that if you pick the "green" team instead of the "ayn rand" team it makes a difference, is pretty clueless to me. If you replace Ven and Bitcoin with AOL and the internet, I think to say "oh the internet is just a bunch of ayn rand libertarians" would be equally clueless. Obviously the technology challenges established political power in a certain way, but it can't be pinned narrowly to a given ideology, and even if its users were all Ayn Rand fans (which they're not) it wouldn't confine the underlying technology, regardless. The internet serves the full spectrum of political views, and similarly Bitcoin isn't just for "Ayn rand libertarians". It's also clueless for thinking Bitcoin is un-green because it requires power for security.

He wants development to occur through less personal, authority by name, expertise, and more through what works and consensus of the entire ecosystem as a whole, through voting mechanisms. In such a scenario, XT would not be seen as the enemy-- if it was worthwhile, then people will switch, if it's not then people won't switch and it's not a threat regardless. It's all based on the principles of decentralization, autonomy, and voluntarism, not edicts decreed from on high.

Should there be a mechanism to allow a sidechain to become a mainchain? This may sound like a threat to Bitcoin, but I think it could also be an asset. For example, if Bitcoin Core doesn't increase transaction volume capacity, then XT might grow in popularity. But if Core stagnates, could the whole thing eventually collapse? A tugboat can pull a battleship, but a canoe with a small motor could not! I'm thinking maybe a mechanism for treating main chains and sidechains in the same way could increase the ability for Bitcoin to evolve in adaptive ways. What do you think about this?

Only you are making that assumption. You are making an assumption that the visionary creator of Bitcoin would have no interest in using that money to make the world a better place. I personally think if he is a single actor and not some NSA team, that he will indeed use the money to create some kind of super-trust for incubating world improving decentralized technologies building on Bitcoin, and perhaps even more fundamental issues like poverty and hunger, putting the Gates Foundation to shame.

Yes, I agree. Nothing in life is guaranteed....
However, if it's not Bitcoin it will be something else, because it is simply too useful for it to not happen. So it's pretty much a "when" for cryptocurrency, if not Bitcoin specifically.
But if you accept that premise and look deeper, you may start to realize that network effects will make it very hard to overtake Bitcoin. I think almost impossible. You may disagree :)
If you put those together, I think it does become ALMOST a "when". But yeah, in general it's foolish to think anything is an absolute certainty. But I think it is way more close to certain than it might appear on the surface.

You need irreversibility and no central authority as the base layer for something to really be trusted not to be abused or corrupted. On TOP of that layers of accountability, reversibility, and insurance will be built. That is how our current system works as well.

It's about capital not divisibility. If there are a billion users, they probably would have something like the equivalent $1000 each in the system. That's a trillion. Could be a lot higher when you count all the rich people. All the gold in the world is worth 6-9 trillion and it just sits in vaults expensively and is not used for transacting. I think a $1 trillion Bitcoin economy is a conservative figure, and that's $50,000 per coin. It could go to a $20 trillion economy or more. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:57:16
I don't know why so many people have such a hard time with this. Obviously it means the impact of Bitcoin will be bigger than the impact the Internet has had *until now*, independent of Bitcoin. To use your set terminology, the subset is bigger than the superset minus the subset.

I was thinking something like that too. Imagine Bitcoin reaches $1 million per coin. Then imagine Satoshi puts $950 billion towards freedom promoting technologies and other charitable works. The impact on the world would be phenomenal. The last $50B is for hookers and blow for him and everyone he knows.

Speculating is part of the process of bootstrapping a currency from nothing. You can be sure that when it goes to $10,000 a coin some of these speculators will start spending some of their profits :) And then lots more merchants will crop up to accept this new wealth from people. Then more people will notice, and a new crop of speculators will jump in. 
It's like reaching an equilibrium in chemistry. If the value goes up enough then people will start to spend more.
Eventually when the price stabilizes (let's say at 1 bit = $1, ie, $1 million/btc) then speculation will no longer play a big role, apart maybe from day traders and other financial instruments which will actually be part of keeping the price stable.

If everything was already factored in, the price would already be where it will eventually be -- likely $100,000-$1,000,000 per coin. Of course it is not there because the market is not totally efficient, in other words people are not perfectly smart -- most people do not even know what Bitcoin is, let alone know where it is headed. Furthermore, among the people who do understand, they don't have infinite money. Even among those with a lot of money and understand perfectly, they know others do not, and so will try to get more by waiting things out and manipulating price and sentiment. 
Nothing in physics is perfectly efficient, so I think it's absurd to think the market is perfectly efficient -- though as an approximation it can be a useful idea. The fact is, as openbit points out, there is a certain amount of money right now chasing bitcoin, and after the halving there will be (as an approximation) the same amount of money chasing half as many new bitcoins per unit time. And as we know, when price goes up, it attracts more investment, not less, so probably the amount of money chasing bitcoin will go UP even as bitcoin supply rate goes down.
Of course, those who are buying Bitcoin in the meantime want you to believe in the efficient market hypothesis because they want to buy as many as they can as cheaply as they can, while they can. I have as many Bitcoins as I'll ever have, and am looking forward to the price rise, so I'm happy to disabuse you of that notion.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:51:25
Whether people say it or not, I believe it will happen that way. It's not a matter of convincing people, it's just what is the most efficient. It's like evolution. I'm making a prediction, not an argument meant to persuade people to make it come to fruition.

I said this on a few other threads, but I'll say it again here:
I don't think this will kill bitcoin. I was worried at first, but after thinking about it, regular bitcoins will exist just as they would in a world where government was not "on board" with bitcoin. Validated bitcoins will be worth more because government is ok with it (nothing to fight against, less chance of confiscation, etc.). You can't expect government to be as on board with it as they seem to be, while also not trying to treat it like traditional banking/money. But the regular, un-validated addresses will still have their black market and regular market uses, and will still have baseline value. 
Also notice that this is not about "taint" but about validating an address, so it is tied with an identity. Again, this may give individual bitcoins value above its baseline, but will not kill the network/protocol/economy itself.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:52:20

It may not come to pass, but there's nothing delusional about it. All the gold in the world is about $8-9 trillion. My target for Bitcoin puts it at $2-20 trillion. Meanwhile, gold is useless and difficult to secure, while Bitcoin is better gold than gold, and better digital money than fiat. I think a target of $2-20 trillion is realistic, if Bitcoin fulfills its true potential.

According to the regression of the log plot shown here:
0.1845 * exp(0.0059 * day) where day = days after July 10, 2010
Day = 1628 on 12/31/14
The price should be $2738.3 on that day.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:02:58
The way I think of it is how much has to be put in to maintain a price, given the current block reward.
At 25 bitcoins every ten minutes, * 6 per hour * 24 hours per day * 365 days per year, that's 25 * 6 * 24 * 365 = 1,314,000 bitcoins per year at the current rate.
If $20 billion was put in evenly over the course of the year and if only newly mined coins were sold (a big if, but helps as an estimate), that would be ~$15,000/coin.
Of course many people will be cashing out too (sales from the previously mined and held coins, not newly mined), but I'm not sure how to think about how that would affect the price estimate. 
EDIT: On the other hand, many miners would not be selling...so it's hard to know if the estimate should be lower or higher.

Let's not forget that very wealthy people today have much more means to scoop up coins. When bitcoin picks up more momentum they will probably be able to buy enough to be ahead of a lot of the early adopters (save the earliest biggest ones). Many stocks have gone up a thousand fold, and it didn't disrupt the state of the universe just because there were some insanely rich, insanely lucky people as result.
Also, Gavin's comment in this thread about Coase's theorem is interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:38:53
Of course it can't continue forever... 
But how much money do you think will be flowing through the Bitcoin economy one day? When people were looking for an inflation proof store of value, they moved a lot of money to gold, which increased the total value from 1.5 Trillion (not too long ago) to 9 Trillion (at its peak). But bitcoin is not just a store of value, it also can serve as a vastly more efficient means of transmitting value. I believe that these two functions support each other; assuming one day there is a high transaction volume, this will provide the "lift" and a floor for people to trust that it will retain some value. Then when that trust is built, more people might be keeping value in there as a long-term store of value, providing the floor for the transaction/transmission uses. So if 7 trillion went into gold in recent history, how much could go into this potentially history-altering new currency/financial tool/store of value?
No one knows the answer to that, and nothing is guaranteed. But to me 1 Trillion seems pretty feasible. That would put at least 2-3 more "meteoric rises" (each one meteoric relative to the previous, let's say 5-10x increase) ahead of it.

Only if you think keeping track of who owns what is a waste of resources in general. Do you believe in property? Bitcoin is a means of keeping track of who owns what via a means that is far, far more efficient than banks, and lawyers and courts. Sure, Bitcoin isn't getting rid of lawyers and courts entirely, but your argument about wasting resources applies to any system which keeps track of property. Yes, there is inherent waste in property. Perhaps we could live in a less wasteful society if we all gave up property (why do we each need a camera? we can pool our cameras and only use them when we need it! or some other such property-less system). I'm not proposing that, but I'm also not ruling it out. However, that is a necessary conclusion of your point...and it is a far more radical approach than what bitcoin is addressing. 
TL;DR it takes resources to keep track of property, and bitcoin does it far more efficiently than any system in the history of human civilization.

If you look at the long term price of bitcoin, it appears to be very closely following an exponential (with some overshoots and corrections).
See the log chart of all Mt. Gox price data: 
So while these quick overshoots seem to be tied to specific events, the underlying growth is steadily exponential. Many including myself think the growth is exponential because that is simply the growth pattern of the adoption of any fundamental new technology. So you don't need to know any specific events to predict growth like that. Bitcoin itself is the event :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:29:30
You are thinking only of large, manual, human-operated purchases. Each one of those assumptions about bitcoins use (1) large, 2) manual 3) human-operated and 4) purchases) should be in question. We may see automated micropayments as well as non-currency (think colored-coins, contracts, time-stamp validation, and other uses) transactions in widespread use on the bitcoin network one day.
As transactions increase, the cost per transaction decreases, making the larger number of transaction feasible from an economic perspective. So we might see people and agents responsible to them engaging in thousands of transactions per day..Think of micropayments, but also think of the multitude of other uses for bitcoin besides currency, which many have discussed,. If you paid one satoshi (or perhaps even less, if they increase divisibility when needed), in order to pass someone on the freeway, we can very easily see a very high number of transactions. If you throw in stock markets, property ledgers, etc, with layers on top of bitcoin like colored coins, the number of transaction may grow very high indeed. 
Think of it this way... imagine someone in 1990 argued against email by saying, look, people send on average one letter a week, so it really won't save them much time. Why would someone want to boot up their computer, connect their modem, etc, just to send a letter? But now we send/receive up to tens or hundreds per day or more. So increasing the ability will allow us to find new uses. But email is still a manual, mostly human-to-human communication medium, and antiquated at that. I think the difference between today's finance and potential with bitcoin might be orders of magnitude bigger than snail mail to email, but I use the example for illustration.
As far as technical feasibility, here is a summary of the discussion on scalability targets is estimated that can be handled on today's hardward: 
And beyond that, I think as hardware improves the sky is the limit. Listen to Gavin talk (back in 2011) refer to a million tps bitcoin future: 
Now some people cry foul, saying well if the requirements are that high, then power will be concentrated and bitcoin won't be decentralized anymore. I think that's a red herring. Centralization vs. decentralization is a false dichotomy. We don't have a problem with the Internet just because there are very large backbones. So too, large bitcoin mining operations/providers don't have to threaten the open nature of the protocol. 
Also listen to Mike Hearn discuss potential Bitcoin futures: 
Granted these sci-fi scenarios seem far away, but I think there is plenty of room to feasibly occupy every level between now and then, both from a technical feasibility and from a usage point of view.

Likewise, Ross was very proud of himself, taking on the big bad state, single-handedly winning the war on drugs and all that, on some level he unconsciously wanted to get caught so he could be recognized as a hero.
Besides the unconscious desire he probably also just wasn't very careful or smart about not getting caught.

We are in the mining phase...the money put into electricity for mining is now rewarded by getting payouts in bitcoin. Cost per transaction might not be such a meaningful way to look at it right now. What is the cost per transaction of gold?
Right now the incentives are aligned, so the cost per transaction is high, but everyone is benefiting.
Expect those economics to change as the system scales. When mining rewards diminish and Bitcoin is doing 10,000 transactions per second...or dare I dream, 100,000 or 1,000,000/sec, then the cost per transaction will be much more economical. The costs/rewards of mining, which should be roughly equal at equilibrium (with small margin of profit for miners), does not increase with greater tps. So the high cost per transaction will decrease when transactions go up.
Using your numbers of $254 per transaction, at a current rate of roughly 1 tps, if transaction rates increase to 10,000 tps, it would cost 2 cents per transaction. And if it increases to 100,000 or  1,000,000 tps, we'd see a proportionately lower cost per transaction. Of course, cost per block will probably go up too as the value of a bitcoin increases, the mining costs will increase roughly in equilibrium with the mining rewards, but that's a ball park range for you.
You say "even if the calculations are off by 100 or 1000 it's still impossible for Bitcoin to win" but you didn't calculate if it's off by a factor of 10,000 or more, which is where I believe it will level off.
Also, while many including myself argue that bitcoin may replace or largely supplant credit card payment networks, it is not a direct one-to-one competitor. Bitcoin offers many benefits in multiple areas besides cost per transaction.

Dude, so aggressive. How do you presume to know the motivations and future actions of people you've never met or seen? Is it really so unlikely that he might buy a product from a different company one day? Android is pretty nice too, it's not like he said he's getting a blackberry or something XD

Good reference... but it's not like this kid _invented_ bitcoin.
EDIT: or have we found our Satoshi...?

Just curious, why couldn't bitcoin switch to hybrid PoW/PoS like Peercoin?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:08:44
I know it's fun right? I almost never do that, but it just felt appropriate here.

What does this quote mean to you in this context?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:29:23
I agree with you, but let's not get cocky yet. Bitcoin is pretty big, doing well, and has good momentum, but it's hardly established or un-displaceable.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:07:35
So do Bitcoiners :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:41:24
I agree! In certain ways, non-validated coins are worth more...good point.

This is the most important bitcoin chart to consult: 
No chart can predict the future, but barring any major change (irreparable flaw in the protocol, attempts to ban bitcoin, credible competition, none of which have even remotely happened yet), I believe it is an informative and predictive chart. Think long-term, friends.

That's only if government requires all exchanges to only sell from validated addresses. Right now they are not requiring it. There are already AML/KYC regulations in place. So the question becomes, can the USG REQUIRE exchanges to buy and sell only from/to validated addresses? You raise a good point, if they did, it would crush the black market. But maybe that's not possible. The government doesn't forbid any currencies, they can only regulate how to buy into and out of USD. In the case of foreign currencies, there are no requirements to trace anything about it (on the foreign side). 
So maybe, hopefully, there is no legal framework/footing to require that only certain types of bitcoins can be sold, and that validated addresses would only give greater than baseline legitimacy over regular bitcoins, but not that regular bitcoins would be outright illegal.
Your concern is legitimate, but I think, I hope, we are far from that.

I actually agree with you anon515, but some people are just in the mindset of making money by actually building and creating a product. In most cases "get rich quick" is not the way to go, and there are very few opportunities in the world or in history like a new monetization event such as Bitcoin. So these guys are a) just not used to thinking that way OR b) they're doing both, buying Bitcoin and also making it more likely to succeed. Fact is, if no one is building Coinbase or similar products then Bitcoin won't see the 25000% increase you cite. SOMEONE has to do it.

He calls it MarketCoin (the exchange coin) and he also wants to make an OzCoin to represent the Australian dollar (he's Australian), similar to what you described. It would work for any other currency as well.

Why are you here? What do you find so compelling?

Thanks! Mike Hearn's talk about Bitcoin's untapped potential suggested that we might actually be able to use bitcoin to keep track of our physical property as well (and cryptographically enforce it), definitely inspired that understanding a little bit.
You can watch it from Bitcoin 2012 here:

It's not a political statement. I just prefer to own a phone that will have the function to allow me to use my bitcoins. No internet posturing here, just a personal report. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:33:48
Bitcoin is already a pretty big business.

That's a good point...bitcoin foundation should be diversifying its legal expertise with some good experts in Chinese law. The foundation shouldn't just be a western thing.

Likewise, I actually have an android phone but was thinking of switching and getting an iPhone 5S when my contract is up. Not anymore. HTC One looks pretty good to me now.

Very interesting idea. Do you have any sources for that, regarding the politics behind the Federal Reserve Act?

Yes, I think this is a very meaningful way to look at it. On the log scale the plot actually has surprisingly strong linearity, indicating exponential growth with some overshoots and corrections. It shows that the exponential growth is not just stable, it is damn predictable.

Every pump and dump has promoters who are spreading awareness about the asset, but not every asset which has people promoting it is a pump and dump.
Put another way, perhaps, you could argue it is a healthy "pump and dump". They are certainly promoting it for their own benefit, but it's a win-win and they are doing it because they believe in the product.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:04:44
I think the opposite. The speculation is actually necessary to create the lift and create the economic volume to support the volume of transactions which Bitcoin will one day process. Sure, it could do it without speculation, but I think the speculation helps. Volatility makes it more difficult, but I think overall the speculation will help.
