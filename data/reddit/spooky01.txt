What would that mean ? How are they not supporting trezor right now ?

It REALLY doesnt work that way. It makes no sense. Why would you short before dumping? You could just sell instead of shorting.

Don't be so sure. I believe in bitcoin on long term because it is fool-proof. I mean a company no-matter how big or important is at some point it will fall or be replaced or simply not be able to keep up with the competition (watch yahoo or ibm). Any failure that can be asociated with bitcoin is from something else not bitcoin itself so it will wash upon time. 
All the problems existent to bitcoin are generated by third party entities (bitfinex/mt.shit/core) which is true that they can hurt the bitcoin very bad but can not fully put it down.
Even if core one day decided to just kill bitcoin and shut it down or just mess really bad with it then the btc might even fall to 1$ but at one point someone else will become the new core and if people like it then it will become the new bitcoin.
The whole point of open-source decentralization is that in case everything goes to shit we (anyone) can just fork and let the comunity asimmilate it and vote for it with their own money.
Its really beautiful. Its the ultimate form of democracy. If you dont like something you can just upgrade it how you like it and if everyone agrees with you then you become the new main thing. If only part of people agree then you create something new that can equally live with the original (etc and eth) if no one agrees with you then your ideea is rejected.
Unlike countries and governments where you have to comply with what the (supposed) majority wants, in bitcoin you are fully free (over the long-term). 
LE : I should really stop smoking all this stuff.

Thats how kraken works lately. They are not scam and their support is good only that it takes a lot of time. I had a ticket waiting for a reply 3 weeks. In the end they replied and it was helpfull and good for me but the wait was long.

A ponzi scheme is a marketing scam-scheme in which in exchange for your money you get huge returns which are paid from new commers money. 
For example you give me 100$ and i promise you 150$ in 4 weeks. The offer is so good that after you give me the 100$ you tell all your friends and they come each with 100$ and i offer them the same promise. After your 4 weeks are over i give you your 100$ back + extra 50$ (which are paid from your friends money) and so boosting my popularity (you go tell more people about me). This keeps on and on untill one day i just run away with the money.
The reason onecoin is such a smart ponzi scheme is becuse its layered on a multi level market scheme. A multi lever market scheme is a smart way to sell a product. Avon/l'oreal etc uses it to sell beauty products. Basically someone gets you in the scheme and tells you to sell shampoo and the person who introduces you gets 10% of your sales. Also on your turn you can introduce other people and you get 10% of their sales while the one who introduced you gets 10% of your 10%.
Multi level marketing is a great and smart legitimate way to sell a product but the thing is onecoin doesnt sell anything. So u have to buy a package to get introduced in the scheme and convince others to buy the package and introduce them into the scheme in order to make profit and the people you introduced at their turn will have to convince other people to buy package to make profit and so on so forth, but the package is just a gateway into the scheme and nothing more. Its not an actual product.
Longer one coin scam scheme exists more people will lose money.

I actually met him when he was in romania. Anyone has link to his blog ?

Thats the beauty in onecoin that it is actually sustainable because it only pays people who brought other people into the scheme. So you basically get a cut of the sales you bring in. 
Its sustainable to the point the fuel goes down. When there will be no new people to scam into this there will be a huge mass of people who put money in it and got nothing out.
Unlike other ponzi schemes that work on popularity (everyone hears of my great returns so they want a piece of it) onecoin integrated the promoting into the scheme. Basically its the job of the scammed people to scam even more and thats why it makes it dangerous.
It grows exponential. I scam 10 people in order to get my profit. The 10 people scam each other 10 people to get their profit and so on untill there will be no more people to scam.

Well segwit2x doesnt solve everyone's problems ? It implements both segwith and hf so everyone gets what they want. Why would core refuse to merge ?
