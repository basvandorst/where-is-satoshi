All depends what fee you paid

So much this!

Over valued?  Only a fraction of a percent of the world pop is involved currently, lots o room to grow. No?

.... The networks themselves...  Neither have been successfully attacked.   In fact, many things have been tested on the LTC network before implementation on the BTC network

Respectfully disagree.   LTC seems to be a nice lightweight and faster complement to BTC.

Would any investor sell ALL of their $AMZN when it peaked back in September...?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:48:58
I'd say that's a pretty reasonable possibility!

So far it's been proven to be equally as secure a BlockChain as BTC's.   And yes Lightning is huge plus for BTC, however, it's still not nearly as easy to use nor as robust a network as LTC is currently.  Once opening Lightning channels and doing transactions is as easy as buttering toast, then I can justify no long using LTC as a type of "checking account".

F's 
Like another comment said, try to double spend with a much higher fee

Do not try to send it to an email... 
You send it to your cold storage wallet address

That's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see how it plays out
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:30:56
It's still up how much from the beginning of the year.....?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:10:46
All financials are transferred to the/a BlockChain. Society lives. Smile? :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:59:18
Eehhhhh. IDK if I'd take that bet ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:07:11
"crashing" lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:24
Very possible.  But we're basically back into unchartered waters

Having diversity in your portfolio is more often than not a good thing
