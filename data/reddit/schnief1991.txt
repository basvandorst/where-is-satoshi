Sounds like some MLM scheme to me

Same here! I recommended btc to a colleague once, about a year ago. Haven't talked about it since, he didn't buy back then and he still doesn't care. I don't want to be that 'I told you so' douche so I just stay quiet... I don't feel comfortable giving investment advice anyways, since I don't want people to loose money because of it!

I actually like it /s(eriously)

I'm not aware of any other solution, really... Those companies provide the service of connecting all the local networks and routing traffic to the destination network, for example your home network. Without them there would be no internet, no www and no bitcoin.
Also, the net neutrality issue is more a matter of traffic prioritization. For example the service providers could give all traffic from google or facebook priority over other traffic, if they pay a certrain amount of money to them. I think the main issue is, that people fear that it gives an unfair advantage to large corporations by doing that, since small businesses probably can't afford this. I think it's not about making the customer pay for certain services, though they might try that next.
Edit: If you think about it, you are infact already paying your ISP for the internet connection ...

The whole net neutrality thing is more about prioritization of traffic, not blocking it.

The question has already been answered, but I think it's worth mentioning that you can't really sell your coins, unless they are in the exchange already. Average transaction fee seems to be around 24USD currently:

I see. I think she confused the internet for the 'world wide web'. The internet is today often used synonymously to the world wide web. The www is actually just one application running on top of the internet, others are for example E-Mail and filesharing. Each of those apps uses its own set of protocols on top of the internet, just like bitcoin. 
WWW -&gt; HTTP, HTTPS, DNS ... 
E-Mail -&gt; SMTP, POP, IMAP ...
File sharing -&gt; FTP, SFTP, SMB, CIFS
Edit: In the OSI model, those are basically all layer 7: application layer.

The Lightning network has nothing to with that, it is a proposed solution to scaling issues, though.
Edit: To answer the question, yes it is already done with nodes on a network...that network is called the internet.

I think they are right to be suspicious! The bubble will burst eventually, not the end of the (bitcoin) world, though. There are enough people who didn't buy bitcoin just to make quick money and they will continue to use it.
If I'm wrong and it's not a bubble I'll be happy, but I feel like most people coming in now are pure speculators and they'll be the first to take profits/panic sell if the price goes down.
For my part, I don't feel comfortable buying btc at this level right now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:09
I'm pretty sure they try to build the bitcoin core protocol on top of the internet, not the other way around ... Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:58:18
You may be right that it is a first step. I just see all these people talking about the net neutrality issue like it's the last step... the end of the 'free' internet basically.
I just hope, that the market won't let this happen and if the telecom providers really start censoring the internet for their own personal profit, that another participant will enter to take over. Unless they're backed by the governments ofc, like in China apparently. At that point I'd go ahead and call them a totalitarian regime.
Edit: I guess this is the result of our capitalist society. Where there is money to be made, money will be made. Politicans are just puppets to the capitalists, they usually will do what makes them the most profit.

I've had no problems with bitcoin.de so far. How much btc was it again? I don't remember, but it was like 5€ worth of btc or so when I signed up.
From what country are you? Germany? Also, how do you know it was deleted? How long did you wait for a response?
Edit: Also, didn't you have to verify in order to get the free btc??? I thought that was a thing...
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:24:23
Do you mean using as in spending/trading? That can be done peer2peer already, without internet connection. The actual process of mining (verifying transactions) does require the internet for coordination. You could reinvent the wheel, but what's the point?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:18:48
Maybe exchanges are doing just that, who knows ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:00:59
Interesting read, thanks! I recently opened an account on Bitfinex to maybe gamble on some alts, I'll have to give that a second thought... More research has to be done for sure.

I think you're misunderstanding what the internet is. It is true, that the nodes form a decentralized network of their own. The internet is the basis for this network, though. The 'internet' basically is just a bunch of local networks connected through gateways, routers and such, which use independent protocols as a means of communication, such as IP, TCP, etc. Bitcoin protocol is just another protocol building on top of this existing infrastructure. Those protocols are desinged to be independet from each other and the carrier medium used. Google 'ISO OSI' if you want to know more.

Unless I'm unaware of any new developments, net neutrality should not be an issue at all...Worst case it may stall the network a little bit, but not shut it down. See my last reply in the other thread...
What you're talking about is not net neutrality but plain censorship, I think.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:13:36
Hmm, that's strange indeed. I just thought maybe they're not as fast with non-german support, probably less staff, idk.
I'd give it some more time though, 4 days including weekend isn't all that much imo. With the recent hype they probably got a lot to do and they seem to be very decent, I'm sure they will answer in due time.
Sucks that you can't trade right now, but from what I've heard you're not better off with most other exchanges in terms of verification time etc.
Good luck!

Well, depends on the country and bank I guess, but I have to agree ;)
