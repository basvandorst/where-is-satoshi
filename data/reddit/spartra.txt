Jump on Poloniex. There are lots of people (myself included) that will lend you the Bitcoins to short it - 
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:14:36
haha gold!

Man up and take the plunge! Once you go B you won't go back!

This is a cool project!
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:26:30
Not technical on this topic, but really enjoyed this conversation. Why not Segwit first and then Bitcoin Unlimited after if required? Definitely getting frustrated with the way sending Bitcoin is slowing down and costing more.
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:45:10
Ok I wasn't aware that it was easily reversed. Guess I will need to stick to bank, cash, bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:53:01
hahaha nailed it!
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:30:00
Yeah it does seem very similar... Amir was and is a colorful character in the Bitcoin world for sure!
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:05:24
I am sure you still have a bunch of BTC sitting in your wallets!
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:39:45
Market Cap of Bitcoin from $0 to circa $20 Bill in around 8 years. Not bad, not bad at all.

Local Bitcoins is too small a market but it can't be as bad as paypal. No recourse I believe.

@_date: 2017-02-16 07:52:14
I need my trezor ASAP! Losing a Bitcoin at $1k hurts - losing a Bitcoin at 1 Italian sports car is life-ending!
 
@_date: 2017-02-28 00:50:31
Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:02:24
Yeah they are solid.

hahaha triple digits as well! This helps - 
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:01:59
That is for Bitcoin not LTC right?
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:42:24
History favors the bold!
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:41:33
haha sneaky bastards!
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:17:00
Yeah I noticed they are registered there, but if you sign up for their mailing system (mail chimp) it doesn't show their address?
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:25:10
Definitely not a scammer, and I have also been badly burnt in the past. That is why I did not go near Bitcoin gambling sites for some time after Dicebitco.in run off with roughly 7,000 Bitcoins (nearly 9 Bitcoins of those were mine) - It was brutal. 
There are some sites that have been up for a few years now and although could run off with everyone's money tomorrow have been yielding good returns for investors.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:30:46
no lube?
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:19:38
Yeah ok that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:44:22
Bitcoin is only at 67% these days. Alt coins taking a fair junk of the market.
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:10:02
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:54:48
Wait I always thought it was Cheapoair that accepted Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:57:39
If you chose the grey color they should have them in stock. If you have to go white then you'll have to wait. They ship from Europe.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:22:33
Wonder whose address that is?!
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:34:06
That was my thought. It's going crazy...

B4B - Butt for Bitcoins, or D4D - Dick for DOGE... Might have a website coming soon! haha
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:53:06
I like the trend of where the graph is going! 
Slower than I would like but in the right direction :D
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:44:52
Have you tried here --&gt; 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:35:19
haha watch this for fun! Has me hooked -
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:06:52
Trezor for sure. Shared this already but just got mine and moved away from a paper wallet and it is awesome! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:59:19
haha me too! 
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:16:20
Bravo! This sounds like something the onecoin Nazi's need to hear. Especially this one:
"As a result they may be swayed by populist appeals to emotion carefully engineered but logically incoherent sound bites, the halo effect of a likable and socially adept speaker, and so forth."
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:38:30
How much is a lot? Local Bitcoins has always put me in good stead for under $10k amounts.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:19:07
Thanks for that :)
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:10:39
Honeybadger doesn't give a shit - 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:39:40
haha yeah I enjoyed that too!
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:23:14
You are toast until the 3 days are up. I have been in the same boat with a lot of transactions. The bitch is whether it goes back to the sending wallet or it actually gets confirmed..
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:10:50
Do you have a link to show the LTC adoption? Would like to see the details.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:04:19
I wish they were all in prison already :(
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:03:37
The not wearing shoes thing was always a bit weird.
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:32:04
Wouldn't try to get anymore?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:33:09
Just got it sorted. Many hours of frustration... Thanks again :)
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:46:49
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:29:24
Thinking that your Bitcoins (or yet to be made Bitcoins) will be worth $5000 each shortly, how would you act differently with them today?
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:40:15
To invest everything you have into Bitcoins when he did, he must have been a madman from the start. Not surprised he is being a madman again...
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:06:58
yeah doing the math calculating a future price of Bitcoin is an oxymoron.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:57:29
This is hilarious! Except you dropped onecoin in there!
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:34:55
Very very cool! I signed my first message through my Trezor today - felt like a hero :) (I am completely not technically minded).
These new features are actually going to really help with the way I manage my businesses and Bitcoins. Thanks for keeping up the great work Trezor!
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:56:30
They are coming! 
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:33:01
haha we found him! 
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:21:07
hahaha lost it reading this. Yeah it is risky as hell. Yes I did expect to get scammed by 1 site over the 12 months. Not completely there yet, so it still might happen.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:36:05
Sent you a PM! Really like what you are doing here!
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:48:20
scary shit in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:56:19
It is not designed to be solely focused on investing in casinos. It is just where I have been investing to date. Will change if I see better options for a investments that have a similar or better risk/reward in the Bitcoin space. 
I have been invested in site bankrolls for 8 months now and made over 40% return on Bitcoins. All documented here on a weekly basis - 
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:20:52
I would think the BTC Volume is right.... 35 mill is way too low on the volume side for Venezuela right now.
@_date: 2017-04-16 09:01:51
Nice to know, still so painfully far from 95%
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:59:41
haha altcoins have been killing it as of late! What did you jump into?
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:40:20
haha you should see the troll box on Poloniex! Off the charts!
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:25:13
Hope so. That and maybe as the % increase the ads being spent by you know who to promote the other alternative subside.
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:46:03
Like these types of blogs - 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:23:59
I hope LTC activating faster is a beacon for all miners to make the move and it jumps faster
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:53:41
haha that'll do then :) Was doing some last minute changes and didn't notice those errors - so thanks for that!
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:00:57
hahaha 2nd one I have fallen for today!
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:37:34
Strange of them to say that - would like to see some evidence to back it up.
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:31:21
On it... Second mistake?
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:27:31
Great movie too!
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:57:14
Cheapoair :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:53:29
I have open trades right now on Bitsquare - get on there everyone! Needs critical mass to be the killer application it will be!
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:47:46
Worth more than 7 BTC now :D 
@_date: 2017-04-16 13:55:53
What happened? I haven't yet
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:30:37
Brutal errors - should be fixed now :)
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:03:18
Giving your private keys over is pretty scary.
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:10:01
Is this an April fools joke?! Of course Bitcoin gambling is not making money - investing in the house is. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:38:12
Hint, hint. Nudge, nudge!
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:58:47
Last I looked at the graph it is back under 30% - 
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:18:05
That slight house edge with proper bankroll management (i.e only allowing a maximum win that is a tiny fraction of your bankroll) is what has kept Vegas in business and ensures whales can't take everything.
I agree with you on the scammer though, if a site screws you or can't manage the security properly then you can lose everything. Hence I wanted to interview the site owners on the site.
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:25:09
hahaha Rick Rolled
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:04:28
Once the liquidity is there the platform will be awesome! Looks like the Euro is getting there already.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:01:06
And Bitcoin Gold?
