So I'm fairly new to Bitcoin, and I would love to hear thoughts from those who know more about btc than me (probably most of you). I only recently jumped onto the hype train and I would like to hear predictions about where Bitcoin is headed in the near and far future. Looking at earlier peaks/bubbles/whatever you call them, there always seems to be a strong decline shortly after. How far do you think the value will drop? Do you think it's best to wait more weeks/months before investing? Would it be realistic to expect btc will completely fail at some point? Or would it be more realistic for it to be widely adopted? Also any links to insider articles are welcome. :) Thank you!

Looking at the last two record heights, do you think the price may correct itself to $2000,- or even lower? I'm speculating there's still a crypto bubble on the brink of bursting.

LOL. I agree though it'll probably rise to 3000 this year, but I think the dip has only just started...

That's actually an even bigger question, outside of the whole USAF/Segwit debate will we see another 2014-2015 scenario where everybody is blindly going all in when the price 'should' settle back to the 1000-1500 range.

This is a pretty interesting video (not specifically about Bitcoin):
