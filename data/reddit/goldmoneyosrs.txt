It's pretty obvious it's only downhill from here. They've indulged governments and big corporations too much for many decades with low interest rates, at the cost of higher taxation and way less decentralization of markets (less small bussiness/self employment, more big names).
It's a matter of a decade till the pension funds implode, from there it will be printing money or confiscative taxes on wealth to patch past political failures. On top of negative interest rates (confiscation of savings, etc).  From there it's downhill without brakes.
The question about confidence in the dollar will turn really bold by then. Good times ahead.

I said I'll hold 50% and the other 50% I'll try to take profits from, in the form of gold after the bull market because by then I'll expect another huge bear market like last year, so trading btc to gold back and forth between bitcoin cycles is similar to doing it so with fiat, but without any of the fiat systemic risk and without the taxation per trade.
Imagine trading a x20 for a x5.

More mining profits doesn't increase the rate of coins found, unlike natural resources. More effort directed to mining just scalates its security. The discovery rate is fixed.
It neithers makes bitcon more or less scarce. Did you even understood this?

Parabolic moves will start only after the programmed inflation halvening begins.
I'll hold half of my btc investment no matter what and take profits into gold gradualy with the other half. 20k future lows.

Im buying BTC today, and if it drops bellow 1k  in 2019  I'll use all cash to go in.
+50% in gold I cant care less about recession, I wait it.
IMO capital controls, bank deposits found (by suffering consecuences) as fake by the normies, taxation rising with a lil austerity, all that butthurt is bullish for an omnipresent unstopable network of trustless magical gold, cuz it creates a free market opportunity in a freedom declining world

Can an analyst reading the ledger overcome mixed/washed transactions to link adresses and user?
If mixed to wallet from an exhange (which got your ID), and mixed to cold storage and storage for actual spending. Its private.
BTC layer 1 requires mixing and 1 time-use keyss to avoid taxation/confiscation.
