Had this same thought today. Took my two sons to Wendy's. 27 bucks man, and one of those was a kids meal. That's some bullshit.

Why not? Is it written somewhere that Reddit is supposed to a bastion of truth? If I want truth Reddit isn't in the list of sources I use.
I think it's pretty clear that this sub is all about Bitcoin love, regardless of how connected to reality it may be.
And that's ok!

Well, I mean just because people do it doesn't change the quality of the information.
All kinds of people smoke knowing full well the health hazards.
Probably a bad analogy, but you get my drift?

All I have to do is open the Daily Discussion and the price drops.

1. I'd like to help the community and use my CPU cycles to verify transactions.
2. I have not considered these things, I'm a noob. I'll look into those, thanks.
3. Thought so.
4. I don't know what a backup seed is. EDIT: I know what this is as it relates to large computer backups but I don't know how it relates to what I'm doing with Bitcoin Core.
Thanks for your reply.

Ok thank you. Is it easy to transfer from coinbase to those?
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:30:26
I've been on Coinbase for couple maybe three months. I would like to hold my own coins. Where would I start this research you mention?

The female equivalent of a homeboy?
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:49:25
Yes definitely. Or perhaps not.

Keep this SHIT off this sub.

This is all about China, btw.

What are you guys/gals using to track your purchase vs the current price? For ex I have a spreadsheet I input the details about my purchase(s) in and then I manually put in the current price and I have another cell calculating the difference. But when I DCA a bunch of little purchases it's really time consuming. There must be a better way.

No one fucking knows dude. Don't invest more than you are comfortable losing.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:55:53
In that case you should set up rules for ex:
* Price rises x% from buy price, sell
* Price falls x% from buy price, sell

Recent pump based off MoneyGram. I got out at .45, average buy price was .39 so I'm happy for now.

How dare you assume it's a man. /s

@_date: 2019-06-03 20:55:48
I'll allow it.

In that case you should set up rules for ex:

* Price falls x% from buy price, sell

Never stop learning.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:01:03
What are you scared of?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:51:28
I keep seeing people saying they are scared that the price is rising and I really don't get it. Is it histrionics or are you honestly scared of the price dropping or something?
I kind of just want to say calm the f\* down and stop being scared of things.

Usually when we hear about news the value of a stock is already represented by the current price.
China is leveraging to become a financial superpower in the coming years. In this case the dollar will devalue and it's highly likely that people aren't going to invest in the Yen. We'll need a different form of value transfer. The volatility and price fluctuations at this time are an attempt to establish the future worth of the various forms of crypto.
All my opinion of course.
(That being said I'm having a really hard time HODL'ing XRP right now.)

I couldn't find a way to do automated buys with CBP.
