It's still incredibly helpful to have a foundation of knowledge regarding the subject so at least you know what it's all based off of. In my EE classes we learn about analog filters and the physics behind DC and AC motors. Are we ever going to build one? No, but learning about their underlying structure will help analyse similar systems even if they are far more advanced

Well when you buy you'll only receive ~$20 since transactions fees are around $5, and you probably won't receive it for a few days since transactions are backlogged due to the massive amounts of trades happening. Try looking into Litecoin if you really want to get into crypto, but like many have said; if you aren't willing to loose everything you've invested don't invest. Bitcoin is definitely not going to rise forever and those who can't recognize that are seriously going to get burned.
