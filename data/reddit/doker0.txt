Merry Christmas. What did you get? ;)

Where is the right place to advertise bitcoin business?
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:35:27
It's not true that no gov has licensed bitcoin and also that transactions are anon.
@_date: 2015-12-09 13:59:33
Non if these people is Satoshi Nakamoto.
The only real Satoshi Nakamoto is an all-knowing being from hevens that came upon us from higher dimention and gave us the greatest gift of free money to let us enter the higher vibration for the enlightenment of humanity.

Is bittrex legit?
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:31:14
Welcome to ur club.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:34:59
Thanks guys, I feel much better now :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:32:48
I know. I'm so excited. ;D
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:36:05
How many millions of dollars would be huge?
I'm a bit worried that spreads on bitcoin markets would kill all advantages of bitcoin transfer even if we're talking about Venezuela at the edge of bankruptsy
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:34:41
What about nxtty?
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:05:44
Twit the guy. Show him your support.
@_date: 2014-11-24 10:45:44
tl;dr; There's a private hospital - Medicover - in Warsaw that accepts payments in bitcoin. A couple decided to give birth in the hospital and pay for the service in bitcoins.

50% correction is something common when previous candle is so much bigger then other. If it goes to 66% then I will change my mind.
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:34:50
Oh no! Bitcoin is dead!
Time to buy guys ;&gt;
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:32:24
What is it?
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:09:53
I've never been a great trader but I've learned one thing. When there is a bottom and then the price is pulled up and then back again to for a "W" pattern... then the second leg must retrace at least 60% back down. If it goes around 50% like it was in our case then we are waiting for a stronger restest of the support. That is why I will be watching lower time frames only after the price is under $300.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:05:47
Gold must be kept in safe and you need bond to keep in wallet. These can be faked. With bitcoin the problem does not exist.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:52:52
Why do they mine more empty blocks??
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:45:47


I honestly think that bitcoin will be the main and global currency in future. You still may want to go fishing and grab a beer at some local store, or maybe you wan't to give back a few bits to the friend who ordered pizza to the party. Or maybe you're phone's dead. I like to have some real money in my pocket. (remember that I strongly believe that we will be using bitcoin on daily basis some day).
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:51:54
shoal of whales ;$
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:00:29
Well. We could actually do that. We will talk it through and gather our bitcoins and buy gold with it and then we will call it a "International Bitcoin Treasury" (IBT) and it will be a private company just like Fed. 
Profit? ;]
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:19:16
Well well Satoshi. Welcome. Hope u used Tor. So you used TeX to compose that BIP? So university scolar, huh?
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:33:51


Fine, but only dried meat
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:47:07
Ok. So when bitcoin goes to 1M, should we buy gold and establish some central reserve bank? 
@_date: 2016-01-03 22:31:02
This topic is a good lesson to me, thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:49:06
I love this "It happend and I will now tell you why" things.
I tell you, if like bitcoin as much as Buffet loves cola then invest in bitcoin and buy whenever you think it's low.

Was it bad? It helped me. Clarified a lot
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:49:15
As usual, tomorrow brings surprises. Lets wait.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:54:00
Let's to it similarly  to bitcoin's dificulty. The wider spread the slower execution in the way of moving average - 
@_date: 2016-01-04 06:58:05
troll advice.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:20:23
Don't worry. We are trying the triangle, for the last time. That was expected.
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:30:11
Conclusion: SegWit and Sidechains plus some other stuff will make 1MB block enough for ever.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:55:44
Good news for this sub and bitcoin. It's safe in PL if you need a bank.
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:51:55
Yeah right... and how do you liquidate them into fiat? If you do that you're gone shake the price.
@_date: 2016-01-29 11:14:23
Another smartass trying to correct democracy.

This apologies letter is like:
Sorry i wrote you about ETH. I just want good for ETH. I'm just ETH user. I will never again spam about ETH. I know ETH community does not want me to tell about ETH....

$4000 not much for a US c++ dev.
@_date: 2016-02-01 08:48:29
Ok so they wrote it but none of them is satoshi.
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:47:44
omg you scamer
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:22:30
Isn't that Stealtcoin exactly?
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:23:28
what is the 21mil cap discussion about?
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:23:25
Maybe you're right. Doesn't NXt client have market place?
@_date: 2015-11-09 13:04:40
Thanks. One more, what kind of majority is it? Is it mining power or what?
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:26:46
You are allowed to draw them bottom to top of any completed 5 wave series. It is really good that we have 50% absolute and 61.6% in last series. This is like.. sooo bulish
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:29:28
USD is so high now that even if it breakes the final resistance it will start falling just by reasons of technical analysis.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:18:15
Why don't you help SuperNET unity?
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:59:57
You should have told that to all these people that used their gold dollar coins years ago. So stupid people!
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:19:47
Mine was like, "cool, it happend exeactly what happend before, i'm bullish now."
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:08:32
More like in "linux"
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:05:02
Gold is dead!
You know what that means?
&lt;spoiler&gt;BUY GOLD&lt;/spoiler&gt;
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:40:45
Well yes, but this explains how it is secure. People don't need to know how is money printed. They are more interested in the fact that it is hard to counterfeit. 
And I don't agree that it completelly missess the idea of blockchain. To the contrary.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:37:47
No he did not. He put it from the bottom to top of major wave consisting of 5 minor waves.
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:37:11
Use StealthCoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:29:28


What about mozilla lunching new Tor nodes...
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:47:02
That's just one bad person.
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:57:54
I think that people don't care about it. They would if they at least got a stroke of genius for a second but they just don't thing about things like security.
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:10:44
What about other currencies on bter?
@_date: 2015-10-29 07:16:28
Fine. Let's convert run&lt;-&gt;usd&lt;-&gt;btc. No big difference
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:06:44
Did you here about UNITY? What do you think about it?
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:26:44
It's ok to have these, too. Like with one-button iPhone. Most people don't care what's under the hood. They will adopt whatever makes their life simpler. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:34:40
Why and why...
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:41:52
Except Unity, bitshares and nxt.
