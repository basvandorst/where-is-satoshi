Actually I agree with you, I’d much prefer a Tesla to a Lambo. I actually hold stock in Tesla. I was just trying to perpetuate the moonboy shtick...
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:18:19
lol, you have any idea how much $ is in bitcoin ? It literally dictates the crypto market. I know some of you guys want it to die but it probably never will because of the massive investment/trading tool that it is. Good luck with that tho, try being realistic
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:18:41
Fucking phenomenal news! Thanks to whoever put this gem together!
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:29:45
you should have fought them. With violence
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:02:41
yea man but it's not showing up in my wallet....
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:26:38
Thirsty? Try a faucet
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:13:55
Not pumping anything friend but thanks for making my point for me. Also, I'd say at least half of this community is in it to make money, not everyone is here to destroy the banks or whatever the current rallying cry is.
Disclaimer - i have purchased/traded exactly ZERO of the said "scamcoin" and don't plan on investing in it.
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:31:16
thanks for your help - so i need to contact [blockchain.com]( ?
@_date: 2019-11-15 04:25:21
Let's be completely honest though - none of us has any idea what bitcoin is going to do. You only say that it is about to tank because the price is going down, right ? Or do you have some kind of technical analysis that leads you to believe this ? let's revisit this post in two weeks....
Disclaimer - i'm not saying i know what bitcoin is going to do either, i'm just saying lets see what happens.
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:42:39
Yes it is
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:22:21
Religion is 100% self-serving and is never altruistic.
This cannot be exclusively true in all instances.
This is what I’m talking about but he states it like it’s a fact when in fact he has no clue what any one person’s motives are unless he himself is omniscient
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:05:17
its a [blockchain.com]( wallet. i copied and pasted on mobile. it's the correct address
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:02:49
Man you’re asking random dude on the internet but IMO it’s closer to digital gold. But wtf do I know?
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:56:42
No one said anything about fake entities or you doing shitty in life. I said you had a shitty view on life. I’m not concerned with your morals only the fact that you presume to know everyone’s motives when really you don’t know shit. Same as me
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:16:36
All great points although i never accused you personally of name calling. IDK who's buying it but it is pumping. I'll discontinue the conversation about it though before i get reported. Bitcoin is king and everything else is trash scam shitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:25:40
Don't be a bunch of pussies boys ! Get in there and lets get us some fucking lambos
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:47:13
yea i'm fine with that. Expected it earlier. Love the community here
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:17:11
Nah man I didn’t imply anything about your shitty view being damaging or that you needed anything. That’s the way you took it. You presume to know everyone’s motives when you make statements like you did above about religions being 100% anything. You stated your opinions as facts - like why people participate in religion. You don’t know why people choose to participate in religion, do you?
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:37:21
just waiting for the dip...
@_date: 2019-11-10 20:06:53
Not everything always works “as intended”, sometimes we find better (or more profitable) uses
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:45:17
So no making guesses at a bottom in this subreddit ?
my bad bro - how about this - i think we are in a market cycle. I think the price will continue to go down further before it goes back up again. like a cycle. is that vaguely concise enough ?
Edit : btw, it wasn't actually a forecast, just a guess of what the bottom could be using the lows from last year. 
Disclaimer : i'm not forecasting shit
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:58:56
no problem man you may have a few more dips you can buy soon !
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:33:45
what the hell is this crap ?

Never used it but I heard the fees/markup are pretty high
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:06:48
I honestly converted all my DAI back to btc when schiff sent that tweet. Didn’t really catch the bottom but got back in around 8400. Feels good man
@_date: 2019-11-09 06:00:49
Why do you say that ?
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:34:07
just do what he says already
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:40:50
thanks for your contribution. hope this quality post makes you feel smarter
@_date: 2019-11-15 05:56:47
We shall see
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:11:17
I've been saying i think we are just in the middle of a natural market cycle....probably swing down around $3000 then start over again. Look at the macro...
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:35:49
I’m not confused maybe I just didn’t phrase it correctly. I have a coinbase account, a cold wallet, a blockchain.com wallet, bottle pay, as well as a coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:06:11
Bovada. They have a guaranteed price on deposits that lasts 15 minutes. Great if you can catch it during a dump (which I did last week)

I've used it before to buy some TRX - worked fine for me as long as you don't mind the transaction fees

Wow, that really touched a nerve. That not getting any pussy comment sounds like it was right on point. Good luck with that friend

i don't like the n- word...
@_date: 2019-11-10 20:04:09
Bitcoin will likely never be THE global currency because of its volatility. A stablecoin would be much better suited to fit this need. Just consider what makes more sense.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:05:24
Gentlemen - am i the only one who believes that we are just in the middle of a full blown market cycle ? This seems natural to me after the run we had earlier this year. Look at the macro. We cycle back down to around $3000 then start over again. I'm truly perplexed that there has been bullish sentiment with the overall direction of the trend over the last few months. It just seems obvious to me where this is headed. But then again i don't know shit so take it for what its worth.
Edit : downvoted for bearish sentiment. love it. Nothing but fucking moonboys here. no one is realistic. Disclaimer - i'm invested in BTC as a long term investment and i'm HDOLING

@_date: 2019-11-14 06:51:48
Lol I never said I was one of those people bro, you got it fucked up putting words in my mouth. No ones upset about my friend’s views. And to satisfy your question- I don’t affiliate politically. No, I wouldn’t call myself liberal. I don’t really care about dude’s opinions I just don’t care for the fact that he’s an arrogant asshole that knows everything. How the fuck you know that everyone is selfish and no one is altruistic? You don’t because you don’t know what those people think. Dude only knows the fucked up view he has on life.
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:00:51
Wouldn’t some “religious thing” most likely be altruistic?
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:10:45

@_date: 2019-11-12 03:45:51
I actually think dude was asking a question, not whining. You must not get much pussy or something because you come across as an arrogant asshole. Just because you know everything there is to know about crypto doesn’t mean everyone else does. Try just being helpful sometimes.
@_date: 2019-11-12 22:13:21
Thx for all the options friend!
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:15:23
i thought forecasting was frowned upon here. i got downvoted the other day for saying i thought it would hit the 3000ish region.
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:05:05
Thanks schitff!
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:25:22
Bro you got a shitty view on life. Good luck with that. Believe it or not there are people out there without self serving motives. Just because you see things a certain way doesn’t make it true. But I already know you, no one can tell you shit because you know everything already. Who hurt you anyway?
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:12:10

Im just some idiot in the internet but I would think that a stable coin - like DAI - would be much more likely to be a country’s main currency. No doubt this is what Zuckerberg was aiming for with Libra
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:29:06
Sorry for you, i was on the other side of that game last night. Personally I feel like i have a WAY better idea of how a given NFL game will go than where bitcoin will go.  You're talking about two different things here anyway - Hodling is investing. Trading would be more akin to gambling. What you did is tantamount to withdrawing money from your savings or retirement and going to the sports book/casino. I would't assume to tell anyone to do with their money though
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:46:52
Tbh that’s all I’ve heard everywhere (along with a short squeeze)
I do appreciate the summary tho as I wasn’t gonna watch but was curious
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:01:52
Doesn’t mean they wouldn’t do it. In fact that makes me think just the opposite, that they might do it for that very reason...
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:11:34
Ok friend, I’ll give it a watch just for you
@_date: 2019-10-31 01:16:37
I doubt Bitcoin will replace the dollar. If any cryto were to do so it would likely be a stablecoin like DAI, USDT, or PAX.
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:01:41
Probably headed to $8900 before it can make another run up. I’d give it 2-3 weeks
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:53:25
China already has it they just won’t announce it lol
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:10:21
So does the rest of the world unfortunately I think it’s inevitable. China is always one step ahead. Trump should take notes
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:53:17
This is fucking amazing ! Gave you a follow as i can't wait to see what's next !
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:04:02
I would say yes it’s “safe” but if you truly want to own your bitcoin you better find an exchange. I started with coinbase (good for noobs) but am now considering switching to Kraken
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:05:07
So the IRS is actually calling it a *currency*....

How does one hodl?
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:40:12
The dollar isn’t tied to anything now so what makes you think they’d need a stablecoin to be tied to anything? I was just giving examples of stable coins anyway. The US would likely mint their own stable coin so they could control it
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:14:31

Holy shit. If I was Bulgaria’s tech guy I’d have said it’s more like 200
@_date: 2019-10-31 04:56:32
sorry man you win. Call it whatever you want. My point is that the US wouldn't use bitcoin as a national currency. The would use some kind of magical digital internet money dollar fiat currency coin backed by nothing presumably.
@_date: 2019-10-31 05:12:16
Let me ask you this - who is using bitcoin as a currency these days ? Degenerate online gamblers ? Do you "spend" your bitcoin ? Because i'd be willing to bet most people don't. Most everyone here either hodls or trades it on the market...then exchanges it for fiat. Bitcoin will NEVER be a national currency.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:21:10
very informative thank you for your contribution
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:54:12
just the twitter propaganda the binance spreads. that and the fact that he fucks these ICO holders out of their money then lies and says there's no suspicious activity.

minimal interference ? like the MATIC debacle that he basically created and fucked all those bag holders ? or did you see the tweet posted above - copy and paste bullshit. people are blindly loyal to this piece of shit.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:12:36
i think what you are doing here is called making a blanket statement. also, here's something to think about when you say no practical use : the gambling industry is second only to porn. what do you think everyone is gambling online with these days ? I use it every day.
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:00:41
Bitscoin lol
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:35:59
exactly - ppl worship this dude but really he's a piece of shit. Needs to be a decentralized platform not made by some shifty mother fucker that manipulates tokens and has millions of twitter shills that just spread propaganda
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:31:18
