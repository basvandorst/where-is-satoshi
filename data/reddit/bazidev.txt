mining will stop after production all the 50million BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:21:38
 so what do other miners do if someone get the 51% power . i think this was close to happend in 2011
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:15:22
so difficulty level were programmed to be Increased and decreased ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:03:54
how could anyone know if they're already doing this or no, anyway ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:16:38
so he get the reward and more people can get the same reward if they all find the valid number before 10min ends ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:44:37
the first transaction was 50btc . this was the reward for mining then?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:27:43
so how the first bitcoin unite saw light ? by mining ?

i found it hard first time , now i have more clear informations . am not a native speaker but i will try again :)
one last thing . do miners while mining goes to the earlier blocks to see if someone who is making a transaction actually have the amount he wants to transact ?
and another one , and i hope it be the last . if someone want to change the blockchain , he have to mine all the next chains after the one he change again . and mine them all in a short  time so he can join miners in the current block. witch is impossible . and this is way block-chains are safe ? and even he succeed in catching them , they will refuse his block because of the strange hash right ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:41:39
what if not everyone agrees that this was the first ? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:34:43
this transaction is always the last in the block ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:49:57
 i know that the first come to complete(solve) the block get the reward . so if all the other miners adds them own first transaction , it won't be saved if someone else solve it before ? right ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:53:52
as far as i know mining is to solve some hard operations to save the next block in the block-chain ? right ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:06:15
they may just invest some of money and experience in mining , they will gain a lot and keep their reputation !
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:47:14
now it's only 12.5 and mining become hard right ? how does it become hard ? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:19:02
but the reward transaction is the first one in every block . and it's divided by 4 every year . it will be measured before all transactions in the block done ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:04:31
do you now any uptodate website or tool , where i can know how much satoshi i can get with a specific amount of dollars . 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:28:38
any link or example how the number miners should find looks like ? in different different  levels .
or how it's long ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:39:16
so bitcoin system is designed to make it 10min in average by changing difficulty every 2weeks ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:52:23
actually , i did google it after posting the question . and i found a lot of tools !
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:23:50
so everyone accept that the block valid was found pass to the next one to solve ? and who refuse stay in the prev one and so one . he is losing energy while others are solving next blocks .
the rule of proof of work compare chain from time to time to see witch one is longer or what ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:06:52
what if he find the valid number before 10min ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:22:54
so mining started before transactions ? and you can still mine even if there is no transactions ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:42:31
cpu usage is already high when using chrome !
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:58:08
yes , but using devices cpus . a small amount of cpu would be enought . cauz there is 2billion device powered by google android . and millions of visits per day to google websites and apps .
