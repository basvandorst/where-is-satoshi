Anyone else getting tired of this b******* like Bitcoin only has value because you guys are assigning it value. That's basic economics. I don't see it replacing any standardized currency anytime soon and I'm getting tired of people saying we're so lucky by the dip. Like no how about I pay my rent and watch Bitcoin crash and burn.

You can't make gold from nothing.

I'm fairly certain the bottom is 0 when it's ultimately worthless which it eventually will be
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:02:56
when Bitcoin inevitably drops to zero value it's going to be interesting to see all the stories from all the people that lost their ass investing everything they had in it. But I hope it works out for you.

Pretty sure the websites receiving the good old Reddit DDOS of Doom
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:59:00
Why is this so far up my Reddit stream? I swear Bitcoin post are becoming like those little things that swim up your urethra when you pee in the Amazon.

And therein lies its intrinsic value. Something that could be worth nothing tomorrow is not a stable investment. Although I do appreciate your comment you are right my problem is with the value.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:56:53
I swear people in this subreddit don't want to hear anything bad about Bitcoin but it's not a replacement for banks or traditional Investments it can't even recover from the massive crash that was largely an inside job. How am I supposed to believe it's a replacement let alone is safe replacement for my bank account or for conventional Investments like gold or silver. I just don't get it I see these post all the time and it's like it hasn't gone over 9k in months. I'm not trying to be a troll or anything but come on people.

3.79 million Bitcoin are already destroyed. no more Bitcoin can be created. That means anywhere from 17 to 23% of the coin is already completely destroyed. On top of that you also have people dumping and pumping the cryptocurrency lowering its value. At some point it coins going to be worth nothing. And I just hate for it to be promoted is this amazing thing that's supposed to replace the dollar. It has no value accept what people give it it isn't backed by any Central Authority and while that is appealing to some that also me and said it's largely unstable and open to corruption. I'm not saying that coin is worthless obviously it has potential I just think that people are going to ruin it.
