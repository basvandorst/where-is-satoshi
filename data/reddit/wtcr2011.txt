Sorry, the coupon will only apply to those who purchased before the price drop.  I will edit that post,  it is for anyone who purchased before July 27th, 2013 at retail price.

I think it died though.

Don't worry about the price drop, we're going to extend this very same coupon to all of our customers (*who purchased before July 27th, 2013*), the price is unconfirmed but it will be the cheapest rate possible.  
We are going to know in the next day or so exactly how much we can offer them at.  
Thanks for the patronage, it's appreciated!

Thanks, we have been a very reliable reseller and wouldn't pre-order a product unless we know it is in the pipeline and will be released shortly.  
We are 99% sure it is 130nm technology.  If a 10 GH/s blade consumes about 81 watts, and this is about 96 130nm chips, then you're looking at about 243 watts before overclocking.

Split the money up into separate wallets/addresses, make backup copies of your wallets to CD-Rs, extract your privkeys and put them on paper, make 2 copies of everything and keep them in a safe at 2 locations.  That's pretty secure.
