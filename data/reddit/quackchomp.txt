Are we talking wallets not including offline storage wallets? Id personally recommend offline storage as the only method as it really is the safest way to keep your wallet to yourself. I dont trust leaving mine on my computer or anything like that. But i got mine awhile ago with CryoBit when they were just starting up and its been 3 years annd it still looks brand new

I made the choice 3 years ago but havent looked back since.  is where i got mine because they mentioned how indestructible it was, plus the actual card is quite light and looks nice as fuck (i got the black card). They were very fast with me and ive gotten everyone i know to order theres and have never had a problem so i would trust it

Offline storage is the move. Im so glad i went with CryoBit a few years ago and been able to keep my wallet offline for all this time. Plus the cards are sleek not ugly so i like to stare at it while i watch these prices rise lol

Yeah of course, they go into more detail on the site when you click on any of the cards and scroll to “description”. Also idk if this is helpful to you but when i got mine I didnt have an encrypted wallet so their website had (still has I believe unless theres a bug) a plugin to bitaddress so you can generate an encrypted one

I get asked this whenever i talk about offline storage and mention them but its a good question to ask. They require you to use an encrypted private key (BIP-38) when ordering the card for your own protection, which means they cant know it without your personal password. They wont accept an unencrypted key when you order. According to their FAQ the address is stored for up to 10 days but I personally contacted them with the order number and they took it off the same day. They’ve been up and running since 2013/14, never seen an issue with them in terms of this. Hope that helps!

If you dont already have an encrypted key and wallet you can have one generated on bitaddress.org . For cryobit they require it to be encrypted or you cant complete the order. Adds security for the buyer which i liked. You can store unlimited amounts of one type of coin per card. For an example mine is for bitcoin, i also have an additional one for Litecoin (hardly ever use but i got it a while back). When i ordered mine i got like 8 people and they give you a discount for bulk orders. Does that answer your questions?

Yeah except this is made from a stronger metal that is much more resistant to damage than normal stainless steel. And yeah you could definitely write it on a piece of paper, but easy to lose and would wear easily wherever you store it. Basically an indestructible version of putting it on a piece of paper
