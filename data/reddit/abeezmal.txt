Here's the blurb about fees from [their T&amp;Cs:](




Xapo reserves the right to charge additional fees or to change the amount of fees, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such change.
If you don't hold your btc in their vault to use their card, why would you use their service at all? Sounds like this isn't a premium service but rather required.

Is there court precedence for this defense, specifically in regards to any kind of money/good transactions that can be successfully and surely stated in court? Please cite.

Can someone explain how this article makes any sense? Bitcoin  can't just be mined so as to be anyone's sole currency.  You still need to purchase btc equivalent in whatever currency is accepted at the time.  If cryptography is where the "money" is, how could you apply the existing model so as to replace fiat money? Makes no sense to me at all.

Wow.  So your beef is with the intensity of the white paper? Dude, it's in the sunlight and who knows what exposure settings the camera is at.  Look at the other white sheets of paper, put your foil away.

That's always his goal.  Also if anything smells of anti-keynsian, he will attack it.  
It's funny how he says this:


I don't think he himself understands that he's pointing out two distinctions, 1. Medium of Exchange 2. Reliable Store of value.  So he's asking these "smart technologists" why they like btc, and they cite reasons relating to the buying/selling of goods, yet he interprets their answers as if he's asking them about BTC as an investment medium.   Then he goes on to say that he wishes they knew the difference.  Krugman: Maybe they ARE telling you why it's great and you don't realize it.   
I also enjoy how he includes the quote:


As if these aren't his exact reasons for disliking btc., give me a break look at the goddamn title of the article. He always does the same shit in his articles: takes some stupid stance, blame others for not agreeing with him, remove foot from mouth.

Yes but that doesn't offer any kind of explanation.  The person you are bartering with still has to obtain it from someone with fiat money.
