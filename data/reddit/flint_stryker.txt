I'm guessing the reason for that is people are getting ready to transfer everything to an exchange that deals in fiat. For that you need ETH, not BTC.

In low liquidity during a crash it could absolutely happen, but it wouldn't be a real reflection of market value.

Everyone wishes they'd had a bid or two in at price levels like these at some point. I still kick myself for not having one on GDAX ETH. A hundred dollars could have turned into hundreds of thousands in mere minutes, and I watched it happen.

ETH would certainly go down with it, and probably much harder for a short period of time. When that happens I'm mortgaging the house and kids to buy all the ETH I can.

Last paragraph is very naive.
"While having different technologies is extremely good for the space, because of the competition, we can't have in fighting and especially not attacks on competing coins. The leaders of blockchain coins need to get along in order to reach our goal."

Can someone help me understand this: If I send my 10 friends each a payment, will that not be 10 on-chain transactions in the end? How will my friends ever get their BTC otherwise?

That may be true of Bitcoin, but my loyalty isn't to a particular flavor of crypto. We all know where this space is headed eventually, and we all know the last few months of price action have been extremely premature. A giant reset of the entire space would be a huge opportunity if you're not in a hurry to get rich.

I'm up 20% since October. Am I doing this right?

Dude. I still use a flip phone. They're simple, small, durable, cheap, etc. etc.

Please ELI5: how do you decide who the real Bitcoin is if more than one chain claims to be the real Bitcoin? And wasn't this inevitable?

I'll be the sourpuss who suggests that paying off the entirety of your kids' debt may not have been the best thing for them. I strongly believe in letting children (adults or otherwise) deal with the consequences of their actions, within reason. $15,000 of debt is not unreasonable for a young adult to deal with.

What will cause 300 million people to want bitcoin so badly? Need or greed?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:17:22
I'm cautious about it right now, but long term I keep thinking about these 2 things:
1. Bitcoin will exist for the rest of human history
2. Very few people will ever own 1 BTC

Dunno, or maybe you had to be an egocentric imbecile to be an early adopter?

I'm intrigued by the idea of non-geographic citizenship, but when it comes down to it, the guys in your neighborhood who carry the biggest guns are the people who decide how well you'll sleep tonight. You'll need a crypto-militia in place followed by a couple of large government collapses before you can begin to think about a world governed through a network of blockchain organizations.
