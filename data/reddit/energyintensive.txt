So for the retail investor, would you say stop loss orders (and at what% sell on long position) are critical? The volatility often makes it seem like I would lose out on gains with stop loss orders as well since many buying waves are preceded by a dip.
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:54:42
Is all of this movement really all whales or is it simply a large number of stop loss orders coupled with the usual panic selling? The proof is in the pudding and I guess in the end it doesn’t really matter.  Most of the details will get lost in the big pictur I Imagine.  I look at this over a 10 yr time frame and overall fundamentals and feel ok with a buy and hold approach. I have gotten more with dips this year and average now around 7k. I feel comfortable with the downside to upside risk/benefit ratio here as a long. I fear my guessing (aka technical trading) skills would probably lead to more selling but I doubt that I would be on board for the big logarithmic gains then... and that’s all that really matters.  Who is going to have their life changed with +/-20% at this point.  For that sort of range, stocks are probably safer and more consistently valued, and provide low tax divdends to boot.
If it goes to “zero” and I lose my shirt, I won’t be happy but at the same time that’s why I haven’t quit my day job...

I may never sell.  The long range view makes me favor security over +/- a few bucks.  If it moons, no selling then either, just borrow with the few btc to fiat lending banks that are coming out. No way i’ll be paying taxes on gains if I never sell.  Paying taxes is for idiots... don’t ever sell.

Machine learning would find uses for quantum computing that we wouldn’t. A true GAI superintelligence within a week would end up being smarter than everyone there ever was. Figuring out use cases for quantum computing would be just one of its capabilities. In either case we would be either screwed or in a zoo by that point. Or maybe the ai couldnt care less about us in its mind that works at relativistic speed. I shudder to think at the data persistence an ai that keeps its storage on computers as blockchain nodes or something...

A lot of you guys are underplaying the demand for an etf option for our stock acct investing.  Being able to easily use funds in my IRA and moving to bitcoin will most defintely be something that I would look for.  Tax benefits, long term growth potential, and ease of purchase/sale, custody, and insured against theft perhaps.  What’s not to like?  I trust a big operation like fidelity over coinbase any day from the perspective of liquidity as well.  ETF by its very nature helps the retail HODL’er, especially when they allow small size investments.

Gold is matter based currency and bitcoin is an energy based currency. E=mc^2 so more or less that is all there really is.  I suppose it is possible to crack the public key as I understand it with quantum computing. I’m not sure how existing bitcoin will end up dealing with this issue. Gold on the other hand requires serious celestial events to produce (interesting theories on this actually). Gold may be rare in general, not just on Earth. While I am uncovinced (FUD?) that bitcoin will still be prominent 50 years from now, in the short run there is no comparable network effect. Personally long btc.

There isn’t a simple solution for our monetary system as it stands.  The option to have a long term deflationary currency in the mix can be very helpful.  It will cause governments to eventually think twice about their currencies because why would you want ANY normal currency for storage in the future?  I suspect the mere existence of a widely available deflationary asset (bitcoin or otherwise) will impact the world governments.

This isnt that wrong about hindus or buddhists but from a strict genetic point of view we don’t have the 100 iq average that many white and east asian populations take for granted. The caste system in india has been a systematic breeding program for 1000’s of year. It is not that easy to punch above your weight class when entire sections of the civilizations were bred for non-intelligence traits (labor/subservience) and other like religious class and leadership class have dramatically different intellect and alpha personalities.

Healthcare ...  most of the damage done is to ourselves.  Walk with me in a hospital any day of the year and I’ll show you. We know lots of ways to stay healthy and MOST meds for MOST people are cheap as dirt now compared to what they were.
The breathtaking magitude of self abuse related hospital admissions and deaths is a sight to behold.
It is delusional to think that our health problems are solved with money when medication compliance rate (for those that can afford it) runs around 20-30% on a good day.
Banning stuff is pointless since humans don’t work that way.  Live free and die free, just dont assume that you will live as long while freely destroying your body.
I don’t like paying higher for the endless mischief of others...
Healthcare cost is high because gov. Is too involved.  Stop ALL medical regulation and make it cash for service and it will be ULTRA cheap like it is in asia now.  Let the markets decide what hospitals and doctors “survive” instead of creating a medical regulatory state where all manner of crappy doctors can hide in plain sight while the beurocrats, lawyers, and insurance companies siphon off all the money.
Go look up the price of a laproscopic appendectomy in India today or a plain chest x-ray and see what I mean.  The quality difference for either procedure is inconsequential.

Prior highs and prior descending triangles/channels and their breakouts.  The technically traded aspect of btc leads to large movements after breakout lines (either up or down). Halvenings are fundamental and price action follows technical trading behavior. Timing with bitcoin is not pure chance. The truth is irrelevant.

Eliminate federal taxation. State and local level is better.  It provides for a more adaptable system that is less susceptible to extreme crashes. Simple lessons from evolution, the biggest are not the most successful organisms on the planet. The common defense is the ONLY main reason for federal taxation. Every other plan will lead to the debasement of the civilization until we are ended. It always happens with certainty. KYC is the leaat of our “problems”. Centralization and complexity are the greater elephants in the room that are generally civilization ending.

The socialists on this thread make me want more btc...   they are a validation that war and chaos is inevitable. It always ends in shame and death. The socialist death cult will get everyone a free colonoscopy at the expense of your individual liberty.  You are only a resource shock away from house of cards collapse... after which they start their nonsense all over again. How many 100s of millions must die for this nonsense.  Socialism ALWAYS degrades into tyranny as you will never get concensus from libertarians and the right. Haidt’s work shows that there is a nearly fixed percentage of each political/social phenotype around the world and therefore war and chaos becomes an inevitability. His most recent work showing that unlike the right and the libertarian who can “understand” the philosophy of the left, the left can’t “understand” the philosophy of anyone but the left.  This impasse means that communism and war is an inevitable outcome of socialists/socialism.

I dont disagree that the expectations far outreach what is possible today but i also am certain we are far underestimating the implications in the long run.   Evolution got us a functioning brain as we have one today through some combination of trial and error.  Recursive self programming computers have no scientific reason not to do the same. If biology can do consciousness, it has already been proven to work.  We are but a blink of an eye in terms of time.  Even if it took a hundred years, the dangers and implications are still imminent.  It only took about a 200k years to get from monkey to human...

Naive about what and bootlicking whose boots exactly? Naive is the assumtion that survival of the fittest isn’t a real phrnomenon.  The right believes in it via capitalism and the left believes it via darwinism.  There is no calculation where my statements come out wrong. Even a civilization of predesigned robots wouldn’t be equal for all tasks in all environments. I’m sure you can design a society for me where income equality is better because you are more of a genius than 5 billion years of trial and error. I’m sure all of society will be right on board with you when your solution is created...

We have the least poverty and the longest global lifespan in human history. Even war is minimal now as a proportion to past times. You have all the information you need to be successful in life right on your phone...  I’d say its pretty equal already. Unfortunately IQ inequality, motivation inequality, etc.  are never going to be equal.
I have a hard time understanding why anyone would think it’s possible to gain “wealth equality”. What would that even look like? Who should my wealth be equal to in order for me to be satisfied?

Every country on earth is filled with “corrupt” governments.  I still haven’t found a solution to the corruption problem either. It is part of the nature of sentience.  One person’s corruption is another person’s loophole. You can’t design robots that won’t exhibit “corruption” either.  It’s all relative and as long as lifespans and technical wonders keep increasing, whats the difference anyway? Who is to say what system or money in the hands of who will lead to the “best outcome” - whatever that may be.
As a scientist, I would say that the human race doesn’t even have a firm grip on what a “good outcome” is for 50 years from now much less a 1000 years. We can’t see the future which is evolution simply retains variety and adaptability in biologic systems.
I believe the income equality most people seek by force actually doesn’t actually work since that equality is predicated on a constantly changing environment (resource scarcity, mass disasters or disease, dramatic changes in technology making people rich suddenly or poor suddenly).
Over engineering governments and trying to solve all ptoblems through regulations and force may actually be a lot slower than natural selection taking its course... particularly when it comes to time frames over thousands of years.
There is no one shoe fits all solution but I do know that the western world (even with all the wars and maybe) ushered forth a world where even the most poor would be pissed if they didn’t have a cellphone. Rickshaw bicycle drivers in India have smartphones (for cheap) that all the kings on earth didnt have a 100 years ago.
The world will never be “perfect” and this is why evolution is the only way for life to proceed. Adaptation and death is the natural order of things unfortunately.
The paradox of economics in my view: right wing don’t beleive in evolution but beleive in capitalism (survival of the fittest) and the left wing doesn’t beleive it applies to them (there are merit and aptitude based consequences to your quality of life). The libertarians just sorta roll with the punches.
I don’t think being naive is the problem. I think we are looking for “solutions” that will make you perhaps feel better but won’t solve the things you are trying to solve.
If you gave everyone a $1000 bucks, the smart, the producers, the corrupt, the nepotists, whatever... will always accumulate that back.

Also I would point out that most people actually don’t understand the human brain and think it is as spooky as quantum computers.  While some may not understand computers, many don’t get that the brain is a network with biological and chemical wiring.  From the earliest light sensing organisms to the human brain, these are being understood better and better every day. Consciousness may not be as hard to achieve as it is made out to be with the appropriate neural network style algorithms.  The key is to have a self learning system that can reactive to future unknowns while being able to replicate the past environmental knows.  The sun comes up every day, so the brain has a system for that that is passed on from generation to generation.  Every human is not a complete reinventiom. We are not as unique as we might seem, we all behave like earthlings.

Nobody know how long the bear market will last. Assuming it will be much longer is just guessing...   a positive black swan catalyst event or a new bitcoin use case would be more likely to create the big moves up. If a country is currently accumulating, that would be a major driving force for an event in the future.  Somehow I suspect that black ops operations worldwide are already mining coins for illicit government operations as a hedge against budget issues. I am curious how much the intelligence forces are already involved.  I see these groups as less likely to buy bitcoin and more likely to mine it for anonymity.
