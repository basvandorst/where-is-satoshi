The idea is that people will overall have more wealth without government as we know it, then paying for roads where they're needed won't be as much of an obstacle.  Not saying I agree, but that's the argument.

Anarchism and capitalism are antithetical, but there's still a lot ancaps and anarchists can agree on.  Excluding those anarchists that support a specific form of currency or oppose any currency at all (I find the latter to be foolishly naive), bitcoin would meet the needs of an anarchist society.
The key difference between ancaps and anarchists is about private property.  The vast majority of anarchists draw a distinction between private property and personal property, the former refers to productive resources which require many people to utilize (farmland, factories, mines, etc.) while the latter refers to personal possessions (gardens, homes, cars, etc.).  Anarchists claim that the right to private property is an oppressive fiction, while ancaps claim that it is just for an individual to hold sole ownership and control over a factory (or some other analogue).
Ancaps would undoubtedly support a currency such as bitcoin, but anarchists should as well.  A currency is like a language, it helps people coordinate and cooperate but just like a language it can be used to oppress people.  (Usage of words like fag and pussy as an insult are oppressive, as is using poor as a synonym for foolish).  Unfortunately many anarchists have mistakenly concluded that the oppressive qualities of modern fiat currencies are inherent qualities of all monetary mediums of exchange.  They might advocate a moneyless society or one with a medium of exchange such as labor credits, but such a society would not be sustainable above a certain size.  needs civil minded discussion about currency in a stateless society, hence why it is waiting for you :)

Putting them in jail would be a waste of resources.  These people have demonstrated themselves to be psychopathically self interested and are too dangerous to be allowed within our society.
We should bring back ostracism and public humiliation as retribution for harm done.  Inexpensive, effective, and avoids the moral debate about execution.

Would it be feasible to allow everyday users to store small segments of the blockchain instead of the whole thing?  People could still download the entire blockchain if they wanted, but do they really need to possess verification of last year's transactions?  Even a large block size would be acceptable if users could choose to only have copies of a few month's transactions.

Not that there aren't people who have that motive, but aren't there far more effective ways to undermine bitcoin?  I'd think that they'd go about it a little smarter, especially if they're going so far as to hire shills.
Though on second thought, this is probably just a bot and costs almost nothing, so even if it was relatively ineffective it would still be cost efficient.

Not quite, the people on the board of governors might not be bankers but the board of directors for each branch is packed with bankers and CEOs.
Here's who's on the board of the New York branch:

I believe currency is an invaluable tool and as such don't subscribe to the no-more-money school of thought, but there is some logic to it.  
Having a universal standard of value is deceptive in that different kinds of value are measured the same way. For example, the value of piece of artwork is determined by the same metric as the value of a car.  Lets assume that the materials and labor for the piece of artwork are equal to that of a car.  The cost of production is the same but you'd be hard pressed to claim that the value of a piece of quality artwork is equal to that of a car, beyond the monetary costs of the materials and labor.  So then the monetary value of each is determined by supply and demand, but even a piece of artwork that is under appreciated in contemporary times loses no value if people have not yet had time to understand it.
Consider also how a human life can be measured in monetary terms.  Just the thought of that should be repulsive but it is not far from the truth.  In a hypothetical just economy, where productive merit alone determines wealth, the well being and happiness of any given person is contingent upon their ability to bring in a monetary income.  If they could not earn money (maybe they are severely handicapped) then their monetary worth would be almost nothing.  Many people would call this person worthless and view them with disdain.  Yet there is some intrinsic value in a human life, independent of economic capacities.  If we measure worth by some universal metric that applies to a piece of steel just as easily as a person, then how many tons of  steel is one human life worth?
What about the value of a doctor or a teacher vs a baseball player?  Or an MRI machine vs a Ferrari?  Cosmetic surgery research vs vaccine research?  Each of these comparisons has a different kind of value but we (as a society) measure them according to the same standard.  
There are some serious ethical contradictions with a universal standard of value.  Things or activities that should be greatly valued are seriously undervalued, or vice versa, simply due to supply and demand.
Some people see this and say that we should just avoid currency altogether, which is an overreaction but it stems from the recognition of a very real ethical problem.

I agree with you that many charities squander money or outright hoard it and that just reinforces the truth that blindly throwing money at a problem won't solve it.  On a similar vein, if one does donate to a charity then it's important to choose what you believe to be the best use of your money.  If someone simply donates blindly that indicates to me that charity to them is just a feel good gesture.
That being said, I firmly believe that we have a moral obligation to share our resources with those who are in need.  The fact that there will always be negative consequences to human actions does not negate the fact that we can greatly lessen the suffering of others at a negligible cost to ourselves.  $10 a month is probably trivial to most of the people reading this but that could easily make a life and death difference to someone who can be reached by a charity organization.  Whether that directly goes towards food and shelter or helps fund efforts to combat disease, an amount of money so trivial as to not even count as a sacrifice can literally save lives.  If you can save a life at no cost to your happiness or well being then I believe you have a moral obligation to do so.
Come to think of it, cryptocurrencies might be an effective way to ensure that charitable donations are actually used as they should be.  Being able to track the money through the blockchain would allow for the kind of transparency that charity organization should have.  (I know that there are charities that accept bitcoin but I haven't looked into any of them.)  The need for intermediaries could be greatly reduced, increasing the portion of donations that actually go towards the services vs the expenses of running the charity.  I think if people had greater confidence that the money they donate is used in the way that they want it to be used then many more people would donate.  Cryptocurrencies could make a huge difference in that regard and better enable human generosity.

What? No, those are false and hideously oversimplified equivalencies.  Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, that is necessary for an anarchist society as the whole point is a society without imposed power structures, like central banking.  Neither anarchism nor capitalism are defined by the medium of exchange, capitalism is 'the rule of capital,' whoever has the most money wins.   As an oppressive system capitalsim forces people into a Hobbesian dilemma, bitcoin makes that false choice easier to avoid.
