Don't take this the wrong way, but I don't understand your comment about killing yourself if you lost out on a chance at 50 mill. It boggles my mind that people think that way. Someone could literally take 50 million from me (not just the chance at it but actually take it from me) and I still would never think to kill myself.

Belief is not a requirement to got to heaven in my religion. I am a Mormon BTW.
Me believing my car will work and continue to bring me money does mater because you said that I don't believe it will bring me money, so it isn't a religion.
The OP does say that he believes in the technology and that others that believe in the technology will be rewarded financially. I still don't see how you jump to that being religion though.
By definition belief is simply the act of considering something is true, or to hold as an opinion (
Consider these sentences: "I believe the reports." "You wouldn't believe how long it took." "I believe you." "I Couldn't believe my ears." 
I just don't think of religion or church in any of those sentences.
I do agree with you that belief is a central tenant for all religions and scams though. They are also central tenants in about everything really. I wouldn't go to worship if I didn't believe there was a point to it. I wouldn't watch the news if I didn't believe they told me important things. I wouldn't drive to work if I didn't believe that I could get there safely.

I deliver sandwiches for a living, my car definitely brings money.
I believe in God, I do not believe he will bring me money.
What is your point here?

Why does belief have to be tied to religion?
I believe in science. I believe in my car, I believe in myself. How in the world could you think any of those things are a religion?
