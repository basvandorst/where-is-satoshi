Bitbargain.co.uk works great for me. I have used them many times with no problems. It can be expensive but if you time your buys you can get better rates.

I'm from the UK and use bitcoin daily. I always buy back a little more than I spend (just what I like to do) and find it very easy and convenient.

Just bought a pizza from takeaway.com and then purchased some more coins from bitbargain.co.uk.

Remember this but also cannot find. May have been by Alan Watts from memory .... not fully sure though.

From my limited understanding 10 mins is a target. I see it is often faster and I presume will continue to be as increasing hash rate continues. 
Just a thought, but perhaps this may become an issue if miners start to switch off (block halving, unprofitable rig etc) which moves confirmations to begin sitting the other side of the 10 min target ?

Curious as to what extent these positions are being added to. I checked blockchain.info and  on the bitcoinrichlist it's mainly spam with public notes attached. 
I would find it odd if these were privately owned coins being added too in a significant way (such as more than at least 0.01% of holdings at any one time) unless they had some previous large wealth and could afford to do this as further investment. 
I'm sure the owner who has more than 150k BTC would not go out of their way to add  0.0001 BTC to their holdings. 
I'm not reading anything into it.

I am  from the UK and find bitbargain.co.uk very quick and easy. I have done more than 70 purchases with no issues and around 3 mins to receive coins. I then transfer to my own wallet which for me on general spends is breadwallet which I find great.
