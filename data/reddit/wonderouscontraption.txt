Good question. Multiple answers. It was in the news. It was perceived as illicit, and I hoped that would change their perception of me. I hoped they'd look into it or ask me about it, or even learn enough to talk about it with me (mostly did not happen). I suspected the value would go up, and I think giving a gift that appreciates versus one that depreciates is a good idea.
Edit: one more: at the time it was still magic internet money to me. I considered it extremely volatile, which it is, and couldn't promise it'd be worth $1 by Jan1.

This sub had been for Bitcoin the technology. There's for traders. I grant that tons of new subscribers are changing this. And, of course, I'm happy to see BTC's USD value growing.

I heard back from a second family member, a sibling. They had two kids with their partner since I gave the gift originally. They said thanks, but they still had the original paper (Yay!). They asked if I could split the BTC across multiple wallets later this year for their kids' birthdays, and I said I'd help them do it, instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:28:03

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:40:12
I don't think it's very amazing, though. I'm literally giving the same gift twice. I guess it's a matter of perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:39:06
Yup. I didn't for a moment think I'd get this reaction to the story. I certainly don't think giving literally the same gift twice is noteworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:45:54
I agree with your logic. "Correction" followed by new ATH in a few days seems to imply it wasn't actually a correction, but rather panic and/or odd trade volume.

No, I am not thinking of ETFs. Both mutual funds and ETFs can be actively or passively managed. There are plenty of mutual funds with fees less than 0.21%, and the same is true for ETFs. For non-tax-advantaged accounts, ETFs are generally a safer bet because of mutual fund tax implications.

I heard back from one family member. They were thankful, but I don't know that they fully appreciate the gift. They made it clear that they not only no longer had the key from my gift of BTC a few years ago, but also that they did not remember that I'd given them BTC. I keep good records and know my recollection is correct, so I feel a bit sad about their forgetting my gift. I learned that someone they work with has a Bitcoin sticker on his laptop, so that's cool, I guess. I also learned that they spent time on Bitcoin.com today; I told them to use .org instead.

It was worth a fair bit by Dec '13. They're mostly in rural villages where access to tech and tech literacy is sparse.

I don't think BTC compares with either of those. In both tulipmania and dotcommania, well known measures of intrinsic valuation were ignored in favor of rampant speculation. With BTC we have no time-tested way to determine the intrinsic value, and thus we can't determine whether current speculation is rampant.

Because I have email record of transactions I made with a friend, but it was worthless, so I didn't save the key---only the address.

MLM != Ponzi. Good try at some FUD, though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:18:35

All I'll have to share is regret about my wallet containing 100btc dated to ~2009 whose key is lost.

They've got two things no other brand can emulate: astronomical debt loads and fearless leader Musk.
