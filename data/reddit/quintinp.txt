Satoshi Nakamoto is an alien from an advanced civilisation and bitcoin is the currency of the Galaxy. I thought everyone knew that.

If the merchant fixed his price in BTC then you would have to buy it immediately knowing the value of the BTC he was asking would increase as time went by and you would in effect be paying more if you waited.

If you are going to Amazon go via the Young Turks web site to give them a bit of a boost. The Young Turks are an excellent news service.

So the dollar is not a tradable sour of wealth huh? So you can't trade a dollar for a dozen eggs. What a load of nonsense.

Washington is manipulating currencies - forex is not a free market. Gold, Silver, Oil and the Ruble are being devalued and it looks like Bitcoin is in the same boat.
The whole system is being screwed to hide the mess the US economy is in. (another war will fix the economy?)

All we need is for Russia, China and Iran to trade OIL for BTC as a replacement/competition for the Petrodollar and the volatility would be a thing of the past - petrol would come down in price and the whole world could get real.

China have a big problem with people borrowing cheep money 0% in the US and buying Chinese assets. Mostly through Hong Kong. Along comes BTC and the movement of large amounts of value from the US to China became really easy hence the BTC bubble to over $1000.
You can't blame China for clamping down on the free flow of cheep US cash devaluing the Yuan.

If the blockchain is public and the mining was also transparent it could be good. Your debit (credit) card would be attached to your wallet... Still a few hurdles to be jumped yet.
