The idea that NOT committing fraud and usury (which is what the Fed does) would be "disastrous" is absurd.
It's ridiculously irresponsible the way it currently works, and makes USD an unstable, dangerous currency for long term savings.

It's a scam, basically. Central banks print national currency, then charge interest on it, which taxpayers are forced to pay.
This is despite the fact that (at least in the US) the Treasury is fully authorized to print that same money debt-free.
Central banking operates on what is known as "usury" - exorbitantly high interest rates. It's essentially a fraud.

I having a feeling short sellers are going to end up holding the bag. They probably have never seen something like Bitcoin which can recover from manipulation in a few hours instead of days or weeks.
Can't wait to watch them greedily short the market, then left *FUCKED* when Bitcoin price doubles.
The fact of the matter is that there are a lot of people for whom a 50% drop doesn't even touch their profits, so weathering the storm of scumbag manipulators is that much easier.

He's not specifically talking about a payment channel but he is talking about support for the exact mechanism you need to make one. So the intent of that being a possible feature was pretty clear, though it can be used for other things too (escrow as mentioned).

This exactly. Plus those dot com companies were specifically put up on IPOs, despite not meeting any of the usual rules for IPOs (i.e., positive cash flow, in business for X years) due to Goldman Sachs lobbying and changing those rules.
Then they committed fraud by creating the IPOs from insolvent, about-to-tank companies, and used insider trading to make profits on them before the share price crashed.
Spot on about your comment about bubbles.
The dot com bubble was the altcoin equivalent of creating hundreds of pre-mine altcoins, setting the price to $20/coin, then selling before it crashed to $0 and closing down the altcoin network only to do it with another.

Mining is a bit part of why Bitcoin is even popular, so I'm not sure I can agree with this. Proof of Stake is nice and all for the energy savings, but it also isn't really as attractive to people as mining is.
If not for mining Bitcoin would not nearly be as popular as it is today.
Popularity of setting up huge Bitcoin mines seems to be going up, too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:47:00


Yeah but the same is true of e.g., credit cards. Most wouldn't work since no power for the point of sale machine, which is the same deal.
That said I like cash just fine. Gold too.
The poll was worded in a way to make Bitcoin the most attractive bet, simply because it's most likely Bitcoin will go significantly higher in value in 10 years while gold might be more stable.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:20:33
I think gold mining takes way more energy to be fair, it's just not electricity from the grid (instead they tend to use gas generators or engines).
A single industrial dredge + sluice setup and associated vehicle support is probably equivalent to a *huge* Bitcoin mining farm, for instance. Thousands of miners equivalent. These are massive machines.
And it's not even guaranteed any of that energy expenditure will actually net any gold at all, in the case of gold mining.
Gold mining is brutal.

All these exchanges work by having a list of buy orders (I want to buy &lt;X&gt; BTC at &lt;Y&gt; price) and sell orders (I want to sell &lt;X&gt; BTC at &lt;Y&gt; price).
When a buy and sell order "meet" and match up (even partially), an exchange is initiated, and the seller gets some USD, and the buyer some BTC.
These exchanges at their core are simply order matching software, to match up people buying at a given price with those selling at that same price.

Both waiting and not waiting are risky - you might not see a dip any time soon and be stuck waiting as the price goes up.

Bitcoin mining is putting the pressure on to create huge renewable energy farms as well - and it usually makes monetary sense too. 
This should increase pressure on innovation into renewable tech for efficiency/value sake.
I know because I want ~150 kilowatts and it's a huge undertaking to do it, but would ultimately let you keep mining for a couple of years past the normal stop date.
When they stop being useful for mining they can just be used to sell energy back to the grid.

They usually have a direct relationship because the contracts are fulfilled using the actual asset.
Which isn't the case here, since it's all going to be settled in cash, i.e., zero Bitcoin is ever traded.
And as mentioned elsewhere, manipulating the BTC price to trigger your contracts won't be as easy as people think.

How you read it doesn't really matter. What matters is whether or not they'll be able to twist it to fit the ultra-vague definition of "redeemer", which they will, which was obviously the reason for the vague language in the first place.

The people who say ponzi scheme likely heard the MSM say it and are being good little parrots.

More or less correct, yeah, though the money would actually be in your exchange account until you withdrew it to a bank account, and the same of the other person's BTC - it would be in the exchange wallet rather than a personal wallet.

Then another whale (say an old time HODLer) comes along and buys all those discount coins, shoots the price back up, and the shorter is hosed and just lost a massive amount.
There are bear *and* bull whales. 
It's possible to manipulate the Bitcoin price to try and get a short position to work, but by that same token, it's just as easy to manipulate up to prevent that from happening.
Plus there are circuit breakers on the price swings, so it won't be as easy as dumping a ton on an exchange. You'd need to slowly dump a ton of BTC across multiple exchanges at once.
At which point your cheap coins will just slowly get bought by people, negating the downward pressure.
It won't be nearly as easy to manipulate as people think - and CME and Cboe both thought of this before hand.

Land, natural resources (think mines, quarries, lumber, water), livestock etc.
The end game for me isn't Bitcoin itself so much as the ability to use it as leverage for larger more ambitious ventures, with which to buy land and the aforementioned resources.

Legally it's their money as well - you're only entitled to whatever they decide to return, which can be worthless bank stock/IOUs, instead of your cash.

This exactly - this is a great way to accrue more Bitcoin if you're already able to pay your living expenses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:33:52
Spot on, the utility of being able to disallow fraudster banks from doing "bail ins" (i.e., theft of your money) is enough *by itself* to make Bitcoin &gt;$16k.

Difficulty has started climbing again though it doesn't look to be going up very fast.
That said, there are about to be &gt;100 million watts of mining power added to the network next year, probably more like 200Mw. That's an insane amount of power and would push the difficulty up past the point where S9 or DragonMint would be very profitable (might just barely break even).
Unfortunately there aren't any more S9s to be had right now either, and also the power reqs on em are pretty insane (1400W/5.5A).
I love mining and right now I really wish I could buy a ton of good miners and just have em show up right now, but there just aren't any options.
DragonMint looked like an option, but not shipping until April with pre-orders live *now* means that you'd probably lose a ton of gains, and also get your miner *right* when the massive 200Mw datacenters come online, spiking the difficulty a ton.
Right now I'm hoping that by the time GMO Internet's 7nm miners come out (if at all), the difficulty will still be decently low enough to make them feasible, even in large numbers. Unfortunately with multiple giant mining operations coming online before then, who knows if the GMO rigs will be able to compete at all.

You'd be better off HODLing and paying off the car with USD, IMO. The problem is that USD loses value progressively year after year, and quite a lot. 
So if you're on a contract for a payment of $X, paying that for multiple years will net you more Bitcoin in the end than paying it off at once with Bitcoin (remember, capital gains tax) then trying to buy back in as the price is going up. 
But that's just my 2c. It makes it harder, but just HODLing and using your USD for purchases instead is the wisest right now.

Exchanges are indeed middlemen, to facilitate going from USD (or some other fiat) to BTC.
That said, no-middle-man exchanges also exist, such as LocalBitcoins.
