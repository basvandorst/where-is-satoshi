This came at the wrong time, as I had just started using the blockchain wallet again.

Don’t EVER put in what you can’t afford to loose. Be patient, it’s volatile. I tripled my original investment, cashed out and bought a small (modest) car.
No not a Lamborghini, but it’s a car that cost less than buying it in cash.

Theoretically it should be there if I understand all you said correctly, there are also differences in Legacy and Segwit addresses so you should look into that when you use your seed.
I guess that it would be a legacy account from the timeframe you gave.
Not much help but there you go! I’m not the most knowledgeable guy here.
