Maybe.  It's just kinda confusing for people who aren't OP.

afaik, buttcoin isn't currency.
It's a joke.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:23:13
It'll be put to good use, many thanks.

Also a joke.

I assume this is a good buy price all things considered, so it probably wont drop much further.
I'd've bought some, but I'm still waiting to get cleared on coinbase.
Downvotes from all the people who don't want others to know about the low price.  Haha.

Ease of access.  That's why I posted/asked here.
Ultimately, new members need to be brought up to speed.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of noob questions in general either.  The FAQ only points to the total in circulation, without regard to the max or time frame to the end.
I don't mind your criticism.  You're well intentioned, and right in a several ways.
Edit: I had a letter wrong.  Also, this guy is ok, no need to nuke him into orbit.

Quick question, where/how do you set up stop loss orders for bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:58:58


I don't know.  How did you learn?  Did you ever ask other people questions?

All good shows are available online.
Videogames too.

Not really familiar with all that had to do with bitcoin, so searching for answers is more time consuming for me than a regular user.  I don't *talk shop* so to speak.

It's trading like a commodity now, but why would anyone expect anything different?  It's not a dominant currency.
Currently, it ain't currency.  It's not a staple or anything.
I just don't get why people want to rule it out because it's not "money" yet.

56.6%  Alright.
Thanks.  :D

I bought a friend a WOW sub for bitcoin.
You can use it to buy things, but not at every cash register, unless you bring a friend.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:27:23
Yeah, because clearly you can tax the welfare benefits.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:15:39


Then why bother posting in /r/bitcoin?
