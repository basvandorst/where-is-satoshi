So the issue there arises from the fact that upvotes are on an exponential vote volume curve as a higher rated post gains more and more traffic, feeding early voters and content creators returns - but downvotes don't increase a posts visibility or drive more downvotes the way upvotes do. There is no front page for downvotes and nobody would be interested in trying to find the already negative scoring articles to heap on additional downvotes thus paying the initial downvoters. That source of funds for the downvoters and prediction market for downvotes simply cannot work the same way that the upvotes do because upvotes drive traffic to desirable content where as downvotes don't. "Yours" is a prediction market for virality, and downvotes simply aren't a viral process. If you downvote you have no reason to believe someone will downvote after you, paying for a downvote on an article you are making sure no one will see is a bad investment when you could instead pay for an upvote and possibly find something pre-viral.

Every social news aggregate I have ever seen uses the tools you describe - friend and reputation systems - and every single one struggles because those exact systems are ripe for abuse. Are you familiar with the "super user" problem? It's effectively what you propose as a "solution", but in practice leads to corporate abuse.
Spammers do not have a hard time getting through these systems, you are mistaken. Companies pay power users and their networks of like minded promoters to for example upvote hillary articles on reddit and refute hillary criticism. The friend system and repution systems are the vehicle for this activity not the solution.
So adding a huge economic incentive where malicious promoters can actually profit or at least advertise for much cheaper than they do on traditional social networks due to kickbacks and "upvoting" themselves with their own money is going to greatly exacerbate this problem. 
Tagging, friend, and reputation systems are very frequently abused to the end of sponsored content, and every social network currently struggles with these issues.

Right so as a trader (which most of us are) its our responsibility to understand the risk to principle when using an exchange, and if the returns are not worth that risk we need to stop trading until interest rates and returns warrant the risk or the environmental risk of exchanges changes dramatically. No one wants to be told to stop trading, bitcoins price is built on speculation at the moment, but to those who can't protect themselves from risk stopping is exactly what they should have done. Bitcoin isn't yet built to facilitate these sophisticated financial instruments on chain and centralized solutions are ripe with fraud.

Most of bitcoins value is currently derived from speculation, the volume of which requires margin trading and lending.

An exchange is a market for buying/selling bitcoin. A wallet is for holding a currency. Exchanges tend to be companies, wallets are something you can control. A wallet can hold many types of currency, but just like a real life wallet can hold many currencies it cannot transfer value between them. 
Consider this: Where would you deposit your USD to make it go into your wallet? Someone (ie. a company, taking a fee for the service) has to setup a bank account for you to deposit USD to, create a marketplace to buy/sell bitcoin, and popularize it.
You want to engage in high frequency trading. You should find an exchange that exists primarily for that purpose, calculate your costs to fees and transfers carefully, and acknowledge the inherent risk of a business model that will see your capital sitting on an exchange like bitfinex for an extended period. It's gambling, and it can be very profitable or it can ruin you if you aren't careful.
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:26:17
100% this. If this platform becomes popular it will exacerbate unimaginably voting abuse. Malicious advertisers have every incentive to post their garbage with a clickbait title, then pay their own users to upvote with money they give them. Then thanks to the brilliance of "Yours" not only do these content creators get to buy front page links, but then the trailing users eating the sponsored content actually pay out the costs the company spent promoting their clickbait. "Yours" is a system where trailing votes subsidize early voters and content creators, so if the early votes ARE the content creators they effectively get free advertising for anything they can successfully bump to the front page. It pays for itself.
With the history users have rejecting readily abused social networks (digg?) I don't see how this is going to be something users want to use unless you spin them on the idea they are gambling in a prediction market. And even then, you're really just taking advantage of your most vulnerable users and using them to subsidize sponsored content.

It is, but it doesn't represent the same volume as leveraged trading and ergo has a lesser impact on price. I'm not a big leveraged trader or anything, I use bitcoin as a savings account. It's just that leveraged trading is responsible for most of the speculative bitcoin volume and thus drives price, that's just the observable market reality.

It's been that time forever, and it has been obvious to the entire community not to keep anything on exchange since gox. What makes this event any different?

As you can see from the rest of this subreddit there is no love for bfx here. What you are witnessing is the entire community having a laugh at your irrational behaviour and justifications. Address whoever you want, but you are in a public space and almost everyone here is enjoying watching you flail about with your silly justifications. Accept the truth that money not showing up on your UI is not the same as money not in a bfx account. You know how I know it's the truth? If the money wasn't in a bfx account they wouldn't have been able to give you a haircut your transaction would have gone through and nothing could have stopped it. The fact that you are in this situation in the first place is the evidence your money was still in a bfx account at the time of the hack. It would have been impossible for them to take your money otherwise.

A couple points:
1) Apple pays 10k worth of upvotes to themselves, end up with several hours of front page content and it costs them a small fraction of that 10k as they received most if not all of it back in kickbacks. They may even profit before public sentiment turns against them, as people may want to gamble on quickly rising content and get kickbacks themselves for upvotes even on garbage if they think a corp is bumping it. The damage is done, they got their ad out and it cost them nothing, even if you somehow get it off the front page. This is a bad user experience.
2)  Suggesting that the solution is to rely on competing corporate interest is a very silly idea IMO. By doing so you're abandoning any pretense that Yours is anything but a sponsored content platform, and ceding the front page to whichever corporate interest has the largest bankroll.
In fact, I think if Yours does become successful there is a very solid business in creating a bot which identifies quickly rising content whether being artificially inflated or not and upvotes it to get the expected kickbacks. Unless mechanisms which haven't been discussed are put in place to address the issues I'm talking about such a bot would be very viable, and the front page would be purchasable by any sufficiently funded entity while bots like mine piggy back on corporate abuse skimming some profits while further enabling this artificial content promotion.
If you want an acknowledgement that these issues are real without current obvious solutions, deeper in this thread Ryan commented about his perspective on these problems. I get the impression Ryans view is that it will be easier to define a strategy to defend against this behavior once it's observably occurring. But without a solution to this problem as part of the application design, it's my opinion that ignoring this fundamental issue for now is just kicking the can down the road. If Yours is to ever be successful this is a barrier it must deal with eventually.

If selling is such a brilliant strategy why didn't you sell at 19k? If it's 17k tomorrow will you still be right? Did you sell everything you owned at 1k in 2013? What about at the MtGox bust in early 2014?
Pretending that calling the top or bottom of any run is as simple and foolproof as opening your mouth is irresponsible. You are more likely to lose your ass short term trading then you are holding. Trying to triple your money on a short term movement is pretty much the definition of short term trading and pretending it is riskless or even less risky than long term holding is absurd.
Holding is a much more viable long term trading strategy than thinking you know anything about where the price is going tomorrow. Asserting you have any knowledge or awareness of where the price will be in the short term is supremely stupid. Being an evangelical of such knowledge is even worse. Compared to the advice you're giving the advice to hold is outright conservative. You are urging people to sell into what is already a 50% market correction. For all you know this is the bottom, for all you knew two days ago 15k was the bottom. You could very plausibly be urging people to sell at the bottom of the trend just as people were urging people to buy at the top. You don't know shit.

I"m aware of the great work the NIST does, but people looking for an authority in an authority-less network are already failing on some fundamental level. Correcting the authority in a panic because they don't understand soft versus hard forks is, well, funny.
I was talking to a gentleman from the NIST at CES a few weeks ago. They were looking for consultation about blockchains in general. The information they are basing things like this report on is coming from outside consult. With how many people are calling themselves blockchain experts it's not really surprising that absurd descriptions like the one about BCH are entering their publications. I don't think that should be a call to action for us to correct them, but an illustration that they are playing catch up as opposed to setting their usual standard. They are still trying to wrap their heads around this just like most people. If people want to point to the NIST as the authority on blockchain let them, it really speaks more about those people and where the NIST is at on this subject matter than it does blockchain technologies.

It's really funny that you keep evoking memories of 2014. Did you hold through 2014/2015? I did, kept buying in fact, and everyone else who did is pretty happy about it. If there is another 2 year bear market, good enough. The technology has nothing at all to do with the price.
Timing the market is how you lose your ass. If you are panicked about price being 5k tomorrow or 15k you are gambling with money you need and should stop. Be worried about what the price will be in a decade if you need something to worry about. It's an all or nothing value proposition, there is no 1k, 5k, 20k bitcoin in 10 years. It's either $0 or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Everything in between is a mad gamble.
Holding isn't idiotic, gambling like you're some kind of professional day trader with wealth you literally need is idiotic. To anyone who hasn't invested more than they can lose holding is a fantastic strategy, betting on a larger game than what the price will be tomorrow but what it will be in years time.

There are a lot of bold women out there. Women who take risks. Women who manage multi bullion dollar industries and countries. I think if women and minorities had equal representation in technical fields and access to wealth in 2009 as did white men we'd have seen a very different demographic entering Bitcoin. IMO it's very unfortunate that so many cultural factors dissuade women from these fields, we could have made a big leap towards a more egalitarian future with bitcoin and instead we did the opposite.

I couldn't disagree more. Men are nurturing, many men favor care/love/beauty. There are many cultures, even tribal cultures which have no place even entering this conversation, which invert what you would consider typical gender roles or have more than 2 genders even. That you cannot accept that in the modern western world your idea of "tribal" gender roles is unapplicable, never mind that it wasn't ever applicable, is an absurd product of your own culture. 
Frankly your response is the worst kind of culturally ingrained sexism. Take an anthropology class. Learn about the great diversity of tribal gender roles. Then take a modern gender studies class. Learn about the great diversity of current gender roles. The only one trying to force a view of the world is you, the evidence that the world is not the way you think is abundant both now and throughout history.

Decentralization is 4 factors applying to 2 bodies in bitcoin and bitcoin cash.
4 Factors:
* Number of bodies
* Geopolitical distribution of bodies
* Influential distribution of bodies (Not all owned or influenced by the same parties)
* The resource cost to influence the collective bodies
2 Bodies:
* Miners
* Nodes
Copying the code of Bitcoin and starting a new coin the way Bitcoin Cash did doesn't give the network decentralization. If a network has over half of its nodes and over half of its miners in one place and influenced by one party (which Bitcoin Cash does, the majority of nodes are on AWS instances and the majority of mining power is in China from one company) it is not decentralized.
Decentralization is an emergent network property. It is created by a series of Nash Equilibrium based incentives which encourage actors to behave responsibly. It's usually described in the cost to change or influence the factors I listed above. It's not a binary state of having it or not, it's a sliding measure.
There are other factors which may influence the factors I listed above. One of them is resource usage. The more resources it costs to participate in the network the fewer participants there will be. Bitcoin Cash advocates, also many other altcoin advocates like Ethereum, aren't terribly concerned with storing every single coffee purchase of every person for all time on every computer in the network. The reality is that principle just doesn't scale. The more you go down that path the more centralized you necessarily become, until eventually as a function of time all the nodes exist in large data centers in the hands of one or two companies in one or two legal jurisdictions. It reduces the cost to attack the network down to a fraction of its previous cost when nodes where across the globe acting as independent security agents for the network and makes the number of actual protocol participants shrink to near nothing. It may support a billion end users, but none of them will be actually using the trustless protocol, they will be trusting someone.
Bitcoin Cash exists because they view end users are more important than the integrity of the networks long term decentralization. Bitcoin doesn't want to take that scaling route until it is absolutely necessary and all other options have been exhausted - of which we have many.
So is Bitcoin Cash decentralized? No. It could maybe be someday but right now it's not. It is not good for Bitcoin Cash to have a small body of parties controlling all the factors of decentralization. I also don't agree with the code change for larger blocks. It may be better for users, but it's a terrible engineering decision and more than that sets a bad precedence regarding scaling decisions.

It's not quite so easy. A lot of the power being used on mining isn't going anywhere else - the demand doesn't exist yet. Often many power plant operators in rural china are either mining themselves or have a direct relationship with the miners. The power bill is whatever the power company says it is, if they choose to get paid under the table by miners -  a practice I am sure already occurs in volume - there is no power bill to reference.
It's like saying they will catch marijuana growers based on their power bill. Works fine and dandy when these people are growing dope in the suburbs, but what happens when it's the power companies themselves growing dope? It doesn't work at all.
Couple this with the financial incentives for local enforcement to look the other way in the form of taxes and bribes,  I severely doubt the majority of miners are leaving China anytime soon. It would take a serious nationally driven crackdown where national entities with no financial stake in local mining somehow find these places and raid them with force to accomplish what China intends.

It's pretty well documented with the affect turning on and off as price or political events transpire. You can see it both on the blockchain as you look at these transactions with absurd numbers of inputs and in the mempool as huge spontaneous peaks and valleys. It's not bad at all. If any crypto is to succeed they need to be hardened to these kinds of attacks. If we can't deal with attacks we aren't decentralized, we aren't viable, and there is no point in us even being here. I think it's absolutely brilliant that we have created a system where instead of taking the network down DDoS style attacks literally pay for the networks security infrastructure.

Inflation is a useful term when talking about the purchasing power of money, and influencing inflation is a primary job of the Federal Reserve including minting new money supply and setting the interest rate.

I didn't ignore it I explicitly acknowledged it. All of that is true and it doesn't change the fact that necessarily, as a body,the Fed must be less transparent than Bitcoin simply because of the medium and mechanisms of its function. I'm sorry you have so much difficulty accepting that a governance process could be completely transparent and because it is run by people and shifting governments still be opaque relative to an auditable static algorithm. It's is simple, written in stone, transparent.

The way I see it is a solid protocol will inevitably lead to a higher price as a function of time. There are enough use cases for a decentralized network that having only 21 million units to transfer across that network mandates a higher price than tens of thousands of dollars per unit if it works. If people want to avoid inflation, or local government mismanagement, or store off-shore wealth, or evade draconian capital controls, or engage in criminal activity Bitcoin must be worth more than it is now to facilitate that value transfer. We don't need any governments endorsement and we don't need the NIST. Appealing to either like we do need them for Bitcoin to have value is naive.
A lot of people think the USA banning Bitcoin would be it's death, I think it would be Bitcoins beginning. Once there is irrefutable proof Bitcoin cannot be shut down it validates the decentralized security model and the financial revolution finally begins in earnest.
Now that may never happen. If governments are smart it won't. Either way, I don't need the NIST to set any standards for me in this instance regardless of how excellent their work in the field typically is.

That's kind of covered in that first bullet point, it's an investment in a decentralized platform on which we can build a decentralized future. Borderless, authority-less, automated future. If I ever have a technical reason to believe we are not moving in that direction I would sell everything, but price is not a technical attribute it's a speculative one. It could crash to $200 tomorrow and I would still be using it for the same thing, buying more. However if tomorrow the price jumped $10k but network statistics made it clear it was no longer decentralized, that technical development was being abandoned, and JP Morgan had entire reorganizational control over bitcoins blockchain I would sell.
As I just edited into that first bullet point, there is no 10k, 20k, 1k bitcoin. It's either 100k or it's worth nothing. It's either secure or it isn't, it's either decentralized or it isn't. I have every reason to believe from a technical background that it is and will continue to be moving towards that 100k path as a function of decades and building that decentralized future.
When it does finally reach an appreciable marketshare it will gain values you personally attribute to currency like stability, like not being cashed out upon being received, like being traded directly p2p and in a manner that is efficient and cost effective without relying on appreciation to cover costs.

Their rating systems is a riot. Their grading mechanisms are based almost entirely on price fluctuations and things like "transaction speed". They claim to factor in technology based on white paper reviews but it doesn't look like they have a significant comprehension of whatever papers they are reading or Bitcoin would have necessarily scored higher by their own descriptions. It's pretty obvious no reading of lightning was considered as that would equate to instant transaction times which they claim to be looking for. It's clear no reading of drivechains or sidechains or any other layering mechanism was considered as that would equate to scalability and ease of adding new features which they also claim to be grading on. It's clear no examination of atomic swaps occurred or there would have been higher grades for blockchain interoperability. Bitcoin should have aced every one of these categories. Overall a totally misinformed joke.

Have a better decentralization or economic security model? No. Have better technologies? Absolutely. The cream of the crop end up moving to bitcoin however, just as we're seeing with RSK which is essentially a pegged version of ethereum with more discardable data and as a result better scaling.
The only thing substantially different about this space and traditional software is decentralization. It's the be all end all, the goose which lays the golden egg. Protocols which are able to benefit from Bitcoins decentralization will do amazing as they join to form a protocol web of functionality, protocols which want to live in isolation will suffer.
As sidechains, drivechains, and offchain protocols are built around bitcoin it is entirely possible that altcoins will conceptually become a thing of the past in favor of these new avenues to accomplish similar goals. Or maybe altcoins will become tied to bitcoin through atomic swaps giving them new life and assuring no governmental interference in future ICOs. I don't know. All I know is decentralization is what I need and Bitcoin has it. Everything else is a crapshoot, even amazing technologies.
Addressing your edit: 


This just isn't true. You have amazing technologies like ethereum but they *mandate* fast blocks, it's an absolute necessity. The faster the blocks the higher the orphan rate, the more blocks generally the more data being stored. Things that affect decentralization. it's a necessary trade off between decentralization and features. That's why pegging ethereum 1:1 with an underlying security layer like Bitcoin has so much potential - like RSK. We get to create a segregated playground within which to "move fast and break things", but at the same time lean on bitcoins decentralization instead of trying to rebuild the economic security model.

So you spend a high on chain fee one time to enter the lightning network then don't worry about any fees until you spend all your money. Paying a fee once a year versus every transaction is a very different cost model.
More than that if everyone is moving transactions to lightning on chain fees will quickly reduce. So there won't be high on chain fees.

Maybe the problem here is you are using your imagination instead of looking at the observable reality.


Absolutely, I do it because:
* I work in this field and I understand the unique properties a global decentralized trust platform offers, and the future it makes possible - and part of that possible future requires a significantly more valuable bitcoin than exists now. There is no 10k, 20k, 1k bitcoin. It's either 100k or it's worth nothing. It's either secure or it isn't, it's either decentralized or it isn't. I have every reason to believe from a technical background that it is and will continue to be moving towards that 100k path as a function of decades and building that decentralized future.
* It yields me tangible benefits as an investment and savings account in that the value of my retirement savings goes up on average every year.
I've endured multi year bear markets and multi year bull markets. When it is a bull market I use more bitcoin to buy things than I do in bear markets. When it's a bear market a larger percentage of my income goes into my savings. Just like the purchasing power of your savings account grows or shrinks depending on how the economy you are in is doing, so does mine and I act accordingly.
The answer couldn't be simpler. I do it because as a strategy it has done very well for me financially. It does me well despite moments of high fees, it does me well despite bear markets and bull markets. Not only has it been a financial boon but I take great pleasure in being my own bank.
I'm not a trader, I can't daytrade and predict what the market is going to do next - I only know that decentralization as a network property is so unbelievably unique and valuable and I will follow it with my long term savings wherever it leads.

It is divisible, and even more divisible on additional layers and could be forked to be divisible even further on the main chain. Limited supply is a feature not a disadvantage, it means the market can't be flooded by new coins - only ones that already exist and are publicly accounted for, even their movement observed. Deflationary currency has use cases and is a unique and desirable property. Should it be the only currency, is inflation a dirty word? No. Inflation is an important tool to manage an economy. Having a global deflationary currency however means people can escape the mismanagement of their local economies and other important use cases.

Have you imagined a world where your house can airbnb itself without you participating at all? Pay its own mortgage? Where your car can pay its own lease and operate as its own uber, all with no company taking a cut or exerting its influence? What about a world where your last will and testament can be executed automatically without a lawyer or bank ever being involved? We're talking a world of p2p insurance, lending, and credit. Where instant borderless global transactions can occur, where people oppressed by their local governments have a means of financially escaping tyranny? Where a company can be autonomously organized and run, where an election can be cast with fully public audit-ability, where governments and organizations of all manner can be run trustlessly? Imagine your governments, companies, non profits entire fiscal control being revoked and an election via blockchain layer being triggered due to auditable financial abuse. The potential is amazing. It's what a lot of people think of when they think Ethereum, but building on the more decentralized blockchain in layers is the means of assuring this reality actually comes to fruition and doesn't become centralized. If it's centralized it can be controlled, influenced, and ultimately shut down as has every attempt to create such a mechanism in the last 40 years.
We've already got the most important part of that future, a trustless base platform enabling individual financial sovereignty. All that's left to do is build the rest in layers on top of it, resolving to this trustless state. We are building a new kind of financial trustless internet, a platform for a new kind of world.  Bitcoin is the base layer of that platform.
As for what makes me think it is decentralized: the network statistics in terms of nodes and miners, the cost to reorganize or attack the blockchain, the ability for anyone to participate. Global availability in the form of radio, internet, and satellite nodes and miners. Decentralization is not a binary state of yes or no, it's a cost at this point. Bitcoin by far has the largest cost to attack it. As we have seen in 2017 even when that cost is breached, with billions of dollars in miners colluding under the banner of a handful of companies nodes can still hold them to the fire and force the network to act in a decentralized manner. In short, the security mechanisms of the bitcoin protocol make it the most decentralized network on the planet. There is no Ethereum foundation to be hounded by the SEC, you can't build a botnet virus to attack it. The financial incentives will *always* align to reward those who secure the network as opposed to attack it. It's beautiful game theory and engineering and cryptography all rolled into one.

For the vast majority of bitcoin users trying to conceptualize bitcoin or decentralization is like trying to guess the impact of the internet in the 1980's. The frame of reference they use to consider bitcoin, like comparing it to traditional currencies and thinking about fees strictly from an end users perspective or thinking about adoption like its a business (looking at you roger) is understandable and forgivable. I mean, what percentage of people here know what a hash time locked contract is or think that trading them through hubs is centralization? How many people are even aware of what a drivechain or the lumino compression protocol or schnorr signature are or how they work?Bitcoin has thrust into the hands of laymen sophisticated concepts that force them to simplify to relatable existing things. And that's perfectly good and fine. We don't all need to be computer scientists, every day new and more simplified end user functionality gets closer to something they can digest. Decentralization is a valuable and unique concept, so long as people keep contributing into this fascinating technology stack we're going to accomplish amazing things. I don't get worked up over upvotes or price.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:59:26


Hash Time Locked Contracts are traded off chain between two parties without a global broadcast mechanism. The only time the HTLCs might need to be broadcast is on the blockchain to prevent fraud. Otherwise HTLCs are unicast, reducing the number of transactions any node sees to just those moving through its channels.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:36:29
I'm not sure you understood my response and I am not sure what about this conversation you feel is unproductive.
You can't do anything to stop the ddos of a given node, your node for example, any more than anyone can for any service. Lightning isn't a solution for ddos attacks. But if a node is taken out of th enetwork it doesn't affect the whole signficantly, transactions which may have preferred to go through a ddos'd channel can be routed around if another route to their destination exists - which there almost certainly would be. If the destination itself is ddos'd for days on end the service can simple move to a new IP for the fraction of a second necessary to perform any channel closing operations or on-chain activities and rely on traditional ddos mitigation strategies otherwise. If for some reason the ddos victom can't get on chain to perform an in-process transaction the HTLC's composing the funds time out and no money is spent in that instance, all returning to its owners.
This is the exact same situation you would be in if they ddosed your bitcoin node. Because a bitcoin node is how lightning interacts with the blockchain. It *is* your bitcoin node being ddos'd. Just like how a website which monitors the blockchain for payments, a business, can't monitor for payments when they are being ddos'd. Lightning doesn't solve that issue. That said, even though the business might get ddos'd the larger network is fine in either instance, and the business can simply change IP's or other ddos mitigating strategies.

Transaction fees being high pay for and reinforce our security model. The higher the fees the more incentive to mine, the more secure we are. Especially in the face of so-called "spam" transactions like BCH and BTC are seeing, if the options are spam pays for the security model versus spam gets publish en masse to the blockchain to live forever without significantly changing the miner reward and pushing the attack costs onto unpaid nodes for the entire duration of the blockchains life, I'd much rather reinforce the security model.
Volatility is an advantage because it creates use cases as much as it  limits them. Traders make up a huge percentage of the population, volatility is their bread and butter. Without volatility at this point in the life cycle it would mean we've hit our potential, we've met bitcoins value and potential marketshare. Obviously we haven't and lord knows we don't want to have with only 1% market penetration.

I need to just take a second and talk about how cool lightning is.
It's an ACH system built by smart contracts structured in such a way as to be completely free of counter party risk. Any number of parties join in creating a channel via smart contract on the bitcoin blockchain.
The details of the opening smart contract are essentially: Lock up X funds from N parties and disburse them when a valid closing state is published by any of the parties. This is analogous to a traditional ACH relationship with another ACH or party.
This is where I think things get brilliant. Once these funds are locked up in a channel the participants can essentially trade signed transactions as cash. These signed transactions which are exchanged as promissory notes are called Hash Time Locked Contracts. They are Bitcoin blockchain publishable signed transactions which testify that a payment was made.
So the channel participants trade around these signed promises for payment until someone decides to close the payment channel. They post to the Bitcoin blockchain the end state of the channel and a 3 day contention period begins. In those 3 days any channel participant can deny that the channel was closed properly and *prove* it by publishing a transaction they were holding as cash off-chain. These promissory notes, when published, revoke the bitcoin from any potential thief and distribute it to the remaining channel participants as well as the rest of the bitcoin locked in the channel as per its final provable closing state.
Each channel is thus trustless (as these promissory notes in the form of HTLC remove any trust, the only person who can sign them is the person who controls the bitcoins). Channels can be chained together as quickly as these HTLC's can be transferred over the internet and held by their owners to be redeemed in the event of fraud.  Each channel only ever knows about its common participants, making multi-channel transactions anonymous.
I love the world we're building on top of this network of trust. It's so much fun to learn about.

Sure. How technical a description would you like?
It basically comes down to the fact that lightning has no blockchain. It's like trading signed smart contracts which are bitcoin publishable as cash, and if someone starts lying on chain you just publish your cash and it proves what happened. This means transactions can occur as quickly as you can send these smart contracts as cash over IP. Near instant transactions = near instant arbitrage.
If Bitcoin is 20500 USD at one exchange and 20000 USD at another, and both exchanges have lightning wallets you can buy at the 20000 USD exchange and then immediately sell at the 20500 USD exchange netting yourself $500 profit per coin. This works for all BTC currency pairs.

The things you think are issues we think are features. If you don't like it and can't see the world we will build anchored to Bitcoin that's your loss not ours.
1. Bitcoin is the great experiment in deflationary global economics. It allows users to save and avoid local inflation like no mechanism before. We see this as a wonderful and unique feature.
2. Bitcoin is necessarily either worth hundreds of thousands per coin or nothing. It is either decentralized trust or it is nothing. It is either secure or it is nothing. We can either build on top of it or it is nothing. Expect volatility between the realization of those goals and now.
3. Transaction times for several layers on top of Bitcoin are immediate, and Bitcoin settlement times stand at 10 minutes. That is faster than any settlement engine in the world.
4. Imagine if we just invented roads and everyone in the world had to share a single road. Bitcoin is a shared resource it is natural for there to be congestion at times. Further Bitcoin is under attack by users who are paying many times the amount being transfered to consolidate hundreds of inputs. This isn't bad. If people want to pay to spam Bitcoin the only thing that happens is miners make more money and it reinforces our security model. For microtransactions second layers resolving to Bitcoin are available.
Bonus Q: Bitcoin is the network of trust. It will be an anchor we use to build a world of trustless features. Digital gold is just one thing it does.

Lightning uses bitcoin smart contracts as currency, and instead of publishing those bitcoin transactions to the chain they are transacted directly between peers. If you have a signed transaction that gives you bitcoin if published, it's as good as bitcoin. You only need to actually publish it if someone tries to defraud you. So you can make all these offchain transactions with full assurances of the bitcoin value.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:14:25
I say "attack" because that's what it objectively is. No legitimate use cases results in transactions with hundreds of inputs of a single satoshi sent with transaction fees thousands of times the value of the sent value sent in mass volumes simultaneously. It's not a bad thing, the worst it does is raise fees and pay miners which reinforces the security model - but pretending the volume isn't artificial or malicious is just being blind.

What does any of that have to do with the unpredictable nature of politics? I'm not some anti Fed abolish happy moron, I'm a guy who wants to be able to save his money and not have it's purchasing power drop to nothing as punishment for taking it out of circulation.
Every mechanism of the Feds operation is well documented no one is arguing about that. What we are arguing about is whether or not documentation of a process counts as transparency. Certainly not every meeting the Fed chair is in is public knowledge. Certainly not every internal.memo is public knowledge. We aren't privy to sharing the thoughts of the Fed chairman on any day and we certainly cannot predict with any accuracy what the Fed is going to do in ten years time.
That makes the Fed as an institution less transparent than software. That is simply a fact. Anyone can know 100% of every detail regarding a public algorithm. You cannot possibly know every detail of the inner workings of the Fed at a given moment. If you did you wouldn't have to wait for them to announce interest rates. You wouldn't need them to announce QE. It wouldn't need to be reported on as news. There is no news about Bitcoin fiscal policy because it was written transparently in stone 9 years ago. Can you not appreciate that world of difference? There is no means available for the Fed to even approach the transparency of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:25:05
Because both chains experience the exact same thing, and if you want to get technical about it BTC has been experiencing it longer. That's the unfair part of it. More of these transactions stay in mempool and expire on BTC (causing the "attack" to result in higher fees) while on BCH they usually get published (causing the "attack" to result in negligible fee increases since there is comparably little BCH use but explode the size of the blockchain).
There are a million things you can be critical of BCH for, focusing on something that affects everyone is an unfair criticism. The appropriate criticism is that while Bitcoin handles attacks by forcing attackers to pay for the security model, Bcash pushes the cost of attacks for the rest of the blockchains life on unpaid node runners.

I don't agree that is a big deal. The day the government needs to approve of bitcoin for it to be functional is the day I sell. I hear where you're coming from and you're not even a little bit wrong, but looking to the government for laws to enable bitcoin or definitions about what is the true bitcoin is antithetical to bitcoins existence. We are not defined by them. Our success is not reliant on government or microsofts adoption. While they may very well adopt, or make mistakes in identifying the "true" bitcoin, the amount that should impact us collectively is zero.

Pretty much all of those risks are identical to running other node based protocols like bitcoin or tor. Routing not being solved is essentially like saying "what if no one adopts lightning" much as tors routing problem would exist if no one adopted tor, if someone you want to make a payment to accepts it then you can open a channel with them. Centralization risk is fairly identical to tor or bitcoin centralization risk with the caveat that lightnings nodes must be decentralized and bitcoin must also be decentralized in both nodes and PoW. Legal is going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction but again, very similar in principle to these other services. It's possible lightning will come under legal threat just as bitcoin and tor sometimes do, as it's possible for criminals to use all of these services. Nothing about lightning is special in regards to ddos attacks, just like bitcoin nodes can be ddos attacked. I guess one provision against ddos attacks being effective is you can simply route around them, all routes would need to be ddos'd to be effective.
All in all nothing really that different from running a bitcoin node or any other node protocol participant. The biggest difference is the need for a hot wallet which is a security risk.

IMO presenting the downsides as equals isn't very fair. The security implications of storing keys in a hot wallet for the network to function are far more significant than either the requirement to be monitoring the blockchain or the change in implications of a 51% attack which is already a debilitating attack on the underlying blockchain. IMO having to use a hot wallet is the real security disadvantage here.

This is not true. There is substantial value for everyone in atomic swaps. Bitcoin gets to surge on the growth of fast paced break-things mentality end user functionalities while retaining its valuable decentralization and conservatism, altcoins get an emergency escape route and to rely on bitcoins decentralization in the face of government pressure, and everyone gets to interact with off chain protocols and resources.
You are so so so very wrong when you think about cryptocurrency as an us or them mentality. We are going to end up with a rich protocol web where sophisticated end user functionality is achieved by routing tasks through this web and its various layers. We are making a new kind of decentralized financially driven internet. The only reason I am only invested in BTC is because decentralization is the only for-sure winner in this space, what ends up being in use throughout the rest of this protocol web is a crapshoot. Will it be opcode capable altcoins which become popular? Will it be off chain resources? I don't know. We'll see.

Your rejection of the term "socialist" is a cultural product of a national propaganda abusing the word for decades. You cannot accept being anything near socialist because socialism is a demonized enemy of freedom. The propaganda has become so ingrained in your culture you can't even get healthcare that the state pays for like every other first world country - another cold war born term.
Remove yourself from your culture and maybe you'll see that Norway and Canada aren't counter examples of socialism working. Such a comparison implies Venezuela is socialist, which is why you have framed those thoughts as counter examples because they fit your predefined semantics. In reality those countries are illustrations you are using the term socialism wrong, not comparative examples at the range of success and failure of socialism.

Since you are an oracle I'm sure you know exactly what the price is going to be unlike him, which is why you told everyone to buy the dip today right?
"Timing an exit" i.e. taking profit is easy, you do it when you are in the green. Good way to reach the point of your exit is to hold until you are green. Pretty big difference between that and asserting what the price is about to be while encouraging people to trade on that information.

It's so much more than a speculative store of value but that's certainly a popular use case.

All HTLCs are single use, time sensitive, and transaction specific for this exact reason. No one has a given proof of payment except you and the single individual you paid in that single instance. It can only prove the single transaction occured and is useless beyond shouting "fraud!" in the instance that someone is lying about that transaction in the closing state of the channel. Someone else having it or using it does nothing, it's only possible function is in proving that one transaction in the instance of fraud.


There is no trusting any of the other parties, that's part of the brilliance! Because each individual channel is trustless using the mechanisms I just described - that is you can report fraud in your own channel - it makes all the channels in a given chain trustless since all parties in the chain rely on the same prehash secret (the hash part of the hash time locked contract, these contracts are unlocked by either time or a prehash). If one part of the multi channel HTLC chain is exposed it necessarily uses the prehash to unlock the contract, this unlocks everyone else in the chains HTLCs as well since they are using the same prehash and the entire transaction chain can thus be proven completed. Trust never enters the equation, these HTLCs give each channel user the tools to protect their offchain resources by proving they were paid offchain in the event anyone lies on chain. It's a system where valid on chain transactions only need to be published if someone starts trying to break the rules, thus you gain the trustless properties of blockchains and smart contracts without the need to publish every single one.
I think if you go ahead and read some of the resources on lightning you will find the attacks you are thinking about as well as the trust you think exists don't really exist at all. Seriously, it's very very interesting how the kinds of attacks you mention are thwarted, especially the common prehash multi channel hops.

nlocktime is a transaction property, a way to make a transaction stuck until a given block height. You could use it to, for example, keep your coins unavailable for every day but one of a month, upon which day you send them again with the same nlocktime. Think of nlocktime like a post dated cheque that locks up your funds.
I'm not sure which wallets support nlocktime, I'm only familiar with using bitcoind to use nlocktime.

What's "great for bitcoin" is fairly subjective. You are probably defining what's great for bitcoin as what is great for bitcoin's price or adoption in the short term. Another definition might be what results in positive outcomes for the protocol. A bitcoin ban would not be the death of bitcoin but would be a further exhibition and hardening of its censorship resistant properties. It would be the death of hostile actors like coinbase. It would elevate bitcoin to the world stage. There are many potential benefits to the US engaging in a vain war on bitcoin.

There are a lot of ways. Private keys can be encrypted and scattered between safety deposit boxes and lawyers (Winkelvoss). You can require an entire companies board of directors to use a multisig key to make any transactions from an offline wallet (bitmex).

Also, sign all your transactions offline!

Most of the world is socialist. This is what dictatorship looks like.

Consensus is not a democracy. There is no voting and there is no equality of participation. Everyone is free to decide their own validation rules and what they mine but a Nash equilibrium keeps all parties working towards the networks best interests.

Close. Alice would see Bob is offline and gamble he isn't using a watchtower. She would then send a stale closing state that favors her over Bob. Bob then has the resolution time of the channel to come back online and broadcast a justice transaction to claim Alice's funds and recover his own. If he doesn't Alice gets however much of his funds were hers in the old channel state.
The other scenario is Bob makes a mistake and broadcasts a stale channel state, then Alice sends a justice transaction and takes Bob's side of the channel entirely as punishment for the attempted fraud.

Ethereum is a great example of everything wrong with altcoins.
1. Centralized to the point that the Ethereum foundation can call off a fork hours before it is scheduled to occur, something impossible in a decentralized space.
2. Unscalable. The ethereum blockchain is so bloated their scaling strategy is to entirely abandon it. Not exactly what I would call immutable when you are discarding the entire chain.
3. Dangerous. When the people who invented the environment can screw up smart contracts so bad that they have to fork the entire chain to stop their own hacks what chance does everyone else have? Ethereum is just enough rope to hang yourself with and we see it constantly with smart contract "hacks".
People excited about ethereum tech don't understand it or that anything altcoins can do is better done in layers on bitcoin secured by bitcoins PoW.

Yes, I tried to explain in as simple terms as I possibly could because you clearly have no understanding of the underlying technology. Unlike you I didn't do it to be rude, I did it because you don't understand on a technical level how the bittorrent protocol is implemented. Instead of even trying to digest those explanations you became offended.


If you don't need decentralization you should look for distributed systems. Decentralization is grossly inefficient, literally the most inefficient method of data storage and verification. Go make PayPal 2.0. I see the value of decentralization as a platform, who cares that you can't?
You should enjoy bcash, I honestly wish the best for you and it - but don't pretend you have any idea what you're talking about when it comes to software, protocols, or decentralization.

We have a responsibility to think of ten years from now not just tomorrow. If we want to preserve a decentralized future we must build in layers.
Bitcoin is not a business. We are not interested in short term profit at the expense of long term survivabiity. We are a protocol and as participants we are part of the worlds first and most decentralized network. We will preserve those attributes.
It's not that we have no sympathy for users, or don't want lower fees ourselves. But these attributes of decentralization which are so globally unique are under attack and we must protect them. There are a million ways to transact value for cheap. While we'd like to be one of them and intend to be again in the future, we don't find it acceptable to trade being the only one of something in the world for being one of a million.

I know that from the laymen's perspective it might seem like torrents are decentralized but they require a "tracker" which acts as the sort of brains of the operation. They effectively tell clients where they can find peers and what parts are in the file. Trackers are centralized and a pivotal part of the bittorrent protocol. 
That's what is so very unique about Bitcoin. It requires no centralized entity. What Bcash and even ethereum are doing by creating blockchains that explode in resource cost and size  as a function of time is creating a future where they operate exactly like torrents, with a few major entities acting as the entire network backbone. It's a problem Bitcoin faces as well, we are just minimizing it's affect by keeping blocks smaller than our competitors. When was the last time you synced a full node? I had to last month, it took 4 days and a dedicated hard drive - with over 50% of the time spent downloading and verifying just the last year and a half. Can you even imagine what it will be like in 10 years at our current rate of growth?
There has never been a decentralized network before Bitcoin. There is no entity in the protocol which acts as the brains or does the work of an authority like there is in torrents.

Trying to explain to frustrated users who want lower fees that the short term doesn't matter, that panicking at fee attacks is exactly the wrong response to secure the network is like trying to convince someone to eat a salad instead of a pizza because it's better for them in the long term. Users aren't thinking long term.
Someone wants to attack bitcoin and it's costing them an arm and a leg in their attempt. The effectiveness of that attack is entirely up to you and your reactions.
Take a minute and just marvel at the wonder that is Bitcoin. We're part of a network which doesn't need to make DDoS type attacks illegal, just expensive, and when we do get the equivalent of DDoS attacked the people trying to attack the network end up paying for the network infrastructure and further securing it. *DDoS attacks end up further securing our network*, how amazing is that? Lets see Mastercard pull that trick off.
Is it frustrating that fees are high? Yes. Is there a plan for combating high fees and re-enabling low fee and quick confirming transactions in the face of an ongoing attack? Yes, we're building L2 solutions. While we wait for those solutions to come to fruition however lets just bask in the glory that is our economic security model and rejoice, lets make our attacker spend as much money as possible for as little return as can be imagined. No panic, just glee that millions of dollars can be spent attacking us and result in no denial of service at all.
Truly this is what decentralization and the economic security model is all about. We cannot be stopped, at worst we can be temporarily inconvenienced and the incentive for our miners further reinforced. I find that absolutely beautiful.

Lightning transactions will have very small fees - due both to the nature of the infrastructure and competition driving fees down. Those fees go to nodes which route transactions. We don't yet know how small those fees will be, I personally imagine coinjoin will always pay more to service providers but I'm not interested in helping people launder their money.

ADL is pretty messed up as it can lead to positions in profit being force closed. They didn't make their insurance funds public - maybe they do now. They used to be some of the most vocal critics of okexchange and 100x leverage until they adopted it themselves. They still replace references to okex with "the woodchipper", which it is, but it's the pot calling the kettle black at this point. Of course they also support a horde of shitcoins.

It relies on decentralized payment processors. Not decentralized with the same security model as Bitcoin, much like Bcash or Ethereum or Litecoin don't as network agents have the same security model. 
Ethereum has as much decentralization as it can currently afford. Any more would prohibit function much the way some functions are prohibited by Bitcoin such as instantaneous payments and turing complete smart contracts.
This is why people started making altcoins in the first place, they wanted to make something like Bitcoin but with a different balance of priorities.
With atomic swaps between on chain and off chain resources, what has been done is create layer segregated function. We can accomplish the same job we have been doing with altcoins - experiment with different feature sets and decentralization models - but while being completely interoperable with each other in a decentralized manner anchored to bitcoin. In this way we can preserve Bitcoins most unique function - decentralization - and use it as an anchor for all these new and existing protocols. Bitcoin becomes the "base" layer in a protocol stack enabling all manner of disparate concerns and end user enabling functionality.
Lighting is just a proposed layer in this protocol stack which enables anonymity, fungility, transaction speed, and cheaper transactions. BCash could be a layer in it, all they have to do is establish an atomic swap between Bitcoin and wait as decentralized marketplaces emerge, then end user function built increasingly reliant on features from both protocols. That's effectively what Litecoin is doing. Off chain resources like lightning don't use a blockchain other than the one they publish to to open and close channels. The truth is no one knows how decentralized the lightning network will be in a given moment. There are 4 factors which will measure lightnings decentralization.
1. The number of its nodes
2. The independence of its nodes
3. The geographic distribution of its nodes
4. The decentralization of Bitcoin
Because Lightning doesn't have a blockchain and relies entirely on Bitcoin for PoW it can scale! Solving the blockchain scaling problem is most brilliantly solved by not scaling a blockchain! Instead we can insert Bitcoin into a potentially decentralized protocols security model where PoW would otherwise be and instead Bitcoin can at as the security of its state.
So I understand why you are frustrated as an end user. You want a function and to you these seem like reasonable sacrifices. **Bitcoin is the money of the future**, it's even the money of right now to a degree. You might as well be telling an early computer scientist that getting computers to talk to each other is obtuse as imaginable and will never catch on. You aren't wrong, you just aren't seeing the bigger picture.
Edit: Now that you've really got me thinking about it you don't ever trust lightning nodes. The first 3 factors only affect the ability for information gathering or at bare minimum node numbers channel availability. With the total lack of ability to steal funds or impact the lower network under any circumstances the impact of decentralization is very different, mostly observational like TOR.

Wait, are you telling me that unless Core proposes an immediate block size increase that there must not be support for a blocksize increase among Core developers?
Many do support such an increase, many don't. Most don't believe it's life or death either way, but if you participated at all in the Core development process you would know they don't introduce consensus changes. They expect the community to introduce and evaluate such changes. More than that, Core runs on the same principles as does the IETF. They are a conservative body which doesn't push forward improvements or changes if there is any significant unaddressed dissent. These are things you'd know if you read those news letters. There is no increase planned because from a technical perspective they are fairly difficult to justify it he context of the current road map. Only when you start thinking about user experience and quality of life does the current congestion become immediately pressing - and the community had their chance with 2x to do something about it.

It's absolutely not binary, which is why I use the phrase "first and most decentralized". I understand you're embarrassed about not understanding that torrents are a distributed protocol not a decentralized one, but trying to condescend back at me isn't a productive method of making your point. Trackers get shut down all the time every year, that's a fact. When they do their torrents become unavailable. They only exist in safe havens that allow them and their purpose is as authority figures in the protocol. Bitcoin is trustless. There is no such authority figure or lynch pin that can take down entire segments or functionalities of the network. It's the difference between distributed and decentralized.

You're largely correct. Assuming you had kept your seed words but lost your channel state and backups and weren't sharing the latest channel state with a watchtower you are reliant on the other party to honestly close the channel. If they don't you could possibly lose funds because you lack the resources required to create a justice transaction.
You could also lose funds by creating a closing transaction without the most recent state and being subject to your channel peers justice transaction.

Not true. No other crpytocurrencies prioritize decentralization the way Bitcoin does, which is the singular principle which enables individual financial sovereignty. Every single one of them sacrifices degrees of decentralization for features and functionality. Someone is asking why bitcoin won't lose out to more feature rich coins? The answer is because those features are mutually exclusive with decentralization. This is why we intend to build in layers.
More over no other cryptocurrency has comparable market liquidity. Has comparable attack cost. More well tested reliability. It is by far the better of its competitors in this use case of being your own bank. 
It's this same reason why altcoins and private blockchains are going to eventually migrate in favor of L2+ protocols. None of the existing private blockchains or altcoins resolve to the most decentralized network on the planet. The credibility of their state, their interoperability with other members of the protocol stack, these will be the features which bring altcoins back home. Atomic swaps make me all kinds of hot and bothered.
We're going to end up with an interwoven protocol web, enabling functionality of all kinds imaginable. The entire cryptocurrency community is going to have benefited from their parallel development and solving of individual problems as we enable sophisticated end user functionality by building smart contracts to bridge these networks.

No. You and a few other people have a major issue. Bitcoin works perfectly for me.


Bitcoin has a 10 minute minimum delay for commerce and a natural minimum transaction value. I continue to use bitcoin for appropriate transactions i.e. not buying coffee.


This is the absolutely insane part of this argument. I've never paid a $10 fee in my life. YOU CHOOSE THE FEE. How entitled is it to proclaim "My use case is the most important and thus all my transactions must settle before anyone else - *but it has to be cheap because even though my transactions are way more important than other use cases I'm unwilling to pay for it*"


Cryptos already fill the voids Bitcoin leaves but they don't do the same job of decentralization. Trying to compete on a fee level with effectively centralized services is impossible ad would be self destructive to the one property they can't out compete us on. We are the most valuable blockchain in the world. Demand has consequences.
People who think about this problem the way you do are wrong to believe bitcoins use to buy coffee is an all or nothing value proposition. The vast majority of use cases do not require microtransactions or super low fees. We are building a framework to support additional use cases such as those you desire, but to pretend that those use cases are bitcoins primary function or value is absurd.
More than all of this the gall of the community to proclaim themselves as experts in this field, engineers able to evaluate and scale a first of its kind decentralized global network. Do you have any appreciation for how nuts this now THREE YEAR long conversation is? Why does every joe-blow think they are even qualified to comment on these proposals let alone insist on their passage? This is not how scaling conversations go on the mailing list and for very good reason.

Concerted by a few maybe. Many peoples primary objection to the NYA was the way it was proposed - birthed in a back room with a handful of large companies CEOs. It is antithetical to Bitcoin and certainly to its consensus. These companies did not devote any developer resources to the problem, they did not seek input from the reference implementation developers, they dictated to a group of passionate anti-establishment volunteers participating in a  decentralized network how they were going to build their network. That some number became passionately opposed is no real surprise. The other major objection was the timetable was created entirely without developer input. We saw the results when it launched. It wasn't a responsible agreement. It was a bad idea. We're still rolling out support for segwit and you want to add a testing schedule for a major hard fork on top of that? I can see why it failed.

Decentralization is a measure of the cost to disable an authority-less distributed network. Bitcoin is more decentralized because it has a large number of independent, distributed, politically aware nodes and miners. The cost to control or attack the majority of the nodes and miners is the measure of each Bitcoin and Litecoins decentralization. Bitcoins more expensive asic mining environment makes these costs to attack higher than the comparable cost of a virus or the requisite GPU farm.

While I think there are some basic principles everyone should follow like not investing money you can't afford to lose, we aren't playing the same game. You're trading an investment. I'm part of an open source community and network protocol that I happen to be invested in. You think of things like buying low and selling high, you think of market share and valuation - and I think about things like node distribution and schnorr signatures. You judge me and my peers by your standards but that doesn't impact us because we're playing an entirely different game than you are with different end goals and priorities.
You would sell at 1000's of percent gains in anything, any rational person making decisions based on their quality as an investment would. I would. The bitcoin investors who sold have. This is why you think the market is irrational. You have no other available way to shape your thoughts about bitcoin than as an investment. 
I'm a software engineer, I think about it as a technology not an investment. For me in the most immediate context that technology is being my own bank. I only sell what I need to, much as money only leaves your savings account when you spend it. I was happy with the price at $200, I'll be happy with the price wherever it is tomorrow. So long as I'm happy with the technology I'm not selling, I'm in an accumulating and saving phase of my life. Even right now Bitcoin allows me to act as my own financial agent with financial sovereignty. I have observed its value and functions grow over time. It's the first deflationary currency on a global stage. It's the first and most decentralized network - possibly the only one the planet will ever be able to afford to have. The end user functionality which could be built on this platform is near endless. You fantasize about disrupting an industry and getting in early? I fantasize about a technology like the internet, being able to disrupt almost every industry. Owning Bitcoin is like owning part of the network topology of the internet since it's the only way to utilize the network.
So yeah, you think my perspective is really funny - I think your perspective is really funny, and we both think we're experts in what we're talking about. But we're talking about two totally different things. Is there a lot you could teach us all about trading? I'm sure there is. But is that really relevant to what we're doing here? I don't need to be an expert trader to either make money from bitcoin as an investment or participate in it as a technology.  To me it looks like a bunch of financial professionals talking about things they don't really understand, and consequently can't possibly be expected to accurately value, while authoritatively giving advice in an inherently authority-less environment. Can you imagine why that looks so funny to us? It's almost as funny as the people who view Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme or their opportunity to learn how to day trade and immediately lose their nut. This got long winded and off topic. I'm done raving now.

Fees are right now nuts, yep. Do I think it's good or bad for bitcoin? Bitcoin is a protocol. I don't think it impacts Bitcoin. It's probably bad for public adoption but I'm not an expert on that nor is that my immediate concern. Would I personally like to see them lower for my own use? Absolutely, and I see a path forward for lower fee transactions in layer 2 solutions. But I would rather pay near any fee than give up Bitcoins decentralization. Bitcoin could go years with "unaffordable" fees and still be the most decentralized network on the planet.


Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized network. All other functions, be they as a cash transaction system, a settlement system, digital gold, triple entry accounting, traditional market hedge, being your own bank - or *anything* else that bitcoin exists as an end use to users flows directly from decentralization. We *cannot* throw away decentralization because the fees have become too high for many use cases. It's regrettable, but it's necessary. Just like every other protocol ever to adopt widespread success we intend to build in layers so that all these desirable functions can be met with separate and modular concern. It is entirely impractical that 10 years from now every user in the world records their coffee transactions and reddit tips in the worlds decentralized blockchain. That will necessarily centralize it and ruin everything we've worked towards.

Thinking the ratio of "users" (I assume you mean SPV users, or exchange users) to nodes has anything to do with decentralization is just more stupidity. Everything you say betrays your misunderstanding of what decentralization is. There is no difference in decentralization between a network with 10 nodes and 1 million "users"  and a network with 10 nodes and 10 users. Again, this is *basic*, rudimentary. We can verify this because to disrupt the network requires the same work - i.e. disrupting 10 nodes. Since the work to disrupt both networks is identical then we can confidently say they are equally centralized.

Because Ethereum as a network doesn't care about exploding resource costs, which inevitably lead to centralization. Their resource costs already eclipse Bitcoin despite being around a fraction of the time. It's not sustainable as a decentralized service, it will eventually exist in a handful of major datacenters and that will be the entire network backbone. All it will take to shut down ethereum at that point is to make it illegal or attack those handful of data centers. They won't be decentralized enough to resist attacks.

I know I will be throwing up a lightning node with a few BTC just because it will earn something as opposed to sitting stagnant and I'd rather be earning via lightning than coinjoin, which is my only other realistic option currently.

There is still an association with success and profit, private companies don't fund open source projects that aren't making them any money.

They don't resonate with those of us who still view Bitcoin as a protocol and software development project. What is important to us is the function of the project - which is the world's first and most decentralized network. Things like price and adoption are nice, even important when they relate to the function of the project, but not a significant concern otherwise. Bitcoin functions at $1 per coin and at $20k per coin as a decentralized network and fungible token. That's what is important. From there we can build all these end user desires like cheap transactions and zero knowledge transactions on top. The last thing we want to do is sacrifice what makes Bitcoin unique among cryptocurrencies in a vain attempt to draw users or inflate the price. Then we are just PayPal. It may be in some people financial interests to build PayPal 2.0 but that's not what interests the Core development team or many in the userbase. We're all thinking about 10, 20 years from now not tomorrow.

A lot of us saying hold are doing so because:
* we see this technology as a protocol with a unique and optimistic future not a price tag
* we've experienced multi year bear markets and losses greater than this
* we have been warning everyone who enters the market to expect wild fluctuations up and down
If you can't handle this you shouldn't be in this game in the first place and probably should sell, you're gambling with money you can't afford to lose which is rule  even stickied to the top of this sub. I can't imagine what small percentage of the bitcoin population hasn't heard the disclaimers which have been the focus of every bit of mainstream reporting and word of mouth discussion about bitcoin for years now. I would expect the vast majority to know exactly what they signed up for, including the possibility that the price could again be what it was 3 weeks ago. They should hold. What was the point of even buying in if you're going to sell at the first major and inevitable dip? That's just a near guaranteed loss.

[Rsk]( is currently centralized in part. The Bitcoin peg is accomplished via a federation of bitcoin companies. Once [BIP 118]( passes - sighash_noinput - it will enable a lot of upgrades to layered services. One of those upgrades is SPV proof sidechain pegs - meaning a proof of the peg can exist without anyone facilitating it. SPV's are what enable light clients like on your phone to work at the moment without being a full node. Another is [eltoo,]( the lighting upgrade which enables a simpler anti fraud model by invalidating previous states.

I read the report, and it was actually very bearish on almost all offerings on the basis that their use cases didn't have a real market of significance. It suggested near every alt would be down or dead except BTC, XMR, and DCR. I don't agree with those last two. The report didn't give any thought to features or layers that haven't been meaningfully deployed yet on top of bitcoin.
The methodologies they used were three different and generally accepted means of establishing the value of a traditional network: 
* Top Down: using the quantity theory of money to deduce
the value of cryptoassets needed to support a forecasted
* Peer-Based: using multiples of network-specific metrics to
arrive at relative valuations
* Bottom-Up: using discounted cash flow models to
estimate value of networks that provide yield
They covered an enormous amount of the crypto space and shit on 99% of it. Cast your disagreements with it if you like - I have mine - but at least read the report.

I am asserting the US likes to pressure countries through trade deals to adopt US regulation, oversight, and law. An example is the way they shoehorned copyright into the TPP - which was removed after they dropped out. Another example the way they forced countries like Switzerland to report all their banking customers or be blackballed from international finance.
It's an obvious encroachment on other countries sovereignty. It's plain bullying.
Do I think that US copyright law is in any way reasonable? Not at all. The length of time things are copyright is insane and there aren't even the most simple of provisions allowing the violating of patents to for example support generic prescription drug markets, a pretty important thing for every other country in the world shouldering health care systems. Also kiss the free use of copyright material by the state owned media goodbye, like the BBC.

I think you're wrong about what percentage of bitcoin is in the hands of people like us, or what percentage of the community is people like us. I also think neither of us is especially unique. If we're capable of seeing the future of trust then so can others, especially as that future matures and comes closer to end users. That's why I'm out here talking about what I see, much as I assume you are. I wouldn't be here talking if I thought it was all falling entirely on deaf ears. Many of us who are intimate with the details of the protocol implementation have an insight to share, be it with get rich quick schemers, altcoin advocates, or wallstreet pessimists. How many people do you imagine originally dismissed bitcoin only to turn around after multiple conversations and research? I view these conversations as important because while I disagree with your estimates, I agree there are a lot of people involved in bitcoin who don't see it as a technology.

If we wanted money and we know its volatile why haven't we all cashed out while we have lots of money? I've been in for 5 years and I'm not even considering selling for another 4 - post halving. I'm a software engineer. I see a technology not a price. A lot of us are tech enthusiasts its what brought us here. One of dozens of 35% plus dips doesn't impact the reasons we are invested at all, nor does 1000's of percent increase. I'll leave when I dislike the projects technical direction or don't see its possibilities to improve the future. It's the same reason the Bcash supporters left. They disliked the technical direction, they didn't care too much that it was fucking them in price. If they did they would have come back. Price is not a significant factor for us long term holders deciding to keep our coins. If it was we would have sold long ago. There is no rational person who is considering price in deciding to hold or not that doesn't sell at 1000's of percent gain. It's why everyone on the outside looking in thinks it's a cult, they only see the irrationality of the decisions being made around price. They have no understanding of the technology or what kind of future bitcoin holders see as being uniquely possible for the first time.

Who has EVER said it's a binary state? I have explicitly told you repeatedly in this conversation it isn't, you're arguing with a strawman. Since you can't read I'll quote one of the many times I've said as much.


More independent nodes and miners of a higher distribution increases the cost to attack the network. "Users" as you call them don't fit into the equation.
When you assert bcash and bitcoin are equally centralized do the exact same test I did in the hypothetical. How many nodes, are they of equal distribution, how many miners, are they of equal distribution and independence. You tell me - are those things equal across networks?
My explanation has been entirely consistent, you lack reading comprehension. More than that you expect an entire introductory class to networks and topology in a reddit comment. You are so lost down the rabbit hole of reacting to being lectured that you have no idea what you're even talking about anymore. The ironies of calling me the insulting one or having inconsistencies in this conversation are plentiful. You are truly a magnificent ignorant mouth piece and while it's been fun embarrassing you I have more than taught you enough.

For many of us regurgitating the same Andreas talks and the same "vital information" over and over serves no purpose. We are now a broad community of enthusiasts and professionals, I don't think it's abnormal for the content the community discusses and generates to be similarly broad. Some content is only relevant to new users, some talks about current tech, some talks about past tech, some talks about community drama, and a lot talks about price. Since price is the only thing that equally impacts all of our broad userbase it doesn't seem surprising that it acts as the lowest common denominator of community discussion.

Open source software development doesn't traditionally include a PR campaign. Not only is that not part of the job, it's an entirely different skill set. I don't expect top tier software engineers to be personable or well tempered. That's why it's up to people like you and I who are fluent enough with the technical details to talk about them and the future. We are in a small way contributing to consensus with conversations like these. It is becoming increasingly clear that a decentralized security model relies on the education and involvement of the userbase. We need an education campaign, and I don't think it's reasonable to ask the Core devs to be the ones doing it.
The open source software development process is absolutely not a black box. It is entirely transparent. I strongly suggest reading or participating in the IRC meetings and the github repo.

You're going to have to get comfortable with the idea that Bitcoin cannot be everything, especially not immediately. Every altcoin to date sacrifices our key feature - decentralization - in exchange for functionality. Some of those functionalities are amazing and well worth losing decentralization for if absolutely necessary, *especially if a more decentralized network already exists*. Ethereum is a great platform but relative to Bitcoin it is much more centralized. It has a direct leadership, they have abandoned their code is law mantra, its orphan and block rate are unbelievable, their node resource cost is exploding. It is necessarily more centralized or it can't perform its function. That's not a bad thing. Decentralization is not an absolute state and every possible degree of it is not needed for every job.
But if you could have decentralization or at least increase a given chain's without sacrificing function, wouldn't that be nice? That's why we need layers. Bitcoin does this one core, fundamental job of decentralization well, and if we then interface with the rest of the altcoin and sidechain protocol stack which can benefit from bitcoins features and bitcoin from theirs. Things like atomic swaps are the first hints of that coming. Swaps to on chain and off chain resources are going to enable every scripting language compatible altcoin feature that has been built in parallel to bitcoin *through* bitcoin.
You think of this as divide and conquer in a public market and mind share fight. Maybe it is, but that's not where the war for value is won or lost in this unique case. The reality is it's an entire open source space developing an amazing future in parallel, and someday many of the pieces of that future are going to come together like portions of a puzzle. It's good for Bitcoin, it'll be good for some altcoins, it'll be good for some sidechains. There will be winners and losers. Because I know decentralization will be the key functionality separating this entire crypto space from its centralized and more mature competitors - for they are otherwise identical - I know the most decentralized coin will be fundamental to this future space as it grows and intertwines.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:38:49


If you read beyond that sentence you quoted to the next one...


Decentralization isn't a binary state, it is a gradient. We should always strive for as much as is possible. Any changes which will clearly result in a future where it is only viable to participate in the bitcoin network from a major datacenter at immense cost is centralization. I.E. Craig Wrights $20k node vision. When the decentralization gradient crosses from "potential future where bitcoin is illegal and still running" to "potential future where bitcoin is illegal and gets shut down in a day" you are no longer talking about a decentralized future. That is black and white. We want one and not the other.

The fees are taken on the total traded value or the notional value. I.e. a $10 leveraged to $100 (10x) market buy on XBTUSD Perpetual will havea 0.750% fee applied to $100, the notional value of the position (plus if you hold through a funding period whatever the funding fee is at the time which could be positive or negative - again applied to notional value)

You are so right. Being as I currently work with a financial services provider I can tell you 99% of these compromised services are compromised due entirely to negligence. Not doing maintenance, not keeping abreast of patches and vulnerabilities, not using proper access controls - it's absolutely terrifying. I asked a client of mine at one point who was disregarding weekly maintenance due to cost and the time spent offline what their plan was for the event of a  very likely data breach. They said "this is what we have the disclaimers and terms of service for, don't worry about it". I can't even continue typing about it without smashing keys on my keyboard.
Thankfully the attack surface of hosting solely a lightning node can be severely limited. I know I'll be managing my own hardware locally, blocking any and all traffic to every port that isn't lightning itself. With proper access control, routine maintenance, and a professional life which mandates a familiarity with emergent threats I feel pretty safe.
This is why I love bitcoin. I feel in control of my own destiny.

It is entirely unreasonable to expect foreign entities to follow your regulations. If you don't want people in your country accessing certain websites, block them yourself. The onus of responsibility should be on the country trying to enforce regulations internationally.
Just imagine for ten seconds everyone behaved the way the US is on the international stage. Would any company reasonably be able to follow all those conditions from foreign governments,  and as important should they have to?

Name a mechanism by which they could crush the hundred thousand node operators and billions of dollars in miners or otherwise subvert the protocol. Banning it affects nothing but price, and probably not in the way you expect. Bitcoin has yet to penetrate 98% of US held offshore holdings. As soon as you ban it and it keeps running it becomes a living proof that governments interference has little impact and validates many illegal use cases.

Absolutely. If you aren't prepared to secure a hot wallet and then broadcast to the world the target on your back then you shouldn't be hosting a lightning node. With over a decades experience in sysops I'm familiar with the steps required to secure such a hot wallet. You are 100% right to warn that running a hot wallet is an entirely different security risk set then signing transactions offline and not something to be taken lightly.
That all disclaimed I think a good number of us here are technically inclined. Securing a hot wallet requires constant diligence and care, but it's not rocket science. I'm willing to bet there are more than a few of us who are already securing hot wallets for various purposes ready to host LN nodes.

If r/bitcoin as a community wants to take on the job of education I think that's a fairly important job and someone has to do it, but to present it in a top down manner like a sticky maybe isn't the right way to do it. I think it should be a more community driven initiative than theymos/bashco driven initiative.  I know we already have several recap and bestof weekly threads and larger community happenings, maybe we should start something similar with a weekly thread highlighting particularly insightful comments or resources submitted by the community, or maybe a weekly chapter read along and discussion of Andreas' Mastering Bitcoin. Then we would also be addressing the clear demand there is for more substantive discussions while we educate.

"announced such"? In your mind do the Core developers collectively have one will? BlueMatt is a mjaor contributor and he literally extolled on December 18th for 30 minutes how 2mb blocks wouldn't have been the death of the network. This has been so discussed to death that pretending "core" is an entity with a singular position is beyond disingenuous, so many people have talked about their opinions on the matter publicly.
Also as was clearly demonstrated recently miners are not the only network security agents. Nodes play a meaningful role. You can't claim 2x is an example of how miner centralization is bad when the reality is that near 100% of miners wanted to do something and the community of node runners intervened.

If you think the reinvention of trust and finance isn't going to cause immense change you don't understand what Bitcoin accomplishes.

How is adopting a technology and participating in a protocol a cult? Just because we see something you can't understand doesn't make it a cult. It's not irrational, it's not absolute. There are technology related reasons that would make me leave just as those involved in Bcash did. Just because your world revolves around price and mine doesn't isn't a reason to believe I'm in a cult. A cult is an irrational group think, not an individual estimation of the impact a technology could have based on decades of professional experience in a field and an active use of that technology in the here and now. You can't wrap your head around something, that doesn't make it irrational. Pretty much every time there is a major paradigm shift due to technological advancement people unfamiliar with the intricacies of the new technology have difficulty wrapping their head around it. Electricity adopters were not a cult. The internet is not a cult. Bitcoin is not a cult.
You are a rational person. People making decisions you cannot rationalize means they must either be irrational or know something you don't. We know something you don't. Keep telling yourself we are irrational if you want, but you are only denying yourself the opportunity to be involved in a new frontier of protocol consensus.

No, that is a pretty stupid statement. A blockchain is the most inefficient data storage mechanism possible. The ONLY valid use for one is as part of a decentralized security model.

Since Bitcoin is the only decentralized security model with a significant cost to attack, the only use for a blockchain is Bitcoin.

Pretty shallow view of the situation. There have been many people, myself included, arguing that we currently exist in a state of centralization due to Chinese miners which would be disrupted by a block size increase via poor Chinese connectivity. Maybe less total nodes, but more decentralization. It's not as plainly stated "Bigger Blocks == Less full-nodes == More centralization", that's an overly simplistic description of the situation.
If anything I'm inclined to believe that the central points of authority in the social sphere of bitcoin have been paid to influence the discussion. It would certainly be a lot more bang for the governments buck than trying to pay a legion of angry users, and a lot less risk that the subterfuge would come to light too.

You just described a centralized entity creating a distributed network. Congratulations. Is everyone doing the same work over and over or is everyone doing little bits and pieces of the work? This is computer science 101. I cannot possibly make the distinction any clearer. 
Nodes and node distribution are a huge part of decentralization in the Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash networks, by what justification do you dismiss their role as verification and storage agents on the network? It's actually crazy how confident you are despite repeatedly demonstrating you don't know what you are talking about.
Bitcoin core is the most diverse and populous dev team in this space. That is a statistical fact. Don't believe me? Check the repo stats. Compare with any other number of implementations. It is literally plain as day.
It's really really wierd how you are so passionate about things you clearly don't understand. Objective factual things like the difference between decentralization vs distributed, how the torrent protocol works, who participates in the development of a given client, whether nodes matter to these protocols or not.

Personal responsibility and human memory are the mechanisms at play here. You keep dreaming of a future where these problems are solved because to you it is all as magical and inexplicable as an automated room cleaning.

It is harmful to a decentralized ecosystem to have a company position itself as functionally necessary and skim 20% of all fees off the top of all transactions. PoW is an economic security model running on incentives, and RSK is by design reducing the incentives to security actors by 20%. It will necessarily have difficulty competing with any drivechain that is truly open and competitive.

You could either a) get paid directly on chain without lightning or b) do a submarine swap on chain from a lightning invoice if you HAD to use lightning.

What? That makes no sense. If I send a deposit to an exchange, make a trade, then withdraw to a new address - no address reuse - it would appear as an address with no outputs.
If I even make a trade at an exchange, am given a deposit address that is solely for my use (like at bitmex) and trade for several months without losses my address may very likely appear with no outputs.
There are a million reasons for an address to have no outputs and it certainly doesn't imply a lack of use.

You are all opinions. Nothing you say you support, you just say it again.
There is everything valid about saying an ETF isn't a bitcoin use case at all. Users of the ETF or Coinbase or any custodial entity are not using Bitcoin. They interact with no protocol and the interact with no token. Coinbase user use coinbasebucks, etf users use etfbucks. Neither uses or interacts in any way with Bitcoin the p2p network or token until they withdraw into their own wallet.

Minority algorithm coins are ridiculous insecure, that's true. They can be attacked at a whim by the existing majority.
Altcoins with the majority of the hashing power devoted to their algorithm however still have problems. While you can say for certainty that Bitcoin consumes the vast majority of all possible SHA256 hashing power in the world - even that not intended or being used for mining - you can't say the same for other algorithms especially those that are ASIC resistant. There is so much general purpose hardware that isn't mining litecoin or ethereum in the world right now. In the same way that BTC miners pose an existential threat to any other minority SHA256 coin because they could at will attack, the existence of so much general processing power not being used to mine any specific alt means there is the constant threat of unseen and unknown hashing capacity.  You will never see a botnet that is able to attack bitcoin from unsuspecting users computers because all the consumer hardware in the world is a negligible addition to the hashpower. That's just not a threat Bitcoin faces. You can't say the same for any ASIC resistant algorithm. There is an enormous quantity of unapplied hashing power existing in the world for those algorithms.
Even if the above wasn't the case we are talking about economic security models and the most inefficient data structure on the planet; we only really need one. Which one do you think we should use? I think we should use the one that's factors of 10 more expensive if we want economic security.

It's more notable than "BITMEX USES 100X LEVERAGE AND IT'S EXPLOITATIVE!"
The trade fees go to the makers minus the settlement fee if any on the product. Some products have an even higher maker fee than taker fee and no settlement fee to promote market making, while others have equal maker and taker fees. Those fees have been fluid for Bitmexs history and are different for each orderbook because each orderbooks demand and available limit orders are different. The different fee structures are used to attempt to balance the number of takers and makers on the market to create a healthy orderbook.

It is for gaining the properties of Bitcoins decentralized security model.

None of those things are relevant to the solutions you should be pursuing.
Who is talking about private blockchains? No one, it's a total misnomer.

Hmmm. That might be true. Wouldn't you need to look at where most nodes are operating? If Chinese nodes outnumber non-Chinese nodes then maybe you're right and bigger blocks just result in more centralization as blocks mined from outside China are slower to propagate to the majority of nodes. If however the majority of nodes are outside of China and separated from the majority of the hashing power I would think that would give the non-Chinese minority hashing power a slight propagation advantage to the majority of nodes - which would make you wrong as it would increase decentralization. You've given me something to think about there.

When the government gets to decide who is and isn't a terrorist it becomes very difficult to draw a clean line between the good guys and the bad guys. What's a terrorist but a rebel by a different name? Are the Kurds terrorists or rebels? What about Julian Assange - terrorist or rebel? What about Catalonia activist groups? Ukrainian independence seekers? Terrorism is very frequently a matter of perspective. Objectively speaking the United States has funded many terror groups when it suites their needs so its obviously not black and white. I don't believe in allowing the government to make moral decisions on my behalf under threat of life imprisonment or poverty. My own moral compass will inform me of who the bad guys and the good guys are, not the governments, and the fact the government would use threats of force to coerce my position doesn't make them look like the good guys they inherently paint themselves as.

Decentralization is the big get in this space. It is the *only* thing that separates these solutions from traditional more mature ones. If we have a decentralized platform to build the future of functionality on we can kill the business of middle men of trust. Sacrificing decentralization for features is trying to out compete traditional companies doing the same thing on their own turf. If we save decentralization now we can build more features on top of it later. Putting the features first before decentralization is nothing but greed and irresponsibility. People taking advantage of short term gains at the expense of the future of this entire space.
Bitcoin is the most secure, the most developed, the most decentralized blockchain in this space. I will follow those attributes and preserve them wherever they lead me.
We've also got first movers advantage, the fact that we're the base currency in the entire space and everything is traded against bitcoin, the brand, and an unbelievable amount of hype.

It is sad that you decided to write this article without a clue what you are talking about.
For one, you act like you just realized 100x margin is exploitive gambling. The real notable thing here should be how Hayes was damning against okcasino for the same leverage before adopting it himself.
For two, you misattribute the fees as going to Bitmex. They go to makers.

@_date: 2018-09-18 23:52:26
Auto deleveraging is when a position is force closed because the available margin is equal to or less than the fees and losses the position has incurred.
There is nothing crazy about that. It is a normal liquidation of a losing position. The problem is with markets as volatile as those listed on Bitmex there is often no liquidity at the force closed price because a rapid price movement is underway. A position is say force closed at $6000 as the price is rapidly falling to $5500 - those liquidated orders sit at $6000 with no one dumb enough to take them as the market has moved far past them. The only thing that can be done is force close the position at market even if the margin on the position won't cover those losses.
So what is BitMex to do? They don't want to be on the losing end of these degenerate gamblers they enable, so part of the fees they take go to an insurance fund. The uncovered losses come out of that fund for each product. But what happens when the fund is emptied?
That's when ADL happens. A profitable trader will be force closed out of their position at a potentially unfavorable price to buy up the losers contracts at $6000 so Bitmex doesn't have to experience any losses. This is the part people like me take exception to, because with the insurance funds shrouded in secrecy (so as not to be taken advantage of by same degenerate gamblers looking to subsidize their losses) you can never know your risk as a profitable trader of being ADLed. They grade each position in real time on its likelihood on being ADLed, but the resolution is very poor and one of only 5 states. If you are say hedging - where your position in one product is covering a position in another product an ADL on even a profitable position can result in devastating losses.

Over three. What you aren't understanding is the massive amount of foundational protocol work that goes into that and the sheer number of man hours involved.
When someone is getting paid because you bought their token you can bet they will build any given shitty thing in a slapdash hurry, borrowing code from every corner of open source to do it, and then loudly exclaim how great it is so you buy more. That's what altcoins are. You think they are writing 99% of that code? Nope. It is all downstream reuse.
The same reason start up development times are a lot less than they were ten years ago. Better foundations to build on and already built code to use. That's what devs in this space build, and it’s what devs shilling alts use to trick you into thinking they can make a working coin.

Since you're such a pro with the quote tool feel free to use it where you explain that censorship improves discussion.


I see you edited a comment in about r/science that I missed, but I see no reason to make the equivocation that banning laymen answering of question is equal to banning those who disagree about bitcoinxt being an altcoin. The situations are entirely dissimilar primarily because bitcoinxt is advocated by many who are not laymen. So no, I don't consider that an explanation of why censorship is a tool to foster discussion as used in r/bitcoin. Banning people trying to discuss things is not fostering discussion, literally.


You keep definitely and without merit disregarding all posts from these subreddits as low quality. Unless you're prepared to defend your definition of low quality and compare it to current front page bitcoin content this argument is toothless. In fact there have been a number of highly upvoted posts on those alternative subreddits applauding the post quality, so clearly quality is subjective.

You seem to view 100% of the bans/leaving as necessary and resent any participation from those members whom you now call brigaders. I resent that attitude as it has unduly segregated this community and stifled discussion. You are wrong about those subs never producing a quality discussion, it's remarkably similar to here in quality terms. Suggesting that censorship is a means to "fostering a community where discussion can occur" is an obvious contradiction - censorship literally is the ceasing of discussion.
So help me understand how censorship == discussion and long time users == brigaders in your world view.

I say "attack" because it is quite obvious transaction volume follows both a political agenda (starting and stopping as political milestones like the NYA are reached) and a transaction structure (many hundreds of inputs, fees which are hundreds of times the value of the transaction) which could only be interpreted as malicious.


I couldn't disagree more. The much more serious affect is the affect on decentralization, not the temporary affect on fees for the duration of an attack. Viability &gt; temporary quality of life issues.


This is outright wrong. There is no limit on the number of transactions you can send, just the number of transactions you can pay for and it is objectively true that filling bcash blocks would be cheaper than filling bitcoin blocks. The objective of such an attack isn't to raise fees, it's to fill blocks. Fees pay miners and reinforce the security of the network.
Bitcoin cash doesn't protect users. The protection of users is a mirage. There is no balance between quality of life and decentralization, it is black and white. Decentralization is the viability of this network as decades of centralized predecessors have shown us as they have been shut down. Quality of life can be addressed through additional layers or other means, decentralization cannot.

Describe the mechanism of them stopping people from using Bitcoin. I'm not deluded, I am quoting literal fact in action right now. Peoples homes are being raided by police, their miners being stolen and they are being thrown in Venezuelan jails or worse.

Banning bitcoin is like banning prostitution. Good fucking luck stopping people from executing math or using their genitals.

Right now your comment is the most controversial in that thread you link. I am saying that changing the sort order did not affect comment scores. You are asserting that changing the sort order did affect comment scores. So you are effectively saying that previous to now your comment was not controversial and not on top when sorted by controversial, and that the controversial sort order itself influenced the voting on your comment to change the comment ordering, placing you on top. Is that correct?
Since I don't have a time machine and didn't save the page a month ago I can't verify whether the controversial sort ordering is responsible for a change in the overall sentiment of your votes - but I do know that the most infamous example of this controversial sort reordering behavior was in [the thread]( in which theymos was heavily downvoted for his exchange with Brian Armstrong and it most certainly did not change voter sentiment. It provoked several new posts upset with theymos for changing the sort order. Voter sentiment is being expressed every day in this subreddit and in every way possible and it's universally negative. It takes some serious mental jumping through hoops to think that changing the sort order on comments is going to affect public sentiment in a positive way when you are surrounded by people doing everything they can to indicate to you that it does not. All it accomplishes is putting positions a minority agree with on top.

Constant appeals to your authority and no justifications for opinions. Why pray tell can you not keep the information you want in a layered protocol with very limited onchain activity?
The whole point of the solution I am pointing out to you is to deal with the limitations on chain. You simply have no idea what you are talking about. Having to pay for their daily expenses using fiat is entirely irrelevant to resolving trusting data onchain using checkpoints, SPVs, using pegs, or even using a drivechain style merge mining if you are that insistent your job needs a blockchain. The point is its Bitcoin or nothing. Paying people with whatever you want, Bitcoin is for trust.
Keep appealing to your authority, I have worked with plenty altcoin communities and built more than my fair share to know you are full of shit. Believe it or not, developing altcoins has no relationship with knowing how to use the right tool for the right job. In fact it is usually the opposite, since altcoins are using the wrong tool for the job.
ANYTHING YOU CAN BUILD AS AN ALTCOIN YOU CAN. BUILD AS LAYERS RESOLVING TO BITCOIN.

Every single one of those applications would be better resolving to Bitcoin as a sidechain or layered protocol. They do not need their own blockchains, most would be best offchain.

I don't deny brigading happens, I deny that it's the reason people downvote posts by mods and those who support their unpopular policies. The new communities are a clear consequence of the non-brigading negativity that exists in this subreddit - the same negativity you wish to explain by brigading. This is probably because 100% of those links you call brigading are from "new communities" forced into existence by theymos insane mod policies. They are pro bitcoin and pro bitcoin discussion - passionate users. They are not some stop by visiting crowd of yahoos looking to manipulate the votes, they are disenfranchised core users. Brigading is not the reason r/bitcoin's mods experiences the negativity they do, all of the negativity is from subscribers and ex subscribers who I think are well within their prerogative to influence the content of this subreddit with votes.
So we disagree on that point - fine. It doesn't matter. Even if brigading had becoming so deleterious and unstoppable, by what means is changing sort order or hiding scores a protection mechanism? It doesn't effectively stop any visiting parties from voting on whatever presupposition they received in the brigading link. The only thing being effectively accomplished is the silencing of r/bitcoin 's own user base, which is exactly what created these new communities and supposed brigading in the first place. 100% of these observations are simply explained by theymos' megalomania, not brigading or outside influences.

We do vote with our feet. We also vote with our words and our votes. Should we limit ourselves to one expression of our dissatisfaction? Your illustration of private property rights are way off base, the moderation team does not own the subreddit. Reddit owns the subreddit. I am not trying to make the case reddit should be a democracy, I am making the case that there is clear evidence that the self aggrandizing behaviour of theymos and his team is alienating users - as evidence by the votes and more, the subscription counts. Many users do not agree that the content marked controversial is of merit as do the moderators. That's just a fact. 
Absolutely no one is making the case theymos isn't welcome to run this place into the ground, we're actively disagreeing though that he should and until every dissenting voice is banned I presume we're free to continue telling the mod team they are doing a horrible job. Looking at the actual content that this moderator felt was so important I am bothered that they feel their judgement is superior to the publics. I see no reason why most people would be more interested in the comments marked controversial instead of the most upvoted, especially when the most upvoted comment thread in this instance has had significant repercussions for a major bitcoin company compared to the average reddit comment.

An expensive PoW algorithm increases the cost to attack. It's important. You don't want a network where the cost to attack is buying out the latest stock in GPUs or renting a botnet.
Do you think it is possible to run the bitcoin network with smaller blocks and high min relay limits either right now or in the envisaged future? I don't. Where as I can see a potential future with 1mb base blocks, even 2mb blocks. I don't see a decentralized future that is possible with 8mb blocks this early in the lifecycle, or with a modus operandi of raising block sizes whenever there is network congestion.
You can't look beyond users to see the impact nodes have on decentralization.  Short sighted users like yourself may only care about fees, but many of the rest of us care primarily about decentralization. We care about the platform of trust which is already shaping the future.

By noting the bitcoin locked up in smart contracts that you have keys for is worth the dollar peg the contract quotes. And when it's not you assume the peg has failed, the peg provider has gone out of business, or any other thing and you simply withdraw your no longer pegged BTC and go about your business.
The only wrong answer here is using old trust models and claiming it is something revolutionary and new. Give me a peg that cannot be seized or censored, and I can audit myself. There is no reason not to other than it's more expensive to peg for the pegging company and implies them giving up significant control over user funds.

Yes, we are both cautioning Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. Too many people losing their ass chasing the price, have to get them out of the mindset of price high or low and get them into the mindset of mitigating trust. If the business community could just get that this is a trust network not an asset they might suddenly see it's value proposition and "backing" as a unit. At the end of the day it is an asset to, an asset that buys the privilege of trusting the world's first and most expensive pay-to-hack distributed ledger. What a unique security model immune to many traditional forms of security breach or mismanagement for a smart contract platform!
First and most base application - financial transactions to enable the Nash equilibrium creating this economic and distributed security model. Next step, building layers on top of that base selectively refering trust - things like escrow, atomic swaps, banking relationships, insurance, digital asset issuance, and a playpen of groundbreaking technologies. Third step, traditional services realize they can integrate layered solutions to accomplish the business tasks they are already performing with less trust, less insurance, less delay, less manpower, and machine operable. They will start backing their services with Bitcoin fiat pegged smart contracts eliminating regulatory and insurance requirements, as well as selectively introducing auditability.

PoW is expensive, we only really need one PoW blockchain on the planet to act as an anchor of decentralized trust.

If the child has a high income and is spending recklessly the tutor has to petition the court to make the income fixed.

Well, RSK isn't a coin. It is a protocol like lightning. It actually uses the entire EVM to run the exact same smart contracts as ethereum except with Bitcoin and using the Bitcoin miners and security model. It's what we call a drivechain, which is a side chain mined by bitcoin miners simultaneously to Bitcoin. It currently has over 60 percent of bitcoin miners mining it and securing it.
So any valid ethereum smart contract is a valid RSK smart contract except it is more scalable as it discards a significant amount of on chain data as temporary,  and enables protocols like lumino compression which boasts enabling billions of smart contract users.
RSK is ethereum as a Bitcoin layer. It won't take the number 2 spot it has no market cap. It is the number 1 spot.

Nope. Play through such an attack on your head, start with the hundreds of millions of dollars in cost building 50% of the current networks ASIC's, then add the cost of electricity. Then factor in the returns -  which if the attack is truly successful should be 12.5 units per 10 minutes of a rapidly collapsing currency. So you've now invested hundreds of millions of dollars for the end goal of destabilizing at best the currency.
Now tell me, does it cost the same hundreds of millions of dollars to rent a GPU botnet? To rent a server farm of GPUs that could represent 50% of *any* GPU currency? The cost to accomplish the same attack is absurdly different.
Seriously, just think through any of the ideas you have to their NEXT step. That's why I have called you short sighted, you have all these ideas but never move beyond their immediate context.


Yep. You heard me say as much too if you read (as well as many core and ex-core developers), what's your point? We did increase the blocksize by about 1.75x with segwit so I don't know what you think is so controversial about the idea that 2mb blocks are safe.

You mistake bitcoin for r/bitcoin. While the technical decisions concerning bitcoin may be guided by a plutocracy, social media discussion is guided by a deranged and misguided dictator. When I say the moderation team is not in keeping with the ideals of bitcoin, I mean to express that bitcoin is both decentralized and censorship resistant - pretty much the exact opposite values as those displayed by the mod team which is very centralized in power and censorship happy. Democracy has nothing to do with it.

No you can't. A blockchain's trust is measured by its immutability. Its immutability is a function of its security model and cost to attack. This is why "blockchain" is worthless and Bitcoin isn't. Blockchain without the incentives or network or participants is nothing.

No, the original whitepaper doesn't specify a cap - much as it doesn't specify many features that were eventually needed. Not that it matters who or when - it matters that it was needed - but to be clear it was Satoshi who included the blocksize cap when the need did arise.
As I have said many times not only in this thread, the original white paper is not a constitution it is not a religious document it is not an articles of incorporation. It is a historic novelty worthy of reverence much as any long-since matured but foundational RFC would be. People who aren't in tech don't seem to get this and are forming a cult around the white paper and satoshi.
The white paper does not reflect a Bitcoin that has ever existed, certainly not one that exists today.
People in the other sub and people disengaged with tech don't get this. To them the whitepaper is the planning document for all to come and the instruction manual for how to operate in the ecosystem. It's really none of those things and was never intended to be. Many of their misunderstandings about proposed upgrades come from the way they think Bitcoin currently works based on a misinterpretation of the whitepaper. These source documents end up being the only technical reading these people do. Lets be honest there are mountains of documents out here you could spend every waking moment reading and researching and still not know everything there is to know about Bitcoin, but it's easier to read a plain english non-technical document published before the network ever existed and pretend you understand Bitcoin.

I think there is obvious financial incentive for companies to advertise Bitcoin access and education but keep all user action isolated to their services. People will always be gullible and be taken advantage of so we can assume these services will always have users. We have already seen the vast damage done to Bitcoins reputation because of shoddy custodial exchanges - even though again these users were not using Bitcoin.
Long term? Bitcoin is going to be the agent of trust baked into every trusting action you take and you will never see it or know of it, much as you don't give a flying fuck about DNS servers. Using Bitcoin as the backing of trust will change the way all financial services operate, the way escrow is accomplished, and will devastate insurance companies and old world agents of trust  All without people ever realizing it, it's just a new kind of "insurance" and the experts they trust are always talking about all this public financial information they audit on the blockchain. Grandma doesn't care or know the difference, but she will be more secure in her relationships of trust regardless.

I'm being a dick because you're being obtuse. You haven't given these problems any thought at all. What, exactly, is keeping you from using the cloud as part of your security apparatus? I use the cloud. I keep hot wallets, cold wallets, and lukewarm wallets. Anyone can.
Your security will only ever be as robust as you enable it to be. When people lose their keys, that's their own fault. When people let others hold their keys, that's their own fault. When people have a hot wallet drained, that's their own fault. What about personal responsibility do you find so offensive? What you want is for it to be easy, idiot proof. It never can or will be. If you want someone else to take responsibility for you then you aren't looking for Bitcoin.
Be as infuriated as you want, play stupid games and you win stupid prizes. The decentralized security model is a philosophy - if you don't follow that philosophy yet engage with bitcoin you are going to have a bad time. Why should anyone - let alone people like me who have spent countless hours educating - feel bad for people who can't follow simple advice and instruction?

Off chain scaling is infinitely superior to on chain scaling. While we are processing instant transactions with full assuredness and in unlimited volume for unfairly cheap fees you can keep posting transactions on chain and waiting ten minutes and paying high fees. Not to mention off chain scaling is more decentralized by merit of not putting additional resource requirements on full nodes.

You can use a house as collateral, and even use the bitcoin blockchain. That's what colored coins or RSK would accomplish - the transfer of the deed and the conditions of that transfer.
The smart contract doesn't kick you out of the house any more than the bank does. You seem to have trouble figuring out what the role of a bank is. The bank takes the deed to the police or a court and gets an order of eviction just as you would if you were the bank.
If you think Bitcoin is a replacement for the courts or the police you're mistaken, it is a replacement for trusting intermediaries - such as a bank.


When you are your own bank you get to decide what the requirements are for you engaging in a financial action. You can use these exact same requirements you cite or any requirements you would like. That's up to you, being your own bank is having control.

It scales with participants. It will scale the moment there is demand, and even if it didn't because say it didn't exist - we have multiple scaling layers. RSK is live and can handle several thousand tps, and with sighash_noinput will become much less trusty. The idea that we couldn't scale to thousands of tps today is just ridiculous. All it takes is demand and people to use the solutions available. Between protocols like lumino and lightning we are ready to scale today, it is just a matter of use and demand. Much as we were ready to scale in December - if people had been using segwit addresses there would have been no fee crisis. It is all about demand and use.

The same way you always have, putting up additional assets as collateral or having an existing relationship with the bank to the point they know you're good for it. This can be done either traditionally or via colored coins or via smart contracts like RSK.

Congratulations. A hot wallet can't be encrypted,  and if it is the software needs access to the encryption to make transactions in the case of a lightning wallet so the encryption is rather moot. An encrypted wallet on an online device without the encryption keys available on the device is more of a lukewarm wallet if I were to give it a name, not a hot wallet. Pretty different security properties and accessibility requirements. A hot wallet is an online wallet able to process transactions, and consequently a major target for theft. Your keys are encrypted and all the information necessary to process transactions isn't available on the device.

Leverage is when a trader trades with more of an asset then they actually have. This can be done by borrowing the asset or in Bitmex's case, simply conceptualizing more asset. In either instance, you can only afford to lose the amount you have in collateral - so once your trade loses your collaterals worth it has to be closed. We call this a liquidation. A liquidated short means someone had to buy back the asset they borrowed or conceptualized at the current price because any more losses wouldn't be covered by the collateral.  In this case 167,222 contracts were bought because someone ran out of collateral, and the collateral was lost and sent to the traders who profited. It could have been as little as 1/100th the actual number of traded contracts worth of collateral.

I know this because it's a fact. There is a dichotomy between centralized money and decentralized money. Centralized money run by major financial institutions in America using American global payments rails are subject to American financial regulations. That means when they decide they don't want to do business with legal marijuana companies or brothels or anything else broadly considered bad for public image they get to freeze their accounts. It's no different from any other dollar you have in a bank or paypal or anything at all.

You're wrong, the evidence is as plain as the volume. For the same reason these ETF rejections happened, no significant volume in the futures market which is regulated and part of surveillance sharing. Saying that the US futures are influencing anything is simply wrong. Okex and Bitmex derivatives have infinitely more sway in the realm of leveraged short selling.
Edit: 
Daily CME futures volume yesterday (Aug 22 2018) across all bitcoin products - 28,050 bitcoin
Daily CBOE futures volume yesterday across all bitcoin products - 962 bitcoin
Total institutional futures volume yesterday: 29,012 bitcoin or $187.591 Million USD @ $6466 (price at time of writing)
Bitmex's is just one company offering futures that dwarfs the institutional futures market.
Over only THREE bitcoin products - less than either institutional organization alone, they did $132 million USD volume on Septembers futures, $52 million USD on Decembers futures, while the rolling perpetual August swap did over 4 billion USD dollars in volume.
There is effectively no volume at all for September, October, and December futures in institutional markets which compose only 5% of the total volume of the institutional exchanges. Those same products on BitMex have literally 20 times more volume and are as large as all the institutional markets combined. Comparing August products to August products is very clear as well. Bitmex alone did MORE THAN FOUR BILLION in USD volume on this same day that all institutional markets did $178 million. End of conversation.

Incoming liquidity is created by creating desirable channels and having low fees.

Does autopilot not consider fees and channel liquidity when making connections? Thank you for the correction on negative fees, if not negative fees then free.

There have been markets to short bitcoin for over the last 5 years. The volume of other futures markets, like Bitmex or okcoin, dwarfs the institutional futures markets. Okcoins quarterly futures see 7 million+ BTC in volume daily. The CME futures which these researchers attribute cause to are trading less than 30k BTC volume daily.

They don't want to optimize. That would be spending money on a suboptimal solution they don't want. It serves their interests better if they don't, despite the fact that a majority of their users are currently BTC.


That's not an optimization, it wouldn't ease payment of fees or anything just change how it is paid and when. The problem is the way they use onchain transactions. They use two of them per payment and have tens of thousands of minor outputs to consolidate. The way their business is setup is greatly advantaged by not having to worry about or experience fee events so it is much better to drive traffic to other coins.

This sort of attack is the kind of attack which becomes more effective the more centralized the mining ecosystem is, and the effect of such an attack would be to strengthen the bitcoin network through increased decentralization.

Anything that directs people to a scam has a negative impact on the community which impacts me. Your scam has had a horrible cost as a whole.
Again, it's not about Litecoin or other cryptos it is the fact that BCH is a very clear scam attempt against BTC users.

It is exactly the opposite of what you say. Blockchain has no valuable properties. It isn't immutable, it is grossly inefficient.  It's gets its valuable properties of immutability from the network participants. This is why every blockchain project is worthless, it is Bitcoin decentralized security model and nash equilibrium which give it's blockchain immutability and a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to effect a temporary window of attack.
What keeps the price from being 0 tomorrow? The same thing securing the network. The nash equilibrium incentives keep miners mining, and they won't sell for a loss so if the price dips too far they clam up supply. This creates a soft price floor around the average cost to mine a bitcoin.  Once the weak hands sell at a loss and all that is left is holding users and miners, the supply and demand equation rebalanced in the favour of demand - which grows in BTC terms as price lowers.

You are unable to describe that usage of your peers or any alternatives for the place of protocol, and if you could as my original comment suggested it wouldn't even matter because I have demonstrated that the word protocol even if it is used incorrectly with bitcoin according to you (it's not) is still being used, thus defining the word as contextually correct.
That's linguistics. At some point in the future you could be right, but you aren't until you demonstrate usage.

It wouldn't matter if it was a true statement - Bitcoin has always been increasingly divergent from the white paper. This appeal to the white paper is such a poor argument, you think when evaluating the merits of a potential technology improvement the process should be to look at the first version of that technology and derive your conclusions from that document? That's insane, it's not how any RFC based process works. Software, protocols especially, evolve. This idea of anything more than respecting an influential paper is madness.

An extra word threw you off that much? Nothing changes the demand side of the equation except the falling price which should naturally increase it. More people willing to buy at 1000 than 10000. Reducing supply should naturally meet then exceed an inherently growing demand. Once you've shook the loose hands you'll have no more BTC on the market to sell, and the same demand that was allowing falling prices with larger supply will enable rising prices with no supply.

Your lnd instance sets the bitcoin.basefee and bitcoin.feerate attributes - which are fees you charge on forwarded transactions i.e. emptying your side of your channels balance into whever you are connected with. It does make it possible for people to drain your channels - which is exactly what you want, your entire float able to be used for incoming payments. Anyone who wants to send you funds still has to pay the fee the routing nodes to you charge, and not your negative fee. We are also talking millisatoshi. Doesn't even need to be negative, just outcompeting other nodes.
If you set those fees to negative and open some large channels you will see many nodes start connect to you and your own channels start to empty. When someone pays you your channels will start to refill, and then immediately empty again as payments are routed through you. Your ideal state as a merchant is many open channels with your side of those channels empty. This maximizes the volume available to be sent to you. As with any business your float size should reflect your transaction volume.

The mental gymnastics required to support BCH are insane. It requires ignoring all the evidence that BTC hasn't been taken over by any party readily available in the git, IRC, and mailing list; it requires a total misunderstanding of the technical properties of segwit and lightning.

The majority of people, if they endorse a provably incorrect belief, will continue to believe in the face of contradicting independent evidence. It takes 3 instances of corrective action to persuade half of the population, and a startling number will not be corrected regardless of the evidence or number of instances.
So yes, people are overwhelmingly bad executors of logic and estimation. They are also conspiratorial. That's why Rogers marketing is as effective as it is, and why Bitcoin supporters have an obligation to present the evidence against these false views wherever appropriate.

This guy thinks these are revelations and damnable but they aren't.
Bitmex has a high product velocity and several very low volume products. They have needed to form relationships with and establish their own market makers to create trading opportunities for these products. As this article points out, these market makers often put themselves in a position of losing money - which is why third party market makers typically pull their orders during periods when they are needed most by the users of the exchange. It makes **perfect sense** why an exchange like theirs would open up an in house market maker who typically loses money. It makes the low volume periods for some instruments a viable trading experience for their users.

I think the community of BCH is paranoid and toxic, prone to conspiracy theory and playing victim.

This seems to be your fundamental misunderstanding. The person in your scenario isn't a bank they are a banking customer. Being a bank means securing and distributing loans not applying for them. No one is claiming using Bitcoin you magically get loans out of thin air or with improper collateral. That's not being your own bank is or means.
If you only have $20,000, that is your banks total deposits. As a bank you can only manage however much money or assets you have (which you can digitally sign and trade using platforms like counterparty). You can only loan out up to $20,000 + assets. I'm a larger bank than that, but being your own bank provides substantial benefits regardless of your capital.
As for a user trying to get a loan from any bank, bitcoin backed or not, they will have to meet certain standards of collateral and repayment terms. That's just a universal truth. Bitcoin nor being your own bank have anything to do with that except now those relationships are executing transparently and automatically where applicable on a blockchain.
Being your own bank means you decide how your money is secured, who you spend it with, and what financial actions you take with it. Including loans and credit. It doesn't mean magically receiving loans or credit but having full control over your relationships with them. Financial independence and automated contract execution.

I agree lets be honest.
Companies have different priorities than users. They dislike premature optimization, the do like reaching as many people as possible, and they do like lower costs of operating.
Blocksize limits and fee markets, however necessary for the maturation of this limited global resource we call the bitcoin blockchain, creates engineering friction and worse - unpredictable cost increases and a disrupted user experience. It's bad for business. We saw hundreds of blockchain companies migrate chains or shut down when fees exploded. There is a strong incentive for these companies to assert influence to suite their needs.
Through this lens it seems obvious why a business like BitPay would support s2x, why nearly all Bitcoin companies came together and unilaterally attempt to change the rules of consensus.
Just in principle, the idea that companies would attempt to unilaterally make a consensus change is offensive to users who value decentralization. So we fought. Users won. No s2x.
This leaves a bitter taste in an executives mouth. Time to hedge our bets. If this blockchain won't provide the free infrastructure we want lets encourage another blockchain which might. So BCH gets integrated, and they expand the blocksize, and the world doesn't come tumbling down. To any executive this sounds like validation. Why bother even optimizing the BTC chain transactions now? You have the network backbone you want to work with, pouring development resources into a network you know won't ever be as cheap is a total waste of time and money. Allow the negative user experience to push transactions towards your preferred and cheaper solution and be done with it.
It just makes no sense to spend money on optimizing BTC transactions.

Each block found every ten minutes extends the blockchain by one. Only the longest chain is valid. If you went back in time 10 thousand blocks and altered a block, you would need to start mining from that altered block with over 50% of the miners to catch up and eventually surpass the original chain you altered. That's what we call a 51% attack. Once your altered chain surpassed the original chain many tens of thousands of blocks later your chain would become the one everyone uses and the other chain would be discarded - as would all the transactions occurring only on it.

Difficulty keeps rising and thus the cost to mine keeps rising despite efficiency gains.
Mining will never be done. When the last coinbase is mined the next block will be mined. The only difference in reward will be a single satoshi. The fees are the vast majority of the reward long before that point. Just as now the cost to mine creates a price floor it will in the distant future.

There has been a ceaseless attack on Bitcoin by institutions it will replace and governments globally for over 5 years. It has caused price losses and slowed adoption. Remember when China was the majority of this market? Or how US/Korean/Japanese/Chinese/Indian regulator FUD is constantly causing wild volatility? Or how Bitcoin is only for criminals? Bitcoin not only has endured these attacks but thrives in this environment. The Nash Equilibrium securing BTC doesn't care what FUD exists, long term the incentives remained aligned for growth. The exploding hashrate (and price) is testimony to that

Who cares if your average mom and pop can't do illegal things. Your average mom and pop don't/can't hire prostitutes but I don't see that multi billion dollar industry vanishing. There is demand for bitcoin regardless of the legislative climate, and if it proves able to resist inhospitable legislative climates (as it is currently doing in china and venezuela) you can expect demand for that unique property to pour into bitcoin.
It's a lose lose scenario for governments as far as they see it. Either ban bitcoin and prove it as the ultimate tool for making monetary legislation unenforceable, or integrate Bitcoin into society and provide a potential off ramp for money supply which could be disastrous during an economic downturn.
The win they don't yet see is that by integrating Bitcoin you engage the Bitcoin economy, and can put that money to use the way a government would typically desire. The only option IMO is integration, anything else is self destructive.

I don't think you know what you're talking about. Quantum computing will disincentivize address reuse but it won't meaningfully affect transaction signing otherwise. It will cause a new generation of miners much like the leap we saw from graphics cards and fpgas to asics. It won't be the death of bitcoin as other signing methods and address types can be adopted, just as segwit address types were adopted.

As a developer, Apple's behavior makes me crazy and always has. "Apps" are a cultural product and have nothing to do with running programs on any device. Remember when we just called it software and companies didn't dictate what software we were allowed to run? Now if you don't launch your software in the app store you have no access to customers. If software met the technical specifications of the device it would run on it. "Apps" are the illusion of ease of accessibility and safety, a process of deferring all judgement about which software to trust to the large companies.
I have no idea why consumers have flocked to this model in droves. I suppose they're scared of things they don't understand, like virus infection and "hackers" as the terms have gained colloquial meaning far detached from reality.
Apples success has cemented this notion of a restrictive marketplace in the business conscious. We're going to be stuck with this reality for a long while.

First of all, you live in a fantasy world of absolute dichotomy. There is no unfettered social dogma, it was a rhetorical question. Every other nation in the world has managed to find an equitable balance between the needs of the collective and the needs of the individual, even the US of A is a far cry from its pre-depression "Wealth of Nations" roots. You live, have probably lived your entire life, in a fantasy. You imagine the world around you as you see fit to aggrandize your accomplishments and justify yourself. The reality is that if you were born into poverty you have statistically no chance of achieving your current success without social assistance that comes from your and my tax dollars.

There are many kinds of bitcoin addresses. Some minority of old addresses, usually used to consume the coinbase transaction when mining new blocks, use their literal public key as part of the address. That means the public key in its raw form exists on the blockchain when a deposit is received to an address of this type. This is called a pay to pubkey address and is distinctly different form a pay to pubkey hash address - which is the kind of address you are likely most familiar with and begins with a 1. Originally the migration from pubkey to pubkey hash addresses was due to size and usability. Hashing the pubkey makes it smaller and encoding it in base58 makes it human readable. It also turns out that hashing the pubkey means the pubkey doesn't exist on the blockchain, and so it incidentally protects almost all users from fund-stealing attacks. The only users affected by a quantum attack will be people who mined a block a very long time ago, used a pay to pubkey address, and lost the key so the funds still sit in that original address. The quantum computers will use the public key to derive the private key and steal the coins.

I do know you are wrong. I can infer it and so can you. 
1. Is it possible for this currency to be decentralized? No, they note it isn't mined and is centrally issued and controlled. 
2. Goldman Sachs has an existing multi billion dollar business reliant on a good relationship with regulators in the US.
3. All the existing friction in the crypto-&gt;fiat-&gt;crypto transition is due to centralized custodial entities a. incompetence and b. following legal regulations.
4. All the available features of this new product are identical to Goldman Sachs existing products.
Conclusion: we do absolutely know that this is both not a cryptocurrency and nothing new or valuable. It cannot possibly enhance the crypto-&gt;fiat movement or visa versa as no mechanism for such an enhancement exists, but all the mechanisms of friction explicitly continue through this product.

It's completely serious. Good for the above poster for trading up, but most people don't - they trade down. Better to not invest more than you can afford to lose and be gambling on whether or not Bitcoin gets adopted long term than gambling that you are a prophet of price and will pick the right moments to buy or sell. To trade is a completely different gamble and risk exposure than to hold.

Like I said, I'm not sure you have the full story. The kind of attack you describe relies on having the public key. Most address formats do not include the public key, but a hash of either the pubkey or a redeem script. That hash isn't quantum vulnerable the same way the raw pubkey is. The raw pubkey only ends up on the blockchain as part of a signature that redeems the locked outputs, so it only is public once the coins are spent. If you don't reuse the address then the pubkeys are never public before being spent and the attack surface of a quantum attack is greatly diminished.

There is nothing wrong with a wallet choosing to support BIP70-72. The thing that BitPay have done wrong is drop support for BIP21. To my knowledge they are the only major service provider that doesn't support BIP21. What motivations could a company the size of BitPay have for dropping BIP21 support? They will necessarily limit their customers to BIP70 supporting wallets. That's a very serious negative and the reason no one has followed BitPays lead.

It's a little sad that the notion of a public ledger is more foreign than a read only spreadsheet - I think public ledger is both simpler and more accurate a description - but I don't think you are alone in your misunderstanding.

People are using ledgers of various sorts in their lives of which a spreadsheet might be one, they just aren't calling them ledgers.

Right, it's about how your http server implimentation handles URI's and knowing that there's a choice means that it depends on the implementation. That means you should expect only literal behavior to be consistent and normalization not to be. I don't understand why this is so hard to explain to you guys,
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:23:15
Because URI's are what HTTP uses to direct you to content. URI's are broader than HTTP, a URI is a file path or a web location or any such pointing. You use URI's every day without even knowing it, and I said HTTP because HTTP implements URI's as addresses - which was the original comments subject. If HTTP didn't implement URI's then this wouldn't be an issue, or if there was a universal implementation. We don't tend to do universal implementations of anything in computer land because no one can agree on anything.

This is totally wrong. Bitcoin is self banking, and describing it as such is the most relatable way to eschew the misconception that it is only a medium of transfer or a store of value. If people viewed bitcoin as self banking they wouldn't trust it on exchanges and would take security more seriously, for one.
To be a store of value, you have to consider the process of storing, securing, and making available that value. I.E. the functions of a bank. It's a virtual currency, sure, but one designed so anyone may act as their own bank. Otherwise you're discarding any benefit of a trustless system.

Are you aware that language is contextually defined? If you're not, I can point you towards some excellent English as a second language courses. Sometimes it can be hard when people use informal definitions, I understand. But if you notice, many of your peers were able to contextualize the word "transparent" to become synonymous with "accessible", based on its application to a software protocol and not some physical, light ignoring material. The mere fact that so many were able to derive a coherent and valid meaning to the sentence where you were not strongly indicates the problem is with your interpretation of the syntax and not the general population or the original comment.
Also, when you are an anti-social prick it makes it more difficult for people to explain why you might be wrong. You are open to the idea you might be wrong, aren't you? Clever man like yourself.

It's more what you see that they don't. If you don't understand Bitcoin is a tool of trust it looks like nothing more than a novel economic experiment in incentives. If you only understand finance and not computer science it looks like an asset in a giant bubble with nothing backing it.
Some very smart people dislike Bitcoin. That doesn't mean they aren't smart. They just lack the cross discipline skillset to understand what Bitcoin accomplishes - which is again trust. Bitcoin accomplishes trust. You don't hack the database you buy temporary write rights and it costs hundreds of millions in hardware. It is the most unique security model that has ever existed to date.

Bitcoin isn't a democracy it's a Nash Equilibrium. You would need to disrupt the equilibrium by messing with the incentives of miners and node runners to convince them to start inflating the currency. As is everyone is getting too good a deal and the risks are too great to change. Even if 99% of users got angry and left, unless they took the entire economic market for Bitcoin with them (technically even if machines were the only ones using Bitcoin it would still be valuable) the incentives to mine Bitcoin would still exist.

And my point is from a programming perspective. You can't expect homogeneous implementation even if it is is defined as such. When it's explicitly defined as NOT homogeneous implementation and people start complaining that things act differently or one way is better than the other, I'm left the obligation to remind you that it's this way for a very good reason and refer you to the documentation.
Using URI normalization as if it were the defacto standard is just going to disappoint you and keep you from hitting the right location. Arguing with me isn't going to change that. Changing the spec isn't going to change that. It's that way for a reason. Your best course is to understand why it is the way it is and never abandon characters in your URI's.

I'm a software developer in the process of doing exactly what you describe, but you have to see that it will quickly become a popularity contest and the allocation of resources will have no relationship to scientific direction. The general public, the people we are trying to facilitate donations from, are the primary obstacle to getting anything constructive done. They donate enmass with complete disproportion to the few - I don't anticipate any relationship between scientific merit and donations since currently I cannot fathom a device to meaningfully direct funding without disinteresting the funding source. People want to donate for what they want to donate, and there's nothing scientific about it. You can make every publishable appeal for funding top-quality, you'll still only see the smallest fraction funded, overwhelmingly over funded sometimes. Laymen do not enjoy reading even the shortest abstract and aren't generally qualified to evaluate it if they did.

You're right, referring to standard URI implimentation as it exists in HTTP use cases directly from the source implementation discussion and identifying the reason there's a disparity in implementation as complained about by the original remark is in no way relevant to the discussion.
Some key bits:


   described by the defining specification for each scheme.
   Implementations may use scheme-specific rules, at further processing
   cost, to reduce the probability of false negatives.
Every implementation is a snowflake. While normalizing URI's is useful for reducing redundancy among web crawlers every URI shouldn't thus be implemented with normalization for trailing slashes.
Or we can bitch and moan about upvotes, whatever. Fact is you should expect a disparity in URI implementation.

I stopped using QuadrigaCX last week after a heated exchange with what I can only assume was a majority of their staff, culminating with their CEO.
For at least the last few weeks their phone didn't work. No ringing, no nothing. I tried to use their contact form but that didnt work either. They didn't notice because they don't have any customer support and no one answering the phone for weeks is completely normal.  I moved close to Quadriga's physical offices so my business could take advantage of arbitrage opportunities by immediately depositing or withdrawing funds. What I found was that any in person meeting took weeks to arrange, and instead of writing a cheque with QuadrigaCX on it and dropping it off at their offices, they had me write the cheque to an individual investor of theirs, Michael Patryn and drop it off at the Vancouver Club.
I mentioned these issues to the CEO, they were dismissed with "we are an online only exchange" despite their still present advertising. Having met the people running Quadriga  I am concerned that they spend enormous sums traveling constantly for their business and no sum supporting it. I don't think this is a ship that is sinking anytime soon but mark my words it will sink.

Aaron isn't in the office, he doesn't leave any notes on the notepad on the door but since we seem to have this confusion you bet I will. Stop fucking assuming and run your business.

Edit: 11:24am - Aaron answered the door this time!!! He then admitted that phones hadn't been working, that the contact form hadn't been working, that his office hours are all over the place, and then kicked me out as he screamed that I didn't have an appointment. He says he is too busy to take any appointments as his work is much too important and then went back into quadrigas offices and locked the door. Still no answer to the phone.

No, you're not understanding. Bitcoin literally is a protocol. That it is a communication protocol is simply categorical as to what types of procedures this protocol contains. It's not a semantic argument, and if it was a semantic argument (I.E. changing language and emergent definitions) you should be demonstrating there is significant usage of a different word or terminology to describe the same protocol.
Even if we were to conclude that there was a more appropriate phrase or terminology, it wouldn't invalidate the still literally correct usage of protocol until such a time as the word protocol stops being used by anyone describing the exact implementation, mechanics, and participation mechanisms of Bitcoin.
As is "protocol" is clearly the most widely used and descriptive definition of what Bitcoin is. I'm not entirely sure what your objection to the term is other than you think people don't understand what a protocol is or it has some unstated negative connotation.

Of course it is platform dependent. It is entirely dependent upon your softwares implementation of HTTP. That the HTTP spec uses URI's and the URI spec itself lays out the many interpretations of URI's leads to the reality that any implementation may normalize or not normalize depending on its needs. This variation, this inconsistency, it's literally in the spec. As a user you should not expect normalization.
TL:DR: Because http.

Most of the people thinking about bitcoin do so as currency. As a developer, I'm shocked that we find ourselves in possession of the only secure and distributed network in existence and all we can think to use it for is consumer fiscal use.
I see a future where major industries are the driving force behind bitcoin and bitcoin expansion. A secure peer driven network is a software development dream - as new technologies like sidechains are developed to store more kinds of data using the blockchain it will be the driving force of the bitcoin economy in a few years. Not consumer use.

Third sentence of the abstract is the first of many mentions of the "peer to peer network" which is the bitcoin protocol. Peer to peer means 2 computers or more. In terms of **how**,  he outlines a very explicit **procedure** involving a chain of related hashes and associated values we've come to call the blockchain which acts as the primary medium of communication storage - his timestamp server. He talks to no end about communicating nodes, cooperating nodes, and just nodes in general. Whether those nodes communicate with radio or over TCP/IP is irrelevant if they are still following the **bitcoin protocol** which is a structure of agreed procedures, input, outputs.




There is also the **ENTIRE SECTION** on the network procedures.

I live within the Western sphere of influence, but I think it is hubris if anything to say something is "impossible to control" or meaningfully influence. China has demonstrated for generations that it is capable of an immense and persistent influence over its global and local context - which are both ever expanding. Everything from the mere existence of North Korea to the tiananmen square has played out largely by the guiding hand of Chinese influence. They may not dictate events globally as much but they sure do locally.
Since the beginning of recorded history humans are often controlled. When they aren't controlled explicitly through force they are manipulated through propaganda, or cultural institutions. It's sad, but to this day it remains the norm. People sometimes become so distraught with this abuse that they revolt, sure, but that is a lot rarer under the discerning eye of an enormous and well funded manipulation machine.

Treating *anything* like a get rich scheme is delusional. Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a technology. Learn about that technology for a couple of months and decide for yourself if it's a technology you want to use. If you do decide you want to use it you have to buy some. **At no point should the expectation you will double your money in a given amount of time enter your mind**. If it does don't invest. Many of us have weathered multi-year down turns just like any economy does. The same could begin happening tomorrow for all anyone knows. The price could go to zero. Keep in mind this very real possibility.
All that said some of us know all those things and choose to use bitcoin as our bank account or keep our savings here, so just understand what you are signing up for. Take time. Regardless of what the price does there is no rush.

I don't know if every merchant is immediately converting back to fiat, making me little more than a supporter of the various bitcoin-fiat transaction systems and any accepting merchant, but I'd like to think that if any keep it I'm contributing to the economy and it costs me nothing.

We're here for the long haul. I know when I buy bitcoins, its with the intent to spend them over the course of the rest of my life. The situation you're describing where a collapse occurs due to major players in bitcoin abusing their position we see happens at least several times a year. As you can also observe, the community is composed of players of varying awareness. Mt. Gox used to be the largest exchange, and the informed community largely abandoned them months ago for the reason you're describing. The situation where for three years every month there is a Mt.Gox is incredibly unlikely, since an observable population of us are rational reactors and won't be abused by the same bad actor twice. We also limit our risk.
I see bitcoin not as digital currency, but as self banking with transaction freedom. Draconian regulation? Good luck enforcing them offshore. All exchanges finance terrorisim? Watch me start my own.
Bitcoin can be a great benefit to the state, any state. It isn't anti government the way some crazy libertarians might lament. The benefit comes from a new kind of investment. Not replacing institutional big money, but coming alongside it, composed largely of international investors invigorating tech growth in a new digital economy.

Wouldn't this same argument suggest Overstock is making a poor business decision which will cost it money, among others?
The numbers just don't support that conjecture. Overstock share price alone has rebounded - in small part due to the positive press exposure and new community relationships Overstock continues to foster. Small volume we may have, but case examples are popping up all over of large companies able to manage whatever additional support cost bitcoin may require and realize an increased profit while at it.

BTC can, does, and will in the future continue to exist alongside fiat and other mediums of exchange and value. It doesn't subvert anything. It has many use cases which make it an excellent resource to those who wish to subvert the government, but the technology itself is just a protocol and isn't made to replace anything. It's an amalgamation of various technologies which solved the long standing double spend problem coupled with various peer to peer aspects. Unless you believe any peer to peer medium is inherently subversive I don't see how you can think bitcoin is subverting anything.

Let me put on my cynics cap for a moment.
The biggest real risks to bitcoin are an apathetic community of miners and quantum computing. Without a responsive mining community able to defensively fork against real threats in the coming decade bitcoin will be paralyzed and unable to respond to changing conditions.
Now taking the cap off.
All that said the security model in bitcoin isn't cryptographic, it's economic. It's a Nash equilibrium. There is clear financial incentive for the mining community to respond to threats of the scale of quantum computing and when the time comes I expect - with some mild kicking and screaming - they will.
Other threats include bitcoins use cases diminishing to rivals, the breaking of SHA256(SHA256()) and the breaking of ECDSA (by quantum means or otherwise). Any of these threats of a significant enough presence would require unprecedented action by miners that no one can tell you for sure would happen. But as I said, there's an enormous financial incentive for miners to keep the wheel turning on this great experiment and I thus have an equally enormous faith in bitcoins economic security model.

Those are all facts, and I agree.
Do you believe it potentially cost Overstock more to train their employees in bitcoin then they will net in increased profit margin?
Assuming sales don't absolutely stop,  the initial training investment need not be repeated as new staff will be trained with bitcoin inherently. With no new investment in training required, so long as any sales at all continue they will, as a function of time, see increased revenue on bitcoin sales vs not adopting bitcoin.
There also might be an argument to be made that bitcoin users don't expect much of any hand holding when making purchases at this early stage of the game, and extensive support staff retraining isn't required. I don't know. But I do know that if Amazon could convince its customers to use bitcoin on its site while maintaining quality of service it would make more money.

More than that, pre-selecting people to evaluate highly complex and technically advanced cases who have no prior knowledge of similar systems is literally selecting for ignorance. I understand the argument for avoiding bias, but that is not what is accomplished primarily with jury selection. What is accomplished is both the defense and prosecutor attempt to gain a favorable jury by any means necessary.

To the rest of the world it's called having risk limits and stop losses and it's a very important thing to keep people from going bankrupt and killing themselves.

If they do what you suggest they are potentially screwed and whatever they needed that money for which established their risk limit is now screwed too.

In some contexts maybe, but there is NO situation in which you can be holding bitcoin and pretend you aren't gambling. Ignoring the risks inherent to owning bitcoin is a great way to lose your money. Even when you exchange all the counterparty risk to yourself, you still have that risk. There is still a non-zero probability that bitcoins value will resolve to 0. Pretending that gold and bitcoin are the same with similar risks or even less risks for bitcoin is outright incorrect.
There's no rational discussion to be had with someone who wants to believe what they want to believe. Gambling is uncontrolled risk, it's that simple.

The economic assurance of the miner/blockchain relationship is obviously the fundamental and securing novelty of the otherwise impossible secure decentralized network.  You won't hear me suggest divorcing the ideas.  I don't know why you feel the need for this rather out of context diatribe. The existence of that relationship does not mean that use of bitcoin as a financial tool need be the primary derivation of bitcoins value.
No one is declaring bitcoin isn't money, or won't always be used as currency. Save yourself some time typing and read carefully.

The reason that a larger blocksize may increase decentralization is due to an abundance of miners existing in China seperated from the majority of nodes by the great firewall. 
If the majority of nodes are currently inside china a larger blocksize will increase centralization as the chinese miner majority will further recieve a propagation advantage for their blocks while miners outside China must deal with the lag created by the great firewall as they race to propagate their found blocks.
If however the majority of nodes are outside China then the non-Chinese miner minority recieve a propagation advantage to their blocks as Chinese miners have to get their large blocks through their firewall on their subpar internet connections. In this scenario with the majority of nodes existing outside China you have decentralization pressure creating advantages for miners not currently in China, thus more non-chinese nodes and better race conditions for non-chinese miners.
So in my view the primary way increased blocksize may increase decentralization despite a larger storage burden on nodes is due to propogation advantages for non-chinese miners and node operators as the larger block size increases latency to most nodes for chinese miners. A larger blocksize may lead to a more decentralized geographic distribution of the bitcoin networks resources.

If you agree that a contentious, "hostile", propaganda and politically driven hard fork is the worst possible thing that could happen to bitcoin - as I believe - then you surely must accept that the actions of the r/bitcoin moderation team over the past several years have drastically increased the likelihood of that eventuality. That likelihood has been increased through the alienation of people who don't understand, the censorship of users running the gamut from incredibly stupid, to zealous, to just business users with no technical background.
You're right. You've saved r/bitcoin from being what could honestly be a much worse place. But in doing so you've created real cause to support the insane conspiracy theorists, you've given population to their platform by removing those discussions from here and provided them concrete examples of their otherwise imagined oppression.
Again if you want examples of the damage this has caused simply look over at rbtc. Over there blockstream == core == r/bitcoin mod staff. It's an insane propoganda machine that is only possible, is only fueled to the degree it is because r/bitcoin moderators have reacted so strongly to it.  
Another example of the damage caused by the moderators here is every blocksize debate ever, including the whaleclub one I mention earlier. Only two arguments Ver ever makes are based on 1) what he perceives as the needs of business users, and 2) the censorship and political abuse of blockstream == core == r/bitcoin - and the entire debate becomes about people trying to convince dumbasses like Roger that these three groups aren't actually the same. It dominates the narrative outside the bubble of safety you've created here.
You've saved the foot at the expense of the body, again causing much more damage by giving substance to conspiracy than would ever have been caused by allowing bots to spam conspiracy mercilessly.
Possibly the worst part of it is, as you note in every thread, the bots are still here. All you've done is create selection pressure for more effective and subtle means of information control. So yes, this place is better than it would be with no moderation - but the bitcoin ecosystem has been fractured as a result and that fracture currently poses one of the largest threats to bitcoin possible.

You and I have a disagreement about this. 
I remember when the specific CSS rule came into effect. It was done as a means of stopping the popular opinions which were very anti-moderation from being voiced, and raising the voice of theymos out of the gutter. It was coupled with the choice thread selection of sorting comments by controversial to elevate what the moderation staff feel are valuable opinions.
If there is one fact of this discussion which must be overwhelmingly clear - **your choices as moderators of this subreddit are responsible for more damage to the bitcoin ecosystem than any legion of spammers or bot accounts.**
There is an unbelievable hypocrisy in making an argument that the CSS changes are to maintain the readability of unreadable comments while you ban users for making comments you find against "Bitcoin's best interests". The moderation team of this sub have decided they are the sole arbiters of truth in what is "Bitcoin's best interests" and that is entirely what's wrong.
Do you remember the audio "debate" between Ver and a bunch of segwit supporters/core devs a while ago from the whaleclub teamspeak? Every single participant denounced this subreddits moderation practices and acknowledged the damage that's been done.  The only prominent bitcoin figures who don't acknowledge the damage being done are the r/bitcoin moderation team.
So if one of us is going to get all riled up and climb atop our morally high horse about what is and isn't a deceptive representation of events, it sure isn't going to be you. The mod team here lives in an alternate univese where people who are passionate about bitcoin and active users are brigaders; where every tool in the moderation toolbox must be deployed to maintain a moderator friendly narrative. Trying to portray your CSS rules as something that enhances readability is only true in the context that it enhances the readability of the narrative you subscribe to.
"Snap out of it man".
Edit: And I can't believe you'd suggest I'm some sort of Ver zealot after all the work I've done countering misinformation in that shit hole rbtc, read my post history. This is exactly what I'm talking about when I say you're engaging in some sort of war - everyone you see is a combatant and you've got your ban hammer ready. Knock that shit off.

It's possible I'm misunderstanding this so please correct me - but the majority of the hashing power which sits in China needs to propagate large blocks as they mine them to the rest of the nodes on the network, the majority of which exist [outside of China]( 
Doesn't the fact that Chinese miners need to propagate blocks through the firewall to reach a majority of nodes give the race condition advantage to the non-Chinese miners who don't need to pass the firewall to reach a majority of nodes?

I think it's a valuable conversation, even beyond the specifics of one use case, just because there is such a commonly held belief in the rest of the crypto space that "archival" nodes as you and the Ethereum team both call them  are not necessary, that pruned nodes do the same job with the same security properties and no trade offs. Lightning is just an example because it relies on potentially non-recent chain state, but there are potentially many uses that do and as you already noted and I want to underline, it impacts the health of the whole network.
A sophisticated user can do anything, tailoring their resource usage to their needs and fully aware of every trade off present. That is unfortunately not most users and we as such need to spread awareness of those trade offs.

The least cataclysmic of these options is to concede a hardfork to BU consensus and progress from there. It maintains the hashrate, it will likely maintain the price, and it will keep transactions flowing. More than that it puts competent and risk adverse devs right in the heart of the fire, which is where we need them most.
I understand the strong feelings many have about the centralization this will introduce, but I assure you that through this split centralization will be present on both chains as the big players take a larger chunk of their respective pies. There may be no way to avoid this short term and we need to think about ways to reduce centralization in this new potential reality. I can think of no devs better for that job than the ones who have rallied against this risky hardfork and fully understand the pile of shit we are getting ourselves into.
I'm very uneasy about the idea we should let our chain be crippled for a month, further incentivizing miners to move away from core while fees explode and blocks stagnate. Our network of miners is what creates our economic security model and I would be very hesitant to throw that away to another coin by changing PoW, though I am keen on the idea of creating some sort of PoW failsafe mechanic where we could switch PoW with relatively little pain should a quantum attack materialize in the coming decade.

Appealing to your education then saying a full node isn't important is a pretty big contradiction. Maybe you aren't as educated as you think you are.
It's not important to "max" out security and privacy, it's important for not trusting others period. If you are comfortable trusting someone for various use cases that's fine, great even - just know who you are trusting and the extent of that trust. Make educated decisions. Right now most users aren't even aware of the trust trade offs they are making.
Saying you would never need a full node unless living under a dictatorship is to entirely miss the point of running a full node. If you are comfortable trusting someone else always that's good for you but it absolutely should not be the default for everyone.

1. Yes, rational for running a business and collecting fees not maturing a decentralized protocol. That's exactly what this post is about. Exchanges are banks, they are businesses, and they are not allies of the Bitcoin protocol. They serve their investors and owners whims, nothing else.
2. There was nothing well intended about S2X or the NYA from the perspective of a protocol participant. It was businesses looking to subsidize their costs, for transaction fee stability, and for scale. Those are all well intended from strictly the perspective of the business being self serving, and disastrous to the protocol and maintainers of decentralization when the mechanisms of accomplishing those goals are the ones the business community proposed. It was further short sighted engineering, with absolutely no business resources spent on the Bitcoin protocol they sought to dictate, just on themselves. It wasn't well intentioned, it was strictly self serving. If it was well intentioned why not commit developer resources and several years time as asked? Why not collaborate with the community and protocol participants, developers and node runners and users, in any way? Not at all well intentioned. It was a take over attempt.
 
The UASF was absolutely malicious, it was a dangerous act of war responding to an act of war. I wasn't in favor of it at the time, and I still believe UASF dangerous, but it very clearly demonstrated the active role node runners play in consensus and security as well as forced the segwit softfork issue. It also demonstrated Core doesn't dictate consensus at all, as it was opposed by most maintainers and those nodes who did run UASF did so of their own volition as an insurgent movement led by lukejr.
There is nothing 'wtf' about calling a limited and exclusive party of business owners trying to direct development of an open source, volunteer driven protocol whose inherent function is decentralized consensus an attack. There is something 'wtf' about being so eager to deny the facts though.

Bitcoin is a protocol. You can run the protocol by installing node software on your computer. The bitcoin token is just a tool to enable the protocol. The protocol accomplishes trustless verification and decentralized consensus. If you aren't running a node you aren't engaging in the protocol, you're trusting someone. It's very important to understand who if anyone you are trusting when using Bitcoin so you understand your risks.
Running a node costs resources in harddrive space, bandwidth, and processing time. Running one allows you to trust no one and gives you a role in the security of the network. You can learn about how to run a node here:

I always talk technology. Bitcoin is valuable because it creates a unique trust model and platform for accomplishing tasks leveraging that trust.

Is there even a mechanism in any full node to accomplish the height/date based pruning you describe? As far as I know it's size based pruning on all full nodes. All of these caveats are what make it unsafe. You would have to be constantly resetting your pruning size to keep that March 28 2018 block.
Can pruned nodes do some jobs? Sure. They aren't as safe as full nodes for many jobs though, meaning they do not have identical security properties.

That's because hardware wallets are doing exactly the process I describe of signing the keys in a secure inaccessible environment before broadcasting signed transactions to the infected node (assuming you use your own node, you should!), the keys never touch the infected machine.

Creating economic incentive for full nodes would get more node runners. That's undisputed. What is disputed is that it's the only or even the best way to solve the problem. Any incentive is a modifier on the number of nodes that would otherwise exist, and the specific incentive of an economic incentive implies someone paying that incentive and an entirely new distribution mechanism. Both of those are nontrivial issues with trade offs and consequences depending on your proposed solution. I also expect there would be issues creating a significant incentive. It's one thing to pay a single miner a transaction fee plus coinbase, it's another to pay hundreds of thousands of potential node runners in a way meaningful enough to incentivize them. The most obvious answer is another coinbase, but that's the kind of inflation that would be entirely rejected at the consensus level.
It sounds like a good idea, but as soon as you dive into the details it gets very messy.

The lightning network literally is Bitcoin, it's sophisticated Bitcoin transactions that enable offchain interactions. If you are using it on Bitcoin alone you are using Bitcoin.
When a user correctly thinks that Bitcoin is lightning, they aren't unable to pay their partner or at risk of losing their coins by sending to an altcoins address. I question the calibration of your moral compass. The potential harms from misunderstanding are entirely incomparable even if you do incorrectly believe lightning is not Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-03-12 18:34:27
First things first, you can check your transactions success by using what is called a [block explorer]( which is viewing the live bitcoin network (while you are still "updating"). Just paste your receive address into the search box. If your transaction is reported by a block explorer as confirmed, then they are confirmed and waiting for you when your Bitcoin Core finishes downloading the entire blockchain.
Bitcoin Core is the heavy lifting hardware that does all the work of the bitcoin network. While you are running Bitcoin Core you essentially are a part of the backbone that is bitcoin, and it is the way any businesses or trustless entities should use bitcoin as it gives them full trustless access to the bitcoin network. Another kind of wallet is called an SPV wallet, where you are essentially using someone else's version of Bitcoin Core so you don't need a copy of the whole blockchain . That "updating" delay you are experiencing is the blockchain downloading, and is unnecessary on SPV clients because SPV clients hook up to someone else who has downloaded the entire blockchain, and you're implicitly choosing to trust them to a small degree by using an SPV wallet.
Examples of SPV wallets are mobile phone wallets like mycelium and electrum.
If you checked a block explorer and your funds are confirmed and you decide you want to switch to an SPV wallet to get your funds immediately, you may get your receive address private key using instructions found [here]( and google "import private key X" where X is the SPV client you end up choosing.

Legal systems define ownership, but the Bitcoin protocol defines ownership that supersedes legal ownership. Many coins are stolen, but bitcoin doesn't distinguish their ownership the way a stolen car would be difficult to transact. Bitcoin is fungible. As far as Bitcoin is concerned whoever can sign a transaction spending the coins validly is the owner.
You can appeal to the legal system of your choice to appeal to their definition of ownership, but they cannot supersede the protocols requirement for keys to equate ownership. They can only try to find the keys.

Again I agree it's an uphill battle, but if you're willing to give up on getting users to run full nodes you may as well be ready to give up on Bitcoin. Full nodes are that fundamentally important. You can only even run, what, 20 SPV wallets off a full node and realistically the numbers are lower than that because many nodes aren't listening and limit connections. We face existential threats from actors just as we did with BCH requiring full nodes to be present and vigilant. We also need full nodes just to trust no one. They are incredibly important.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:17:45
Yes, I agree with all of that - but Core already allows users to run near instantly after minor setup in a graduating to full node manner and as far as I know SPV support still hasn't been merged in.  What's the goal of adding a Neutrino server to Core and why does it need an upgrade to something it doesn't currently support? I'm a little more up in the air about whether neutrino p2p endpoints need to be in Core to enable these light clients. I think a couple people maybe including Luke dislike neutrino inherently, but I have no problem with trust trade offs existing so long as people understand what they are trading off. Again, education is so so important IMO to the long term success of this protocol. I see this got a concept ack so I expect as always it will be about educating people on their options.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:51:11
Are you suggesting Core node runners will choose to abandon core if it doesn't natively support neutrino clients? The vast majority of neutrino users I don't expect will be themselves neutrino server runners or Core runners, though I can dream.
The real advantaged users here will be the many mobile users running neutrino clients, not the server runners. I don't think the cost of a few additional rpc calls, bandwidth, and some additional database use is disastrous but it's not nothing. As someone whose goal is to reduce disincentives such as node costs and even replace them with incentives like monetary reward, I would think you would also be in favor of minimalism in the reference implementation by default.

Isn't it an option to have this functionality in other software though? It's rather a moot point since it's already happening, but my default position would be to see neutrino servers be stacked on top of core not included in it. Maybe it will get a compile time option, that might be sufficient.

It is a subsidization of costs. You are pushing fees from coinbase onto node runners resource usage requirements.
Economic decentralization is irrelevant. One person could own 99% of all bitcoins and it wouldn't be a centralized protocol. Transactions could cost as much as you can dream of and it wouldn't imply anything about protocol decentralization. Bitcoin is a protocol and it is where decentralization matters. bitcoin with a lower case is a token, and it has no properties of decentralization nor needs any.
There was absolute a right side and a wrong side. What luke does when he campaigns for lower block sizes, that's a difference of values. He doesn't gain anything either way, he is stating an opinion as an engineer. He isn't attacking consensus or threatening the protocol. What the NYA participants did was self serving and literally an attack on consensus.  Luke isn't committing anyone to a consensus or organizing influential parties. What luke is doing is 'signalling' as you say. The NYA was not signalling, it was a consensus of business owners and commitment to execution.
if you expect bitcoin fees to be low forever or stable you are going to be disappointed. Fees protect Bitcoin from several kinds of attacks. For years now, over half a decade, the entire community has discussed scaling solutions and they settled very appropriately on scaling in layers much as most network protocols scale features and functionalities.  If you want low stable fees, use lightning. Bitcoin will never have them for any extended duration of time in the future despite many blockspace optimizing improvements.
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:56:31
because as I said, it's important people understand the trust trade offs and we do need to be wary of creating a more trusting network and reducing node counts as we scale. There is a way to do both, and it includes keeping neutrino out of Core and instead on battery powered devices where it is well suited. Maybe even letting other full node implementations handle the neutrino servers.

The fees to close the channel, literally called commit fees, are committed at the time of channel creation and updated over the course of the channels life as on-chain fees change.
You can't close a channel by DDoSing the participants. You can make it inactive, but not force it to settle. Channels regularly are inactive and they are routed around.
If for some reason you chose to force close as many actively used channels from as many nodes as possible at once (which we have seen a handful of times already as people experiment with the network) transactions would be routed around alternative routes where available. Force closed channels also have a clearing time, some of my channels don't clear for over 100 hours worth of blocks. Gracefully closed channels resolve almost immediately.

You don't need an economic incentive there are non economic incentives and you don't need neutrino.  Pruned nodes work perfectly fine and can mature into full nodes. Neutrino is a dramatically different trust model than a pruned/full node and while useful for some use cases such as mobile, don't really have a place in Core.
Full/pruned node = trusting yourself
SPV client = trusting someone else's full node
Neutrino  = trusting the miner who made the last commitment edit: or not? did the I miss the meaning of the talk at the [unconfiscatable conference](
We should not encourage or incentivize the last option beyond users who wouldn't use full nodes in the first place, like on mobile.

As already described, there is an enormous difference between signalling or discussing an idea and the NYA agreement. It's literally an agreement by name to execute an action. The discussion that happened outside that closed room largely rejected its artificial consensus and took action to protect themselves.
Bitcoins value comes from decentralization and its unique security model. While the bitcoin token's application and potential use cases may create value for the token that may be enhanced by the scale of users much per metcalfe's law, the underlying decentralization is what enables that value at all. Without one, any discussion of the other is entirely pointless. Bitcoin is thus not a typical network where users strictly define value, though the token may be. You cannot have  bitcoin token without a decentralized Bitcoin protocol, so sacrificing decentralization for gains in token users is an inherently losing strategy.
If I had a genie I would take 10x more full nodes on the network. There is a strong argument to be made that if you aren't engaging in the protocol you are not a Bitcoin user. Coinbase users are not Bitcoin users. They are Coinbasecoin users. They engage in the protocol not at all, and while using coinbase don't even control their own keys. Even if you disagree that you must be engaging the protocol to be  Bitcoin user, you surely must agree that there are practical limits to the number of SPV wallets the existing public, listening node count can facilitate. The default is 20 per node. We need nodes no matter what your view on whether users should have to run one.

That's exactly how the attack works, and yes they paid those fees and the fees are the only reason they eventually stopped. It cost them an arm and a leg. It's not conspiracy, it's simple observation. The community was fighting, and transactions literally structured to send less than they spent in fees filled the bottom of the mempool and layered upwards for months. It was an attack, plain and simple. These transaction had no op return data of any known significance, they weren't colored coins, they were single satoshi transactions with multi-dollar fees. There is no use for them but to fill mempool and blocks.

I wasn't implying you were saying full nodes aren't necessary as you have repeatedly now said otherwise, I was explaining why these discussions are culturally valuable in this space IMO.
We do agree on everything, we've agreed since your first comment. My sole motivation in this conversation has been clarifying for readers that pruned nodes and full nodes are not the same. That even as you describe they can provide the same individual level of assurances, that doesn't mean they inherently will. It requires applied knowledge to protect yourself on the individual level when running a pruned node. You have to understand your use cases and their necessary use of the blockchain, and in some instances like lightning would have to create a script that constantly changes your prune size - or as you suggest have a buffer large enough to mandate manual prune size adjustments a couple times a year.
None of those are things you don't know. I'm not here educating someone who clearly knows what they are talking about. I'm instead trying to offer a fuller picture of the realities of pruned and full nodes beyond "they have the same security properties", because IMO the discussion is necessarily more nuanced than that.

It certainly is very neat, a great example of innovation within constraints. For me the current code and discussion are more valuable in presenting the idea of routing arbitrary data over the p2p network to enable further functions. It could be a neat thing, especially for those without internet connectivity. The lightning blockstream satellites are pretty cool for similar reasons - global lightning funded messaging and bitcoin network access.
Maybe if enough people get excited about the idea someone will build it, people will choose to run it, and then more people will build end user solutions on top of that. It takes years to get things like AMP and any changes to bolt. I'm not expecting a payment unrelated use case to  jump to the front of consensus discussions.

Bitcoin persists on an economic security model. It's only as secure as it is expensive to attack. Do you have any idea how insane it would be to degrade the entire value of that security model by reducing the cost to attack our network to a gpu farm? The only scenario in which migrating away from our current miners is acceptable is as a last resort in the midst of a successful attack - cutting off the limb to save the body scenario.
Viewing the miners as an enemy to be avoided displays a gross misunderstanding of how bitcoin functions.

You are relying on the security and properties of whatever coin you are using. As I explicitly said, if you are using Bitcoin alone on lightning then you are using Bitcoin's security, your literal Bitcoin tokens. It is literally an extension of function of Bitcoin, not an entirely incomparable and unrelated network like BCH. Again, comparing the two and their totally disparate potential harms to people who misunderstand (An incompatible network, entirely different asset, and severe risk of loss for trying to use BCH on BTC) versus the nonexistent risk of misunderstanding that Bitcoin is or isn't lightning makes me question your moral compass. How you can view those as equally wrong even if your incorrect assumptions about what lightning is were true is incoherent.

The proliferation and creation of educational materials for Bitcoin already is some of the best in any open source community. Bitcoin is an excellent example of an open source project with unpaid educators and evangelicals.
You're right that it's incredibly difficult to educate and we aren't doing a good enough job even if we are doing such a good job that we compete with multimillion dollar advertising competitors. We need to be doing better than even the best.
I don't agree we are "doubly doomed" but I completely agree it could be our doom which is why I'm talking about it. Full nodes play an important security role. We need educated, technically and politically aware node runners and it will always be an uphill battle to make new ones. We saw how important node runners were during the BCH fork for both the network and individual users. 


You understand incorrectly. Polling nodes to come to consensus is exactly the kind of model susceptible to Sybil attacks PoW and full chain verification was used to avoid. It's a perfectly reasonable stop gap for many uses cases as I continue to note, but the trust model of SPV wallets are far from equivalent to full nodes.
I can't stress enough that it's not anyones fault that people don't understand this. Not only disseminating this information but getting the base technical literacy among the general population to make informed decisions using this information may be an impossible task. I have hope that since the once thought impossibly complex mechanisms of the internet are now broadly understood by internet using populations we might find educational success too. Even though our task may be more difficult we can achieve similar results in the coming decades. If that doesn't happen we may see the security for the average non-full node Bitcoin user degrade as we approach scale.

The whole point is that only people with enough money get to buy expensive mining rigs and have a say. You can buy a small one and have a tiny say, just like you could buy a small amount of bitcoin and have a negligible say in some silly PoS voting system. Why wouldn't you prefer the security model which raises the economic barrier to attack to it's highest possible, while maintaining a nash equilibrium of economic incentives to maintain and amplify that economic security model?
The barriers to attack a PoS model are quite simply smaller and not dynamic as a function of time. If someone chooses to buy 50% of all of a PoS currency in existence (studies suggest much less of the network would have to be bought to effectively attack a PoS coin), they have control forever until they choose to sell. If someone wants to buy 50% of all miners in existence on a PoW blockchain, they will have to continue their economic attack as a function of time - as more miners compete with them. You can't buy coins that aren't being sold to counter an attack on a PoS coin, but you can produce more hashing hardware to counter an attack on a PoW coin. You can rebel against the miners in a PoW coin as well as a node runner. You don't have the same breadth of defensive options as a PoS coin without destroying fungibility.
The idea that you want to keep PoW but move consensus voting to another system is just... why even have PoW if you aren't going to use it as a "proof" in your consensus layer? It just doesn't make sense.

I'm not ignoring that fact, I am repeatedly saying that those people shouldn't be in Bitcoin. You are ignoring me.


I'm not ignoring that either, I'm again repeatedly saying those people should continue to use banks and not use Bitcoin until superior security models are adopted by their banks to handle low trust assets. You ignoring my response isn't me ignoring you.


I again have repeatedly used liquid as such an example, but any federated custody model such as multisignature, or as coinbase vault used to be setup by default to enable shared custody with the user. I again repeat, maybe you should read what you are responding to before insisting I am ignoring your points.


Some assets and paradigms still inherently lend themselves to trusting others. Bitcoin isn't one of them. As I repeat again, when you take a low trust asset meant to supplant existing models of trust and instead throw it into existing trust models it is harmful to users and beneficial to agents of trust. There can be no argument that an index fund is an inherently superior security model being shoehorned into an inferior security model so why even bring it up? It has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

I like a lot of the work the NIST does but their cryptocurrency related work is quite a mixed bag. I like that they talk about the "nothing at stake" problem with PoS. I wish they would talk at all about the inherent inefficiency of blockchains and the superior traditional solutions that exist for many permissioned blockchains. They touch very briefly on the fact that blockchains aren't inherently immutable but do little to describe where the properties of immutability come from or the nash equilibrium that keeps all security actors, not just miners, working together. They don't discuss near enough the economic security model and its consequences.
My ideal NIST document would strongly discourage the use of permissioned blockchains that do not themselves resolve to an adequately secured permissionless blockchain, and delve deeper into the decentralized security models security actors including network participants and the incentives which drive them. Some talk of layered blockchain solutions like drivechains and sidechains and most importantly off chain solutions would go a long way too.

There are incentives to run a node, they just aren't monetary. The incentive to run a node is largely selfish, you do it to provide yourself a service just as you might run tor or torrents or a vpn or any other software to provide yourself a service. The economic incentives exist as part of the security mechanisms of the network and don't exist to incentivize honest actions from nodes.  Bitcoin users aren't affected by hostile nodes **if and only if you are running your own node**. Miners need to be bribed to create the costs to attack the block organization and consequently Bitcoins immutability. Nodes don't have that kind of power, they can't harm anyone but themselves.

The OP is about whether or not Neutrino should be in Core, though we've been having our own discussion about the viability and necessity of economic node incentives.  I think everyone is happy or at least indifferent about these solutions existing at all. The question is about how they should be promoted and applied. IMO on both issues, economic incentives would be nice but aren't really doable and a neutrino server doesn't belong in Core.

Just like regular money, when you send it electronically isn't necessarily when it settles at its destination. You sent bitcoin but it hasn't settled yet. The speed at which it settles is determined by the fee you pay and the fee the people competing with you for fast settlement pay.
Each ~10 minutes 1-1.2 MB gets settled. You're 11.65 MB behind the first in the queue. People can jump in front of you in the queue by paying more than you. You can jump in front of the queue by using RBF to pay more fees as well.

I'm one of those that believes etf's are a tool to shoehorn the reinvention of trust into old trust models. The questions you have about how an etf functions are those very questions of how does the old trust model function. The answer is it functions using law, regulatory observation, and penal action. Bitcoin doesn't require those intermediaries to create trust and making a financial vehicle that removes the Bitcoin trust model for the old world trust model is imo inherently backwards thinking.
We already have paper bitcoin and custodial bitcoin and both pose problems. The last thing we need is custodial paper bitcoin safeguarded by the SEC. The people that want an etf are imo only concerned about the price. If you want a vehicle to trade futures those already exist, but institutional money won't use those vehicles because they are outside US jurisdiction. I say screw institutional US money, they have no interest in bitcoin they have interest in transforming it to fit their world view. The NY Bitlicense, bullying services to conform to old world financial regulation, shutting down of international exchanges and services outside the US jurisdiction, and mass of US companies that have attempted consensus changes is all evidence of their war against bitcoin. The US is the enemy of Bitcoin and an etf would be just another means for them to extend their regulatory grasp into our space.

Coinbase and the way they do business represents the antithesis to  what the decentralized crypto ecosystem should function as far as many are concerned. Profitable business? Yes. But the more significant their influence in the ecosystem the more people like myself aren't going to like it.
You shouldn't "feel safe" letting anyone hold your crypto, and the fact that so many people want exactly that is cringe worthy. The only reason those people are invested in bitcoin is they think it will make them rich. I personally hold them in esteem just above investors in ponzi schemes.

I'm sure we would see more nodes with more incentives to run one, but we would also see even higher onchain fees. Do we "need" those economic incentives? I say no.

You can see it even in this thread. People genuinely believe that some minority of coin holders withdrawing from some exchanges equates to exchanges being full reserve. For some this event (which they see is labeled "mandatory") is how they are being taught to trust no one - as opposed to the actual steps necessary to reduce trust in this environment. They pop their coins out Jan 3rd and back in Jan 4th.
Another issue with hijacking this pirate ship and turning it around is part of the appeal of this campaign is it tells users holding on exchanges there is nothing wrong with what they are doing, just make this minor adjustment one day a year and you get to keep doing what is convenient and easy while pretending you're part of this revolution in trust. The reality is trusting yourself is neither convenient or easy, especially if you want your coins to be liquid. The awareness campaign I think this event should be is a much tougher sell than "proof of keys" is.

I regret that I only have one downvote to give. Learning economics in "easy to understand terms" should strongly imply to you that you aren't learning economics. I think even foundational Austrian economists like Hayek and Mises who believe free markets are the best mechanism of resource allocation would strong disagree that "socialism is death", they believe it was a road to serfdom if anything not death. I wonder if they would cringe at the way their views have been twisted by a modern culture that can't even bother to read their publications.
In a lot of ways Bitcoin and cryptocurrency address some of Hayek's concerns about socialism, such as that it is only possibly maintained by a central authority of some kind. We now live in a world where social and financial rules can be codified and run on free market financial incentives, which eliminate the previously necessary central authority Hayek describes.
More and more Bitcoin is becoming a platform for those with extreme ideas and very little rationality. Socialism is pervasive and the modern international norm. Can you even imagine a true laissez faire economy with no regulations or permitting or anything at all? 12 year olds working dangerous jobs with no safety equipment and no unions to protect them, getting paid in company script spendable at the company store.
If someone thinks socialism is death they clearly live in a very small cultural bubble driven by propaganda which defines the majority of the worlds population as zombies.

What at all is unreasonable about spending the time necessary to understand an entirely new and revolutionary model of trust before dumping money into it. Do you hear what you are saying? That people should be investing in things they don't understand?
Bitcoin is being your own bank. That doesn't mean keeping your savings at home or in your memory, banks don't keep their customers savings on hand and accessible. Some minor amount, sure, but tiered accessibility and access control procedures are the staple of any bank and if you are securing a significant amount they should be yours too.
I do absolutely understand why being your own bank isn't for everyone, and those people should at this exact moment not be in Bitcoin. They should wait until sole custody services are replaced by things like group custody services or shared custody services. This is what for example liquid does. In this way the user need not be their own bank but still engages in a security model superior to sole custody and lending itself to the security attributes of the underlying asset. It isn't trustless but it is less trusting.
That's what this revolution in trust is about, replacing old trust models with new superior ones. Instead to replace new superior trust models with old inferior ones for the benefit of engaging customers who don't know what they are investing in seems egregiously dishonest and self serving on the part of service providers.

I researched for 9 months before I started. I highly suggest everyone I know who is interested do the same. Even as a technical professional understanding what Bitcoin is and the entire crypto space is becomes very complicated.
Bitcoin is not an investment. It is not a currency. It is a protocol, like the internet. Bitcoin is the solution to a problem in multi-party consensus. How do you agree in a distributed system what database state is correct and everyone should use? What happens when some people disagree about the state?
Traditionally these problems have been solved by authorities and solutions like voting, but both solutions inherently cause problems. Voting can be rigged, and authorities can be corrupt. Bitcoin proposes a new solution - bribery for honest behavior.
You can use money to incentivize people to agree on a database state while competing with each other. You can make attacking the network through dishonest behavior simply less profitable than being honest. This is why Bitcoin has a currency at all. Not because it is a speculative investment vehicle, but because we need to incentivize the network actors to be honest to accomplish the protocols goal - multi-party independent agreement and immutable state. This is essentially a new kind of trust. You can trust up to the amount it would cost to attack the protocol that the database state is final.
This means a lot of things for Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies attempting to copy it. It means that the security of the networks aren't absolute - they are a function of money and the number of participants involved. A "blockchain" doesn't give these properties of financial security, instead they come from the cost to attack and the number of people independently running the protocol.
None of these properties seem to drive price, as this is not a popular understanding of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. By this understanding all altcoins should be worth very little and the ones that have value should resolve to the Bitcoin blockchain, as it is the one with a significant cost to attack and distributed network participants. That's because price isn't driven by fundamentals and the vast majority of people don't understand how a blockchain is secured. Thus price swings wildly with public perception and fervor.
If you are looking to get rich short term, this is all gambling. You might as well play roulette. If you want to be part of a revolution in the way we view trust, don't bet on Bitcoin but use it. Use it to secure some of your wealth for starters and learn what it is like to trust no one but yourself. Bitcoin is a revolution of trust.

It's a custodial service. They inherently don't get it. Users of this service will not be using Bitcoin at any level - a protocol level or a token level. They will be using fidelity coin, a financial product for gambling on an underlying asset.
Bitcoin and blockchains which resolve to its security apparatus will indeed be a revolution in the financial sector. That revolution won't be custodial, it will be removing the need to trust custodianship. Even federated security models with large group ownership are a tiny step in the right direction compared to full custodial traditional financial services. Trusting banks wholesale is the past.

It's the same with rbtc. They've seen censorship they don't understand or agree with and now they see it everywhere they look.

Informational BIPs like 310 are pretty inconsequential  - basically specifying a best practise to accomplish a task to enable interoperability between services, wallets, etc.
To be incompatible means users of your service can't use other services. If you roll your own deterministic wallet solution it won't be compatible with BIP32 and the rest of the wallets in the community for example. In this case miners using Bitmains self defined method of extending stratum and handling version rolling instead of BIP310 which specifies a proposal for that extension cannot use any services other than Bitmains.
As far as I know there have been no proposed revisions to BIP310, no criticism from Bitmain. I suspect their code simply predates the BIP and they only released it now to address the new threat of Braiins OS, but that's purely speculation. Could be it is also intentional to force miners to their pools. Who could say.

The majority of us have been deep in the red at one time or another. Those of us who stuck it out and didn't invest more than we could afford to lose are ready to ride out the cycle again. We've seen several drops of over 75% from the previous ATH before. That's pretty close to where we are now, ~$5000. Sometimes the drops go as low as 90%. When you bought into bitcoin this is the roller coaster you signed up for.
This is why I don't like to daytrade anymore, it's too unpredictable out there to be gambling on what the price will be tomorrow or even next year. It's a much better gamble to be betting whether bitcoin will be worth something or nothing 5 years from now, 10. That's a gamble with a much better risk profile than the short term gambling IMO. Research and being informed can actually influence your risk over those scales, so can individual work and effort. The impact some key members of this community have had in bringing Bitcoin to its current state can't be understated, and anyone can involve themselves.

To describe this mechanism as the reason for any movement seems further madness. Surely there are people running from the stock market and into safe haven assets like Bitcoin in some measure, to have your theory dwarfing all other factors impacting price is totally unreasonable.
No, what is clearly happening is people are escaping bitfinex due to the obvious uncertainty of their banking relationship, causing a price premium.

I'm personally increasingly of the opinion that those who believe bitcoin is democratic or wish it to be are gravely mistaken. I think catering to users and businesses is a great business strategy and I get why businesses and users want that and feel like they need a powerful voice to make it a reality. As both a business owner trying to work something around bitcoin and a casual user myself I totally understand that impulse, but that's not how you engineer a product. I don't want businessmen and casual users navigating technical limitations or disregarding solutions to real problems because they were personally slighted (Roger Ver, Chinese Miners), I want evidence based and technically informed thought to guide bitcoin, and the misinformed population is the primary force keeping that from being a reality.
After over a year of education campaigning we still have 54% that are misinformed. You'll have to forgive those of us whose patience has thinned over those years; who are done educating and prepared to start shaming.

And yet an enormous population of technical illiterates still buy and use it. Comparing liquid to ripple is to say "this does the same thing but better in every way". You don't think that's a fair way to describe liquid to the people gobbling up centralized scamcoins doing the same job as liquid?

No, it is divisible to 8 decimal places and even further on other layers like lightning which adopt millisatoshi. There is never an issue of not enough of it - the banks just don't like the idea of inflating the value when they aren't the principle holders of it.

It's absolutely very different from ripple, but ripples goal as far as I understand it is to increase liquidity and reduce settlement times between financial institutions. That seems very similar to liquids foremost use case.
The description of a federated ripple on top of bitcoin seems to me to be as broadly fair as any 5 word description can be. It's secured by a federation as opposed to a centralization and runs on pegged units of bitcoin.
Other than that it's a broader platform than ripple as it enables the issuance of assets and as you note has an immutable block structure and consensus rule set. It also includes confidential transactions via zero knowledge proofs.
It's not a perfect comparison but what 5 word description is? "Federated ripple on top of bitcoin" seems to be what it does, give or take some caveats.

Courts are not police work, police work is the decision and action to seize the money. Lazy police work is to not do their job properly and leave it to the courts at great expense to all involved - effectively creating more victims by victimizing the ATM owner as well as the additional costs on the original victim.

It is a false sense of security for people who choose to hold on exchanges and undermines efforts to get people off exchanges every day of the year.

I'm calling you a lair and a dishonest debater, that's what you call playing coy?
A custodian uses bitcoin by running a node and interacting with tokens and wallets. People who use a custodian are using custodians, not bitcoin. I'm not sure why you are unable to make the distinction that people using custodians are not using bitcoin, they are using a custodian who is using bitcoin. They don't run nodes, they don't have wallets, they don't use bitcoin in any way shape or form. They delegate that responsibility to intermediaries.
I'm not playing any kind of troll or showing undue concern, I am illustrating the strategy of financial agents of trust to keep that trust - acting as custodians.

The fact that you believe decentralization even existed in computer science terms previous to PoW, let alone in your mind the only thing keeping it from existing in the IP protocol is 2nd layer solutions, is really my case in point. You don't have a clear idea at all what decentralization is despite having read the literal definition. That definition by the way isn't talking about what we're talking about when we say a decentralized protocol in the context of bitcoin, the definition you are citing is ambiguous and widely applied.

There is a lot here and it is deserving of a response, as reluctant as I am to address some of the fundamental misconceptions you have built this tower of assumptions on.
The first of those assumptions is that taxes and thus government have no role in society. This seems a little insane to me to have to justify further than the many illustrations I have made of responsible government intervention expanding freedom.
You seem to take exception with those examples like education and healthcare and protection from abusive peers as having alternative solutions in private remediation. I agree, there are alternative solutions and you list a few like private litigation - but they are horrible solutions that do not preserve freedom at all.
For one, who pays for private litigation without taxes? Who pays judges and court reporters a salary? Are there "public" prosecutors? Who makes laws and pays for their enforcement?
Even in your ideal world where we ignore the substance of that failing - civil suits cost money. Often - even in our more socialist and tax paying societies - civil suits enable individuals and groups with wealth to avoid any kind of consequence as those they are infringing on the liberty of have no resources with which to maintain a civil claim. For these reasons the idea that all disputes should be civil with no taxes is inherently a more coercive system than a system of government intervention. Big money gets to pressure those without into their will. That's not freedom, that's just another kind of serfdom. Even if you could hold a company accountable for the health consequences of say toxic waste dumping via civil suit, they just close the company as unprofitable and move on. There is no public protection or consequence stopping bad actors from continuing under any scenario that plays out because there is no entity holding them accountable. You know what does hold them accountable? The same regulations you deride.
More than that, ignoring ALL of those crippling issues, who enforces the civil suits? How is that not theft by your same definition covering taxes if the police come and evict you from your house to pay a settlement?  Who is paying the police to do that job in the first place?
The argument that taxes and government aren't necessary is absurd on its face, requiring a very superficial examination of economics and consequence.

If these services were served in client side JS over the browser they would not only introduce trust issues, but it would use much more of your bandwidth as it checks your caches at the very least if not redownloading assets with page loads.
Consumers aren't wrong for wanting convenience, speed, efficiency of resource usage. It's just unfortunate that the properties of decentralization are often at direct odds with these consumer desires. When push comes to shove, err has to be on the side of decentralization not convenience.
This philosophy has created a pretty significant schism in the BTC community. There are some who don't believe a choice needs to be made between consumer friendly and decentralization at all, or that some risks to decentralization are worth benefits to business and consumers.

Hey hey! Now we are talking! Maybe by some definitions socialism is the death of the individual if you believe the individual is uncompromising personal freedom. I could argue capitalism often ends with the death of individuality as well - if you are poor and an unprotected class.

Like I said, I'd be happy if this one day event changed its message and function away from the misguided "proof of keys" which is IMO not only pointless but harmful (by bestowing false confidence to exchange holders 364 days a year and thinking they have "proven" their exchange isn't a fractional reserve) and instead towards something constructive.
An example could be a campaign to get exchanges to prove their bitcoin holdings via proof of [reserves tools]( Another would be a single day push to get awareness out about counter party risk and how to secure your own coins. I think people like to pretend this proof of keys campaign is the latter, but it isn't even close.
I campaigned against it last year, I'll campaign against it this year. Proof of keys is a mistake and IMO no one should participate in or promote it. Lets instead promote people getting their coins off exchanges for good and teaching traders how to use the tools available to them to reduce counter party risk.

"This service is so in-demand that they are a joke"
That's essentially what you are saying. I feel like you haven't been around long, this is a fundamental problem on every exchange during periods of high volume. A couple years ago it was the case that when major movements would occur most exchanges would be suffering DDoS and more requests than they could handle. It's the nature of settlement systems, centralized and decentralized. When demand exceeds available resources users cry. This is part of the inherent risk of using any of these platforms with an orderbook. Somewhere a computer has to manage that orderbook and it can only facilitate a finite amount of orders per second.

You would have to show me some data to convince me of that. It seems to me periods of horizontal action followed by sharp swings have happened very frequently, over the span of single orders even.

A more properly structured chat protocol on lightning would include payment for the use of the decentralized network infrastructure relaying the messages and a dedicated messaging mechanism. How it currently exists is as hijacked invalid transactions spammed to nodes trying (and failing) to route payments. It consumes node resources for free and by mechanism of spamming invalid payments.

This is false and based entirely on your own feelings and assumptions. Look at the volume of btc, as a percent of the total ecosystem that has been lost to exchange failures or theft. You are arguing personal loss eclipses that. You're obviously wrong.
Moving assets is easy. 1st transaction moves btc to a new secure wallet. 2nd transaction sends bcc to exchange. Couldn't be fucking simpler.

You can mix your coins, which isn't untraceable no matter how much coinjoin insists it is, or you can transfer to a cryptocurrency that uses ring signatures for true anonymity. Moving to a ring signature based crypto is the only way to be actually untraceable, everything transferred in bitcoin is done in the clear.

One of those errors in conflating the moderation of this subreddit with the bitcoin core developers. Another is confusing Blockstream developers and core developers to be synonyms.  But they really do love bitcoin. You don't spend that much energy fighting for something you don't love. Even buttcoiners love something to do what they do as much as they do. It's probably a smug sense of superiority and drama they love, but it is love.
These are users with concerns grounded in good business sense and traditional consumer facing logic.

Dissent is what Luke does when he campaigns for smaller blocks. No one reasonably thinks he is going to die on that hill and try to take the entire protocol with him, he's talking not acting and when he does act it's by providing a fully compatible alternative node software.
The NYA/BCH/S2X business was an attack because it consisted of hostile action. The business community purposefully exclude all engineering and protocol participants in consensus in favor of business community consensus, desiring to replace the existing consensus with their own. It's further an attack when they don't get their way so they try to fork off and literally take the brand of Bitcoin with them, buying every social media account and domain related to bitcoin, and then use all those resources to direct people to their 2.5% hashpower 1k nodes "real Bitcoin" when users think they are buying BTC. More than that, they also spammed the blockchain in a pattern that continued for over a year leading up to the manufactured blocksize and fee event with the goal of creating a pretense to support their position of subsidizing business activity with larger blocks.

Too many like to appeal to the whitepaper like some sort of bible or constitution. It's a specification for a technology that doesn't even exist as described anymore. It's a useful document with important historical significance, but so are many RFCs. They aren't for idolization.

Socialism isn't based on theft, unless you view all tax as theft. Find me the version of capitalism without taxes.
Socialism is based on the measured intervention by governments to (hopefully) the benefit of their citizenry. When it isn't to the benefit of the citizenry is where we see tyranny start to show up.
I have MORE freedom from socialism than I would straight capitalism because I am protected from the actions against me by my neighbour and my employer. I as a part of the broader whole have rights that I otherwise wouldn't. The right to freedom from second hand smoke, the right to a clean living space free of industrial waste, the right to clean drinking water and no noise pollution while I sleep. I didn't have to clean my water or go to war with my neighbouring businesses to make them respect my space, government laws and intervention force them to respect my space enabling my freedom.
I have more government support to start businesses and attempt to grow myself in the local and international capitalist economy, my government pays for me to go to conferences and educate myself. Freedom to education, to healthcare, I have so many more opportunities under socialism than I ever would under anarchocapitalism to actually "pull myself up by my bootstraps", especially without fear of crippling debt and ruining my life and starving my family if I get sick.

You seem pretty upset and act as though these commentaries aren't fair. What is unfair about holding a company to their public statements and noting that excuses and technicalities are just those - excuses and technicalities? No one makes a public statement about internal milestones, which is what an implementation completed yesterday and untested clearly is.
If you would rather play a game of semantics about what is and isn't implemented that's fine, but your users (of which I have been one) only care about the expectations your company set. Don't get pissy with the community for holding you to your own words.

He was a leading proponent of Austrian economics, that's entirely why I used him as an example so of course he argued against socialism. Even he would have to acknowledge that a socialist policy isn't inherent death because he wasn't a closed mind dogmatic person. He held strong beliefs but acknowledged the world around him and frequently used the geopolotic examples of his day to bolster his position. It was also at a time where many socialist policies were abject failures and precursors to tyranny - much as some are today.
You don't think he could look at modern definitions of socialism in practise and thought and see from the inherent examples that they were not "death" ?

This is nothing more than Ver/Wu paranoia. Layers like LN have different value than on-chain transactions. They don't devalue on-chain transactions, but give viability to new kinds of transactions (like micropayments) that would never meet onchain fee requirements in the first place.
The idea that LN or segwit is going to result in onchain fees reducing so miners make no money is fucking absurd. Segwit is going to allow many solutions of all kinds of function to be built on top of btc, all paying fees - and if anything the fear should be that with potential for infinite demand growth from these new apps and users who continue to need and want on chain transactions and no plans to increase blockspace, fees could go up!

A "web app" still needs to be downloaded, so I'm not sure I see your point. That software is typically of a larger disk size on desktops? While true, the reasons for this are related to the functions being performed more regularly on a desktop. The amount of data transferred over bandwidth or the size on disk of an installation are dictated by the app. You'll see desktop apps that are 1-2 MB (I love you HW Monitor), you'll see mobile apps that are hundreds of MB. You'll see apps that seem small at first but then gorge themselves on your bandwidth, you'll see apps that take forever to download and install but then barely touch your network connection at all.
Platform is entirely secondary to efficiency of design when we're talking about "how well does this work on a limited network connection or with restricted bandwidth or with a small fixed disk size".

There seems to be a fundamental detachment between your ability to associate action and consequence. Commit fraud -&gt; get money. No taxes -&gt; no police. This coupled with incoherent cognitive dissonance such as taxes equating to theft but break and enter home burglary isn't theft paints a picture of an unreasonable person who isn't having a debate, but espousing strongly held philosophy unsupported by basic facts or holding to the most shallow of critical thinking.

I am about to give some btc as a wedding present. It was discussed at length before the wedding including a lot of educating when it became clear this was something they were interested in. They were asking their guests in general for cash donations and when offered the choice between fiat and btc, they asked for the btc and a crash course in being their own bank. It's proven to be a lot more work than handing over $100, but sharing your passions is enjoyable so it's well worth it to me.
I wouldn't suggest a btc gift in pretty much any other circumstance. This only happened because of a persistent expressed interest and an explicit request for cash gifts.

This is not true, all evidence indicates Capitalism is far from an equalizer of wealth, it significantly concentrates wealth distribution in the hands of a few. All available examples demonstrate this tendency. Not because some people are more productive than others, but because capitalism is inherited wealth and opportunity.
The minuscule percentage of people who transition class in capitalism do so clearly not for reasons of merit - not because they "pulled themselves up by their bootstraps" - but more often because they were lucky. Networked with the right people, were in the right place at the right time. It isn't skill or ambition that seperated the rich and the poor and I know of no study supporting such a model of capitalism as being a system which delegates wealth based on who is wasteful and who is not, who is productive and who is not. Very far from it, capitalism isobservably generational wealth built on the backs of minimum wage labor.
My own anecdotes as one of the few to transition classes upwards conform to the idea I was lucky, not that I was so talented or productive that I deserved to move up in the world. Capitalism is absolutely not a meritocracy as you describe.
I don't  believe capitalism is the difference between a life free from coercion and one full of it. Coercion exists in capitalism. You must conform to the standards of your workplace, you must work what is available, not at the trade you wish. There are a lot of forms of coercion. Capitalism often presents bribery and profit motive as coercive elements for further example. It's why money governs capitalist politic.

Bitcoin is anti fragile. So long as there are people who understand the value of decentralization bitcoin will live, and understanding is a difficult thing to rob someone of. No amount of childish behaviour or ignorance is going to kill it because people who understand still live. It's the next generation of bitcoin users I worry about. I fear they will be so divorced from the concepts of decentralization which give bitcoin value they will turn it into another centralized payment processing tool.

Miners can withhold transactions by not mining them.

Has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin wasn't involved in the case at all and the woman took out cash from an ATM to give to a scammer would the police reasonably seize the money from the ATM owner?
Bitcoin doesn't enter into the part of this equation where liability is being cast on the ATM owner. It has nothing to do with anything. They could have never heard the word bitcoin before and it wouldn't have mattered in determining if the ATM owner was the scammer and thus could have their funds seized.

So just to be clear, your argument that the dollar is crashing is based entirely on the promotions offered by Subway and Little Ceasors as opposed to, say, the relative trading price of USD or the CPI? The dollar is inflating and it's doing so at a fairly predictable rate, but that's a far cry from the crash of fiat.
There are many factors which can affect the promotions a place like Subway would offer, not the least of which being rises to the minimum wage. Things like these don't reflect the crashing of the dollar in value.

I hope whatever evidence you may have of persons maliciously attacking bitcoin is made public in some way. I don't know what your relationship to your source is and obviously I wish no misfortune on anyone, but if you did have such information about prominent figures in the community it must be made known.  I'd view this obligation almost as some might "national security", as in a decentralized security model it seems the dissemination of  accurate information is critical to a secure network state (as evidence by this blocksize situation). That's just my own ethos, but to many of us I think this bitcoin project matters a great deal.

It's not an argument of last resort, and both arguments are true. It's not laws getting in the way of bitcoin services, it's banks denying accounts for fiat services. I've run an MSB in Canada and I'm currently working a fintech startup in the U.S. so I know it is for sure possible to run services legally AND I know it is impossible to enforce any kind of regulations on p2p activity. That's literally why bitcoin was designed the way it is.

So to be clear, your argument for why Bitcoin users should adopt bits is because America is the biggest bitcoin userbase and they find familiar pricing units of value in a similar format to USD.
Bitcoin is a global decentralized platform. There have been times when the US has not been the dominant market and there is no reason to expect they will continue to be tomorrow. Not that again, any of this matters because **culture does not drive the adoption of bitcoin units, function does**.

There are many alternatives, the first and foremost being not entering custodial bitcoin products and instead learning how to utilize the decentralized security model through the plethora of available resources.
Eventually institutions will use bitcoin and products built on top of it like liquid to reduce consumer risk by not being sole custodians. In this way even Grandma will be able to benefit from the security advantages of Bitcoin without ever using it. That is not what this product from Fidelity is. They are sole custodians, this is the old trust model not any new one.
What merit is there in getting Grandma to gamble on something she doesn't understand at all? What merit is there in empowering companies who would rob their users of the only unique benefit of engaging with bitcoin?
Grandma shouldn't get involved until she is ready. I tell everyone I recommend bitcoin to that they should take as much as a year and really make sure they understand it, and my advice to my grandmother would have been the same.

I don't disagree that there are many people with motive to disrupt bitcoin, some of which are actively working towards this. I don't think one of those people is Roger Ver. Unless you're aware of some evidence I'm not, it seems to me both the creation of this mass of rbtc users and their current position happened organically. Gavin started trying to push a move to bigger blocks, theymos stifled misinformed discussion(among other things), Ver took a very logical stance derived from his business experience, miners who are personally insulted act like it. It doesn't seem like the careful orchestration of a group of malicious altcoin investors but the logical human reaction to given contexts.

Luke is absolutely correct about JavaScript implementations being dangerous, even when all cryptography is happening client side. His concerns are not at all baseless.
Imagine using a version of Bitcoin Core that could update itself silently and without alerting you, any code could be injected into it without your knowledge. Would you consider that a safe piece of software for client side private key generation? I wouldn't.
People commenting about how well audited and reviewed some of these web wallet solutions are completely missing the point. It doesn't matter how well they are audited if I don't audit myself on every page load to be sure I am receiving the audited version of the code from the web server and not a malicious edit that hasn't been documented or audited.
The solution is simple. Instead of serving JS wallets over https serve them as standalone applications. This way the user knows their code isn't potentially being updated without their knowledge and the application has a much more conservative risk profile. It's not JS that's the problem, it's the delivery medium.

I agree, and it won't. Just like users don't need to understand TCP/IP to use the internet they won't need to understand Bitcoin to benefit from trustless Bitcoin services. When a company like Square chooses to back all deposits with BTC most users won't notice at all, to them it is just business as usual until square gets hacked or goes bankrupt but can't lose any user money because they aren't custodial, and even grandma can recover with her wealth intact by pressing a panic button or resolving as a function of a dead man's switch. That is the future of finance - people gaining properties of trust, transparency, insurance without changing anything they were otherwise doing.
The future of finance is not custodial Bitcoin from Coinbase or Square. Not your keys not your Bitcoin.

No, it seems it is you who doesn't understand the innovation of Bitcoin. You've got so many wrong ideas in your head, I would never be able to correct them all even if you did have an open mind. Instead we will just see that the proof is in the pudding: I think you are a moron and would never want to be associated with you or anything you have to do with - yet here I am using Bitcoin because the incentives align me to. Just as they align Bitmain to despite all their protestation and attacks. Just as they align you to.
It is truly beautiful that not even your ignorance can impact Bitcoin, you get to think whatever backwards things you choose to. The Nash equilibrium will keep you acting towards consensus regardless. Bitcoin is the consensus of competing and hostile actors who would wish failure on each other, but it doesn't matter in the least because they will work together for their own interest. There is no better alternative action.

The reality is Bitcoins incentive model strongly discourages change and encourages the status quo. As it stands BCH could be attacked at will for lack of security actors. To call it "pretty much the exact same" as bitcoin is to ignore entirely how the decentralized security model functions.

An etf that is backed by an asset is just holding positions for their customers, they have no need to dump the asset if they get bearish because they hold no liability they just deliver the asset at settlement. It's not going to end up being their asset they are just taking fees and were paid for the asset already. If an etf did close their clients positions unilaterally I am sure it would be the end of that etf and the beginning of many lawsuits.
Many etfs have their own assets to provide liquidity for backed products. In that case if they want to sell, it's theirs to sell so long as the rules governing them allow it. The Winklevoss twins could dump tomorrow if they choose to. They may have to keep a specific volume available for their financial product, but anything not tied to a position is theirs.
If it is unbacked they never have to acquire the asset. Each position is offset by an equal and opposite position. If I offer a sell on a etf future and someone buys it, there are now an equal buy and sell on the books. At settlement the buys and the sells must necessarily cancel each other out, you can't have a buy without a sell. You just deliver the money the users were gambling proportionally to the winners from the losers.

2.

Companies were responsible for the unilateral fork attempts imposed by the NYA and S2X, and the existence of BCH at all. They consulted no engineering or technical resources, a handful of entrepreneurs tried to decide what Bitcoin consensus is and shove it down everyone else's throats. Less than a year ago.

It is being ruined. It's a group of companies:
* custodially holding their users bitcoin creating an enormous security risk by pooling a large amount of funds with a single point of failure
* attempting to influence the Bitcoin protocol unilaterally (Square wasn't a part of this directly, but only because they weren't even in the space. 90+% of the net worth of the companies in this space attempted to fork us)
* imposing restrictions on use and blacklisting addresses and services
* advertising to their users they are using Bitcoin when in reality they are never interacting with either bitcoin tokens or the Bitcoin network.
Can you accept that if a decentralized network is to grow it must have real users interacting through decentralized layers as opposed to a small handful of internationally successful centralized intermediaries?
They are removing the value proposition of bitcoin by operating as a centralized layer on top of it and selling that layer as bitcoin. You don't think that's wrong? If that layer is what grows in adoption and not Bitcoin or decentralized layers then Bitcoin hasn't grown at all.

There are some serious problems with the way the cost is calculated. They take the market hash price at nicehash and extrapolate how much it would cost to double the current hashrate. They don't include the profit of mining reward against the cost.
The biggest problem with this is that it ignores the insane market event of buying 1 bitcoin networks worth of hash power for an hour is. Is that much for sale? Not even close, 1%.  Even if there were 1 bitcoin networks worth of miners available to rent for an hour, it would be one of the greatest feats in history to somehow get all of the available for rent miners to hash for you, as you direct (in an obviously malicious manner), **without moving the market price of hash power beyond what the market currently projects**. The cost will be so much more than this for a 1 hour window of 1 bitcoin networks worth of hashing power (if it existed).
Only reliable attack is one where you own the miners - otherwise the community will cry and have the pool ban you as a customer. Cost is going to be orders of magnitude higher than 400k for a 1 hour window of attack.

In what warped world do you live in where merchants would require a bespoke commerce platform to accept bitcoin? You're speaking absolute nonesense. The programming task of integrating BitPay merchant tools or Coinbase merchant tools is perfectly comparable to the task of setting up BTCPay and configuring it to send a given amount to the exchange(s) of your choice. Literally the exact same steps except in one instance you're trusting Coinbase or BitPay with your coins instead of yourself.


It's so difficult to talk to you. None of this is based on anything other than your perception - which is wrong. There are open source NFC tools, NFC Bitcoin tools, scan and pay wallet integrations for every major CMS on the planet. They are open source and aren't holding your coins with some third party. You are just plain wrong about the availability of tools or the idea that centralized for-profit UX is inherently more capable than open source UX.
This conversation is painful. I can honestly not handle your ignorance to the ecosystem. Have you ever engaged in it at all? Ever set up a BTCPay server? Run a node? Been a BTC merchant? I don't think you have the slightest clue what you're talking about.

BTCPay is literally a clone of the BitPay API. Decentralized and centralized exchanges expose API's. There is no argument to be made that coinbase or square or BitPay merchant services are necessary. Allowing these parasitic centralized companies to attempt to dictate the direction of either Bitcoin as a protocol or an end user experience is unacceptable. These companies must fail.
You are stuck thinking in the same paradigm as these companies are, thinking they will take on PayPal or Amazon. What a very sad vision for what the world's most revolutionary financial asset will accomplish - the replacing of one centralized financial entity governed by US law with another. If that is all Bitcoin ever amounts to, a prop for companies like coinbase to hoist themselves up with, Bitcoin will have failed as a decentralized network of trust.

Because the logistics of running a mining operation aren't trivial, though some power companies especially in China are. In most instances it's simpler to let other businesses take the BTC risks and just sell them power at an elevated rate or with special terms for disconnection. In for example Quebec Canada they are ramping up an enormous number of mining operations using hydroelectric because it enables the power company to better distribute their electricity during peak times and profit from high rate and disconnectable customers. In Alberta there is a company that sells refurbished shipping containers full of miners and cooling that run on natural gas waste - allowing for additional resource usage that would otherwise be uneconomical and go directly to the atmosphere as pollution.  Most power plants produce more than is being used, and you just identified one of the major ways BTC will be beneficial to the power generating industries. Power plants have to exist before populations do, and the vast majority of their capacity is wasted until usage levels balance off. Bitcoin reduces energy waste, it reduces brown outs, it enriches energy companies, it enables otherwise uneconomical electricity products, and it results in a more reliable power grid for everyday citizens.

I'd rather have a huge risk free boon for my company than a super risky but higher paying off venture.
It's also a conflict of interest. The power companies, often publicly owned, are supposed to serve the broader population. That means turning off mining customers during peak demand to avoid brown outs. If you are running the mining operations you might be in a position where you have to shoot yourself in the foot. let someone else take the risk.

Its a function of demand for blockspace, which is not uniformly distributed over time. In some instances that demand even includes manufactured demand - spam. This isn't one of those instances, this just looks like a large batch of transactions driven by demand.

Any mechanism of enforcing:


through rule change as opposed to miner supermajority will cause a hard fork, as other clients will include blocks that are not empty when evaluating the chain with the most proof of work. If your new clients reject the chain with the most PoW because they are still producing blocks that are not empty, it would cause a hard fork. By choosing to not include blocks that have transaction content you are forking away from those that maintain the current consensus rules unless you have a super majority of miners.
If you had a true soft fork where some nodes agreed to provide additional features beyond the base bitcoin protocol, I'd consider that a different network layer even if they were the same participants. Transactions are being recorded but not on the bitcoin blockchain or they would have to be in a block and recorded by nodes, it's happening either off chain or side chain. On a level this is similar to how segwit works, except it segregates the witness data.

That is possibly the worst application of the most inefficient shared global data store I have ever heard. There is a reason we don't just explode the blockchain size and let you shove whatever you want in it.
To have what you want is to destroy the properties you value like immutability, longevity, and security. If you don't believe me Ethereum and bcash are both destroying their blockchains in this way, to the point ethereum will completely abandon their original chain.

This is EXACTLY why Bitcoin is good for the energy sector. If you have interruptible customers like Bitcoin miners it allows you to better balance the energy grid for peak demand times which are common, it allows you to commoditize unused generation capacity without storage or transmission problems, it makes viable power production methods that otherwise would be out-competed or thrown to waste.

If there is such a group of people able to come to "objectively true and independently derivable" TA conclusions I don't know of it and they would be the exception not the rule.
If something is objectively true and accurate then it should be repeatable and independently verifiable. TA in Bitcoin doesn't meet that standard. Its movements are not based either on the psychological state of the markets, the "trend" of the market, nor an underlying companies fundamentals. It has moved for years now based on crazy supply distribution, protocol state, and speculation on a unique asset class. These factors are fundamentally different from what drives TA.

Graphics cards aren't effective miners, and organized pools would be able to identify that they were not mining on the main chain any longer which would cause community outrage and either a miner exodus from the pool or more likely the pool returning to honest behavior. It would be self destroying before it ever got off the ground.
Similarly a virus that siphoned 51% of hashing from ASIC's would be noticed and disabled immediately. that's an over half reduction in profits you don't think EVERYONE is going to notice that with the way people check their bitcoin stuff? Not to mention, you'll never infect every mining device on the planet.

Many of us aren't traders at all and you are right we aren't cut out for it - we're technology enthusiasts. To try to trade is how we see many of our peers bankrupt themselves. You're gambling on the price - which is why to you it makes perfect sense to sell high and buy lower. We'd rather be gambling on the binary state of will this be a successful and adopted technology - because it's the only area we have any insight into. Trying to maximize the enormous potential gains of winning our binary bet by maximizing when we buy in doesn't actually return that significant a difference in return potential but is a huge difference in risk exposure. By actively trading instead of holding you risk being wrong, and missing the start of the next insane bullrun. it happens to traders here all the time. No one is perfect and the market is very unpredictable - any gains you make min/maxing your position are lost to slippage buying back in if you are *ever* significantly wrong.
To that end we follow some simple rules to place our bet on the long term adoption of this technology:
1. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
2. Dollar cost average in during dips, never going full exposure.
3. Don't trade with any effective leverage. (use leveraged products, but keep enough reserve from your willing-to-lose stash to cover the leverage and deleverage to 1:1 if necessary)
4. Since you haven't invested your full "all I am willing to lose" amount ever - **don't sell**. Just keep dollar cost averaging the dips - for years if necessary.
What this does is it structures a bet of "will there be another bitcoin bubble in the future". If you bet yes, follow these simple rules and even with no trading or market awareness you can profit. If you want to bet "will Bitcoin be a successful adopted technology", keep holding through the bubbles. I'd much much rather make a gamble on "will there be another bitcoin bubble" than "what is the price of bitcoin going to be tomorrow"

I don't believe those are the most commonly used definitions outside ethereum. I believe most bitcoin node runners would simply use "full" when referring to what you call archival and "pruned".

We don't need to borrow from ethereum's language, we were here first and already have the necessary language.

That's such a difficult thing to get a grasp on - the short term. buy/hold versus waiting.  Bitcoin could do anything tomorrow - be manipulated any way tomorrow.
Long term is easy. If you're willing to hold through a 4 year period (a halvening+some) I'd say it doesn't matter when you buy in - you'll be looking good sometime. Often you'll be looking good for a long time. The trick will be not selling until the 1-3 week hyper bull market has come and gone - and selling before price collapses again. So many people sold in January 2017 because the ETF was rejected. So many people sold in July/August 2017 because of fork and scaling fears. So many people sold September - December 2017 as they hit their individual "moons" and cashed out. And so many didn't - either by intent or by missing the chance. I think if you're planning to gamble to make significant profit for your firm I would much rather gamble that Bitcoin will bubble in the next 4-5 years than I would what Bitcoin will do in the next 365 days.
The short term game though, that's tough. If you're going to look for short term assurances you put observation on all major bitcoin wallets and you observe the supply with the eye of a hawk. You watch futures and leveraged products and interest rates. If you're going to be gambling you should stack the deck in your favor as much as possible by informing yourself of every variable possible - and supply is a uniquely observable property on a blockchain. Automated trading and stop loss strategies have to be key, disaster recovery and exchange choice should be based around track records and your own auditing. You should use leveraged products like those at BitMex(excellent security practices) to avoid your entire trading balance sitting on an exchange. You may not be doing full on trading, but if your goal is to answer the question "is it going to be lower soon? and if not can I buy in now?" you should use the same tools.
A lot of people win amazingly at the short term game. Many more lose everything - often due to factors entirely out of their control like ddos on exchanges, exchange fraud or theft, or market manipulation. Play the long game. It's more profitable anyways. 
TLDR: Thinking about what the opportunity cost of buying Bitcoin when it is at 40% of its all time high or 35% is just silly. The really opportunity cost is not buying in at all or missing the boat. Those are the people who panic buy the top. Do not be those people. Buy some exposure now. Buy more later if it goes lower. Hold for 4 years. Profit.

You do actually have to restructure a linked list if you remove an element. To remove an element is to change the linked lists previous and next node pointers, and possibly the begining pointer.

The right community is right here. Bitcoin is politically agnostic. It's a tool, like a hammer. The hammer nor discussion communities about hammers care what your politics are.
Lots of libertarians are attracted to the properties of liberty bitcoin enables and espouses. Bitcoin was created in response to political contexts and the creator made clear some political views like their thoughts on fractional reserve banking. The genesis block even includes a newspaper headline involving bank bailouts. But libertarian minded folks are hardly the only users.
The truth is we get as many posts about Richard Wolff as we do Hayek (as relates to bitcoin or the economics of bitcoin). Polls trying to examine the political makeup of bitcoin users find their beliefs vary across the political spectrum. IMO Bitcoin has a larger gender bias than it does a political one.

It's a segwit address, you're seeing only very limited and recent results, not what he's scammed over the last 16 years. Probably only what he's scammed a small number of people with. You have no means with which to estimate how successful he has or hasn't been. All you could do was give this address to law enforcement agencies in countries where he interacts with an exchange, and maybe someone would have caught him. You're relying on him to make a mistake to catch him, and you're announcing everything you know before you have him. Now he won't make those mistakes.
Edit: Good call deleting. Get in contact with authorities in any jurisdiction he is operating in and hope he makes a mistake associating his identity to some fraud profits. Good luck.

LN users will most likely be buying goods and services as this is the most obvious and frequently opined use case for 0-conf, and thus LN users represent an eventual bitcoin divestment somewhere down the supply chain. In this way LN is primarily a downward price pressure.
Unless this increased "selling" of BTC through the LN is offset by an equal amount of purchasing to hold bitcoin and act as a lightning node, or an increase in the transactional volume of bitcoin significant enough to require an increase in bitcoin valuation to store the transactional volume, then the net effect of LN will likely be a downwards price movement at least in the short term. If people who are already holding bitcoin and not spending compose the majority of LN locked funds, or if the network doesn't rapidly scale in new users and transactional volume, LN will necessarily be a downward pressure on price if used by end users at any scale.

You've mistaken decentralized for distributed. You are describing distributed, even redundancy - not decentralized. Decentralization requires no central points of authority or failure. 
The internet is not decentralized, it's distributed. There is a small group of authorities (exceptionally small relative to the whole of the internet using population) able to describe the speed of the network, whether nodes are communicating on the network at all, manipulate data traveling through those nodes. There are a small number of infrastructures which, when disabled, isolate the internet geographically. 
That's not decentralized. The internet network is fault tolerant and distributed for certain, but it isn't decentralized. Decentralized protocols solving the Byzantine generals problem we're only proven plausible with the advent of PoW and Blockchain.
So you're right, there is a misconception about what decentralization means - and you're contributing to it.

One GF even broke up with me over it, demanding if I loved her I would have dumped my BTC "for us". They all shut right up in 2017 and many have since bought some of their own. It helps having a significant knowledge about bitcoin and how it functions, my colleagues were for sure the first to make the positive turn after many technical discussions.

I don't consider the issue to be one of promoting competing chains or projects, that's not what that post is.
We remove a lot of off topic content, though frankly no one is really talking about Craig outside that single meme post which is popular enough that it's hard to justify removing. Similarly with the gold one that was at the top the day before where the entire threads content was basically a collective shitting on the mods and the sub (despite very few reports).

I can't speak for anyone else but IMO the low quality memes are the most difficult to mod. Unlike repetitive content or off topic content they often shoot straight to the top of the page, and their "quality" is often subjective. I'm sorry that having a single meme on the front page that mentions craig has impacted your r/bitcoin experience, but with a sub this big and passionate that's sometimes just how it has to go.

You seem to have severely misunderstood what Bitcoin is.
It is not a protocol for *price consensus*. You may think of the markets that trade its token as that, but that's not either what the token represents or what the protocol is designed to achieve consensus for. The consensus is one of state, not price, and the means of consensus being validation rules and hashpower, not market activity.
You are so focused on bitcoin (little b) that you have completely ignored Bitcoin (big B) which is where bitcoin's token value is derived. You're missing the forest for the trees. Without the protocol being robust and full of economic and security actors there is no token value to even speculate on and the properties of money you value never emerge.
Stop thinking of Bitcoin like a business or marketplace and all the things you "don't get" like "why aren't lower fee coins more competitive?" immediately make sense. They aren't competitive because they have neither the same kind of decentralized state consensus as Bitcoin or they lack it's protocol participants. The fees don't matter near as much as people like you think they do, the fees aren't what make bitcoin unique. It will ALWAYS be cheaper to update a centralized datastore's state than a decentralized  one, you shouldn't be using fees as your barometer of value in this space.
As for all the specific use cases you list, they are only use cases that matter if your cryptocurrency is actually decentralized and unassailable. Otherwise you have actors like the SEC stepping it like they did with ethereum and forced the dao fork. A uniquely decentralized protocol has to come first, and no other coin comes close to Bitcoin in that regard. It's the only thing of value in this entire space.

Bitcoin, really any monetary policy, is a tool. Like all money it can be used for applications across the entire moral and political spectrum - to oppress and liberate. As a tool to oppress however it's a poor substitute for traditional fiat and always enables the liberation of users to a global economy removed from their local one.
It's not a tool for removing or even improving wealth inequality. Bitcoins function isn't to stop unethical applications of money or evenly redistribute wealth - and IMO that's fine. Some problems are social, not technical.

You think users should be running and managing multiple lightning nodes and locking up funds redundantly between them and "lightning rod" nodes? All while lightning senders funds are now, instead of being lightning fast, held in prolonged limbo?
I can't agree at all. If this became popular I would want my lightning node to warn me before filling such an invoice so I could choose not to.
Lightning requires you be online to use and to be secure. Watchtower and channel closing locktimes are a means to deal with connectivity issues and brief absences from the network, not a means of enabling often offline nodes securely. To me that's the end of the story.

A lot of opinions about bitcoin are grossly misinformed across the entire world and political spectrum. Bitcoin is a new paradigm and touches on cross discipline complexities. People don't understand. They think it has an environmental problem despite it being the largest consumer of renewables curtailment in the world with a total carbon footprint between 10 and 20 MT CO2 equivalent according to three independent research sources in Coinshares, Cambridge, and the IEA. They also think it needs to be regulated due to a fundamental misunderstanding about how bitcoin functions and the game theory factors/cryptography securing it. To a degree they are right without knowing it, custodial companies need regulation, not bitcoin, but they don't understand enough to make the distinction.
While this group of people covers every background and expertise, the brilliant and the dumb, it also includes two people I deeply respect in Chomsky and Wolff. You can search the sub for their comments. In wolff's case it devolves into comparisons to centralized companies like uber "innovating" to find ways to pay people less and skirt regulators. He has entirely misunderstood that there are no employees being abused by a company that is "bitcoin". That doesn't invalidate anything else he thinks, but it does mean he has no clue how bitcoin functions. between the depth of understanding and research required to "get" bitcoin and with typically dismissive thoughts about its environmental impact or lack of government oversight, it's very easy to dismiss or not seriously consider. The lefts leaders have been slow to come around, but that's fine. I don't need people I respect to understand every subject or never be wrong.

No it's not bad because it's corporate, we need corporations who employ people and create revenue and taxes and society. This is something new, decentralization. We need it too, because it can reduce our need to trust our peers. One doesn't replace the other, they are congruent. Why in the world would we want to ruin this new thing by making it exactly like the thing we already have? Both are valuable, replicating the resource we already have is a waste of time when there is something new and complimentary to our existing resources we could have.
Coinbase et al are constantly moving the crypto ecosystem closer to the traditional centralized structure. Why in the world would that be a good thing? Has nothing to do with them being corporations - I've worked for many corporations and most people do. Has to do with them destroying a unique and valuable space with their ignorance and narrow thinking. Much as your thinking is narrow.

But by your own definition pruned nodes ARE full nodes. You don't have three definitions you still only have two - archival and pruned - and you are defining both as full. I expect the only "nodes" you wouldn't consider full aren't so much nodes at all but SPV or neutrino clients.
Archival nodes aren't merely for archival purposes. The intent is to be the functional infrastructure of the bitcoin network and the default node configuration. Calling them archival nodes plays into the idea being perpetuated by the ethereum camp that archival nodes are largely unnecessary, they are just for archiving transactions for your personal use. "Full" on the other hand can imply not only fully validating but has the full blockchain and is a full bitcoin service provider.
Doesn't really matter at the end of the day, it's literally a semantic argument. Call ~~archival~~ full nodes unicorn farts if it's what gets people running one.

I'm a developer. I've been engaged in bitcoin and cryptocurrency for 4 years. I'm heavily invested in the success of bitcoin. Are you suggesting that the people who don't agree with you such as myself are missing some obvious truth? I think it's more likely you're missing a nuanced truth, and that truth is that security and network integrity must always come first as they are the value of the protocol and token.
I fully expect the economic context of bitcoin to change. I expect common use cases to shift, I expect that some things that are currently possible will at some point be less viable and new use cases will emerge. This truth really bothers some people and they are very keen to fight it, but there is no fighting it. It's just the contextual reality. The technical reality. The economic reality.

All of the issues you describe are really the same singular issue: bad operational security.
First, you should never let your keys or seed touch an online device, always sign air gapped. That removes the possibility of about 6 of these issues.
Next use the right security model for your needs. Typically you should tier your wallets like you would other money. Keep a small amount highly accessible and the majority highly inaccessible. For small amounts use a hardware wallet, and if a family member steals it along with your pin somehow it is a lesson worth the few hundred dollars it at most cost. If you are talking long term cold storage requiring high security use something like  which includes provisions for an arbitrary number of multisig keys meaning if you lose a few or forget their passwords it's not a huge deal. It also means you can disperse keys to loved ones without fear they can steal your coins until you die since they would need more than just the key you gave them. You can even disperse keys to remote locations making it very time consuming and impossible for someone to impulsively steal. You can also timelock bitcoin, making it so they won't move at all until a given block height. 
Finally, don't store your keys in plaintext. Encrypt them. Then the issue of losing them is substantially less severe and your coins can't be stolen until the encryption is cracked or removed. If you are worried about forgetting your passwords keep a reminder somewhere unrelated and obfuscated.
I also think you've ignored a lot of security issues with cash and gold. How can I safely transport significant sums of it for example? It's big and heavy and obvious I am moving it, I can only fit so many thousands of dollars in my pockets and have it not be obvious. What about the courts being used against you to confiscate your wealth? Or the government, or even just the banks confiscating or freezing it? Confiscated at borders, legal and illegal checkpoints, and can be found with a simple search of a person. You can lose it, destroy it accidentally. Every time I've ever been robbed it was for fiat, not bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a protocol of consensus. The valuable properties come from the people engaging in that protocol. Developmentally, economically, and as security actors. It is not a business or stock and does not succeed or fail under the same conditions.

I think you're conflating wallet provider and last hop routing node.
I'll be honest  this setup seems really impractical. I have no way to make sure my last hop provider is always a single party running this service unless I have only one channel open. Also, for practical reasons of usability, invoices typically have relatively short expiry times. LND defaults to 3600 seconds I believe.
Lightning requires users to be online to secure and use their channels, even with watchtowers and long channel close times you should be online as much as is possible. This whole idea seems backwards. Lightning isn't an offline service.

There are degrees of immutability. Bitcoins immutability comes from PoW. Attacks cost money and are of limited impact. Those properties don't come from a blockchain, but the cost to append to the blockchain. A private blockchain has no such cost.
You are better suited comparing private blockchains to linked lists in terms of immutability than you are comparing them to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an entire other beast and unique immutability model, private blockchains aren't doing anything we haven't been able to do for decades. Most often doing it in the most absurd and inefficient way possible. To say Bitcoin isn't perfectly immutable is to miss the enormous gulf in mutability between things like constant variables, linked lists, private blockchains, and then PoW Bitcoin on the entire opposite end of the spectrum.

A shill doesn't require being paid as their incentive to shill.
My opinion wasn't based on a single badly handled cheque, but the many factors I have listed in this discussion. As I already note, I didn't stop using Quadriga until the withdrawals started getting cancelled and delayed and there was an acknowledged eth hack. All of that coupled with the lack of any physical office or public communication methods, the constant horror stories emerging from the other quadriga users, and the growing narrative of seized funds from CIBC further informed the evidence users should exit the exchange. That Quadriga was having solvency issues. This is the exact argument we were having which devolved into the semantic argument about the definition of solvency. You heard this exact warning and were so upset by it that you are still arguing with me about it to this day.

I've been actively telling people to get out of Quadriga for a year now to the point where I have been banned from every Quadriga controlled platform and probably risk legal repercussions if my claims had been inaccurate. From my perspective in the trenches it's non-stop talk about the fraud being perpetuated by Quadriga.

There is one principle that the hostile attack on consensus involving the NYA, BCH fork, segwit, UASF and S2X all demonstrated -  the Nash equilibrium securing Bitcoin works. Even when the participants want to claw each others eyes out, when they would much rather engage in attacks and misinformation campaigns and shady politics than work together, they will still keep supporting and mining Bitcoin. The incentives of the network keep everyone more or less in line. Bitmain still mines BTC, all the NYA companies still get most of their business from BTC. They need bitcoin.
So huff and puff all you want, threaten to blow the house down. The next time nearly every company of significance in this space and the majority of miners decide bitcoin is theirs to define the rest of the network participants won't blink.

They were touting [50k+ sign ups a day the last bullrun](  and there are only [~56k Bitcoin nodes pruned/full/listening/non-listening]( The maximum number of SPV connections per full node is 20, and reality is somewhere much lower. Necessarily the vast majority of their users never interact with the protocol. They also touted this themselves in the scaling debate, falsely claiming they represented millions of Bitcoin users.

He says when the price is down it's a good opportunity to stock up more. How does that equate to never selling or imply that the price is the reason he is a perma bull?
Your entire view is warped. He's 100% correct.
You should always be buying bitcoin regardless of the price - a view he doesn't say but you impose on him. He literally is saying buy when the price is down to stock up, but that aside for a moment. As someone who has been buying regardless of price for over half of Bitcoins life let me tell you, it's a pretty great savings strategy whether you're buying at 20k or 3k. I'm beating the hell out of those traders who keep trying to find the bottoms and tops.
Even if it wasn't about price - I buy because I want to control my own wealth. Do I buy more when the price is low? I do. Do I buy less when the price is 20k? A bit less, yep. I'm still always buying because I always have use for more.

Yes it is distributed exactly as it should be to achieve decentralization as a network state, the only way we know how to achieve decentralization, but there are some consequences to this which can be roundly described as 'unfair'. Is considering two ideas simultaneously such a stretch for your mind that you immediately have a fit? A lot of medicine has side effects too you know, do you throw your hands in the air whenever someone says their medication is working but they haven't had a solid shit in 2 weeks too?
I'm not sure why noting that most of us, myself included, are white males set you off so badly.


1. You need an education and a general interest to even comprehend the white paper. That excludes an enormous percentage of the population right there.
2. You either needed to be gpu/cpu mining in a very small window of time and have the luxury of a capable computer, or already have a degree of wealth to invest in the broader time frames. Again severely limiting the likely participant pool.
These things are all as they should be for the desired effect of creating a decentralized network, but to pretend that they are fair attributes of a currency or wealth distribution is just silly. There is nothing cognitively dissonant about being aware of the mechanisms by which bitcoin achieves decentralization and the side effects those mechanisms simultaneously create. Cognitive dissonance is seeing only one of those two things, whether its the bitcoiner who thinks they are brilliant because they invested early and it is their sheer brilliance that has landed them their deserved fortune or its a crazed socialist who thinks they are going to start their own communist centralized blockchain to address perceived inequality.

Different tools for different use cases. No matter what OS you are using you still need to properly configure it for your use case.
I like tails live for intermittent and personal use involving sensitive info.
I like Ubuntu desktop for casual web use, development, and media management.
I like CentOS for business services.
I like Windows for VR and gaming.
None of these options says much about the security beyond the default configurations. It's how you apply software that determines its security properties. That's my entire point. These discussions of OS as security in place of how that OS is configured or what it is running are entirely the wrong discussion. Implying to anyone that installing a given OS is enough to keep you safe is just wrong.

Bitcoin is a protocol that is strictly defined. Not an ideology. It isn't gatekeeping to point out that people using Coinbase are not participants in that protocol, it's a statement of facts.

You don't need to run a node to be a bitcoin user though it is strongly recommended. If you do I suggest not buying a hosted account and running a node, but instead running a node from your home  if possible. Many nodes already exist in data centers around the world, and both the network and yourself personally are better served by you being entirely in control of your node, the hardware it runs on, and its connection.

Bitcoin fees are based on the size of the transaction, we measure them in satoshi per byte. Not all transactions are the same size. A transaction of 2 btc that has many smaller inputs will be larger than a transaction of a single 2 btc input. Similarly a transaction from a segwit wallet will be smaller than a transaction from other address types.
When more people are requesting transactions than can be put in a single block - or when miners choose to not include as many transactions as they possibly could - a fee market develops. Transactions such as yours are put in memory while people willing to pay more per byte than you effectively jump in front of the line. Sometimes this lasts a few hours, sometimes days. In the event of attacks or extremely high use it could go on for even longer.
You can yourself jump forward in the line by using a replace by fee (RBF) transaction which is a way to make that same transactions currently in the back of the line but with a higher fee, invalidating the old transaction.

Using an exchange as an exchange isn't the problem. The issue is how many people think an exchange account is a bitcoin account and don't ever actually see their own private key. Nothing wrong with using an exchange, I would just never direct a new user to start there. The exchanges want you to keep your money with them, they will never caution you to the risks or teach you anything about bitcoin. Bitcoin is being your own bank. Users should start by making a plan as to how they intend to be their own bank and what that will mean in their circumstance.

I get that you think there wasn't enough information.  That's because you are only satisfied with a firm provable conclusion. I started telling people not to keep their funds in Quadriga 4 years ago because I was appalled by their security practices and general operating procedures. I didn't feel safe keeping my money there and I wanted other people to know why. I didn't go so far as to say stop using them, simply to never keep funds there. In January when withdrawals became delayed post eth hack and it soon became clear billerfy was bust I started recommending people stop using the exchange all together.
Again, none of that is conclusive evidence of anything. They are instead the classic warning signs of a failing exchange. Delayed withdrawals, known careless operators, known poor operational practices like requiring 5 figure deposits be left with random strangers unassociated to the business with a disappearing public presence.
To expect conclusive evidence as the warning sign to leave an exchange is unreasonable.
I did call you a shill, a liar, and dangerous. I strongly stand by those statements. A single post ago you were ready to hang me as an insider based on some flimsy research. While it may not have been your intent to provide false hope or justifications to stay in Quadriga, you did actively post all over reddit defending Quadriga and attacking anyone critical as a buttcoiner.

Under what conditions would you consider your judgement possibly flawed? Lay out for me the terms by which you would consider changing your mind or hearing reasonable argument, because your views about what defines a fork and makes something "no longer bitcoin" would strongly imply that hard forks which occurred previous to this one came from coins which you do not consider bitcoin. I see no way to rationalize your position on the XT fork not being bitcoin while still believing that bitcoin was still bitcoin before previous hard forks. It seems by your unreasonably narrow definition the only real bitcoin network is the one that has existed since the last hard fork, and whatever it was before that was not bitcoin.
If you have some qualifier for what makes this fork substantively different, I ask what would need to happen to make it the same in your all-powerful-and-uniquely-capable-of-rational-judgement eyes.
You already made an absurd argument regarding the tyranny of the majority citing historical precedents so I know that the majority consensus isn't going to change your mind, and while I will be the first to say this community is a zeal with pitchforks and no reason them being that way doesn't make you or your line of reasoning any more correct.

You're right, all the base properties of bitcoin provide extremely libertarian focused function. Does that mean countries couldn't begin using bitcoin as a reserve currency? That budgets and national governance couldn't occur on a sidechain which resolved its state to the bitcoin blockchain? I personally see bitcoin as a great liberator. It will enable libertarian minded individuals the freedom they seek and plausibly socialist minded individuals the accountability and transparency features to build similarly liberating toolsets. Socialisms biggest fault is a lack of mechanisms to hold those in power accountable, and as with all power arrangements a predisposition to corruption. All models of governance socialist or not have a great deal to potentially gain as bitcoin and the layers built on top of it mature.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:47:41
Bitcoin doesn't end corruption or illegal activity, it evens the playing field between the wealthy and the not by giving them the same corrupt tools. 
The reason bitcoin has value from a socialist perspective is that as a decentralized medium it is difficult for the corrupt to influence. I foresee a future where mechanisms of self governance, national governance, transparency and audibility all occur via sidechains and additional layers which all resolve to bitcoin thus taking advantage of its decentralization. Bitcoin itself may not have many properties which enable a socialist agenda, but it does have decentralization. That's the really hard get.

If so, why only these few coins? I am struggling to come up with satoshi's rational for moving these coins. All it does is effectively demonstrate his coins are not lost, especially since he moved coins that could only be owned by him. If he just wanted 200 coins why not take it from the more muddled tail end of his mining career? Unless there was some security issue specifically effecting a few very early addresses there is no reason to consolidate those few coins.

Most SPV wallets trust only the companies server that made the wallet. Electrum and some others trust any third party.

Exactly as it is. The distribution mechanism of mining is a necessary evil which enhances our decentralization by addressing attack vectors and creating a nash equilibrium of honest acting network agents. The desired currency properties of immediate resolution and fair distribution can be achieved in additional layers - the way altcoins are attempting to do now except anchored to the decentralized state of the bitcoin blockchain.

You have completely misunderstood. The fact that anyone can spin up a node does not discount the security function of self validation and consensus that nodes provide. Identifying and blocking nodes which exist solely as propaganda pieces as opposed to validation and propagation agents of the network is an important and healthy defensive function.
It's funny to watch people who have so little understanding of the security properties of the network, like yourself, act so superior while knowing so little.

I don't suggest the opposite, I suggest that being your own bank enables those who don't want to be their own bank. That brewers enable beer consumers. You need these tools to create the gradient of functions and trust that can be exposed to the consumer without their awareness.
I am suggesting that by prioritizing being your own bank we enable end user functionality that is steps removed from being your own bank.
Banks will continue to be banks but with lower trust. Anyone will be able to be their own trustless bank. The futures aren't mutually exclusive and both rely on the existence of the being your own bank use case.

It's bad advice, I'm just pointing that out. Coinbase is not a company that should be thrown business by this community as they have spearheaded several anti-bitcoin practices and is the exact opposite of 'the best way to get started' with bitcoin. You want to invest? Use an investment fund like GBTC. You want to buy and use bitcoin? Buy bitcoin on an exchange (like Coinbase if you must) and withdraw - but even then that's not where you start. You start with the white paper, you start by learning how to secure your own coins. Telling people to just go and use Coinbase breeds the horrible practices we've seen of users exposing themselves to long term counterparty risk as well as gives this dangerous company more weight in their future attempts to subvert the bitcoin protocol for their own ends.

A node which will relay invalid blocks at a planned point in the future will isolate pockets of the network harming connectivity for all and is a clearly hostile action against the networks infrastructure.. A node is not a node is not a node when they do not follow the same consensus rules. To preemptively identify and ban nodes which are signalling intent to change consensus rules is a proactive and reasonable precaution to aviod the aformentioned bubbles of isolation caused by the mass relaying of invalid blocks. Frankly that btc1 does not isolate their network is itself at best irresponsible and at worst a willful attack against those who do not wish to "upgrade" the network.
The consequence of not isolating the networks is well documented by both sides at this point, with the pro 2x side doing so to incentivize adoption by creating risk associated to not adopting. Just as is the policy on replay protection. The only uneducated person here is you.

Your wallet will give you a private key or a pass phrase which equates to your private key.
When you create a bitcoin wallet your computer will create a private key and a corresponding public key. These keys are tied together. Your public key is your address, like an email address, and anyone wanting to send you bitcoin sends it to your public key. When you withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange you will send it to your public key.
When it comes time for you to send your bitcoin from your wallet you will need your private key. Once loaded into your wallet the private key will "sign a transaction" using some math, to prove that you control the funds associated to the corresponding public key. This signed proof gets sent to the bitcoin network and thats how bitcoin gets transfered. Your private key is the ownership of your bitcoins at the corresponding public key address.
You know thr saying ownership is 9/10ths the law? In bitcoin its 100% of the law. You are responsible for protecting your passphrase or private keys because if someone gets them they own your bitcoins.

I'm not claiming to know how bitcoin will play out in the future, I'm claiming to have a strong understanding of the properties of decentralization. Bitcoin gold has pretty much 0 chance of replacing bitcoin or becoming decentralized, it's a premine coin with an unstable blockchain that is going to have to compete with every other gpu coin on the market for network security. It has absolutely no developer support. It's a cash grab. pretending that it has the chance to usurp bitcoin as the king of decentralization is outright absurd.
So I suppose that on top of claiming an understanding of decentralization, I'm also claiming bitcoin gold is a joke as an extension of that understanding. Hardly predicting the future, more like observing reality.

This is false and based on a radical definition of socialism put forward by US classrooms in a cold war era.
From the definition of socialism:
Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. **Social ownership may refer to forms of public (state corporations), collective or cooperative ownership (co-ops), or to citizen ownership of equity**. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them, though social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.

The best wallet is an offline non-custodial one. You want to control your own keys. These wallets let you set your own fees based on the priority of your transaction. Blockchain.info has a horrible reputation in this regard. The "wallets" you're talking about are online service providers trying to be one stop shops for everything and especially trying to get you to let them hold your bitcoin on your behalf.

Don't worry too much, bitcoin is pretty confusing and you're not alone in feeling that way. You are on the right path with a wallet and exchange. Your goal should be to buy the desired amount of bitcoin on the exchange and then withdraw it to your wallet. Protecting your wallet is what makes you a bitcoin user and your own bank. Some people don't ever use their own wallet, they just use an exchange, and that is what I am warning against.
Buy bitcoin, withdraw to your wallet, and secure your private keys. What this security part means is up to you. For some people it means never letting private keys be on an online computer (you can actually send bitcoin while offline, delete your private key, and reconnect to the internet to send bitcoin), it means having encrypted backups of your private key or pass phrase in multiple places, it may even mean buying a "hardware wallet" which is a dedicated security device for holding bitcoin. This security part is the most important thing you need to understand about being your own bank.

What you might consider evolution, I would consider destruction. Destroying the unique properties of bitcoin so that it may adopt properties of centralized services for the convenience of a small and short sighted subsection of users is absurd. Bitcoin is the most decentralized network on the planet, from that decentralization flow all of its use cases. I will not sacrifice any measure of decentralization for anything, let alone call such a sacrifice "evolution".
If you want the benefits of centralized services, cheap and fast, use centralized services. Don't destroy the only decentralized network on the planet because you think blockchain is a cool word and want to use one. Also, BCH is centralized. 60% of miners are one party. It sucks compared to other centralized services, it lacks any kind of support services or loss restitution and is many times more expensive. It sucks compared to decentralized services. BCH is a solution with no problem. No matter what your needs are there are either better centralized services, or decentralized services available. It's also not "faster" than btc, they have the same block times.

Strong root password. A well configured iptables, though some people use ufw. Doing regular system maintenance and keeping packages upgraded and updated. It's a dev machine and I need remote access, so add proper use of keys and ssh related iptables settings. Same with the media server I expose and any development services I expose. Limiting those exposures to LAN or whitlisted addresses is much more secure than listening publicly. Never listening directly on protected ports and never running listening apps as root.
Since I use this machine for automated and aggressive torrenting to feed my media server I also use ClamAV. This is important for not only protecting my ubuntu machine but the devices I may serve those files to. If you're running multiple OS you'll also want to run rkhunter.

It doesn't even threaten them, they are just so stuck in the norms of their business and the average buyer and seller that they are ignoring that:
1. There is no lending necessary. It's effectively a cash transaction.
2. Inspections don't require escrow, just contractual commitment from buyer and seller to fulfill the transaction should inspections be completed without issue. If there are issues, let the seller handle them within a time frame.
3. Volatility doesn't matter, both parties are committing to the price at the moment they sign and commit to the good faith transaction post inspections. The buyer was likely already exposed to the volatility, and presumably the sellers only reason for doing this is to get exposure to the volatility.
I don't think it will ever be the norm to buy a house in full with either cash or bitcoin, but it happens. I hope someday I see a nice property in my neck of the woods listed like yours is. Don't listen to the haters, do your diligence, and good luck.

You are incorrect about additional validating nodes controlled by unique parties in disperse locations having no value.
The difference between a propaganda node and nodes controlled by disparate parties and locations is that the propoganda node exists solely as a conversation piece in creating a fake statistic to imply political support for a codebase change, and is not disparate in the parties controlling it or location it functions from. These last two points are what impact decentralization and is valuable for security.
That you seem unable to grasp this distinction despite litetally paragraphs of text elaborating on the security function of these nodes seems to indicate you are entirely closed to the idea that nodes impact consensus or as a result decentralized security. BIP148 as well as this very post are clear examples of that security mechanism in action. Denying that nodes perform this function inside this thread is absolutely absurd on its face.

It's suitable for many payment processing transactions, just typically not scenarios which require settlement in less than 10 minutes and small value transactions are only supported in settlement time frames as long as 24 hours, and even then not reliably.
Bitcoin is suitable for store of value, for speculation, for hedging and as a highly uncorrelated asset with high liquidity, for any transaction of value over a few dollars and any transaction settling in more than 10 minutes, for storing high value decentralized data and proofs, for recording decentralized proof of state, for programmable value transfer, as a protocol and platform for developing smart contracts and other solutions on top of including additional protocols, for proof of identity and proof of available funds, psuedo-anonymity, transaction transparency and financial management,  and for censorship resistance among many other functions. Most importantly, bitcoin is suitable for being your own bank and controlling your own wealth. It is a tool of liberty. Trying to make it fit all scenarios will destroy its unique properties.
BCH degrades the uses involving decentralization which is the majority of this list in favor of a temporary reduction in fees and viability of lower value transactions. As I said previously, if you do not value decentralization and do desire low value transactions why wouldn't you also desire settling in less than 10 minutes? BCH doesn't do that, but centralized services do. How about support and recovery services? Again available in centralized services. Fraud protection? Again, only centralized services. If these are your concerns you should not be using BCH or BTC.
It's also worth noting that BCH is centralized with over 60% of mining coming from one party, yet is severely disadvantaged to its centralized competitors due to lack of the above features. It also is severely disadvantaged against its decentralized competitors at decentralized jobs due to its centralization. It's simply not the best at anything. Why use it?

I'm glad you feel that way. I have some bitcoin gold I'm trying to sell, you want to buy?
All jokes aside the cost to enter the mining market, the thing you see as a detriment, is part of the cost required to attack the network. That it is high is a good thing. Can you even imagine botnets and viruses being used to attack bitcoin? It's also incredibly important that no party controls ASIC mining, and as these recent fork attempts have demonstrated mining is just part of the decentralized security mechanisms running bitcoin. Nodes are very highly decentralized and also clearly very active in their security role.
You're an armchair expert without a sufficient understanding of what decentralization is to accurately comment on it. If you like BCH so much go buy some. If you think GPU mining is equivalent to decentralization go buy Bitcoin Gold. Good luck.

Still think this is an incredibly stupid idea.  Every day is proof of keys day, making it one day a year and pretending it demonstrates the solvency of exchanges (and using it to promote Tracy Mayer's pet projects) does the community a disservice. Lying about its past performance such as claiming it resulted in Quadrigas collapse is just dishonest.
Education campaigns are generally good. Teaching people to withdraw their coins one day a year isn't a good education campaign. We should be having Proof of Reserves day and campaigning to get exchanges to adopt publicly auditable proof of reserves tools. We should be spending every day warning people to get off exchanges and teaching them how.
To that end here are some resources for learning how to secure your own keys for end users, and how to demonstrate proof of reserves for exchanges.

Not sure why it would bother you. Blockchains don't scale and the logic for a smaller blocksize is fairly sound. While it will likely never see a consensus, the discussion itself is valuable in that it keeps the subject where it should be - the ever expansive resource usage required by nodes. It's unsustainable. More than that, bringing these problems continually to the forefront of discussion will help keep at arms length larger blocks which would further exacerbate the problem. These are important technical discussions which would otherwise not be in the average Bitcoin users mind at all.

You're entirely ignoring the fact that the buyer (and apparently the seller) have already committed to holding through volatility. Whether price changes during escrow or after it doesn't matter to people like me, we were holding it as bitcoin anyways. OP is just getting that exposure through their house. All of your premises begin with the buyer holding dollars and having to buy bitcoin and the seller having to sell - but they don't.
You bring up some good points about legal rights of a buyer which I think should be waived in some manner forcing a commitment from both parties at the same time. But other than that I see the volatility you are so focused on as a non-issue.

It's not about Amazons quality as a host, it's about decentralization and misrepresentation. Nodes need to be dispersed to be decentralized. Spinning up 90% of the nodes on the network as a single party as a means of generating a snowball effect of perceived popular support for code changes is a manipulative and hostile attempt to influence the developmental direction in the hostile parties favor. It's an attack on bitcoin consensus. Thankfully we all have the capacity to observe the network, audit the code, and verify its integrity.
That's what our decentralized security model is about. We are resistant to these kinds of attacks because of people paying attention like this and a culture of involvement and awareness. A lot of the  newer "investors" don't really understand decentralization or what makes this protocol so unique. They must learn and become involved if they are to see the importance of, for example, discrediting the vast majority of network participants in an influential protocol change campaign as a single party operating in a single place.
I am both envious and terrified for these new users. I hope they can learn to value bitcoin not just for its price or perceived potential, but for the fundamental value of the worlds first and most decentralized network. We need to grow this culture if we ever hope to scale safely. Our users are our defense. As our numbers grow it is clear they are woefully unprepared for the role we need them to fill as defensive agents of the network.

I never accused you of inciting panic I accused you of treating the issue as more consequential than it is and assuring everyone that it will be okay, which is in my mind equally annoying as the people causing a panic because it's victim of the same flawed logic - you believe this issue is of significant and prolonged consequence just like those who would start a panic do and it is not. If you consider what may happen should either the block size be raised or not, you will find none of the potential consequences threaten the 4 billion dollar market cap of btc. Passionate people like Gavin and Mike will end up forking their own way if they cannot get the community to consensus, others will also. The kind of drama we are seeing here is par for the course in any open source community, people have different and often incompatible views of how to achieve similar goals. If we get a hard software fork and a new coin then so be it. If we can get most of the people on board with a proposal and change the limit then that will work too. If for some asinine reason every developer interested in cryptocurrency was so entrenched in disagreement that they all started their own forks and repos, Bitcoin would STILL be fine. It would still perform all the functions expected of it, it will still grow, and it will still have first movers advantage.
A great example is the node.js community. Filled with strife over stability of the platform versus experimentalism and corporate freedom it eventually broke up into node and io.js, where it stayed and grew distinct for years. The existence of each may have complicated things for developers looking to understand the difference, but it enriched and made competitive the ecosystem in unexpected ways. Now they are joining together again, and even if they didn't it would still be a huge win for the JavaScript community.
These arguments are good despite how disingenuous or misinforming many of them are. Disagreement is good. There is nothing wrong here. It sucks for people like Gavin who have  the choice of either becoming part time politician or running off to do his own thing, but that's open source software for you. You don't get into it without knowing that.

Bitcoin wipes out a huge percent of its value frequently. Many of us were here for the drop from $1100 to $160 and held through. I don't think even a 60% drop in value at any point is as severe as you claim. More than that, bitcoin moves fast and 24/7. Its one thing to know the market is going to crash at some point five years from now but timing it is going to be easier said than done. Just like the dips we just had, all will seem like the end of the world and induce panic only to bounce right back up. We will be seeing deep bear traps for a while and many people with your exact philosophy will fall into them thinking its time to lighten up.
There is more money to be made as a perfect gambler, but the gains of being a holder are enormous on their own and much more risk adverse. I'll be holding, 60% dips just mean its time to put a little more into the bitcoin retirement account and I don't have to time it, just take advantage of a presented price.

What do you think socialism is? What do you think free markets are?
Socialism is exactly what you have described. "A combination of free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and collective bargaining at the national level". "Free market" doesn't at all mean laissez faire hands off markets. There is no modern market which is truly "free", and socialist implemented markets typically have strong regulations protecting collective interests.
Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. Social ownership may refer to forms of public, collective or cooperative ownership, or to **citizen ownership of equity**.

Should be true. Blockchain is a mirage and is not where any interesting protocol properties come from. If you think it is anything other than a linked list style data store you are severely mistaken and need to learn how the valuable properties of immutability and security derive from the Nash equilibrium and game theory created by and scaling with protocol participants. Not understanding this is the only reason people buy altcoins or think private and permission blockchain are valuable at all.

You're projecting your own understanding of what being a bull means. I am a perma-bull for all intents and purposes. I sell all the time in the same way someone might spend from their savings. I also buy more all the time, in the same way someone might deposit to their savings. Being a perma bull doesn't mean "never sell unless absolutely necessary", and for engineers like Adam specifically I imagine it has absolutely nothing to do with price. It means Bitcoin has a grand future and permanent place in our society, that its technical underpinnings are purposefully resistant to change and unlikely to, and that it has current and future applied value greater than its dollar value.

The house in this instance is just cash for an OTC bitcoin trade. The agreement isn't to hold through volatility, there is no need for such an agreement. All of your expectations revolve around an escrow period that doesn't need to exist. Do the inspections up front, check the title yourself, then sign an agreement to send the bitcoin and sign over the house. The only period that any money is even in play is in the final moments at most days of the process, and there's nothing stopping either party from backing out before then because no commitment has been made by either party.
I again, don't think you're appreciating the abnormality of the context of this transaction. Most of your concerns seem misplaced be they about financing or USD values or laws covering escrow periods. Those are concerns for most people and purchases, but not in this context.

It was certainly positioning itself to be with its traditional banking VC and lobbying for things like at the time being discussed bitlicense. Everything they have done has been typical American enterprise behavior of shutting out and buying competitors while lobbying for the most favorable context - as in maintaining and growing market share while shutting out new entrants.


Not only more barriers than other exchanges abroad, but a leading name in attacking fungibility and blacklisting addresses even at the time. Most Coinbase users don't even use bitcoin. They store no keys they do not interact witht he protocol in any way shape or form. They are Coinbase users until they withdraw, not Bitcoin users. All they have is an IOU.


They have an obvious interest in bitcoin serving their business use cases, including subsidizing their network costs and making sure people do not use bitcoin directly, but through them custodially. That's what the NYA was all about for them - providing a stable user experience at low cost to businesses with no regard for the protocol or the participants they were pushing these costs on to. Makes perfect sense from the perspective of a self serving business, but it is a degradation of the protocol at the cost of the network participants for the businesses benefit.

I'm a software engineer. Decentralization was thought impossible as a system state before bitcoin. I believe that decentralization can be used as an anchor to build corruption resistant tool sets. Bitcoin needs to do everything possible to enhance its state of decentralization and fungibility, even if that means undesirable "currency" traits such as 10 minute confirmation delays and poor distribution. We can create the desirable currency traits on top of our decentralized state. As far as I am concerned decentralization as a network property might as well be the second coming of christ, it has the capacity to reshape the way we interact with the world.

People want low fees, no one needs to tell the the technical community that. Low fees are not a justification for harming the security or integrity of the network.
These developers do not work for you, they are volunteers. If you want something build it and see who else agrees. That's why bcash exists. If you don't agree with Bitcoins development or rational there are many alternatives willing to sacrifice network integrity for end user convenience.

The "best" way depends on your priorities and location. If your priority is a new friendly experience in the US, Gemini and cashapp do an okay job. If your priority is no KYC and no counterparts risk p2p services like bisq are the best. If your goal is just trading high volume low fee derivatives are possibly an option, like bitmex.  Other options in the US if fees are your concern include bitstamp, kraken, and bitfinex.

I guess we'll see, right now all these things are simply allegations from a self claimed whistleblower who was fired. Kraken hasn't offered any alternative version of events yet and nothing has been tested in court.

This subreddit is the face of the community. Walking into it is like walking into a bar. There is uproarious laughter, the clinking of drinks, and at times some very interesting discussion. To walk into that bar and say "Hey there is way too much fun happening here! We need to get rid of the obnoxious behaviour and the noise so that I can get what I want out of this place and learn a little bit about wine tasting! Also it looks just terrible for new comers who want to learn about alcohol!" makes you kind of up your own ass. There are many great places for learning about bitcoin, for getting bitcoin news. You don't need to change this bar as per your whims to get it.
Thinking that your vision of a better r/bitcoin is anyone elses vision of a better r/bitcoin, or that it's even necessary, is so full of yourself and self absorbed that of course you are going to be called selfish for it. We're all just going to keep drinking and laughing at you, and if you're lucky point you to the wine tasting bar down the street. Go to the mailing list, read the bitcoin stack, visit the IRC. Don't make anyone else change for you.

I'm not really sure what you mean when you say there are no API's for bitcoin. So many services have built custom bitcoin API's on top of services like Core, bcoin, and btcd all of which expose their own API's. Entire protocols with their own API's like lightning have grown on top of the community, as well countless projects like BTCPay and block explorers all exposing API's for Bitcoin services.
What kind of interface are you looking for or feel isn't being made?

Are you saying it wasn't? Not only had Quadriga themselves acknowledged the CIBC/billerfy issues and the public ether loss by October, but members of the community like myself have spent every opportunity to dissuade people from entering Quadriga for a year now. If that doesn't qualify as public knowledge I don't know what does. How could anybody miss the endless stream of complaints that withdrawals weren't being processed or the explicit acknowledgments by Quadriga that they were having withdrawal issues and inaccessible millions of dollars?

As always I feel obligated to comment I think this event is not only pointless, but harmful. This does not prove solvency of exchanges, it gives people a false sense of confidence in their exchanges. Instead of a culture of security theater once a year we need to ALWAYS be keeping our coins off exchanges. Use leverage to reduce your counterpart risks and hedge traders. Do not leave the majority of your coins sitting on exchange and do not delude yourself into thinking this event equates to "proof of keys" . It does not.

An excellent rebuke of the criticisms, but seeing as how this is a bitcoin community and not a realtor community I think I'll stay. If you don't want to respond to criticism then don't. No one is making you reply with immature defensive comments.

You have the maturity of a teenager. Allow me to jog your memory of the many times you've suggested that OP needs to do things through a realtor and appealed to your authority as a realtor.




Okay, so you're a brilliant realtor and you've declared doing things OP way (or any other the other people who have successfully sold homes for Bitcoin since 2013 when the first one was) are stupid.


What is the safe way according to you if not through a realtor and via the totally inapplicable methodology you describe used in 99% of instances? As it's all you've talked about I don't know what other conclusions you expect people to draw.
You have spent a dozen comments all over this thread pontificating about your expertise and the risks that apply to completely different situations than OPs and ignored being repeatedly called out on it except to lash out.

It's a great deal for the buyer. It's been acknowledged the price is below market, and the seller is clearly open to accommodating any needs the buyer has. We have a culture here of research, education, and diligence. There's nothing blind about it.


You know what they say about assumptions. You've made a lot of those in your many posts in this thread, and when it's noted very few of them are relevant you just jump to another thing equally presumptuous.

Sorry I missed your reply and heavily edited my previous comment to better address yours while I was doing some other things.
I do believe you're correct that the typical strategy in these cases is to force a settlement and many claims are plausibly false, or half truths, and may never be explored further. Maybe it's all false and this is a guy with money and a vendetta.
I don't really have any basis with which to judge the face value of many of these accusations. I only know if they were true I would find that reason to avoid Kraken. I don't see any reason anyone would be able to make a determination of the face value of these claims based on a one sided accusatory document. There's just no information at all outside the explicit facts someone is making these claims and taking them to court claiming to be a whistle blower.

This has nothing to do with proof of keys and it is amazing how people continue to support such a stupid event. Less than 10% of deposits pulling out and then going back in the next day is not a run on a bank and does not expose fractional reserves. It gives people a false sense of security and they are outright lying about the claims of exchanges that have been allegedly impacted by proof of keys in the past.
Stop supporting stupid things that can't possibly have the effects they claim, reduce counterparty risk EVERY DAY.

Honestly I think that's just a lack of confidence talking because it isn't nearly as complicated as you make out.


Then set your timelock for longer than 2 weeks. Or close your channels.


Pretty much every bitcoin service and business requires a hot wallet. If it was impractical to secure one we'd have a lot more problems than lightning.


 Watchtower don't selectively not do their jobs, and you can use as many as you want including your own. Going on vacation doesn't need to equate to every piece of hardware in the world going offline either. Throw up a watchtower on AWS if it concerns you. No trust involved. It's also worth noting if you only send never receive or your side of the channel is empty you have zero risk of theft and can leave your channels offline all you want.


Backing up two files instead of one isn't really that much more complicated. Both require configuration and decisions about how and where you choose to trust. Whether or not to be custodial, special care and attention when your keys are hot, how to store backups.  Any decision made poorly can result in losing all your coins.


It's a client side restriction that can be turned off and only exists as a safety feature because lightning is still so nascent. That's where the real risk is and the only thing you don't seem worried about - lightning bugs.


It's a batching mechanism. Pay one fee, get as many transactions as you want out of that bitcoin value. That you have to then pay a new fee to get another set of N transactions instead of paying an onchain fee for every transaction is a great feature.


It's a series of trade offs. Hot wallet and 2 backups in exchange for unlimited scaling private free instant transactions. While not suitable for every use case, it's suitable for many and those benefits are more than competitive with both Onchain bitcoin and all these scam alts. It's instant, POW secured, scales, private, and essentially free. If it's not competitive it is because it blows the competition out of the water.

I honestly hope they get hacked to teach this new generation of users what mtgox was like. Only then will we see people using bitcoin instead of using Coinbase and I would happily sit through another 2 year bear market to watch it happen.

Did you read the bolded text describing what social ownership means in the context?
Bitcoin is absolutely an embodiment of libertarian ideology. That doesn't change the fact that decentralized properties could significantly increase accountability in all forms of governance, just especially left leaning ones which concentrate power so significantly. Bitcoin is programmable money. Can you imagine a state using Bitcoin as it's currency, whose taxes are collected in Bitcoin or a higher layer side chain and whose spending is entirely transparent? Can you further imagine when typical abuse of power takes root having the social ability to revoke all monetary access from the acting government and trigger an election monitorable and executed on a side chain resolving to Bitcoin? Blockchain is Bitcoin is decentralization, and it has the potential to change governance as we know it for all models.

He claims to have been fired for informing people of things like doing business with entities on the OFAC list. He pretty explicitly details the people (Ng) he claims to have alerted and their resulting inaction.
Again, these are all untested claims, and based on the content of the suit I'd say the plaintiff has a very good understanding of the Kraken business and even notes several people who don't (employee 1).
The plaintiff alleges to have signed a lease enabling Kraken to use his address as the recorded address of Kraken for their servicing financial partners. He was employed as a financial analyst not an executive. It's not really appropriate at all IMO.
I agree with you that these are not facts, but accusations - but I don't think you've even read the claims based on some of your criticisms of them.

In order for your argument to be accurate it would imply all of Bitcoins value is additive to the preexisting economy, none of it supplants it. Why do you think that is the null hypothesis when people  have to take fiat and purchase bitcoin to get exposure?

Calling it blackmail implies an impressively controlling attitude on the part of the blackmailed and I would hope the child is quite a bit younger than 14 if that is the case.

This is not how proof of keys functions because only the smallest fraction of users are active social media users and will engage in it, as well it doesn't move corporate keys. There can be zero expectation that this event will ever do what it claims, meaning the only result is people with a false sense of security thinking their exchange is safe to hold on.
That site's "failures" are entirely people blocked for AML reasons. Not the results of runs on any exchange. Some of the failures, like quadriga, had NOTHING to do with proof of keys.  It's all lies and marketing.

I hate these discussions. It always ends up with laymen at the throats of engineers who won't give them what they want for reasons they cannot appreciate.
Reddit is the worst place for these discussions. It's not where the developers are. Serious discussions about consensus changes are best started in the mailinglist, git, or IRC meetings. Developers don't define consensus, but it is the best place to iron out engineering challenges and debate the technical merit of ideas before presenting them in the form of BIPS to the public. Nothing productive is accomplished by having this discussion on reddit, it's just going to lead to thousands of opinionated posts by people who have never run a node let alone touched the source.
I also think these discussions are prompted by the one thing most irrelevant to raising a blocksize - fees. Fees are a defensive mechanism of the network. The blocksize cap and the fees act to reduce the impact of resource consuming attacks by making them expensive. This makes fee events an inevitability, a desirable one compared to the alternative where nodes shoulder an unlimited amount of spam. Even outside of attacks Bitcoin will have fees. It's either that or start attacking our own underlying decentralization which none of us are willing to do. I will never, ever support a blocksize increase because a user expects bitcoin to be free or cheap to transact. That is a misguided expectation. 
As for the actual suggestion of raising block sizes I think it is wholly unnecessary. Blocks keep clearing and fees keep going back down. My mempool was entirely clear just a few hours ago. I'd sooner support smaller blocks than I would big blocks. The blockchain is literally an append only data structure. It currently consumes ~250 GB. My full node is using ~2 TB of bandwidth monthly. Raising the blocksize without a solution in place to address the consequences in propagation time and the additional node running cost is a failing solution. We can't run spv wallets without full nodes to serve them, and spv wallets aren't secure. The idea everyone should run a wallet on their phone without a full node is a terrible network architecture goal.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:09:31
Judge an idea not a person. Tonal bitcoin is a ridiculous idea. A blocksize decrease is not. It is sound engineering based on basic, inescapable facts.
Yes, you are at fault for urging people as you put it to do anything. Where is your BIP? Refer us to some engineering discussion. Show us some code. What makes you so sure of yourself that you think jumping from zero to consensus debate is appropriate?

By using lightning on Bitcoin you are saying you want to trust Bitcoins security model for your transactions. Force closing a channel is the act of resolving to that security model and as an onchain action requires an onchain fee. This is what makes lightning trustless, and while it doesn't mean you need to pay the onchain fee for every transaction it does mean you have to reserve fess and potentially pay it for closing channels to protect yourself from fraud or any other reason you might have to close a channel. It's meant to be an uncommon event and the cheap price to pay for unlimited near free trustless transactions secured by Bitcoin.

Wikileaks absolutely has published content on American crimes. There was the releases relevant to [Abu Ghraib]( and the [covered up killings of journalists]( to name just two off the top of my head. Wikileaks has done Americans and many other nationalities an enormous public service in illuminating the actions of their government and introducing transparency.
Lets have another real world example.
"Stolen" documents are published describing the governments crimes in China regarding the "reeducating" of Muslims. Very real human rights violations, just like the very real human rights violations funded or executed by the US government globally. Publishing or possessing these documents is a crime in China.
If an American anywhere in the world was publishing this content, do you think Americans would support extradition, or an extradition treaty generally with China? Of course not.
America and China use the exact same playbook when dealing with the human rights violations they are responsible for including the barring of international investigators and prosecutors as just recently happened with the ICC prosecutors investigating American human rights violations in Afghanistan. Every action is comparable in how China and America deal with these situations, yet in each jurisdiction each party vilifies the other and claims no wrong doing themselves. To not acknowledge this is to ignore obvious public evidence in favor of blind patriotic dogma.
Thinking Assange did what he did self servingly is to equally ignore the obvious costs his actions have had. 7 years confinement. Even prison have yard time. He'd only even get 5 years max in the US. These are the thoughts of an unthinking, dogmatic patriot. Not someone surveying the evidence to reach a conclusion.

No they aren't. No wallet has as poor an SPV infrastructure as SPV electrum, and as a result it has been the target of ceaseless attacks.
Most SPV wallets use a trusted third party instead of a random trusted third party like electrum. That's the key attack vector which leads to everything I just described - the privacy leaking, the benefit of DDoSing honest electrum servers and spooling up as many of your own as possible to increase odds of victims connecting, and the broken error system vulnerable to injection didn't help either.

You're ignoring real evidence, I'm not sure why. That real evidence is the people like me, many of them in this sub and all of them represented by the fiat to bitcoin trade volume which can be objectively observed, storing their money outside a bank. I'm not sure if you're aware but investment accounts are the leading profit generators for banks and money sitting in Bitcoin isn't sitting in those accounts. The evidence you are ignoring is all the fiat that could otherwise be in interest yielding accounts and profit generating investments is in Bitcoin and that costs the banks something.

The default configuration is dangerous and opens up attack vectors. It's a poor design. If other nodes get DDoS'd it doesn't impact users the same way as electrum because they aren't picking random people to trust. If you are looking for an SPV wallet with full node integration and much more reasonable default configurations try BRD or Green.
I asked you by what metric electrum was the best, you've yet to provide any metric.
Please do not let your ignorance about the safety of electrum endanger other users. If the constant stickies warning of attacks, the talks at seemingly every conference, and the warnings from every capable developer in the space aren't enough to deter you that's fine. But don't sit here proclaiming electrum is perfectly safe and a well designed, trustless infrastructure. The best, even. It flies in the face of facts.

If you have bitcoin it costs a fee to spend it, always. You are only shown that fee when you attempt to spend it. You seem fine with this.
If you have bitcoin in a lightning channel, which is just a fancy bitcoin address, it costs a fee to send that bitcoin onchain, always. Lightning services show that fee upfront as a commit fee and most UI's remove that estimated fee from the balance.
The issue you are complaining about is functionally no different than having a bitcoin wallet that subtracts the current estimated fee from your balance numbers. I can understand why it appears alarming, but it's not. It's also not a case of not being your money any longer.

I disagree.  Miners acting in a manner aligned with their incentives are exactly what keeps the protocol resistant to change and accomplishes the gatekeeping you speak of.

If you have some idea that creates a decentralized network on strictly cryptographic properties I'd be interested to hear it. And I'm not arguing economics, I'm arguing game theory. The reason we have bitcoin persisting on the economic security model it does is because up until this point in time it's thought to be impossible to create a decentralized network on purely cryptographic properties. If you've broken this barrier you will be heralded indeed.
If you think bitcoin right now persists on a cryptographic security model you have a grave misunderstanding about the mechanisms of bitcoin.

Think that entire thought through. You're the president of the galactic empire. Your state acts as a central currency authority, dictating the worth of currencies your state issue. Someone breaks into your stock and currency exchange and changes the listed price of your galactic currency to $0. What happens?
Well, surely people begin by trying to buy some free galactic currency. Its cost is 0 after all. Investing in something that unexpectedly has no value seems an obvious and risk free venture. Those people have to buy their free currency from somewhere and they do so from the exchange that sets the price, the one that's hacked.
So you're the president, people are trying to buy - from you - a bunch of currency that you print and you've listed as free. What do you do? Is the answer kill yourself? Is the answer dive for the pants of the first person you see? No. The answer is the same as anytime the price of something is listed incorrectly. The price is corrected and any goods that were successfully sold at the incorrect price are either honored or withheld.
The idea of "well what do you pay the person that is going to fix the problem with?" has absolutely nothing to do with the solution to the problem, payment means need not ever change.

I have explained what happens and I will explain it again. As I said the attack vector only exists because electrum connects to a random node on a list. If you DDoS a different service you can only stop that one node from functioning - on one else is attacked. A single node is denied service. With elctrum you can DDoS every node on the list that isn't yours and put up many of your own, so you aren't denying service to electrum users you're providing the service. As the service provider you are trusted, you gain details about users addresses and they trust your outputs. We have seen cases where attackers will do things like send error messages to connecting peers telling them electrum is out of date and to upgrade to a virus version stealing their coins. None of these things are possible by DDoSing any other service because it isn't enabling those random trusted connections from a pool, and many aren't privacy leaking at all.
It cannot happen to any wallets. A DDoS can happen to any service, but the kind of attacks on users I describe are only possible through electrums random trusting setup. A DDoS otherwise only denies an attacked node service, not attacks an entire population of wallet users and attempts to steal their coins.
You have no idea you are the victim of attack unless as an electrum user unless you receive and identify one of these embedded viruses. While awareness may protect you in some minor days it's only even necessary because of the absurdly bad design of electrum. No amount of awareness stops you from leaking addresses and actions. Other wallets do not have these faults.
If you want to claim electrum is the best, let alone safe, refute any of these details.

What an unnecessarily long winded history and unsupported conclusion. There is a reason bitgold didn't take off and it's because its fault tolerance and decentralized security properties were derived from voting mechanics. When satoshi proposed a nash equilibrium instead it was a move to a significantly more robust decentralized security model.
Trying to use Sazbo's premise for the failed bitgold experiment as an argument for a node driven bitcoin fork is flawed from the outset. The only argument in favor of such a fork would be defensively and in the context of an ongoing attack, as has always been the original intent of such a mechanism.

You are correct, which is why the measure of our security is the cost attacking us would represent to such an attacker over a given period of time. That cost is significantly amplified by our most desperate of defensive options such as a node driven fork or PoW change, the use of which should be looked at similarly to amputation. It is cutting off the very necessary appendages for the sake of the whole of the body - an enormous sacrifice not to be taken lightly.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:56:41
Through the coinbase reward/fees and the length of the blockchain. The coinbase reward/fees create an economic incentive to compete to find the next block via PoW. Attempting to attack the network is to threaten that incentive, as blocks which do not conform to protocol specs or which attempt to double spend coins risk being rejected as not part of the longest chain over a given function of time. This creates our 51% attack barrier, which is an economic measure of the security of the network. I.E. how much would it cost to possess 51% of the network for a given period of time?  If you want to double spend coins that are already in a block and confirmed you need to outpace the mining activity on the chain to create the longest one.
These barriers to attack coupled with a reward system that pays would-be attackers for honestly applying their resources in a provable way creates the Nash equilibrium which incentives honest behaviour while creating both a real and opportunity cost to actual attackers. They must maintain the longest chain of a coin they have entirely devalued through their attack and thus receive little reward beyond disrupting the system. You might be saying to yourself "Ah, but they can short bitcoin and thus increase their reward for attacking!" and this is true, but it also raises the economic cost as now you have to gamble as well as attack the network, and everyone buying the shorters bitcoins has equal financial incentive to support the system as does the shorter have to attack it. It takes an overwhelming economic force to successfully attack bitcoin in this way, and that force would be more profitably applied to simply supporting bitcoin. That's the Nash equilibrium. The competing parties of miners would see no benefit to "changing strategies" to do anything other than competitively mine bitcoin.
For all the blustering of miners threatening this and that, do any of them actually mine blocks that break the protocol rules? No. They are all businesses with economic incentives to behave a certain way. Once someone actually decides to attack the network through a hostile mining behaviour those parties will be quick to learn there's a reason it isn't done. It's going to be expensive.
Bitcoin achieves its decentralized properties through a financial security model and that's what makes it so unique, and certainly a far more defensible system than node voting. To reduce a security model to voting is to reduce it to politics. How can anyone make an honest argument that a political security model is more decentralized or resistant to attack than the Nash equilibrium currently securing bitcoin?

You chose to enter the channel knowing it would need to be closed. You choose when it is closed. Stop.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:36:51
It's a safety issue. You could design transactions that are time consuming to verify, pushing enough transactions to effectively take nodes offline by keeping them busy verifying for example. This and other potential attack vectors are avoided by not propagating non-standard transactions. Non-standard transactions are still allowed, just not propagated until they are in a block since blocks are of limited size and this results in practical limits on the resource consumption of verifying a block. If you want them mined you need to either mine them yourself or approach a miner.

First, you're misusing the word private. If it's DDoS'd it's public. You can't DDoS something not publicly listening.
No amount of awareness stops the privacy leaks, except being aware electrum leaks addresses and actions and using a different wallet.
If a node serving SPV users from a trusted party SPV wallet like mycelium or coinbase or blockstream is DDoS'd the service goes down unless those teams mitigate the attack. that is the full impact - denial of service. They don't have the attack vector of their users connecting to the attackers nodes if theirs get DDoS'd.
If you haven't understood any of these four explanations I'm not sure you're going to. If you want to hear Peter Todd and John Newberry talk about the unsafe infrastructure of electrum I've dug up a clip from the recent [unconfiscatable conference]( for you on light clients in general, including electrum. They note electrum could have gone with trusted auditable third parties and been a much better infrastructure. The entire talk is worth listening to if you have an hour.
A trusted third party is a better alternative than a trusted third party that you don't know. It's that simple.

The Nash Equilibrium doesn't protect PoW from attempts to reduce its cost or proof and it doesn't need to. What it does is aligns incentives such that hashing power is always more profitably applied by mining bitcoin than it is attacking bitcoin. This equilibrium is what has forced all those trying to change the protocol to continue mining a version of bitcoin they don't necessarily support, it's what protects the protocol from errant change. That block withholding or even asic boost exist does not fundamentally change those incentives such that people stop mining and start attacking bitcoin.
That is the value of our decentralized security model. If there ever comes a point when the equilibrium fails and we find ourselves being attacked by a majority of miners we have defensive options to restore the equilibrium such as a node driven fork.
The idea of a voting mechanic in place of this equilibrium would ruin the existing security model more than any proposal for larger blocks could.

Transactions are different sizes depending on lots of factors. There is no strict answer to how many transactions can one block hold. One factor is the number of outputs being combined. Another is the kind of transaction. Is it a multisignature transaction? A pay to script hash segwit address? A bech32?
The minimum transaction size [discussed here]( is theoretically something like 66 bytes, but we'll use the slightly more practical [195 bytes pay to witness public key hash transaction](
Segwit is a changing of the weighting of parts of the transaction, specifically the witness parts. A non-witness byte has a weight of 4 bytes, while a witness byte has a weight of 1 byte. The protocol enables blocks with up to 4 MB of weight. That could be 1 MB of non-witness data, which would be multiplied by 4 to fill the 4 MB segwit weight. It could also be a segwit transaction like our 195 byte example of which the witness data is 110 bytes. 85 * 4 + 110 is 450 virtual bytes for our transaction. Blocks can hold 4MB virtual weight, so 4MB/450 bytes is 8889 transactions per block for an answer to your original question. That's 
about 14.8 transactions per second.
Another confounding factor is that a growing amount of transactions are being batched, making it difficult to say exactly how many transactions can fit in a block. The technical capacity from a set of fee and space optimizing participants is likely higher than this 14.8 tps estimate and will only grow as more space optimizations like schnorr become the norm.

Countries love to create grounds for violating other countries sovereignty and foreign individuals rights. It doesn't make the application of those laws ethical or moral. Frequently countries throw a fit if their sovereignty is violated retaliating to alleged terrorists and it leads to terrifying escalations like we have seen between India and Pakistan recently.
Can you even imagine if these same kinds of laws were used against the US? The US takes for granted they can impose things like financial laws around the world, but someday the shoe will be on the other foot and all of these justifications will be thrown out the window as Americans cry that their sovereignty or individual right are being violated.
If a less powerful country was trying to do the same thing the US is doing to a US citizen, like say a US reporter was documenting the war crimes that occurred in Myanmar, Myanmar would be laughed at for trying to arrest the publisher of 'illegal state secrets'.

You don't seem to understand the mechanism at play. The reason the DDoS is effective is because of the way electrum by default connects to **random public** servers. If you can stop honest nodes in the electrum server list from taking connections it increases the odds default electrum users will connect to the attackers nodes where they leak privacy and have previously been served malicious content - including embeded viruses designed to steal coins. The fact that such malicious content can be served at all, that privacy leaking occurs at all, and that trust is being given to random parties are the failings of electrum as an SPV wallet.
Any server running any software can be DDoS'd but since no one is randomly connecting to and trusting the un-DDoS'd nodes the attack vector doesn't exist.
I understand being defensive is human nature. I'd ask you to stop. It's one thing to be wrong. It's another thing to be wrong in a way that could lead to other people being hurt.

That you have misinterpreted my description of mining to become "everyone trusts the miners" means you really have no idea what I am talking about. The equilibrium I describe is reliant on the miners trusting no one, not each other not users. Users shouldn't trust miners either. Trust doesn't enter the equation. The only thing users need to trust is that the incentive structure is in place and their defensive options in the worst case scenario are whole, and really calling that trust and not observation is a misnomer. Nothing is to be taken on faith by design.
Now compare that with a political system or campaign. If you're a user with a vote and big/small blockers are campaigning for your vote. You are trusting that 1) you can come to an informed conclusion before casting your vote. 2) The larger population is capable of making an informed conclusion. 3) Voters are not easily manipulated or lied to.
So you can trust that those political constant will remain true and protect the integrity of the voting system or would you rather the existing trustless incentive model continues to do its job? Personally I'm for trustless properties so I'm thus against political mechanisms and pro economic security models.

The future of Bitcoin is an all or nothing value proposition IMO. It either is a revolution in trust or it isn't. It is either a secure and uniquely valuable security model or it isn't. Decentralization either has value or it doesn't.

The rich will use it to do more of what they have always been doing - enriching themselves - and without the risk of government intervention at that.

Any market for any asset can change after you bought it. Some people make money and some people lose money on that change, that's how it works.

As I already explained to you bitcoin is fungible. If a black market currency trader chooses to sell USD for bitcoin (as already happens all the time in places like Venezuela), before the bitcoin is offloaded somewhere else legal. This kind of arbitrage is very profitable and happens all the time, and doesn't allow the Venezuelan government to know either traders identity.

You should use paypal if consumer protections are your major concern. If you want to be protected while using bitcoin you generally have to protect yourself. This can be accomplished through escrow for online purchases for example but it is not an inherent property of the network.
Bitcoin is currently best used for transferring value for cheap, storing wealth, speculating, proof of existence, settlement, commerce, self banking, and multi-signature financial arrangements among many other things.  In terms of internet commerce bitcoin does favor sellers compared to traditional payment solutions, but no more than cash. Cryptographic cash is preferable for many forms of financial interaction, including other forms of consumer protection. We're talking about the unprecedented protection from seizure or third party interference, the ability to be your own low fee bank, or the ability to cross borders with limitless value stored as a dozen words in your memory, and the protection of pseudo-anonymity.
The kind of consumer protections you and many others want will arrive as financial institutions begin accepting bitcoin backed accounts, and those protections will use the same infrastructure as traditional payment solutions to facilitate the desired consumer oversight while losing all of the unique protections of bitcoin.
TL;DR: Keep using paypal, at some point you'll be able to fund your paypal with bitcoin. You'll never get the kind of consumer protections you want directly from the bitcoin protocol, that's just not the job it does. It's not backwards to have a different set of priorities than traditional payment providers; that's a healthy, diverse marketplace.

The dollar value spent mining literally creates a dollar value barrier to attack the network. The more expensive it is, the more secure and thus more functional its unique security model is. I see value in the expenditure of resources to generate those bitcoins. I see attempts or desire to reduce that expenditure as entirely missing the point of Bitcoin, that expenditure is what makes it useful in some situations compared to traditional solutions.
The chain of events you just describes is a panic crash, and we live them all the time. The part you are forgetting is where the floor is. You meet ideologues who won't sell at all, you meet opportunists who see an undervalued asset, you meet speculators willing to gamble on the chance of wild returns. When you do meet these people, the exact same pattern you describe happens in reverse and meets a ceiling of delusion. It's the market cycle. There can be neither a death spiral or an infinite price rising so long as greed and fear exist and the security mechanisms have any value at all.

First of all, bitcon can emulate instant value transfer the same way everyone else does - by anticipating a future value transfer and providing services immediately expecting that value transfer to eventually complete. We call it 0-conf.
Second, if you want to walk around with paper wallets split into 5 dollar denominations and emulate the function of cash, go right ahead. No one is stopping you.
But finally, if your goal is to remove the confirmation process on bitcoin you are simply being naive. Confirmations are a necessary part of nakamoto consensus, without which we wouldn't have decentralisation. Don't advocate to break one of the most innovative technologies in the world because of percieved inconvenience. It's not that the inconvenience isn't real, it's simply that of course it's going to be inconvenient using a screw driver when what you need is a hammer - using 6-conf bitcoin transactions is inappropriate for the use case you are describing. You use the wrong tool for the job and you are going to have a bad time.

What you are doing is gambling. There is a reason why we post suicide hotlines here sometimes, these markets are unpredictable and volatile and they ruin lives.

Spending and commerce is far from bitcoins only use case. If everyone held all coins and spent none supply would shrink but demand for many use cases such as speculation, store of value, and settlement layer would persist, necessitating a rise in price. Commerce is not the be all end all of bitcoin, and in fact creates more downwards price pressure than upwards. Companies have to pay the cost of doing business, and at some point down the supply chain line virtually all spent bitcoins are sold for fiat.

There is no definition, no context in which you can accurately say Bitcoin inflated nearly 100% last month. Go ahead and cite examples using supply of bitcoin or ANY currency pair between the dates of February 1 and March 1 to demonstrate how Bitcoin inflated 100%. Even the maximum price drop in that period - which is NOT an accurate measure of inflation of an asset - was only $10260 to $6000 or a 41.5% drop. The reality is Bitcoin entered the month at $10260 USD, no 7 day average price dropped below 8.8k USD, and I don't have any means immediately available to tell you what the month long average price was but I'm willing to bet it was pretty close to 10k USD.

People complaining about power usage in Bitcoin fundamentally misunderstand bitcoins value and security model, which are directly associated to its power usage. The more power used, the higher the cost to attack, the more secure the network. To try to reduce the power usage is to try to reduce bitcoins security.
More than that, to complain about the electricity usage is to ignore where that electricity comes from - including many green energy sources and subsidizing otherwise geographically or economically stranded power.
It is to further ignore the energy usage of the institutions bitcoin supplants. Bitcoin consumes less than most industries, including banking.
Overall the first thing I think when someone says bitcoins energy usage is a problem is "that person hasn't given this issue any significant thought and has no idea how bitcoin works"

You couldn't be more wrong. If you think it is as simple as you say you should try it for a few years.
The truth is freelance and entrepreneural programming is a very tough gig with a high failure rate. When anyone and everyone can do a task the competition becomes intense and the pay drops. The more sophisticated tasks require significant study and experience. Building software is like building a house you can copy and paste. Building a good house often requires multiple experts in multiple disciplines and excellent planning and design, it's not a trivial task. Then you still have to sell the thing, even if you can copy and paste it when you're done. As well, everyone has their own idea of what they want the house to look like or do, so even with copy and pasted homes you are constantly adding a bathroom to the garage or some other such nonsense extension no one else will want or use.
If it was a matter of write 300 lines of code and call it a day I would have retired a decade ago.

So if I can sum up: your assertion (and that of this post) is the distinction between bakkt and other services available like coinbase is so significant as to be a great boon for bitcoin? That the lack of these services inhibits growth?
I cannot see any evidence of that that you have presented or otherwise.
My assertion is that these services are not at all distinct, and any features derived from bakkt can be found elsewhere. Further I assert there is no evidence of this unseen demand for bakkt which is unsuitable for any other service. I believe the evidence supporting is substantial and exists in the many examples of existing services providing comparable features and regulatory scrutiny.

It depends how much bitcoin you're securing and how you're securing,  as well as what resources you have available to use risky clients. I recently claimed a half dozen alts which it took me several days of syncing because there were no light weight clients. I ended up paying about $100 for AWS servers and spending about 8 hours total going through my security process to move and resecure my coins, debugging shitcoin client issues, and dealing with exchanges. 
Not a minor task and one which if done carelessly carries a lot of risk, but when done carefully carries low risk and at least in my case increased my holdings several percent.

I wonder how much of this talent issue is a conflict with typical corporate values and the values of the individuals most likely to devote years of experience to Bitcoin as a FOSS project.
Lets face it - people involved with Bitcoin for a good deal of time probably own some and have become financially independent over the years. They don't need to let money dictate their actions, they can pursue their passions.
Between financial independence of the people with this talent set, very high demand, and a potentially different set of values and vision for Bitcoin between corporate versus FOSS goals it seems very reasonable that there should be a lack of corporate talent. It may even be a good thing. The talent is picking and choosing and that's how it should be.

Your concerns are of a very narrow view and very overblown in terms of consequence. More than that, people STILL do things that are illegal all the time as the North American war on drugs makes evident. Something being illegal doesn't stop it, especially when it is peer to peer. You know that the illegal offshore holdings of US companies alone is more than the bitcoin market cap by trillions?

It's the other way around I think you mistyped, the attack cost is lower with PoS than it is PoW.
Example: The cost to attack a PoS coin is a percent of its supply. Not only is the premine itself enough to attack the coin, but anyone could have purchased enough to attack the coin at lower prices. You have no assurances of distribution at any point in the PoS coins lifecycle. The ethereum foundation or anyone else for that matter could have bought the necessary percent in the ICO and have already invalidated the security model.
More than that, these cryptocurrencies are volatile. Where Ethereum can drop 50% in price and be thus 50% less secure *not only in that given moment, but in all future moments since the attacker can hold their coins*, PoW coins cost to attack does not fluctuate with price and is momentary, not continuous. The cost to attack a PoW coin exists at a given dollar value in a given moment, being able to attack a PoW coin one second isn't an assurance you will be able to attack it in another second - where a PoS coin does offer that assurance.
It will always cost less to attack a PoS coin than a PoW coin because the barrier to attack is lower and there are fewer defensive options. It costs less to have secured 20% of all Eth at some point in time than it costs to secure 50%+ mining power in perpetuity. If a PoW coin is attacked they can change PoW algorithms, they can blacklist blocks, they can use nodes to ensure protocol validation. If a PoS coin is attacked it has none of these defensive options.
2) Zero knowledge proofs are a wonderful thing, but it takes a special kind of ignorance to think ethereum is on the forefront of that technology either. Sharding is an absolute contradiction to blockchain technology, just another example of the way Ethereum chooses to not be an immutable decentralized ledger. It's a fact that the leading technology in this space is developed for bitcoin as evidence by the over 90% of altcoin repos downstream from it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:46:36
Of course any transaction that is payed for is legitimate, but there is no valid use case other than attacking the blockchain for this transaction structure, thus it is an attack. There is no reason to believe all of these inputs are colored coins which would be the only viable explanation for sending a transaction with a fee several orders of magnitude larger than the sum being transacted.
So yes, we agree it costs them money, we agree (I hope) that these transactions have no viable use case, and we agree that these transactions bloat the blockchain. That leaves the only thing to disagree about calling it spam or not. I say call it whatever you want, so long as it's clear it is a hostile act with hostile intent.
The fact that Bitcoin can deal with a denial of service style attack, consuming available resources by flooding the services with seemingly legitimate traffic, by simply raising the cost to transact instead of actually denying service is brilliant. We've found a way to make DDoS style attacks pay for the infrastructure of the network and bankrupt themselves in the process. That is the conversation we should be having - not "was it spam?"

I'm having some confusion with lnd and was hoping someone could provide some insight. I seem to be missing some sats, or at the least failing to account for some outputs. Counting all my paid invoices (lncli listinvoices) as inputs and my on chain tx fees (lncli listchaintxns) and outgoing transactions (lncli listpayments) as outputs to my initial funding balance, I seem to be missing 7859 sats. I know they were there a couple hours ago and no transactions have occurred since, they just seem to be gone now. Local channel balances went from 107,466 to 99,606 overnight with no transactions to speak of occurring.
Edit: It has been suggested to me the fields I am not accounting for are the reserved transaction fees for new channels. This so far seems like the most likely culprit. Is this the commit_fee produced by listchannels?

I strongly disagree with the narrative that the technical community isn't good at communicating and that this is the problem. The communication is public and in plain English. 
The primary issue IMO is that a leaderless and decentralized community has no unified or coherent messaging or marketing. Unified messaging and marketing from singular sources is what people are used to using to form their opinions. The idea of readin an IRC meetings notes to get a possibly conflicting message is entirely foreign to most people. Altcoins and businesses have this centralized messaging, such as that coming out of Ver and Wu. Bitcoin doesn't and shouldn't. 
You can't correct this "problem" by giving engineers communicating skills. The issue arises because the ecosystem is leaderless by design. The lack of unified messaging is a feature and not something we should seek to correct. The answer is to instead continue to refute misinformation where it is espoused and direct to the public primary sources of knowledge used as the basis for refuting misinformation.

If I give you a signed transaction which you can publish to the blockchain to prove I paid you and reclaim your Bitcoin, is that centralized? No. It relies entirely on the decentralization of the blockchain for that proof to function, it doesn't matter that the transaction is happening entirely off chain between two people. Two people clearly are not a decentralized network, but the proof you will get paid is reliant on a decentralized network. Since you cannot attack this transaction by attacking anything other than the blockchain it is as decentralized as the blockchain is.

There are for sure some issues scaling lightning, I think the most pressing being the very heavy gossip protocol. That's why it is so important to be accurate about what those issues are. There is no issue with hostile nodes. You slip it in there right alongside correct information like there is a risk of an inadvertently stale chain state being broadcast and a fund forfeiture happening.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:06:11
Spamming the network is an attack on Bitcoin, not lightning, and it is handled by attaching a cost to transactions. Some people view the high fees of those moments of attack as a problem, the reality is those fees are a solution.
Front running transactions is primarily an issue with cross chain swaps over lightning, not the normal operation of the network.
DDoS of a node can be addressed by simply turning on TOR and using onion routing, making your node and channels private, or simply changing your IP and closing those channels.
The reality is lightning is trustless, there's not much of anything a sybil node can do to harm you.

Bitcoin is very groundbreaking, but it's not very accessible. Most users don't seek out protocols for technologies sake, they have a task in mind and just want to do it as well as possible. Bitcoin will realize its potential when it is eliminating and reducing risk, speeding up transactions, reducing complexity, and reducing costs for people that don't even know what Bitcoin is.
We need to do some work to get to that point. It's so many years of work ahead of us in a network which by design is going to be very slow to adapt. We'll keep gaining use cases and adoption along the way. It's fun to see the boundary of where we are, like exploring lnd or submarine swaps. It's not very user friendly, not very end user goal focused at all. But it will be the building block for decentralized exchanges, for inter-blockchain interactions and the many stacks throughout. That's where we are. Building blocks and platforms.
It's not that Bitcoin is early - you are! Be glad for it.

I'm learning that the commit fees in lightning are the responsibility of the channel opening party, and I learned a few days ago that commit fees are renegotiated constantly.

There are some rebalancing tools floating around the lnd slack but I admit I haven't used or tried them, but some people seem to be having success.
Centralization of hubs isn't a problem, and not really a good use of the term centralization.

The assets were not legally theirs for an entire year. You make my point for me.
They would have to sell the company to be solvent, much like hacked exchanges sometimes do. That does not make a hacked exchange solvent any more than Quadriga is.
Do you think a hacked exchange thats only mechanism of paying it's debt is to find a buyer is solvent? It absolutely isn't,  not until the moment a buyer is found. Things are only worth what you can sell them for and if no one wants to buy your hacked insolvent exchange you will remain insolvent - much as does Quadriga.

Of course there is none, if there was it wouldn't make much sense. Nothing decentralized has efficiency, it's all being done redundantly. That means the EVM is a good platform for code you want to run on everyones computer as opposed to one. Like decentralized exchanges or decentralized credit markets for example. Possible to do with Bitcoin and atomic swaps alone in both cases, but so much better to raise a layer and get that crud off the btc blockchain and into a higher abstraction where it is easier to code and maintain and scale.

No. Drivechains are governed by Bitcoin miners. The advantages rsk has over eth are numerous. For one it resolves to bitcoin, meaning you can run these contracts with BTC and rsk benefits from Bitcoins decentralization and marketcap. Rsk is also much better structured resulting in much smaller chain state data and even discardable chain data to further reduce centralization and scaling issues.

What bitcons does is make you your own bank. Congratulations, you are the proud owner of $50 dollars in a way you have never before owned $50. You are responsible for it's security and no one can tell you what you can or cannot do with it, you are financially sovereign.
You should start by securing your Bitcoin. Learn about moving your Bitcoin to your own wallet, backing up your wallet, signing transactions offline and storing private keys. The learning curve is steep enough to hang yourself on so don't be discouraged. Censorship resistance and financial sovereignty are worth it I promise.
Because we are so early in the life of Bitcoin and the value of being your own bank has been realized by so few people, the value will either skyrocket as people adopt Bitcoin or plummet as people abandon it. This make Bitcoin a good speculative asset. I use my Bitcoin as a form of long term savings and retirement fund. Sometimes it's up 100% other times it is down 90%, but if you hold for a couple of years it typically trends upwards.

ICO's are entirely unnecessary, they already are monetizing with a 20% dedicated mining fee. Private ICO's are shadier still.
They also clearly control the entire ecosystem, from who runs dapps to the entire currency used in higher layers to the dedicated fee. If Blockstream was getting a dedicated fee of 20% from every block you wouldn't call that centralized? It also literally is running a federated peg. It is by design centralized until their BIP gains any traction which it has so far failed to do.

Reserved commit fees may make some micro channels inoperable, but lightning if anything excels through spam attacks that limit onchain throughput.

I have never heard of anyone saying front running ln transactions without a swap involved is a problem. The idea that someone is going to rebalance the entire networks channel states in the matter of seconds when a route is being queried doesn't seem like a valid criticism to me and I would like to see a better description of the alleged attack vector. When people talk about front running transaction in ln they are always talking about swaps in my experience, front running the trades.

What part is confusing you? I have previously supported RSK and been very interested in the project but I won't any longer, and I list the reasons why:


1. I do not support new tokens especially ICOs and private sales and launches. I am interested in RSK because it runs on SBTC (now RBTC) and making a new speculative token the foundation of higher tier functionality is the opposite of what I am looking for.
2. RSK takes a dedicated 20% fee from miners on transaction fees.
3. The RSK BIP has received no traction and remains unnumbered. This means RSK will remain federated for the foreseeable future and not decentralized.
4. RSK remains permissioned, requiring registration to run dapps on.
What's not to get? As I have previously campaigned in favor of RSK I will now be campaigning against it. This cannot be the future we want for Bitcoin.

There are [17,468,850]( bitcoin already mined. That leaves 3,531,150 remaining to be mined.
Mining will never stop. The coinbase reward (the mining reward that mints new bitcoins from this 21 million pool) halves every 4 years into near nothingness but the transaction fees earned from mining will always be there. When there is no tangible reward from minting new bitcoin miners will still mine for the fees.
The lost coins impact supply, making the practical available supply much smaller than 17,468,850. Other than the impact on available supply and that some number of lost coins could some day be recovered by "quantum mining" they don't really matter.

Ahhh yes you are talking about the gossip protocol and propagating state change notifications, which is absolutely a scaling challenge that needs resolution right now. I don't think the solution is to add lightning fees, but to instead simulate an enormous network and just start attacking the bottlenecks. The gossip protocol as it exists today is ridiculously verbose and needs optimization badly.
In regard to front running, I don't think that attack is possible in practice just because of the way routes are queried, my understanding is it happens in parallel and in a very short window of time. You would both likely fail to rebalance before the transaction found another route and be routed around for failing to respond quickly enough.
If the "attack" is successful there sure isn't much consequence. If anything the attacker is providing a trustless service and ensuring liquidity. As far as attacks go even ideally not a lot is being accomplished and the "victim" isn't impacted at all.

A network is its participants. The entities running the protocol. Our miners and nodes cannot be copy and pasted.
The things that make Bitcoin unique from other crypto are the cost to attack it, it's turning non-complete, the isolation of features and risks by layer, its lack of founding entities, the only scaling plan that actually scales among others. Bitcoin is going to have its own ICO boom in the form of layers on top of Bitcoin. Layers which may or may not resolve to blockchains, allowing people to build things that scale. 90% of altcoins are Bitcoin forks because they don't have the skill, the funding, or the interested volunteer manpower that would be necessary to build the features themselves.

Anyone have any LND configuration advice? Been running almost a week on autopilot, ran into several already documented bugs like trying to make channels without accounting for fees. My biggest problem is I can't for the life of me get any bidirectional or incoming channels. I resorted to spending on one of my autopilot created outgoing channels, but apparently there is no route from any popular services to that channel and thus me either. I manually added the most connected nodes as peers hoping they would connect to me if I did them but no dice. I can't for the life of me accept incoming lightning payments without a routing error.
How can I configure lnd autopilot to only make bidirectional channels or encourage peers to make incoming channels?

No they are not. The fee to deposit fiat on an exchange + the fee to trade + the fee to withdraw + the onchain fee.

You realize that "custody" in this manner isn't a relevant term when referring to entities that predate bitcoin I hope.

Can there be any question that Coinbase is as qualified as any custodial solution, and certainly more qualified than one that doesn't exist? We aren't talking safety deposit boxes here.

1) No where near 100% of exchanges reserves will be tested by this action. What are you expecting to happen, a run on 10% of exchange holdings at best? Exchanges could be running severe fractional reserves and not be tested by this.
2) Because this campaign will never "prove" anything regarding exchange solvency its only purpose should be to get people off exchanges permanently. The idea that this will have any role in determining exchange solvency is offering those who sit on exchanges with their funds a false sense of security.

I think your specifics are way off, you wouldn't want to construct keys that way, but I agree that not having to offer your SSN to prove its ownership linked to a government database would be a huge improvement to handling SSN info which would no longer be necessary by corporations.
The trouble is SSN theft isn't the primary means of identity theft. You're wrong to suggest private database leaks are not the primary cause of identity theft of which SSN theft is a subset, and the solutions to proving a set of private information isn't useful for securing information a company requires in plaintext to act on. Companies don't often require proof of the data's existence and association, they need the plaintext address, credit history, credit card information to act on it.

You realize most bitcoin users transact much less than every day right? I send maybe 12 a year. Thinking transactions/day == userbase is such an unbelievable failure of logic. This isn't cult like dedication, it's a simple understanding of what bitcoin represents to computer science, to politics. Like I said in the very first comment, I have entirely different priorities than you do. Your priorities may even create a coin with a larger userbase - it is after all focused entirely on users and their experience instead of decentralization as the most unique network property in the world. But that isn't an argument bitcoin would fail. A variable number of daily transactions is not evidence of its impending doom which any observer can immediately tell by the many many common dips in transaction volume over bitcoins life.
If being in a cult is being blind to obvious evidence (like fee is down not up), or the contortion of obvious evidence to fit a preconceived notion unsupported by the evidence (like transactions per day falling at all indicates bitcoins impending failure) - then cult like thinking is a better description of your justifications for your views than mine isn't it? My argument is decentralization is bitcion, decentralization is function, decentralization is value. All the evidence points to these things being true. If you were right then altcoins would be more valuable and popular than they are since they are more feature rich and cheaper.

I do not at all think the first point is a problem. There is no upper bound to the monetary attack potential of a state actor and thus there must be no upper bound on the cost to attack Bitcoin.
In fact, Bitcoin can do more to stabilize the energy production lifecycle than any technology I have heard of. Power plants are expensive, and need to be built before population and industry exist in an area. When power companies can convert their otherwise wasted production into Bitcoin instead of flooding the market or going bankrupt everyone wins. It enhances accessibility and viability of inconsistent power production mechanisms especially like renewable sources.
I agree pollution of energy producers is a major issue, but that issue has nothing to do itself with Bitcoin. It's a regulatory issue.

The "chain" part of blockchain is an immutable chain of blocks. Each new block is built as a function of the last block. If you change one of the blocks in the chain it changes the output of the next valid block, and the valid block connected to that block, and so on through the entire rest of the chain. To change an old block would invalidate the chain and the client would notice.
If you tried to propagate a valid old block by mining a solution to a very old part of the chain and propagate that block, it would be rejected by all other clients since they are actively working on a  much higher valid block height.

You cannot sell something without someone buying it. Buyers can then turn around and sell whatever they bought at some point in the future. In this way we have an infinite pool of buyers and sellers so long as there is demand for the item.
Bitcoin is mined. If your question is what happens when the mining reward drops to 0, the answer is simply "nothing". Miners will still mine transactions to earn transaction fees. People will still buy and sell bitcoin based on the supply of people willing to sell and the demand of people willing to buy.

Why would that stop ASIC production? It's a multiyear investment in manufacturing and efficiency management.  Considering that manufacturers who get leapfrogged in efficiency still complete their initial production runs then so would people in a price dip. We've experienced many dips of the caliber you describe and never before has manufacturing stopped. The rest of your imagined scenario is rife with equally absurd and unfounded assumptions.


Believe what you want, there are many figures who publicly hold enormous sums of crypto. Facts speak louder than beliefs.
This conversation has made one thing clear to me: you live in an ideal fantasy. Instead of imagining your security model under adverse conditions you imagine it under the most ideal conditions. You dismiss adverse conditions not with real examples (like I do when I refer to miners being checked by nodes in a PoW system, or like ASIC manufacturing continuing in the face of price drops) but with hopes for the future which entirely ignore the past and assumptions about human psychology.

You are literally one of the stupidest people I've ever had to misfortune of arguing against, so let me make the argument you should be making FOR YOU.
1. Gravity has nothing to do with it. If you're going to assert a theory as correct you should at least fucking know what the theory is. Gravity nor tides are mentioned ONCE in this theory. You are just a moron who is making shit up to fill in their poor understanding of concepts.
2. The REAL theory is that moon cycles affect hormonal levels in mammals for evolutionary reasons, which is purported to have an effect on the stock markets of the world. This is stupid for entirely different reasons than you are stupid, as it ignores all the far more prevailing factors on human hormones. Why not a trading strategy based on seasonal depression?
3. The only evidence that exists supporting this theory is a loose correlation. There is no evidence beyond correlation reported anywhere. As I'm sure you do not know, correlation is not causation. The moon has a 29.5 day cycle. You are more likely to be tracking the monthly liquidity of money than you are measuring the cause of the moon. Even that is just a guess in the dark, because THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.
4. You should be embarrassed by the many many logical leaps of fancy you've made in this conversation. You're a stupid, stupid person. Think for yourself.
In sum, I'm done this conversation. You're so stupid that you're beyond saving, but at least you can hopefully learn about the things YOU believe. Stop talking about gravity. Stop asking for proofs of third grade mathematical concepts. You're done. Educate yourself.

Asking everyone you pay to accept bitcoin is just obnoxious.

What you call social anxiety I call a lack of shame, and despite how much I want bitcoin to succeed I would tell anyone I saw executing this bad advice to knock that shit off, they are making the rest of us look bad by association.

It's not political correctness it's literal correctness. It's not said to avoid hurting someones feelings but because it is a literal description of the technology. People who mistake or purposefully call Bitcoin Bitcoin Core either have an agenda in propagating that confusion or are in fact technically inept.
If the goal is clarity then correctness should be preferred. If the goal is pretending that some implementation of the bitcoin protocols developers have taken over the protocol as a whole (which they haven't) then sure, call the protocol Bitcoin Core - but lets not pretend that it can be anything other than malice or ignorance.

Just because this fork destroyed value doesn't mean all do. The original BCH fork on Bitcoin was considered a constructive step towards scaling and losing dead weight, and preceded ATH bullrun.

Are you sure about that? I want you to think through some of these conclusions of yours. What assumption about the assets performance have you made if you expect a coin flip on an investment to have a break even value? That an even distribution of buys and sells will cover an equal positive and negative performance of the asset. You could lose money, you could make money, you could pull even. Choosing to buy and sell with a coin flip would not result in a "breakeven expected value", and this is as easy to test as a tradingview script.
You just aren't thinking, that's what leads us to make fun of you and people like you.

Better bet especially if you are challenged for time and don't want to risk losing what you trade is cash in all your BTC forks. There seem to be new forks every month and they should bump your holdings a few percent. Move your current coins first obviously, no point risking exposing a valid private key, but other than that it's pretty low risk and the prefect way for the holders to make a little bit of extra coin.

No, his criticisms and assumptions are not accurate. Going over every single one for all 15 minutes would require more work than I think is reasonable. so lets just consider some brief points.
1. It's happening live right now, there isn't a need to speculate about what could or should happen - it's happening.
2. He makes several claims such as that every lightning node is discoverable (it isn't) or that it needs to be (it doesn't) or that the changing state of channels is an impossible and insurmountable complication (it's not). 
His assumptions are ill founded when they aren't outright wrong, and his conclusions don't even follow his assumptions. He doesn't understand nuances like that routing hints can be passed along with payment requests to discover unannounced routes - he has the layman's understanding of the technology which is probably why everything he explains is via analogy.
He is a perfect regurgitation of the non-technical half-understanding of lightning people in rogers sub endorse.
Lightning isn't perfect and has a lot that could be criticized as well as pending improvements addressing some of those criticisms. Videos like this are a disservice to that genuinely valuable discussion.

1) In traditional tech fields the consequence to moving fast and breaking things isn't the destabilization of a 150 billion dollar market. More than that, Ethereum is *not* on the cutting edge of anything. Adding turing completeness is not some mystery that needs solving, not adding it is a conscious choice. What *is* the cutting edge of the industry are concepts like disposable blockchain data (rootstock), drivechains and sidechains and federated pegs, atomic swaps, MAST, anti-fraud proofs tradable off chain like HTLCs, abstractions and compression like the lumino protocol, and Schnorr signatures. The cutting edge of this industry is **not** cryptokitties.
2) PoW has risks, but as a security model it has been proven time and again as superior to PoS systems. As an economic security model PoW requires an enormously large threshold to effect an attack, and with a balance of security mechanisms between miners and nodes there is an open question as to whether even a 100% miner compromise would result in an effective attack. People complain about the energy required to secure a PoW network and entirely miss the point. The energy required *is* the point, is the security. If you want to throw that away you might as well throw away the entire decentralized security model (which PoS does). The only argument necessary against PoS is that it has a lower cost to attack - absolutely and unequivocally. This lower cost to attack leads to the "necessary" actions such as hard forks which destroy the code is law and decentralized properties of the network. PoS is a self defeating mechanism.

Blockchain is an economic distributed security model.  The cost to acquire the overwhelming hardware to have full write permission is its main security function. More than that, if such a time were to happen when a majority of miners conspire together there are secondary security mechanisms such as nodes and forks. Nodes can refuse to propagate blocks from miners they perceive to be performing reorg attacks and they can also fork the PoW method in the most dire of circumstances. An attack like the one you are envisioning is necessarily immensely expensive and short lived.  The attacker would always make more money as an honest actor than they would attempting to attack Bitcoin.

As others have said they aren't fixed in size but have an upper limit. The reason for an upper limit is to reduce the accumulating and otherwise unbound size of the blockchain. The bitcoin protocol requires every node fully validate and store the blockchain, which increases in size every 10 minutes for its entire life. Certain attacks are possible such as spam attacks which will either bloat the blockchain by including large volumes of free and frivolous transactions, pushing the cost to store and validate that spam on users for the rest of time - or clogging the mempool if they aren't able to be put into blocks, where they increase fees for users before eventually being dropped from the mempool or published to the blockchain once demand lowers. By not allowing these transactions to enter blocks because they are priced out future nodes and users are spared the responsibility of validating and storing these transactions, and the spammers are forced to pay increasing sums of money in fees to perform their attack. It's an inconvenience for user to be sure, but it's a bigger inconvenience for attackers and is the only responsible stop gap solution to managing a blockchains ever-growing resource consumption.
Many miners publish empty blocks with no transactions other than the coinbase transaction (not the company, fuck the company), so blocks are very frequently smaller than the maximum limit. Some people even propose the max limit should be reduced to ~300kb. That's a pretty controversial proposal, for many users who don't understand the technical reasons why these limits exist it causes a lot of frustration. They just want cheap and instantaneous transactions, they don't really care how it's done.

So miners just stop mining and wait for a new block to be mined by algo  There are a lot of potential issues with that idea. For one you're splitting the economic cost to attack the network. Some investment will have to be made in algo  to make it as secure as the current mining environment, and pull investment from SHA256 as the cost to attack SHA256 lowers and algo  rises to meet it. Since SHA256 is still the majority of the network all you've done is reduce the cost to 51% attack the network by SHA256 miners - seemingly the opposite of your goals. You've also increased the risk of a "death spiral" due to low hash power on either algo, where transactions can't be published which drives away users and what little hash power remains for competing coins. I don't think this is a very good idea.

Bitcoin doesn't work like this.
Unless bitcoin is experiencing a literal 51% attack with reorgs, other miners will mine blocks. You will be losing not only the opportunity cost of mining transactions that you didn't pay for to make money, but you're also all the fees to blocks mined by miners who aren't you. Doing this is also immediately noticeable and a legitimate 51% attack with reorgs would trigger extreme defensive action from the network such as blacklisting nodes and potential PoW changes. More over if you are doing a 51% attack, which is a one shot deal, you're basically killing the value of the thing you're stealing. So you're spending money equivalent to that of a nation state at war to attack bitcoin for absolutely no gain except shooting yourself and bitcoin in the foot. Then bitcoin bounces back and you're broke. Even if you shorted every exchange in existence and borrowed every coin available you still would have pissed away an enormous sum of money because the volume available to borrow is dwarfed by the cost and risk of attack in this manner. Attacking bitcoin is a bad deal no matter how you slice it.

Is it a strawman argument to suggest that some functions are in conflict of each other in terms of priorities, and the best solution to meet all needs is an agreement between the two sets of priorities? Decentralization and rich functionality, decentralization and scale, these are at odds and in real life these camps are fighting like they can't both have exactly what they want. The reality is we can. You design your network, and lets make an agreement for how to take tokens between the networks. By leaning on each other and having a formal way of depending on each other, we can both benefit. These agreement are what we call the interaction between protocol layers. An example of such an agreement  codified would be things like lightning or side chains.
How is that unreasonable? It's how similar problems in the field have been solved forever and sacrifices no ones priorities. We can have our cake and eat it too. That doesn't mean we wouldn't or couldn't upgrade the base bitcoin blockchain if there was a reason to think it was necessary. It only means there isn't a very good reason to think it is necessary if you follow these common network development conventions at all.

It takes some serious mental gymnastics to believe that a market with volume in the billions per day is controlled by one guy who dumped .5 billion over 3 months. It takes even more stupidity to think that the other 1.5 billion dollars this guy has means he controls the market and all future purchases are paying him. The numbers don't add up against the volume, get off that crack rock.
It is amazing the way the tone here changes during a dip. Not only do all the Bitcoin haters come out to play but even the people using Bitcoin are struck suddenly stupid. Did you think last week that the Winklevoss don't control enough Bitcoin to crash the market too?

Sent a strongly worded letter to my bank (BMO) and will be following up with a letter to my MP. I view blocking transactions to competing companies and technologies as entirely unethical. IMO the entire chargeback risk is created by banks themselves through the outrageously slow and limited service the provide cryptocurrency companies like Quadrigacx, and that's when they aren't pressuring them out of business entirely like ntrust or vault of satoshi. Pressure like this causes transaction delays which cause chargebacks. The alleged high risk of chargeback these businesses have is entirely by action the banks have taken to make them high risk.
That a bank can tell me how I am going to spend my money, create discord in an industry then blame that same discord they created as the reason for suspending service entirely is dishonest and disturbing. I am moving all my services to a credit union if this policy isn't immediately reversed.

This description does not instill me with any confidence that this "attacker" knows how lightning works. He has built so much bullshit on top of incorrect premises like reserve requirements for channels and being able to control all the top fee transactions. This attack would forfeit all the attackers funds because the fees for on chain transactions could be as large as the entire channel balance of the attacker that the "victim" could publish and still keep all their money. I.E. kiss everything you've invested into this attack goodbye with zero returns. The victim can use any and all of the attackers channel funds as on chain fees as they are forfeit to the victim when they publish the on chain transaction. This attack is absurd on its face and premised on a total misunderstanding of how channels are closed and how on chain fees work.

Because the chain is immutable. Introducing mutability for any reason defeats the point. You remove trust from math and place it in people. We already have many excellent mechanisms for trusting people. What is unique about this space is not trusting people but trusting code and nash equilibriums.
From this perspective a group forking to restore their funds after a hack is literally an attack on the chain, and if it passes it's a successful attack. The chain is no longer immutable, it is political. If enough people can be convinced to change the prior chain state then politics is the security model.

I'm not saying that. I'm saying you could have spent 2 million in the past and have control of the network when it moves to PoS. Saying that people won't horde coins is absurd, everything we have seen in the crypto community indicates people will horde coins for a period approaching decades. Arguing that no one will buy that much because they don't have foresight is as easily disproved as looking at the horders.
Further arguing that it will become more secure as volatility drops is *completely missing the argument*, it's as secure as it ever was cheap - not as it ever was expensive and stable.
ASIC prices are volatile, but even their price volatility doesn't directly affect the security model. If you could buy for $1 49% of miners today, and tomorrow seeing as how EVERYONE had this opportunity, what do you think is going to happen to the difficulty? It's going to jump an insane amount, everyone is going to be competing with outrageous sums of hashpower, and your 49% has just become 1%. You do not ever have the opportunity to attack because of this price volatility in a PoW system because you will forever be competing against others trying to do the same.

If your hypothesis was true absolute no innovation would ever occur in China. Do you believe that is true? I think it's pretty obvious on its face that it isn't true, billion dollar replica market be damned. Hasn't stopped Chinese invention or innovation.
Copyright laws are key to creating a wealth gap, nothing more. Of course inventors would like to patent their things to make as much money as possible, and of course if its an option for them they have pursued it. That doesn't mean that without this incentive in place that they would either make no money, or so little money as to disincentive all entrepreneurial activity. There is pretty clear evidence that even in countries without patent law, or in countries with outrageous taxes, innovation and invention continues strong.

You can just google some Chinese inventions?
For one they have completely changed the construction industry, especially related to bridges (The SLJ900/32  by Beijing Wowjoint Machinery), highspeed rail (development of the latest generation of bullet train in an innovations arm race with their peers), and the design/construction of [mega structures]( , some of which are serving more people than even exist in North America.
The challenges the Chinese face are unique to them and require constant innovation in technique and design, even when they are borrowing techniques from other cultures.
Other things modern China has been on the forefront of: Cycling innovations (dockless bike sharing), city planning (entire cities built before a single resident lives there), monolithic lifestyle applications (wechat), innovative payment mechanisms (oyster card), [arms and munitions]( and research and development (of those mega structures several are research related - including the second largest telescope in the world and the  Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory). What do you think they are using that telescope for? Watching things Americans are doing so they can copy them? No. Original research.
Like I said, I'm sure I could go on for an entire essays worth. We haven't even covered innovations and techniques that originated in China.

Bitcoin does not depend on retailers acceptance or legality for success. The underground ecomony is huge, if even 10% of online gambling use bitcoin it would need a higher price than current to handle the transactional volume. If even 10% of illegal offshore holdings converted to bitcoin the price would have to be higher. If 10% of drug purchases are made with bitcoin it will mandate a higher price. There will always be a country willing to take advantage of the cash cow and legalize bitcoin exchanges and if there aren't it doesn't matter we can move those underground too. Bitcoin is evolving into a truly unstoppable juggernaut. I have absolutely no long term concerns about a world in which bitcoin becomes illegal. I don't intend to become a criminal but I am not afraid to if my government declares my p2p interactions illegal. I recognize no governments authority over a decentralized p2p network.

Propogation is an issue when it leads to incentive, i.e. far before anyone is out of business. Incentive leads to centralization, which is what we have been seeing happen in China. What matters when measuring miner decentralization surely isnt the success of mining businesses but propogation times, orphan rates, and geopolitical influence.
 You are talking about business a lot but decentralization is not the business community, it's a network property. Having only one kind of user with validating nodes is an enormous artificial limitation to decentralization and should never occur. Why have one kind of user acting as a party of trust in a trustless system? It's nonsense.
Everyone who relies on bitcoin must operate a full node or they are trusting someone, which entirely defeats the point of using bitcoin in the first place. If you are willing to trust someone just use a bank.

I 100% agree, Bitcoin must be able to endure attacks - it cannot care or diffirentiate.
However, in discussion about these issues like this one, there seems to be doubt that transactions created to specifically bloat the mempool are being pushed across the network. There is doubt that these transactions are making it to the blockchain. There is doubt at the measure to which this activity if it is occurring at all is impacting fees. These three negative properties are what are giving these transactions the colloquial "spam".
You can argue that this is the way it is supposed to be, the solution to spam is a fee market which forces the spammer to pay for the backend infrastructure securing the network and I think that's brilliant. That's what I believe. But to cast doubt on whether this spam exists and there is evidence of that is very dishonest. It is an attack. One we are hardened against, which won't disrupt service, and will cost the attacker an arm and a leg but it is an attack. Recognising it as an attack is an important matter in at the very least understanding how our decentralized security apparatus functions and how we are significantly more robust than centralized services. They struggle with resource consuming attacks all the time, DDoS remains one of the best ways to disrupt a centralized service.

No. You don't get to tell me or anyone else how to use Bitcoin. Holding is a completely viable use case, I'll buy more or spend when it suits me. So many use cases preclude spending and replacing like hedging against other markets or using Bitcoin as a savings account. Things that currencies are used for. Just because you and many others are obsessed with the transactional use cases of Bitcoin doesn't mean you should be telling everyone that is how they should use Bitcoin.
I won't ask if I can pay in Bitcoin. It is way more expensive for me to load fiat on to my local exchanges, buy, and withdraw than to pay directly with fiat. I am pretty sure as a payment strategy spend and replace is always going to be one of the most expensive ways possible to pay. I will instead withdraw Bitcoin from my savings when I need money and I will buy more Bitcoin when I have surplus money. That's how savings work, and it is one of many viable uses of Bitcoin that doesn't include spending it on everything possible.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:16:32
I keep my currency in my savings account. Sometimes I spend from it but often I do not, as I am at a time in my life where I prioritize saving and building for my retirement.
If I use Bitcoin as a savings account for my currency, to isolate me from the factors affecting my local and the global economy - am I a believer?
You have defined bitcoin as **one** use case. That's insane. It is dozens of ever shifting use cases, not the least of which is the worlds most decentralized ledger. Nothing makes the use case you envision special or privileged over the others. Sometimes use cases even go in and out of viability, like we saw with free transaction based services. 
Bitcoin is not a use case, it is  a network. This is why Roger freaked out, he sees *only* a use case in cheap global transactions. All other use cases are irrelevant to him. When bitcoin stopped enabling services like satoshis dice it was the loss of everything he cared about. Learn a lesson from Roger, don't expect Bitcoins use cases to be static and don't define Bitcoin as a use case.

You and I do not think about Bitcoin the same.
The price isn't bitcoin. People can speculate that it will be worth $0 or $1 million, doesn't change the protocol. Bitcoin is the protocol, and the protocol has value.
What Bitcoin has currently accomplished? Individual financial sovereignty. A pretty big thing if you ask me, and the foundation for any number of things to come.
The idea that bitcoin has to resonate with an audience or the price is manipulated by speculators - who cares? Any audience of any size stipulating a bitcoin of any price won't ever take away the freedoms bitcoin has given us. People can use it for any use case they can manage, including speculation, and it doesn't harm me or the protocol any.
Bitcoin has already achieved something amazing. It's the worlds most expensive to attack and first decentralized network. Waiting for it to do something more amazing than it has already been doing is not paying attention. It is liberating people and creating a foundation for further innovation and liberation. What more could you ask?
You believe Bitcoin needs to be backed by faith. It doesn't. It needs to be backed by use cases and demand. There is an ever present demand for a currency and store of value that exists outside national borders, which cannot be shut down or censored. So long as Bitcoin accomplishes decentralization, which it has proven time and again it does very well, it has use cases and it thus has value.

You couldn't be more top to bottom wrong. When you get your talking points from the bcash community you end up looking broadly ignorant. Please stop making constant posts full of misinformation and bcash talking points lest you earn a kick.


No measurable progress except released BIPs and example code and a flurry of git and meeting activity. Whether end users choose to engage in that progress is entirely up to them.


The blocksize is already ~1.5mb. You're advocating for a change that already happened.


Only if you have completely violated your own basic security practices including keeping a node online, having a watchtower, and are using poon dryja channels and not eltoo channels. Your point might as well be "if you lose your keys you lose your money."


This is a blatant lie. Not only are watchtower entirely altruistic at the moment and not necessary if you choose to maintain a high reliability node, but even when they do charge fees it is small and almost always paid out of the attackers balance which you get to claim as forfeit in a poon dryja.


Another blatant lie. This is not how routing hubs function, they are trustless.


Of course rebalance require an on chain transaction, why shouldn't they? Lightning is the effective batching of on chain transactions not the removal of onchain transactions entirely. This is a solved problem, check out submarine swaps and lightning loop.


Finally something remotely true. It's a trade off just like it is on the base network. Hot wallets have a different capacity than cold wallets.


The amount limitations are all client side and solely there to protect people who want to experiment with low risk. If you please (and many do) you can open channels or make transactions of whatever size you please.


Use this same logic to never use any financial software product again if you believe it. BCH, BTC, your banks website. All apply. Software has bugs and the recent LN one was absolutely no joke. The issue was one of nodes verifying chain state. You'll find that any software project that fails to verify state before acting on it is going to lead to a poor time.


Bcash just got double spent.

What people are willing to pay for it. Simple supply and demand says that so long as there is demand that exceeds supply price will go up. When all coins have been mined then supply will only ever go down from things like lost bitcoin. No one can tell you what demand will be at a given moment in the future. All they can tell you is that there will be 21 million BTC or less to be shared for all use cases.

Someone put up some amount of collateral to borrow $40 million dollars worth of BTC, and sold it with intentions to buy back the borrowed amount later at a lower price - making the money on the price difference. Then the price rose. Once the price rose enough that the borrower could not pay back their debt in borrowed BTC with the money they got from selling and their collateral, they were literally forced to buy back the bitcoin they borrowed at a higher price using the money they got from selling the borrowed bitcoins + their collateral, and were left with nothing. In short (hah, a pun), they gambled and lost. We call gambles which borrow something and sell it a short. Borrowing to buy is a long.
TL:DR; Someone gambled with a borrowed 40 million dollars and got rekt.

They kind of are mutually exclusive. In order for Bitcoin to be functional either transactionally, say for online gambling, or as a store of value and hedge to traditional investment then Bitcoin needs an inherent market capitalization that is equal or greater than the wealth being transferred or stored. Since supply can't move and demand will, that leaves nothing but the price to react. It is literally impossible for Bitcoin to be used for these things and not be a significant value. At $10 bitcoins there aren't enough bitcoins in the world to represent even 0.1% of online gambling transactions, let alone any other use case. If Bitcoin is a success (i.e. being used) it has to increase in value to function. Success and a double digit price are mutually exclusive.

I don't agree that running a different algorithm equates to an inherently more secure and decentralized network. Doing so would be throwing away the enormous cost to 51% attack sha256 bitcoin. Even now with a fair argument to be made 51% of miners are controlled by the same parties the systems incentives keep them in line, as you so eloquently demonstrated in August. Miners are not the beginning and end of our security apparatus.
We should wait years if necessary for mining manufacturing to become more distributed, relying on the security capacity of nodes to keep miners in line. One of those functions should certainly be to change PoW if necessary, but I find it very difficult to argue that now is when it is necessary, that now it will result in a more secure and decentralized network.

You can just google some Chinese inventions?
For one they have completely changed the construction industry, especially related to bridges (The SLJ900/32  by Beijing Wowjoint Machinery), highspeed rail (development of the latest generation of bullet train in an innovations arm race with their peers), and the design/construction of [mega structures]( , some of which are serving more people than even exist in North America.
The challenges the Chinese face are unique to them and require constant innovation in technique and design, even when they are borrowing techniques from other cultures.
Other things modern China has been on the forefront of: Cycling innovations (dockless bike sharing), city planning (entire cities built before a single resident lives there), monolithic lifestyle applications (wechat), innovative payment mechanisms (oyster card), [arms and munitions]( and research and development (of those mega structures several are research related - including the second largest telescope in the world and the  Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory). What do you think they are using that telescope for? Watching things Americans are doing so they can copy them? No. Original research.
Like I said, I'm sure I could go on for an entire essays worth. We haven't even covered innovations and techniques that originated in China. The idea that China doesn't invent or innovate anything is again, absurd on its face - even if you can't name a single one of its modern inventions or innovations.

Bitcoin is about being in control of your own money. If you aren't sure which is the real bitcoin don't buy. If you aren't prepared to control and be responsible for your own money don't buy. This isn't a get rich quick scheme and many people trying to use it as such have bankrupt themselves.
This is the wild west of money. You'll never really know for sure what the market will do, even a person in the space for half a decade like myself with a clear technological understanding for why I dislike bitcoin cash versus bitcoin can't tell you the crowd won't be manipulated into choosing one over the other. **Do not invest more than you are willing to lose**.
Just because a technology is better than another (as I believe bitcoin is superior to bitcoin cash) doesn't mean it will be adopted. History is littered with examples of superior technologies falling to inferior ones. We all here are **lucky**, not savants, and anyone asserting otherwise is victim of survivorship bias.

Is he asserting that bitcoin protocol development has stagnated or that bitcoin growth has stagnated over the last 3 years? While its true this scaling debate has raged, both growth and development have been anything but stagnant. If his argument is that we need 2mb blocks because we will stagnate otherwise I believe there is concise proof to the contrary in the developments of the last 3 years.
I would support a hard fork if anybody gave me a reason to do one. It should be clear that demand for scale isn't a valid reason with current growth options in segwit and current mempool congestion. Neither is the reason "I promised" a good reason. The idea we should compromise any minor degree of decentralization for an unneeded feature seems insane to me.

The risk reward ratio isn't 1:1. You can make an equal number of buys and sells - but what happens if on one of those sells the asset jumps 50% on big news? What if on one of those buys it does the same? The buys and sells will be balanced but the asset performance won't be - which is exactly what you would find yourself if you tried testing your theory on tradingview or in real life. The result is you might make money, you might lose money, you might break even. No one could tell you. An even distribution of buys and sells doesn't equate to breaking even in asset performance.

Altcoins don't value decentralization the way bitcoin does. It is the first truly decentralized network on the planet and currently by far the most decentralized. It also has the strongest economic security model.

There is going to be a revolution in the way custodial exchanges operate. Proof of reserves, withdraws enabled even when the company is bankrupt and defunct, assured state of funds, and user defined balances between custodianship and self control. They could be doing all of this now, they choose not to because it's more profitable to be holding everyones money in a trusting capacity.

You can explain it all you want, you should read the text you keep quoting. It is a protocol. A protocol is a standard for organizing information and coordinating tasks. It is accomplished with software in the scope of network protocols. Almost all cryptocurrency protocols are forks of Bitcoin. Those are the absolute facts and they are indisputable. 
No one has been talking about "blockchain" until you introduced the word to the conversation. The title and every comment says Bitcoin not blockchain. Bitcoin forks have been a thing for long before Bitcoin blockchain forks have been.
No one is lacking an understanding except your lack of semantic comprehension. BCH was also not even close to the first intentional blockchain fork. Clams came years before it among others.

Bitcoin has smart contracts too you know. The point we are making is that rushing Turing complete contracts into production is very dangerous and there is a litany of evidence to that point in Ethereum. The safer and more sustainable way to build Ethereum like features is in segregated layers where the chain data is more scalable and doesn't affect the underlying chains decentralization or function.
The fact that an 11% owner is an unacceptable security risk in a ecosystem with such a huge premine really describes all the problems with PoS coin. Saying it's a PoS we have to fork to stop this person from owning so much eth is an absurd security foundation on which to build a coin. It includes centrally directed control and insanely low limits of attack.

People are a very poor judge of the technical properties of the protocols they use. Evidence from the Ethereum fork indicates people largely do not care about the immutability of the blockchains they use. If in the long term this fields success relied on end users accurately predicting valuable protocol properties then it would be doomed to fail. Most people are not network engineers, are not computer scientists, are not cryptographers. People on average, even those involved in this space, have very poor understanding of the future we are building through Bitcoin. I strongly disagree that the most popular blockchain is inherently the most usable blockchain. It may have the most use but in practice it may be nothing more than a centralized computing process masquerading as a decentralized one. Centralized processes are very usable and have an enormous demand, but that doesn't make for a well designed blockchain.
People can jump on any bandwagon they want. They can gamble, they can lose and make fortunes. It doesn't really matter. Decentralization is not a business model. It does not live and die with short term adoption figures or the success of its central foundation. So long as Bitcoin has decentralization we have nothing to worry about. Whether the average person recognizes the value of that decentralization or not, its value of a censorship resistant network and transfer of value will exist and be utilized by those who do. Nothing will be able to take that away from us.

If you are keeping a hot wallet without engaging in enterprise level security you have no one to blame but yourself.  Custodial exchanges are the antithesis of Bitcoin, which is the only asset you can uniquely control and transfer globally without a custodian.

The issue in this case was the merchant had no idea how to get support, and my attempts to get support were rebuffed. Merchants need more hand holding is I think the lesson at the end of the day. This merchant commented when they did refund it that they had no idea this expiry happened and even with some investigation it was not at all obvious what had occurred from their perspective.

If you genuinely feel that way you need to buy BCH as it most closely follows the white paper. BTC does not follow the white paper in anything but spirit - we've made advances to consensus, address format, nearly everything to where the white paper is no longer an accurate description of how Bitcoin function - including the many mistakes you keep making about chain length consensus.

In my personal and business life I continually find was to reduce trust by using Bitcoin. That you can't speaks to your lack of imagination.
Just last week in fact we came upon a situation where a client wanted a less trusting solution for dealing with charge back reserve requirements for merchants, so we created a 2 of 3 multisig as escrow between us and a lawyer. We have plans to take the lawyer out of the equation and just make it trustless.

Holding is genuinely fantastic long term advice, it's effectively a binary bet on "will bitcoin be successful". It's also the only way to realize the function of bitcoin, which a great many of us are here for instead of the price.
Framing everything like it's an investment vehicle alone instead of a utility laden protocol may lead "hold" to seem like scammy advice, but bitcoin is not strictly an investment vehicle. That might be what some use it for, but for me that's just an added bonus to my savings account.

This is the wild west, I call you stupid because you would rather listen to an ad you saw on TV or some random Redditor than do the one thing this space requires: trust no one, verify yourself.
Me telling you to use another exchange does you no good when tomorrow that exchange decides to limit withdrawals or sign a document like the NYA. You need to learn to do this stuff and evaluate it yourself.

My point is it's not impractical and is absolutely necessary for the security of the network. Coinbase is attacking BTC consensus and adoption - that is proven and admitted. It's not up for debate.


It doesn't bother you that Coinbase is selling its consumers on the idea that they are using Bitcoin when in reality they aren't using Bitcoin but Coinbasecoin, and they are functionally doing nothing different than opening a SUPER HIGH RISK bank account that could be hacked at any moment and receive a haircut. And that Coinbase is profiting in the hundreds of millions off this lie.

The futures market is centralized meaning the only counter party risk is with whatever futures market you choose - regulated or not(bitmex). That's a very different risk profile than "is your startup going to go bankrupt?" and in our clients situation, is a more desirable one. The only trust he has to have is that the futures contract he chooses in fact resolves and if it doesn't - he only loses the difference on the Bitcoin price movement not everything. He can see the Bitcoin he has potential access to and the conditions of that access, he has full control over his own short, and because we executed when futures were above spot he's making money on the futures/spot spread.  It's a win for everyone compared to gambling that his money will be taken like it has been in the past or our start up will fail unexpectedly - he's a high risk business and has been shut down by the likes of stripe and paypal before.
You're right it isn't decentralized trust - only the Bitcoin part of it is. But by relying on that decentralized trust my business can create better risk profiles for our b2b large scale business. As we lean more and more on the decentralized trust elements - for example the next contract we do this with won't involve a lawyer - we continue to beneficially change that risk profile.
I think it's good business and a great example of how to use Bitcoin to solve business problems literally today, not in some distant layered future. I also think I've done you a great charity in bothering to explain it at all.

2014 PEAK BTC transacted daily was 2,075,231 on Dec. 13 2014 with a BTC value of [$348.98]( for a total value transacted of 724,214,114.38 onchain.  Average was closer to 400k and $150 or $60 million.
On the most recent day I have data for, Friday the 13th, we saw 740,316 onchain BTC transacted and it was a below average transaction volume day for the year to date. Even still, 740,316 BTC was worth ~$6240 on Friday which means that even on a low day in the year we saw 4.6 Billion in onchain transactions. This obviously dwarfs the 0.7 Billion of the highest day of 2014 let alone the more likely $60 million.
All this not including any offchain transactions or economic activity including the vast majority of institutional activity and new users who operate almost exclusively on custodial exchanges.

Ugh, bad shake friend.
All you can really do at this point is run an incident analysis to figure out what happened. We know obviously Bitcoin wasn't hacked, and it's unlikely that the electrum server is acting maliciously. The most likely cause is somewhere along the chain of custody of your private key there was a mistake. Maybe check that you're running a version of electrum with the right checksum. It sounds like it was a hot wallet on a well used consumer laptop, which is just asking for trouble if that's the case. If you are running that kind of hot wallet you'll never know what happened but can assume your device is compromised.
Consider it a lesson learned and hope the lesson wasn't too expensive. Sign transactions offline and keep air gapped custody of your private keys. Sorry friend.

Tl:DR: You and a set of peers can use Schnorr to create an "adaptor sig" which is your sigs combined plus *t*, a secret. Since every participant can create the required schnorr sig from their private key, *t* effectively becomes the lock. You can thus create an adaptor sig across multiple chains using the same locking script and *t* will be published when anyone unlocks it - thus enabling the unlocking across all chains as soon as it is unlocked on one. This is a unique kind of atomic swap as *t* can actually be rebound multiple times, creating long chains of atomicity.

You are literally redefining words, it is semantics. What you mean when you say 'fork' is not what others mean, as evidence by the definitions you cite which contradict you. Further evidence includes the fact that your definition couldn't even have existed before a year ago, and obviously the use of fork in this space and Bitcoin predates that by over half a decade in very common use. The only reason you think with these definitions you have created is you haven't been around here very long.

The attacks aren't trivial, they are sophisticated and rely on the weight of billions of dollars in capital and millions of users. You couldn't perform them, and neither can I.
We should be worried, we have the decentralized security model and to utilize it requires we be worried. Part of that model is guys like me making a big stink about Coinbases behavior. We defeated their last fork attempts, they haven't succeeded in driving their users to BCH in any volume as they have publicly stated they want to do, but that doesn't mean they never will. The larger the percentage of our userbase that is active and aware and defending the decentralized security model the more secure we will be.
The difference between trustless, Bitcoin driven layers using Bitcoin units and tokens on and offchain versus a company operating an internal accounting and financial services accepting deposits and withdrawals in Bitcoin is a world of contrast. If you can't see the difference between Coinbase and lighting or rootstock I can't help you.

I don't expect everyone to agree with you or every business to use this symbol, but I do expect a general consensus regarding a symbol to emerge as demand for a symbol increases. We're not all going to agree in this thread or walk away using the symbol and that's how it should be. Also refer to this argument for denominating Bitcoin as bits or mbits.

So just to be clear, you have invented a new definition for the word "fork" and it means:
* exclusively a hardfork
* with MULTIPLE chains that produce blocks to this day
By your definition if BCH had caused the BTC chain to be abandoned it wouldn't have qualified as a "fork" since there aren't two chains producing blocks after.
You are literally making up words and insisting everyone uses them that way despite your own evidence and source contradicting you.

Bitcoin is not a consumer economy. Bitcoin spent does not equate to wealth creation in any way. It does not create jobs, it does not increase GDP. Increasingly the entities transacting in Bitcoin will be machines, employing no one in the first place. The concepts you are applying are foreign and inapplicable. There is no need to incentivize spending for Bitcoin to function or have value as a desirable asset the way a government printed currency would require those things. There is no government to keep running, people to pay, and economy to grow. If no one transacted in Bitcoin ever except to buy and sell as a store of wealth it would still function perfectly fine as both a decentralized network and as that use case. That's the difference between a protocol and a country. A government needs money to function and a population need jobs to employ them, a protocol doesn't. Bitcoin will only ever compliment government issued currencies not replace them, they need inflation to function.

If Bitcoin is a blockchain why can't it run without its network participants. You are not only misinterpreting the white paper, but you're just wrong as can be plainly described. Bitcoin cannot be its blockchain.


Some of us are using a phone and very little time to instigate the tantrums you're throwing. Its worth it.


That's actually not how it is defined. The white paper is wrong, and has been wrong for some time. If you want to treat the white paper as a religious document you'll be welcome at rbtc. The longest chain doesn't define Bitcoin, the most accumulated PoW does. This was changed years ago. Longest chain was a very naive mechanism of consensus.

In what world do you live where 400k &gt; 740,316? If you want to compare busiest days 2018 still dominates 2014 in BTC transacted at 3.128 million BTC transacted on Jan 27 2018 which was worth ~11500 per BTC or ~36 Billion USD onchain transacted in that day.
There isn't a metric by which you are correct.
The *value* of BTC has risen 20 fold since the busiest day in December 2014. No matter how you want to denominate it. Lambos, USD, BTC. 1 2018 BTC has more value and is more desirable more than 1 2014 BTC.

Bitcoins governance very much resembles the Internet Engineering Task Force. You can think of BIP's like RFC's and the entire open source community as the IETF, where a group of seasoned and volunteering professionals in their space weigh in on issues and the goal is to **address outstanding dissent**. There isn't a vote, there isn't a hard and fast political process that is easily game-able. There is a bunch of experts transparently commenting on issues until there is a general consensus and the reference client gets updated with the proposals. When there are disagreements of substance (or politic) the minority group forks (Bcash). It's overall a very useful governance system anyone can participate in by simply commenting on the mailing list, github, and in the weekly IRC meetings.
A BIP is adopted however not by the developers, but by the community. Developers will add code which remains inactive via the process described above, and it's up to user to signal a date for everyone to enable it and a majority of users to then follow through.

The manipulation is easy as is meeting minimum volumes. A coin can only trade with whatever available volume you release of your premine. The incentive is also obvious. If you can establish a price history it will enable you to slowly introduce additional sell pressure until you make much more than you ever would have releasing the entire supply to the market before establishing a beneficial price history.

That's what that use case is exactly. Consider that specific use the equivalent of a centralized sidechain where trust ultimately resolves to whatever mechanisms you fashion around the oracles. Rootstocks pre-BIP state is very much this, using oracles to form a federated sidechain. The value in this is they can't steal your bitcoin/assets if they are violating the pegging mechanism, for example. You get a centralized company that you can engage with economically but don't have to provide full custodial trust while you interact with them.
It doesn't devalue non-oracle requiring use cases at all or make the oracle requiring ones any less superior to the traditional opaque process of asset exchange.

I am holding, have been for years, and do not use it solely as an investment vehicle. I and the many like me who use bitcoin to build smart contracts and reduce trust in their life are not merely investing. We're participating in a  revolution of trust.
I would never hold any other crypto as I believe they are functionless without bitcoin's pow and tried/tested decentralized security model.
The argument behind holding is as simple as "function, utility, and price increase as a function of time" and "a long term bet is a much safer gamble than trying to time the market. Better to bet on whether bitcoin will be useful at all than what the price will be on Sunday." More than that,t he argument is supported by the thousands of people like me who have been doing it for years.

1. How do these coins keep getting siezed? I cannot imagine the stupidity required to insecurely store nearly 300 BTC.
2. This guy was kidnapped and the police called to rescue him from his extorters, only to do the exact thing themselves over *marijuana*?! I view the state action as worse than the original kidnappers frankly.
3. For a state and its citizens to be so proud of such disturbing behavior as ruining this guy's life because he needed police help and grew weed is unbelievable. Who do you think has a bigger negative effect on UK society - this guy or money laundering banks? This guy or corporations that are preying on the poor with advertising and fake "sales" that are driven by professional psychologists? This guy doesn't move the needle and got burned for needing help. Fucked up.

It is very different from comparing the NASDAQ to the NYSE, those are both stock exchanges. Bitcoin is not a stock exchange.the commonalities between Bitcoin and stocks end at "you can buy them both, and their value may change as a function of time". Beyond that they are as different as two things can be. One is a protocol redefinition of trust via the decentralized security model and the other is a bunch of businesses, commodities, derivatives, and financial products. That Bitcoin has a financial unit at all is simply a necessary quirk of the incentives which create decentralized consensus.
Not that it would matter, because as I said there is no Bitcoin content in the OP save half a sentence. It's not relevant and shouldn't be here.

Because the impact of gravity on a given human body across the globe, as impacted by many factors beyond just the moon, experiences much more variance than the moons relative position imposes. Even if there wasn't so many more gravitational factors affecting the body than the moon, there is no relationship known or reason to believe a relationship exists between gravitational forces on the body and popular trading actions. It's just nonsense. Without any evidence at all beyond sheer speculation the argument is no better supported than an argument that bodies have a spirit that leaves them after death.

Ahhh so it's both. If only there was a word for network participants and the standard they use to communicate and accomplish tasks. Could we call it a PROTOCOL? and we'll call the datatype our protocol uses a Blockchain! Brilliant.


The white paper is not a reference document to Bitcoin and describes a system that is not implemented as Bitcoin. It is a historical document and little else. It does not reflect reality of the BTC network.


I like that this made your brain explode and have a tourettes fit. Do you actually not know this or think it's not true? I'm not going to bother citing you sources you won't read, I'm going to let you continue thinking Bitcoin consensus is defined by the longest chain and not the most accumulated proof of work. You being so stupid and so excitable about it is fucking fantastic.
Again, keep quoting the white paper - it doesn't refer to the Bitcoin you use. Bitcoin does not meet the whitepapers implementation definition and hasn't for the vast majority of its existence.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Clients make up the principle participants and constructors of the protocol. To say that a fork is only a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain is an unreasonably narrow definition.

We have been refering to again for example Litecoin as the principle fork of Bitcoin since it's inception.

So instead of giving me an example as you promised you insist I don't need it. I need it because my client doesn't trust the state of the funds at a given moment.


Being your own bank isn't holding a private key under your mattress. That is not how I do enterprise or personal security. Drug dealers having their funds seized is not the same as funds being seized from a smart contract with specific release conditions.


It means we can only access the funds as described by the terms of the locking script. They aren't available for us to misuse except in the limited terms described both legally and in our locking script. Again, my intention is to increase the complexity of that locking script beyond checkmultsigverify.
The fraud you're talking about happens at custodial exchanges which is exactly what the solution we are using avoids. We can't misuse the funds. it's amazing how good you are at pointing out reasons why this Bitcoin solution is superior to traditional custodial alternatives! You do get it!


So proud of you, learning about cash and carry arbs! You should read it though, not just link it:




The arb is just icing on the cake, this is a solution that ended up making this client money. It won't always, but it will still be cheaper once we get the lawyer out. this is a transition from centralized solutions to increasingly decentralized ones where appropriate.


They don't have the unique trustless properties that makes this a valuable solution in this escrow. There are other traditional solutions to this problem, but the Bitcoin solution has advantages our client values - and maybe others will too. I hope we expand it.
You're welcome for the lesson, I hope you learned something because it sounds like you're getting closer to reason.

The hidden camera footage in the article clearly shows the disclosing of using the coins to purchase stolen identities by the undercover cop to the suspect, the article somehow misses this point entirely. There's no bitcoin related crime that occurred here just 18 USC 1960 like n0mdep suggests. This guy was probably targeted though due to his experience with bitcoins and his likeliness to cooperate when threatened. For the conviction to be held as a PR trophy is also quite remarkable considering its total lack of implications.

If Coinbase did everything in their power to encourage and teach their users to secure their own Bitcoin (and would stop trying to usurp the protocol) I would have a lot nicer things to say about them.

How do you feel about the characterization that you aren't building a social media platform as much as you are a gambling platform?
Selling this idea as a social media platform seems really disingenuous to me. The curation mechanism is easily gamed by companies seeking discounted advertising, discounted because they stand to recoup a significant sum of their advertising budget through kickbacks if not outright profit. By design it doesn't seem to function as a social platform or content aggregation platform nearly as well as it will function as a platform for investment, gambling, and sponsored advertising.

I don't see Bitcoin the same way you do. Bitcoin isn't cash, it is trust. It works regardless of what the fee is. The most important thing for the network is maintaining decentralization and scalability, both of which would be diminished by expanding the blocksize or weight limit without good justification.
If their comes a point where scaling cannot succeed because of a lack of onchain space for layers to responsibly function and all other optimizations have been considered and deployed, then it may be time to have that conversation. That time clearly isn't now.

Yeah. they all said that fork meant something else and you meant to use hardfork, but we now know that's not even true as you didn't mean hardfork, you meant a hardfork with multiple perpetuating chains.
Quote for me **ANY DEFINITION ANYWHERE** that agrees with yours.
Even by the definitions you continue to cite such as:


It is clear that that includes ALL HARDFORKS including even ones that are not being currently mined such as the Aug 8 2010 one as you could start mining now if you chose and it contains a shared blockchain history back to the genesis block.
You are presenting all of this evidence against yourself. I'm not involved.
Also since you seem to be having some sort of Tourette's like tic happening I will say again Bitcoin is a protocol. It is not it's blockchain. We know this because the blockchain is a principle component of Bitcoin and thus necessarily cannot itself BE BITCOIN.

You will need to provide a seemingly unreasonable amount of transparency if you expect anyone to take you seriously, since your claim is fantastic.
You will also have to provide your first offering at a steep discount and limited supply to earn trust, but you can compensate by jacking up prices and volumes on 2nd+ batches.

Asking everywhere you spend fiat to take bitcoin even if you know they won't is evangelizing in the worst way. It's unsolicited, it's selfish (you're doing it despite knowing in some instance the answer is no, so the only thing you're accomplishing is stroking your own ego). Call it being a door to door missionary, call it being a telemarketer - doesn't matter. The employees at these businesses are just trying to do their job and 9/10 interactions you have with fiat will not be made with the business owner directly. Anyone who does what the OP is suggesting is wasting everyones time and making bitcoin supporters everywhere seem more annoying.

This post is mocking the lack of success in price and market density of Bitcoin Cash, one of Bitcoins many competitors and clones. Bitcoin Cash is focused on transactions per block as opposed to decentralization like Bitcoin is. These clones like to market themselves as the "real" bitcoin (there are about a half dozen at this point) but as you can see by the right axis, these coins are worth a fraction of what Bitcoin is worth and have very shallow markets.

I like the part where they insist you need to check the first and last characters of an address, but would be better off manually checking each character.
Someone doesn't realize the end of a BTC address is a checksum. If the last 8 characters are correct the address is correct, save a collision.

Bitcoin is actually massively inefficient as a distributed centralized database. Querying read and write times to a comparable distributed relational cluster would be thousands of times faster and require orders less performance. No CPU time spent hashing redundantly, no hard limits on when you can and cannot write to the databases. Relational cluster databases are literally made for this job. Your comparison to the borrowing of torrent technologies for centralized pairing doesn't hold water, the blockchain is a horrible database system for a trusted centralized cluster.

They could attack BCH at any point. BCH has only 10% of BTC's hashrate, there are many actors with more hashrate mining BTC than the entire BCH network - a double spend attack is stopped strictly by benevolence right now. 
It would be trivial for these large miners to begin mining in secret on the BCH chain from a forking point of their choosing, withhold the longer chain for as long as necessary to commit fraud against an exchange and exit, then publish the longer chain potentially reversing all the transactions between then time of resolution and the fork point, including the attackers deposits.
There was a video of one of the exchanges CTOs explaining this I wish I could remember and find right now as an explanation for why they wouldn't consider adding BCH. It's a very real attack vector that is possible at any time.

The cost of mining, AKA the cost to attack - is going up. That's because our network is maturing and so is its security. If you want BTC you don't need to use an exchange, trade it peer to peer. Any individual can run a full node and act as a fully validating participant in the network.

In this paper you note that modelling the value of DN's "is not an easy task" and that "We consider some simplifications to keep the analysis tractable."
How concerned are you with the impacts simplifying this model has on your conclusions?
An example: "In the case of DNs, such as Bitcoin, a helpful feature is its digital P2P character: all users and verifiers are connected to each other and thus the topology is near-complete." Is this a valid assumption when no mechanism in the network topology identifies "users"? It seems that any definition for users should expand beyond full nodes especially when considering valuation.

They haven't succeeded yet, and their previous failures have led to them attempting to circumvent the Bitcoin network all together. They are strongly supporting BCH because BCH enabled the changes coinbase wanted to see in BTC.

This is the problem with the businesses in the bitcoin space - no concern at all for decentralization just for acquiring users and making decisions on their behalf for the best user experience because the best user experience equates to more money in their pocket.
Tony Gallippi and Bitpays priorities are not my priorities. I care about decentralization first and foremost, without decentralization we are at the whims of companies and governments. Everything else has to come second.
There's a way to have decentralization and scaling and a good user experience, but why would these companies care to when it's harder than just maxing blocksize? We need to make them care by taking away their customers and campaigning against them.

In every way RSK is a generation ahead of Ethereum. There is no ICO or token, it relies entirely on Bitcoin to function and for decentralization. It has much more optimized resource usage including disposable state data so the chain can prune itself. It is in every way what Ethereum should have been - a layered solution on top of Bitcoin enabling full interoperability and segregation from the main chain for scaling and safety. It even runs exactly the same code Ethereum does for smart contracts by reimplementing the EVM. It is Ethereum 2.0

I think topping up a channel is a fairly low priority transaction, and high priority transactions like fraud proofs can consume the entirety of the offenders channel balance in fees if they want to. 
Segwit adoption takes time. Lightning adoption takes time. When these technologies aren't fully adopted and the network gets maliciously attacked you should expect fees to rise. That's how the network defends itself. If we bumped up the block size every single time we were attacked the way a dynamic block size would we would end up storing limitless attack data on chain forever.
A high fee bitcoin is still a completely working bitcoin. I've had to pay a $50 fee. It was worth it to be able to use bitcoin despite being attacked and be included in the next block. Any other service experiencing a resource consumption attack like that would have been entirely unavailable.

A protocol is literally a shared set of rules, a consensus. A decentralized protocol is one which has no single point of failure. Taking out one or many participants does not disable the protocol.
Decentralization is not a binary property. Its strengths and weaknesses vary by implementation in protocols and hierarchical models - of which bitcoin is definitively not.  Every node and every hash are equal there is no hierarchy just a division of labor.

There have been deliberately dishonest attacks on bitcoin, and people have fallen for them too. About 10% of the community judging by Bcash. Does that make every stupid person, or tricked person, or conspiracy theorist **deliberate** in their attack? I'm not so sure. They think they are being measured and reasonable. No one thinks that they are a conspiracy theorist or were dumb enough to fall for propaganda. Of course they rally together and find support among each other to validate their ideas. What else would anyone have expected to happen? By removing their insanity from this community we effectively gave up on ever convincing them they are wrong, hardened their belief that they are correct, and personally motivated them to evangelize against us. That's what has caused the Bcash movement.

That article is really poorly written. None of the authors observations are inherently wrong, just very short sighted. He's right to say there are too many centralized points of failure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but every day that situation is improving with protocols like Bisq. He's right to say people are applying blockchain as solutions to problems that don't exist, but he's also ignoring real and relevant use cases of Bitcoin.
The move from centralized to decentralized trust will take decades. I think people have been tricked by the rapid pace of the post dot-com internet company development boom into thinking that's the speed at which protocols mature and evolve - but it's not. So very few people critical from the outside have an appreciation for how early days it still is. It's like those people in videos from 1994 shitting on the internet - their criticisms weren't wrong based on their observations at the time, they just lacked the foresight to see what it would become.

There are good reasons to be a Bitcoin maximalist. 99% of jobs do not need to reinvent the blockchain, those that do should be bound to Bitcoin to give their blockchain attributes of trust and decentralization, like RSK.

The issue is one of segregation. We don't want these bugs affecting the main chain. Ethereum has proven over and over how dangerous their environment is, the development team was very involved in the DAO construction and subsequent fork. If you can't trust the people who invented the road to build one, and you sacrifice your "code is law" mantra and decentralization to deal with the bugs, what does that say about the environment as a whole? The entire space is rife with vulnerable smart contracts.
This is why we have RSK. Segregated layers relying and resolving to Bitcoin are the appropriate way to implement risky feature sets.

By all accounts Vitalik is a very intelligent and benevolent dictator. He has been an excellent steward of the protocol from any centralized or traditional perspective. Ethereum gains many beneficial properties from this relationship, including a strong advocate, educator, and properties of regulatory intervention (the DAO fiasco was resolved to the expectations of traditional antifraud measures as opposed to the priorities of decentralization). These are excellent properties if you are less interested in decentralization than you are redundancy and accountability.

Of course there are legitimate ICOs, Ethereum is one of them. Doesn't change the fact that if you see an ICO you should be highly suspect. If you see a project without an ICO it is significantly more credible inherently because they aren't asking you for money and thus avoid a conflict of interest where more funding is the priority not honest dissemination of information.
If RSK had an ICO, or Lightning, they would be significantly inferior projects compared to their current value propositions. We don't need more tokens, we need Bitcoin interoperability.

Economic scaling (I.E. the fiscal cost of performing an attack on the network through the purchase of miners, network infrastructure, or influence) exists with or without difficulty stepping due to the always increasing efficiency of miner manufacturers and competition for mining rewards. There is only 3600 coins a day, soon to be half that. Competition for those coins creates increased economic security I.E. more hash power and an increased cost to match that hashing power.

Not until it's ready for full public release. Why bother paying to build hype when you could be paying to develop code? That's not how open source projects typically work. They don't have marketing departments. Only for profit companies do because there is a profit motive to doing so, and that includes ICO companies. The closest open source projects get to marketing departments is when evangelicals form in the community, much as I am evangelizing Bitcoin here to you now. No one pays me for it, I do it because I'm passionate and believe we're changing the world. That's the difference, being paid and leveraging money to get the message out.

I don't support your movement. I think it is short sighted, static, and manipulative. Many people have attempted it before you and many will attempt it after you, and I won't support them either. Trying to price bitcoin in a way to manipulate people into purchasing it not based on its functional or speculative value to them but because the numbers were psychologically appealing is the kind of get rich quick bullshit I want Bitcoin to have nothing to do with. If an investor can't decide to buy Bitcoin because a number seems too high then they don't actually understand bitcoin and probably shouldn't buy any. Those are the kind of people who end up seriously hurting themselves with their investments. I'm not interested in taking advantage of them. If Berkshire shares can find informed buyers at 300k+ per share then so can we.
I don't care about human readability. Human readability is for UI, and most UI support millibitcoins. That makes this a non-problem from my perspective - if the issue is one of function then it has already been solved.

I guess I just don't view general stubbornness and cultural inertia as valid reasons for depriving your users of low trust or trustless banking solutions - which is effectively what a custodial exchange (and the company I work for to a degree) does.
In fact, I find those reasons to be downright offensive justifications for why we can't make peoples relationship with money and the parties they allow to handle theirs less trusting. Why mess up a great thing where you are holding and profiting on millions in deposits? It makes no business sense, it will never make business sense if the goal of business is to exploit and profit. Unless hacks becomes so common as to destroy trust in existing custodial solutions they won't risk the changes.

I appreciate where you are coming from, but have you considered that if there is any of those three things: Overwhelming node connectivity, collaborating with miners, or being the miners - that bitcoin already has much worse problems than quantum computers? I agree that if those three things happen the entire decentralized security model is broken. The thing is they aren't going to magically just happen. In fact their likelihood of coming to unmitigated fruition is incredibly small.
However since they are remote possibilities lets examine them. There are many incentive models in play including attacks on pools that grow more effective as the pool also grows which inherently disincentive the uncontrolled centralization of miners. If miners somehow managed to collaborate in a destructive way, or if a hostile entity ever became the dominant miner of bitcoin then we have some very nice options. For example, we know any hostile miner of 51%&lt; hash power is going to double spend on blocks they mine. As soon as such happens, protocol malleability is what will save us. We, the remaining developers and miners not hostile to the network, are able to effectively ignore any blocks coming from this new mining powerhouse - forking the network and isolating the hostile entity. Obviously such an attack would cause issues for the network in forking efficiently but those would be the limits of the disaster. Any "victims" would return to the fork chain to find their coins intact, while the perpetrator of the attack would have spent an immense amount of money on hardware that is now running a private sidechain with 100% of the hashrate.
So lets just be clear, there are existing pressures in place to combat these situations occurring - financial incentives including risks of enormous losses in hardware and opportunity costs of not mining on the blockchain honestly, malicious pressures including hostile miners attacking pools, and peer pressures including the outrage coming from people like you.
Finally, if the unthinkable occurs and any of the non-quantum things you discuss happened despite these pressures we still have protocol malleability. Protocol malleability is what will define the decentralized security model - the ability to react to and exclude threats.
These concerns are all unrelated to quantum computing however. I don't think you should have conflated the two subjects.

To park my money in the market is as much a gamble as is Bitcoin at this point, except I have significantly more control over my Bitcoin. Why would I put my savings in bonds or CD's? It effectively makes them illiquid. My BTC is as liquid as I need it to be at a moments notice and I don't need to trust anyone else when considering its future value or security.

I feel if there is going to be a fork it should be done by those people who desire properties which do not exist on the current chain and cannot be achieved by soft fork - i.e. if you support 8mb blocks go fork yourself. Forking should be done carefully and preferably with the participation of both sides of the fork engaging on technical issues like replay protection. I don't want BIP148 because it puts political opponents to segwit in a position to fork or concede. This seems like an attack on dissident miners and I do not believe that is yet appropriate. As you've said, bitcoin is working. There isn't a need for such severe action.

Using a given compiler and language specification for completing decentralized tasks that is already widely adopted will be amazing for adoption, and it doesn't mean solidity or the ethereum foundation have any sway over the rootstock compiler, which will inevitably diverge.
Have you read any of the RSK white papers? They are really interesting reads and lay out the strategy for creating a first federated then increasingly decentralized Bitcoin pegged sidechain for SBTC, they describe the many improvements in blockchain structure over proposals like Ethereum such as disposable block data and using Bitcoins decentralization and merge mining. Lumino as well looks exceptionally interesting. The papers lay out their case compellingly at  scroll to the near bottom.
In sum:
1. RSK is more scalable and space efficient than ETH.
2. RSK contracts run on Bitcoin.
3. Any valid ETH contract is currently runnable on RSK.
4. As RSK or ETH diverges from the current version compatibility will be lost. Both ETH and RSK are following an independent path in a unique environment with independent goals. The current compatibility is a useful bootstrap.
5. RSK is currently a federated peg to BTC by a large group of Bitcoin companies and miners. This makes it relatively centralized at launch.
6. Once the BTC BIP 118 SIGHASH_NOINPUT gets adopted the federated peg can become an SPV proof peg (someone correct me with the type of peg if that's wrong -edit: it's not wrong.), which is much more decentralized.

Unless they control a majority of the miners and mine the majority of the blocks, they lose money. Really so long as they don't mine every block they are losing some part of their investment. If they control a majority of the miners we have bigger problems and there are easier and less risky attacks to execute. At what point does their enhanced fee income become worth whatever they are missing from blocks they don't mine? I'm not sure, but it seems like a hell of a gamble compared to other attacks. With even only 30% of the miners of BTC you could execute a double spend attack on any BCH accepting exchange, tank the price, and make fortunes on shorts. This attack you're hypothesizing requires significantly more miner resources, the trust and collaboration of pools - some of which will lose money, and the perpetual maintenance cost of raising fees. I'm not saying it's impossible but if the goal is to abuse the ecosystem for cash there seem like more profitable and reliable ways.

Much as miners choose not to mine for pools that are approaching a majority out of self preservation, we must choose not to pursue relationships with companies that harm our ecosystem out of self preservation. Companies will always attempt to expand and exert influence, however we have the capacity to keep that in check as consumers. Just as consumer boycotts affect traditional companies, they will affect crypto-companies.

If you're securing hundreds of thousands or more in assets by holding a private key under your mattress you deserve what you get. That is not a very responsible way to be your own bank.


Because you aren't thinking of digital assets. it's called liquid because it exists primarily to create liquidity between exchanges and other high volume financial entities.

Why is Bitcoin valuable? Its unique security model. Part of that security model includes tens of thousands of node operators and billions of dollars in mining equipment. Even if you brought an overwhelming number of nodes and miners to have full control of the Bitcoin ecosystem the remaining ecosystem which finds this abhorrent would simply fork off.
Our economy, our user base, our miners, our nodes, our developers. We are all what make Bitcoin, Bitcoin. If we feel threatened we will simply cut you out of our decentralized club. If the miners threaten us we will change PoW algorithms. If the nodes don't follow consensus we blacklist misbehaving nodes. We have many mechanisms to do this and talk about it frequently, in fact PoW change is luke jrs favorite thing and I don't really blame him.
We've even seen this plan in action when BCH forked for a mix of ideological differences and fabricated pretext of attack. You won't ever stop Bitcoin and the people who know it is possible to come to a decentralized consensus from doing just that.
So bring on Facebookcoin. Or Fedcoin. Or any thousands of altcoins. The Nash Equilibrium securing Bitcoin will keep us safe, and should it fail we have contingencies. Without a decentralized security model backing these challengers they will be a joke of a blockchain and worth nothing to anyone here.

I think you are misunderstanding. By your own description addresses are usable once and once alone before being compromised. 


That's what i am saying, and while it may be a reduced functionality to what you are used to it is still a functional bitcoin implementation. That's the worst case, protocol unmalleable situation and it's not the end of the world. Fortunately we have the option to move the bitcoin protocol to a quantum resistant algorithm at our leisure as our protocol is quite malleable.
So what I am saying is your alarm is largely misplaced. The scenario you describe can be avoided entirely with the protocol rules and algorithms in place as is, let alone our ability to change the protocol rules.

I've thought of a question for you:
Imagine there is a sudden and organized economic attack on miners using the current bitcoin protocol implementation. I understand that ideally the best measures to stop such a scenario are preventative, but lets assume it can't be prevented. What is in your opinion the most effective way to limit the impact of the economic attacker and their hostage miners from the node's perspective?
How viable would defenses that nodes can utilize such as changing the PoW algorithm or implementing whitelists/blacklists be in stopping an attack on the user base by hostile miners? Essentially hostile hard forks as a reactionary defensive mechanism in extreme circumstance.

Majority of node support, but I'm talking about the economic security of miners. Do we also have the majority of miner support? I thought the whole reason we were even considering a UASF is because we don't have a majority of miners support.
My concern is that without a majority of miners you are committing us to be attacked by the majority of miners (as this BIP would be considered an attack from their perspective). That would put us irrevocably towards the road of PoW change. I would very much like to  support this BIP as I stand firmly behind segwit, but I find myself leaning towards gmaxwells view of the situation. What I am understanding sounds incredibly risky.

He isn't entirely wrong. There is an incentive mechanism in place not to be caught colluding or having over 50% the hashrate or behave as a dishonest miner regardless of blocksize.

@_date: 2015-10-28 16:37:17
I don't understand why you don't see the absurdity of this idea. Why mine at all if you don't want a scaling economic proof of security? The exact same goals can be met without mining, give your centralized buddies a K of N key or transaction signing key instead. The idea you describe has no technical merit over other solutions and betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how blockchain write permissions and mining work together.
Like I said, your arguments simply do not stand on their own merit. They sound like you have a incomplete understanding of the technical mechanisms that give a blockchain or any other database permissions. You are proposing systems which, just like these private blockchains, needlessly jump through convoluted hoops to achieve what is direct and simple in other software stacks. How is what you describe a reason to use a private blockchain?
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:39:15
I appreciate your time and response, I'll give it serious consideration. What you're proposing is very serious and one of the networks last resort security mechanisms. I view the possibility of PoW change similar to amputation, cutting off the very necessary limb for the sake of the body. I would only consider it in the most severe of circumstance such as an active attack. You're claiming that's what's happening so I suppose it's worth at least considering.
When I say "economic security of miners" I'm referring to the cost to buy a total of 51% of the miners on the chain. Any PoW switch will necessarily sacrifice our current economic security for another.

Surely gold mining and deposit surveying mechanisms have evolved substantially from the days of panning for gold, there's nothing specific about ore extraction which has exempted it from massive gains in technology and technique we have seen applied to industry globally in the last 100 years. Even if gold hasn't kept up in terms of positive value delta of human productivity I don't see how gold and gold backed currencies are a good example of a deflationary currency. 
I think Bitcoin and the idea of a nationless extrajudicial algorithmic monetary supply is very unique and unexplored. It isn't a replacement for inflationary currencies and economic management. Not to get too far sighted by looking at next century, but if bitcoin turns out to sap enough economic force from global economies that it demands action then the best choice for global actors will be to interface their economies as layers on top of bitcoin, which is pretty much end game conditions if everything goes well.

Businesses operating in multiple currencies or ordering inventory internationally are benefited by knowing the value of their currency holdings will not radically change relative to the value of their debts or inventory. I don't think that's possibly disputable. It has nothing to do with price controls, their usefulness or efficiency.

I'm a staunch egalitarian, but I'm also a computer scientist. I know the major innovation here is decentralized economic security. You can't have that without the mining arms race. A basic income coin cannot inherently work since POS (the only algorithm I've ever seen used on a "marxcoin") is uncompetitive from a security standpoint. POW requires an increasing cost to invest, favoring early adoption and resulting in very poor coin distribution, but until someone can fix POS to have a much much higher financial barrier of attack then POW is the only answer to decentralised economic security

There is no doubt whatever they have planned will both work and be superior to what they have now. I do doubt that a blockchain is the appropriate tool in this use case scenario. Either established technologies or a "private blockchain" could be used to accomplish the same desired features. If we can agree on those things, why can't we agree that private blockchains don't make any sense? They fill a role already filled and don't pose a clear advantage - strictly as a technology.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:01:11
I completely agree, those are the objective technical facts. Blockchain has merit *because* it is the most inefficient redundant economically secured database in the world and I know everyone, myself included, has long cautioned that fees would come eventually. Blockspace must be finite.
But people are imperfect. They don't know who to listen to. They are primarily making judgement based on appeals to authority. We're all human. Since the humans in this protocol and in the political space are one of the largest risk factors I wish we could focus on that kind of harm reduction, the kind by making minor technical sacrifices that alone are entirely illogical for the sake of political compromises and reducing the likelihood of an attack by a mass of our peers.
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:46:22
I think you've finally got it. It's not that a private blockchain won't work - it's just a very inefficient re-inventing of a 20 year old wheel. It doesn't have any inherent advantages over existing technology, so why bother? Just implement the well understood, cheaper technology.

The biggest issues I have with Liquid are the black box pre selected company transaction signers and the hard protocol restrictions. Those two limitations create centralization and inflexibility that shouldn't exist in decentralised security - it breaks the security model of any blockchain to do that let alone a no-mine sidechain where transaction signing is the entire security of your chain.

I outlined my primary reason in [this comment](
1. It costs more to develop when the pool of experts to draw from is smaller.
2. Proof of work/stake is a more expensive permission mechanism than any other data store employs and is unnecessary in a centrally controlled environment. 
3. Blockchains are worse in every metric by which modern databases compete such as cpu and memory usage, and transactions per second.
4. Scaling infrastructure is more efficient and better understood in traditional technologies, with existing infrastructure assembled to take advantage of existing traditional technologies.

@_date: 2015-10-28 03:16:17
And you cannot accomplish that with a much more efficient distributed traditional database with a keypair based permission scheme because...?
Of course using a blockchain is better than the current ACH setup in North America - but it's also archaic. A proper database system using telegrams as the communications layer would also be better than the ACH system so it's not saying much. Why is a blockchain better than traditional software solutions for this use case? There is no metric I can imagine in which you would favor a private blockchain to other database technologies when designing a replacement for a banking or settlement system. Can you give me a specific, technical reason to prefer blockchains as a private database solution? The things you describe in your comment as reasons for a private blockchain are easier to accomplish in traditional software than to force on a blockchain so it's difficult for me to see your point.
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:57:44
Sure. My point is more that an immutable datastore != a blockchain.


I'd call it an immutable data store, not a blockchain. Blockchains by any definition imply a protocol based permission mechanism. I.E. mining/staking/whatever. In a private "blockchain" these mechanisms become unneccasary and have to be creatively discarded or reworked - making them completely inefficient and identically funcitonal to traditional software. Private blockchains should instead be developed as traditional software that has similar properties to a blockchain, but in reality function very dissimilar.

@_date: 2015-10-15 17:02:00
That's almost the kicker. You could do all the things that Liquid aspires to do, maybe with only psuedo anonymous privacy - on a public decentralized blockchain or side chain but it's harder for a centralized entity to profit off creating it. Why have the centralized diet version of coke when I can have coke classic - because someone who isn't me wants to make money? Someone will eventually build a decentralized model similar to Liquid. I see this as a very expensive stop gap - not unlike Ripple.

I'm curious if you appreciate the technical, not ideological, reasons why the blockchain is revolutionary. It's the worlds first and most secure permissionless ledger. To create the kind of blockchain you and many in your industry describe has no benefit over a modern private software network not using a blockchain.
Why are you so focused on adopting a technology which will increase your traditional software development and operational costs while removing all benefits and innovation that technology yields? Wouldn't your time be better spent pursuing modern non-blockchain based database solutions where the benefits you seek such as regulation and safety are inherently in your own hands?

I think what people are referring to is the financial pressure on several use cases because of the high fees. It has made use cases like high frequency banking for the worlds poor untenable, microtransactions not cost effective, it has made business models that require low value blockspace unprofitable.

I must be misunderstanding something. The worst case scenario - for BIP148 supporters - seems mild outside potential price chaos. But the worst case scenario being forced on political opponents to BIP148 is as severe as any worst-case contentious hardfork. Do you feel it's appropriate for the minority of a community to risk so much of the whole? Why would it be unfair for me to characterize such actions by the minority as an attack on the majority?
Edit: Having read your other comments it actually seems like the risk to BIP148 supporters is significant if they remain a minority. The majority chain can attack the minority chain at whim, and [your proposed defense]( to that is a PoW change. How are these risks acceptable? You are talking about potentially removing us from the economic backing of our economic security model. They won't join the minority chain for fear of invalidating their own, they will have a fork to stop reorgs before they will join the chain which is threatening their existence and which they politically disagree with. This seems like a terribly irresponsible way to move forward.

If the rules are similar to bitcoin consensus, don't you lose all of your decentralized advantages by having your blockchain parsed and appended by a select few companies? It seems to my (mis)understanding that if the K of N signature scheme sees K parties fail or otherwise experience an attack or legal obstruction or internal fraud anything which may impede operating service for the remainder of N - it would be wise to have K be as large a number as possible. 
When you talk about this anonymous black box for signing transactions with a consensus that is apparently too fragile and important to be reviewed or left in human hands, I am really concerned you do not understand the security model of bitcoin. By intentionally restricting and controlling the points of signing you have created centralized security and a central point for failure. Even if your K is several hundred companies, by both making the rules for consensus absolute and and pre-selecting who gets to run a node you are introducing multiple attack vectors that don't exist in properly decentralized blockchains.
Could you maybe explain a little bit about why your security model is not affected by the reduced decentralization and restrictive protocol rules you have applied here? What makes this different than a K of N write access shared database - the "anonymity"?

Yes, some do. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what they want though or the results of any referendum. Users frustrated that blockspace is finite can't change the realities of node distribution or the regional incentives of delayed block propagation. If they want to fork their holdings into an alt coin who are we to stop them? It's only when they threaten the existence of a bitcoin which does maintain properties of trust and decentralization that I become gravely concerned, and those are the kinds of risks I see from actions like the UASF which "forces" nodes and miners with political difference to fork instead of allowing them to do so responsibly and of their own accord. It blatantly risks miner retaliation and leads us down a rabbit hole of potentially having to defend ourselves with a PoW change that I don't even want to touch.
If the community can avoid either of these diametrically opposed sides waging war with every tool available to them *and* there continues to be a bitcoin with strong decentralized properties I will have considered it a day won. There are certain sacrifices I would be willing to accept so long as there continues to be a compelling argument that bitcoin maintains strong decentralized properties and will continue to in the future.
I don't want to have a philosophical debate with people who can only see the world through a philosophical lens, I just want to move forward with the lowest amount of risk possible. If they feel strongly enough about their principles let there be an amicable fork.

I mean, technically since transaction signing is the black box server Liquid is very centralized much like ripple without the tokens. The protocol itself is also centrally controlled according to the core tech at blockstream - there are no forks they conceptually aren't a thing because there is no consensus. It's maybe conceptually better than ripple but it's not what it could or should be, which is public and decentralized with a malleable protocol. The public security model is simply superior to the private one by every metric. That doesn't mean private is totally unacceptable, most systems are private, but in the future I would like our clearing houses to run public blockchains and transaction signing to be decentralized.

They have accepted for now the new technology but they view the fight as not over. They are threatening to split off into their own coin called bitcoin cash in a few months. They are already marketing it as the true and original vision for bitcoin and this non-existent coin has started to be traded on the futures market just today. It's debuted with something like 10% the value of bitcoin and no liquidity the last time I looked.
There is a lot of technical illiteracy in the group supporting bitcoin cash. Many honestly believe the recent segwit upgrade will destroy bitcoin despite no technical background or facts to reenforce that view. Their view is that protocol upgrades are political, not technical, and their political views have been informed by the propoganda of these mining cartels. They believe the bitcoin developers are an organized group of paid corporate interest liars who are pushing upgrades that go against bitcoins principles and will ultimately destroy it.
Bitcoin attracts a certain kind of fringe conspiracy theorizing lunatic, and of that demographic a significant percentage support bitcoin cash. A significant percentage supports bitcoin too, but of the bitcoin demographics these are the people most likely to be swayed by the mining cartel. Cartel is a bit of a misnomer, its really just one company.

I'm sorry but what you describe is not a justification for the use case of a private blockchain, it is instead the justification for a distributed K of N append only database system.


This is the EXACT situation you are putting yourself in even with your private blockchain and the reason it is not superior to a distributed K of N append only traditional database system.
You have correctly identified the weakness in traditional distributed database systems that bitcoin solves - why don't you understand that you have exposed yourself to the same vulnerability?
You're right internal networks are supremely useful, but there are much superior backbone technologies to accomplish all the goals you describe than a blockchain. 
Proper key pair cryptography paired with a distributed K of N database is exactly what your use case calls for. It's cheaper to run, faster to search, easier to compress and store, easier to hire professionals for, and a better understood internal security environment for all involved.
I would like you to explain for me one use case in which your private blockchain out performs the distributed system I describe in analog to Liquid.

It's not hard to rationalize an evidence based position.
Evidence: Public blockchains are the first decentralized and secure public database layer to exist. They accomplish this at the expense of being grossly inefficient and using economic security (hashing) in place of cryptographic security.
Evidence: Private blockchains have a private security model, and thus are not secured through decentralization. They rely on cryptographic security which is centrally controlled just like traditional software - not economic security. They are also just as inefficient as public blockchains. Private blockchains have all the attributes of traditional software and none of the advantages of public blockchains.
Evidence: Traditional software models possess immutability, public key cryptography, and failure resistant distribution models. They are much better understood than blockchains and have been around longer than blockchains have existed.
Conclusion: Private blockchains offer no advantages over traditional software solutions. Public blockchains have clear advantages and disadvantages to private software and thus there are some use cases where public blockchains are a superior database layer to traditional database software.

You are wrong then. It is absolutely possible to default on a bitcoin mortgage, bitcoin insurance program, bitcoin loan or any other financial tool where defaulting is possible. It is possible to be defrauded, through fault or not. As I have said repeatedly, removing central failure eliminates one kind of insurance requirement for bitcoin but has no influence on other insurance requirements for other contexts. Reread my first post in this chain.
If "all you are saying" is that bitcoin doesn't need a central authority I wouldn't feel the need to put you in your place.

You're appealing to their authority in finance to support their position on a new storage layer technology. Don't do that. Instead make a decision based on the merits of the arguments provided.
The primary reason private blockchains are a silly idea is they pose no fundamental advantage over other storage layer solutions. By centralizing protocol malleability or transaction signing or mining or node operation you've ruined the decentralized public security model - which is the only reason anyone bothers with the otherwise wasteful concept of proof of work. A private, centrally controlled blockchain is functionally no different from any other technology stack accomplishing the same objectives except -
1. Blockchain technology is more expensive to develop and maintain than traditional technologies since there are fewer professionals with experience - and 
2. Blockchain technology involves proof of work which is inherently less efficient than any other database storage layers write or permission mechanisms by a large order of magnitude.
By making a blockchain private you have destroyed the decentralized security that makes the blockchain an innovative storage layer solution. A blockchain without a decentralized security model is essentially a very inefficient and expensive to develop append only database.
A public blockchain protocol on the other hand is able to fork or change without authority and independent of the success or failures of any group. A public blockchain can resist censorship and cross international boundaries in ways no other technology stack can. There are definitive use case advantages to storing data on a public blockchain versus traditional software solutions. What are the use cases for storing data on a private blockchain instead of a distributed, key based permission database?

Wouldn't you be able to identify malicious miners in a 51% attack by their inclusion of non-standard transactions that standard node software would have included? Essentially I am proposing that one extreme measures defense at the nodes disposal could be to formalize transaction inclusion logic and ignore any chain not conforming to transaction inclusion rules. I'm interested in if you feel this would be effective.
I'm also interested in how viable a defense changing the PoW algorithm would be, which isn't affected by anonymity and would force the attacker to regain a new mining majority on the new algorithm - buying time to pursue a more significant solution if nothing else.
Do you see these as viable defensive options or is a rebalancing of the incentive model the only preventitive measure you can think to stop an in progress 51% attack?

My mistake, sorry. Either way I appreciate your thoughts and input in helping me wrap my head round why someone thinks this is a good idea.
I honestly would rather see a 1:1 public ledger side chain peg instead of an entirely privately run system for bitcoin markets. They exist in a decentralized system and are high risk entities, I'd like to see them secured by the entire community instead of relying on their peers or obfuscation or a single company. The system we describe above in Liquid I much favor for traditional industry, something to replace the old wire transfer systems and database syncing that we currently do.

It's terrifying to me that you're intentionally attacking the majority knowing full well they will retaliate so you have justification for the PoW change you've always wanted.

I think that the justifications for the UASF aren't as solid as supporters state, nor the risks as minor.
UASF is justified because Bitcoin is under attack. That's the argument. Whether you feel that the attack of not supporting your favorite scaling solution is actually an attack or not (by this definition any prolonged  political disagreement is an attack), BIP148 proposes responding with the full defensive capacity of the nodes on the network. The kind of defensive capacity which forces your political opponents to hard fork and risks the majority of miners wrath as response. I see BIP 148 as a call to war, a threat that the miners will either get in line or the full defensive capacity of the network will be felt.
So I have to ask BIP148 supporters, is the "attack" we are experiencing proportional to our response? No, it doesn't seem so at all. We are emptying every response option we have. I ask BIP 148 supporters, is the notion of miner retaliation really risk free? I say no, it's not. Some of the statements floating around about how entirely risk free this BIP is are disingenuous, from a perspective where ultimately fighting the miners and changing PoW is a good thing. Saying there are no risks is not a fair accounting of the risks. BIP 148 is a declaration of war.
I hope most of us can agree that political disagreement about the scaling solution to take is not an attack worth risking a PoW change over. I do support segwit, I can't support this BIP. If this BIP made any kind of effort at all to avoid reorgs for non supporters I would reconsider, but as is it is clearly an attack on those who politically disagree instead of a fork for those who politically agree. It should be the latter not the former.

It's not a lie, it's subject to terms and limitations you may not like but these insurances exist and are the norm - and if you're so short sighted to believe there aren't contexts in which bitcoin or other crypto could be beneficially guaranteed or insured you obviously don't understand the limitations of the "assurance" that is proof of work. I doesn't guarantee you many things, like that the cryptocurrency comes from a legal source which could be important to some people, or guard you against your own dumb mistakes like falling for a scam. Some people and businesses will want those assurances, so get off your ideological high horse and realize that allowing people to use bitcoin the way they are used to using fiat doesn't limit your uses of bitcoin, it only expands its value.

I understand that you have your own arbitrary lines in the sand between what you are doing and malicious, but you don't seem to understand the way language works.


Those are your ethics, you're saying their attack is worse than BIP 148s attack - but that isn't an argument hat BIP 148 isn't an attack.
You can't project your definitions and ethics on the world. You should accept that if everyone campaigns like BIP 148 is an attack "liberating" bitcoin from the tyranny of miners, that if the miners perceive it as an attack, and that if the miners respond to it with attacks explicitly justifying those attacks as defensive against BIP 148's attack - that the universally accepted situation is that BIP 148 is an attack. If you want to call it something else, fine, but it's still functioning as an attack.
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and everyone is exclaiming it's a duck except a couple people of little significance - it's a duck
Understand now? Language is defined by usage, not your internal logical structures and justifications.

As I have now explained in four of these threads, Liquid is not backed in any way by the bitcoin blockchain. It is a traditional and centralized K of N append only shared database using the bitcoin blockchain as a storage layer. It has zero advantages over non-blockchain technology since it does not make use of dencentralized security which is the primary innovation of the blockchain. Liquid has a non malleable, black box protocol controlled by a singular entity. It is a fancy system I will give you that but I see nothing innovative here - not innovative using cryptocurrency anyways.

I think that would be pretty neat. Any immutable ledger can be described as a chain.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:07:56
I'm not excluding the possibility - but that would be remarkable if accurate. Specifically that there in fact were no higher fee transactions in the mem pool or that substantially lower fee transactions were included before yours. I would be very curious to examine what was occurring if you did in fact witness this.  Any chance we can get a transaction id?

You're clearly not wanting to have a discussion about objective realities - it's not an opinion that a secure decentralized data store requires a unique permissions layer like PoW or PoS, it's a fact. Such things did not exist until the original blockchain. You cannot take that unique permissions layer away or replace it with another and maintain the "secure decentralized" part of your protocol.
In your imagination you assign single votes to keys with no authority on who generates keys and a majority of keys vote about protocol malleability. How does this not result in a key generation race - owner of the most keys controls the network? Creating a permissions protocol is incredibly tricky - you won't create a cryptographic one, even bitcoin isn't a cryptographicacly secured blockchain. It's economic security, hence the mining. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 05:32:27
1. What about a private blockchain implies a public mempool? Example: Liquid will not have a public mempool despite being a private blockchain.
2. Immutability is not a feature which was pioneered by or is explicit to bitcoin. It exists quite naturally in other software environments and has for a long time.
3. I don't even know what you're saying or how the same "robust consistency" isn't available to traditional distributed databases. Because immutability isn't only available on blockchains you can achieve the same "robust consistency" that immutability implies.
4. Transactional accountability is only available to the people with database access - in a private blockchain which is by definition private this is the same people as it would be in traditional private software. So again, zero benefit over traditional software development as transaction records can be made equally public or private by the same central authority in both instances regardless of blockchain technology. Example: All the open data you already see in the world.
5. I completely agree with this point. I agree with avoiding overly complex protocols that don't suit the task at hand so much that I oppose the use of blockchains when more obvious and simple solutions are present. Thank you for making my point for me, because by every definition there is no "simple" blockchain protocol where as there are significantly well understood database technologies currently in use by industry professionals.
5. You know why synchronization is an issue? Because you're using a blockchain when you shouldn't be.
6. This is an inherent property of scaling infrastructure as is, and the knowledge of how various database technologies do scale with infrastructure is much better understood than how blockchain technologies scale with infrastructure.
7. You do not have byzantine fault resilience on a private blockchain. By preselecting the "nodes" or "miners" or any of the other many variables that break the decentralized security model you are introducing trust, which is the opposite of Byzantine fault resilience.
I would challenge you to demonstrate that a centralized blockchain is a common cryptographic structure "in reality" or list a more coherent variety of reasons. If the main advantage like you say is being "tamper evident"/immutability - a point you try to make about 3 times in different words - I propose that immutability is a simple process and can be achieved with any  number of industry adopted database solutions. None of the reasons you list here are specific to blockchains or address the inherent inferiority of private blockchains to competing technologies. Why do you think that achieving the features you describe would be so difficult outside of a blockchain? They were possible outside of a blockchain before blockchains were even invented.
A common structure "in reality" is centralized immutable data stores. There is no need for blockchains. I'm not saying private blockchains won't work - they will absolutely work - but it won't provide any benefits over existing software practices and will be incredibly wasteful to develop.

It's sad that you don't understand how this quote applies to you. Some people are emotionally invested, sure, but your arguments do not at all stand on their own merit. 
Just as a small small example of many: You start describing a system with equal hash power "alotted", but fail to comprehend that such a scenario is impossible since no mechanism for alotting hash power exists - hash power is a computations race and nothing stops party A from spending money doing more computations than party B. The idea of alotting hashpower is incoherent with the goals hashing accomplishes and mechanisms by which it operates.
Another example - this one isn't your mistake but keeps being repeated in this thread - mistaking distributed for decentralized. Centralizing even one aspect of the security mechanisms like nodes or transaction signing or protocol malleability makes the whole concept centralized because it gives the private blockchain a central point of authority and failure. Centralizing one metric of security invalidates the decentralized nature of the blockchain and makes it simply distributed, like typical software is.
Just be open to the idea that you don't know what you are talking about.

Yes, some users are revoking control. Correct or not, this will provoke the miners to potentially attack us for forcing them to hard fork. That's a risk that isn't being discussed. If that happens our only real defense is PoW change, which is an enormous concession for us to have to make. Losing our existing population of miners greatly affects the cost of a 51% type attack and will likely affect centralization.
Is this really an appropriate action to take when we could just fork responsibly? If it has become as bad as some people think we could do an actual fork and leave two viable chains if we wanted, with the malicious miners going one way and the rest of us another. This also cripples the new chains economic security, but at least isn't doing it in such a way as to assure a retaliatory attack.
I don't think it's as bad as all that yet. I think the "attack" of not passing segwit is exaggerated in its maliciousness and affect on the security model. It doesn't require such an extreme response yet.
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:54:13
So you concede point 1 but say it doesn't matter. It does. No one wants to pay more for something than they need to. We call those rational actors.
There seems to be a serious misunderstanding about 2. We're saying the same thing - private "blockchains" or database solutions don't need a permissions protocol. We both agree on that. If they aren't needed - why start off working with a system in which they are fundamental instead of a blank slate? Just use a database and create a permissions layer on top of it that reflects your needs.
Well, 3 was a trap - it's impossible to create a blockchain that is superior to modern data store technologies because any blockchain is inherently built on top of modern data store technologies. What makes a blockchain different from a distributed database and a few protocol rules? NOTHING! That's all it is! Surely you aren't calling every database and protocol based permission layer a blockchain are you? They've been around a long while, before the word blockchain existed. So what makes a blockchain unique from traditional data store models are the kind of protocol rules it uses for permission. There is literally no other difference. Because trust isn't as big an issue in the use case we're describing for these private blockchains, non-blockchain technologies can take advantage of the networks distributive power by trusting one another. There are a plethora of optimizations which severely reduce the fingerprint of the computational overhead that is "blockchain protocol" by eliminating trust. But at the end of the day you're left with a modern database, and a few protocol rules which have no similarity to any other definition of the word blockchain, but does have immense similarity (read: identical) to traditional software solutions.
and 4 - a blockchain that actually has no central point of authority but can be governed by the users themselves is a public blockchain and must incorporate a mechanism to create trust between users, define who is or isn't a user, and so forth. That's a public blockchain and it would require some sort of proof of work or permission mechanism that enabled trust. How can you have no central authority without compromising your position on point

They aren't as far removed as you exaggerate. Are you suggesting the better course is to have no estimate because the error is too high?
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:28:22
It's many different kinds of immutability, including what bitcoin provides.
When you talk about bitcoin you are no longer talking about just immutability, it's consensus through PoW, and yes the blockchain did invent that. Private blockchains strip the consensus features, which is why comparisons to traditional immutable techniques are favorable instead of comparing them to blockchains which have a wholly unique permissions layer.

I completely agree. Now we're talking the same language. I feel the response you have received here has a lot to do with the fact that it's not obvious to us that you're not looking to make a blockchain at all. You want to build (or rather have built) your own database software and blackbox access points to store your cryptography.
Since you're the first to note that it has essentially nothing to do with bitcoin. why are you here? Why are you marketing so heavily as side chains and related to bitcoin technology? This seems like you're trying to give the impression in public that you posses similar technological innovations or security measures as those on other blockchains and are bringing them to institutional clients with your software.
Especially when you respond to comments suggesting that your solution has advantages over traditional distributed solutions in regards to environment security or centralization. That makes it sound like you are ignorant to the centralization you have applied to your protocol but you clearly aren't - what you mean is that your block boxes are the environmental innovation. You want your company to take over essentially the role of internal database security by obfuscating and simplifying it. That's cool, but has nothing to do with bitcoin or blockchains and is leading to a lot of confusion, at least it did for me.

He's talking about insurance and regulation. It's not insured or regulated the way most fiat deposits are. That's the guarantee. And that's true, because bitcoin isn't a fiat centrally controlled currency there is no need to insure against the possibility that the central authority fails. There might be other kinds of insurance or guarantees you might want for bitcoin depending on your context such as insurance against theft or fraud, or a guarantee that the coins you are accepting aren't being laundered through you.

I think those numbers are misleading. It's less about individual branches mining than it is the economics of mining. Many if not most of those branches are under the same corporate banner making them the same mining entity. Also those companies are not equally large or equally successful. Mining is an economics arms race, the larger companies will form the majority of the mining power. We already see similar things happening in public blockchains, a blockchain just for say north american banks amplifies this problem. And that's assuming you can convince banks to spend an immense amount on miners, electricity, and staff in the first place. I think these are the reasons we see most private blockchains discard PoW.

"plenty of time to prepare to not follow 148 safely" == hard fork. Why not do the preparation to avoid risk in BIP 148 itself? Because exposing the would-be "legacy" chain to risk is entirely the intention. It forces BIP 148 opponents to act instead of BIP 148 proponents acting themselves. How is that not coercion?

You're describing a lot of public attributes, where's the private ones? Also, what stops malicious key holders who get selected from submitting false transaction data?

Revoking keys isn't a useful strategy for purging a immutable ledger. And what you are describing may not be a perfectly public blockchain, but it is public by every metric I can think of. Just needs PoW or another securing mechanism against bad actors.
In fact I really think you should drop your "it's not a public blockchain" opposition or whatever this silly debate is and go out to make your quasi-public key based vote coin. I think it sounds pretty good. Just be sure to include PoW to combat bad actors. And a tokanization for paying your infrastructure and protocol costs. You simply need those things unless you want to centralize transaction signing. And if you do want to centralize transaction signing (here we go again) you might as well just build a traditional software solution in the first place because that's what they all do.

You can go to a bitcoin exchange, use bitcoin to buy $100 USD, and withdraw to any account. What exactly is the difference between using a foreign currency and a bank to buy and then send USD versus using a bitcoin bank to use bitcoin to buy and then send USD? In every one of these instances you list are transmitting USD bought with a foreign currency.
What you're complaining about is that transmitting bitcoin isn't the same as all of those other use cases and it should be, when all those other use cases are transmitting USD. If you were paying people in swiss francs and waiting for it to clear the clearing houses only to expect your receiver to then buy USD with the sent francs weeks after you sent it, you wouldn't be getting the same value of USD either. That's not quite an analog to what you're doing. You're using your Mexican pesos to buy swiss francs, transmitting swiss franks to your receiver at some point in the future, who then has to buy USD with it.
You're telling me that's not absurd on its face? You're telling me that's not you projecting your misunderstanding about how currency works when you then complain on a popular swiss monetary discussion forum that swiss francs don't even do their job and aren't money?

You want to know why my tone is impatient? It's because you don't understand and I can't make you understand. Sending bitcoin, sending gold, sending fiat - that is sending a fixed value in each of those terms. 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin, 1 ounce of gold is 1 ounce of gold, 1 USD is 1 USD. You can't reasonably have expectations about what the buying power of your unit of value is going to be in a given place on the globe at a given time. That's absurd.
If you want to transmit value over a medium with less volatility in its conversion to another unit of value, don't choose bitcoin. It couldn't be simpler.

The fact that you don't see why this introduces reliance on your services/hosts security re-enforces my opinion that you shouldn't be serving live code to generate keys for people, even if the key is eventually generated locally. Is there a way to do it safely? Yeah, but you're introducing problems that shouldn't be there in the first place.

When that persuasion is by means of force or threats it is exactly coercion. I again insist, if there is an entity who has undergone economic embargo and not considered it force or threat with intent to persuade I'd love to hear that anecdote. There's a pretty rich history for example of the US banking system black balling banking systems which don't conform to their whims which seems to fit the definition of economic embargo pretty nicely. Is that not coercion?

There is a reason rates are so high, most lenders have pulled out. You take the risk with the reward. There is never just reward. If you see reward, look for risk.

Treating crypto like a get rich scheme is the best way to lose money doing it. If you do achieve your goal of spending very little and earning low risk bitcoins I would suggest luck was the dominant factor.
Mining is just buying coins the long way around and historically investors have done better than miners on a per dollar basis.
If you are looking to introduce risk to your coin in exchange for their increased value, go trade leveraged contracts at bitmex. There you actually stand a chance of getting yourself rich, though like any of these risks you'll probably lose it all first. At least with leveraged trading you can tailer your risk and reward, when you are lending you are at the mercy of the rates.

The benefits of being able to trade immediately and earn interest seem great, but make sure you really understand the risks. A disturbing percentage of users have been impacted by exchange fraud or security issues. I've lost ~6k myself and had a ton of near misses where my money escaped within days of disaster. Mintpal, Cryptsy, MtGox, Bitfinex - all nearly lost everything. Be very very careful and very very paranoid when you are not the one who controls your coins. It is the wild west out here.

Is it simpler to believe that the market is reacting positively to something that might happen in the future, or something that is actually happening now? Your explaination of the market is unnecessarily convoluted. What supports your interpretation other than your intuition? The support for segwit being the reason for the price increase regardless of 2x happening is the strong correlation with the probability of segwit locking in increasing and the largest single day gains in bitcoin history, and the fact that BIP 91 does not specify for any future hardforks. Isn't anthing beyond that assumption on your part?

A conservative estimate is required anticipating a plausible unfavourable scenario.

Pretending the signalling and activation of BIP 91 using code that has existed for over a year and been tested extensively by every supporter and critic is some sort of rush job betrays your own ognorance of the software development process and nothing else.

And your anecdote of an economic embargo is someone choosing not to buy shampoo from Israel? You should be aware Israel considers these activist grassroots campaigns antisemitic and lobbies heavily against them.

I am, and I am telling you it's basic common sense. I am so glad the community at large does not make decisions about the future of bitcoin like you suggest. The community is reactionary and quick to act before thinking. It is prone to witch hunts and is easily manipulated into a angry mob.

1. It will still be cheaper to outsource using traditional technologies. Way cheaper.
2. Of course you don't need those permission mechanisms, why are you using a blockchain! Why favor a technology where you have to remove a central component and re-engineer the permissions layer when you can do half the work and just build your permissions layer on top of well understood technologies using age old techniques?
3. Name for me the specifications of a blockchain which will outperform ANY modern database in the fields of transactions per second (actual output) or cumulative hardware expense. There are no properties you can apply to a blockchain that will keep it a blockchain and exceed the performance of modern data stores.
4. There is a central gate keeper on private blockchains. Example: On liquid it's the company that is developing the protocol - they control all transaction signing, node running, and protocol malleability. That's a central gate keeper. Name for me a private blockchain without a central authority.

So you suggest that not all keys are valid keys, only pre approved keys by the majority of pre-existing keys. So who issues pre-existing keys, and how do you protect yourself from bad actors in that selection process or not make that selection process centralized?
As you answer that question, consider how you would accomplish trust in this network without the source code being open. And without mining, who gets to sign and commit the next transaction to the database and decide what that transaction is? You can't commit everything at once or in parallel - it must be ordered.
The more you answer these questions the more what you are describing sounds like a public alt-coin blockchain, doesn't it? What's private about any of what you describe? No central control, publicly verifiable and accessible transaction record, decentralized means of network expansion and inclusion. That's a public blockchain my friend.

It's a very expensive and round about way of getting what we already have. Where is the innovation? Why is this so special if you readily admit it's just a fancy shared private database?

The attack is the risk BIP 148 thrusts upon the network, the attack is on what some miners perceive as their future income potential. There is nothing analogous about an economic embargo and not using a product you used in the past.
This conversation very much echos a point I made earlier: the mental gymnastics required to frame this debate in the terms you have are immense. There is no convincing someone capable of such gymnastics.

You hold bitcoin. You want to lock in a dollar value of your bitcoin for a period of time. You don't want to risk all your bitcoin sitting on exchange.
So you take say 1/5th of your holdings and deposit on a leveraged platform like Bitmex and you short a long term futures product at the total value you want to lock in at with 5x leverage thus creating an order that represents your entire holdings.
If Bitcoin price goes up, you lose Bitcoin but what Bitcoin you have will continue to be equal to the total dollar value you sold them at. If the price goes down, you earn Bitcoin such that your total Bitcoin will be equal to the total dollar value you sold them at. When the futures close and your position is exited you can then decide to lock in the value of your Bitcoin again on another futures contract or not.

What terribly flawed commentary. The first article revolves around a false premise that outrage stopped binance from 51% attacking, when the reality is the difficulty in organizing an attack and the rapidly exploding cost of that attack and the resistance that attack would face from the rest of the security actors of the protocol stopped the attack.

What's stopping them from being holders now? This seems a lot more like a PR campaign than it does a celebration, which is fine and dandy but for the bitcoin holders this doesn't seem like anything we can even participate in. We already control our keys and coins.
I also think the issue isn't one of awareness, everyone who has their coins held on an exchange knows the mantra "Not your keys not your coins". These are people actively choosing to insert middlemen where none belong. Will a PR campaign calling itself a celebration help with that?
I literally just saw another post promoting this "event" and it suggested everyone redeposit their coins the day after the event! Even the people promoting it don't agree what it is set to accomplish. To them it isn't about promoting storing your own keys it is a test run on the exchanges.

I don't understand at all what your problem is. If your issue is "they don't have a chance to withdraw for the amount I want them to!" then deposit directly to an account that auto-converts to fiat. I think this is incredibly stupid in the first place and your concern of "what if I overpay/underpay them" is absurd on its face. You can't use bitcoin to pay someone in fiat. You use bitcoin to pay someone in bitcoin. If your goal is to pay someone in fiat you are using the wrong tool for the job and that is the entirety of the reason for your frustration. The exchange fees and withdrawal/deposit fees  and the buy/sell spread on either end are going to be as bad as any other fee based fiat system, so why are you using bitcoin for this at all if your receivers don't want to receive bitcoin and you don't like the inherent properties of bitcoin?

The entire point of the daily thread is so that low effort content and price discussion can happen there. It's a valuable thread to have that frees up space on the front page as part of combating the very problem we are talking about.

If anything qualified reviewers are in desperate need. Please do contribute.


Bitcoin is not about growth first and foremost, it is about the technology you so eagerly dismiss. Adoption is only relevant in so far as it results in a more secure and stable network. Lightning has plenty of funding with three separate sponsored implementations. Not all problems are a matter of throwing dollars at them.

Microtransactions are best done through layers. Thinking that the base layer should be used for microtransactions is to think that the worlds global decentralized data set secured by billions of dollars in hashpower and a hundred thousand nodes should be for recording transactions for turning the page of a book for all time. It's just incoherent on its face. Those transactions are abstracted so they aren't individually recorded - do that stuff off chain where it is cheap.

That is exactly the thinking. A dollar invested in a national company is more valuable to the country than a dollar not interacting with the economy at all.
It's a balancing between the collective and individual good. Many people in this community feel it errs too far on the side of collective good at the expense of individuals as their uninvested worth erodes, but I think those people ignore the facts that most modern economies pose financial policies which make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Investments have been a fantastic mechanism of not only wealth preservation, but wealth growth and they are only available to those with disposable wealth. These policies have been an enormous boon to individuals at the expense of the whole despite being often criticized for the exact opposite, as individuals bemoan their decaying dollars purchasing power.

I don't know how long coinshares has been around and I try  not to evaluate research by who funded it or performed it, but rather the soundness of its assumptions and reproducibility.  I can reproduce this same conclusion using the same publicly available data, that sways my opinion.
I have no affiliation with this company and had never heard of them outside this and another publication. I was/am simply frustrated that for all the people taking time to comment against the conclusion, none have bothered to read it. In fact the vast majority of these comments are refuted by the paper itself, such as that coal is the largest source of power generation in China - a fact irrelevant to the trapped  renewable curtailment in the highly renewable penetrating (90% penetration) regions where mining is occuring.

Cite for me any soft fork which by design orphans consensus valid blocks. Calling it a soft fork doesn't make it one, it's an attack.
Just like if miners decided to block all blocks that contain a US blacklisted utxo and orphan them. Not a soft fork, that's an attack. Soft forks mechanism of function isn't orphaning all consensus valid blocks that they don't like. That's a 51% attacks mechanism.
A softforks mechanism of function is to define a subset of function within the scope of consensus and enable it,allowing full backwards interoperability and certainly not by design orphaning any currently valid blocks.
Segwit orphans no blocks, my line of reasoning is absolutely not bcahshers line of reasoning. You can publish a block identical in structure to one before August 2017 it is fully backwards compatible as are all soft forks. What you describe is not backwards compatible if those blocks are intentionally orphaned. Orphaning blocks you disagree with by relying on 51% of the hashpower to build a longer chain is a 51% attack .
Edit: This text is incorrect, segwit does orphan any legacy structured block and a 51% can simultaneously be a softfork. I stand corrected.

There are reasons to use legacy addresses, for example preserving the ability to sign messages.
There is no convincing everyone to use one address format, people will do what they want and that's perfectly fine. Every time the blocks get full and the fees get high more people will consider switching or moving off chain but it's their decision not ours.

Pretty backwards though to propose a BIP that makes your federated peg irrelevant, design a system where your federated peg is a stop gap solution at best, then ignore it when you get everything you have specified and been trying for.

It isn't because it reduces GDP, economic growth, and tax base. You need people to spend money to earn sales taxes, you need people to invest money to reduce unemployment and increase payroll taxes and stimulate business development. Money sitting in a bank account is a detriment to a government, they want to use tools like inflation and interest rates to convince you to move it and this is generally to the benefit of the whole citizenry.
Unfortunately like all tools these policies can be misused and abused. Bitcoin creates an offramp from local economies where this has been the case and encourages governments to be responsible and aware of the costs poorly implemented financial policies can have - as if they misstep there is suddenly a readily available alternative economy for citizens to escape to.

Because ethereum is so lacking of the only thing novel in this space - decentralization - that there was a period where running a full node (what they call an archival node) was literally impossible for the amount of resources it took. They have so few nodes controlled by so few parties that they have called off a hardfork with a central decree just moments before it is supposed to launch. They have a scaling plan which literally involves throwing away the entire current blockchain due to unmanageable blockchain bloat over the next ten years - which is exactly why the bitcoin community told them not to structure their blockchain the way they did in the first place all those years ago.
Does etherum make writing contracts simple using standard programming conventions unlike bitcoins stack based scripting? Absolutely, at the expense of security in the form of countless smart contract "hacks" a year that are really just developers who don't know what they are doing because it is so "simple" to mess up turing complete smart contracts. Which is why they immediately abandoned the "code is law" mantra during the DAO in favor of "whatever the etherum foundation wills" is law. If the people who wrote the smart contract language can screw up on such an unbelievable scale as to fork the entire chain to recover funds what are the average developers chances? We see the consequences of that playing out constantly.
Ethereum is exactly what every player in the Bitcoin community warned it would be when we rejected going that direction ourselves and decided to build in layers.
So in answer to your original question - of course using centralized tools for microtransactions is easier. If you want to do that, just use properly centralized tools and not ethereum. Or use off chain solutions which resolve to Bitcoins security model and gain the security and censorship resistance of decentralization. Either way, the answer isn't ethereum.

Imagine a giant flow chart. This is your script, the logical flow you follow to reach a result - in this case a valid bitcoin transaction. When you follow the flow chart you will find that you don't travel through most of it. You run into conditionals forcing you to choose one box or the other in the flow.
Right now you would have to publish the entire script flowchart to send your transaction. It could be big depending on how complicated the flow chart is and big means more expensive transactions.
Taproot + MAST enables you to only need to publish the part of the flow chart you actually travelled through to create your transaction. This makes it much smaller and cheaper.
What specific examples? Any transaction involving a conditional. Lightning channels, multisig, any script you can think to make with your programmable money.

No, that's not how RSK works. As I said three times now, the RSK BIP resolves the multi signature custody issue if ever passed. The federation currently securing that peg isn't also securing the sidechain or forming consensus beyond the peg, that is being done directly by Bitcoin miners. The peg is the only issue, and will be resolved if ever a BIP is passed resolving it. At which point the BIP passes the federation is dissolved.

You are completely wrong. The efficiencies lower the cost of mining, the cost of mining being the defining economic cost in Bitcoins economic security model. To make Bitcoin more efficient whether through the natural progression of mining hardware or through use of a less energy consuming algorithm is to reduce the security of the Bitcoin network. That security is only restored through increased hashrate and energy consumption, which thankfully is exactly what happens as miner hardware improves and old miners are displaced. To have a more efficient algorithm or miners and create the same cost of mining implies similar power usage and hardware costs, which are the principle costs of mining.
It's not wasteful at all and wishing it was more power efficient is analogous to wishing it was less secure. Power usage and economic cost to run the network is entirely the point of the network, it's not a problem to be solved it's a solution to a problem.

Do you really feel that is an appropriate use of the worlds most expensive source of immutability?

It doesn't help the chain, and as others note the big benefit is to yourself, but it does help the network. We need nodes for SPV clients to connect to, we need nodes for other nodes to download blocks from, and we need **independent** node runners acting as security actors keeping miners in line should they stray. On this last point about security, whether you run 4000 nodes or 1 node your impact is the same since you only represent one person's economic activity. A network with 3000 different node runners is more secure than a network with 1 node runner and 4000 nodes. Nodes cannot Sybil attack the network since they can only influence their own consensus. If the 4000 nodes owned by 1 person disagree with the 3000 owned by the rest, the 4000 person is now on a useless network entirely by themselves. They cannot sybil attack, only define their own consensus for themselves.

Again, we are not talking about cryptographic security. There is no trillions of years to hack bitcoin or any need to hack it at all, Bitcoins security is available for purchase. Bitcoin is a distributed ledger whose write permissions are for sale, that's the security model, how much does it cost to assure write permission and deny write permission to others. That cost has many contributing factors, but power cost is important among them.
What makes bitcoin resistant to tampering is 1) it's distributed and you can't hack everyone and 2) the consensus model revolves around this lottery we call mining, which is very expensive to gain consistent write permissions from giving bitcoin a probabilistic model of immutability and 3) Bitcoins nodes are an active consensus defining population able to respond to attacks and changing conditions.

The paper doesn't make the assertion that all the power being used in a given region is renewable, nor does it specify source of renewables. While it is absolutely true that variance in season and time of day impact renewable curtailment, that doesn't equate to renewables are used in the day and oil and gas are used at night. That's such a gross over simplification of grid management as to be dismissable. The argument this twitter poster is making is built on assumption on top of assumption and literally no referable data.
Another important factor this individual forgets is that while there is varience in power generation there is also variance in power use. Less gets used seasonally and depending on time of day, a far larger impact than the variance in renewables generation.

Some people think it is about a simple proof of reserves then putting coins back the following day. I think it should go further to have any meaning, I think it should be about migrating volume to decentralized exchanges instead of going back.
All in all I think it's a fairly terrible idea and would much rather see people making permanent positive changes to how they manage their coins.

I agree, and I say they will benefit from Bitcoin not making those same trade offs by building in layers on top of bitcoin. We don't need ICO's, we don't need to reinvent the security model with compromises for every feature, we just need to build on top of Bitcoin.
Let Bitcoin do what it does best and let other layers do something complimentary like transaction speed or turing complete smart contracts or anonymity. Some of those features may even make it into the base layer at some point. That's how protocol stacks are built.

A needless confusion in every context. It is absolutely true that it is useful for describing the security state of the network in economic terms, including the incentives a miner might have from merge mining whether those are positive for the bitcoin protocol or not.  That doesn't mean the protocols are one, that doesn't mean anything occurring on the second layer impacts the base layer. It most certainly doesn't mean the bitcoin is doing anything with the EVM.
Because these economic incentives are true and they can be either positive or negative for Bitcoin it is even MORE important to correctly distinguish what activity is occurring as part of the bitcoin protocol and what parts are occurring in second layers, not to confuse them as you are attempting to do. It is not true that "bitcoin nodes to also process rootstock in order to mine on rootstock blocks safely". All they need to do is follow the BIPs enforced which are not rootstock specific, no RSK node needs to be run to avoid having your blocks orphaned.

Once you are in the millions of dollars range it becomes more a pain in the ass to get out of Bitcoin than it's worth. Just spend/live off your Bitcoin as necessary and hedge against price movements with leverage. If it reaches a high you want to lock in the price at go short BitMex futures under modest leverage to match your cold storage position. In this way you can protect yourself from volatility and lock in a dollar price without ever leaving your Bitcoin for fiat more than is necessary and you get to continue being your own bank.

You did not win this bet, your assertion that miners can reject a portion of the coinbase is not a fork of any kind, and is voluntary by the miner and not at all enforceable on others. To attempt to enforce it by orphaning all blocks with a majority of the hashpower that don't agree is a 51% attack and not at all backwards compatible like a softfork is. Kalin101 is right that to change the coinbase would be a consensus fork and you are wrong. Pay them.
Edit: some lively debate on what is and isn't an attack in this thread and I am wrong about orphaned blocks in soft forks. That seems to make the difference between a 51% attack and a soft fork one of perspective, and I don't see how making mining more expensive by reducing the miner subsidy or altering the valued predetermined inflation schedule is anything but an attack.  It seems it can simultaneously be an attack and a soft fork, and may even lead to retaliatory forks.

It's only victim blaming because the victim is literally to blame. If you are your own bank and you store unencrypted keys in your email you are asking to be robbed. If you hold coins on exchanges and use SMS 2fa you are asking to be robbed. There is no law in the protocol, keys are ownership. After years and years of educating and warning how can you say it's not the victim who is at fault? They didn't get 0-day attacked.
Applying standards of culture and law that exist outside the protocol to shame people noting the victim is wholly responsible is inappropriate. That's just literally how the code executes. Every single participant should be aware Bitcoin is personal responsibility and self verification.

They benefit from the meme posts in that memes are many casual users chosen way of expressing themselves and having low level, broadly accessible conversations about obvious topics. To not have those mechanisms of discussion leaves many without the tools to participate at all. Those users have nothing to contribute on a technical,  insightful, or educational level. Memes reach people on an emotional level as funny or sad or relatable in the way a technical discussion cannot.
Don't get me wrong, I would be happy to never see another meme again, but they are an important part of the way modern communities propagate ideas. IMO we should have something akin to a "shitpost Saturday" where memes and low effort posts are encouraged so we can enable  stronger antimeme moderation the other 6 days of the week without alienating too many casual users.

Anything with multiple resolution cases and execution paths will benefit. Make any valid script using Bitcoin opcodes and instead of having to publish the entire script which can be enormously expensive for complex scripts just publish the executed path. This makes scripts that could have previously cost too much to be viable a fraction of the cost proportional to the executed scripts fraction of the whole. The larger the whole, the more complex, the larger the savings versus existing p2sh options.

Thinking hot wallets are the only wallets that can be stolen from is naive. Insider theft has occurred at many exchanges, staff incompetence has led to refilling hot wallets in the midst of unobserved attacks, and some exchanges have even been sold and then emptied by new owners.

Today its validity is assured to the drivechain by the federation. That's the federated peg. Bitcoin users know it's valid because they can see the funds on chain when they arrive. The issue is trusting the drivechain to acknowledge deposits and approve withdrawals to the main chain.
Tomorrow the drivechains peg validity will be assured by bitcoin main chain proofs. The federation will have no function. You will see from SPV proofs on the main chain that the withdrawals and deposits are trustlessly valid.
Both today and tomorrow the internal workings of the drivechain, the validation and the EVM and consensus run on merge mining and node running.

I've altered my top level comment to indicate I may be wrong about orphaned blocks and posed several questions seeking to define what makes one consensus subset rules a soft fork and another a 51% attack. If the mechanism is identical it's a matter of perspective isn't it? I struggle to see how bitmain orphaning all non-bitmain blocks is anything but a consensus valid soft fork under these assumptions, the only differentiating factors are the negative impact on the rest of the ecosystem.  If that's the difference betwee soft fork and attack, then I again suggest changing the mining subsidy and scheduled inflation is an attack. Some miners would benefit while others go out of business, the assurdness of algorithmic inflation would be entirely lost, it would be negatives for much of the community.
So help me understand. When is it an attack?
Edit. The answer seems to be a soft fork can be an attack, but that doesn't make it not a soft fork. Thank you for your help in making me understand this and specifically for correcting me about orphaned blocks.

Global availability? You're telling me no one has ever stored or transferred immutable data online?
Blockchains triumph was bringing together dozens of existing techniques and technologies to create a new technology greater than the sum of its parts - solving previously thought unsolvable problems in the space of decentralized consensus and security. Not immutability.
To demonstrate the harm that can come from this misunderstanding consider this: If you think immutability is a unique feature to blockchains you start to believe it's a good idea to create a private blockchain. You want the features of immutability and availability, just privately. This is not a good way to solve the problem when immutability isn't a feature unique to blockchains. These private companies are misusing a decentralized consensus and security tool as an immutability tool when they could just use the already existing cryptographic techniques to create immutability in a traditional centralized model. See: R3. Most companies smarten up and end up developing a more traditional protocol or other centralized solution and some even call these "blockchains", but it's still an incredibly costly and pervasive misunderstanding.
Edit: If I'm going to get accused of trying too hard I might as well try too hard. Not to be pedantic (I'm gunna be), but because chain reorgs and forks are a thing, that means blockchains are not even the strongest form of immutability that exists.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:47:22




No I am not, I am explicitly stating the opposite. A federation is currently required for that job and that's what the BIPs allege to do something about, in which case the BIPs get passed the chains swap SPV's to do an atomic swap.


Miners on neither chain are responsible for the peg - again that's currently the federation. Once the SPV proofs are in place attempting to ignore a transaction as a miner would be consensus violating and cause that miner to fork themselves.
I honestly don't know how to put it in simpler terms. You seem obsessed with conflating these two roles as one.

Users who want big blocks now want it for reasons of adoption and user experience over future decentralization.

Users who want the status quo want Bitcoin to remain conservative to change and view unnecessary change as the opposite of hard money. To compromise is the status quo, which is what we have. I do not think most big blockers would consider the status quo the middle ground but it clearly is the ground between smaller and bigger blocks.

The value of both coins will fluctuate wildly immediately before and after a fork because it's entirely possible one of the coins will fail to gain the acceptance of users, miners, etc; or there will be technical issues with the fork rendering one or both coins susceptible to attack or theft.
If both coins gain a share of users, miners, exchange support, and other services they may both become viable. Once the fear of technical difficulties passes it is usually the case that either the one successful coin or the two successful coins will in total resemble or exceed the value of the asset before fork fears began.

So you are saying I can't publish a block that isn't a segwit block? That doesn't seem correct at all. That's not backwards compatibility. 
I was entirely under the impression if I published a non-segwit block it would be entirely valid and not orphaned. How is anything less not consensus changing?
If I'm wrong I'm wrong but that seems a far cry from backwards compatible. And more than that what distinguishes a given soft fork from any 51% attack orphaning blocks they disagree with? Blacklisting addresses or attacking competitors. Are we suggesting if bitmain wanted to ice out all competition that is a perfectly valid, consensus abiding soft fork?
Assuming all of this is right, it still would very likely be a fork because people like me would absolutely interpret that as an attack.

The larger blocks are the longer it takes to propagate them across global firewalls like the great firewall of china. The longer it takes to propagate blocks the more significant an incentive there is to be on the side of the firewall with the majority of miners so you get blocks quickly, and thus the greater the centralization pressure.
Further, the larger the blocksize the larger the entire blockchain record becomes. A 4MB blocksize will explode the size of the blockchain further reducing the number of full nodes operating and increasing the cost to operate a full node in both bandwidth and storage dramatically. Fewer nodes equates to again, further centralization.
When examining scaling options we want to pursue them in an order of priority that reduces the impact on decentralization as greatly as possible. Thus segwit is a preferable solution to a simple blocksize increase.

What about the methodology do you find dubious? You could easily recreate their methodology as they are using public data.
I suspect people who react the way you are don't even read the research paper. This energy most often could not be used to "turn off some coal power" as you put it. As the paper notes it is largely oversupply.


renewable energy which was formerly rejected by
GRIDS grids due to oversupply, known as
impact of curtailment to the earnings of
renewable generation operators is material: on a
fixed cost base, depreciating the high initial
investments, the curtailment of generation
output has a magnified impact on net
profitability—and hence sustainability—of these
renewable generation operators


refers to the consequences of over-generation
from renewable sources, where electricity which
is is produced is rejected by the grid for fear of
overloading and risk of a grid shutdown. The
primary cause of curtailment stems from the
over-investment—and subsequent overcapacity
That paper also notes that examples of european and north american mining are also largely influenced by oversupply of cheap renewable power.
TL;DR: Bitcoins power usage is making profitable excess renewable energy creation that would otherwise impact the sustainability of renewable energy projects.

Yes you pay the fee for leverage so you can avoid counterparty risk for the bulk of your holdings. Very worth it to avoid the possibility of losing your entire nut while maintaining the ability to trade with it.
Since your leverage is technically 1:1 backed you can support your position as necessary or as your risk tolerance permits. All worth it to avoid the possibility of getting knocked out of the game entirely from circumstances beyond your control.

Where does he say he wants to implement a wallet? I see a question asking if a BIP exists describing an idea he has or similar. It does. It's BIP32.
Answering a question about knowledge and not implementation with the requested knowledge instead of a full implementation of auxiliary functions and best practices: dense.
If you'd describe that as dense how would you describe having a tantrum because someone answered the question as asked instead of providing the full implementation specs for a wallet that includes the function he has asked about as a reference?

I've never implemented BIP32, and it's almost certain using an existing public keypair instead of following the directed PRNG seeding process is a terrible idea, I don't think there would ever be a standardized way to do that because it would and should never be done.

I'm not mentally drawing any lines, there is a literal line between roles taken on the rootstock chain and the role rootstock miners play and the roles bitcoin miners play and what happens on the Bitcoin chain. If something happens with rootstock or the evm that doesn't impact the Bitcoin protocol at all. No only Bitcoin miner needs to care beyond validating, as you note in your segwit example, obeying the soft fork.


I'm saying rootstock miners are already doing that job, and it has nothing to do with the actions of bitcoin mining beyond merge mining and nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol.


This is where you get into needless confusion. Those may ALSO be bitcoin nodes, but they aren't doing any rootstock processing. ROOTSTOCK nodes are doing the processing. 
There is no imaginary line between the roles, there is a very definitive line between the roles - was it performed by a rootstock node or a bitcoin node? They aren't the same thing, even if a miner runs both. Literally different software and protocols.

Every thing you are describing as a BIP 148 impact is either negative, like a privately mined chain, or actually has nothing to do with BIP 148, like using bits 1 and 4 to signal. None of what you are describing is a positive outcome.
You can keep pretending they care all you want, but again big blockers are as oblivious to the damage they are causing as you BIP 148ers are.

Yes, that is one variable that goes into the lower bound estimate that 77.6% of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewables. They have to make a number of assumptions they know will have degrees of error, that's why the result is range bound, with 77.6% being the bottom of their range.

If your miner is unaware of segwit at all it will orphan. It's not a matter of seeing or accidentally including segwit transactions in a legacy formatted block. I actually thought just as you describe only a week ago and had to be corrected. You can include non-segwit transactions in a segwit block, but a miner who knows literally nothing of segwit will orphan every time.
It is a needless confusion. It's a very functional distinction.  Failures on merge mined drive chains nor general changes impact bitcoin. Simple test for you to tell what chain is involved in a given action; what node was called? Rsk actions such as those involving the EVM do not call a bitcoin cli.

You want to spend from some Bitcoin somewhere in your tree. What information do you need to store to be able to do that, and also create additional change addresses?
BIP32 describes extended keypairs. Those keypairs contain an otherwise normal bitcoin address and some extension data. They are represented in BASE58 format with a prefix of xpub and xpriv. These extended keypairs are what your tree is made out of.
It turns out you have some options. Essentially you can start from anywhere above the depth of the tree you want to spend from in the same branch. The tree generates downwards from a seed. You can start with a mnemonic BIP39 phrase and convert that into your seed S for use with BIP32, you can store your master extended private key generated from S i.e. the top of your tree. Most relevant to your question you can start with one of your extended child keypairs somewhere in the tree and find its children - much as you originally describe.
I still think the BIPS you have been referred to are the best path forward for you. The answer to what is the minimum amount of information I need to spend coins from one address and generate derivable change addresses is any one extended keypair and their depth and index. This is all information available in the standard serialized format for these extended keys, xpub and xpriv prefixed.
TL:DR; with an extended keypair you can calculate it's derivative tree of keys. You don't need a bunch of new master seeds or to remember the master seed when finding the children of a given index and depth of the tree. You can create new child extended keypairs from any point in the tree. You can't travel up the tree - i.e. cannot use a child keypair to find a parent keypair

I view altcoins as the testing bed and maturing grounds for things Bitcoin will then improve. We (the Bitcoin ecosystem) release segwit on litecoin first, we adopt zkp's but use substantially different methods than coins like monero, and we adopt the EVM but significantly improve the way we store sidechain data to make much of it disposable.
The one thing of value in this space is bitcoins unique security model. Where all altcoins fail is trying to reinvent that security model instead of leverage it. I can see reason to use monero transitionally to accomplish a task not yet mature enough in Bitcoin - but for these reasons I would never hold monero or any altcoin.
Altcoins want to move fast and break things and good for them. Whatever doesn't break we will iterate on and improve, without all the ICO nonsense or rebuilding the security model from the ground up.

It's not. It's both. Both the federated peg and the drivechain exist right now simultaneously doing different jobs. Blocks are merge mined, validated, and the EVM runs on the drivechain.
Bitcoin enters and exits the drivechain via federated peg. The federated peg only impacts the peg, not the sidechain or the blocks it produces or any manner of consensus beyond the peg.
When the BIP passes the federated peg, and indeed the federation, is dissolved. So the drivechain continues to function identically, being mined by the majority of Bitcoin miners just like it is today. The only thing that changes is the peg. The peg moves to using onchain mechanisms that are forked in via the BIP. The drivechain continues to function exactly as it does today being merge mined by bitcoin miners.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:14:26
Federated pegs are for sure their own security model and not the solution to general sidechain woes. Drivechains however don't have those same failings and literally are secured by Bitcoin mining. The security of two way pegs will be greatly improved by for example adopting the "RSK BIP". Much as offchain state management (the real solution is always going to be offchain solutions) is greatly simplified by SIGHASH_NOINPUT. The point is to rely on Bitcoins security model and mechanism to yield these altcoin features.
The only delusion is thinking that Bitcoin won't take anything of value in the altcoin space and make it segregated (safer) and improve on the current design having learned from the mistakes of the existing implementation. We're already doing it, the evidence is in front of you.
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:58:29
Because it has repeated for the last 10 years running. Bitcoin bubbles and it bursts, lather rinse repeat. It's supply is also changed in four year cycles, development happens in multi year cycles (it took ~4 years to get segwit adopted). There is strong reason to believe Bitcoin is not dead, and if it is not dead it has a value greater than 3k due to it's incredibly limited supply and unique function. Bitcoin is an all or nothing value proposition. Either decentralization is a valuable security model or it isn't. Either the security model is secure or it isn't. There's no in between in the long run.

Some will, and the media forever has and forever will.
The beautiful thing about bitcoin though is it doesn't matter if someone wants to use it to buy fake ID's or engage in illegal activity. It doesn't impact or reflect on other users in the slightest. That's how I know that the people of Venezuela can avoid oppression through it. It's how I know we are truly a censorship resistant network. It's how I know Bitcoin is taking its place as a broad tool which will be utilized by humans both good and bad to meet their ends. It won't stop bad people any more than it will stop good people. Bitcoin is as unbiased in its use as any set of tools, regardless of how libertarians might insist it's theirs and theirs alone.

I still don't understand by these definitions what differentiates any valid consensus rule subset limitations from another. Bitmain could orphan all non-bitmain blocks if they have 51% of the hashpower. Do you consider that an attack or a soft fork or both?

I swore I already replied to this, but it seems I didn't.
It's a 19 page research paper. I'm not sure what you expect me to do except point you towards all 19 pages wherein all the factors considered and the hypothesis is described. Please read all 19 pages. 
Regional renewables curtailment data and especially hydro curtailment data (there is a ton of unused hydro capacity) from multiple sources including those outside China like Duetch Bank Research is coupled with public information about where mining is occurring in China to estimate the cheapest unavailable to the grid power available. These end up being the same places miners are conducting their business. The data is further cross referenced against that renewable's penetration in that region. The authors note that power generation companies have great difficulty applying this wasted curtailment power profitably and Bitcoin mining is a unique, low transmission cost method for these subsidy relying companies to begin generating profitability - especially in places where industry has since left or yet to arrive as anticipated pre-power infrastructure. These limited assumptions - that power companies would want to be profitable if the opportunity presented itself, that mining is uniquely suited to those goals, and that miners want the cheapest power available in their region are all supported by cross-referenced historical curtailment data for each renewables type and region.
This examination is then repeated for the rest of the major mining regions of the world including regions in Canada, the US, and Europe. All of this data is weighted against estimates of how much of Bitcoins mining exists in each region(conservative estimates of 60% China, 40% everyone else), renewables penetration (you cited a brief quote about one region and how their estimate originated from this part of the paper), and estimates of fossil fuel use for mining - again for each region.
Attempting to use conservative assumptions with known comparables to put all of that information together is what yields a lower bound estimate that 77.6% of Bitcoin mining is currently running on renewables if you make those same conservative assumptions. Some of those assumptions are that China currently has 60% of Bitcoin mining in the world with the rest having 40%, that 35% of that 40% is in the regions they identify and do their regional curtailment analysis on.
They then go on to address arguments that Bitcoins energy consumption provides no value and argue that is it in fact doing substantial good by making profitable these renewables projects and using otherwise unused generation capacity.

Bitcoin is a protocol of participants, and the culture of those participants collectively defines some outcomes. If everyone decides to fork, we fork. It's not worry you are seeing, it's outrage that someone would even suggest such a self destructive act to the participants. It's offensive and betrays the Binance CEO is not part of our culture of enforced immutability. The attacks against his comments are like an autoimmune response.

Holding your own keys instead of trusting an exchange is a good idea because the Bitcoin protocol defines ownership by the use of the private keys. If you don't hold the keys they are literally not your coins from the protocols perspective. Whoever you have left the keys with could steal your bitcoin at will or lose them.
Using leverage is a [good idea]( because you can keep the majority of your coins off an exchange while continuing to trade - which is ideal for high frequency traders.
Not using phone texts for two factor authentication is a good idea because if you do people could use social engineering to trick your phone provider to give a hacker control of your phone and by extension your online accounts including bitcoin exchanges.

I'm not refuting it could be done voluntarily by miners, we see them take less than the coinbase by accident sometimes. I am clearly confused because it seems to me that is the identical mechanism of function of a 51% attack, orphaning any block that the majority of miners arbitrarily agree should be orphaned. Like would you consider Bitmain orphaning all non-bitmain blocks when they have more than 51% of the hashpower a consensus valid soft fork or a 51% attack? It is a valid subset of the consensus rules after all.
If it is true and I am mistaken, the line between valid soft fork and 51% attack is entirely one of perspective. If that is the case, how is changing the incentives for miners downwards not an attack? It changes the cost of mining and could put many miners out of business, could significantly reduce hashrate and favour the few. How is that not an attack?

You could always read the research and see exactly how they come to the conclusion they do and the methodology used.  That would certainly be more responsible than a blanket dismissal based on assumptions that could be disproven by simply reading it.

Countries that have tried to ban bitcoin haven't had much luck. Venezuela still has enormous p2p volume where BTC is a lifeline for locals, while Chinese miners are still the major mining players and Chinese citizens use BTC to escape currency controls.
If the west starts banning Bitcoin I expect adoption to continue as such laws are unenforceable at scale.

So it's dumb strictly because your intuition says so?
Your analogy is nonsensical, an arm is not a viable organism where as a forked coin would be.
There has ALWAYS been uncertainty about bitcoins future, but what there isn't uncertainty about is bitcoins value proposition. The worlds first, largest, most secure, and most decentralized network of p2p trust will continue to exist on August 2nd. Altcoins aren't even vying for this coveted mantel, they all want features at the expense of decentralized trust.
If you're looking for further arguments in support of "this isn't the end of the world" feel free to examine the precedent. Coins which forked, open source projects which experienced governance issues have very frequently gone on to rave success after such conflicts. Certainly anyone who held their ETH through the DAO hack and the fork following the drama is an extremely happy camper.
Maybe being informed solely by your fear and intuition isn't the best way to form conclusions.

Have you seen any evidence at all that miners are going to follow the incredibly sparse population of angry nodes trying to wage a war against them? You don't have your critical mass of support. Miners aren't sweating. They are running the table with segwit2x and couldn't care less what shenanigans BIP 148 has planned.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:30:22
Yes, that is the difference. You believe that once an actor (miners) are doing two roles those roles become the same role. The evidence this isn't the case is that no bitcoin full node running the bitcoin protocol knows anything about any EVM. A full implementation of the bitcoin protocol remains without EVM in every sense of the word regardless of if miners are merge mining other layers.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:09:21
That would easily lead to a hard fork where the miners being constantly orphaned simply forked themselves. What you describe is effectively a 51% attack orphaning any blocks that don't agree. Most if not all soft forks do not orphan blocks, they are backwards compatible. That is their merit. What you describe is not backwards compatible it is an attack. Kalin101 has won this bet.

I have. You not acknowledging it doesn't mean I haven't. Either way, I've provided you all the source information you require to understand yourself. I can't make you understand that Bitcoins chain and the rules governing it are different from the RSK chain and the rules governing it despite having the same miners any more than I can make you understand the job of the peg is distinct from the job of block creation, consensus, and the EVM. If you want to willfully misunderstand that's your prerogative.

Like I said before, this is an exercise in futility for me. If you want to extrapolate a non-moral definition of right or wrong and apply it to what WolframAlpha is doing here, it's right. I'm sorry that I couldn't convince you despite exploration of the many issues faulting your interpretation of the word "right" or "correct" in this context. The right way to do things by any measure, and the absolute  correct answer to the query "bitcoin" in a system with no definition the is to further parse to "bit coin". "Bitcoin" is an incredibly new word with limited usage by linguistic standards, and as I've tried to explain the interpretation of language is entirely subjective. Just because it isn't in the encyclopedia on your bookshelf doesn't mean the encyclopedia is "wrong". "Bit coin" is a perfectly valid interpretation of the input "bitcoin", and parsing that further to "1 US Bit" is again entirely valid deductive reasoning considering the usage properties of the words "bit", "coin", and "bitcoin". 
If anyone here is guilty of being stuck in a single minded ideology of their own world, it's you. You aren't accounting for the subjectivity of language and not considering all the other possible meanings the text "bitcoin" can have depending on your culture, your geography, your raising, your context in history. You can take the word "right" and have it mean two directly opposite things to two different people, for example, as you've so succinctly displayed.
You could make the case it was wrong if it was displaying a definition for the word "bitcoin" literally, but it isn't. It clearly states it isn't.
Considering taking abstract concepts and bringing them into reality is my job I'd like to think you have no business telling me my capacity to deal with abstraction. I'm done.

Some of us live in the real world where every matter isn't a simple moral dichotomy between right and wrong, but a complexity of possibilities with benefits and detriments each. If you want to put something like this on the right or wrong scale of fallibility, it's most certainly correct as per the information it displayed for the input it parsed, and the input parsed was accurate as per any known words by the computer. The expectation for every programmatic dictionary to contain an accurate definition for every word in any possible context is absurd, plainly absurd.

The valuable thing in this space is decentralization as opposed to distributed networks. Alts necessarily don't leverage the unique security model of bitcoin by nature of being alts.
IBM's world wire nor XRP do anything that isn't better done in a centralized manner, which is well enough because they are centralized networks going to great effort to market themselves as something new and unique. They aren't doing anything new or innovative. Listing these things alongside Bitcoin is completely silly, you might as well list Western Union stock on coinmarketcap if anyone believes they are comparable. No one is saying centralized companies don't succeed, they do amazingly well and many are great investments - but why are we talking about them in this space at all? Why do you see them as even remotely related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:18:57
Bitcoin is a trust protocol. You can verify for yourself all the actions on the blockchain by using a Bitcoin node, and in doing so and holding your own cryptographic keys to your bitcoin tokens you can avoid trusting anyone but yourself.
If you don't choose to run a Bitcoin node or hold your own keys you are trusting someone. If you trust them with your keys they could steal your Bitcoin. As far as the trust protocol is concerned the bitcoin tokens are in ownership of whoever holds the keys. This is where the phrase 'not your keys not your coins' comes from.  If you don't run a node you could be lied to by omission about transaction histories or leak privacy exposing information.
I like to send new users to  there are a lot of learning resources there for learning about everything from how Bitcoin works to trading to development.
Bitcoin is a tool you can use to fine tune trust to be single party, multiparty, custodial, or any other mechanism you can imagine and program into programmable money.

I'm not missing that, it's a basic fact of any decentralized ecosystem run by miners. It has no bearing on the discussion unless your unstated concern is a bitcoin miner take over, since they use the same miners.

Kraken is a regulated exchange and has the problems of the space like anyone else. What makes them better than their peers is they didn't support S2X or the NYA, they have some of the best security practices including dedicated 2FA on any trading interaction, they don't use SMS 2FA and have been a leading voice in educating users of the harm of SMS 2FA.
As far as regulated exchanges go they are one of the better ones. Doesn't change the fact that if they aren't your keys they aren't your coins. Trade responsibly.

The whole point of bitcoin is that it is grossly inefficient. The security comes from the gross inefficiency. It would take over 200 megawatts of power and hundreds of millions of dollars in mining hardware to effectively attack bitcoin. The more competition there is in the mining space, the more power and miners which are required to own 51% of that space. A bitcoin which cost a very small amount to own and operate 51% of miners wouldn't be secure.

Bitcoin's censorship resistant refers to the inability of any party to censor you from broadcasting to the blockchain and using Bitcoin as a protocol. Where Bitcoin ends as a protocol so does censorship resistance and that includes the point of interacting with exchanges.

I disagree. In the context of an input textbox its standard practice to anticipate user error such as misspellings, missing characters, etcetera. In the scenario you propose anything that isn't literally interpretable by the engine should display nothing instead of attempting to further parse the text, and that's ridiculous. The engine has no definition for "bitcoin", it is not wrong it is operating exactly as intended in that scenario.
You're essentially saying that because Microsoft Word doesn't yet support marque style flashing text out of the box it's broken. It's a text editor and that's a function of text, right? I can't imagine how you feel about video players that don't play every possible audio/video codec.
