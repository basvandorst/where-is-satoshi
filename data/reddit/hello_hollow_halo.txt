Well that's dumb.

Shocker. Thanks for the "breaking news" that has been public knowledge for over a year!

This shit is going to $8k before tomorrow morning. MARK MY WORDS.

Yes, I made a mistake. But having a 3 day wait to fix is completely unacceptable. I'm going to assume that whatever your next reply is, will completely ignore this. BUT YOU CANT DENY A CUSTOMER ACCESS TO FUNDS OR ORDER ENTRY. It just isn't done with any legit firm. Sorry. It's true. But please tell me that I'm wrong and that is acceptable for someone to potentially lose millions for forgetting to inform their broker of a phone number change. Tell me that TD/JP/Goldman would do this to one of their customers if they changed their phone number. Please.

Yes, if its somehow proven fraudulent in the minutes it takes a bank to allocate a wire to its designated account, it could potentially be reversed. Kudos. Super likely scenario there. You win.

Agreed, I had a mental lapse there. But its extremely important to have a system in place for customers to have 24/7 access to order entry. Especially for someone like Gemini who wants to become a legit US exchange. You can't have any scenario in which a legitimate customer is locked out of their account for days at a time, with positions on. It's unacceptable.

Oh  boy. Trades are utterly irreversible in any market. That isn't anything exclusive to cryptos. A wire transfer can never be reversed once sent. Period. ACHs, on the other hand are, given that there is proof of fraud and the transaction has occurred within 60 days. Talk to a banker.

Calm down, keyboard warrior. I have brokerage accounts with some of the biggest banks out there. You know what happens if you change your phone number? You can CALL them and have the problem fixed within minutes. A 3 day wait to have something verified is inexcusable. CFTC/NFA/SEC regulated firms are required by law to have backups to give customers 24/7 access to order entry. This system that gemini uses would never be approved by regulators like that.

This does not justify a 3 day waiting period to have your new number verified.

Given the grammar &amp; spelling you use, I have all sorts of doubts about you.
