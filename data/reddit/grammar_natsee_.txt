Ok, a few millions are spare change for them, but... this whole highly self-devaluing marketing shenanigan in which governments were involved?
But I say it again: if Bitcoin needs that much logistics to be dented a bit, just imagine how powerful it is in reality.

This is the mantra whales use to confuse the small fish.

So you're saying they developed all this intricate plan and invested millions and stirred the waters at the highest levels just to inflict a dip in BTC? This would be awesome!

You are the real hero of this thread. You, and the other Bitcoin supporters who longed out of their faith in BTC, those who are bullish-biased in their hearts.
tbh, I am a Btc maximalist, but yesterday I shorted my baby. Not a fortune, but still sensible.

This could be crazy, but I believe in it, even with this so small sample size to date:
Bitcoin is acquired by visionaries, by those who believe in technology, progress and, most importantly, in virtual, intangible values. Therefore my hypothesis is that BTC is a leading indicator for the future of the economy. What happens with its price will happen with the economy within a span of several years. Therefore, the 2017 ATH may had announced the current hyper-bullrun of the major stocks and indexes, while the 2018 dip down to 3k may signal a possible 2020-2021 global recession... and so on. The future will (dis)prove this scenario.
