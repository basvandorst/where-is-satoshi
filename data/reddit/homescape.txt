Here's a step by step of what i did:
Copied address provided by app
Send 0.1 to address
Wallet receives, confirms transaction 150+ times
I try to spend some of my money, the transaction fails.
I wait 2 days, nothing has changed.
Send another 0.05 btc to my wallet.
Wallet receives, i can spend this amount but nothing more.
I enter the private key for the first transaction (0.1btc) into omiwallet. Omiwallet links it to an address which is empty.
At this point i start to generate addresses and private keys, using my 12 words in an generator.
Most of my addresses show up in the first 20 generations. The private key linked to the 0.1 bitcoin (my first transaction) also shows up as first generated private key. The address linked to this private key matches the one provided by omiwallet.
The address i send the 0.1 btc to never shows up in 1000+ generations.

Restoring pc to my previous version with 1.3.3 installed didn't change anything compared to me putting back the very first cache.
It's weird how the first cache has the non-matching address and private key there for me to send coins to..
Thanks for your help!

My wallet received the money, confirmed the transaction and shows the money. I cannot spend any of it, when i try the transaction fails.
I've added the private key provided by the app in a different app, it gives me a different address, which is empty.
The address indeed starts with an 1, but how can i check if the address is compressed or not, and even if i know which one it is, what's the next step?

I do have the private key from Jaxx, but jaxx does not provide a wallet.dat file to my knolledge. It works with 12 words, if im correct that's BIP39 encryption. Bitaddress only supports BIP38 and others, maybe thats why it doesnt show up as address when adding my private key there.

The oldest backup i have from the cache folder was made on 26nov. This backup was made 3 hours before i bought my 0.1 bitcoin.  The funny thing is that when i put back my cache from back then, it actually shows the address 1P5X as address to make my transfer to. For some reason the value stays at 0 bitcoins, perhaps it's a sync issue.
Requesting payment: 
Private key in the settings matches the one that i currently have, but does not match the actual address shown
Going to restore my pc to the point before i made the transaction, be right back.

Still looking for anyone with an suggestion, i'm clueless. I've contacted Jaxx support a couple of times at this point but it seems that they're rather busy. Haven't had a reply on my mail for a couple of days now :(

I haven't heard that theory yet, could you elaborate that?

The wallet im currently running is 1.3.7. I downloaded it on 28 nov from their website. Before that i had a download 1.3.3 on 26 oct. 
I both downloaded .exe files from their website

I have also tried this, it returns 'null'. My Bitcoin Core was fully synced at this point.

Is there a way to generate the private key linked to the address holding the 0.1 bitcoin with my 12 words (i'm assuming BIP39)? So far i've generated a root key, whatever that's supposed to mean..
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:57:26
I'm not sure if there's such command in bitcoin core, i cant find it in command-line options. Another forum suggests downloading Armory and importing the root key in there. I can't really understand what to do with the app tough. I'm currently looking into this.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:21:15
Removed it but i don't think the information was of any use to someone trying to get the coins. Anyways, do you have any other idea's on how to tackle this issue?

It fails because the private key it links to the address don't work together. Even when adding the private key to a different wallet, it gives me a different address.
I simply don't have the address private key it seems..
I've entered my private key provided by the app into bitaddress.org to return compressed and uncompressed and whatnot. It provides me an address ending with RJn and an compressed ending in 1Ki. None of those matches my address which ends in SPs

The one that according to omniwallet matches my private key isn't either.
I'm not sure if my bitcoin core is the same wallet as Jaxx. I'm going to see if i can re-create the link with my wallet in bitcoin core.
(The receiving address from bitcoin core does not match Jaxx, it must be linked to a different wallet, i only used bitcoin core to import my private key)

After uninstalling and clearing all left over folders i re-installed it. It synced with my wallet and gave me the value of what's currently on it minus the 0.1 bitcoin. It does not mention the 0.1 bitcoin at all.
In the bitcoin keys it displays the private key we've discussed before, this time it matches it with the correct address linked to that pricate key (1HHS) but since that address is empty it also shows 0 bitcoins from that transaction.
replacing the cache with the one i backed up before de-installation brings me back to the old situation, where said private key is being matched with an address (1P5X) and the 0.1 bitcoin shows up for that transaction
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:39:13
ha, just cracking the private key would put you in my position X D
Anyways, bitaddress.org gives me this when generating a address with my private key provided by Jaxx with the 0.1 transaction
As you can see the compressed address is the one i also get from Omniwallet, this address is empty. I'm assuming the 'bitcoin address' is the uncompressed one, i haven't checked this one but it isnt the one i transferred the 0.1 to.
Edit: the 'bitcoin address' is also empty.

I've already tried that, cleaning my Jaxx cache results in the transaction to be lost. Linking my wallet (with 12 words) in any other app gives 0 mention of that transaction to be ever made or received.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:03:32
I'll re-download and re-install it, replacing the (then new) cache with the one i currently have
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:03:29
I'm not sure about Armory, doesn't seem to be of any help.
Bitcoin core returns 'null' when importing my private key, but does not add any balance and/or transaction.
I need to somehow link that generated address by Jaxx to something with my 12 words. I'm clueless.
Edit: Sweeping my private key in Electrum returns a message saying no funds have been found. I'm almost 100% certain that my private key provided by Jaxx links to an empty address. The private key for the address i was given by Jaxx is not in Jaxx
