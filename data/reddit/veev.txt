Gotcha. Yea, I was confused about the fluctuation. Whatever I have, I have. Unless I spend it or buy more. That makes total sense.

haha thanks! man, what a ride!

Can someone please ELI5 to me? If I were to "move my bitcoin from Coinbase to a wallet" - doesn't that mean I would be "selling" what I have? Like, cashing it in, in a sense?
Isn't keeping it in Coinbase, keeping it on an exchange? So, when the price goes up, my bitcoin goes up.
Would it still go up in my wallet?

Ok, sounds like paper wallet is what I am interested in then. Any recommendations?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:45:33
Yea, I definitely want more control than I have with coinbase.
I dont want to sell, I want to stay in the game and hold for the foreseeable future. So, the best way to do that is to move it out of coinbase to a wallet, you're saying?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:47:05
haha got it. That makes it very clear. Thank you.
So, moving it from coinbase to a wallet is just making it more secure, not selling it. If, the price goes from 5800 to 6000. It is worth 6000 in my wallet.

I definitely understand now. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:37:37
ah, ok. then I am way more confused than I realized.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:48:28
Yes, I have been reading up on wallets. I think I just needed a person to assure me that moving to a wallet was not selling it. So, thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:42:54
huh, ok. So, keeping my bitcoin on coinbase is basically pointless. I just use coinbase to buy?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:57:09
Yeah, will do. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:06:04
thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:21:28
haha sweet. Thanks for the helpful info!
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:02:39
thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:50:30
awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:38:58
long term, yes. 
But, if I take it offline, isn't that essentially "selling" and locking in how much I have?
If the price goes up, doesn't that mean I am missing out?
I really don't get it, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:07:03
shit dude, definitely going to do more research into GDAX, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:50:03
Yes. Definitely. Thank you so much for making it clear.
There is so much information online, no one is talking basics like this anymore. I bought ages ago and pretty much just forgot about it until now, so I have a ton of catching up to do. Thankyou again!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:42
Thank you so much. I will look into GDAX!

hmm when you say "funding your coinbase account" I'm not sure what you mean.
