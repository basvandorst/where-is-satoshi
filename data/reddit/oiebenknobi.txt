The bakery won the case. FYI.
 


That's censorship. Moron.
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:48:29
At least I do not agree with censorship. 
Unlike you.

You agree with companies censoring people. That's just a fact, you even stated it.
Since, you agree with that, that's mean..... You hate Bitcoin, as Bitcoin **DOES NOT** do that.
Do you hate facts now?

While I think Alex Jones is an idiot, there is a principle here that is alarming. You are happy about the power of these companies because Alex Jones is an obvious tool so no one is bothered by the companies enacting their power over him. 
That's great but then how do you feel about net neutrality?
I bet you are a pretty big supporter right? **Don't ISP's have the same right then to speed up or slow down or take down content as they please?** They do don't they? �� How can absolute censorship be ok and right in one case, but then you turn around and say other companies can't behave in the same way?
Either there are rights for all, even idiots, or there are none and we should stop pretending that there is any impartiality.
You are a hypocrite.

I called you out correctly. You are a hypocrite who hates Bitcoin and I provided your own example to such.
You're just too stupid to realize it, as are most people who reference anything about Bitcoin. You are nothing more than a Fairweather fan.

You are too dumb to realize that both of these examples fall under your "private company" example.
It's either,
Private companies can't censor who access the internet! 
Private companies can censor who access their individual site! (You agree and like this one)
It can't be both.
You have proven to be too stupid to understand this, as you would have to acknowledge you were previously manipulated to an incorrect way of thinking. Which, we both know you are not capable of doing.

So you are saying you agree with censorship if it benefits the company?
Congrats, you hate Bitcoin.
You are too stupid to realize your political affiliation means nothing to Bitcoin.

The hilarious fact that you think bakeries need to mandatory bake cakes for everyone, but you don't think all companies need to be equal to all their clients is hilariously hypocritical of you.
