Yeah I get they hold my keys, I have cold storage, but seriously finex was one of the most reliable exchanges, I thought btc-e would get hit before them. where do you exchange your btc then? I can't use coinbase, the only option is stamp or btc-e and stamps already been hacked before and has high fees.

I setup bitgo to monitor my account back in the day and just yesterday it shows my btc from my bitfinex account were moved? So that means my btc had remained in my account until that point, so they were not STOLEN!? If Bitfinex moves my asset without permission is there anything I can do?

Whats funny is most of these company's have been hacked, that's the problem with the  "trust" part of a Centralized company model. Bitcoin is still more advanced.

Electricity costs.
fund a solar powered mining op that would just mine for the network and not greed.

What about the selling option? If you say your going to give me $340 for 1 bitcoin, are you really going to send me $340 for 1? i am worried that you might say oh you had to send 1.1 btc and now we can only give you $320. Because that would create a lot of confusion if i expect to get the full amount on my check. Thanks! Oh and on a side not when i create an order it shows me the amount of coins i need to send but when i click confirm it disappears, so i copied it and am going to send the original amount but am uncertain whether i should send it in case of a mix up.

And these were centralized as well.
@_date: 2014-10-26 06:25:03
Is there anything similar? This is really useful why would you remove it completely and not just leave it as is? Not hating just asking :(

Litecoin, then a projector from newegg, and then the rise and rise of bitcoin. In that order.

Most people subscribed to have not subbed to This means a loss of information because there's a lack of users.
@_date: 2014-09-01 06:02:02
I can confirm that it was working for me 1 hour ago. I placed an order for an acer projector funded fully by bitcoin!

May i recommend buttercoin?
Its a really great exchange and the cheapest i've found that lets you send in USD straight from your bank like a real exchange.

What i don't understand is after the "Prism" leaks anyone would want to buy these devices that record fingerprints and other personal information that can be directly accessed to monitor you.   If you jailbreak it maybe you have a chance but damn we are losing freedom here.

Ive been using your site for a few months now and i love it! I just noticed the new tools so ill have to play with them and check it out! Btw would you consider adding DRK/BTC /usd to your bitfinex charts? Thanks For all your work!

send electrum connections through a tor node?
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:29:41
There's also [bitrule]( wich send free text alerts
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:15:05
Use the blockchain.info App
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:28:05
just use [zeroblock]( or the [okcoin app] ( allows push notifications from bitstamp huobi bitfinex and others

You started at the peak bubble time, so obviously both data sets will show a decline...

my rasberry pi ran cool stock, and fine with that 5 cent heatsink and a usb powered fan never had an issue. Until lightning struck and fried it :'(
