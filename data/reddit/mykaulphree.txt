When I was at BitcoinExpo Toronto, I sold one of my blockerupter USBs (333mhs) for $5 to someone. 
It was funny because of his theory.  All he has to do is keep mining solo, and he doesn't care if its 25 years, because to him it was just like playing the lotto.  One day, by a slim chance you just might score a block and get 25btc.

come to think of it... England's politicians have seemed pretty quiet on the issue?  At least, that's my perception from this side of the pond?

yeah, i can't wait until the apple blogs start to catch on to it... then it will be about how Steve Jobs was really a visionary who foresaw bitcoin and pretty much invented it.

but since they were in so early - it's not like they wouldnt have been able to mine independently quite early in the game and start moving coins.

I love synergy!  I've been using them for a year, and just donated for the premium support.  I use it all the time at work when I'm dealing with a new machine that i've got to do alot of testing on, etc. Plus i'm always going between linux, windows, and various other OSes.

how is this avoiding your tax duties? i mean, you only pay tax on an investment when the value is realized. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:04:43
Dogecoiners need to realize their currency is a joke... because thats what it is and was it was intended for. I don't see any real value in it, and it's crashing hard.  
Why? The joke is getting old, and it offers me nothing special over any other scrypt-coin. I get it. "such wow" "many coin" - anything intelligent to say?
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:04:44
exactly.  this is a red herring, imho.  This is the front page when the new board members are pretty questionable themselves.  (a la Brock Pierce).

we as a community need to learn how to pick our battles and tune these people out.... and disengage with the trolls. 
We all know this writer is full of shit and is passive-aggresively dictating to us about obvious shit (ie sexism).  I get the impression she started out with premise of what she wanted to write "bitcoin isn't welcoming to women" and then decided to fill in the blanks afterwards. Obviously the writer doesn't like bitcoin, couldn't understand it - and couldn't find any solid argument against it... so she threw the sexist label on it. 
I've read stuff in the past about where bitcoin was this 'evil cult of white libertarian men' - yet the author couldn't tell me where she got the stats from... because... well? CHINA!
Bitcoin is open source.  open to everyone. download, use, contribute. nothing is stoping you... and we shouldn't have to do polls of how many jews, hindus, transexuals, or whatnot decide to partake or show up at meetups.

you sound like you have never had a conflict with the CRA/IRS/HMRevenue and Customs?  
And if you have a dispute with a company - can they just go into your bank account and take it without asking?  NO. 
I've had a conflict with the Canadian ones - and we're working to resolve it... they dont just arbitrarily go in and take $XXXX when you know the fee is wrong... 
you sound pretty immature.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:10:30
The paranoid guy inside of me wants to tell you to never trust any connection, and you should consider all connection 'compromised' - the realist in me tells you that its likely OK. But the cautious guy inside of me is saying you should use a 'secure ' VPN for all of your data transmission on a network you don't control.
