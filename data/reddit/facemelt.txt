thanks for the explanation.
Why couldn't Mt Gox users keep their bitcoins in a locally stored wallet? (our could they?)

I saw Caprice in the gallery.

Liquidity is not "inherent?"
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:15:39
I'm sure OP will come back and respond.  We just have to wait and be patient.

you misspelled cocaine.

sorry, but I do think it's him.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:58:11
thanks for the explanation, that was very helpful/informative.

noob question:  How critical is the Bitcoin foundation / Bitcoin Core maintainer to BTC?  Are these individuals appointed?  Could they potentially abuse their power?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:06:06
I still think something about this story doesn't make sense.  I don't understand the defensive nature of Dorian's reaction to the accusation.  Obviously, the invasion of privacy would prob. be unwelcome by anyone.  If someone accused you of being Satoshi, would you react the same way Dorian has?  I don't think I would.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:07:19


"Insane" would be if the evidence indicated that it is highly unlikely that Dorian is Satoshi.  Imo, it's much closer to 50/50.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:40:24


noob question.  who is this transaction fee payable to?
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:33:02
if one buys BTC-e, can one take possession of the BTC-e and trade them elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:41:33
I think this only happens through a bankrupcy restructuring process where creditors take control of the company; not sure where mt gox is in this process.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:42:12
how big of a player is Vircurex?

Could anyone explain what this topic is about?
"[Bitcoin 0.9.0 FINAL is available \[Changelog\] [Download]](
Is this an update to mining software?
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:29:08
wow, thanks! 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:09:13


That's what i don't get about this.  If you really aren't the person you're being accused of, you laugh it off.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:14:52
He's not claiming to know how to value bitcoin- that's why he's staying away.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:05:38
I there, I have another question for you if you don't mind (follow up from this Moronic Monday thread a few weeks ago.)
What does this mean? [ "Bitcoin 0.9.0 FINAL is available \[Changelog\] [Download]"](
Is this an update to mining software?
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:37:36
noob question... what's the advantage of trading coins in person? (vs. trading them online?)
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:11:36
what's the difference between regular btc and btc-e?
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:01:07
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:31:15
If someone accused me of being Satoshi, I would laugh it off and tell them they were wrong.  I would tell them they could believe whatever they wanted to believe.  Also, I'd show the world how it couldn't be me.  Dorian hasn't done this, imo.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:27:56
the total market cap of BTC = the total assets of one, medium-sized community bank.  So no.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:42:06
do you have a link to this stats page?
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:22:21
is it even possible to short bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:26:04
.25% commission is expensive (relative to stocks and other tradable products).
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:59:09
Mission accomplished.
*pats self on back*
@_date: 2012-10-29 03:42:05
thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2012-10-29 03:30:28
so this is basically a computer that solely mines bitcoins?  how many bitcoins can it mine (per week/year/etc..)?
@_date: 2012-10-29 23:43:57
Is the supply of bitcoins created/mined regulated by anyone?
@_date: 2012-10-29 00:24:10
could someone explain what's going on here? thanks
@_date: 2015-02-08 02:50:08
This is good news.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:29:42


you said investment firm; major banks have similar quant operations, so not entirely different.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:31:19
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:45:42
Why do these transactions take so long?  I thought BTC was instant?
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:11:52
Wow.. TIL. Didn't realize that.  I am fascinated w/ Bitcoin and am a big believer in its utility - I'm just fearful about the potential supply dynamics.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:41:44
Thanks for the link.  
@_date: 2013-01-13 16:53:00
Is there a preferred site/place to purchase bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:30:55
Thanks.  To me, this is the real risk in the value of Bitcoin- competing supply.  If there is nothing backing BTC (gold, eg) and competing currencies become widely accepted, there should be no difference in value.  Right?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:56:41
I get that, but these barriers to entry don't seem overcome-able.  If Litecoin were to become more widely adopted, the spread between the two currencies would shrink.  Other than adoption rate and size of community, there's nothing to prevent a competing currency from starting.  Amazon could theoretically start their own currency if they wanted.
@_date: 2013-01-14 03:38:12
thanks.  If i were to exchange $1k USD for bitcoins, what would be a normal expected transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-01-14 03:42:20
dang, that's steep!
