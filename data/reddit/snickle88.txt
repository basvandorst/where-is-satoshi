I’m guilty of coming to reddit for advice but if there’s one thing I think almost everyone here will agree with, is no one knows for sure what will happen or what’s worth investing in. 
At the end of the day. Your money. Your risk. Your call. 
Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. 
Good luck.

Hi wondering if anyone can help answering this
For example,  someone's coins are stored on a wallet that does NOT support BCC. 
Now that it is AFTER the fork. Can these people still  redeem BCC on an exchange or wallet that DOES support BCC?
I've looked at a few exchanges website statements on BCC and they state they will be giving BCC to those users with BTC in their wallet / exchange at the time of the fork. 
Does this mean those who did not move the BTC before the fork are getting screwed out of X amount of BCC?
If there is a way to redeem BCC still by moving BTC around plz advise. 
Thank you!

Okay and in the event I have the keys. What exchange or wallet can I move to to get my bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:09:51
Thank you for the reply.

What if you have it in a wallet and own the keys but that wallet does not support bcc?  Can these users move the btc they own to an exchange AFTER the fork and still get BCC?
Most exchanges say they pay out BCC only if your btc was in their exchange / wallet at the time of the fork. What about those who didn't move it before?  Are they SOL?

no ragrets.

Lol yeah.  If you want to call one year of price drop a crash. I would prefer a little stronger of a word than crash though. 
I don’t intend on selling,  but I also don’t subscribe to people’s blind optimism on some of these posts or comments. 
Please people, if you can’t afford to lose what you’ve invested, sell. Also maybe stop asking fellow HODLers and redditors for financial advice. 
Just my 2c.

I feel like I’ve heard this a few times over the last year or so... hmm.

Is mycelium compatible with BCH yet?  If not when will it be?
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:10:47
I’m a holder yet I can’t stand reading half the “this is what bitcoin will do, but I have no proof” advice givers. 
I want to see it survive and thrive just as much as the next person, but this whole sub is becoming ridiculous. 
Any post regarding price (every post now) is either filled with people predicting spikes with no proof, or haters saying “I cashed out at X amount, good luck losers”. 
Sure you did bud. If you were done with crypto you wouldn’t be reading these posts or taking the time to respond.

True prophet. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:35:33
I would love to dump my bch but mycelium doesn't support it and their explanation on how to retrieve it just seems sketchy. They even say themselves it runs risk of being scammed. 
They don't seem to have plans to support BCH and until I find a 100% safe way to get my BCH and get rid of it, it's not going anywhere. I imagine a lot of people are in the same boat whether on mycelium or another wallet not supporting bch.

Been wondering about this as well
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:35:04
Serious question to those who made such comments as OP screen shot. What are your thoughts now?  
I’m genuinely curious. Do you still think it’s a scam?  I’m not trying to be a dick or an “I told you so” guy,  but I know there was just as many people on reddit talking shit as there was on Twitter.  Would love to hear from the haters now
