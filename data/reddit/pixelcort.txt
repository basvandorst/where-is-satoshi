Interestingly the bitcoin address on that forum post never received anything:

To be fair this is for swipe and sign transactions. Chip and PIN transactions are a bit safer.

What about the best of both? For a forked crypto currency, also fork off the existing block chain, but market it as a different network to prevent confusion. Account balances in Bitcoin as of the date of the fork would be present in both Bitcoin and the fork. 
This way no one can accuse the forkers from profiting from the forked currency's genesis block.

When you're ready to sell your coins, what about if you have absolutely no record of what dates and how much you paid when you bought your coins earlier? 
In another reply you said using $0 as the buy price isn't recommended. Why? Is there any other way to report long term capital gains without knowing the price paid to buy earlier?
**Edit:** Removed extra question that was answered already.

This doesn't take into consideration how different hardware can produce different hash rates for sha256 and scrypt. 
 lets you punch in the speeds you're getting, as well as their energy requirements, for a better understanding.

Wouldn't the use of Proof-of-Stake blocks reduce energy usage?
This could be by means of using an existing crypto currency that implements it, or even a hard fork of the existing bitcoin block chain.

Or, better yet, fork an existing block chain, so account balances as of a certain date would also exist in the fork. 
This way it would be harder for anyone to accuse the forkers of generating a new genesis block in favor of themselves.

Each address has a private and public key associated with it.
The private key is used in a math equation when you send bitcoin somewhere. The transaction you make will include a number that others can use in a different math equation, combined with your public key, to verify that it was your private key that approved the transaction. 
Most web-based wallets online store your private keys on their servers. If their site gets compromised, the attacker can use those private keys to send bitcoin to themselves. Some web-based wallets store the private key on your computer, but it's possible an attacker could modify the website to upload those private keys if you visited the website while the attackers were controlling it. 
tl;dr it's all about the private keys. Lose them and you lose your coins forever. Anyone who has access to them can permanently send your coins elsewhere.

That seems to get you the secret exponent, not the two private keys. You'll still need more tools to get the private keys.
