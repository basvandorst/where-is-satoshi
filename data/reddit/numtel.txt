Writing a migration from one format the other would be certainly possible. Bitcoin's key and signature algorithm could be adapted to the nano code. There's no reason why a block lattice has to use blake2b. Bitcoin's scripting language/multisig support would be a nice upgrade to the lattice.
Nano uses proof of stake through delegates instead of proof of work and mining to validate new blocks. The migration could use a default representative on all existing accounts. This would result in centralization of stake in the beginning. No new coins would be mined and hopefully accounts would select third-party delegates.

Don't be so pessimistic, proof of concept will grow

Sounds like you could use the code I've written for my facebook bitcoin sender:
Just modify it so that after enough deposited, the information is delivered to the customer.

This article is extremely not-creative and fear-mongering. If you're worried about this, remember that without electricity and the internet, it all goes away quite quickly. The biggest threat to our existence is our distributed destruction of nature.
Use your early-adopted massive bitcoin wealth to restore the environment, steward deserts into forests and feed people using new agricultural techniques that work with nature or with very little resources.

Good idea with coinbase... it's switched!

I had the opportunity to be funded by the bit angels but the 3 month full time incubation period did not exactly work out for my schedule so I am continuing developing the application on my own.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:38:52
Are there apps like this for Google+? I have never even looked at Google+ but I had written stuff at work for facebook.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:12:56
The app cannot be responsible for your mistake. I have a major problem with taking these gifts back and don't feel like you should be frivolously transmitting them. Please contribute to this thread on github if you feel like you have a good argument for implementing this:
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:18:41
It stays in the fund wallet between FB users. I'm hoping to upgrade this to individual wallets soon.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:26:47
The problem with that feature is that it cannot be done programmatically. It has to use the JS dialog. I guess I can have it popup with the receiver's user name already filled in when that event occurs... give me a little time.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:23:22
I hear you on that! I made the app and I don't use facebook myself but I figure some people do so there might as well be a way to spread the bitcoin gospel to them!
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:59:51
For me, facebook had a 5 star selector in the sidebar on the right when using the app. It's not there anymore since I rated it.
This seems to describe it: 
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:20:56
Code is now up on github: 
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:18:15
You can click on the link in the status after sending them bitcoins and it will popup to send a request to the user to install the app. This is as far as facebook allows communication with users that are not already using the app.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:35:53
Post the link to the documentation and I would love to implement this.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:13:19
Quite interesting: 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:46:16
People use paypal. It's less secure than other bitcoin solutions but it is not absolutely insecure. I have been coding online shopping carts for years professionally. Nothing is black and white.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:34:38
It's in one wallet right now but I don't see a problem with expanding the application to support multiple wallets. There was no easy option that I saw on the blockchain api site that described how to programmatically generate wallets.
One feature I hope to implement soon is a secondary password above the standard facebook login that would be required to send any funds out from an account.
@_date: 2013-09-13 06:06:29
The app is now closed... It never really got much traffic and wasn't worth it to me to maintain it. Of course the code is on github and you're welcome to restart it yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:37:07
Which browser is the error happening in? I guess I should have tested in more than chrome :)

If you send a friend bitcoins and they don't have the app installed, it will tell you in the status message and you will have an option to send them a request to install the app or post a message on their wall about the transaction. In your transaction history, transactions to users who haven't installed the app will also have these links to notify them to install the app. These links will disappear after they install the app. In this way, you can tell which transactions are possibly going to be reverted.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:35:46
Definitely true. It's not a bank but it's also not unlike paypal. Sure, the level of security is not the same as having your own wallet but the convenience for transfer is its strong point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:23:55
Damn where were you when I posted my Facebook app?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:24:48
0.0005 to send elsewhere is blockchain's fee. The 0.0001 to send to a friend is to prevent spamming of the service. I will keep this adjusted so it stays around 1cent or so.
That post is what got me thinking about it. I started working furiously after I realized it would be possible.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:36:34
I'm not sure what the plan is for that yet. All the transactions are saved in the database. How long would you wait? I figured allowing the sender to specify a take back time would be an issue but I guess I could code more of an interface for it.
My main concern right now is definitely FB shutting it down for some arbitrary reason so I hope to get through a few days and see their response.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:20:36
I'm working on the issue. From my perspective, I needed to get this application out the door ASAP. If you have any tips on how to implement this feature from Blockchain's API send them it over.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:38:02
Thanks for the comments. It is the first version so hopefully I will be able to take care of concerns soon.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:06:09
Contact me on here, github or through my email with your facebook ID and I can work out any problems you have.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:25:31
In the screenshot it's just a dropdown but I replaced that with jQuery chosen before going live so you can search through your friends by typing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:30:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:32:40
Are you still getting the error? Is there no login button on the page? You may not have javascript enabled?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:31:51
Send me an email with your facebook ID and I can figure it out. Hopefully it doesn't come to that :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:40:21
Every facebook app is HTTPS, I don't know where you arrived at this notion.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:39:43
From what I can tell, everything is looking alright from the approval status and it will be included in the app center soon hopefully :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:20:44
Anybody who wishes to give it a positive rating would be helping out a bunch! The only step to getting it listed in the app center now seems to be not enough people rating it.
When it gets in the app center, more users will come. When enough people use the app, hopefully facebook will see that they need to implement it themselves.
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:25:51
If you want facebook to integrate bitcoins, show them that it's useful by using the app:
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:24:41
Get using the app and facebook will know how serious they should take it:
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:47:03
You caught me under construction... give it a refresh and another go. Should be all good!
@_date: 2013-04-07 04:30:14
If you send bitcoins to a user that doesn't have the app installed, the user must use a request dialog to send the message as facebook does not allow apps to interact with anybody who does not have the app installed.
Here's some screenshots:
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:23:20
It says on the interface. 0.0001 (~1 cent USD) fee is to prevent spammers from destroying the service. The fee to send to another bitcoin address is from blockchain, I don't personally charge a fee to send out to a bitcoin address or to receive bitcoins. I will adjust the transaction fee as the BTC value rises to keep it around 1 cent.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:01:03
Redundant answer but so you'll see it in your message box:
I'm pretty sure it should show up a place to choose up to 5 stars in the sidebar to the right of the app while you're using it. There may also be a box somewhere that has a place to rate recently used apps, I have no clue where that is though.
