Oh my god, I wish I could possibly express to you how much stress you have lifted off my back. Thank you so much, kind stranger. 
I got a mycelium wallet, and used libertyx to find a location semi near me, but this was still putting me out a day or so for me to get over there. I was getting really stressed at being without work for another day or two. 
Now I can work and pay rent on time, while taking a few days to really do some research and find the best options for me to keep buying Bitcoin. 
Thank you for changing the direction my entire month was heading.

No, I agree. But what about the bitcoin economy? Will people still value bitcoin the way they do now? Or will it lose a lot of value based off a shaky economy? Will vendors still accept it as currency? I know this post is getting downvoted so I appreciate a serious response.

From the looks of twitter some 'for the lulz' anonymous wannabe with misguided intentions and nothing better to do claimed the attack. Interesting though, as it seems like this particular thing would especially not be an Anonymous act.

No, I agree completely. That's the idea of anonymous, that its everyone. Everyone can be and IS anonymous. I may be wrong here, so correct me if I am, but from my understanding anonymous, in general, is against the idea and power of central government and banking monstrosities. It would seem, following that logic, that they would be more proponents of things like this, as opposed to perform DDos attacks on them. As a matter of fact, twitter user  accepts bitcoin donations.

Source? Out of curiosity. I do know that we only have 1/8 of our money actually printed. So if everyone decided to go to the bank and pull out all their money, there would be an absolute immediate crash. Any faith the American people have left in the dollar would be shot to hell.
