I'm waiting on a pending deposit into gdax...I feel like I have to spend it because I will lose money (2.5%) transferring the money back out to my back just to deposit into gemini and spend there. Thoughts?

This guy knows

I didn't even think you were a liar. I believe you. I just think you got lucky, because no one knows how to "read the obvious signs" because there are no obvious signs. Experts predict shit all day long and they aren't always right.

My identity has been verifying for 2+ days now
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:01:48
So it has more to do with limit offers, not people buying/selling at market?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:15:28
you cant sell shitcash for btc on gdax currently
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:46
Buy the dip......but first wait 10 days for your USD transaction to deposit!

Is there a way to invest solely in blockchain technology? Was asked this question recently and don't know the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:41:07
These guys don't know shit! If it's a bubble let's see their big time short positions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:31:02
No it's not. You're either a mind reader or just flat out lucky. Most likely just lucky.

I fuckin couldn't because my deposit ~~was~~ is still pending on coinbase!
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:14:09
You are not alone =\
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:15:02
Same boat. Debating just putting my money back in vs waiting for another substantial dip.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:37:03
Well I'll be able to purchase more bitcoin via my bank account correct? I just won't be able to sell/buy the bitcoin I already have?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:35:36
Okay, so even if I have possession of the usb, whatever is on it cannot be accessed EVER unless you enter the seed?
Thank you all for the help, I'm sure this information is available elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:57:11
You wouldn't consider last night a dip would you? Id be happy to put more money in sub 6250 if we can get it
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:19:46
What exactly is that?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:51:14
sounds good, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:02:22
