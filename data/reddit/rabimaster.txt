Would recommend looking into Vertcoin. VTC can only be mined on a  a GPU.

u/E-renter you are a legend! 
For everyone else, I took a punt and trusted a "random internet stranger" by giving u/E-renter my friends 11 words of a loaf wallet seed from which he was missing 1 word. I tried doing it myself and failed miserably! My friend had 9LTC that we though he would never see again until I found this post. We told u/E-renter to keep 2LTC if he could recover the wallet but being a proper bro, he only asked for 10% - 0.9LTC and recovered the wallet for us!
Tip on the way dude, Thanks again!

It wasn’t bought. The seller pulled their coins!

And there it is. GDAX has frozen!

Going up far too quick. Fucker is going to crash very soon.

Use Revolut.

It’s all good but I’m CC rich and fiat poor. I guess that’s not a bad place to be. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:32
Fuck me.

Ooh. BTC-E. You sure about that, spent years trading there and took my LTC out just in time.....
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:16:47
Well that’s not very constructive or grown up is it. I am only pointing out that if you want to transfer €90 to said person in Turkey, it can be done quicker and cheaper by using LTC over BTC. Don’t get me wrong BTC has its place as a store value but LTC wins in these circumstances. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:44:52
I’m not so sure that you are correct. So, currently on GDAX, selling $1MLN worth of LTC would take the price from $65.75 to $63.9 and only for a minute or 2. I think you need to educate yourself mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:04:38
I think you mistakenly wrote Bitcoin and not Litecoin.

Or 5/4/75 if he wasn’t American. 75/4/5 if he was Japanese or Chineese!

This is 100% the easiest if you are in the U.K. Faster payments on Coinbase means GBP in/out within 20 minutes. Sign up for coinbase and verify your account, then use Coinbasepro for fee free selling/buying!
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:24:23
I'm sure he's not using Coinbase! 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:16:33
Ok Redditor for 2 days who can’t use any type of pronunciation, here have my hard earned BTC!  
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:35:10
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:41:35
I’d suggest signing up to Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:54:52
When I first got into Crypto yes. Now I use Coinbase Pro. Less fees but take your time to familiarise yourself with the way it works. They now have GBP faster payments so you can send and receive fiat within 20-60 minutes.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:08:56
Exactly that yes.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:32:06
That's a very interesting question. Fuck knows!
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:01:33
You have to send a minimum of £1k. On their site they suggest  for smaller amounts. I have mailed to see if they have an issue with BTC. 
Edit: And........they do have an issue!
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:15:22
Cheers for that!
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:32:49
Well that's a problem. Anyone know what's the best route for UK Bitcoin buyers now?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:32:12
Apparently you can transfer direct to Bitstamp from a UK bank but you don't get a great rate. Anyone tried this?
