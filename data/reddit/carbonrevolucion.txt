so that is good or not?

Where can the circle break?

Yes, I get where you're coming from, but RFID chips have been and will be widely used. Walmart, Macy's and Amazon have implemented it into their storage management system and improved their performance rate by really nice numbers. I get why the Smart Water doesn't make sense, but what is the parallel you're pulling with it? Thank for your time mate

I think the guy is right, but I just laughed at your comment more than I should have 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:41:48
maybe I'm an idiot. but if you're investing in bitcoin, I think you should at least find out what it is

So what you mean is, considering the major percentage of the miners come from China, it can't be shut down?

What do you think about WaltonChain?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:15:22
Yeah, I get it. Their plan is to connect and control the whole process with RFID's, maybe even more towards business than customers, if you get what I mean
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:06:06
What would happen to China's market if they really shut it down?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:24:58
that's awesome

Why no answer?

That's a great parallel. But mining is what keeps Bitcoin alive?
