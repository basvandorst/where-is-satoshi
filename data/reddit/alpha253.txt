The world had the move away from the so called "deflationary currency", because America was getting its print on. 
If no, why not deliver on "$35 gold" when the French came to collect.

They most likely could have fixed this issue faster.
Sadly they most likely needed to replace x amount of coins (lost due to malleability).
At a price low enough to not cut into there profits.

ya trading magic, instead of being bear on bitcoin and taking your bitcoin and selling. 
Short takes dollars and sells someone a "fake" bitcion. 
If bitcoin goes down, and they close the position, they buy a bitcoin at the new lower price and keep the difference. 
If its higher and they close, its the opposite, they have to come up with the extra money to buy bitcoin at the new higher price.
Thats why when the price rises super fast it can force people into buying back the btc that was short. 
When you own btc the worst that can happen is the price goes to zero and your done. When your short, the price can rise and rise and drain a dudes account so the exchanges put in safe guards so there is no defaulting on positions.

nominal interest rates would not be negative.
here you go kind sir here is my 1 btc and you shall pay me back 0.9 btc in 2 years.
they would just be low. Lower then they are now. But at-least you would get to add deflation instead of subtract inflation.

I have no sympathy for anyone affected by this.

anyone with half a brain would have ceased trading there after 6 month usd withdrawals started happening.
Its just natural selection taking place.

"The block chain is growing exponentially."
Wait a minute, so they're pulling a BitBernanke on the whole deal?
Imagine that, digitizing a "currency", can lead the unsrupulous to devalue it and then it not being the store of wealth, as advertised.
This is shocking! ;-)

Real deflationary currency were really never used. 
Print more "paper gold bills" then actual gold on hand and its inflationary.
Pour other x metals to dilute gold coins and its also inflationary.
It becomes very tempting for the money issuer to oversupply receipts. Its what makes bitcoin so interesting.

ya from what i understand it dosent matter the amount of btc just the final holder of that fraction of a coin determines ownership of the asset, where to send dividends etc. trade that fraction of btc, trade your share company. follows the transaction threw the block chain to determine current ownership etc
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:16:20
could go gold,silver,bronze,red,green,blue,indigo,violet,black etc.
use that color sequence in btc pricing /wallets etc.

Furthermore, the reputation of gold as a unique and safe store of value has been growing for the past ten thousand years. It will take some time for Bitcoins to acquire that reputation. We don’t know how to quantify the value of gold’s reputation, but this reputation is probably the main reason that its value is 60 times that of silver.
Is golds history as a store of value that much longer than silvers?? He makes it sound like people started using silver as a store of value yesterday.

ya so say some company has an ipo and they decide to use blockchain / colored coins to denominate stock. then that colored coin would be one share of the company irreverent of its btc value. it is simply a token to show ownership of something else.

US personal consumption expenditures totaled $11trn in 2012
Household checking deposits and cash totaled $0.7trn in 2012
Dividing the former by the latter, we get 0.07 (which we will refer to as velocity from now on)
Is this implying that us checking and deposits + cash are being used to account for the total consumption of the country?? with no credit component added??
Ii think its more realistic to say that credit instruments were used to drive the 11trn us consumption. And the .7tn cash + deposits, to pay minimum payments

thats not how mining works
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:51:12
let me try and explain further say the block being mined  for simplicity sake is me sending you 1 btc
so a miner takes that block "1 btc from me to you" appends some random shit on the end of it say 1234.
runs it threw sha256 hash in the hopes that it will be validated. so lets pretend the bitcoin network needs 3 leading zeros from the hash output for the block to be valid and in this case it is. 
now fast forward 3 years, we still have that same block me sending you 1 btc. But now the difficulty is higher so i run that threw the hash again and i add 1234 on the end again. But unfortunately for me the hash output only has 3 leading zeroes and the network now demands 50 so that work is rejected and i keep trying till i can get it to output 50.
So you see the hashing power dosent process transactions faster. 100mhz at some low diff is the same as 100ph at the same higher diff.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:36:23
yes we should all acknowledge bank credit coin as the true original digital currency. 
And they dident even pre-mine it, they just made every unit issued due back with interest. 
Really who needs a decentralized ledger when you can have those great guys at JPM+friends maintain the ledger.

Bitcoin’s has one advantage over gold in that it is easier to transfer.
infinite practical divisibility seems like another good one 
how about free storage
