I know this sounds heartless and cruel, but 'Blind Eye' is just not a term I like using any longer. What the hell does that even mean?
What are people supposed to care about? Reddit, the news, even individual people can't get their story straight on this. Everyone has their own agenda that they are trying to further, even if it is for a good cause. The average person is just trying to make a living and be happy. Should they also be using all of their hard earned money and little free time to try and stop human trafficking in Africa? ISIS from killing more people in the middle east? Poverty in America? Reforming America's inner city school system? Corporate run prisons? What about raising their kids and planning for the future of their family? Legalizing drugs? Campaigning for gay rights? Oh I just heard we are abusing livestock and we should stop that too. Don't forget electing Bernie Sanders -he'll fix those pesky banks!
I think some of these issues are little known, yes, and I agree that it could use more media attention. But at the same time, I think there are just TOO many issues to focus on in our media driven world. There are too many things wrong. People know about the issue and just don't care.

Look I'm not a big fan of this trial either, but I'm 99% sure this paragraph of preachy bullshit went up AFTER he was implicated in the case, not before.

Eh I disagree, this is free market and free will taken too far. Under the same mentality we wouldn't have a society at all since everyone should own their own bodies and should have the run of the place. 
Even if you didn't take this theory that far, and kept it within the society I still disagree. A LOT of children while growing up (including myself) were extremely easily influenced. I don't think having such easy access to hard drugs (e.g. highly addictive substances) would be good for society at all.
