Fucking A! You hit the nail on the head, the **sheeple** keep wanting the scraps from their masters table.
Hoard the fuck out of Bitcoin, less supply more demand just like the Emperors new Gold.

Very eloquently expressed, if somewhat coincidental,  and softened expanded version, *"Tinfoil Hat Theory"* :)  of my raw and direct OP of yesterday, titled **The Sheeple &amp; Bitcoin** ;D)
         ------------------------------------------
                     The Sheeple &amp; Bitcoin
Lets face it most of the public don't give a shit about the correct terminology of Fiat, Crypto or Gold.
What they care about is money! you know the stuff that buys food beer and pays the goddamn bills.
Let's be honest this sub does not represent the demographic breakdown of the mainstream public, it's full of geeks, smart arses and libertarians, the rest are shills and trolls employed by the "MAN" to throw a spanner in the works to fuck this crypto shit up.
The so called sheeple are busy watching the latest soap opera or some vacuous Kardashian related shite.
If not the Oscars or some Z Celebrity, they're engrossed by the latest "Demockery" rigged voting competition, misguidedly thinking that their vote somehow counts lol :).
Before I forget,.... those who express philanthropic tendencies, and wish to empower the unbanked around the world, very noble ..but lets be real.. most of you don't give a flying fuck about them really!, it's just a good line to drop when your real motive gets exposed.
The first priority of most sheeple in the western world is to find somewhere to live, and that might involve getting a mortgage or renting with bank controlled fiat.
Once you sign the dotted line you are subject to the **"TAX!"** that they will enforce with their guns and corrupt criminal police force.
As for the people of the so called third world, their first priority is food, dodging bullets and bombs, that the sheeple of the first world empowered their sociopathic leaders to manufacture for profit, to drop on the innocent and disenfranchised in the so called third world.
If you want Bitcoin to make a difference, **"HOARD"** it and **"SAVE"** it or **"HOLD"** it or **"HODL"** it.
*"I know, I know"* many people say you should just use it, get real! you don't walk around with a Gold Bar all the time, do you?
For christ sake! stop trying to copy banks, you have the power to get the price of each Bitcoin to $5,000 at least, and watch the tsunami of so called mainstream adopters.
Unpalatable as it sounds **"Greed"!** is the catalyst, you're fortunate as early adopters, and it's your duty! to get BTC above the price of Gold, and watch the fiat ivory towers collapse
