Outliers make excellent material for general guidance.

Which country? Define "regular life" in terms of day-to-day bizness transactions (you know, the thing where the "old system" is to be replaced.)

No, the type of guy that sells you a seminar on how to *buy* a seminar. FTFY. Remember, there is a sucker born every day, and there's always someone profiting from that fact.

ETFs are backed by actual fiat currency that is liquid and readily accessible. Ranting about rich boys getting richer does not change the main issue with BTC (or crypto currency in general.)
I'm optimistic about crypto currency *when* speculation comes to a halt. Everyone is "hodling" make them tulips or unobtanium ingots. They do not circulate right now, they are not currency.
They will be great when they begin to circulate to buy shit with. Until then... hodl?

That can only happen when cryptocurrencies have sense of price (their valuation) with which to conduct transactions. 




I agree with this. This is why current valuations have been bonkers (and why we are seeing not just a correction, but a full-blown recession in crypto values.)
