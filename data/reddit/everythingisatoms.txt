Maybe Bitcoin will train a whole new generation that doesn’t make mistakes when it comes to dealing with money. Then it will become second nature to future generations as well. 
  
It’s like we are trained to put food into our mouth, not on our nose or cheeks.

Idk man. Maybe the world will be divided between those who use fiat money, and those who use crypto. Maybe half the world is competent enough.

We should not do absolutes when it comes to future though.  
  
Maybe we’ll get cybernetic-enhanced brain and hands that reduce error to 99.99%. Then the error rates are negligible. People who do accidents with their money by then are treated like car drivers who went into accident, it’s their problem.

And since the majority of people are stupid, that makes most of these concepts stupid.

Pretty sure you can find a lot by brute-forcing all BIP39 words in the puzzle.

Every dollar exists as debt because it has to be paid back **with interests**. They hoard the right to create money but in reality it’s stealing money from the people.

What are some of the biggest misconceptions outsiders have about Venezuela’s situation?

Mass effect comes from the mass ‘unscientific’ population.

Malaysia is one of the countries with high English  literacy in South East Asia. Most signboards for shops at street level have English on them and English is commonly used as the communication language in private sectors.  
  
Some of the most visited websites in Malaysia are presented in English, such as paultan.org, lowyat.net, lazada.com.my, malaysiakini.com and thestar.com.my  
  
However if you’re from a country where English is the first language, you might find the English spoken in Malaysia funny, weird or broken. Some calls it ‘Manglish’ (a mixture of local slangs + English).   
  
If you happen to travel to Singapore and Thailand, consider stopping in between (Malaysia), it has warm and wet tropical climate all year round, lots of delicious food, islands, beaches, tropical forests and mountains. Malaysia has a population of around 30 million, with a quarter of them centered in Klang Valley (a greater part of geographical area that consists of the capital Kuala Lumpur and surrounding neighborhood cities).  
  
Just don’t try to bring in any drugs because it’s an offense that’s punishable with death penalty (same as Singapore).

Then don’t be the parasites. Be the host and let the parasites take your money.

I think people just need constant on your face reminders of the power of permissionless money without requiring them to scour around for resources.

Actually it’s much less, more like about the amount of people that can sit in a bus owning 50% of the world’s wealth.

No shit Sherlock. Hindsight is 20/20. Sing a different tune if Bitcoin is $60k now?
