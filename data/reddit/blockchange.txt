Every adult should have a gun and every year on the same day at a very specific time of day, say 12:00pm, it should be required by law that very person, government officials included, pull out their guns and aim it at one person they want to kill. If they kill them, they will go to prison for murder mind you, but the psychological effect of letting everyone know they can kill anyone they want under those conditions and letting corrupt leaders know they are at risk of being killed for their corruption should effectively keep a society safe and honest and keep a level playing field.

I mentioned just previously in response to another comment that it has been explained that the current model requires 1000 satoshi fee and a minimm of 546 satoshis sent. By that math it would cost me roughly 60 US cents per 100 transactions. I don't think that's an unreasonable amount for storing my transactions. Besides, that argument is a slippery slope. If I pay the fees, who can say it's not a worthy enough transaction to propagate? (I realize you might have been responding on the premise of me planning on paying no fee at all, but that has since been deemed impossible).

Considering bitcoin is an open source decentralized movement where everyone participates willingly, I'd say it is perfectly incentivized or else people wouldn't relay transactions. If this evolves in some way as a result of my transactions somehow, so be it. Evolution is a great thing. For the record,I don't understand why relays shouldn't get a portion of a fee. Seems like they should get a little something, but I guess the consensus is that simply helping the network helps the price of your coins.

You could say that.

I'm skeptical a bitcoin world would be the paradise it is advertised as. From where I am sitting, it seems to be a big-player-only game advertised in its infancy as a little-player-only game but growing slowly towards wealth and power disparity in a bad way.
It also seems to provide a perfect way for military, governments, and the wealthy to take your money without having any way to get it back (read: Silk road bust), and with an added layer of obfuscation and deniability never before possible to them ("uhh..it was China!").
Frankly, this whole one world curreny agenda is exactly what they want. When Google and IBM are the only ones powerful enough to mine a block, just how much freedom from politics does our money give us? I enjoy projects like bitcoin, but I think bitcoin cannot succeed alone and needs massive education attached to it, education that is presently considered threatening and politically incorrect. In other words, a true history lesson of wealth, corrupt governments and wars, and what their driving causes are (both politically and psychologically).

In your day grandpa, I know it was easy to just find all the bad guys by asking if they went to church or if they were black or not, but in this modern world we live in it takes more evidence and reasoning to convince us of why something is wrong. Guns? Drugs? Porn? Alcohol? Abortions? Stemcell research? Sex changes?

Would my transaction of 0.00000546 BTC not even be sent from the client then? Keep in mind, I don't require the coins to be spendable or even truly 'receive' them in the traditional sense (written to the blockchain), only to have my client send and my server's client be notified by the bitcoin network of the attempt to send so that I can scrape the data from it for databasing purposes.
I looked into BitMessage to achieve the same thing, but I have some doubts of the reliability for *instant* and repeat automated message creation from a script. If I understand bitcoin correctly, I can embed the HEX data I need in a minimalistic throwaway transaction as described and still relay the data without needing to do anything other than listen to the blockchain on the receiving end.

Prosecution of DPR is also a defensive move from the state whose control model is threatened by him. Defending against threats in and of itself is not always a righteous action. One must turn to morals and common sense. While the state remains a corrupt and abusive force stripping our liberties, Ulbricht is no hero for mimicking their thuggery and attempting to take another man's life. Before you defend him further, think about how your defense can be used by the state against him as well to continue their international abuse of human rights and perpetrating violence against other countries and peoples.

While I trust bitcoin to store data (by trusting encryption), I do not trust Tor to retain user privacy (by not trusting what could arguably be described as the world's largest honeypot). It also isn't a point to argue. From a security standpoint, no VPN or Tor network could ever be as functionally safe as embedded signals in a publcly and widely used blockchain, when the use case requires absolute anonymity for the receiver more than the sender. While I'm not set on using bitcoin's blockchain (testnet? Dogecoin?), I'm confident that this is the right line of thinking. Direct connections are incompatible with this security model.

The most important property is that the server receiving the signals remain completely isolated, remote and not require direct access to the sending server. This would allow it to be virtually undiscoverable and the blockchain would function as the anonymous passive signal relay. I'm not sure if any such technology exists in any other fashion, besides maybe BitMessage, but I imagine given the small size of their network it would be incredibly less difficult to discover a client's information on their network than in bitcoin.

No, as you just realized by me editing my original post with a more succinct statement, comment histories to *not* always speak for themselves.

On the topic of bitcoin nodes I'm sure the free market will handle it. As I mentioned before, I don't completely understand why they aren't paid a fee for their relaying. Seems common sensical. People share torrents because it helps them download as well. Shouldn't relaying hell the relayer *bitcoin*? Maybe by reducing their own fees or something?

It sucks and it is a problem that will never be fixed probably but then again, what genius thought bitcoin was a good idea for in-person retail? Seems better as a way to send large amounts once in a while, like a gold transport network. Microtransactions should probably be handled off the blockchain or by an altcoin/sidechain.
I find it interesting that the core devs suggest against accepting 0 conf and that double spends have been proven possible, yet the cult blows it off to downplay the massive delay in the so called "instant money". Evolve people, there's no shame in recognizing bitcoin's strengths and weaknesses and beginning to plan for its perfect use case instead of shoehorning it in to every financial, voting, DNS, etc. use case.

While the title mentions an interest in transmitting without a fee, it has been explained to be that a minimim of 1000 satoshi fee would be necessary for each transaction costing roughly 60 cents (USD) per 100.

Seem to be a lot of opinions here that just because a law is ignorant that no law was broken. While it may be an unfair law, denying the law was broken in the jurisdiction is was broken in is a display of cognative dissidence.
Claiming someone doesn't deserve punishment for knowingly breaking a law merely because they "don't deserve it" is akin to scamming a member of the community and rationalizing it being okay because "they deserved it".
The most troubling part of this whole debacle has been watching the community, a supposedly decentralization-loving community, get caught up in idol worship. Men are fallible. We do not need leaders or spokesmen here.
It's also deeply ironic that a so-called pioneer in a cryptocurrency community was caught for dicussing his criminal activity in plain, unencrypted emails. Is that the level of competency that passes around here as defendable?

In principle you're spot on. Unfortunately, the US "Justice" Department considers all money as laundered regardless of if a crime was committed, hence civil forfeiture laws. People get arrested for "money laundering" by simply running legal, licensed gaming websites. It happens because the government has no real crime to arrest them on, and as anyone knows who has had a run in with a bad judge, the law doesn't matter. All that matters is how a judge, prosecutor or cop thinks of you.

You despise the draconian and rights violating legacy banking system, so you get into bitcoin and love it so much that you create a business to help others buy it but due to draconian and rights violating legacy banking system regulations need to operate the same way as they do.

The bitcoin network provides significant obfuscation and deniability. It's easier to track you and harder to deny you were looking at porn when the logs show you connected directly to the porn's IP address. If a tag with a hash of the filename of a porn video is embedded into a transaction, those listening for that transaction have complete deniability and protection (assuming the filename is all they needed). Running an alt-coin specifically for this purpose would result in more work for no additional protection.

Can you explain more about this OP_RETURN business? Is that a normal transaction or just a network query of sorts? Does it cost a miner or transaction fee? Do bitcoins need to be sent to engage it? 
In my specific usage case the data does not need to be permanent, just unalterable by hackers, publicly broadcast and once utilized as a signal for specific actions, it can be eraaed (maybe after a week). Bitcoin solves this albeit clunkily through the blockchain with the additional layer of obfuscation and anonymity at the transport layer.

Poll the same students and ask them if they believe it's the job of the nanny state to tell us what we can and can't do. Do you really think you're going to get a positive response?
It's all in the framing of the questions. Today's politicians are only allowed to continue doing what they do because of their deceptive framing and wording. How does a government agency that tells you what you can and cannot watch on TV sound? How about one that tells you what you can and can't eat, that favors large pharmaceutical companies while making it a near life sentence to experiment with anything those big name pharma companies didn't produce? How about an agency of the US government that tells you you can't cross state lines without letting agents enter your vehicle for searches of fruit (and whatever else)? This all already exists and it's ignored because of framing, in one word, "safety". The public is growing smarter and more connected. The promise of safety is beginning to be seen for the impossible truth it is that our older generation already understood.

This applies to anyone reading your comments.

From what I read about him, he convinces people to invest in his service to the tune of millions of dollars but disregards direct orders from the CEO not to attempt skirting federal law. Through his unencrypted emails with criminals it is later discovered he doesn't take his role of CFO seriously and will do anything shady for an extra buck. His greed and amateurism ruined the company and destroyed his investors but for some reason, he considers himself a bitcoin hero. The next 2 years in prison should be long enough to rethink that position.
Edit. Judging by your downvotes, there are still a few remaining fan-boys here who share his delusions.

If Theymos didn't own this place too I would subscribe.

I used to think of it as a ponzi as well until I read up on fiat currency, commodities, stcks and bonds. Bitcoin is no different from gold in respect to how it gets its value. It may be ludicrous and the panting fetish dreams of libertarians and get rich quick schemers that cause the various bubbles we experience, but bitcoin itself is categorically incompatible with a ponzi. That does not mean it shouldn't be watched closely for other reasons (e.g. one world currency / new world order).

Why would they? Is anyone going to spend it there? You need demand first.
