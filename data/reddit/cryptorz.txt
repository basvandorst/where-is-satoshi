How about show us an office where your "team" works and where people pick up the money we've sent them. Speaking of that team, that's a big ass payroll assuming Rebit.ph isn't a sweat factory because everyone is wearing suits in the pictures.
Also how are you complying with "anonymous" people sending Bitcoin to others in the Philippines? 
If your company is "holding a majority in Bitcoin" then how do you leverage yourself against volatility? Sounds like the business model is based on a lot of speculation.
Sounds a lot like Localbitcoins.com seller in Philippines to me tricking people to not use an escrow system.

You don't need to ask permission to send and receive money, this is fucking ludicrous. Bitcoin allows you to ***JUST DO IT!***
Bitcoin was made so that the people can decide what you can and can't do. The limitations are within the protocol itself. So if you are able to send and receive without approval then you are able to send and receive without approval. Bitcoin was made to change government and regulators, not the other way around.

Use Blockchain.info's Shared Send service if you are wanting to make your bitcoin transactions nearly impossible to trace.
If you purchase Bitcoin from CoinBase or LBC or wherever, just send them to a Blockchain.info wallet and then send shared them with 10 iterations to a new wallet. Then once the coins are at your new wallet, you are 99% anonymous with hardly any links (they call it taint) to your original address. You can also do this method in reverse to cash out your Bitcoins.

Here's how scams like Ethereum work:
Sit and think a really long time until you have this **GREAT IDEA**. Next you need to tell everyone you know about it and even make a cool 30 second video about it. Now at this point, everyone thinks your idea is really fucking awesome so you start building a large founders list of people you think are important or are special. Now you're starting to look legit... A long list of names that don't actually contribute anything, but you post them proudly because it lends your **IDEA** some credibility. At this point your pot is stewing pretty good.. just let it sizzle awhile while you stir in a little bit of paid-for PR and paid-articles. After your PR, Shilling, and pumping is done then you step up to the real big wammy.
***IPO*** TIME!
Now it's simple! You just keep doing what you've been doing, see all the easy money come in for your **IDEA**. Now distribute your free money to your shills and paid "advisors" that helped do your dirty work.
Now just start falling silently away, with less and less updates and come up with some silly garbage. It doesn't really matter what you do now because you won! You've officially pumped your shitty idea for some worthless clone vaporware and actually received Bitcoin, something that has value.
Isn't it kind of funny that all these great innovators and programers keep creating new currencies? It's so their greedy ass can pump and dump their vaporware idea after hyping it: Mastercoin, Asiacoin, Auroracoin, SAFECoin.. the list goes on and on, these are just the quick ones that come to mind. 
Bitcoin is **PROGRAMMABLE** money that is **DECENTRALIZED**. If you have a good idea, improvement, or a feature that you would like to have in Bitcoin then you can simply suggest it. If everyone likes this idea and it truly is a game changer and a benefit to the network, then guess what? The idea will be added and everyone will start using that version of the client! That's the whole point of open-source software! So everyone can collaborate on the same idea!
So ask yourself once again, why do they keep making these alternate scam coins, currencies, and companies? It's because they are simply greedy fucks that are taking advantage of the sheeple after blasting them with PR Mind fuck campaigns and using lame ass stock photos of "CEOs" of supposedly successful companies. 
Bitcoin can be molded anyway we wish it to be and anything can be changed, modified, or added on to. The true reason they don't do this is obvious... They are not out here to bring **YOU** new tools and freedom, they are simply out here to steal from you in a deceptive way.

The people "talking to regulators" or "working with regulators" are fucking morons.
Bitcoin is a collective of the people using it. No bullshit laws, licenses, or regulations will ever stop or prevent the use of Bitcoin. You do not need anyone's permission. Grow a set of fucking balls.
I don't understand why people sit and suck the dick of these "regulators" or "political" people with their corrupt agendas. Bitcoin was created to avoid these people and their bullshit.

Some people are thinking it's a story but in all reality they are trying to promote their business. This is likely why David Parker, owner of CCN, replied as the way he did. There is a fine-line between what is considered "advertisement" and what is considered a "story".
It's not a black-and-white line. I believe that CCN is honestly one of the best, if not the best news site out there for Bitcoin. They have plenty of talented writers which aren't afraid to publish the truth. They just simply aren't in the pocket of these big companies (circle, coinbase, bitpay) and they have to make do with selling advertising price. They get over 10,000 unique hits a day and now they are also building a "community" which has social profiles, groups, and messaging.

I'm just curious what bank or payment processor is facilitating the transactions.
There is a reason no one else does this. Here are a few:
 Banks or payment processors don't want to work with bitcoin businesses
 Too much fraud, chargebacks
 Takes a large sum of capital to do quick turnarounds from payment processor -&gt; bank -&gt; wire transfer to exchange -&gt; buy bitcoin again
 Fees are pushed on to customer (3% processing fee + markup fees)
 There's the fact of sharing a ton of private information with some random employee at some random company which may happen to leak all your data voluntarily or involuntarily.
Accepting Debit Cards or Credit Cards just doesn't seem smart unless it's a POS transaction where a pin number is entered. The only way I feel that it's possible to overcome the banking obstacles is by making shell companies and doing magic accounting tricks, which doesn't last very long.

Your post is very inspiring, it coincides with my beliefs and ideologies about Bitcoin &amp; Governments.
Can you please enlighten us on ways and methods for us to fight these proposed regulations? I myself am already ignoring any and all ridiculous oppressive laws that are generated by the Government, but beyond that I don't see an effective method to combat these. I wish to prevent them even more so than ignoring them.
Please shed some light on the subject for us in ways of how to dismantle this oppressive regulation. You are certainly right in the matter of others being afraid of "Big Brother" and his entities. Many do not have the same courage, passion, and enthusiasm as some of us possess when it comes to Bitcoin and civil liberties. It is in the best interest of the blockchain for us not only ignore and repute any futile attempts at oppressive regulation, but also to launch a progressive campaign in response to prevent their attempts and any future ones.
Thank you for your well prepared post describing the urgency of the situation in which we are faced with.

How did you determine the price of Storj coins before even determining what each gb is going to be worth on the Storj network? If you buy Storj coins then they are used to purchase storage space, yet there is no data explaining how much space one storj coin can get you? It doesn't seem like you can accurately predict what kind of space a storj coin could get because it's all going to be based on an assumption of the amount of people who use or participate in the network.
It seems like buying storj coins can be seen as a "risk" or even an investment. This kind of distorts the whole idea of storj and can cause manipulations in the price of storage. 
In the end it seems like someone will have setup the most efficient setup and there likely will be few key players in the network, much like the bitcoin mining game. Once that seems to take effect then the only difference I see is files being encrypted when stored, which someone could easily do with traditional services. 
Why did storj have to have it's own currency when it could have used Bitcoin (Bitcoin is programmable money).
Last random thought here. If there was any value to be had of computing resources or storage that consumers have laying around then why have large companies not bothered to try and develop a way to harness it? The only answer I can think of is that it just isn't a good idea.
Also what can Storj offer that SpiderOak.com doesn't? If you have specific price or numbers, please enlighten us.

The propaganda team (Big Brother &amp; Big Media) shit smeared his name and condemned him to the sheeple much like yourself. They've done a great job because whenever a person with an IQ comes along and questions this case and how it was conducted, the sheeple just start swarming.

They're not avoiding fraud, it's that simple.
If they are properly preventing fraud then they are as cumbersome and aggravating as Coinbase.
Also even if they don't prevent fraud, they still can get fucked with a chargeback 90 days later. No identity check figures out when the good person is going to go bad. Banks are more than happy to pull the money back from some silly bitcoin exchanger and put it back in their vault.

Doesn't someone have to be killed before you are labelled a murderer?
No matter your viewpoint on drugs or drug laws, Silkroad was making the world a safer place. They were reducing violent crime and allowing users to become more educated and aware about the illicit drugs they were using.
It's called "the lesser evil" theory.
Also, Ross was only providing a tool to the people, just as Bitcoin is a tool for the people. If you don't support a person's freedom of choice or free market then why are you wasting time here in ? Bitcoin is a tool for the people that is meant to disrupt and displace the power from the government and banks. The Silkroad is merely one example of all the freedom that Bitcoin brings to it's people and users.

@_date: 2014-07-08 09:47:35
I'll give you guys a little teaser.
CoinBase wanted to re-invent the whole Bitcoin wallet idea, so they came up with something that blows multi-sig and all that bullshit away.
You see, there are generally only 2 kinds of wallets, which both have resulted in a loss of ton of Bitcoin. You have Hot wallets and then Cold Wallets and sometimes even hot wallets that site owners tell you are cold wallets.
Coinbase is going the extra mile and is now offering... **drumroll**... icyhot wallets. 
WTF is an IcyHot wallet? I can't tell you everything, but I'll give you a few examples and use cases of where IcyHot wallets are superior.
Everyone has heard the story of where a user gets scammed and instantly knows it after doing a quick google search. It's the same story everytime.. Too good to be true, I was greedy, I hit the wrong keys, I copy pasted the wrong address, I downloaded porn and got malware, etc.
The main feature of the IcyHot Wallet is that it allows you to keep your Bitcoins safe and it does that by not trusting the owner that is operating the wallet because in the end, it is always the owners fault when he gets screwed. He clicked something at some point in time that either sent the coins or somehow let the coins become compromised. 
How does IcyHot Wallet do this? It's almost too simple. Whenever the owner of the wallet wishes to send or spend some Bitcoins they must enter a request for the exact amount and then wait 24 hours + a random interval anywhere from between +1 and +6 hours. So in order to process a transaction where you are sending bitcoins out, you must plan ahead (24 to 30 hours) and also confirm the transaction once again after the time has passed. If you attempt to access or spend the coins before the "Mature" date after initializing a request, then the counter is reset and an extra +3 hours are added onto it. If you start a transaction and then fail to follow up with the confirmation within 12 hours of the "Mature" date, then your wallet resets back to step 1 and also adds another +3 hours onto the next time you attempt to use it.
Well, shit that sounds like a pain in the ass. It sounds like that Wallet scheme might actually make me start planning my future purchases from random shady companies who are selling mining gear. This wallet scheme will help irrational users become rational. 
Let's just be honest with ourselves right now, there really isn't a  dire emergency for any Bitcoin transaction if you are a regular person. What does waiting 24 hours mean in the whole scheme of things if you know you are going to send it but just have to wait a little bit?
CoinBase has really outdone themselves with this wallet. I think they will be saving millions and millions of dollars for the average joe bitcoiner. This wallet is actually more effective than a true cold wallet because people are dumbasses and people use cold wallets. This wallet treats you like a dumbass so you learn not to be one.
