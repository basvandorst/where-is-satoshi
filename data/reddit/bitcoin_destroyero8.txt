Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme in the following way:
Early adoptors mined Bitcoin for practically nothing on their consumer CPUs/GPUs back in 2010/2011. These guys are at the top of the pyramid.
Then come those speculated on Bitcoin and bought it to higher prices. These guys are at the middle and bottom of the pyramid.
The early adoptors cash out millions for doing practically nothing, leaving the remaining many with crumbs to divide amongst themselves. Its a massive wealth transfer that is undeserved and deceptive (buyers were promised riches, but end up as bag holders). Therefore I suggest it is also fraudulent.
It functions exactly as a pyramid scheme. You seem to believe that pyramid schemes require conscious intention of every indivudual participating in it, which is false. This is why it is a crime to even participate in (I.e. be a victim of) a pyramid scheme. You will also find that in other exampled of pyramid schemes, most involved don't know that what they are participating in is a pyramid scheme - or simply refuse to think about it.
Bitcoin's increasing and extreme volatility, as well as need for centralized points of failure (exchanges), means it is disadvantageous to use as a medium of exchange. But even if you assume it is a good medium of exchange, the price is irrelevant - the price of a Bitcoin could be $0.01, and it could still work just as effectively as a medium of exchange. Except of course that miners will not mine at the price, meaning the pyramid scheme has to continue drawing in infinite buyers, or the network comes to a standstill and effectively dies.
I do not know for certain that an altcoin will replace Bitcoin, but I do know that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme and it can only resolve in one way in the end - make no mistake, it will die. Whether it will die because confidence is lost, or because the network fails to work, that is up for discussion.
