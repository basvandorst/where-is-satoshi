This is the issue with ALL exchanges...wish I had more money to put in right now. With this new blood in the crypto world, things may go down short term, but mid and long term, WE ARE GONNA BE RICH!!!  
Tl;DR - Its a good problem to have...a lot of these newbies are making us RICH!!!

LOL! Wow you just tried to establish a characteristic of Bitcoin...and failed.  
Bitcoin is a currency, a commodity....to be exchanged.  
Everyone sells, after a year, a decade or whenever. If he/she does not, he/she dies without enjoying the benefits of the riches Bitcoin brings. 
If you were hodling, you have lesser than the BTC than you had in the morning, and I have almost 15% more.  
Be happy with what you have, but DO  try not to redefine Bitcoin.

And a true trader already sold earlier in the day to buy low.  
Hodling is the safest thing to do, not the smartest.

If only I had more to buy!!!

I am seeing a fair number of new Mods in the trollbox, suggesting that they are indeed adding new staff. Although I am done with Polo after their last DDoS, I dont think there is any conspiracy here, and their letter seems fair.
