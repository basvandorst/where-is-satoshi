Yes it's very possible, but with almost immediate rebound, you can lose alot of money shorting.  It's far easier to gain by going long, in my experience.

Shorting BTC at current growth rate is suicidal, imo.  Yesterday, a couple of friends asked me about bitcoin while we were out drinking and everyone at the table was deeply interested.  This would not have happened even a month ago.  Today, I saw an advertisement on a bus for a bitcoin exchange and they were talking about bitcoin on radio station at the same time. (I am in Korea) This thing is spreading like a plague.

The price is moving.

This can't just be "alot of new people."  buying trend seems very different than previous occasions.

just wait until asia wakes up.

How can it not be Ledger's fault when I selected high fee for fast transaction?  The transaction was sent with fee of "0.0000844 BTC" which is lower than the test transaction with same "high fee for fast transaction" selected.

test transaction was sent with fee of 0.00026568 BTC btw.  :(

I just prefer to have BTC.  Not really into alts.

I've used BTC.COM accelerator service.  ViaBTC.com is offering free service but it's queued too fast with limited availability.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:28:20
How much?  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:16:00
I believe this is normal in this "early" stage.  As price stabilizes and more bitcoin spending options are available, things will change.  For now, almost everyone is in this for potential increase in value.

This is a great news.

We are in take off phase. :P

maybe try to be more realistic.  dump will affect lots of people. esp noobs. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:50:36
My guess is that it will bounce back.

There will be initial shorting, but shorting a limited supply asset with no target price is a very dangerous thing (suicidal imo).  Shorting with leverage, alot of people will go bankrupt if BTC hits even $15,000.

Okay, I got it solved.
I don't know how the fee was set to 0.0000844 BTC, but it was stuck for good.  Tried VIA Accelerator but minimum requirement for transaction was fee with 0.0001BTC/KB, so it was basically no go and it was all queued up.  So my only choice was BTC.COM.  I had to pay $100.00 USD for that process including buying Bcash to pay for the service.  After BTC.COM accelerator paid for, the transaction processed in less than 15 mins.  I am no longer using Ledger until I hear from someone from the support.  I don't want to disclose but it was alot of money and freaked me out pretty good. :q

Start buying in increment.

My test transaction was sent with fee of 0.00026568 BTC.  Higher than the later transaction.  I just don't understand how this could happen.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:27:51
really disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:41:35
True, but there's always the opposing force.

I am a Korean, and will explain the situation bit more.  The government imposed a ban that prevents any new money to flow into crypto exchanges.  Everyone who already has an account on an exchange has to set up a new verified bank account to transfer money to and from an exchange, effective Jan. 30th.  All new users are banned from opening a new account on an exchange, effective Dec. twentysomething.  So no new money from new adopters, and limited and regulated money from old users.
