Bitcoin Core is dedicated to PoW whereas Vitalik realizes we need to do PoS to be more eco-friendly.
I think the idea of digital gold is a fallacy. Gold was the one place people could turn to and trust in. With crypto you don't need trust at all. So we don't need digital gold. I'm sure a crypto like Dai, or a coin holding a basket of stable currencies 1:1 will be a better solution to holding wealth at a stable rate. More likely though I think people will want to let that money earn interest. Something BTC can't do. I think most money will be held in coins facilitating lending. With everything automated, and open source, it's basically guaranteed interest, so why wouldn't people hold their money in that? If they are paranoid, they'd be able to buy insurance.

Who's doing the work of LN?
I know miners will be opening and closing channels, but who's doing the other work?
What happens when someone "pulls out" of a LN transaction? Do the other people in that channel have to reconnect? Or will the apps do this automatically? What does the end user see? A delay?

Capitalism will crush itself due to free market pressures. Making way for futurachy. The free market will still funnel cash into decentralized currencies due to the profit potential. A ban would be phenomenal for my bottom line. Once apps and services come out utilizing crypto and price-cutting the competition, of course users would follow.
There's no real way to even ban apps from using crypto.

Paypal limited my account for absolutely no reason and when I try to email them asking on why, they give me a pre-rendered email that doesn't even apply to me (something about a limitation checklist, when I don't have one), with an email address I can't even reply to.
I hope you know you work for a shit company, owned by a shit company (eBay did the exact same thing to me, I'm still confused why, when I had no negative feedback, always fulfilled my orders, and was courteous with customers, the only reason why I wasn't powerseller was because I didn't offer refunds do to the software having product keys they can use and send back, and there's tons of people on the internet talking about how they lost their eBay business for no reason at all).

 From the comments:
I accept that language changes and evolves- that's fine, that's good. Sometimes we need new words when the ones we have are inadequate. However, aside from "actually" (which does not have the impact of "literally"), I can't think of any real synonyms to "literally". How can I mean a word that doesn't mean what it means? 
If we really are going to accept this definition, fine. But then how do we express "literally?" What word can I use instead? You're the dictionary, MW, so maybe you can suggest something, because right now, we have NO WORD in our language that means what "literally" used to mean. This is the opposite of adding to our vocabulary. It's like irony- there is no other word for it, so if we lose that one, we lose the ability to express the meaning it represents.
Of course people can use both meanings, but if common usage becomes one, how will someone know you mean the other? For example, if I call a friend and say "can you come help me? I was watching Parks &amp; Rec and literally busted my gut from laughing" they are not going to understand that I need a ride to the hospital immediately. That's a silly example, yes, but until recently, "literally" was used to denote when something you said that sounds figurative or rhetorial was actually meant... well, literally (and no, I'm not arguing that that's its original or "purest" definition). Now, if I want to express the same thought, I have to say "I literally busted my gut. As in, I actually did. Like, I have broken ribs right now, and am bleeding. I am not joking, I literally need to go the hospital. I swear I'm being totally serious- I know it sounds like a common expression, but I LITERALLY- I mean, not figuratively- damaged my abdomen." Because the word "literally" won't cut it any more.

Can we have a debate between BTC &amp; ETH as it concerns future-proofing?
There are three fundamental differences I would like to understand the logic of for both projects.
1.) PoW vs. PoS
Is PoW or PoS better for a layer 2 solution? I believe layer 2 is the future, and will be how blockchain scales. It seems both BTC and ETH agree on that, yet one prefers PoW for security and the other prefers PoS, respectively. 
So what's more secure in your opinion?
I know PoW uses more energy and costs more, but if 99.9999% of transactions will be occurring off-chain, then that doesn't matter so much, does it? So shouldn't the question be mostly about security? Is PoS also more secure? If so, what is the argument on the other side?
2.) VM on layer 1 vs. layer 2
What are the pros and cons of having a VM on layer 1 as in ETH compared to layer 2 as in BTC? Does it make ETH more complicated than it needs to be for the base layer? Will that affect future development? If so, what is the argument on the other side?
3.) Deflationary vs. Inflationary
As I understand it, BTC wants "money" to be on the base layer as it will make layer 2 more secure, whereas ETH wants "money" to be on layer 2, which could very well be deflationary, even if the base layer is not. Is the uncertainly of the supply of ether a problem for a base layer? I know Vitalik has been thinking a lot about this from Twitter, but I don't have a clear picture on the pros vs. cons of this to make up my own mind. What arguments are being thrown around here?
I do feel like this uncertainty in supply is weird, because how can anyone plan for the future when the supply is so uncertain? Are there any benefits to the uncertainty, does it not matter, or is this definitely going to be addressed in the near future?
If Ether ends up having no value, as the essay titled, "Why Ether will eventually be worth zero," asserts, and which I agree with (arbitrarily creating fees for using an open source protocol will be competed away in a free market, and Ether doesn't need to have value for the network to be secure, because miners will likely accept other digital currencies, including money developed on Layer 2), then the supply of Ether doesn't matter, right? Just want to make sure I'm thinking this through.
I'm looking for well-reasoned arguments for or against a position, where it is clear you have researched both sides and understand the arguments against most of what you're saying, but also have counter-arguments for them.

As for that last quote:
There's two competing ideologies. One that says your consciousness is immortal, and the other that says it's only an illusion. If it's the former, who cares if someone said your name for the last time. Humans would be like ants to you, if even that. You might not care what happens on Earth at all. Or your memory would be wiped. If it's the latter, nothing really matters anyway. In both cases, it's a case of humans thinking they are more important than they really are.
Oh, boo hoo, you were forgotten to history like *everyone* will be eventually. No one cares. The universe doesn't care.
It's a non-event.
This seems nihilistic, but I care about what happens when I'm alive, not after I'm dead, becuase either way I know I won't care about any of it after I'm dead, so why should I care about it now?
It's a weird psychological trick our brains play on us that's not rooted in logic.
I know it's a quote that tries to get people to do the right thing so that their name somehow lives on, but I think even the concept of karma or a judgement day would be a lot more effective.
Sorry if I'm getting too deep or technical.

If they wanted to destroy BTC they would have 51% attacked it in its early stages. If they wanted to destroy BTC they would have banned it when it was still associated with drugs and other illegal activity. Giving it good PR like this would be counter-productive to that end.
Say there's someone you like, but they like someone else. If your goal is for them to come to you instead of the other person, why would part of your plan be to say how great that other person is and loudly shout it from the rooftops? There's no sense in that.
What makes more sense is that everyone in the government has their own opinion and this is this one person's opinion. If there was a marching order to not support blockchain, they wouldn't have made these comments, or they would be out of a job right now. Which means, as much as you believe it can't be so, there simply isn't a marching order against blockchain in the government. Most people in government are as clueless as the average person is about this tech.
As for the central bankers, maybe they realize they can't stop progress? Maybe they realize the gig is up and it was good while it lasted? Maybe they have enough money and they just want to hide away before the masses come after them? Maybe they realize that making the economy more efficient will benefit them more than trying to make more and more money? A rising tide floats all boats. (Would you rather be a middle class Anerican or a 14th century King?)
I don't think money is very important to people who already have billions. I think most billionaires couldn't care less about making more money. Maybe they want to retain their status and lifestyle and protect themselves from an angry mob of people who will take that away (Russian Oligarchs), maybe they want fame (celebrities), maybe they want power (dictators), maybe they want to make a difference (Bill Gates), maybe they want their family business to succeed (Waltons), maybe they want to impose their political views on the world (Coke/Mercer), but money is just a means to an end in order to do these things. But a secret canal of people who use their untold amounts of money in order to accrue more money? Just for the heck of it? Nah, I don't buy that.
Plus, the CFTC is not the central bankers. If bankers have a plan to destroy BTC, they sure as hell wouldn't risk it by telling an actual government agency. Snowden happens. Whistleblowers happen. Leaks happen.
The problem as I see it is that there are two views of the government. It's incompetent accidentally vs. on purpose. I side on Occam's Razor here. George Carlin famously said, "Think of how stupid the average person is. Now realize half of us are even stupider than that."
I don't see any evidence that there's a worldwide cabal that controls things. So either they're just that good at keeping a secret, which means they have to be hella smart to think of ALL the ways they could be busted, or there's no such thing.
I do believe there are wealthy, power hungry individuals, but I don't believe they organize together, or that they are playing a massive game of 4D chess. And there's whistleblowers and leaks that come out of those that do organize, such as the Russian oligarchs who control Putin. We know that becuase it's nearly impossible to keep such secrets, and even among these people there are different factions and people who disagree with one another. They aren't united. Because that's how humans are.
And again, if they were that smart, they would have seen Bitcoin as a threat since its inception. If they were that smart they would have been on the lookout for the internet providing such a possibility and been subscribed to the cypherpunk's newsletter so that they could nip it in the bud.
None of this adds up.
As for FedCoin, the USD and fiat in general should have been digital a long time ago. Yes, it will be a central database, but if it's open source and can interact other blockchains, it will still be a huge step up.
If the Fed promises that it will uphold any transaction that isn't illegal, and there is cryptographic proof of any wrongdoing, and everything is open source, then it will be very useful for many use cases. I don't like how most countries make laws and I don't like who most people elect as their representatives, so I can't say I would use it, but it would still be an upgrade, and perhaps a stepping stone for a more decentralized solution. I'd say it's somewhere in-between a generic database and a decentralized blockchain. At least there's transparency and accountability involved. I wonder how it would keep up with technological advancements though.
I'm going to need you to explain your 4th paragraph some more.
No one has enough money to artificially hold up or hold down any asset's price. Great-freakin-Britain tried doing that and failed miserably, with all of their money. Next you're going to say that was all planned too. With no leaks.
It's too far fetched.
Bitcoin's price is not only based on speculation, that's just part of it. It also has a use-case, and its price is strongly correlated with the number of transactions that occur using the protocol. If there's a need to send money using Bitcoin, no artificial market manipulation will keep it down. It's simply needed. If you attempt to manipulate it, you will only end up losing money, just like Great Britain.
The US government loses money every day trying to keep the price of corn down artificially through subsidies. You don't expect to try and manipulate the free market and come out ahead. You do it expecting to lose.
Of course you can manipulate traders and speculators using sell walls and such, but that's short-term, not longterm, and it only affects speculators and traders. If you truly need Bitcoin, the price doesn't bother you, you need it regardless.

Hasn't your life been made easier by having technology like electricity, stoves, microwaves, refrigerators, air conditioners? All of these inventions have put people out of work, but can you sit here and argue that we'd be better off living in the Stone Age? 
Would we be discussing this without the internet? Technology has only made my life better. I wouldn't want to be living 1000, 100, or even just 10 years ago. Would you?
I fully expect my job to be replaced by creative destruction, and in fact, I am spending my own money to make that happen, so I can start learning to do other things humans need, like maybe creating new medicine or ending poverty.
Think of the economy on a small scale so that it's easier to digest. A commune is a small economy, with everyone having their own job or chores to do. Imagine you spend 7 hours per day feeding the animals and Bob spends 2 hours washing all of the dishes, + 5 hours cooking. Introduce technology. Add a washing machine. Now Bob can take 1 of those ~2 hours he's saving and maybe help you feed the animals. Your life is easier because now you're only spending 6~ hours a day feeding the animals. Yes, Bob will have to learn his new job, but he's *also* saving 1 hour on chores. This is what technology does. It's only ever good.
As a side note, as I've said, we need to do a better job educating and retraining people. Wouldn't you take 50 hours or whatever to train Bob on how to feed the animals if it meant saving 1 hour everyday after Bob is trained? Of course. As a society we need to spend less on war and more on education. But one of the drawbacks of a large economic system like ours is that people can't see the good education does, or how it benefits them directly. It's all indirect.
You talk about my job being replaced. If you make just $30,000 USD per year, it puts you in the top 1% of the world's population by purchasing power. That's adjusted for things like cost of living. Living in the Western world in this modern era is the luckiest thing to happen to any of us, and even though it may seem like your world has collapsed by losing your job, in the grand scheme of things, you're still incredibly lucky to have easy access to a wealth of knowledge never before seen, right on the internet, in order to learn many new careers. And getting a new job is easy enough in this economy, with there being a shortage of labor in construction, healthcare, and transportation, at least in America, not sure about elsewhere. You have to be grateful for what you have and realize just how good you have it.
Meanwhile, technological innovations have lifted millions upon millions of people out of poverty and ended many sickness and suffering. 
I wonder whether you'd still feel the same if you needed a polio vaccine before you die from it, or if solar power would allow you to eat twice a week instead of once a week, right?
Blockchain technology can improve the lives and end the suffering of millions.
Tl;dr Technology allows us to work less, overall. This will bring millions out of poverty and allow us to cure many/most/all illnesses and causes of suffering. I can't wait until all of my needs are taken care of, and I am free to do whatever I want. That means work, or play. Whatever makes you happy.
P.S. There's nothing wrong with learning how to cook or going for a walk. ;)

Capitalism and Socialism will converge into a peer to peer decentralized free market owned by everyone.

How do you sign up for regulation when your organisation is totally decentralized, with no one to answer to? Doesn't make sense to me.
There are some ICOs already showing working products, which is a nice improvement.
I don't see how it's any different from Kickstarters.

Trust me, some are.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:46:40
I think decentralization is valuable to a niche group of people, not to the masses, sadly.
Government will always want control, so if a decentralized crypto becomes too valuable, government will ban it. It will still be used, as it can never be completely banned, but it can't gain mass adoption.
I can see stablecoins being used in developing countries, so that can be huge.
If Russia develops its own coin, then other countries will follow.
Even if you remove malicious intent by the powers that be, there's good reason for governments to regulate crypto, such as illegal activity.
I'm not smart enough to know, but I do know there are some debated monetary policies where you debt is not a significant problem. So that could be one reason why a government would want more control.
I do think that it's in everyone's best interest for people to trust in their currency, and fiat is not doing that.
I think a bigger revolution is in things like DAOs, open source technology, and perhaps DAG tech, which seems like a better blockchain.
When that gets rolling I think we can see something like an open source monetary policy ruled by consensus algorithms, which can be audited and improved by a governance system. Hopefully that will be a more trustworthy way of doing monetary policy.

I think most people are looking for a return on investment from the token at least and some ICOs provide dividends to attract investors. There's no equity stake because there's no business to own or sell. Like they said, right now not all ICOs are decentralised, but that's how it should be. Decentralized and open source. So anyone can contribute to a project at any time and in any amount. As long as people believe in the project, it can be worked on.

I know people don't like changing things when they think math should be the rules, but I think that's unrealistic. I don't know what the downside is to preventing bad actors.
What's the difference between what ETH did and, say, finding a bug in the software and fixing it? I see no difference.
My personal ideology would be behind ETH. I would trust a coin more if they were committed to not letting bugs and exploits remove my money. As long as it's only bugs and exploits.
Perhaps these ideologues are trying to make a slippery slope argument, which is never logically sound.

So will you sell your Bitcoins if offchain solutions become centralised?
Core wants to make BTC into a settlement layer. Fees will skyrocket if BTC stays at 1MB (or 2-something MB with SegWit if you want to be technical), meaning only offchain solutions will be feasible, which can lead to centralisation.

4. You make it seem like the current Internet is a role model we should strive for, when there's efforts going on trying to decentralize the Internet itself, like SkyCoin, because they don't like how the Internet is so centralized.
Blockchain technology and smart contracts will revolutionize the world though. Really, the world will be completely different when it catches on. Think about things like DAOs and such. Businesses and governments will never be the same. Everything will run much more efficiently and securely. The open source revolution will cause everyone to share more information and software, to be audited by everyone, and everyone will have a voice.

I think it's approaching the point of missing the boat. If governments ban untraceable crypto due to legal issues, only those interested in decentralization and those doing illegal things will use it. I read an article that stated if all illegal trade went to Bitcoin, it would be around $5,000. I don't think ALL illegal trade will be on Bitcoin, so take some away, but give some from anti-government ideologues, and I think we will see the price settle around 5K - 10K in the end.

1. Competing for control is a bad idea for an open source project. If big enough group of people don't approve of what you're doing, they fork, as you're seeing now. I see this simply as a difference of opinion in how BTC should be run. It's not about control.
2. I don't know what the motives are for Core, but I do know they have a private slack channel which a moderator of this sun is included in. Why would a group of independent volunteer coders need to be friends with a subreddit moderator? They should be focused on coding. It seems like there is some political war they are fighting. I don't know what their agenda is. I do believe all groups believe in the currency and value of the project, but perhaps it's getting to some people's head.
3. You haven't really explained at all how Core comes to final decisions.
4. I believe the blockchain or DAG technology is more important than Bitcoin. There's a reason why governments and private banks are interested in it, and they have no interest in decentralizing it.

I think the logic is pretty simple. Early adopters obviously gain the most. BTC has already made millionaires from zero. Imagine if the governor of Ohio bought all Ohioians some shares of Google in 1999. When Google gained market share, Ohioians would benefit.

If they stole a cake, why is the BTC chain still operating? If they stole it, the BTC chain would be gone. That's not an apt analogy at all.
It seems you're arguing copyright law or something. What it would be licensed as. Creative Commons, etc.
Many people take Wikipedia articles and sell them in books completely legally. They clone Wikipedia as well legally.

How I understood it, the vulnerability was there but it was only supposed to be temporary. It was to prevent scam clones of IOTA, but since the info got out, they took that part out, so it's no longer vulnerable and hasn't been for months.
A weird judgement call, but it's irrelevant now.
What do you mean home-roll crypto?

How does LN make sure transactions go where they need to go when channels can open and close all of the time? 
Can you use an example of a train on tracks? 
How will the train get to its destination if the tracks can suddenly close and derail the train?

Let's not assume we know what consciousness is.
Also I doubt any AI will be created that has no hard and fast rules about what it's supposed to do and not do. We will create AI to learn about specific fields of interest, not a general AI to just let loose on the world and say, "let's see what it does!"
Also, machines connected to the internet would need to have significant control over our lives for any AI to cause apocalypse.
Lastly, correct me if I'm wrong, but quantum communication is supposed to be unhackable, so not even a super AI can hack it, theoretically. Unless it's so advanced it does something we could never have conceived of. But we could go anywhere with that. It could create a wormhole for demons from another dimension to come through, too...anything is possible, but let's not go down that rabbit hole.

Keep telling yourself that. Core is the one that's bought.

There's less risk, less reward because video card companies have a bigger market than crypto.
PoW is obviously not sustainable though, so yes, he doesn't know what he's saying.

There's good unanswered responses to him in that very thread though. I don't think copying an answer from a dev is good enough. Perhaps some analytical and respected independent thinker or even a debate.
Here's a good thread from that link:

Should've just bought $10. A good risk/reward ratio right there. Just a couple lunches at most.
Don't make the same mistake with good altcoins like OMG.

I don't know, wouldn't the coin with the highest market cap be Bitcoin?

I'm sick of your condescending attitude to anyone with a different opinion than you. Remember that debating people on reddit is mostly for the reader and not the person you're replying to. If you want to best represent your side, you shouldn't split hairs. It will also help you not to get hypertension.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:30:58
Right. If they understood economics, BTC would be a lot higher.

This makes me sick.

How can they force you to turn over something you claim to not have any more? I mean, they can hire a P.I. or something, but if the investigation turns up nothing, they can't say you have it.

Nearly all economists agree that we don't want to use a deflationary currency because pay wage is "sticky". Think about it. You wouldn't like a cut in your wage, even if it's actually an increase, but due to deflation it looks like a cut.
Also inflation helps create capital because holding money and not doing anything with it is not preferable. You want it being lent out or spent. You can't expect to just hold it and it still retain the same value or even more value. If I get paid $5 for mowing a lawn in 1950, it wouldn't make sense for me to have an equivalent of $5000 now. It was the same amount of work.

Depends how foreigners are treated. In urban US and Canada, I don't they they are treated differently at all. I actually think it's more endearing. I'd take a random foreign friend over a random local friend if I had to pick. Can't speak for elsewhere.

By that logic you can make $1 and go on your way happy about being a winner, no?
How does lost opportunity not factor into your mindset?

Just a hypothetical, I'm not getting at anything here, but what if there was a drug that caused people to go on murder-sprees? Would we ban that? How would we deal with it?

Selling anywhere except the absolute peak of all time locks in a loss when you think about it. One of the reasons why I hate the concept of investment as a perfectionist. You're always a loser.

But we'd be treating the symptoms and not the cause.

It's just semantics at this point. The point is that there's a good chance to always feel awful once you invest in anything.

If you eat breakfast now you might end up in space without a helmet.

There's no guarantee of that, so you're gambling. I would say just never lock in a loss and you'll be okay.
