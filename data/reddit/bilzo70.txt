It's not going down,  you missed the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:04:01
I'm all in on BCH, it's the real Bitcoin.  ROTFLMFAO

I know a CEO that smokes weed daily. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:28:54
A real possibility with ETF approval. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:05:37
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:50:38
You nailed it.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:00:30
We had a bull run last year with more than 40 different crypto currencies. Why would we need less for the next bull run?
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:04:18
Best crypto currency comment I’ve read in months. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:49:09
When it’s at $100k people will look back and wonder why they didn’t sell their house to jump in at $18k.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:35:09
Look at how ETFs have supressed the price of gold and silver. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:07:29
Trend analysis shows its about to seriously pick up.
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:14:38
They’ve been sending out Tweets, and iirc they’re supposed to be up and running in November of this year.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:51:07
Plausible and a great way to test security.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:05:21
It depends on the ETF approval. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:09:41
When it bounces back up to  $20k will you hope for  $30k? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:45:01
LOL, “it’s not a lie if you believe it”
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:11:18
It's not going to $4700.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:16:01
Will a BullWhale disrupt TA? You betcha!
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:46:23
And every time I have enough fiat to jump back in, it drops 2% right after I pull the trigger.
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:19:44
It’s FUD and total bs.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:53:37
No, he recently doubled down and said Bitcoin will get to $1M by 2020.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:14:28
It’s just bull.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:47:56
This could be the spark that ignites a wildfire. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:14:44
It was a Tweet sent last week or week before last. Also here’s an article from February of this year.
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:08:58
USAA is planning on offering similar services for crypto investing as they currently are doing for stocks.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:15:18
Technically he tripled down if you include his recent tweet.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:59:32
Its just money.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:00:15
ROTFLMFAO

Is that the optional Rektometer?
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:44:38
Only put half of it in. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:58:25
This trash is and has made a lot of people rich.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:18:48
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING

That banking system hasn’t been doing so well since 1913.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:14:15
In a distasteful world.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:11:03
Hmmmm, he’s gonna be dining on some wrinkled old dick.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:13:53
Lol, my thought as well.
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:21:00
Time to BTFD
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:09:18
Wait a few weeks.
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:59:35
Right now I’d be heavily invested in Litecoin until the halving.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:44:47
Far better than what any bank holds percentage wise.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:12:02
Jumping from $4200 to $5400 wasn’t interesting?
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:20:06
This amount of tether correlates to every major run in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:26:51
$300 million in new tether says it’s possible by next week.
@_date: 2019-04-30 06:40:31
He posted he was kidding after that, he’s just fucking with people. Relax.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:07:24
What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:46:16
For long term, yes hodl.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:24:23
You must be a noob, Litecoin is in a halving year.  Most expect it to be around  $180 by June or July. BTW it didn't drop that much during the tether FUD, only about 4%.
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:26:25
People are moving into Bitcoin riding it up to $6k. After they profit they'll go back into alts.
@_date: 2019-04-21 19:45:27
Litcoin actually.
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:25:49
I know right?
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:20:11
The real Satoshi wouldn't be running around saying he's Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:52:26
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:52:58
Will you still be unhappy when it reaches its next ATH?  
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:50:13
Yes, Bitcoin 2 AKA BCash, is dead and split into to more worthless shitcoins Bitcoin 3 and 4.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:35:56
Prolly due to skidding sideways for weeks. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:33:34
Move it to Litecoin and zooom!
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:39:12

I read somewhere LN was in use now.

Hello from the outside.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:24:35
I've never had that problem on coinbase.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:16:44
I don’t think they want it destroyed but rather capped and manipulated. There’s too much money to be made with Bitcoin to lose it.
@_date: 2018-11-10 14:06:25
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:33:11
I'm waiting but not expecting anything big until at least a year from now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:04:12

Who worships him? Nobody really knows who it is or even if it’s a person and not a group. LOL

I promise you someone will lose their mind when the power bill goes way above normal cost and useage. Bad idea don't do it.

You can tie in PayPal to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:48:36
Won’t happen, if it did it would immediately negate all previous historical data and begin anew.

I feel like Marty McFly right now holding Gray's Sports Almanac 1950-2021.

Tesla makes a great fire to get warm next to.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:11:15
Not a bad entry for a long term HODL. That being said, don’t freak out and sell if we drop to $2k.
