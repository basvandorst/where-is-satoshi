i guess  i understand it from that point of view as i did just make an address, however
lets use a real world example, how can i pay, YOU 5 BTC from within the bitcoin core app if i currently have 0btc?  how do i buy it and transfer it to this bitcoin wallet

fair point with the buying fractional BTC
hard to call the market but do you think its overdue for a pullback?  I kinda feel like it is but hard to measure something I relatively am still new to
is it safe to assume that if i buy BTC with a currency - my currency is technically on their 'exchange' (similar to owning a stock)
and if i get paid with BTC on Bitcoin Core , if this computer dies .... RIP bitcoins
any good way to backup the wallet?

im with you every step of the way, but you lost me at seeding a 12 word phrase
also if i buy BTC on the exchange but dont wanna leave big amounts, how can i send it to my own BTC private address on the bitcoin app?

ok.  it'll prob be a good day or so
next question would be how can you send without buying?  i dont see anywhere within the app to add payment instructions such as credit card / banking
in the meantime, im all setup with coinbase and have an address, just have not tried to do anything yet
any cool iphone apps i can use on my phone that arent complete shit?   I just bought 1 litecoin (it's the cheapest at around 40 bucks)
