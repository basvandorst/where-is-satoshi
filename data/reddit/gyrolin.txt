It's also absurd for the people who were here for the April crash. The people who didn't sell (because why would you) are in much better shape regardless of what BTC did today.

I wouldn't feel too bad. The currency was bound to fluctuate as heavily as it did in gain. The fact remains that the price will inevitably go back up to 260 and above barring government intervention or a competing technology.

If you made an account just to post that, I think you did a good thing today.

I love how OP made a new account just to post specifically this.

You just lost 1000 dollars because you made a poor investment. Take some responibility, yeah?

Did you make an account just to fear monger and spread personal desire for a reserve based on hindsight? ISHYGDDT

The trouble is their Beta risk (Risk related to the market) is relatively the same. If one takes a hit the other is going to as well unless it is related to adaptation, use, or bugs in one of them in particular. It's not exactly diversification to have a portfolio 50% BTC 50% LTC.

I really don't think so. You see, until there is some news that is negative for bitcoins, we are going to see them continually increase in value as the public gets more comfortable with it.

Let's fucking hope so.
@_date: 2013-08-15 05:39:26
I'm optimistic, but I'm banking it it stabilizing around $5,000. Your estimates are a bit too high imo.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:55:36
While this is ridiculous... It's pretty funny.
