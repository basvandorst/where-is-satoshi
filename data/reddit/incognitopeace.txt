I never said that you must be stupid.

This is considered capital gain.

I agree bitcoin use is not mainstream at all. The investment into it is going mainstream. The question is if there is a mainstream investment into something that doesn’t have mainstream use what happens?

When everyone in this sub starts saying bitcoin is about to short or is in a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:58:28
Someone more experienced may correct me but I don’t think Java is the core language used in the Blockchain technology. I believe bitcoin was written in c++ and ethereum uses solidity and c++. If you are thinking of writing smart contracts on the ethereum chain then you may want to learn solidity.

If you use gdax and transfer money from your bank to gdax and buy bitcoin there is no fees. Downside is you will have to get verified which means ur not anonymous to your government. Also it’s like a 5 day wait time for money to clear bank and be In gdax.

Why do people do 430$ and not the proper way $430. Is this some non us way of doing things?

Buy a mountain with $200 worth of bitcoin? Who taught you math?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:26:23
I go against the FUD worked out so far. If people are saying bitcoin is going to crash I buy. If people start saying moon moon I sell. Here’s an example when we hit 19,000 everyone on Reddit was yelling moon moon lambo lambo. I sold and rebought at 14500.

It’s such a gray area that some of these questions are very difficult to answer. If you were cashing out I would say yes you tax the difference of when you invested vs when you cashed out. In this situation since prices change I think you have to add up the different price points of bitcoin when you bought each good. In general it doesn’t matter if it doubled or tripled you always pay the value at which you go from bitcoin to usd or in your case sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:00:49
You can’t assume anything ever with bitcoin.

3 pm pacific you mean.

I think he’s comparing the unjust system of rich paying less than middle class / poor % wise. Which is indeed stupid but hey can’t change anything.

MySpace was first yet Facebook dominated. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:56:50
And you guys write dollars the same way?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:05:16
Start with emails. More specifically search keywords like “bitcoin” or “exchange” in your email search section. If you bought it you probably got it from an exchange so it would be easier to access than say a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:29:58
I don’t know how people can be so stupid. It happens every time. The funny thing is it actually works and the whales end up shaking these fearful noobs.

That’s going to be midnight CET 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:18:22
Already happened.. why post this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:32:06
Agreed, although I don’t understand how it came down to trump vs Hillary. What about old timer Bernie? xD
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:21:58
Why good luck? This is a decentralized market.. tell me exactly what the gov can do to him? He can sell his bitcoin for cash on the street. How will anyone ever know how much bitcoin he has if any at all?

I will sell one of my healthy kidneys for this dip. Any buyers?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:59:53
You’re an idiot, use better wording if “maintenance” is all you are trying to say. You didn’t have to say FUD that it’s spiraling are you a moron?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:10
I like you :) xD

I’m talking about the super bitcoin that was just about to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:50:19
I can tell you three things. The price will either hover at what it’s currently at, drop, or rise. 
Sorry for what happened at least you learned a lesson.

I heard congress are pressing hard against that vote to happen, and even if it does they want to revoke it. Remember Congress &gt;FCC.

What about birth certificate can you use that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:40:00
Makes Sense.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:03:57
So what happens in this sub when bitcoin drops??
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:09:31
Expect to feel even worse when it drops below 2,000. Oh you fool how did you not see this coming. Advice time: just hold don't sell anything long term you will see gains.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:23:30
You only lose if you are selling. Long term investors won't lose its the people who profit from short term investing who should be panicking. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:12:06
He has a wise point you delusional freaks.
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:39:20
Yes but don't forget when China decides to dump you holding won't matter to the price.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:50:15
Freakstyle brought up a good point. Anytime there is innovation in technology the average consumer has no idea what is going on. There will be people who create a bridge and security standards between us and the standard users. Just like banks did when dollars could be deposited electronically and paperless payment methods were introduced. 
Coinbase is a good example of going in the right direction by backing up stolen goods just as a bank would. My question to you op is do you really think people don't get scammed, hacked, and credit card fraud attempts in the real world?
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:07:52
You sir are retarded.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:15:31
I take it back. You complete me.

Both Fiat and bitcoin have risk. That being said sure dollar might stay the same or become inflated but it sure won't go the opposite way with the government. On the other hand bitcoin is capped and the risk to reward is a lot lower. I can one day wake up and 1 bitcoin could be worth $300 more than the prior day (150 more milk cartons than you could buy with fiat just sitting there. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:17:50
Yet huge mining companies and such do hold power in bitcoin. If not we wouldn't be having this issue of august 1st and the growth of bitcoin would of already been on a different level.
