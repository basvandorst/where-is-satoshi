These are very good points.  I was referring to safe from a, steal your key perspective.  But, attacking the tx spending through aliasing the intended recipient in the background and sending the fake tx to the ledger could possibly be a vector if one uses an unsigned / untrusted wallet or some other exploits are used to MITM wallet/ledger communication.

FDIC would probably get bailed out... yes.  But, technically it's not unlimited insurance.  If there is contagion,you will not get all of your funds out.  Also, internet thefts of bank money are not insured, just bankruptcies and deficiencies of banks to pay back are.  And, federal bail ins could still happen as is the suggested method of rebalancing liabilities for public debt in extreme circumstances by the IMF.  Also, FDIC and SPIC are limited in amount and scope.

Actually I think BitFinex has a Bitgo console they use to set automatic auth limits and manually authenticate large transactions.  If the attacker compromised enough servers to get BitFinex's keys, then they would probably also have access to the BitGo console to increase automated limits or to remove them completely.

The question is.... will some merchants or exchanges black list those coins completely due to their requirements to not facilitate money laundering?
Because if that could happen, you are an idiot to mix your coins in the same places that this guy is mixing his on a 1:1 basis.  You should be earning some type of risk premium for laundering tainted money.  In fact, this guy should probably run a bitcoin dice site with 51% + payouts to everyone else and the house only gets 49% or something.

But, I was just stating it as sarcasm.  That's actually the BTC value, not the number of txs.  Though, since the blockchain is public and the BFX hack addresses are supposed to be "known" then you can just pull all the tx's out from the corresponding blocks from the time of the hack til it was done and count them individually in a block explorer.

Umm...sure.  But, seriously.  It's a trivial change to require the 2fa token to remove it.  Yet, Kraken keeps making silly excuses about it with workarounds that are not very helpful.
It's not immediately obvious that you can take 2fa off of withdrawals or trading without 2fa.

You are referring the ledger classic nano which technically could partially succumb to this attack you are referring to, except that it comes with a multifactor authentication itself.  Either via confirmation on a mobile device or via a printed code card that's unique.  Please stop spreading FUD.  I own both and think they are great in their own ways.  The NFC ledger is multifactor and the new Nano S has a screen.  All of them do hardware key signing so it's 100% secure.  Not any less secure than your trezor.  Oh, btw, the original ledgers had a feature that Ledger doesn't have which I love and the reason I keep my cold storage there and not on the trezor.  If you enter an incorrect pin more than 3 or 5 times (i forget exactly) it erases the device.

If you only have 2FA on trading and withdrawals, and not on login, you are under the impression that no one can trade or withdraw from your account without 2FA.  However, that's now how it's programmed.  You can DISABLE 2FA on these features without the 2FA device and then withdraw or trade without any additional restrictions.

They did it based on the current rules of the game which you are now trying to change... I don't see anything wrong with that.  Besides, who do you think will continue to keep mining through the halvening?   It's those miners that basically can keep rigs running efficiently via low or subsidized electricity costs.
So about their internet... it's not really crappy internal to China.  It's just crappy from China to anywhere else and vice versa.  It seems you misunderstand their intentions.  If they use 20MB blocks internal to China and have most of the hash rate, it will be non-Chinese pools that get screwed with more orphans, not the other way around.

An artificially depressed EUR currency strength helps exports.  I'm sure Germany and other strong Euro member states benefit greatly from having the PIIGS in the Eurozone.  So, the countries that benefit from this trade surplus should have an obligation to help support the weaker countries.  Right now, there is just finger pointing that so and so is not doing their equal part, while in reality, for this system to succeed, equality cannot exist and a shared responsibility must prevail.  That is just not human nature.  When someone makes lots of money, they attribute it to their own skill and luck, and don't contribute back to the society structure that helped them get there to begin with.  When we see tags like  it's only because that's the exception rather than the rule.  I hope this realization happens soon, but for myself, I will hedge and try to maintain some decentralized individual control of my wealth so in the case it gets more ugly, I can survive.

happens to me all the time because ppl take time to send large amounts of coins...triple checking, rechecking, etc...10 mins almost always expires before accounting gives the OK on the amt and the address.  
you need to configure what coinbase or bitpay does with misspends.  payments to the payment address after the time expires.  for me....I moved all large payments back to wire transfers...because the unhedged misspends cost me more than the wire transfer fees... and the fx always went the wrong way for me on midspends that auto converted to USD.

Supply and demand will dictate that this will not happen.  Mining smaller blocks will net lower and lower amounts of fees and makes it non-economic to mine all the blocks this way for a long time.  You will also still have miners that want to build the biggest blocks allowable because it's profitable to do so.
We shouldn't limit the size of the min blocks...it's not that way now.  If I want to run a pool and only can handle XXMB blocks but the variable algo states XXXMB is the max, I should still be able to cap how many transactions I can handle and include.
I guess I would be more worried about over all latency and memory requirements as this starts to scale up with more transactions.  How will transactions scale the requirements over time? O(N^2 ) or something more linear?

WTF. EU put a bunch of countries on notice for not having bail-in rules? Let the banks fail and hold the management accountable for their actions. Criminal ( and economic. Do not pull some crap like using tax payer money OR confiscating savings. Moreover, these regulations exclude systemic creditors and shareholders. Namely, central banks, bluge bracket banks, and governments. So the private sector and individual creditors will get saddled with the fake recapitalization of the banks when they make bad choices and run out of money from either fines or inadequate reserve ratios. ARE YOU F******* KIDDING ME?!?!
How is the world so blind to what is going on right now that no one is doing anything to stop this. Aren't these all democratic countries? Apparently, the Cyprus model in 2013 of confiscating consumer deposits and screwing junior creditors ( was so successful, it's now the mandatory model in Europe. Countries that do not comply with these EU mandated rules get sent to the EU court of justice. Do we live in LALA LAND? Come on people, wake up.

I'm not advocating money laundering.  But, just transferring money to a EU bank outside of Greece is a good first step.  Putting in a different currency is even better.  And finally, getting out of the banking system altogether by getting into bitcoin is the end goal for total individual control of your deposits.   Most people don't have the technical know how to secure all of their funds themselves so intermediate solutions like diversifying to other banks/countries and centralized bitcoin services is probably the easiest step.

They will have capital controls imposed this week or next if they don't reach a deal with the EU.  Meaning, a Cypriot scenario is probably &gt; 60% based on economists forecasts where money in the country is seized by the government to pay off their debts and obligations.
If you have money in Greece now, doesn't matter if it's EUR or whatever, get it out.  Get it into Bitcoin.  Or you could lose 30% or more of it's value in relation to the rest of the world in the next 10 days.

Now that BTC is going up again, people are buying BTC and other cryptos and holding exposure there.

Hahaha, I've been having this discussion with our team on sidechains and I think you're spot on.  There aren't many ppl that understand both the technical and economic ramifications.
We're working on a very large secretive project that aims to address the economic side (on an altcoin).  Hopefully, some of the things we build / do can be replicated on other coins as we pioneer them.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:35:29
It was my suggestion that there needed to be a clear platform for companies that wanted to adopt and use Bitcoin and related services in their day to day activities.  There are quite a few businesses that have the wrong impression about Bitcoin and there needs to be a trusted organization that helps to give guidance.  Overall, I feel that this would be good for the community as a whole.  Unless of course, we want Bitcoin to remain a niche protocol that is never widely adopted.

The "problem" was the the Chinese central banking system and authorities are basically disallowing Bitcoin purchasing with Chinese Yuan.  In China, even if you are a multi-millionaire, you cannot freely move money outside of China.  You need to launder it or pay some shady broker to smuggle your wealth out of the country.  Unrestricted buying/selling of Bitcoins would serve this purpose extremely well; thus contributing to the high demand for Cryptos from China. 
Is the alternative of the Chinese not being able to purchase any Bitcoins on an exchange a better solution?  I think there's a lot of Chinese that would disagree.  I'm not saying that this is the ideal solution.  Of course no regulation at all would be great.  But it's pretty immature to ignore the existing environment and just swear about it and throw a tantrum.

Well, they allow leverage on the chinese trading sites so you can't say that no one has lost everything.  Also, there have been wallet thefts and hacks where people literally have lost everything.

Thanks for your answer!  Wish I could mark this as the "correct" solution.
I guess China is ok with Bitcoins as long as people are not using them to circumvent their CNY/USD managed ratio via a CNY -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD trade. 
Would it be weird for a Chinese exchange to disallow Crypto withdrawals?  Wouldn't this satisfy the purpose for the Chinese?  It still allows "investment" but requires liquidation to CNY for capital gains purposes.  I know this defeats the purpose of using BTC as a currency, but price discovery and investment is just as important too.  After all, people buy into Gold ETFs, not because they want to use it as currency or wear it as jewelry but because it serves as a component of their long term investment strategy.
The framework for taxes laid out on  is well suited for this too.

"Regulation" of bitcoin in my view is simply setting rules around its use that everyone can follow.  Whether it's surrounding tax issues, classification of it as a trading asset or AFS/Hold til Maturity type there needs to be clarity.  For example, Singapore distinguished between trading and investing activities and I think the US should do the same.
Aversion to regulation is obvious and I'm very much for the liberalization of capital, but to ignore the reason why specific standards are put in place in the first place without reason seems juvenile.
Monetary policy aside,
How do we combat money laundering?
How do we prevent theft but allow for safe and reliable storage/backups?
How should taxes be handled?
Is it a currency or a commodity or stock?
How should FX conversions be done and recorded?
These are simple questions that require guidance for any business thinking about using Bitcoins and require best practices that can facilitate faster adoption.

"Forex is almost completely unregulated"  I disagree with this statement.  There are strict regulations in place and punishments for not following them.
Here's one article on the benefits of forex regulation on the marketplace: 
That being said, I don't think you can directly compare forex regulation with Bitcoins because Bitcoin is not an exchange, but rather an asset.  You should compare regulation surrounding one specific currency or commodity vs Bitcoin if anything.

I think the point is, that if the top sites in China are starting to give in to the government restrictions, then the rest of the Chinese internet companies will follow suit.  There was a hope that the Chinese would find a way to overcome the regulatory environment which has been made clear that it's anti-cryptocurrency in China.  2 out of 3 major exchanges in China have sort of given up due to these imminent risks.  Huobi still operates at the risk that the CEO will go to jail and lose all of his money if they continue to operate as they currently do against the current rules.  Their CEO is hoping that China will change their regulatory views and decide not to regulate it.  (hahaha).  Of course he has a huge economic incentive to take this risk.  Overall, without Chinese buying demand and liquidity, Bitcoin is probably worth less to the rest of the international community as they have other methods of moving around and converting cash.  The actual price only matters to miners and the rate for which new Bitcoin is created.  It shouldn't affect Bitcoin commerce too much because merchants using vendors like Bitpay actually don't need to take any Bitcoin pricing risk since they get their proceeds in USD or whatever currency they request.

yes, gox was hacked back in 2011 and some users didn't change their passwords.  also, that new list started circulating last week or the week before and no one said anything about it even when I mentioned in the mtgox irc chat.
i had one user confirm he signed up after 2011 and his name/password (hash) was on that distribution list.  it seems that gox might have either gotten hacked again, the same back door exists, or there's an insider pushing out information, or the user that confirmed his name was on the list was lying.
sorry for all those who actually have money in gox, i feel for you.  i got my final rejection for verification 2 days ago after applying for validated status in early december.  i guess i got lucky!
please change your passwords regularly and keep your btcs in a cold-storage wallet if you're not actively trading them.  at this point, that's the only guaranteed method of security.

In the US, reporting of overseas account balances and other income that is not directly reported to the IRS is also based around self-reporting.  
Just because you CAN hide income/assets doesn't mean it's the right thing to do either.
Remember the blockchain is fully transparent so tracking the flow of funds from one wallet to another is actually easier with Cryptos than it is with cash or non SWIFT wires.

Hi guys, lets keep this an open forum.  I've recently accepted a position as the Director of Bitcoin strategies for a PR firm in NYC.  
I would like to openly discuss the best methods to drive Bitcoin adoption and awareness in mainstream business.  I'm familiar with traditional anti-money laundering, IT accounting transparency, and exchange regulations around the globe and am trying to figure out the most appropriate framework for Bitcoins to co-exist within that ecosystem.
It seems that views on Bitcoin regulation are bifurcated within the crypto community.  Half saying no regulation is the only way to go and the other half saying that increased regulation is the only way forward.
Let me hear your thoughts on the matter and I will keep the community involved with any developments or standards that we will try to promote to governments and businesses.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:53:24
1. Sidechains peg value to bitcoins so the usefulness is limited if you are using them to represent dynamic value.
2. You're better off using Open Assets on top of Bitcoin for issuing new coins or assets because it also leverages the security of the Bitcoin network and is pretty simple to do.
3.  Aliasing of addresses has been done and is implemented in various ways such as DNS entries.  The issue here is centralized lookups and trust.  I don't know of a fully functioning decentralized aliasing system yet.

I've had issues with Multibit in the past too so I don't use it as my primary.  Even with reset blockchain and transactions, I've just had better luck importing the wallet into a different client.

Increasing the top limit now seems like a good option...if we ever need to use it.  Get consensus in bitcoin core out there now at 20MB or dynamically higher as the top limit so that those blocks will be "accepted" by the rest of the network.  We can keep soft limits at 750kb - 1MB.  I think naturally, mining pools will switch over to mining larger allowed blocks, especially if there is a backlog, because it allows them to get more fees.  There's probably a balance there between increased number of fees received and the loss of revenue due to latency of transmitting bigger blocks and orphans.

nah. core wouldn't lose all it's influence.  the flag day is such a good compromise and something easy to do.  im referring to preventing a contentious HF and community fork. I'd much rather run core code with larger blocks than BU code without segwit.  this gives it a chance.
the social contract where miners control bitcoin has always been an issue for me which is why i support coins with less centralize pow models like vertcoin and monero.  the contention in my opinion is coming from those who feel they control the outcomes without listening to the miners.  do you really want to own coins on a stalled chain that is always under the influence of a larger hash rate?  core might have to fork just to reset the pow difficulty if this happens in an extreme way. most commenters don't understand this.

With the PIN alone, you can only view balances and receive coins on the ledgerwallet.  You cannot send out unless you have the decryption card or linked a 2FA device for helping to validate outgoing transactions.  The ledger wallet also erases itself after a few invalid pin entries so brute force is eliminated if the device is stolen.  AFAIK, the trezor can be brute forced if you forget your pin but I haven't tried it myself.

I guess I'm too jaded after looking at the bitlicense and MTL requirements.  Also, those for AML / KYC.  It seems that for certain businesses, you would need to require those users to also opt in to a full transparency scheme.

That's because.... global carry trade is unwinding now.  Borrow from Europeans at close to 0% interest rates and then invest elsewhere, such as Emerging Markets where the yield and carry is higher (in basically every asset class.)  Now that global ccy wars are on, you need to GTFO before everyone else so that's why you see panic selling.  It's not like you can unwind trillions of dollars worth of trades in one day when it took half a century to build those positions to begin with.

I consult with Chinese crypto clients all the time and this is completely not true.  We have difficulties all the time with network latency and bandwidth.  8MB is NOT a trivial increase.  (Yes, it seems like it should be moot given that my 4G phone get's 25Mbps and my FIOS internet gets 50Mbps in the US).  But, I urge people to please test themselves first!  I'm cool with XT and bigger block as long as we know it won't hurt the network adversely through unplanned forks which are MUCH worse than a forced XT fork.

@_date: 2015-08-16 19:01:01
SPV mining is good, as described by GMaxwell 
However, there are also drawbacks.  It's a good "hack" but it also creates more centralization.  I wish P2pool worked better and block validation hashing was implemented for P2pool miners.  I think there would be lots less issues.
Again, I'm not against these changes.  I just want to test them in a more systematic manner and deploy them with some regularity in process...like the BIPs.

@_date: 2015-08-13 15:40:46
All of DCG companies AFAIK are going to participate.  Although, with their primary company being Coinbase, the regulation puts up high barriers to competition from new startups without major funding.  So, companies that are in favor of the legislation are companies with funding or something to lose from new startups in the space.  This also includes banks and established money transmitters.

Banks trusting each other works in a liquid credit environment.  If you were in banking back in 2008 and saw the run on Lehman first hand and realized that no one really trusted anyone, you would want either a fully decentralized ledger that no cartel or single entity controls, or you would want something completely centralized (which is a big security risk if your keys are compromised and leaked.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:03:19
I don't think you understand how bad these orphan chains are for the network.  Forget using 0 conf at all.  It's like when we had the bug and SPV miners were creating really long orphan chains a month or so back and we had to wait 30+ confs to be sure our transactions were included in the right chain.  That's terrible for Bitcoin.

Yeah, you read twobitidiot's mailer?  The 21MM coin limit is hard and anything else would require everyone to agree as a hardfork to accept those new blocks over 21MM.   At some point in the future, if fees are not high enough to sustain the transition from PoW mining blocks to PoW mining fee only, then something will have to give.

It's a straight up pump from a sales group.   
You get 10% commissions for referring ppl to buy litecoins down to 9 levels.  But, you are required to deposit your coins into their member center as are they.  You can take out 65% of them, I assume the rest is used to pay interest bonuses and stuff.  So coins in the system are used to pay interest rewards, but continued marketing ensures that it keeps getting bigger and bigger, until someone pulls the plug and runs away and dumps the entire member center account into the market.  Going to be an epic pump and dump coming up.  Although, I think some of these teams are really good at marketing and the Chinese population is really gullible...apparently.  
As scammy as this sounds...it's sort of like US Social Security.  A Pay-as-you-go pension plan where the interest and benefits to the current members are paid for by the new members and no one wins in the end.  Lol.

This crap deal, will push Greece and by extension the EU closer to rioting.  That is the greatest risk to the central banking system at this point.  Not that the central bankers get to decide on haircuts, but that people unite and just say FU to the bankers and no longer pay back to them.
Most bankers and governments see this risk and are quietly moving to restrict free market p2p assets transfer mechanisms such as physical cash.  By keeping everyone into a fully centralized and controlled digital economy, they are able to institute capital controls and do bail-ins at will ala Greece.
I read some article somewhere that said, the threshold for rioting and overthrowing the government has historically been around 40% unemployment.  I think we are much closer to that number in Greece at this point than the stats actually say.
Actually, the YOUTH unemployment rate is over that rate already.

I'm not sure, the "stop using mycelium" is the right move.  It's an evolving project and there's bound to be some growth curves.  The benefits of having their centralized nodes over SPV are that they help fast network propagation of your transactions if configured properly.  I keep a little here and there and even a few on Coinbase to use so I don't get stuck.  I'll probably just recover my seed into a new trezor I bought and use that as an alternative to Mycelium when their servers aren't working.

I read an article a while back that I can't find now.  It basically made an argument that revolt via rioting comes down to a simple opportunity cost dynamic.  This is driven by an unemployment / poverty indicator.
If you can't make enough money via welfare or available work / trade to feed your family under the current regime, then revolt.  If you cannot sustain yourself, then don't revolt.
I think the indicator that I read about was a 40% unemployment threshold that put a population into the "revolt" category.   Or maybe it was, if 40% of the population is in the "revolt" category, the government falls.  In any case, this looks to be the end game for monetary policy and central banking unless huge debt writedowns are taken across the board.
I also seem to recall a circulated note from a bank to high net worth clients back in 2007 or so while I was working in banking.  It stated something along the lines of, the biggest risk to high net worth client portfolios is revolt by the common people or 99% for those that were following the Occupy Wall St movement.

this is spot on.  we spent tens of thousands of dollars to our attorneys for them to tell us that everything we want to do using Bitcoin, and everything that is currently out there can be considered illegal.  They said to throw lots of money out there at the problem so when it comes time for our criminal sentencing, the judge could be more lenient.

@_date: 2015-08-16 18:32:20
Agreed with this.  In fact, most miners will probably keep the defaults low anyway, just like how they keep the defaults now which are less than the max of 1MB.  But, when a big block is mined, it could clog the network and cause all kinds of bad behavior.  Can someone just show me a test of this working properly at 8MB?

I highly doubt any real country would officially adopt bitcoin as a sovereign currency, however bitcoin being used as the peoples money is really unstoppable if adoption picks up.  As I was quoted before, "bitcoin is borderless" and that's what I feel its killer app is.  The whole world is globalizing and political boundaries no longer reflect friendship boundaries or economic boundaries.  The whole country thing is overrated and having one global currency allows us to finally live together without old dudes or ladies in power telling us what we can or cannot do.

Bitpay will require onebit to go through verification and prove their business model and processes before adding a high limit for conversions.  This check is what's important and is what limits their liability as long as it's done properly.  IMHO, if onebit does lots of conversions, Bitpay will force a fee on them for "support" in order for them to increase their daily FX limits.

There are others that just are straight copies because someone wanted to own and market their own coin because it's cool or silly or they think they'll get rich.
