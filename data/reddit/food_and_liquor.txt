You cant be a criminal if theres no crime being perpretrared. Possessing and Controlling Controlled substances is a victimless crime.  


"If a law is unjust, a man not only has a duty to disobey it, he is obligated to do so" - Thomas Jefferson


A false equivocation, hasty generalization, attribution bias, illusion of truth/asymetrical insight. The cognitive dissonance you display is no more than pernicious reification. 


You fucking hypocrite! Dont you realize that if cannabis were made legal at the fed level, the entire controlled sunstances act would become null &amp; void? See Gonzales V. Raich. 
Fucking clueless.

Its not. Dreadd was hoodwinked. What happened was the "victim", Curtis Green, was flipped by fedders. The fuckboy who went to jail in this case, Mark Force IV, was posing as a cartel leader and had baited said shitbird into accepting a ki of coke (which the deetz on that are still sketch.) 
(If anyone is familiar with Sabu, he's the one who flipped on Jeremy Hammond for hacking stratfor. He's also the one who helped the fuckboys crack dreadds government.)  
Dreadd had ordered the hit on Curtis after Force, posing as a hitman, had set up a fake torture sting (which has been done before, see Hells Angels.) Dreadd had asked Force to do this, AFTER FORCE HAD TOLD HIM HE WAS AN ENFORCER. Force provided opportunity through his BS back story and the rest was history. 
To me, it would seem like Force did entrap Dreadd. To the courts &amp; law, no. Dreadd was egotistical &amp; certainly had motive, but Force couldnt prove shit, since his own involvement in stealing the BTC's makes him an accessory after the fact. He too should be faced with RICO charges and a new trial set for Dreadd so that the people can see just how fucked the fuckboys really are. 
Also, Dreadds trial was completely fucked and biased: the judge should have reecused themselves.

Did you not read what was said by the govt? If an exception is made to the rule, then the rule becomes "unenforceable."
You're a dumbass.
