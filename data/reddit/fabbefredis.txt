Call me crazy spewing out my opinion of BTC on but you absolutely don't need to own BTC. I'm a doubter on it, reason being there are coins out there that are objectively better than BTC out there, given you've excluded public knowlege from the equation. 
EDIT: To rephrase what I mean by objectively better: cryptocurrencies solve real world problems. The problems that bitcoin solves are many: decentralising currency, the code behind it makes for a very solid system, it's a currency that breaks certain barriers which "real" currencies can't, etc. 
However, these problems are solved in the fundamentals of not only Bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies as a whole. They build on top of bitcoin, not beside it like real world currencies. The fundamental difference between the USD and the AUD aren't very great, but when you compare Bitcoin to other currencies which can solve very real and serious problems we face in the real world, it just doesn't bring anything new. It was needed in the beginning to fuel the world of cryptocurrencies forward, but at this point, I doubt its necessity to the cryptocurrency world.
Ultimately, what I'm proposing is that Bitcoin doesn't solve problems that other cryptos do. I wouldn't expect anybody to agree, but do understand.

It's understandable that they do that. Transaction fees on BTC are god damn bonkers. It could cost you up to $20 to move *any* amount of BTC: it doesn't matter if it's $1 or $200k; it's $20 ^^+$10 ^^for ^^transactions ^^larger ^^than ^^$1500 ^^or ^^so, ^^but ^^whatever

Honestly, I'd say you should invest in some smaller crypto-currency and use your accumulated wisdom to hold the coin until it grows, big time. There are plenty of better options than Bitcoin if you're thinking of larger gains on your investment and thinking you *have* to hold BTC to be a crypto-investor is complete bonkers.

Any chance above 0 is possible. As far as I can tell, that chance is above 0, thus possible, and also not impossible.

Maybe the dude who found 950 BTC written on that HDD a few weeks back really found 950 BTC and is claiming his house in Beverly Hills?

Eh. There seem to be plenty of houses in BH under $3M, which he could afford since he'd get ~4.1M ^^ohwaitnevermindiforgotabouttaxes
Small house? Maybe?
