What's the relation between speculating and the value of bitcoin dropping to 0?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:39:40
that bitcoin will end up worth 0 is not a logical conclusion from the fact that people are making wild estimations

Is there a clear cause for the downturn?

What if I can't afford a house with my savings?

But what if my alternative is paying rent. Why not take a mortgage out so i can buy a house with a small savings and then instead of paying rent evrry month to other people i pay the same amount every month to pay off my house.

Doesn't bitcoin increase in value the more people buy it, not the more people spend it as a currency?
