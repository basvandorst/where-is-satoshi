Forfeiting piracy is okay because there are many concerns already? You're wrong about that.
Nice manipulation tactic though, with the whole bully angle.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:03:52
Just like counterfeit bank notes?

When the majority of altcoins follow bitcoin's trend, yes it's a little dumb to invest in altcoins with the intention of diversifying.  The purpose of a diverse portfolio is to mitigate risk.
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:05:17
Reducing risk should be a simple concept to grasp, but you're not quite there yet.

It says bitcoin and ATM on it, Sherlock.

Imaginary me wouldn't have sold. Way too smart for that.

Scan the qr code with your phone?
@_date: 2019-07-04 08:26:34
I think it'd be checked just like a high denomination bank note.  I'm no rocket scientist or anythin like you though, Mister.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:13:34
No I didn't.

I'm waiting

Facebook has the reach to rapidly push this to all of their users, which poses an 
imminent threat to the usd.  It could be seen as an outright attack, which would explain the multiple kicks to the throat within the letter.  I don't think it's anymore complicated than that.
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:54:50
Someone else
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:44:33
Me neither
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:46:09
Well, that makes no sense. On your way.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:06:12
You tell me?

Nerds made moon.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:00:22
No, your argument doesn't.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:28:18
Like outside of crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:09:34
I'm in. Wheres this mining company?

This Russian app has no privacy policy, requests a passport framed photo and uploads it to servers for their AI to look at. 
Sounds like fun.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:29:20

Let's agree to disagree with you

They were purchased by investors at a rate which was available to everyone many weeks after launch... 
That's an insanely fair IPO.

If I went back in time and told my 16 year old self that,  he'd say "whatever" and buy a car.

Yeh. Riches not mean smarters.

I dunno, because the entire story is a tweet about Mark Karpeles being found guilty?

In all sincerity, how does one not know the very most basic concept of taxation? I mean, to not even figure this out by accident is incredible and quite the anomaly. I'm legitimately interested in how this is possible.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:18:38
Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:03:32
I'll take "things millionaires never say" for one bitcoin, Alex.

It's not the end of the week yet.  Give him a chance.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:16:47
Sure did and here's some extra info:
Didn't like my funds being held hostage, so I googled a usa address (not my country) and used it to pass basic usa requirements.  Then I could transfer everything into a fresh coinbase account created using my real address and country.  
Coinbase eventually got back to me with something, but gdax support responded and changed the country first and days before coinbase replied. If your account is connected to gdax, give them a go first. 
Don't bother with their automated systems, you'll just waste your time going around in circles (I tried it all).
Hope that helps somewhat? Good luck!

The first parkour gym to accept Bitcoin.  Write this in your diary, people.

I should base my strategy on future events by using a "future only" time machine. Got it.

That's great. Keep up the good work.

CoinJar has some incredibly high fees. Fees for everything. They hide the fees too. They're sneaky fuckers.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:37:14
You'd have bigger gains if you didn't blindly ignore the market in times like this.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:25:20
It's a comment thread. I'm not speaking directly to you, so no need to be defensive. Have a good one.
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:39:33
I now hate bitcoin. Thanks.

You're not supposed to eat the shell?
Well, that explains a lot...

I'm going to run my business on positive sentiment. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:10:53
How can you not be concerned with the price of a currency if you own said currency? Not caring is head-in-the-clouds poor financial decision making.
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:55:53
In my opinion, they wouldn't solely target ICO's for regulation when someone can premine and list anything for a price.  Wouldn't stop Chinese ICO's setting up offshore either.

Eventually, the bots will battle.  Plays will be counterplayed and those will be played and on and on...  One day the plays and counterplays will reach a stalemate and bitcoin will flatline, never wavering.  It's a bot controlled lottery and everyone's playing to win.  Holders cross their fingers while hoping the bot's numbers align and they hit the jackpot. The end.

They're using NASDAQ’s SMARTS Market Surveillance Technology.
What a puff piece.

Thousands of bots creating an exponentially expanding TA hive mind doesn't seem far fetched. It's likely that this is already happening.
