Agreed, using a groupon app is a little different than handing your wallet to someone. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:21:15
I expected something really different with that title...
Good info, OP. Thanks for the PSA
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:31:51
It is if you are being purposefully ambiguous.
@_date: 2012-12-11 14:55:45
Okay once I get revisions made I will be sure to do that. (I'll put a downloadable link on the last page most likely)
@_date: 2012-12-11 01:13:21
Thanks! I'm working on fixing some issues right now that others have brought up, i'll revise when they are complete.
@_date: 2012-01-18 02:20:47
A lot of people pointed down while looking at me... Sigh.

Whenever it turns up high enough to get a good return on the investment. Play the market just like the stock exchange or any currency exchange. I initially sold back when it was about 18 a coin, bought up at 2.5, sold at 4 re-bought at 4 once it started its most recent  rise (a loss with exchange fees, but easily made up even if I would had sold again at 6 it so) and here we are at 7 with it still rising.

Did you notice anywhere else that I restated this information, for the abstract ideas I mainly worked from Satoshi's original proposal and I know that things were implemented differently
@_date: 2012-12-11 14:48:48
S8P3* - Yeah this slide is describing miners contribution to the network, when I say "node" here I mean a node that actively mines. I'll change wording to make that more clear.


S14 - Makes sense, I'll revise to this as well. Sha-0 pre imaging attacks were found to be possible, Sha-1 pre-imaging attacks theretical. What does the 2^51 mean? The paper indicates that it would take 2^51 SHA-1 function calls to find the message by brute force. Is this accurate?




@_date: 2012-12-11 14:59:11


This is whats stated in the thesis the table was taken from so sounds like that's what it means, if anyone knows otherwise I hope they come forward to help clarify.
@_date: 2012-12-11 01:11:36
The target audience was my telecommunications grad course for ECE, myself and a colleague did a collaboration on it, so the technical aspects where kind of the point, the overview abstract stuff was just to introduce the professor and other students to what bitcoin is before I pummeled them with a bunch of technical information.
@_date: 2012-12-15 15:40:12
God. Dammit. I really really fucking hate that bar on the side. Its a pain in the ass to browse to anything.
@_date: 2012-11-26 23:37:40
Okay, be patient with me I really want to get this right for the sake of expanding actual knowledge.


Changed the first bit to this, sound more accurate?


Changed that to describe how the network expands, as honestly all of that is just for miners since non miners just download the block chain right?


Taken from here 
I read that on some bitcoin blog, one of the ones I forgot to site. How is that going to be processed moving into the 21M limit? if you had to take a guess, or is there any citing anywhere?
@_date: 2012-12-11 01:38:21


Do miners in pools no longer work on solving nonces? I was under the impression that the difference was the pool server was dishing out blocks of nonces to check such that the contributing nodes still solve for the proof of work. 


True that hard drive manufacturers are switching gears towards faster drives in the SSD sphere, but I'm convinced that as the technology becomes cheaper they will be pushing for not only faster, but also larger SSDs, either way storage considerations shouldn't be an issue for some time and even if the rate of creating dramatically increases I'm sure just about every node has more than 4GB per year free. (Less even as older blocks with duplicate coin transactions are forgotten as they become obsolete)


I worded this poorly. Nodes are able to obtain the merkle root and verify that it is valid. They cannot obtain the branch for a particular transaction, thanks for catching this. 


The next three are slides that my colleague worked on (I'm Bernens, he is Hall). I'll do my best to correct them. I do believe he had his working backwards. The errors in sha-1 were duplicate answers, meaning multiple inputs could result in the same output. I don't recall hearing about Sha-1 being backwards decryptable. I think he was talking about brute forcing the result by using the exploit of single result for multiple input. Going to look into this and fix accordingly. 


Again, Halls slide, I'm assuming something along these lines:
"A known nonce makes the encrypted message easy to check against the known hash."


"As Bitcoin grows and more power is put into the network, more computational power is needed to hash blocks, as the difficulty increases."

That's, slightly terrifying.

That's awesome, thanks for sharing. I tried finding a bunch of stuff like this when I was putting it together but haven't seen this one before!

Do we get our referrals in advance or do we have to pay in advance?

Be aware of this. I wasn't and he tried making me pay more than the 1.65 I saw when I asked to buy. 
@_date: 2012-12-15 17:03:48
That's exactly what it was doing to me. I had to mouse over it from the side for it to work proper.

I don't know what any of what you said is. I play politics based on whats the best choice for the average person. Not the fucking high brow shits wanting tax cuts or the lazy fucks wanting free money for getting knocked up 10 times and sitting on their asses.

It should be open for downloads, let me double check.
EDIT: I take this back. I made it unable to be downloaded as I didn't want it getting edited and re-uploaded having someone else take credit. Since this was for a class, having a duplicate of it plagiarized from me could cause issues like the professor thinking I was the one who plagiarized.
EDIT2: If you know of a way I can make it downloadable but not editable I'll do that. I could always publish it as a slideshow or .pdf, if you would want that let me know.
@_date: 2012-12-11 01:47:37
Thanks for that, can't catch everything :)

Part of the assignment was to use an ethical philosophy to back our paper, so that part was inevitable. I had heard about the whole thing with china as I was halfway through writing it and to incorporate it into the essay would've taken time I didn't have, otherwise I would completely agree that the thing with china is a huge deal for the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2011-12-16 19:13:07
This is one of the things that came up in our class quite often. There are a ton of levels in a question like this. For starters, can you ethically work on a project that can potentially take millions of lives? If you say no, the argument arises that while killing millions, it my perhaps save billions. Look at the death rate at Hiroshima and Nagasaki vs the projected death rate if the US were to invade Japan. Now is it justified. Or look at it from a standpoint of your national pride. Can you work on these projects for the benefit of your country and call it ethical? Its a complex question, and to me personally, I think that any type of war machine or weapon built, especially in today's world, can be justified, ethically, as it is protecting more people then it can potentially harm. 
@_date: 2011-09-09 23:43:31
Its all so clear now...
@_date: 2011-12-16 01:37:30
The thing about an ethical grey area is that while there isn't a particular law that states a decentralized currency is illegal, there are certain implications to promoting it such as its use for illicit activities which law makers will say is a reason to shut it down. The paper is meant to discuss if the ethical implications are greater than the supposed law against it. 
Are you a professionally licensed engineer? Or are you a member of IEEE? If so you may want to take a look at the NSPE Code of ethics or the IEEE Code of Ethics.  If not, this doesn't apply to you.

I have a good deal of respect for a company that can own up to its mistakes. Well done MtGox.
@_date: 2011-12-16 19:07:50
Ah yea as I'm reading that first sentence I realize that ambiguity in the way I worded it. That one is on me. I meant that as a US citizen we are expected to follow the government laws, but if the ethical thing to do goes against the laws we still have the duty to preform the ethical task and not the lawful task.
You are right, law makers are bullies, which is why, IMO the right thing to do is to use bitcoin, as the argument against it is weak and applies to other, centralized currencies. 
I think the professional engineer licensing is a good thing to be honest. Much like doctors have to be licensed or lawyers have to be licensed, engineers have the same responsibilities to society, even without being licensed or joining an organization. Clearly engineers hold knowledge that can benefit or inhibit mankind, and it is our necessary choice to not hinder progress but to help it flourish.

The problem is that my balance is already 0.00 btc in my wallet so if I try to resend with the proper amount it says I don't have sufficient funds.
From what I understand Pywallet can delete transactions, but I have no idea how to get in installed so its a dead end

Why has the term "credits" not been coined for uBTC yet?

Wow... that went... way over my head... ~~So I need to switch to like... elegeius? Is that a wallet? Searching for it gives me some stuff that is not in english and doesn't seem to be BTC related...~~ 
So Elegeius is a mining pool? How does that help?

Yeah, I had read somewhere (in my hour or so of googling) that nodes will remove transactions from their queue if they go unverified for a long enough amount of time... I'd post some info on the transaction but it looks like it never even hit the network.. idk its just showing up in my log as zero verification.

Got the rescan going now... will report back..
For those wondering I opened the "C:/Program Files/Bitcoin" folder at the command line (shift + right click it) and was able to type bitcoin-qt.exe -rescan
