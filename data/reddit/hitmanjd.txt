That is a good answer. And I suppose the user base dwindled in the face of competing technology such as bit torrent and Spotify and YouTube. 
Hopefully bitcoin is future proof in that regard.

But I'm pretty sure they shutdown the gnutella network

It's significant because they seized it. One of the major reasons people use Bitcoin is to avoid that kinda thing happening to them

Wasn't it shutdown by authorities though? Because if so then couldn't the same thing happen to Bitcoin? If not why not.

But gnutella had 3 million nodes at one point. Doesn't Bitcoin have around 10k. I could be misunderstanding something here

I do understand what Bitcoin is. The basics of how it works. I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means. One element I don't know a lot about is the BIP.
it struck me earlier today when I was asked why Bitcoin and not an alt coin. I replied with Bitcoin has a number of advantages, its hash rate making it the most secure, the brand name and should another coin adopt a protocol that's better than something bitcoin is doing then bitcoin can change itself to include it via the BIP. I was then asked to explain BIP and realized ive a lot of gaps in my knowledge.

Can you suggest some reading material.

I'll be detrimental to adoption. Harder to sell people an asset that's easily lost. I'm hoping development continues in this space that makes the keys easier to keep hold of. That'll encourage adoption which will have a greater impact on price.

If it doesn't break ATH within 3 years.
