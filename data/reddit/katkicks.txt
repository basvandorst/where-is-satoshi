[Update] Thanks for your help and support, guys! My women's college got added to coinbase's approved .edu list

Nice design, good layout/feedback on where you are on the site/etc.  
I might make the bottom footer a little lighter... right now it could be considered "inactive" because the text is too grey in contrast to the orange around it.  Maybe hover states on the currencies that make them brighten up a bit.  
Viewing from a 17in screen and everything seems a bit small, but if you don't have the resources for fluid/responsive, its understandable.  
Love the logo

I go to the number  ranked college in the USA and it is not on the list either!  Did you get an e-mail response back from them?  I'm waiting on one

I'd like to see YOUR eyes of passion, my friend.  Get yourself a margarita to get warmed up. @_date: 2015-08-05 22:14:32
Why does it matter if she's a girl?  **Not cool.**  The winky face doesn't make it ok.  Come on, you're better than that.

I missed that, thank you for correcting.  
It's so easy to jump to the defense sometimes especially with some of the things I've seen posted on this sub regarding women in the Bitcoin sphere.  Not an excuse, but some insight as to why I was on the defense.

How about promoting a btchusbands group too?  Or just btcspouses/so?  
Statements like that can make women feel like imposters in this community.

Awesome! I will!

When pictures and events like this aren't a rarity, then we can stop discussing.
