The phrase 'a broken clock is right twice a day' is appropriate here. You can't look at whether some people predicted the housing bubble as by itself that's meaningless. You need to look at all of their predictions. 
There's an entire category of scam that stockbrokers/investment advisors have run that works like this, where you take a group of people, convince half to buy some highly volatile asset and half to sell it short. Since it's a volatile asset, one of those groups is going to make a lot of money. The other group will hate you. 
Now go back to the group that you made such a great 'prediction' for, and do the same thing again. You'll probably lose another half, but do it a third time and now you have 1/8th of the original people that you look like an absolute genius to, having gotten three   risky (and thus potentially high-return) investment predictions right in a row for.

The fees are lower because the company is subsidizing the users more substantially. Why do you think they've raised $26 million? It gives them a large amount of runway.
Revenue can come later, and grabbing for it too early is often not a winning strategy in large-scale consumer plays. Their goal is to build trust with users and get a wide array of users to start thinking of Circle as their digital currency bank.

ZipZap allows for cash-in to bitcoin, not cash-out.
Remittance is a very tough nut to crack and ZipZap's current model won't solve the problem, part of which is that retail locations don't typically have the kind of cash on hand to make remittance payouts of any size or frequency to the remittance recipient.

It just means which round of investment they're in. Typically you have:
Seed round (possibly multiple)
Series A
Series B
There's no hard distinction between a seed round and a series A, but if a particular investment round was a series A, the next round will be a series B, then a series C, etc. That's all it means. Changetip has already raised a seed round, so Pantera called this a series A.

It's not really comparing the same thing because Western Union can transfer actual usable currency, whereas people need to convert that bitcoin back to their local currency to use it in Bitcoin's case. 
In other words, to end up with the same thing on the recipient's end (the dominant local currency), the above is missing a step and makes bitcoin look at lot less convenient for money transfer purposes for most people.

It'd be fairly easy for Paypal to do this. Paypal has a central, internal ledger it uses. Bitcoin has a central, internal ledger it uses. You have to open a Changetip account to receive or send tips with Changetip. You'd have to do the same with Paypal.
Changetip's advantage is that it's small and scrappy and it's worth them working on getting tipping working, whereas there's no real incentive for Paypal to even think about it until someone else shows there's demand for widespread tipping on the net. They simply operate at a completely different scale.

Not even close to the most popular based on attendance numbers at least. Things like Coachella, EDC, Ultra, etc attract substantially higher numbers of people.
You're also, I should point out, donating to the Burning Man Project, under whose banner Burning Man the festival falls as well as other Burner projects they've working on (though I'm pretty unclear on specifics there). The organizers are attempting to spread Burner culture worldwide. Whether that's worth donating for or not is a different question.
Also, the expenses are pretty substantial, such as several million for the land it's on paid to the federal government, etc. Whether they actually turn a profit or not I don't know, and it's actually a fairly complicated question, as there isn't just one organization involved. There's an LLC, for instance, that is owned by the original founders I believe, that owns the trademarks to the event, and licenses them to the Burning Man Project.

This is a fantastic opportunity for the Bitcoin community to rescue itself. When Wall Street blew itself up in the late 00s, government had to come in to rescue it. Today, when Gox goes down, the Bitcoin community can ride to the rescue. Who doesn't love that? If Brock's group pulls this off, nobody loses and all the interested parties win.
Maybe victims won't be any better off here than in any other bankruptcy outcome, but I've known Brock for nearly 15 years, and he's a phenom. He's one of the single best people I've ever met at putting together the resources, quickly, needed to get a deal done.
He's also a magnet for talented people, and probably the most prolific investor in the Bitcoin space to date. It's not an exaggeration to say that if it can be done, he's one of the most likely people to get it done. He's like a fucking honey badger - not kidding.
Best outcome here is that Brock and his group are successful in their bid to acquire Gox, and manage to turn it around, pay back the victims 100%, and operate a well-managed exchange to the benefit of everyone in the space.
Worst case scenario is that they take it over and mis-manage it so horribly that people lose the 20% of btc Gox has, but I think that risk is substantially mitigated by his group's record and experience.

No, they don't limit attendance arbitrarily. Their size is limited by the permit they have from the federal Bureau of Land Management. The primary reason for that limitation is that highway 447 (the road 99% of Burners use to get there) is a shitty two-lane highway that gets completely clogged around Burning Man. We're reaching the peak limit of that highway's capacity (and ain't nobody building a new highway so a bunch more of us can go on vacation to the desert for a week every year).

So many of you seem to lack an understanding of what ownership is. Ownership is, in all meaningful ways, about control. Anything else is just handwaving. 
If you ever want to own anything tied to a physical asset, it comes down to having men with guns backing you up. Bitcoin is interesting and new because it DOESN'T depend on men with guns, but Bitcoin is also purely virtual and can -never- grant or secure control of physical assets. That is done, ultimately, entirely by men with guns, unless you can achieve literally a 100% consensus. With 7+ billion people, good luck.
The reason that fiat's value is backed by men with guns is that ultimately, the government can insist that you pay them property taxes and any other kind of tax that's tied to physical assets in fiat currency, or their men with guns will seize your assets, and there isn't a thing Bitcoin  or any cryptocurrency can do about it.
You might not like it, but it's like arguing that you don't like that physical assets are vulnerable to physical seizure or that you don't like that the moon isn't made of green cheese.

The problem is that ownership is a meaningless concept the way you frame it. What defines a piece of physical property as 'yours'? There is nothing about the property itself that is 'yours'. It's not a property of the property, if you see what I mean.
You're simply laying claim to it, as anyone else can. You say it's yours. Fine, I say it's mine. Now we're at an impasse because we both believe it's our own. Whether you think you have the 'right' to use 'defensive force' against someone is meaningless, as I can equally believe I have the right to do so, and there's nobody to prove either of us wrong or right....except whoever has more men with guns backing them up.
Take Liberland, for instance. I've already personally claimed all land on earth, therefore their claim to ownership is morally invalid from my perspective (I haven't as I'm not insane, but for the sake of argument assume I have). Does my perspective matter? Not unless I have men with guns willing to back it up.
The dollar is valuable because physical property ownership depends on someone backing up that claim in a way that someone else can't trump, and governments sit at the top of that food chain, since they have the most men with guns. You can call it bribing or you can call it paying someone to back up your arbitrary claim to ownership. Either way, it boils down to the same thing: The dollar has value because men with guns say it does.

Bitcoin could cut into the interest they earn on personal deposits, but more likely they and companies like Coinbase will end up taking btc deposits, lending out money in a fractional reserve system, and pay interest on them....exactly like fiat denominated accounts.

Never selling because "The price could go higher" is a recipe for losing money almost every time on an investment, since it's always true and so leads to just holding onto an asset forever.

What they should have been doing was selling bitcoin into the massive  and blatantly unsustainable runup of 2013. They'd be far better off today had they been diversifying/selling according to a plan on the way up rather than just naively holding essentially all of their assets in a single investment.

I don't think you understand what JP Morgan does if you think Bitcoin is going to make them obsolete. Bitcoin is not going to business's and peoples' need for loans. It's not going to replace advising on mergers and acquisitions, or underwriting, and it's not going to replace asset management and treasury services.

That's right, it's not. You can substitute in gay people, non-Christians, immigrants, etc for black people. The story is the same. States rights is code for "I want to discriminate and don't want the feds telling me I can't."

I guess you didn't see how badly the recent board election went when it used the blockchain? They had to nullify the election and use a smoother method in a second election it was so bad.

They should have diversified in order to reduce their exposure to a single asset.

Can't believe they kept most of their assets in Bitcoin. So dumb.

They will, but then what's Bitcoin's advantage? Offering the same services like fraud protection or money back cost real money and someone is going to pay for that - likely the merchant. 
At that point, how is what you're describing any different than today's system? It's now the same system with a different name.

I sent multiple people paypal payments this morning, and they reported receiving them an hour later.
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:19:22
Sure, I have customers who do sometimes. It's the price of doing business, and anti-fraud protocols can't stop all fraud.
I know I'm far better equipped to take the risk than customers are, however. This is my full-time business, after all.
At the end of the day, I need customers to buy from me a LOT more than they need to buy from me, and so it behooves me as the merchant to do whatever I can to lower the friction involved in them completing a transaction with me.

* Immediate funds access: Not particularly useful to me as our margins are high enough that cash flow isn't really an issue, but certainly useful to many businesses.
* Paying my people is already simple if all I want to do is give them money, but payroll as a larger problem is not one Bitcoin does much for. Taxes, disability, benefits, employer-incentivized savings plans, health insurance, etc.
* Of course I'd like to imagine my profits and savings going up, but that's so speculative as to be fairly worthless as a point here. I can sink today's USD earnings into speculative investments and hope they go up too, just the same.
"It wouldn't require anything more than upgrades to your computer software." - I'm guessing you've never had to run payroll. ;)

I got two emails from Stripe about it, so I think they're reaching out to merchants pretty well.

This makes absolutely no sense.
You can't keep money under your mattress so you need a loan from a bank? The latter does not follow in any way from the former.

Based on conversations in the foundation forums, it looks like they're going to nullify this vote and go back to another election in Helios. 
I've been a long-time supporter of the Foundation, but it's getting pretty hard to maintain that stance. What a clusterfuck.

Yep, this is a problem with all digital/blockchain voting. Unless there's a way to, with a very high level of confidence, tie someone's rl identity to their digital identity, voting on the blockchain has very little value as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:28:48
Public voting records lend themselves to selling votes because there's public verification that you voted for who someone paid you to vote for. With secret ballots, buying someone's votes outright is a dubious proposition as there's no way at all to confirm.

I've been a credit-card accepting merchant for almost 20 years. I don't at all feel screwed by credit card fees. Visa/Mastercard and Paypal make it easy for customers to pay me while having the piece of mind that they will lose 0 if I rip them off or if someone steals their card and uses it.
And best of all, settlement happens in the currency I have to use to pay people who work for me, the government, vendors, and so on.
Bitcoin is great, but as a replacement for credit cards it sucks.
