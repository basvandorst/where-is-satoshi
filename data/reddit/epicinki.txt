Oh damn, congrats bud! 
I should get back to Changetip and Bitcoin but since I had a hard drive failed I lost my old wallet which I was using at the time (lucky I didn't have much in it) and then I forgot about Bitcoin until this came up on my wall :3
I probably have like some bits left on my account though :3

How do you extract the Bitcoins from the address anyways? For future reference? :3

I would be happy, if I had Bitcoin to celebrate about xD! 
I had so much in the past, spend a lot of it and lost some of it due to a hard drive wipe.

Man, I'm on the game but have no clue how to get the keypad activated... :/
I've spent about a hour looking at all the clues that work and wandering around the room picking up the jacket etc... I eventually got a game over, I guess I clicked something by accident.
This would be good if loads of people were helping, I mean the cash prize is 5btc :3

Uhm, I thought I saw somewhere it said that. It could of been an old puzzle though, but basing it upon several other puzzles by the creator, they are around 5Btc.
