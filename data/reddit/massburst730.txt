I think name recognition has a lot to do with it. Crypto is very crowded.

THe article literally starts by describing him as the former head of EDL. Fuck those people. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:28:23
I was referring to the former leader of the English Defense League that this article was about.

Wow, How do you not get this? I'm not some 14 gamer who you're gonna connect with and help misinform. I have a poli sci degree and have worked in politics and public policy. You are misinformed and somewhat conspiratorial. Please learn history and don't fill in the gaps with right wing propaganda. 


I would not make that mistake because i understand both the histories and context of the words I use. No one describes themselves as a leftist because that word is primarily use by far right extremests to describe anything and everything that calls them out on their lies. I like bitcoin and decentralization in general. Blockchain technology does not belong to nationalists or liberatrians or anybody in particular. The underlying tech is more akin to the early days of dual entry book keeping from my perspective. Also Paypal is not a state it is a privately held company trying to seperate itself from wierdo's like the EDL. If you are wondering why crypto isn't being adopted widely maybe stop posting articles about the freaks at the EDL and stop turning everybody off Bitcoin. Fringe politics are primarily a distraction used to distract the public along antiquated political cleavages that allow entrenched powers to limit oversight. You sound like one of those creeps that thinks Bannon  is onto something. Pro decentralization does not equal pro culture war nationalist bullshit. Seriously tell the EDL piece of shit to use Venmo. Fuck the alt-right.

You're wrong,those ideologies exist on opposite ends of the political spectrumYou sound very misinformed.

Still, the headline makes it look like BTC is pro English Defense League. I think trying to tie BTC to white supremacists is generally a bad idea.

I'm 32 and have a degree in political science. You're either very old and dumb as nails or very young. Your little tirade chalk full of non sequiturs and random misinformation comes off as paranoid and strange.
