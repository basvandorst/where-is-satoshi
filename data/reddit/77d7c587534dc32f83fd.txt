Putting all in one bucket was not a good idea. People, start using alternatives. Like Tradehill or Bitcoin7.

the thing is BTC is deteriorating against USD at constant rate.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:49:39
3 months and 300 BTC? Really?
@_date: 2011-06-24 15:26:41
if anybody in Japan wants a 6990, I'm offering it for 6,7500 JPY, will ship via Yamato (Not Sagawa!). MSI, retail price of 71530 JPY, clean box with everything included. 
It has been running under 80℃ for two weeks.

How many PCs do you have in your mining farm, and what is average price for one PC?
Not related to the question, I jumped off, sold my gaming + photography rigs off, bought a 600 USD custom machine + RADEON 6990 spent what's rest on buying BTC, and I'm currently waiting for the rig to arrive. 
I can't believe I'm buying non-Mac computers. And I can't believe I bought it in nerd cave store. But this IS serious.

**YES**, I accept BTC but with increased handling fee to cover currency conversion fees.
But since I spent all my money buying rig for myself, I don't have any liquid money in my bank. 
Your payment will be used to fund your purchase at first (until I gain enough pool of cash in my bank to skip the waiting process.) Once I have enough cash in hand, I will be able to accept your payment MUCH quicker.
And to cover exchange fees, handling fee will rise to 33%. 
If this is okay for you, YES, we will have no problem with BTC purchase. 
BTC to USD --&gt; USD to JPY rate will be negotiated at point of purchase. Good thing BTC/USD market is stable now (as of June 10th).
**TL;DR: Yes, but handling fee will rise to 33% from 25%.  And it will take extra time.**
Also, I'm using VirWox to convert BTC to USD, and to PayPal. If anyone can tell me how I can cash out BTC to PayPal, I'd be happy to give you 5% discount.

actually I can get good quantity of that. after some digging i got following rate.
at rate of 1 JPY= 0.012488USD, 1 BTC = 25.8 USD,
 quote for	5850	, ship to	NY
			
	Original Price	29,663	JPY
	 *with shipping and handling 
	in USD	370.4253	USD
	in BTC	18.6648406976744	BTC
		
 quote for	5870	, ship to	NY
			
	Original Price 45,951	JPY
	 *with shipping and handling	
	in USD	573.83921	USD
	in BTC	28.9143787984496	BTC
			
			
[!] price may change depending on availability.
[!] shipment cost (4700JPY ) depends on where you live.

quote for	MSI 6970	, ship to	NY
			
	retail price	38,200	JPY
			
	handling fee	12,606	JPY
			
	shipping       	4,700	JPY
			
	-----------------------------	
			
	total          	55,506	JPY
at point of payment, I'll have google convert JPY to USD. And then to BTC. That will be the final price. At current rate, that'll be 
[55 506 Japanese yen = 693.158928 U.S. dollars](
[693.158928 USD / 25.80 = 26.8666251](
So that'll be 26.8666251 BTC.
Since nobody's been trying to convert BTC to JPY, there are lots of loose ends, and things may not work out as my math goes.
If I will lose money EVEN with 33% handling fee, I'll stop BTC offer - or raise the handling fee.
On the contrary, as I gain experience, I'll be able to lower the handling fee towards original 25%.
