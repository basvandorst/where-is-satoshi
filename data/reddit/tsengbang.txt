Null point. Simply proves Bitcoin.com has always been misleading and is significantly more misleading  today due to Ver. You missed the entire premise of the forum comment, which is a criticism of .com to .org

I read the article and the alleged document.  Without getting into too much detail, this is incredibly suspect. Looks completely fake to me.
1. Not a single source
2. May 31st is the date before Bitcoin Cash fork
3. Government could careless, nor do they know the difference between the two.
4. Document specifies "the United States" as the holistic body that represents their discretion. This is factually incorrect. Attorney Generals do not represent The nation state.
Conclusion: Fraudulent
Rule number one: Trust nobody. Fake news is rampant.

Because suddenly you have hundreds of people around you asking you if Bitcoin cash is a better Bitcoin and no matter what explanation I give them they don't understand. I'm trying to protect all the people. Bitcoin is about merit. Bitcoin cash is about exploitive pumps and Insider colluding

If someone presented you with medicine but instead gave you poison and you took it thinking it was the former because a third party inwhich you gave your full Trust in offered it, what do you think most retail investors would do? Blind buys

It was opened up to retail investors who only clicked buy on coinbase. They bought a can of worms.

More analogous to Cisco aiding in laying out networking infrastructure. The internet was built through L2/L3/L4 etc, similarly, Bitcoin will have these solutions built on top of it.

It's called a flash pump in a completely illiquid market, meaning there's 10 in demand and a 2 in sell side. Price action quickly fills ask volume and coinbase/GDAX bots post sell wall to catch the $9,500.

Yes. Things coexist. BTC and BCH can live and exist together in harmony. Roger Ver is a maniac. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:28:03
There's a difference between a concensus agreement and Roger Ver's divide and conquer mentality. Bitcoin should not be a civil war.

The construct of Bitcoin Cash.

Have you been living under a rock for this entire month? BCH supporters have been promoting and have orchestrated the complete takeover of the Bitcoin name and saying "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin".
