@_date: 2017-08-01 09:54:10
So they aim is to scale indefinitely? if so, it what increments? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:09:02
It's happaned!
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:10:12
Not sure how I even get my BCC..
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:26:23
I think it will be 9k... seems the logical number for both patterns. Here's praying for 32k tho.

They talking about IOTA then?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:47:22
such an intelligent and informative retort...
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:05:45
Serios question. What is the difficulty to mine now comparing BCH and BTC? is there still a backlog of BTC transactions?

Should stick to making movies..

literally no one knows what's going to happen post fork. Best to hedge.

When will it come into effect?
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:01:26
I'm selling one of my coins to see if I can make it 1.5 in a dip. Hopefully it plays out!

The Economist is actually really good. It's always had a left/liberal approach.

When is the deadline for Segwitx2?

I'm not really sure what the NPR is. The Economist over here in the UK might be different to your Economist. It tends to be ahead of the rest in terms of technology &amp; insight. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:38:58
That's what I thought. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:37:47
Thanks for this explanation. My main questions ( it may not have been suitable for this Sub) was regarding the impact on the price of BTC however. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:00:21
Please drop more so I can buy more
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:39:27
Perfect! Thanks!

Looks more like 18th of Nov though
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:58:27
Never heard of it, is it reputable? Have you used it before?
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:25:48
Fiat onramps for uk bank accounts? Coinbase isn't working?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:48:02
Good advice probably. But I'm going with my gut on this one. Could be completely wrong but based on the last fork situation I fancies taking a risk becasue after all BTC is still a risk! 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:31:11
So, if I withdraw my Bitcoin from my Coinbase account to my Electrum wallet will the be safe in the instance of a split? Or do I have to put them in a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:32:24
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:01:48
I know this is a semi jokey post but are you guys no worried about the scaling issues it may have? 
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:56:30
Whats is HODL!?
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:54:08
Wait, I have all my Bitcoin in an Elecrtum wallet. What does this mean for a newb like myself!
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:34:37
I'm really confused what implications this has for me. I have all my Bitcoin in an Electrum wallet. Am I all good?
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:06:29
Sorry, so having an Electrum wallet means I have my own private keys?
