Yea I'm not educated enough on the matter to be an authority on this but that was just my opinion. I feel like someone with enough bitcoin to fuck with a market this big would probably profit more by just letting it grow lol.
Btw what happened when we were at 1200$?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:30:56
A 140 billion dollar market would be pretty tough to manipulate
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:06:29
Damn this is good perspective

Is this a market correction or is this china banning bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:52:27
Yup pay day is tomorrow. The only bloodbath I foresee is the one in my wallet hahaha!
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:10:06
I'm sure people were saying the exact same 1 year ago.

yeaaa let me just close down this multi million dollar business VOLUNTARILY 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:43:44
I don't know why other people are so eager to tell others to join but I can tell you why I was. I was fucking excited I told all my friends to get into bitcoin, put it on my snapchat, told my mom and my aunt, told my coworkers cause I was fucking excited about getting in this train SUPER EARLY. Just trying to share the wealth.

Hey man people were saying the same shit when it was worth $500 in 2014. I agreed with you and thought it was a scam. Look at it now.  I'm not making the same mistake twice. Check back in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:57:38
lol you think I'm some dude behind a desktop in Russia trying to scam people or something? I mean it's on the news more and more everyday. You got big bank CEOs talking about it. I'll see you when we hit 10 grand.

Bear market. Everything is "cheap". Had he bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was 4900$ it would have been real bad timing in comparison. This will all be chump change when we're at 20 grand in the nearby future though ��

@_date: 2017-10-02 23:45:05

@_date: 2017-10-13 07:41:02

@_date: 2017-09-24 19:15:26
