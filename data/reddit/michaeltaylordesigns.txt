Also here is a comment from  that pretty much sums it up..
For those of you who don't know who Craig Wright is:
* Craig Wright listed a PhD in computer science from Charles Sturt University on his LinkedIn profile. But the university told Forbes that it only awarded him two master's degrees and not a [doctorate.](
* In 2004, Wright was convicted of contempt of court by the [Supreme Court of New South Wales.]( He was sentenced to 28 days in jail for breaching an injunction that prevented him from approaching customers of DeMorgan Information Security Systems, which he resigned from in 2003. The sentence was suspended on condition of performing 250 hours of community service. After appealing the decision, the ruling was upheld in 2005 and also in a subsequent appeal to the [High Court of Australia]( in 2006. [More info here]( 
* He is the founder of the cyber security and computer forensics company Panopticrypt Pty Ltd
* Wright was the CEO of the technology firm [Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Group]( which planned to launch Denariuz Bank, the world's first bitcoin-based bank, though it encountered [regulatory difficulties]( with the Australian Tax Office and [failed]( in 2014.
* 2 May 2016, Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of bitcoin. [Link here]( [here]( and [here](
* His claim to be the creator of Bitcoin was debunked, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky in his blog concluded Wright's claim was a scam. Craig Wright confirmed that he would provide extraordinary [proof](
* His "extraordinary proof" was that he claimed he would sign a message with the 'satoshi's keys'-- but what he provided was a copy of the signature extracted from the second transaction in the blockchain, wrapped in layers of obfuscation to make it seem like it was a signature of a message he provided.
It was thoroughly debunked shortly after posting it (This point compliments of **Edit**
* He then posted a statement on his [site]( which has since been expunged:
 &gt; I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot. When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this. I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen. I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry. And goodbye.
