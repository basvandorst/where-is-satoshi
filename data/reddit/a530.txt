I think it's fair to assume that the government knew who he was all along.  If he's using his real name, he was basically hiding in plain sight.  It's not exactly hard for the NSA or FBI to find someone that used to be on the company payroll.

It won't be an excuse if someone comes after them criminally and with Mt Gox having US customers, Kerpeles and the rest of the crew have a huge legal liability on their hands.

I just saw the video and they don't even ask for notarized documents... that's odd but then again, they are in the US, which is stupid.  I would be expecting them to require notarized docs that in the future, just to be sure FinCEN doesn't slap them around.  
If the documents you provided are in sync with their current requirements, then something strange is going on, like they can't find your originals.  I have over a decade of experience in the virtual currency business and can't recall ever having to go back and ask for docs to be re-submitted because the docs are no longer valid.  
If it was me, I would tell them to liquidate your account and send the proceeds via check to the name on the account and close your account immediately.   Stay far away from BTC companies incorporated in the US or foreign companies that accept US customers, it's just too risky.

Well, it's not like he's able to get a bank account at this point.  Every bank account Mt. Gox has had is most likely closed or seized.

Over the years, I've seen this more times than I can care to count.  If an exchanger, market maker, virtual currency or platform that processes customer funds delays withdrawals and payouts from liquidations, the company is on it's death bed.  
When Mt. Gox had their accounts seized but the DOJ, they were done and have been treading water ever since.  These problems are a result of their seizure and nothing they say will make me believe otherwise.
Don't use any BTC companies that are domiciled in the US or have US customers.

What kind of documents did they have you verify previously?  If they are telling you that you need to provide different types of documents, it could be that they have been told, from a legal standpoint, that they need to improve their KYC policies. This kind of thing happens as regulatory requirements evolve. 
If they are asking you to send in the same type of documents, it either could mean that they lost the ones you sent or they need to slow down the rate of withdrawals (this happens when companies are on their way out).  
I don't know Bitstamp's KYC policies but you should have provided two forms of identification (usually high quality scans of a passport photo and utility bill) that has been notarized by a legal notary.  
If they lost your original docs, I would be pressing them very hard to tell me where they went.  
Personally, I wouldn't touch a Bitcoin company domiciled in the US (or a company that has US customers) with a 10 foot pole.  The formula works out something like this...US Virtual Currency LLC. + US Department of Treasury's FinCEN + FBI = COMPLETE BUSINESS FAILURE

Except for the fact that they're in a jurisdiction that doesn't care (Japan), and the laws governing the business they're engaging in don't exist.

That's the problem in this space, apart from a very few people in this industry, most people running these things have very little experience in virtual currency exchanges.
With that in mind, what has happened at Mt. Gox is like amateur hour.  First of virtual currency exchanges is...YOU DON'T ALLOW US CUSTOMERS.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:21:09
Yes, it's not an issue in the US because individuals with that much money are smart enough to have a security detail accompanying them.  There's a reason why the physical security business is a profitable concept.

Mt. Gox's model, like most exchange models, require float or reserve accounts to facilitate speedy conversions, liquidations, etc.  The DOJ seizure could have wiped out their ability to process transactions quickly.  
Their model may not a ponzi but if they're reserves are gone (which is what appears to be the case), as an exchanger, they could move into insolvency pretty damn quickly.

They're headquartered in the UK because unlike the US, the UK has extensive regulatory guidance around e-money and you can even get a license to be an e-money issuer through the FCA.  The US is in the stone ages when it comes to virtual currency regulations and has a long, long history of coming down on these types of companies.  
You can be domiciled in the UK but if you accept US customers, you open yourself up to the 800lb gorilla that is the US government.  With the confusing state and federal regulatory requirements around this vertical (virtual currencies are MUCH different than check cashing liquor stores), it's a huge gamble to do business in the US.  
Look at what happened with Neteller...it's the same reason why Moneybookers would NEVER touch US customers.  The US can and will seize a UK company's accounts...creating the kind of delays everyone saw with Mt. Gox.

This same story has been playing out since 2001.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:59:22
Bingo, this is exactly what is going on.  I don't think this is arbitrage, I think this is them throttling the payouts.  
IMO, the DOJ seizure has made them insolvent.

Trust me, I'm about 99.9% sure that he's had the DOJ crawling up his ass for the last couple of years.  If there isn't one already done, there's probably a grand jury indictment in the works as we speak.  By engaging US customers, he opened himself up to all kinds of US regulatory compliance requirements like the BSA and Patriot Act.  
You don't move the kind of money Mt. Gox did and not have the IRS, FBI, SEC and CFTC all running a full court press on you.

They won't need to write a book.  There's a bunch of virtual currencies and exchanges that came WAY before MTGox that have all failed (Neteller, e-Gold, OSGold, etc).  The problem is, the morons that run these new companies never look at history and the reasons why they failed in the first place.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:24:29
I have years of experience in building and running these kind of exchanges and IMO, your theory is probably spot on.  
It's very likely that the automation the built into the business processes, one that reissued dead transactions, allowed them to get over a hump but erroneously masked their losses.  
I've also been saying that the DOJ problems caused other issues bigger than what has appeared...perhaps it wiped out their reserve accounts and their ability to process withdrawals near realtime.
Whoever their CFO is/was should be running scared because they seemed to be asleep at the wheel.
