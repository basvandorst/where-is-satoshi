Okay. Fair enough. What about those miners who use dirt cheap coal to power their mining operation? They exist as well. Crypto isn't only powered by excess hydro energy and even part of that will end because China wants to shut down miners and connect their new power plants to the grid.

People want to trust institutions and feel safe that their money is protected and in case of fuckups there are always chargebacks, transactions are reversible and layers upon layers of professional protection are always in place including protection from user's own inability. I do not see any potential for a revolution for a trustless system in a society that is built around trust and craves simplicity and comfort. Most people are not and will not be comfortable with BYOB vision ever.

Okay I understand this argument that mining could move to places that have more energy than they use. Provided governments will not crack down on miners like they did in China because they dislike the fact that someone is using excess energy on solving useless puzzles. And provided miners will actually move their ass there and not just eat energy coming from burning cheap coal in India or some other country.
But I'd also like to comment on this post of yours.


Yeah, I'm not sure you're in position to call another people retarded.
There is no such thing as free energy and there is no such thing as clean energy.
Hydro damages local ecosystems.
Wind kills birds.
Solar requires rare metal mining which produces pollution.
All of them also have a carbon footprint rooted in gathering resources, production, transportation, construction and maintenance. Their net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of nonrenewable power sources but they are not zero.

My point is the meltdown will be epic, some exchanges will go under and weaken the entire crypto economy and the FUD will go off the charts. Think Bitconnect scam but more panic everywhere. And the PR for crypto could be so bad we could possibly see these things:
* Hasty regulations of governments pressed by hosed investors and scaremongers which may or may not be good
* Long term bear market
* Huge damage of crypto image for years to come
* The FUD will cause even bitcoin to drop in price, who knows how much
* Trust in the ecosystem will drop to historical low
I think it would be best for everyone if this thing blew up immediately. 
There's a grenade lying on the floor and someone has to fall on it and absorb the damage soon otherwise everyone will get the shrapnel in their face.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:38:51
Yes. Someone is printing thin air money and buying bitcoin with it for free actually. 2 billion of worthless trash already pumped into the system. 2 billion of hot potatoes people and some exchanges juggle every day and the moment tether goes to 0 is the moment everyone holding it becomes a bag holder instead. During the last crash people ran away to buy tether and store their value there, at least temporarily. So during that bloodbath some people bought a lot of bitcoin and some got a lot of tether. But if similar thing happens AND tether becomes worthless there isn't any safe instrument to hunker down anymore. 
Some exchanges may go under. Alt markets may collapse. The fear will be off the charts. Normal exchanges that deal with USD will shut down to prevent bank run. It may be a next Mt. Gox type of cataclysmic event. Or it may not. But every day these assholes are free to suck more real value out of the system the damage is compounding.

I remember at the time the mainstream argument about volatility was to not worry about it because once the mainstream will become interested in it the price will plateau and then stabilize and we will live happily ever after with our stable, powerful and very slowly growing deflationary currency. And now look what happened. As more people got in speculation has gone wild and the price swings are way higher than they used to be. 
But still there was a time when fees were low and people were excited it could be used as a genuine currency with less regulation and more freedom. As to why would you spend....well that's what money is for. Stores started to look into bitcoin and accept it, companies started to deploy atms, black market used it widely for black market things... Rapidly bursting activity and entire bussinesses built on this concept and mainstream actors slowly getting comfortable with the idea of accepting it and accomodating it.

Okay let's say the p2p currency function will never work and it will remain a store of value. How many people have to worry about that scenario? Not many. Most of them are either criminals who use bitcoin (nobody cares about them) or people in unstable/undemocratic 3rd world countries.
How many people who live in those countries could actually use bitcoin to save their remaining wealth in case of collapse of the state or during dangerous times? How many could afford to pay the equivalent of their monthly wage or higher to take the fee damage not only when they get in but also every time they want to make a transaction with someone and when they cash out?

How did you count this 26.4 million? It shows there are around 31 million addresses with nonzero balance.  As for wallets they either misunderstood individual addresses as wallets or it's just a coincidence those numbers are similar and they probably used some kind of metric related to verified downloads of wallets from various places.
Edit: my bad, I actually miscounted because I looked at the data the wrong way. You're correct.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:45:04
I don't know. I haven't researched it that deeply. Go ahead and knock yourself out if you wish. What I know is people can use it as a mean of fast, reliable and cheap medium of exchange and as an escape from fiat hyperinflation AND that they can't really use bitcoin for any of that at the moment. 
Bitcoin is not anything it promised to be, it's a broken speculative investment scheme. How can it help people in poor countries if the fees are as expensive as their monthly wage or higher right now? How can it be a reliable place to hide your wealth from the government if it's so unreliably volatile that you have to wait until the price is at least back to the point you originally bought to get back your money?
Ask yourself one question. Do you think general public cares how it works? No, they don't care about blockchain or cryptographic security or decentralized ledger only care how practical it is to them. If the corpocrypto (no such phrase on google, I invented it, neat :D) turns out to be more practical for the general public they're gonna dump bitcoin and visa alike and switch even if it won't be as secure and as independent as regular cryptocurrencies.
I am still impressed you can swallow that bitter pill, many crypto enthusiasts would find it hard to acknowledge that the future may not turn out to be their happy, libertarian version without fiat and bad banks and government control but (as often) a mix of various ideas, solutions and compromises instead. Many people here already exhibit a really magical thinking that is unable to compromise with exisiting reality (bitcoin is not gonna challenge fiat anytime soon, it's not even a currency now) and future developments (or lack thereof) will hit them like a truck IMHO.

Ok. I only follow bitcoin news once in a while so I am still a bit confused what is exactly happening. Last time I checked it was supposed to be decentralized, free currency that enabled people to transfer value almost charge free and fast across the entire planet with slowly but healthily growing commerce. 
Nowadays it's a hoarding asset with hardcore fees which disincentivize spending and even transferring from point a to b. It just seems to be completely different thing than it was in the past. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:59:27
So let me ask you this. Let's say I go to the grocery store ABC 2 times every week and buy stuff for average amount of X. If I want to make transactions with this store for the whole year without fees do I have to tie amount of money that represents 104 equivalents of X beforehand? And the merchant can't close the channel and get his money before we're done? That's not super convenient I must admit.

I understand but look at it from another perspective. For one good opportunity there are hundreds of bad ones. For one bitcoin investor that succeeeds there are thousands of suckers who got themselves sucked in some Amway type crap or some shady investment scheme balls deep that cripples them for years. It is rational to avoid dubious opportunities if your time is limited and you don't know which one is good and which bad. For average people it is just economical to stay away from danger and uncertainty, especially from highly complex issues.
I know people with families, kids. People who have to work their ass off and then take care of their kids when they get back home, they have just about enough time and strength to deal with everyday problems and irregular issues that come up now and then. They won't investigate and explore the world sufficiently to go to "another level". But I also understand your point. If you try encourage them to listen to something interesting and new they are already entrenched in their daily life so much they don't have the patience to hear about new things they don't understand and get bored easily. I don't blame them though but it is frustrating. Every time I talk about something impressive I feel like I'm banging my head on the wall and just barely get through.
For example my coworkers are really old fashioned and find it really hard to understand the magnitude of change that self driving cars will bring in our lifetime. They live in denial thinking it won't even happen during their time (it already happened, they can drive by themselves but they are not polished from technical and legal standpoint **yet**) and it won't affect them or their jobs/families.

@_date: 2017-12-23 10:44:53
It's not decentralized and it's not exactly another fiat money. If their currency goes to shit even further this internet token stays still and saves value. Tbh I haven't delved enough into crypto tech to be the judge what is or isn't crypto. However the general public loves it and in the end they will be dictating whether cryptos will succeed in the long run or maybe be replaced by something much more convenient and tailored (and possibly not decentralized) to their financial and banking needs. Cryptos are not only competing with themselves and fiat. They are also competing with future solutions made by people who actually have fuckton ofresources and capital to get an edge.
I mean it all makes sense. In a thread yesterday some developer guy admitted that even though he is great enthusiast if he was at work and was dealing with rapidly growing market and said scaling solutions of their product will be operational within 18+ months he'd be fired on the very same day.
Once the big money finally understands the stakes and enters the game it might be very difficult for non profit projects like cryptos to succeed. Millions of people enjoy the benefits of eco cash and when the big capital enters the game and spends billions on a product that makes EcoCash (that is vastly more useful, safe and usable than bitcoin in the scope of Zimbabwe society) look like a bitch then they may make cryptos run for their money simply due to popular demand. What if the future is mainstream corporate cryptos? It can't be ruled out and the general public doesn't care about things that make bitcoin great and technical details.

I have similar things OP. Unfortunately all these dreams were lost to greed and speculation and nowadays everyone has a stake in this game and wants the bitcoin price to go higher and higher which doesn't necessarily transfer to success.
So many people are emotionally invested in winning bick bucks and are only thinking about money while the original idea is lost. In fact most of fresh blood is probably fixated on getting rich quick and doesn't give a damn about white paper or the purpose of bitcoin. Merchants lost interest in bitcoin and all the adoption and progress we had before was wasted. Nobody wants to buy stuff with bitcoin anymore. Nowadays it's an e-gold, not the currency of the future...
Personally I'd love the volatility to go and the price stabilize (no matter how high and low, could be 30 thousand, could be 30 bucks). 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:34:02
Yeah, giving paper wallets to people who are not tech savvy, have no idea how to operate bitcoin network nor are familiar with cybersecurity issues regarding bitcoin and are probably not even equipped with knowledge and understanding what exactly they are even holding (many people will not take it seriously and then forget about it, or think this is some kind of joke) is totally not a recipe for disaster...
If anything, a much better gift would be giving the knowledge a giver has about bitcoin and then once the person they're talking to is interested then giving them some bitcoin, not in reverse. That's just common sense, not some rocket science.

Don't trust, verify. Exchanges should be more transparent, not less. They have a lot of power and are opaque organisations with hardly any safeguarads against abuse. They can front run their customers, engage in wash trading and insider trading. They can wreck their own margin trading customers with "random outages" (hello Arthur). They can confiscate their funds for whatever bullshit reason and hold them hostage for months, dedicated exchange subs are full of disgruntled or desperate customers who were wronged in some way. In a free market without regulation and oversight you're goddamn right I would treat them as guilty until proven otherwise because there's nothing stopping them from doing shitty things. The only question should be how many shitty things they do and how bad they are.

I think there is some misunderstanding here or you're responding to someone else. I mean every thread of this kind ends up with lots of hindsight how stupid it was to give bitcoin as a present, people lost their private keys and wallets because they didn't take those gifts seriously or had no fkin idea wtf was it, it was a joke to them and forgot about it completely.
In 99.9% of those cases the fault lies in the giver of those gifts because this type of gift is useless without a good amount of specific and technical knowledge and usually it's cringey as fuck and christmas shouldn't be about giving someone motherfucking money anyway.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:09:56
False equivalence. Shorters simply believe the asset is inflated and price is too irrational and needs correction and want to profit from that discrepancy. If they're wrong they are punished and need to buy at bigger price than they sold, sometimes there is too many of them and it ends in short squeeze so they are punished even more while boosting everyone else's holdings. In crypto there is a limit in form of collateral so you can't get more rekt than just rekt but in traditional assets you can get even more rekt if shit gets real.
If they're correct they simply profit from realizing the inevitable sooner than the rest. I don't think there is anything unfair here. You can't bet on your neighbour suffering but you can bet on assets being ridiculous. Do you think shorting Theranos or Enron or Pets.com would be an evil thing too?

Yes buyer beware thingy really worked well in Albania when collapse of multiple nation wide pyramids led to social unrest and civil war. 
Even if we can't protect all people from scammers and conmen there is no excuse to not prohibit their destructive behavior and pursue those bastards to the ends of the earth and make them pay for ruining thousands of lives. If anything, white collar crimes that can wipe out life savings and years of work of millions can be far more destructive than a single assault and battery and should be punished more severly. Punishment is not a perfect deterrent but better something than nothing. I'm glad Madoff got 150 years, he managed to trick institutional investors and benevolent organisations, not an average suckers and got what he deserved.

Hardly. If you ban mining in a country miners will move to another country. If you ban or discourage mining in multiple countries they will move to a smaller subset of viable countries.

The most hardcore example is Venezuela. They use various methods to sniff the miners out. They have police division tracking the energy usage (pretty hard to mask this if your machines eat up energy, huh), blackmailing people into ratting on each other. They confiscate their equipment without recourse when they find mining operations and confiscate imported miners on the spot.
I suppose you could mine shitcoins with your GPU but then again if your operation is big you could be tracked down and if your operation is tiny you won't earn much.

Why do you conflate safety standards in medicine that are placed so that people won't get cancer or die due to badly researched product with pointing a gun at someone else's head? You take away those time consuming processes you'll get talidomids left and right because companies will try to one up each other to make the least possible effort to research their drugs (possibly doing all clinical research in 3rd world countries where are less rigorous standards, they are already doing this a bit) and maximize profits consequences be damned. There were some really extreme fuckups in the medicine world that could've produced lasting consequences for generations. Thus the need for extreme cautiousness is championed.


With that kind of philosphy you can't trust any government and any institution to do its best to help their people. Corruption exist and there are abuses of power but we have institutions to combat them endlessly. If there is no trust in those institutions or if they are clearly compromised then there is no point in government at all and it must be replaced, preferably immediately. Sometimes it comes down to this and it's desirable.
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:41:01
Then by this logic fallen states where government is weak or barely functioning and has no power over its territories should be places where free market forces fluorish unimpeded by force and regulations. In reality they are hellholes where local warlords with their thug squads rape, steal, kill, mutilate, enslave and do as they're please while they're busy fighting or dealing with another warlords. 
Every time there's a power vacuum humans want to fill it with something, whether it's a group that cooperates in order to protect themselves and prosper or perhaps even conquer or an ambitious individual who assembles others under his leadership and strength the human race naturally is gravitating towards hierarchical structures and higher orders of organisation over time. You can't change that. Whether it's dictatorship or democracy, hierarchy exists and anarchy is unnatural state. Even primitive tribes have chieftain who makes decisions, shaman/wise old men who advise him forming some sort of government. Delete government and you'll get another one sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:03:20
Medicine is a problem. You just can't take away hugely expensive and time consuming, complex processes that ensure the pills we take are safe and deregulate them or you'll end up with fuckups like talidomid on a daily basis. Some industries aren't simply for small fires anymore because our standards changed and they'll only get higher and more demanding in time.
The alternative of deregulation of industries and removal of safety standards is a return to stuff like radium girls.

There is also another factor. Nice, round numbers are psychological barriers. 10k is a nice border and some people may decide this is their exit point. Also there is one more thing to consider. At every thousand there are hordes of bagholders who bought too late and are underwater now, eagerly awaiting next price spike to get out without losses, break even and escape the bear land. Before any serious bull run you need to pay for losers who bought at 11k, 12k, 13k, 14k, 15k, 16k, 17k, 18k, 19k, 20k, and even supreme losers who paid kimchi premium up to 23k. Every thousand is a battle of attrition against those that got burned and want to exit the system without loss. Consider that.

The last time there was a huge economical crisis in US the whole world felt it and there was a significant recession, not only in US. If US dollar, a currency tied to the largest economy on the planet collapsed you'd seen economical apocalypse of the unprecedented proportions and the consequences would be biblical. The whole world is conneted now and so are economies. During the last crisis people were selling their assets and I imagine in such a scenario there could be a bank run on cryptocurrencies and other saving assets because when your economy has shit the bed you need money to buy stuff you can't afford anymore because you lost your job because your company has declared bankruptcy or due to lay offs and suddenly your financial security will be bad if many people suffered the same fate. 
People would panic sell their shit because they'd be scared others may do so as well, it doesn't matter how many will really need their savings immediately, what matters is how many will be scared nobody will buy their bags at the right price anymore due to recession. Yeah, I imagine it would be interesting to watch.

Private sector demonstrates that at times it is utterly incapable of self policing when there is competitive advantage on the line and everyone tries to one up each other. 
This reminds me of a discussion with a guy who worked at bank. He said he worked there during housing crisis and some banks were actually begging government to regulate them more (!!!) while the whole house of cards was being built because they were afraid that the endless cycle of ever increasing competitive search for short term profit will end badly and they couldn't police themselves because the moment some entities would try to act more responsibly the others would not and thus giving them advantage that the former couldn't ignore and all parties got fucked in the end in an endless spiral of shortsighted profit seeking. How do you make that better and fairer? You'll end up with prisoner dilemma without widely accepted and enforced standards.

You will find out pretty quickly that bitcoin fans are often libertarians, classical liberals, right wingers or ancaps who dislike governments, authorities, taxes, regulation and are pretty much pro maximum individualism, unrestricted liberty and very far reaching concept of personal responsibility (with some cases radical enough to be pro absolute liberty with no oversight whatsoever, social consequences be damned).
It's not very close to a left wing perspective and depending on the region and the left wing flavor it may be seen either as a selfish game, a dangerous scheme devised to avoid regulation, taxes and state control, a haven for money launderers and other criminals, a hideout for social outcasts running from responsibilities or simply a waste of resources and environmental disaster.

This seems like a very safe way to make lots of money. Take one smooth talker who is able to easily earn people's trust and once you found your golden goose you signal your buds in balaclavas who will tail your prey, work out their schedule and ambush them at the worst possible time and place. It already happened to some people and been reported in the media, they were attacked and forced to hand over their keys/wallets and the guys who did this weren't the kind you'd like to bluff to or hand some throwaway address with some scraps. They weren't some two bit hooligans, they were armed, prepared, very informed and ready to do some very nasty stuff if they found you uncooperative.

You're asking for an investment advice on a forum full of overenthusiastic people who often display a disregard for risk and encourage reckless behavior. There is also a conflict of interest because everyone has skin in the game and must convince themselves and others their decision (irregardless of whether it's sound or not at the time) is never wrong. 
Do you expect people here to say "no, it's fucking stupid, save your meagre funds to slowly build your financial safety net that will save your ass when some random incident will disrupt your security or goals"? Of course not. They'll say "Do it, go all in!". Ask yourself is this the best place to seek sound investment advice? You want to just speculate a bit? It's your money and your loss or win, good luck. You want to invest? Prepare to think critically and do your research. No, asking here to get some bullish hype responses  is not research unless you're just looking for validation in which case you will get it promptly.
What is smart idea? [Reading carefully this post written by mod that was stickied during the peak of the hype is a good start.]( 
What is stupid idea? Asking here if you should blindly speculate on a very volatile asset on the most predatory market on the planet with a history of manipulation and shady actors with substantial portion of your current earnings is a stupid idea.
What you need is to critically exame your goals and your current condition.
1. Do you have a basic financial safety net that will ensure you will be able to handle random disasters when your life shits the bed? If not, build it immediately. I don't care if you have no expenses, live in your parent's basement and they pay for everything. Life can shit the bed at any time, you need to be able to handle random situations with a flick of the fingers. If your situation is more safe you still should have some money for less important FUBARS, if you can, good, this is a first step towards financial safety.
2. Do you have **any** kind of savings that you can pull out in case good opportunities arise? I remember a post some time ago on coinbase subreddit of a mother that lamented and wailed that there was a problem with her coinbase account and transfer of funds and she couldn't withdraw her money quickly because she had all of her savings (lol) on coinbase and there was a flash sale with a laptop she could buy for her children birthday for about a third of a price. Of course coinbase had to shit the bed and she lost excellent opportunity that would save her a lot of money on this goal. The children were devastated and so was she. Don't be like her.
Also people often spend too much on things they want **now** because instant gratification is easy and nice but not save enough to afford things they could buy cheaper at a later time. Or they buy shitty things over and over because they break more often instead of buying one good thing that will last them much longer if they saved. But people don't want to pay more for quality sometimes, it's a mistake. This gives you advantage and saves your money. If you don't have opportunity money (and I don't care what your goal is, whether it's a car, or new printer, or a very nice pair of shoes) you are already losing son. You are losing and you're not even aware of it. Be aware.
5. Do you have any kind of savings that you can lock in for a longer time frame that you don't want to pull out at a moment's notice but you can move them should there be an absolute necessity? I assume not, not at this time of your life. But it's good to have at least some.
If you answered yes for all of those questions however, congratulations, you may have enough financial security to begin investing and maybe even speculating on risky instruments with a portion of your portfolio. Sounds boring? Welcome to investing, you've barely arrived at the starting line, if you didn't answer yes to every one of them you should invest in your financial security ASAP. I don't care you have no expenses, that's even better, build your future from the beggining and you will be better off than your peers that waste their money on newest iphone or some other stupid shit and lament they can't afford really nice things when it really matters. Invest in your financial safety net first, invest in yourself ASAP, then after you're safe and comfy, ready to push a button and snatch a good opportunity at any time you want and you have some nice additional savings (relative really) then you're ready for high seas. And even then you need to spread the risk and diversify. 
But before that, no, it's fucking stupid. Investing isn't about jumping at every promise of getting rich quick. No matter how good the promise may seem. Financial security and investing in yourself will never fail.

But this logic could apply to any industry that uses energy. Show me any industry that wouldn't want cheaper energy over more expensive energy and that would be incentivised to get the best deal. Take Facebook for example. They chose to deploy their datacenter in artcic because cooling fuckton of computers is easier in a cold climate. My question is simple, how are bitcoin miners any special over any other businessmen incentivised to search for the most efficient option for their industrial grade operations?  They're not special.  Any energy intensive business is doing the same, right?

I'd rather buy the coin directly rather than buy panels and miners and cooling and shit and bear the costs of the whole infrastructure for the sake of doing the same thing but with much more effort and much bigger risks. Especially since I'm not a huge fucking warehouse in the middle of China so if the price dumps I can't compete with their 2 cents for kwh. But they can, they don't care. Sure, their margins suck and are less fabulous but they'll survive. Meanwhile smaller scale miners mine in the red or get fucked and shut down their operations before they incur more losses. Many did already.
If you're not a huge fucking miner that works on industrial grade and gets industrial grade rates and industrial grade benefits from ecnomies  of scale you're competing with them on retail level, on uneven ground and you're basically making a lot of effort to buy bitcoin. Well, shit. If you're not a big player you might as well buy the fucking bitcoin and not bear the costs of investing huge amounts of money in venture that might not be worth it if you're gonna be outcompeted by rich professionals or if the price dumps or you your miners become worthless because new hot shit enters the market and so on.

@_date: 2018-10-30 19:49:20
Exactly. Hence it doesn't matter what kind of equipment you use. A gpu, an ASIC or dyson sphere alien supercomputer. In the end the equilibrium of energy cost vs total reward is the only metric of energy consumption.

Well, there is one thing to consider. Industries tend to work towards greater efficiency so that they will spend less energy to produce same quality of service or same amount of products. If you spend 1x energy to make y amount of products and your competitor finds a way to optimize the process and spend 0.8x amount of energy to make y amount of products they're better than you.
Bitcoin network on the other hand will continue to work the same and provide  the same quality of service whether it consumes 1% of world's energy, 0.01% of world's energy or whether it burns 1 solar system per year. There is no other industry on this planet that works that way. It's because bitcoin isn't inefficient per se, it's actually anti efficient by design.
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:49:52
Efficiency of equipment is not the issue. Doesn't matter whether you can achieve X hashing power with equipment that uses 1 kilowatt, half of that or even 1 thousandth. Consumption of energy is the issue and it will progressively grow to reach equilibrium when reward from mining equals costs of mining. If today someone released a product that mines 10 times cheaper than current ASICS people would keep buying it and adding more hashing power (which is less energy intensive) until equilibrium is nearly reached again and the same amount of electricity is used again. Therefore the efficiency of the entire network is only dependent on the relation of mining costs vs mining rewards. 
For example let's assume network currently uses enough energy to almost reach equilibrium as cost to mine 1 bitcoin is very close to reward. Let's say it costs 6000 to mine 1 bitcoin and you get about 6500 for 1 bitcoin. If the price jumped to 19500 tommorow and stayed there a long time the energy consumption would start to go up because now you pay only 6000 for 19500 worth of bitcoins so the race to add more hashing power and mine cheap bitcoins begins. Rewards justify adding more hashing power until you spend nearly 19500 for electricity. 
If the price went to 65000 the network could afford up to 10 times more electricity costs. And the miners would add more and more hashing power until it's no longer profitable.
Respectively it works the other way. If the price dropped to a third of that, say 2000 now miners pay 6000 for electricity to mine 2000 worth of bitcoin so some miners will need to turn off their equipment. Price and mining reward (currently 1800 btc per day) dictate the energy expenditure, nothing else. Doesn't matter if you invent an equipment that mines 10000 more efficient than current products, people will just use more and more of it until the reward is close to electricity cost. If the price won't change you'll just add a lot of hashing power and consume the same amount of electricity as those less efficient asics which added less.

You never get heads up that you will be attacked. Unless you have weapon on you you're dead in the water if they catch you by surprise. And they will, it's the whole point. In the scope of surprise attacks guns are mostly useless, yes.
Normal people don't have a gun within arm's reach all the time. If you have gun on you then depending on situation you may have a few seconds to react before you're overwhelmed and outnumbered or your family members are threatened and resistance is not optimal anymore. You need to act fast but even if you fire and disable an opponent there is no guaranetee that one of the robbers won't fire back and injure or kill you and your family. Thus unless you have a gun with you ready to fire then it's over if you're dealing with targeted break in and not some desperate junkie who wants to steal your cash and jewellery.

Thank you for detailed answer. The problem of motivation is not easily addressed.


There are numerous threads on this sub about people who gifted their relatives sums of bitcoin, some of them even nontrivial and after a while it turned out it was a terrible, terrible mistake. For some reason intangible assets like crypto are not taken as seriously as more traditional money and there is the whole premise of big trusted institution that got your back so you don't have to lose sleep over some cracks in your defenses.


Yes, people can figure it out, it's not a rocket science and stuff like wallets and transactions and other features gets less arcane over time. This issue is easily addressed. What is rarely addressed is the crucial problem I mentioned in the first post. Having your savings in immutable system requires impeccable opsec. 
It doesn't matter that you know how to transact with your bitcoins and don't do fat finger mistakes or simple fuckups. All it takes is visiting wrong website, downloading wrong software, being redirected to a wrong place, unknowingly being infected with malware, in short doing one of the thousand possible small mistakes that could lead to complete irreversible loss of funds. 
It doesn't matter that you're careful most of the time, it doesn't matter that you did nothing wrong, sometimes even not doing anything wrong doesn't save you, people got their 2FA fucked up and they thought they were safe behind it, they weren't. I saw posts in crypto subs where people posted their tragedies and sometimes they explained how painfully detailed and paranoid they were with their security and it still failed. The responses that tried to dissect the issue and deduce the attack vector sometimes were so complicated and technical my brain hurt. The average person will never be ready for this nor will they want to be exposed to this kind of responsibility and risk. The premise that they will choose trusted institution to fall back on will remain a timeless fact until proven otherwise with extraordinary evidence. 
You can change yourself but it's hard to change others. If you were able to convince general public to abandon convenience, safety and trust of modern finance and take the wheel themselves you'd not only be in sales, you'd be the purveyor of a completely new paradigm.

Using this logic you can justify bying a bit of every single cryptocurrency in existence. Maybe one of the Alts will be the killer. Even you hate alts you need to admit that no one knows what the future holds. So there is no way of knowing if one of them may dominate one day or not.
This is why Pascal's wager is stupid. The amount of religions (or in this case coins) is way more than one so you need to hedge on every single one of them just in case or this argument doesn't make any sense. And buying a bit of every single coin in existence and every future ones including upcoming ICOs is financially retarded. Like building a vast portfolio of penny stocks. Before you say that buying every single coin is doing it wrong... who is to say some new coin isn't going to be a killer in the future? The possibility is nonzero.

No, the average person is not too dumb. The root cause is elsewhere. The average person is unwilling to dedicate an extended period of time to acquire technical aptitude and cybersecurity knowledge to successfully secure their funds. Look at the average internet users, why is modern design "dumbed down" and most options hidden under the hood? Because average user isn't concerned with this and doesn't have to be.
The cybersecurity knowledge of average Joe is abysmal because they don't need to be IT specialists to secure their money, they can delegate this task to their bank/cc company. If someone shits the bed there are safeguards and safety mechanisms that protect. People won't be eager to be their own banks for the same reason they aren't their own car mechanics, gynecologists, barbers, plumbers and so on. The division of labor. Now some are eager and able to be their own plumbers or car mechanics for example, doesn't change the fact that most people aren't, everyone decides what the want to do with their free time and what knowledge and skills to acquire.
I will give you an example that I often give in these kind of discussions. Why safety, convenience and being ludicrously idiotproof is P A R A M O U N T when dealing with average Joes? 
Some time ago my coworker's husband typed wrong password into her bank account and he panicked and kept typing it wrong again and again (I'd bet 10 bucks he had capslock on) and the system locked him out. So she had to spend roughly 2 hours calling bank and going through every step of indentification and verification process with several separate calls and multiple questions on the way to getting new password.
In the middle she failed that process a couple of times because she was angry, impatient and nervous and also inexperienced when it comes to this type of stuff (she had to enter new password, get some verification code through sms and also something else and she kept messing the whole thing up). After 2 hours she gave up and finished the whole thing at home. But of course helpful customer service patiently explained the same shit over and over until eventually she managed to unlock her account. Some people may think she may be an idiot but she's painfully average when it comes to this stuff like my other coworkers.
Now how do you convince someone who has no idea what adblock is to give up the convenience, security and massive safety of being serviced by a bank with its own array of security measures, army of IT specialists, customer service reps ready to deal with your bullshit at a moment's notice, security guards and helpful procedures that undo fuckups/reverse fraudulent transactions to be her own bank and be exposed to all kinds of risks of having all of your stuff stolen or lost?
You can't, that's impossible. People who think mainstream will do this BYOB shtick are delusional beyond comprehension because they have no idea what mainstream needs or wants. They don't want their fees to be fractions of a penny, they don't want some anti government libertarian money, they don't want to be their own bank and have the responsibility of being constantly vigilant and dealing with consequences of even the smallest mistakes. Debbies and Joes want to fire and forget. If the demand for crypto exposure will rise, custodian crypto services will provide peace of mind then they will have shitton of customers. They already do.

If you need swathes of people to buy  the bags of early whales, miners and retail investors...maybe the bubble has popped and nobody will buy at such high price anymore? Ask yourself, would you buy now for 15k? No?

@_date: 2018-06-28 08:54:32


They already came in huge numbers. Why aren't they very visible? It's simple, they've been heavily investing in ICO private sales/pre sales before public offerings and dumping their bags they bought dirt cheap from insiders on retail bagholders. They risked practically nothing because by the time the coin reaches average Joes who will buy into hyped ICOs they are already gone. Why buy late some established coin if you can buy early, scoop nice profit and smoothly quit?
Well, there are some exceptions. Telegram had a massive private sale but canceled ICO. Perhaps they got spooked about SEC cracking down on various ICOs, who knows. The funny thing is the early private whales were left holding the bags they were surely wanting to dump on retail. And they can't do anything about it because they can't legally expect telegram to break the law just so they can find greater idiots to dump their bags on.

You know this is a false equivalence. You know regular people will not want to become computer geeks in order to secure their funds just to be their own banks and revel in a libertarian wet dream about personal responsibility and sovereingty. Division of labor and specialization is a thing. People will choose the path of least resistance, safety and convenience because that's what humans like to do. You must be aware of this but you shut this information down because it's inconvenient and conflicts with your beliefs. It's a fact, not an opinion.
Well guess what, nobody cares. People will continue to register on platforms like coinbase and they will hold their coins on exchanges en masse because it's convenient. It doesn't matter that it's invalidating the entire premise, customers don't care. The majority of noobs holds their funds on exchanges and are surprised and confused when told to do otherwise. A few will listen, some will maybe even go a step further and aquire more secure approach. The majority won't care.

There's more than that. There is a whole layer of awareness and aptitude regarding cybersecurity. The average Joe is terrible at this, his aptitude in this area is abysmal. It's not a big deal with traditional banking, transactions are reversible, credit cards can be replaced and funds can be returned. Lost password is not an issue.
In crypto laymen will get hacked, phished, scammed, fail to secure their wallet or transfer funds correctly or download malicious software or fake wallets, or have their 2FA compromised or be victims of social engineering and then they will have nothing. It happened many, many times and the list of possible ways to lose is insane. The attack vectors will only get more sophisticated and obscure over time.  I've seen deliberations whether printing private key on a printer that is connected to pc which is connected to the internet is safe due to some printers having memory of their prints that can be accessed later.  I've seen people who say that not having an offline pc specifically to deal with your funds is a huge mistake. The depth required to be ready against sophisticated attacks is huge.

3) Your cost of mining is on break even point or possibly exceeds the revenue but you still mine because you speculate it will rebound... yes, some do this, it's crazy.

If due to some catastrophic event people would start to believe that tether is as good as hot potato and began selling it for other assets then soon the price of other crypto like bitcoin would begin to rise dramatically in tethers. The massive tether selloff would trigger panic movements and soon it would be worthless because nobody would be buying worthless tether. Those lucky ones who began selling first would save their ass, the others would be left with worthless bags. But it doesn't end there. A lot of exchanges run on USDT. Tether is a huge provider of liquidity on the alt market, just see the coinmarketcap stats, the volume is huge. After this all bets are off. Maybe liquidity on tether exchanges would dry up causing some kind of catastrophic cascade of panic selling? Maybe only people trapped in tether ecosystem would be fucked.

But if they sell their coins to you and you deposit them on any regulated exchange and their chain analysis software says "guys, this is shady" you're fucked and your account is going to be locked and you're gonna be in for a long adventure of explaining a lot of questions. Some of these exchanges will just lock your account, won't tell you shit and have fun, gg, well played. Technically if it were ever proven that you bought these coins willingly you're fucked even more, there's criminal liability iirc. And if you unknowingly transact with these addresses or mix your coins with them or whatever that liability will stick like glue one way or another, possibly forever, be sure to never attach those addresses to any KYC info that could identify you. If FATF will ever get their suggestion of implementing travel rule you'll be nuked from orbit and blacklisted everywhere on every exchange that has an address and isn't some low profile den that could exit scam any second and it will happen simulatenously and probably last forever.

The takeaway from this story is unless you can proficiently explain 100% what they're talking about to a layman you shouldn't touch LN with a 10 meter pole. Because if you just parrot some guides and believe you can handle it without understanding what you're really doing, when something, anything goes wrong...you don't even know what to do! You don't even know whether you should do something or not! You can make things worse by trying to fix them.

Is it though? Thieves don't know if you have any weapons in your home unless you're transparent about it. Guns are useless if you're ambushed. The attacker will always have enourmous advantage because they have the initiative and they choose time and place, not you. If they're pros they will figure out your schedule and act swiftly, there won't be time to react nor an opportunity for wild west shootout. People who were robbed were usually surprised like the guy who got ambushed when entering his apartment, no time to react, wham, bam, thank you maam. Also if you're not living alone even if weapon is in arm's reach and ready to fire it's useless if they have your family at gunpoint.

Market cap is a shitty metric. It was 800 billion one time and  then it crashed to 300 in months. The institutional money came but it is not reflected in the market cap. They buy yet unlisted coins in the pre sale phase and dump them on retail investors. By the time the ICO is over and sites like coinmarketcap will list the coin they're already gone with massive profits. What happens to the coin after that is a retail investor's concern.

  &gt;  "It's the people who don't have those fancy phones that need bitcoin."
The biggest problem with giving bitcoin to poor, starving, vulnerable 3rd wolrders is they're unequipped with skills and knowledge required to use and safely store virtual assets and they don't have access to the internet and/or devices to use them and can't even afford them. There is also a language barrier, those that can't speak english will find it harder to operate software and find reliable sources of knowledge and software in their native tongues.

A good store of value is supposed to be reliable, stable, can be retrieved and exchanged for roughly the same amount of purchasing power you acquired it and be predictably useful. Bitcoin's purchasing power goes up and down randomly, sometimes in double digit percentage in the span of days or hours so it isn't stable, it isn't reliable (what you buy with your purchasing power today might not give you the same purchasing power month later) and it isn't predictable (you cannot be sure at all you will be able to get the same amount of purchasing power for your bitcoins in any arbitrary span of time). It can go up, it can go down, it's a speculative commodity not a store of value because it doesn't have any characteristics of a good store of value. Can it be used as a poor store of value in a pinch? Maybe, but it doesn't prove anything.
And no, the ability to go up a lot is not a characteristic of a good store of value, it's a characteristic of an investment vehicle with a potential or a speculative asset.

You need to go outside of your sheltered 1st worlder perspective to understand what kind of magnitude of poverty we're talking here. We're talking about people who never went to school, live in pitiful shacks, march for hours to get clean water, they toil all day just to survive and they can barely afford to save something if any. They don't even know what xbox is let alone how to operate computers, smartphones or more complicated tools.
I remember a documentary about an african family that saved for a year just to get a shitty bicycle so that the head of the family may find it easier to transport his crops for sale. Payment system? Current financial system? These people never saw or had enough money to even ponder such things. They live in low tech countries that would never replace their entire monetary system with some magical internet only money. And for what reason? Even in the scope of a hypothetical sci-fi scenario it's unrealistic. That would exclude a huge chunks of unbanked, uneducated, unequipped population from doing the most rudimentary transactions and inevitably if such a ridiculous thing occured they'd have to use some practical, tangible medium of exchange. 
Even in a dreamy sci fi scenario only the most advanced countries would go completely cashless with cryptocurrency. In the end, what's the point of changing your monetary system if that would cripple your population? It only makes sense if people in government had brain damage.

No sir. In a 100% free market you're completely free to corner the market with your absurd monopoly. 
You're completely free to disrupt and ruin your competition using any underhanded method available as long as you have the ability to apply scorched earth tactics, outspend them and ruin fair competition with cartels and short term uneconomical decisions.
You're completely free to arbitrarily discriminate your customers based on their race, religion, enthicity, affiliation, sex or whatever the hell you want if you have dominant position.
You're completely free to censor anyone you dislike or anyone who criticized you and nobody can do anything about it.
You're completely free to go full robber baron as long as you cornered some niche and massively profit from economies of scale and network effects to prohibit future competitors from becoming relevant ever. In EU Microsoft was fined by European Comission for hundreds of millions of euros for NOT promoting a range of browsers other than their own by default. In completely free market you not only don't have to mention other options, you can outright ban them and pretend they never existed in the first place.
As long as you obtain dominant position you can do whatever you want. Look no further than supposedly libertarian Peter Thiel. He says it straight to the face. 
Competition is for losers. If you want to win you need to create monopoly and hold it. This is the desired endgame for those "free market" touting businessmen. Preach for as much freedom to compete as possible until it served its purpose of elevating your empire to the top and then do everything in your power to stop everyone else from trying. It also happens today but there are more or less successful laws that try to impede such tactics.

IMF is pondering on the possible ways to strengthen negative interest rates policies by phasing out cash or diminishing its significance. In essence, when economy is shit central bank wants the interest rates to be negative - as in you dont get interest but instead pay for holding your money in the bank so that the savers are incentivised to spend or invest which might in turn boost the economy. Otherwise their savings just get hurt for doing nothing. But if you hold your money in cash you're not hurt by negative interest rates and you don't pay extra for saving. And people would prefer to not pay for the privilege of saving. With cash they can save and not pay negative interest but with cashless society deeply negative interest rates are possible because where else can you go? Nowhere.

It's possible that he's a money mule which might get him in trouble.
There is also nonzero possibility that he's unwittingly participating in a scam. Those financial scams usually mask themselves as job offers when a person is asked to perform payments/deposits on behalf of a "client" of certain company and then they fuel fraudulent/stolen funds throgh the victim who is too naive to realize they're part of fraudulent process. Sometimes they use checks that will eventually bounce, sometimes victim is sent money and is asked to buy and send bitcoin (transactions are irreversible) to someone else. Either way in the end bank realizes  that funds received by the victim were tainted, reverses all transactions, freezes accounts and goes after the mule who gets into legal trouble and massive debt. If it's even more complicated or even less transparent than what I described you should be wary.
Either way I suggest you head to r/legaladvice promptly and provide as much information as possible. That is not enough since you shouldn't be taking legal advice from strangers on the internet but people on their subreddit seen countless examples of this type of situations and they might help understanding whether your son is a victim of an old scam which has evolved into countless variants that targets young people who jump on the opportunity to quickly make decent money on the side or is a part of some kind of questionable enterprise that might blow up in his face eventually even if he's unaware of legal risks.  Either way this is sketchy and I advise you learn more about the situation and acquire professional counsel before it ends in tears.

If you're not struggling with money why you don't speculate with your own money instead of loaned one? And if you waste your money on useless shit then you need better financial discipline before you even think about investing. There are far more reliable and classical ways to save money without risking too much.
Now another critical problem is you admitted you "hope" and "believe" something will happen. You are already emotionally affected which is a bad omen. When you invest in something you should always leave the emotions at the door. You should research things, you should have a plan. You should be disciplined, cool headed and critical. I'm not saying being emotionally invested in a project is a bad thing per se but investing in project you are emotionally invested in is a recipe for disaster. It may affect your judment during critical times and you will be unable to let go, sell if the whole space goes bad or lock your gains and run away while you're still ahead. I've seen people who multiplied their gains a dozen times and still lost their ass in crypto space because they were too greedy and they were unable to stop.

There are reasons behind regulations and crime is the primary reason. The government doesn't ask for an information about transactions above 10k for the purpose on tracking down innocent civilians. They're asking for it for the purpose of tax and anti money laundering. Crypto is a good reminder why wild west banking/investing had to be tamed in the past. Because it was a horrible, chaotic hell ripe with fraud, incompetence and madness. And it will be tamed again because it gives multiple excuses to do so every day. It's like a finance history on fast forward.
Besides, the governments don't need AML regulations as an excuse to monitor people. They have better scapegoats giving them perfect excuses for monitoring citizens in much more invasive way like terrorism. So I don't see much room for abuse in AML laws.
If the mentioned lad wasn't greedy and operated like a legitimate bussinesses do, adhered to the standards of this sector and reported his earnings honestly then there wouldn't be any problem.

You're kidding right? Every time someone is buying someone else is selling. For example if I bought at 1k and sold at 15k the guy who bought at 15k funded my gains. Now for the guy who bought at 15k he needs to find someone who will pay more in order to not lose that money. It goes on and on and on until it doesn't. It's called [greater fool theory]( The indefinite growth is unsustainable. Eventually the price of an asset stops somewhere (doesn't matter where) and the last guys who bought at the last ATH have now noone else to sell their bags so they're the bagholders.
Every time someone profits from crypto someone else is losing by definition. It's not a closed system per se, you can always get more bag holders who will buy in and let the previous bag holders exit or maybe even gain something but then again those that bought last have to find someone else to save them. There is no helping each other, there is only collusion to find more suckers to buy in so that those already balls deep may exit with full pockets.

It's obviously their bussiness to notice shady movements of money. They have an obligation to report it or they will be pounded themselves for allowing potential money laundering taking place. Bank is a partner in your contract as anyone else. If they are spooked by crypto and unable to coexist with people dealing with it and decide they don't want to do bussiness with you they are free to end your relationship and they have the right to do so as much as you have.

You can make it highly undesirable to buy and use in theory.

Immutability is a bug, not a feature to normies. 
Having the power to wipe away all your money with a single mistake.
Being subjected to a risk of hacks that will take all your money and nobody will be able to help you.
Transactions that cannot be reversed even when merchant will not deliver exactly what you wanted or will simply scam you.
You need to take care of your money, deal with security and the consequences of losing your money without any insurance or deposit guarantee by the government... The list goes on and on. 
So no reversible transactions, no customer support ready to deal with your problem at a moment's notice, no ability to absorb large losses like banks have with their insurance, the chore of dealing with all the security without the resources the large institutions have and no trusted institution that will deal with chargebacks, dishonest merchants, hacks, scams etc...

Not exactly. For example when you invest in a company you invest in an entity that has assets, products, services, employees that generate revenue. You lend them capital and they generate positive value. When you speculate on crypto you simply pay for someone else to cash out. Money goes in, money goes out. Sometimes you come ahead and sell for more, sometimes you lose. There's no positive value rising from it, there's no entity behind bitcoin that you give money and assume that they will make a product or provide a service that will incur the growth and additional value, it's a speculative vehicle and you give your money or take it from other speculators.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:44:46


When that happens? Currently there are 1800 bitcoins generated per day which surely adds to the volatility considering there are liquidity issues and there isn't that much money in anyway (some estimates even say 10-15 Billion) and the miners must cash out substantial amount to pay for energy and maintenance. In 2020 it will be halved to 900 but 900 is still a lot so 2025 is the earliest date when bitcoin inflation starts dropping significantly.
Then there is vast and widespread market manipulation on many exchanges that encompasses spoofing, wash trading, tape painting, front running, insider trading, pump and dumping and god knows what else. Until that kind of manipulation is stopped and bad actors can profit from increased volatility the volatility will continue to be a problem...

You'd need to present them a vastly superior product that is safer, easier, faster more secure and strongly idiot proof (very important) to compete with already existing solutions. Solutions that offer customer service to you at a moment's notice should you shit the bed, institutions that spend millions on security and have insurance that can absorb hacks and losses. You want to fight trusted banking? Prepare to fight their biggest trump card that matters to most people, convenience.
Speed and fees matter with international wire transfers and most people don't need to use them anyway so that's one huge use case out of the way.

If they ban exchanging crypto new ones will not form. Unless they do the whole "non US customers shtick" like some did but even that does not grant 100% immunity from uncle sam. Btc-e got rekt anyway for example. Or they can heavily regulate existing exchanges like they do right now and they must comply with KYC/AML and other money transmitter laws or else they get rekt (like the korean ones recently).


Yes, overthrown by entire nations opressed and tortured to the point of rebellion. I don't see a substantial population of a single country feeling tortured and oppressed and demanding access to cryptocurrencies while they are comfy with their visas all day. Most people don't care about it.


Fight back? How and why? Even those that adopted usage of crypto are only receiving the minority of revenue from it. Some are even admitting they haven't got any customers using crypto since they adopted it and when finally someone shows up their employees can't even handle it anymore. No. The big merchants won't care, the vast majority of people pay using classical channels. Some merchants are even abandoning the whole idea due to volatility like steam.
I have a feeling you dived too deep into the rabbit hole to realize that you're high on optimism. This exchange was very funny but I hope one day you will wake up and realize the world isn't as simple as you believe and you should always ask yourself what will happen if things will not go your way.

This plan is downright suicidal. Go all in and either lose all your savings that you earned with great effort or what? Maybe earn 10-20% on bitcoin price increasing a bit? That's not a good reason to gamble all your savings. Someone in your position needs safety net in case life shits the bed and you suddenly need emergency money for...well anything that could happen and suddenly screw you. The huge gains are gone by the way unless you plan to day trade shitcoins which is completely suicidal. Even in traditional investments good traders need to lose money and learn from their mistakes before they become good. Go on, believe you will make it. This bot posts daily the fate of hundreds naive dreamers who thought like this  Observe well as their wealth vaporizes. Can you afford to lose everything in a single reckless move?
You don't have a luxury of losing money so you're essentially gambling because you're feeling desperate and in need for some huge change. You'll do whatever you feel like but in the end betting on cryptocurrencies at times is even more risky than going to the casino. Would you go to the casino right now and bet everything you have on black? I suppose the answer is no. If it's yes you need some help and support.
The number 1 rule of investing is "don't lose money". Don't speculate on volatile assets more than you can afford to lose. If you're in a terrible spot you can't afford to lose anything.
If you want to change your life you need to stop looking for easy solutions and grit your teeth, it's gonna get even worse before it gets better. Easy come easy go? Fuck the money? Bullshit. This is the delusion that people who are desperate are telling themselves to let go of their effort and convince themselves that they have nothing to lose. You have MUCH to lose.
That money is your time. Hours, days, months of hard work you put into whatever reserve funds you have right now. If you'll gamble them away recklessly you will not respect your time and you will disrespect yourself. You can potentially throw a good portion of your life away on a whim. You can do better. If your savings are meagre your situation won't improve much even from crazy gambles but will deteriorate horribly if you lose them so forget it. If your savings are substantial all the more reason to put them in safe, traditional investments and only use small percentage of them on risky instruments.
Don't listen to idiots who tell you what you want to hear. The golden rule is never, ever, EVER invest more than you can afford to lose. Right now you may be feeling you have nothing to lose but you're wrong. Be smart.

[This one]( outpaces blockchain community in the "bank the unbanked" area by light years. Interesting, isn't it? [Mobile money]( seems to be the future of payments and cryptocurrencies will have to compete with entrenched, established and widely used companies by the time they are actually ready for mass adoption by average Joes.
Do you see the difficulty? In order to beat such an established competition simply having an excellent product is not enough. You need fucking amazing product that will blow the dominant players out of the water and have the capabilities to spread like plague. Otherwise you just make hipster google+ when everyone is using facebook, snapchat and instagram and ask people to use it. It must be first and foremost easy (preferably idiotproof), convenient, fast, dependable and safe. And I don't know if general public is ready or will ever be ready for "lost private keys = fucked" feature.

Goodbye KYC/AML? You want to buy crypto from child traffickers and other kind of shady scumbags who profit from other people's misery and launder their money? I thought it was a good thing that crypto is finally getting regulated because it is more legitimate and less shady. 
Well, if decentralized, anonymous exchanges will ever become a major thing prepare for PR nightmare. The storm around Bill Gates will be nothing in comparison to the pressure from government, media and public once it is widely known that it's possible to easily evade KYC/AML laws. It's the one perfect excuse they need to hit harder and harder.

I guess that's the assumption. It could also end as a technological dead end or by the time it is ready (the development is slow after all) for regular people the mainstream institutions that can afford to spend millions on their financial systems will upgrade their solutions as well so the competition is not over even if the development will one day enter the promised land.
Personally I am pessimistic but at the very least I hope the cryptocurrency craze will force banks to upgrade and rebuild their systems to be more competitive which will be a plus no matter what happens.

I'm not sure about that.
If some country actually decided to implement the universal basic income there wouldn't be much room for any of that. 
Corrupt how? Everyone gets money unconditionally.
Bad regulations how? See above.
Cost overhead? Sending everyone a wire transfer every month....truly a costly venture, how do our countries even manage to work daily?
Prohibit....what? Doesn't make any sense.
So once again. Universal basic income is a no brainer that doesn't require some tremendous organisation effort and overhead. Obviously it is a very exotic concept that may or may not see the light of day ever but if it were actually implemented I fail to see how it could be corrupted. Alternatively it could depend on meeting some conditions but then again it's not universal anymore and is called welfare.

It seems that if you sell bitcoins as a bussiness you need to follow standard regulations or you get fucked.
However, if you decide to sell someone bitcoins or pay someone with bitcoins for something you still need to report it sometimes. In your example 5 bitcoin is 50k and single cash transactions, or a series of cash transactions above $10,000 must be reported to the IRS.
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:32:55
If you're into bitcoin at the very least you should know about its inflation. Currently miners produce 1800 bitcoins per day. In 2020 this number will be halved to 900 bitcoins per day. This means fresh 650k bitcoins produced every year for another 2 years and 330k for another 4 years.
As you may imagine this is quite a substantial amount of bitcoins introduced to the system that miners must sell in order to cover their energy and maintenance costs and turn profit. Considering a significant chunk of bitcoins is lost or never moved from their addresses for whatever reason this inflation is a bit bigger than it would ordinarily appear when compared to the total number of bitcoins.

Ban crypto exchanges and ask banks to stop dealing with them. Bam, most regular people won't touch crypto anymore, too much of a pain in the ass to circumvent this.
But wait, there's more.
They can ban ICOs in the current form, you try to sell unregistered securities without required licenses? Jail time.
Heavy crackdown on localbitcoins. You try to buy or sell bitcoin in person? Jail for unlicensed money transmission ([Already happening in US]( How do you know a guy you trade bitcoin with is not a federal agent? 
They can also heavily discourage miners from performing their operations, encourage them to gtfo, ban them or worse (see what Venezuela did to miners, yes it's a shit country but an example nonetheless).
As you can see it's entirely possible to heavily restrict and disincentivize using bitcoin without straight up banning it by using the combination (or all) of those options above. There are probably a few things I missed but whatever. The government has more tools at its disposal than you might realize.

How do you convince average Joe to switch from his Visa to a cryptocurrency (bitcoin or anything else) that requires:
Additional setup to get in from fiat;
Technical knowledge to not fuck anything up;
Ability to safely wield it and store it and be in charge of your own security;
Vigilance to avoid scams that are popping out here and there and to spot early signs of failing exchanges that might go under and take your money with them;
Tolerance to hande long transaction times and fees;
And finally courage to use a tool that offers no chargebacks.

Billionaires on paper. The moment any bitcoin billionaire moves their stash the whole thing collapses.

If everyone had all the answers there would be no need for discussion. 
I am increasingly becoming more and more disillusioned with crypto space and its future potential due to greed, manipulation, criminal behavior and irrationality ruining the entire ecosystem and people along with it, this may affect my judgment a bit and made me cynical. 
However there is so much of unsubstantiated positive propaganda out there that is selling some really unrealistic vision and promises (especially to ignorant, misinformed noobs) I doubt my cynism could even dent it even if I tried. 
Once the whole thing comes crashing down (and let's not pretend it won't, it's a next dotcom type bubble and 99% of those coins will definitely not stand the test of time, the only question is when and how much will everyone pay for reality check) let's hope we won't be only left with pets.com but some amazons too.

Except in this case Bill has a shitton of fiat money (and probably wealth in other instruments but whatever). Can I buy a giant mansion with bitcoin? I don't think so. If you're a billionaire in an asset with poor liquidity that is barely usable then you're not really a billionaire because the moment you want to buy something expensive you need to cash out and in case of this market if some big boy tries to cash out their millions the entire space runs out to the door and panic sells.


How the hell do you enjoy your wealth if most of the time you cannot buy shit with it? At the moment Bitcoin is currency that is barely adopted so it's not very useful. It has a lot of speculative value. 


Ok I'm convinced you're either trolling or you're completely delusional. There will be no new world without filthy fiat. The governments have so much power they could practically kill bitcoin if they wanted. Not that they want to, but if they really felt it's a danger to them they could like this:
They can ban icos (like china).
They can ban exchanges which shuts down access for the majority of the population and leaves localbitcoins, the outrage of crypto nerds will be barely noticeable, normies won't care and they won't bother with the inconvenience.
They can also ban trading on localbitcoins and organize sting operations and jail traders who operate as MSB without licenses (it already happens in the US for example).
They can compel merchants to not accept payment in cryptocurrencies, another door closed for wider adoption.
Or they can impose regulations for merchants, exchanges, traders etc. that will make dealing with crypto such a pain in the ass that most people won't bother.
But I don't think they will do all that, because it's not as dangerous to the bankers and governments as you think it is.
Besides, I don't know if you noticed but the new world if it even came to fruition will be dominated by another kind of scumbags. The guys who already do stuff like pump and dumping, wash trading, spoofing, tape painting, insider trading, front running and manipulating the market left and right while the small time investors get hosed, rekt and liquidated every day.

It's the bureaucracy. It's insane in France. Here's the short version of the experience of my colleague when he was exchange student about 6 years ago:
He needed a bank account. Here's how it works for us in Poland:
1. You go to bank
2. You provide your personal data, show your id and you get yourself an account.
How it looked for him in France:
1. You need a French phone number.
* Bonus challenge, get a phone number without a bank account. Nope, you can't. What about burner phones/prepaid phones? Nope you need to register your sim by providing (yes you guessed it) your bank account number.
He got around it by using his landlord landline...
2. You need to get an appointment (fucking what m8?), can't just walk straight from the street inside.
3. A bit of more bureaucracy but I can't remember all of it since we had this conversation years ago.
Still fucking dumb.

Exchanges don't care as long as they collect fees. No matter whether you buy 10k USD worth of bitcoin today or 2 years ago they profit regardless of price. But they profit more if  there are more transactions and more active trading. This is why exchange owners hype it up because they want people to buy and trade. Currently there is a downtrend of people coming into cryptocurrency and exchanges see less volume. It's not the end of the world but it's a bear market. 
This is why bitmex or binance ceos and many others hype it up that the bear market is gonna end soon even though it may not for months or years like the last time, it's a possibility that can't be disregarded.

Hmm, if you put it that way then it kinda sucks to buy anything long term like house on mortage. Just imagine, your debt would be automatically increasing over time because you'd be naturally earning less and less due to deflation. The price is the same but the wage will get lower accordingly to adopt to deflating money supply. And while car debt seems less scary house debt seems like a recipe for a crippling slavery. Unlike inflation which devalues debt and helps those that pay off loans this would be an opposite effect, hmm.

Of course there are limits. I am aware of that. Banks are not indestructible. Insurance is not infinite. Everything can fall. But putting your money in bank carries much less risk than putting your money into crypto because in case of hack/fuckup/bug/anything you're losing 100% of it with no recourse. There are no perfect solutions. I live in Europe so I don't know much about US banks but we have guarantee funds as well. 
Anyway the headline was India wants to eliminate use of cryptocurrencies. You said:


If they only eliminate cryptocurrencies then sure, other blockchain solutions may exist. But the title is not bogus because the article mentioned cryptocurrencies as part of payment system and things that are not used for paying are not currencies.

I understand what you're trying to say but this is a false equivalency. Internet was something new, a true gamechanger that offered lots of possibilities. What does bitcoin add to the already existing solutions? look at this from the perspective of ordinary people who are not into this kind of stuff. Why would they replace already working banking system for something (atm) worse? It's not as safe, not as fast, not as convenient, not as easy and not as idiot proof. If it's supposed to go big it must be at least as good as current systems and offer **a lot more.**
What does bitcoin offer to offset those disadvantages? Blockchain technology and decentralized network? Maybe nerds are excited about it. Low fees? Currently I hear they aren't low. Anonymity? Hardly anyone truly needs that. Security? Layman will be much more at risk with bitcoin.
The only advantage I see is faster and cheaper international money transfers but again, not many people need that so not a very big advantage.
So I'd rather believe in AI going big in our lifetimes than bitcoin. But go ahead, use some arguments to prove me wrong. I'm lurking those bitcoin forums from time to time to finally witness the moment but alas, so far hardly any progress. So far it's been exciting as an investment vehicle but as a currency...it just sucks.

No it's not. And it's especially not trivial for an average layman. 
1. You need technical knowledge to not fuck anything up at any point.
2. You need to know how to avoid obvious and less obvious scams and be enough into bitcoin to know which exchanges are less reputable or risky, or even prone to collapsing.
3. You need to know about computer security as well. Ad blockers and script blockers are advised. Some use more advanced tools too.
4. Which wallet to use.
5. What about cold storage? (usb? paper wallet? hardware? each of them has flaws)
Looking at this list (probably missed a few points) and knowing that massive chunk of population doesn't even know what uBlock is...yeah, not very trivial?

Isn't holding your coins in centralised exchange the very antithesis of "be your own bank" that bitcoin represents? I think it is indeed. Sadly I imagine that there is no excape for theoretical, future mainstream cryptos. 
Traditionally people who are into things like cryptos have different priorities and likes than most of the regular people. Things like decentralised system, public ledger, anonymous transactions, powerful tools that gives more power to the user seem attractive to them but the sad thing is regular average joes don't need it and don't like it. The sad thing is average joes gravitate towards higher order of organisation and...less complicated options? Web browsers development that seem to be dumbing down everything for years into simplified, easy looks and everything complicated hidden under the hood is one example of that. 
I personally hate that but I am power user, I love having all shit at my disposal instead of everything hidden and I find it annyoing that I need to click every goddamn time on this 3 bar button to access anything in modern browsers but I realize it's not geared towards people like me. Bitcoin and its spinoffs may suffer such "domestication" in order for having any chance of mainstream adoption. I just wonder what would bitcoin people say if the only answer to going truly mainstream all over the world would be "domestication".

Inter-planetary species in the coming decades? Just because it is technically possible for us to send someone on Mars doesn't mean we will colonize it anytime soon. And by colonize I don't mean 5 astronauts cramped in a capsule house with basic necessities and utilities and no long term self-sufficiency. I'm talking serious colonies that can survive on their own, replace their own population and grow. And this is not really gonna happen on a serious scale without a livable atmosphere and temperature high enough to support liquid water. The problem is, Mars doesn't have a working dynamo in its core which means no magnetosphere which protects the planets' atmosphere from solar wind so it won't be blown into space over time and living organisms as well.
Don't worry about interplanetary financial systems, worry about that goddamn magnetosphere not working. And before you think about some Jules Verne/Armageddon 'nuke the core' mission type, just remember that the deepest we ever drilled is about 12 kilometers :/

You're counting on people counciously buying en masse into a scheme that assumes some kind of unlawful vigilante-esque approach under the pretense of "insurance" even though it is nothing like insurance at all and it's more akin to hiring mercenaries to "take care" of some issue or someone. And instead of just doing it straight it operates under the pretense of eventuality, funny. There's no tiptoing around the issue. Let's drop the act and nice words like "insurance" and "prediction markets" and call things how they are. You are exploring the possibility for the decentralized mercenary market for specific goals. In this case we assume this particular prediction market will sort of order hit jobs for the greater good. The methods of achieving those goals would be completely at a discretion of parties that would eventually profit from the scheme should the prediction happen to be true.
In a climate that would allow such a thing I'm sure much less noble schemes would also sprout but that is beyond the scope of this exploration. I'm simply implying that to consider that society as whole would even think about using such a thing is ridiculous. Bitcoin may succeed or it may fail but such scheme is unrealistic imho and it borders some kind of morbid  dark sci-fi scenario.
I consider such a scenario to be remotely plausible only in a world in which state is gone. Otherwise your hired vigilantes who supposedly will outnumber the security forces of a targered factory will be gunned down by swat like common thugs after police is called. So let me ask you. Do you on top of this thing believe in the disappearance of state? Because that would make at least some sense, otherwise it's just wishful thinking powered by some very creative fantasy.
The solution for global pollution isn't some anonymous sabotage groups powered by the blockchain. That's what anarchist and naive activist groups resort to and that's why they are an irrelevant speck of history that will never amount to anything other than temporary nuisance for the companies they targeted.
The change is all about slow progress towards consensus about dangers to the environment on the higher echelons of power, pressure from society, good science and sound reasoning and real activism and time... It already begins. Big companies understand it is "hip" to be eco and are switching their data centers to renewable energy sources by themselves. They know it's good PR. Big polluting countries like China begin to understand that polluting their own citizens is overall uneconomical in the long run due to health issues and invest heavily in renewable energy. European Union strives heavily towards cleaner energy and I bet United States will in time also become more eco friendly, they have good conditions for those. Unfortunately we will always pollute the environment one way or another because our whole civilization relies on high tech solutions but this damage can be diminished with progress and better, eco friendly industrial solutions not some weird high-tech luddite vigilantism. That's short sighted and hardly effective in the grand scheme of things. A childish fantasy that could work in a comic book, not a real world.

Uh, actually if we took your example literally and applied it today with the assumption that only a small niche of people would be interested in bitcoin then bitcoin inflation would be substantial due to the cost of mining and mining reward. Without substantial demand the price can't be sustained because currently miners produce 1800 bitcoins per day and will continue to do so for another 2 years so when they sell and there isn't much demand the price will tend to drop due to monetary inflation.


Yeah. On that we can agree. And how do you envision the masses of people who don't care about their fiat being subjected to yearly 2% inflation to start caring about it? Fiat is convenient and people don't hold most of their assets in fiat anyway. That slow devaluation doesn't hurt much unless you're storing all your money in mattresses and not invest it in anything.

Why? It's a mutual relationship and both you and a bank have a say how they want this relationship to work. Both parties can end this relationship if they are dissatisfied, it is fair by definition. If you don't like their terms go somewhere else. If they don't like the way you're using their services they also can dissolve your relationship. 
If you say a bank ending the contract with you should be illegal 
you're essentially forcing them to accept that you will use their services in any way you want including the ones they may not be comfortable with. Imagine yourself in their shoes. Imagine you have a contract with a bank and suddenly they change their mind about the terms and start charging ridiculous fees on your checking account and there's nothing you can do to end your contract because you already chose your bank and your are stuck with it forever until you die. Ridiculous, right? This isn't free market at all.

This is an interesting question. If such issue ever were presented in court I wonder what the judge would do. Let's say that person A says it was offered a bitcoin on some website and paid for it and got bcash instead. Is that a fraud?
First you'd have to have an absolute definition of bitcoin. BCH crew disagrees with the current paradigm and claims their coin is closer to the true bitcoin vision. BTC crew says their arguments are horseshit. And portion of community agrees and another disagrees.
So what would judge do if there is no real brand protection in this space, there are regular forks everywhere and depending on personal definition and individually chosen specific criteria bcash can be real bitcoin or btc can be real bitcoin in many people's eyes. For people ideologically rooted in one or another this is unacceptable that both could be it but the judge doesn't care about personal opinions, biases, preferences and ideological differences, he has a to make a ruling based on something tangible.
So in my opinion judge will tacke this issue from another angle. Because he sees both groups shouting "no u!" he abandons that route and instead asks how the transaction looked like exactly.
Example 1: person A paid person B 9k for 1 btc. Got 1 bch instead. You cannot argue that person B acted in good faith here even if they're ideologically inclined to claim or believe that bitcoin cash is real bitcoin. Person A clearly paid a price very close to the current volatile rate of exchange of the btc coin but got bch coin instead. Clear fraud.
Example 2: person A paid person B 1.4k for 1 bitcoin. Person A says they were cheated and they wanted "real" bitcoin. Person B says in their opinion bitcoin cash is real bitcoin because (litany of reasons). This is where the whole thing gets muddy. Is the person A aware that btc goes for 9k and they were possibly buying something else? Did person B tried to trick person A into buying bch instead of btc or simply honestly acted in good faith because they truly believe that bch is the real bitcoin? Did person A specifically requested btc coin or just "bitcoin" in general? Is person A just trying to be cute and bully person B to give them 1 btc for a huge discount using the court? In my opinion the judge will try to gauge the motives of both parties and whether someone was trying to trick the other person. What if the person selling bcash bought it from someone else claiming it was bitcoin and was sure they own bitcoin and was selling it in good faith? The list of possible angles goes on and on but I don't think in this case it will be declared a fraud at all. A fraud is a wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. If you paid 1.4k and got a coin that is worth 1.4k then there is no real financial gain here tbf. Judge will probably just think it was a mistake or bad communication because cryptospace is batshit crazy and rife with ideological differences.


I'd love to see that and the ensuing meltdown of Roger Ver as he argues in court that bitcoin cash is real bitcoin and some other party argues that btc is real bitcoin and the resulting drama. It would be extremely entertaining even if nothing much came of it.

First of all, I'm not an American so I don't have knowledge about AG ways of handling things. Still, they sent these letters to major crypto exchanges presumably in good faith in order to obtain information that would assist them in their task for greater transparency and investor protection. I see nothing wrong with that. If you read the questionnaire you'll see they are reasonable questions and there is nothing wrong with a bit more transparency and honesty.
Some of those exchanges officially deny US citizens from their services because they don't want to be subjected to US jurisdiction. Which is even more hilarious because why would Kraken CEO rage that hard about a letter from an organisation that is more like an honest inquiry and not some cease and desist ultimatum?
In fact, they could literally not respond and it would be much better for their PR than this....rant? Instead guys like Bittrex and Gemini showed examples of confidence and leadership and Kraken showed a manchild who refuses to adapt. I find it extremely hilarious.
Also about international organisation...I'm not sure such thing even exists, each country has their own laws and their own bodies responsible for handling companies that deal with their citizens.

I understand your point of view but let's be clear here, there's no such thing as an existing definition of the real bitcoin.
To crazy Roger and his fans his fork with bigger blocks with bigger capacity is a real bitcoin, closer to a white paper vision a peer to peer cash.
To many people here bitcoin btc is a real bitcoin, with smaller blocks potentially less susceptible to centralization. Fundamentally they're both correct because there is no absolute definition, it's all about perspective and what in your opinion is the direction the network should develop. Now of course more people believe in BTC than in BCH but what if today someone made a fork and the network would split 50/50? Which one would be the real bitcoin? Who gets to decide that and why? What if the split would go in 3 distinctive ways because of some community split or development arguments and all of the new networks would get approximately 1/3 of the market share? Would Chain A, B or C be a real bitcoin and why? Or maybe the previous BCH? 
That would depend entirely on the people who chose one network over the other. This is why unlike people who are very attached to their favorite crypto brand in my opinion this is fine. Why? People who put their trust in BCH may truly believe that saving people from putting money in fake bitcoin (btc) is a good thing to do because BCH is better and more useful. Meanwhile BTC fans will believe that protecting people from fake bitcoin (bch) pretending to be "real" bitcoin is the right thing to do because BTC is better. I know that many people will argue here that the scummy moves and misleading practices of Roger are bad and he is on the wrong side of history but once again, pretend for a minute that you believe that BCH vision is much better, in such case fighting the "core" with anything you've got would be the right thing to do.
People who are emotionally or financially invested in one of those will often defend their beliefs to the death and deny the other group their position. I on the other hand believe there is no fundamental absolute truth which chain is the truest one and both groups have the right to claim they are correct and the degree of their success should be determined by the consensus of people not some powerful organisation that will impede them one way or another just because some people complained about them. By asking some authority to intervene they are taking the ability of the people to decide and that is not decentralization. 
Like that twitter shutdown. People were cheering that the Twitter has shut down bitcoin account (which is presumably controlled by BCH people) and this was wrong in my opinion. When a centralized entity takes power from your opponent it may be convenient but it is a hypocrisy to cheer because when the same thing would happen to you you'd be crying about your ruined decentralization dreams.

Sure using black market currencies like USD to buy things works in times of hardcore economic crises when national currencies are devalued into shit. Personally if I were to choose between dolar and bitcoin I'd choose USD in place like Venezuela because more people would be ready to trade their goods for USD than for bitcoin.
In regular countries that aren't on the brink of economical collapse however if a government were to ban them...well people just wouldn't use them. No real incentive to break the law for businesses and average people.

All I see is wishful thinking and barely any arguments.


When niche currency like bitcoin was effectively banned in some countries like China only a handful of individuals continued to buy them and they had to pay a premium on top of regular price. I don't see how decreasing the availability and usefulness of bitcoin would entice everyone to actually use it instead of more convenient options. If anything, banning exchanges and stinging local bitcoins will decrease the demand because it's a pain in the ass and there is risk.


That's what you believe but the masses aren't convinced. And the demand is out there but nowhere near the entire world, more like some small parts of every society that include tech enthusiasts, libertarians, criminals, people who disagree with monetary policy and...well, a lot of fomoed speculators who wanted to get rich quick. It's a niche and everyone has different opinion about what it should be, what it is and how it should work. Medium of exchange? Electronic cash? Store of value? Investment? Digital gold? 
People can't even fully agree that this thing should be a currency and not something to be hoarded or speculated on.

Just look at the chart carefully. Right before the enormous pump there was a quick flash crash (dump?) that cleaned longs a bit before the price started spiking into space which liquidated shitton of shorts and forced a short squeeze that launched the price into a single, high candle. If some whales, shitty exchanges and insider traders wanted to obliterate shorts might as well create a bait in form of dump and lure more traders into shorting before they moved and killed them all. This was beautiful. Doesn't matter whether you short or long, you can't win against these guys.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:32:43
There is a possibility that the whole 160k btc + bcash stash will be liquidated in order to lock in the value of the stash in JPY for tax collection purposes. Taxes on payments to shareholders will probably  have to be calculated in a stable currency. Of course what remains will go to the shareholders and even then I suppose Mark will want these funds to be redistributed to mt Gox customers because I bet he doesn't want to be swamped by thousands of lawsuits but then again this isn't the most desirable outcome for them anyway.

If you want permissionless environment, you can't be mad people do what they want without anyone's permission. Person A may say that person B is appropriating "their" crypto brand due to various reasons but person B may say they are the ones who should have that brand and provide their reasons. And you can't force either to comply because they don't need permission to do so and there is no central authority to declare which is wrong or right.

@_date: 2018-04-11 11:06:03
On the contrary. Sure, it sucks but then again if bank is afraid of crypto they can dissolve their relationship with you because there is no law that compels them to take it. A contract with bank is a mutual relationship and both parties can end this relationship if they are dissatisfied. There is nothing out of ordinary here. Feeling entitled to being offered a service of a particular bank... that is exactly what free market is not. Don't like it? Go elsewhere with your bitcoin bussiness.

Exactly. The community **as a whole**. But if you go to some authority and ask them to blacklist or punish bcash websites one way or another or take them down and they do so (like the twitter thing for a while) then you've simply taken the ability of the whole community to decide and handed it over to central authority instead.

Let's pretend we're both major shareholders of Kraken for a moment (and I have no clue if Kraken is publicly traded, I'd wager not, doesn't matter). The first thing I'd be asking myself is "why the fuck this baby speaks in our name?". What is your first thought? I get it, you and others like that he had the "balls" to speak his mind but that's not how high level professionals handle themselves.
This is what is shocking me. In other businesses displays of amateurship bring ridicule and scorn but in crypto, where there are less safeguards and more risks instead of more scrutiny and scepticism we see more leniency from people for some reason. This is what I can't understand. 
Just, look at Bittrex response for example in comparison:


It's not a secret that many companies in crypto are ran by amateur dudebros. At the end of the day guys like Gemini or Coinbase will stand the test of time and they will get a seat at the table during serious talks like they did before. Meanwhile amateurs will rant and not achieve anything serious.

Whether what your competition claims is right is up to everyone to decide and whining about it or even reporting it to some central authority like google is exactly what decentralization is not about. Moreover if you reported it and succeeded you'd further impede the permisionless environment and thus prove that you weren't really interested in it in the first place. You were interested in brand and whether it was a good brand or shitty brand is irrelevant because you took the ability to decide from the network and handed it to some powerful entity instead. People somehow don't realize the borders are more fluid than they seem and engage in brand wars trench warfare.

"Stop paying them or participating in systems that they profit from."
You don't realize that the vast majority of society doesn't take seriously this kind of anarchist wishful thinking? Not only they wouldn't take it seriously, they wouldn't even ponder this kind of thing. This is why anarchists are such a joke. Nobody believes in their funny revolution other than themselves.
"If only nobody obeyed we wouldn't have to put up with government and their laws" is a reasoning of a disconnected political outsiders that will never amount to anything. Well, it sometimes works when entire society becomes disobedient but it only works in horribly ran tyrannical regimes that torment and opress their own people and people are unhappy about the quality of living. But in such poorly ran, fallen states people have bigger concerns than something as trivial as bitcoin ban. In normal states that function properly? Not. A. Chance.

You can do these things you know. Not that everyone is interested in them. What does it have to do with a service already used by billions of people?
Let me put it this way. Let's take Wolf of Wall Street "sell me this pen" type of scene and remake it into "sell me this social media platform" except you have to sell it to the average Joes who already are on facebook along with their friends and family. Not some neckbeard tech enthusiasts who migrate to other platforms because they see some interesting features, regular people who are rooted like plants.
How do you convince enough of them to switch to another platform with a sales pitch about monetizing their data when they clearly don't care about it since they use free services that already do everything they want? You said it yourself in previous post, most people don't realize the implications of using things that collect their personal data in the first place.
Google tried to beat facebook and failed horribly. Just offering better/more insteresting features is not enough. The network effect of Facebook is tremendous. And you want to beat it with a sales pitch about collecting your personal data ( nobody cares) and some shitty tokens? Sorry, that's not how you will win over the normies. Now if everyone care about their personal data as much as more aware, tech savvy consumers, then maybe it would be a different story.

That's decentralization.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:41:05
I see. I respect your position. At least you attempted to discuss this seriously unlike some salty people in this thread who only attacked me for my point of view.


I believe long term this is simply inevitable. Companies like Gemini are super forward, honest and cooperative towards authorities because they want to stand the test of time. They aren't run by dudebros who want to fight the system, they aren't the kind of guys who want to flip the table, they want a seat at the table and they will get it. I think we should respect more those compliant and established exchanges that don't jump the ship like rats the moment it gets difficult and instead adapt and attempt to negotiate the future regulations.
In the end I believe only those exchanges that will subject themselves to public scrutiny and become transparent and professional will survive and those skittish exchanges that are afraid of regulators and have to jump from one country to another to avoid laws and are very unstable, unprofessional and unable to adapt to rising industry standards and upgrade themselves are not thinking in the long term at all.

The worst thing? You lose the money that could be put into other kinds of investments. Not only you lose that money, you also lose hypothetical gains you'd get from those investments. Like I said. This ain't an investor mindset. Also investing with borrowed money, holy shit that's like the opposite of good practice. So in worst case scenario you also pay interest on borrowed money that you lost, wow.
You know what a person with actual investing mindset would do if they believed it was worth putting some money into this thing just in case? Instead of buying bitcoin on credit like a stereotypical impatient, millenial brat he would either work harder or just patiently saved a bit over time from his steady income (per your example) and then afforded himself some exposure (how much depends on his comfort zone) to risky vehicles like bitcoin. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:39:40
Your argument has a lot of merit, that I cannot argue against. However the BCH community disagrees with it and they believed that expanding the capacity (at the cost of increasing the blocks) was the best development route and thefore they made a necessary turn that was more in line with the projected bitcoin future while the btc is too stagnant and goes nowhere in their eyes. I mean it's not worth 0 bucks so a lot of people would disagree with your reasoning and even though it is sound their decision is valid as well (from their perspective).


Almost. I'm simply not denying the BCH community the ability to claim that their vision is better representation of bitcoin (as most people in this sub do but some agreed with me) even though personally I'm not convinced and often their tactics are horseshit. I am not bcash fan in any shape or form. But I'm not gonna deny them agency and the ability to claim they are the real, better vision of bitcoin because they don't need my permission, that was the crux of my posts. Their claim is not very strong but I would not deny them the ability to fight the good fight just like I would not deny some absolute shitcoin fork to do the same because the community as a whole will decide too. Still, thanks for good read.
Also I have a question. Let's say that some time in the future bitcoin forked again and both chains would be compatible with previous versions. Which one is the real bitcoin in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:49:51


Yes. Exactly. There is a tug of war between governments that want to combat climate change, those that don't and companies that want to profit from it both financially and reputation wise and those which business models are endangered by the shift in energy policy and are opposed to it. 


Quite opposite, really. See my entire point from previous post. Either you are stuck with complex derivative that makes sense but has to lock the money in for a very long time and possibly pay high premiums (and I'm not sure if anyone would be really interested in it) or you are stuck with a short term speculative vehicle that is anything but insurance and more like gambling. Might as well bet what temperature will be tommorow morning at 8 am. Whoa, such innovation. There's not much room for a middle ground sadly. If the projected period of time is too short then current factors will not have time to really have a substantial impact and therefore that only leaves us with speculative gambling. Or even worse. If the past factors have been studied well and their impact is documented and proven and there is a visible trend then if we made the same bet in 2048 about 2050 we're practically in a realm of certainty and again in the range of crazy no fucking way premiums for an event that basically must happen. The climate doesn't change overnight. It's a tricky issue.
So that leaves only the long term option but once again we are cockblocked by the current events and facts and one more thing that I will mention in the moment. A theoretical insurer today would look at various estimations and decide that currently countries are dicking around too much with the agreements and implementation of them and the stalemate will continue for a while because international agreements are a slow rolling train that stops very often. And then they'd decide that it's not worth it. The person who would like to be insured in case of continued or at least unchanged fuckery would likely have to be eaten alive by premiums because why would anyone make willingly such an assymetric bet?
Now why is that such a pain in the ass and random events like breaking legs or crashing car aren't? Well that's because climate is not random and is global, not local. And in the event that the people who actually bought "climate change insurance" who pay crazy premiums actually were right the house would have to pay off every single policyholder out there. Ouch. The house wins because people don't decide to break legs at the same time. So once again no normal insurer would think about implementing such madness. Then again you are speculating about the emergence of long term decentralized prediction markets.


See this is the problem. So many premises so little room for things not going your way. Like a Batman Gambit but you're not batman. Since the long term climate bet is highly assymetric due to predictable future results steming from current data and behavior of lawmakers then there has to be an incentive for someone to take that uneven bet. Even on decentralized markets some kind of premium will have to be given, no way around it or no one will take that bet. Another problem is that you can't just willy nilly enter such a serious long term derivative and leave after a few years. That would be a terrible waste of money. Once again short term bets are nothing but a speculation about a tiny fluctuations but then again for such a bets roulette works just fine so that is a no no. So that leaves me with a grim realization that if such a thing was ever conceived only the very high net worth individuals maybe would try to attempt it and would have enough capital and balls to follow through. Forget average Joe. I'm talking housing market credit default swap balls deep type of guys possibly with scientific backgrounds or counsel.


Or by investing in stocks of companies (who will deal with space exploration). And by governments. Like it used to be with original exploration for a long time.
Anyway thank your for acknowledging my criticism. It isn't perfect but someone has to, reddit is a very curated system that is quite hostile to opposing views so there are places where it's hard to talk in depth in disagreement when there is vested interest. 


Haha, hardly, I'd like to think I at least attempt to see things how they are. Bitcoiners are chronic optimists who shut down criticism and scrutiny. I on the other hand try to be as grounded as possible. Which leaves me with bonus opinion I'd like to share. It relates to said space exploration and it isn't pretty. In my opinion the Fermi Paradox and the Great Filter lie in one inconvenient thought that hardly anyone wants to explore. That space exploration is so hard it might be a pipe dream. Even if we were to achieve the speed of light which is completely outside the realm of possibility for our current civilization (and not quite possible thanks to certain physical limitations) the area we could reliably conquer with such an amazing technology would be laughably pitiful. The distance and time taken to travel between the stars are the greatest enemies of living sentient beings in the universe wanting to explore and colonize. I mean even reaching our large neighbour, the Andromeda Galaxy would take 2.5 millions of years for the future speed of light super spaceship. In such time our entire civilization could end and said ship would probably malfunctioned and died long time before reaching any substantial landmark and we're only talking about our local group. Reaching points of real interest in our own galaxy would still take thousands, dozens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years and that's with breathtaking technology that is beyond our comprehension. 
That leaves us with something even far greater to dream about space exploration, a star trek technology. Even if it were possible on paper what if the cost of such an undertaking would require far more resources than an entire solar system? Bam, the end. Trapped like everyone else. 
TL:DR the universe could be too boring to allow the warp drive. Also quantum teleportation isn't a teleportation and does not allow instantenous transfer of information. Every sensationalist article on the web lies or is terribly confused but sensational anyway for the sake of clicks. Welcome to the boring limitations of science.
This is a morbid future worth exploring imo but I guess daydreaming about how we need to escape our rock before we destroy it is way too easy than accepting reality that this may be our only rock ever. And I haven't even touched the problem of radiation that is a huuuge cockblocker even for future Mars explorers. They may exit their rocket as a permanently damaged, useless invalids, look into the guy who was on the ISS for a very long time. This post has become too long and I'm too lazy to proofread it now, hopefully it stays coherent. Cheers.

Good investors know that the most important thing isn't to get rich quick, and taking ridiculous "high risk, high reward" approaches. The rich are rich because they don't lose money and they don't lose their head when it comes to their investments. They specifically look out for things and factors that could fuck them up, they ask questions and dig deep looking for any kind of information, especially information about stuff that could undermine their investment. A good, rich investors don't ask first "how much would I gain from this?" but instead ask themselves "What could go wrong? What if I'm wrong? What else I don't know?" etc. etc. and do everything they can to not lose money first and foremost.
In this regard many crypto speculators fail because they are often afraid of the "FUD" and shun away critique or scepticism towards their favorite projects. Regular investors don't do that because they know it is stupid and dangerous to be emotionally invested in something. When you start investing you leave emotions at the door. You must be cold and you must be ruthless. Fools who literally marry their coins are subjecting themselves to the risk of emotional rollercoasters and are shooting themselves in the foot right from the beggining. They may be unable to dump when the time to dump comes because they're emotionally attached, it's like a ball and chain. Hell, many of them don't even recognize the fact that they're not investing, they're speculating. Currencies aren't investments but they still can be speculated on.
"Take the risk and if it you lose, oh well" isn't an investment approach. I don't care how long term or short term is the scope of this bet on the bitcoin future. Investing is about mindset. "go big or go home" is not an investor mindset. It's a get rich quick yolo gambler mindset and the gutter is full of these fools. And don't get me wrong, there are speculators in this space who know the drill and don't suck whales' dicks whenever they decide to wipe out naive idiots but then again those guys have experience and average "crypto investor" is an unsophisticated amateur who starts in the most ravenous, unrestricted and unstable market there is.

Hahaha, I like your cynism. However I wasn't using Facebook as an example how PR keeps corporations in line (even though it often does and to a hilarious extent), it was an example of how young generation tries to radically transform the old organizations they enter with their ideas (and often fails but hey, one day they will be the old people).


Have you seen the predictions for the next century? Betting against pollution is practically akin to giving free money to people who would bet on pollution. Now around and after 2100 well I wouldn't be so sure in the long term but right now even the optimistic calculations are meh. And the pessimistic look horrible. 
My point is if you tried to get a traditional insurer to enter a contract with you in which you're insuring yourself against a polluted environment that supposedly may negatively impact your life and that contract said "If the global temperature rise will not drop under certain treshold by year X you will pay me Y amount of money" they'd laugh. And if you somehow convinced them to actually create this kind of insurance their algorithms (using current data) would skullfuck you with premiums of epic proportions because as I said currently betting against pollution is completely irrational and not supported by evidence whatsoever. I will repeat again. Expecting that someone will create a derivative in which they will pay you if we continue to fuck up environment is laughably naive because we will continue to fuck up environment for a long time. It's a given. It's like betting that the grass will be green in 10 years. It will be green, I will take your money, thank you.
According to Nature current country pledges are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise "well below 2 °C. All major industrialized nations are failing to meet the pledges they made in the Paris Agreement. (Haha) In addition to failing to meet their reduction pledge amounts, the countries are not even enacting all the policies that they planned to do in order to meet their pledged reduction of CO2 output. Pathetic. 
In addition, an MIT News article written on April 22, 2016 discussed recent MIT studies on the true impact that the Paris Agreement had on global temperature increase. Using their Integrated Global System Modeling (IGSM) to predict temperature increase results in 2100, they used a wide range of scenarios that included no effort towards climate change past 2030, and full extension of the Paris Agreement past 2030. They concluded that the Paris Agreement would cause temperature decrease by about 0.6 to 1.1 degrees Celsius, with only a 0.1 C change in 2050 for all scenarios. They concluded that, although beneficial, there was strong evidence that the goal provided by the Paris Agreement could not be met in the future under the current circumstances. Source wiki btw. Also I'm sad now.
Sure, maybe if multiple countries move their lazy asses and actually not only agree on yet another useless climate accord but also enforce the agreement somehow that will be a gamechanger. Of course that's difficult to accomplish because countries don't want enforcement. And this is where the whole premise falls apart due to lack of consensus.


Not. The. Same. Thing. It's completely another realm of events. If my car is damaged it is damaged, not much nuance here. Climate is a slow and delicate machine that takes years to change. Unless your weird pollution derivatives require to invest and freeze the money for decades (because that's how long it would take for any positive change to be really noticeable on the grand scale) or are dependant on small fluctuations in which case it's pure gambling. Like the CO2 PPM fluctuates every month. It drops by a few points, it goes up by a few points. Global temperature is also moving very slowly. Not much of an insurance in this case, the world is not saved or doomed, just another, useless speculative derivative, lol. Even if we doubled our efforts today it would take decades to change. 


Yes. 10 steps forward, 9 steps backward. Slow progress with birth pains every step of the way. That's humanity way. Not gonna change anytime soon so might as well get over it. 
Ok I admit I haven't checked out the links to your papers. Unfortunately I don't have time to read 81 pages paper about peer to peer oracle systems so I guess I can't really complain here. I wish you luck with your coin. It is clearly very ambitious project.

That assumes everyone will care, especially enough to employ such a thing and pay for it. Also I fail to see how the original premise "Bitcoin will eventually enable us to insure against pollution" is even applicable in such fashion without some catastrophic event that wipes out states and laws and leads into some kind of decentralized vigilante justice dystopian system. It's just unrealistic daydreaming to be honest.


Somehow I'm not convinced private wars is a solution. That's your response? Someone who hires security will have less firepower than the people who want to overpower him in order to stop him? So we pit both groups of armed people against each other in order to resolve a situation and settle disputes, with their blood? If it ever came to that it would be a good example that shows we learned nothing as a society, a trip straight back middle ages.

With the current block size the network can handle 7 transactions per second tops. To transfer money to LN wallet or close the channel you have to make a transaction on the blockchain.

Okay I like that we are back in the realm of reality again. Sounds much more reasonable. However this still would never work for multiple reasons. For insurance to work there have to be parties betting on different outcomes and still be simultaneously happy about it. Insurance is all about calculating risk. For insurer it is sensible to assume most people will not break legs or have their houses catch on fire. For a single individual it may be benefitial to bet that something may happen to them and they want to be insured against that unlikely but possibly very impactful scenario.
However this logic does not apply to pollution. Why? Let's say I want to "mitigate risk" of pollution (dafuq) and bet against it. If the pollution goes up I get paid. If it goes down I pay someone else who made a bet against that outcome.
Who in their right mind would bet against the pollution? If anything I'd bet for pollution because as a civilization we are still developing and more pollution is a given. Developing world has yet to catch up. If today entire Africa demanded the same standard of living as US we'd have to burn energy like crazy and mine and process incredible amount of additional resources. The age of globally declining polution will not happen in our lifetime. Nobody rational would invest anything in pollution insurance. That would be the literal definition of "asking for it". And for the sake of argument I'm even charitably leaving the whole entire 'vigilantes will find a way' fantasy out of it. And there's more.
Technical difficulties. How do we measure pollution? Let's say we go the most lazy way, Co2 PPM. It is subjected to fluctuations. Do we use some kind of averages?  No matter, what's more important is how do you enforce the whole scheme to work as agreed on the blockchain? Some kind of smart contract that pulls the numbers from a research website that presents current environmental data? What if somebody hacks this website and make it display incorrent information just before the smart contract will inquire for a new batch of data and distribute the money accordingly? This is yet another level of headache and the problems keep piling up.
Honestly this is a dead end. Also greenwashing aside, I was mostly refering to an actual efforts. The big companies are truly moving on to renewables and while I'm not sure why they're so hardcore about it... maybe it's just a generational change? This is rarely talked about but sillicon valley companies are sometimes purging their older employees and want to hire a fresh ones.  Maybe they're afraid they will go out of style like blockbuster if they keep their staff getting older, I have no idea. But there are some symptoms like the Facebook employees who wanted to crucify their management for not banning unsavory, vile politicians whom they hate and sometimes felt alienated for being ignored after voicing their perhaps a bit radical beliefs. But these kind of people eventually will replace the older generation and will become the new norm for better and worse. There is a talk about massive culture shift in the west and obviously this should affect the businesses as well.

It's neither good nor bad. This is what permissionless environment is. It means brands are not protected and any jackass can fork your coin and claim he is following the original vision and the others aren't and if enough jackasses follow him then the network decides that this "brand" has value. 
There is no such thing as real bitcoin. The people decide individually. In case of bcash it has less value than bitcoin (core) but it is much more than zero so some people are fine with that vision which means to them bitcoin cash isn't a worthless knockoff but simply another version (in their eyes, more close to the idea of white paper and therefore more valid).
Don't get me wrong, Roger Ver is batshit crazy but if he believes bitcoin cash is real bitcoin and it is worth more than 0 and some people agree then they are technically not wrong. People who say btc is real bitcoin are also not wrong. This is what permissionlessness is. Anyone can claim whatever they want, in the end the market decides and this decision can be decisive (like the other previous bitocoin scammy forks that nobody cares about which gone nowhere) or indecisive like the BCH vs BTC case.
Being angry about it is pointless because this is to be **expected** in such environment.

The only thing that matters is the relation of reward vs the cost of mining. The mining power will be added or substracted and the power costs will rise or fall to slowly reach the equilibrium with price (block reward). Doesn't matter if someone invents a 5 dollar smartwatch that can mine faster than Antminer s9. Miners will just deploy millions of smartwatches until it doesn't make sense economically. POW is not efficient or inefficient in itself, it's anti efficient by design. If you create more efficient device all you're changing is the hashing power and difficulty, the energy spent will remain the same.

Face it, open source will never have nearly as much penetration as commercial patented options because the likes of Apple or Windows design with the intention to appeal to retail customer and SELL. 
If you didn't see that clip you should, it's very important, please watch it.
Steve Jobs basically admits that designing excellent software is a nice goal but much better goal is to design something that is good enough and sells. Open source stuff like Linux doesn't have the commercial machine to promote their stuff enough and drive to cut and mutilate and mutate their creations ruthlessly to suit the customer preferences. 
In fact he emphasises that you gotta start from customer experience and work backwards to the technology. And it is a bitter pill to swallow. It seems backwards to many tech people. The technogeek attitude that they know better what people need is a flaw that may turn even technically superior software into a product that has terrible reach because it's not what people will want or choose even if you're sure they want the wrong thing or you're providing better solution on paper.
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see a new ecosystem seriously competing with android or iOS but they achieved so much reach and dominance because they wanted to sell first and tech was a mean to an end not a goal so I don't see open source competing with that. One wants to be better and the other one wants to sell and acts accordingly to achieve that goal. They win because they spend money to know what people want and they know how to convince people to want/use their stuff.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:11:56


You should.


Welcome to the economies of scale. A bunch of enthusiasts with their miners can't possibly compare with enormous industrial grade operations that have professional setup and energy rates so cheap that average Joes can't possibly compete unless they're not concerned with mining at a huge loss.


Yeah I get it, but alas as the technology gets more sophisticated over time it's becoming more expensive to add meaningful hashing power to the network. I mean nothing stops bitcoin fans from becoming casual miners with their PCs but even if many decided to do it they wouldn't make a dent in the overall professional miner monopoly, they would just waste energy because their devices aren't powerful enough.


You got it backwards. Energy efficiency is not a factor. It doesn't matter. The energy expenditure is growing to match the block reward no matter whether you use a cpu or a dyson sphere with matrioshka brain. 
If somebody invents a new chip that has efficiency 1000 times beter than current miners when it comes to energy consumption and for some unexplicable reason it's very cheap to produce too (unlikely) and decides to put it everywhere (TV, watches, fucking wall clocks) then it still doesn't change the fact that miners will add more and more devices to the network until the collective power consumption from those new more efficient devices is reaching the block reward and economies of scale will decide that normal people can't compete with giants who deploy much more devices than the public, buy their miners in bulk and have everything cheaper. They will have their grip on the network again unless incredible amount of people simultaneously  decide to altruistically mine at loss but it's naive to expect that, pow just incentivises cutthroat competition.
Do you get it now? In the long run more efficient miners only change the total hashing power, the energy consumption stays the same because when a new devices comes that makes the previous ones obsolete people add more new devices to the network in a rapid rat race to compete for block rewards with those who deployed them first and have rewards nearly for free (their miners make the other devices effectively obsolete so they pay not a whole lot of energy for t heir reward) and so everyone is back to square one once the energy consumption from new better devices reaches the same levels again but there is simply more hashing power around.

Well guess what, hackers don't care. No matter how many security layers you'll add to the unhackable protocol at some point it's just redundant circlejerking (with overkill hash power). 
Any given system is as secure as its weakest link. In case of crypto the weakest link is you, a person and that link has been exploited numerous times and will be exploited again and again because humans are imperfect and can be outsmarted. Bitcoin is unhackable with brute force but it can be stolen in numerous ways. It is also a software so it subjected to bugs and exploits like any software. For example this one

Well, I guess the usual practice of preinstalling software on computers that retail customers buy also tremendously helps with recognition and market share but that helps Microsoft, Apple is a beast in its own right and people choose their brand on their own regardless. 
Inferior or not, commercial software wins because it sells. And it sells because people who make it spend a whole lot of money and effort to make that happen. Meanwhile a bunch of open source geeks creates software they might consider superior but hardly anybody looks at it because they don't create it with the explicit intention to be as approachable as possible at any cost and sell it and they don't market it as well as those that do. Sure, there is also a privilege of being a giant in an entrenched position but they got to those positions strictly because they designed their products to appeal to the massess and they made significant efforts to be at the front of customers attention. 
[Actually read this article about the historical context how small market share of open source OS and bundling windows in new computers lead to the snowball effect of tremendous market share.](
It paints a clear picture with quotes like:
"Serdar Yegulalp of Computerworld said that in the late 1990s, because Linux was not fully developed, Linux computers were "a tough sell for non-technical users".[6]"
"Analyst Vishal Tripathi said that many consumers purchase PCs with pre-installed operating systems because they do not want to deal with the "learning curve" and inconvenience of installing an operating system."
Also the shady market practices and 'windows tax' contributed to the result. Also human nature, humans prefer convenience and choose path of least resistance so software makers who provide easier, more idiotproof solutions at the cost of their sophistication, flexibility or even utility. I mean look in which way the modern browser design is going. You want to access any options you need to click on a button that expands the list of options and before you get the more advanced ones you need to dig deeper and deeper. It is designed to work well without any additional input and menus and options that used to be visible on the main screen of user interface are now two or more clicks away and those advanced options that used to be a click or two away are now hidden or behind additional menus. It's pissing me off tbf, I prefer the less sanitized browsers.
