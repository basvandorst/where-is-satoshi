Hello, kind of new to Bitcoin. Been reading for a few months and possibly starting to buy small amounts every month and HODL.
Anyway.. I had very little amount on mycelium before the fork. On August 2 I transferred all into a new wallet, and wanted to use the seed of the old wallet in electron cash to play with bcash and possibly convert it to Bitcoin or also hodl and see how it goes. BUT... when importing the seed into electron cash it shows the transfer I made on Aug 2 on the Bitcoin wallet in mycelium and wallet is empty of BCC/Bch or whatever is called.
What's the error I made??

If only I had invested some of the time I spent in this game into buying real bitcoin...

I understood the reference perfectly.

I grabbed one last year on black Friday and can say they are. I'm no audiophile but for over ear Bluetooth I think are one of the best. Maybe bose beat their NC but not the audio quality imo.
Edit: Looking at the pic those look like on ear and not over ear. So not exactly the same.

You can choose economy fee. I just tried and went from 3.x to 0.25 usd of fee. There's a little pencil when you set the amount to send and you can choose between regular and economy there.

Tal cual. No creo que convenga usar este tipo de servicios para alguien con experiencia. Solo lo quería destacar como un paso para una adopción más general y apuntada a otro público.
Si no me equivoco con el cambio vendías Bitcoin a 5050 y comprabas a 5800.

Hay que escanear DNI y alguna cosa mas. No la use realmente. Si se hace zoom en la foto a la derecha están las instrucciones. No se ve muy bien pero creo que algo se entienden.

Then I'm lost. How can I enter the wallet and have 0 funds and 0 transactions? I don't get it...

I looked at the balance and funds are there.
Also... If someone somehow had access to my wallet..  Bread should show the outgoing TX.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:26:32
That's good so I must be in the right wallet... So this seems like a problem in bread then... Should I try to enter the 12 words on a different wallet then?

Afaik bread does not support segwit. 
I tried the mnemonic in electrum as well and still shows 0 balance and 0 transactions. Im kinda lost (and worried). Not sure what else to try.

Update: Good news! Imanaged to recover my funds!
However, there's some weird stuff on my endeavor.
First: 
I used  to sort out which word was wrong. Indeed it was an ambiguous meaning of one of the words + changing another one with some similar meaning (altough not literally the same) what led me to a different wallet... which kind of blows my mind.
I was positive that i had found the correct mnemonic now... so i went to Bread.. entered the 12 words... and it says INVALID somehow... 
I then tried in Electrum... and it worked, but shows no funds/transactions... nothing.
Then.. i remembered reading here  that Breadwallet app was using BIP32 AND MultiBit HD for the derivation path and client. So after changing that on  , i finally saw a familiar address shown. SUCCESS!
All was left was to google how to import MultiBit HD Bit 32 addresses into electrum, and the result showed me that i needed to copy all the private keys for all the public addresses that had funds in it. I still need to sort out about entering the "change" addresses for when i sent some btc,  as it seems its not as straightforward as the receive addresses but i think i have the info to achieve that as  well.
I guess bread changed the way it works with the mnemonic lately and that's why it says is invalid? that part i do not understand... I will be reporting it to their support team.
The good side about this is i learned a lot about how this works, and that i need to write down the seed  exactly and not rely on my mind to translate something.
I will be moving all my funds to a new Segwit wallet created in Electrum to be sure nothing is compromised, and to have segwit finally.
Thanks to everyone that helped me here.

How about segwit? Fees are pretty high in xapo right  now even for low priority.
