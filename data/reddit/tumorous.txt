Oh, surely we can come up with a shadier sounding URL than that.
...no, I guess not.

Very appreciated! Ironically, I spent a good bit of time after posting this (and before your tip) figuring out how it would be best for me to buy a little BTC.
Here's hoping that it all works out for you and me in the long run.

Of course there is the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. Many fine economists are Sveriges-Riksbank winners.

Settle down, wait a few minutes, and look for the transaction and confirmations on blockchain.info.

How do you feel about $59?

Yeah, 1 BTC is pretty steep. If they started at .01 or .05, they might actually get somewhere...

Lots of ranting, lots of exclamation points.
Although it screams many things, "sound financial analysis" is not one of them.

Yeah, people should be banned from discussing bitcoins.

Yeah, it's a user-specific site-wide preference. Nothing to do with the subreddit.

The premise is that Reddit would select users for the CNN opportunity based on bitcoin donation... not that CNN is asking Reddit users to give them money (that would make *even less* sense).

I understand the idea of using Bitcoin for micropayments in games. I'm missing the part where you become a billionaire, solve the world's social inequalities, and -- generally -- how this is different from all the other gaming companies that have figured out how to suck money out of gamer pockets with micropayments...

If you have a problem with it, you can check the "make safe(r) for work" option in your reddit preferences, and it will hide NSFW thumbnails.

It's worth considering that it's quite rational for individuals to use Mt. Gox and not its alternatives for trading.
Since Mt. Gox **is** the market, we all bear the short-term risk of an Mt. Gox collapse crashing the overall BTC/USD exchange. Whether you make use of Mt. Gox or not, if it goes out next week it will affect the exchange rate dramatically. By using an alternative service, you add the universal Mt. Gox risk to that associated with your own choice.
(Of course, this is not the case for people in it for the long term or uninterested in the exchange rate... but most of those people aren't regularly using these trading sites anyway.)
