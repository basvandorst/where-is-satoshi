another idea, some sort of computing machine which has super expensive hardware costs but negligible electricity (remove chinese electricity advantage). also hopefully it wont be manufactured by only 1 company so that worldwide individuals can buy at similar cost. 
maybe some type of software not able to be sybil attacked, that requires the most expensive SSD and RAM on the market for each machine as well as other hardware which will be expensive to everyone worldwide. so not much electricity usage but high costs.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:44:18
so monero mining should slowly become unprofitable since hackers will infect machines and mine for 0 cost.

The only thing that comes to mind to filter out Chinese miners even if they spoof their IP addresses, would be to force a certain download and upload speed tests/files to filter and kick off non-domestic miners from the network (say you are in the USA and want only american miners ). maybe make them pay a fee to get tested which they lose if they are too slow. also make it unviable to upload to an american pc then reupload to the network,  by adding a hard time stamp or something that changes too quickly.
edit: like make one bitcoin project per country. an american one, british one, japanese one etc, each country will have ip bans and maybe work with governments to prevent foreign VPN's. miners can put down deposits that they will lose if they mine from overseas? then users decide which country they think will respect their privacy and let them do what they like. I suspect china will have 0 users.

they dont have USD deposits or withdrawals so the only way to get money out is by buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:10:08
they need to pay for the electricity by dumping the mined coins each day. if they mine 1800 BTC per day at a price of $1, then amount of new FIAT needed will be $1800, if the price is $2600 then they need $4,680,000 per day just to pay for their costs.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:21:18
at least it has a shot at being backed by something, if you think about it bitcoin is the same but backed by nothing.
imagine a bitcoin token that was fully decentralized that had a high probability of being backed by gold (eg. audited company, no kyc etc). pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:08:37
except you can sell or trade mass amounts of gold without dumping the price. ie. it is an accepted, trusted and stable currency. try dump thousands of bitcoins and watch all the other speculators panic.

somehow using country IP address ranges that are not able to be lent/rented to other countries and have a max hashrate per country quota, of which all miners in the country receive a percentage. 
the issue is that to kick off cheaters, some central authority would need to be involved.
alternatively, some sort of POS where you allow quotas per person per country, although distributing it to real local citizens will be gamed by 3rd parties who will pay people to go in and sell their quota.
However, if mining were to be done at only losses, it would only be motivated individuals who would participate. lets say mining tokens were rewarded based on your countries electricity rate, and even then you received, say 90% of your cost, you would mine at a loss, but less loss than if it was a standard chinese rate.

just be aware of the risks of getting caught. you can lie, but be aware of what will happen if they call your bluff.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:05:13
after a network split the hashrate will need to adjust, which could take weeks. So basically you will be spending lots of money but not getting any blocks for all your hard work.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:45:12

if the issue is block propagation, then we should set up 1 crypto per country, rather than outsource mining to china. orphan all chinese blocks. eg make blocks 1gb each. 2 hours after china uploads 1 block there will be 10 new ones already.

never good to hear about DDOS attacks on miners. If they cant be dealt with effectively , they can become a very real threat to bitcoin, since the entire system relies on the internet.
They might not be able to hack bitcoin, but if all miners/full-nodes are down for a few weeks due to state DDOSing, the project will kinda be dead.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:41:45
POS system where a non-profit uses their mining gains to constantly promote decentralize mining, with guides and help for noobs to set up their own. 
make it not roi, sort of like full nodes, let them just generate slowly just their initial hardware. this way transaction fees will suffice for small transaction amounts.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:15:33
so if they dump millions of coins there wont be enough fiat to pay for mining hashrate? is that the plan? bankrupt the miners on the other chain?
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:51:10
due to limited amounts of coins, there will probably be centralization with PoS. 
thing about computers is that there are unlimited amounts of miners, so getting 51% should be impossible. except at the moment 80%+ hashpower is from china. so ye its fucked. Bitcoin is basically paypal 2.0. Mike Hearn was right.

digital tokens of money that are backed by real currency, that can be transferred instantly to other people for all to see.
They use internal processing that can only be sent to limited people, and that may take a few days to clear.

Heres an idea, contact various charities in many countries, and get them to agree to ID (say government ID, name + ID number) certain "donation" products (no multi ID or re-use their id to get a few, also say cash only , so they have to actually be local.) that they will sell to locals each month, 1 per person, these codes will be used to allow mining. There will be a max hashrate per country too but unlimited donation codes, so the rewards will be divided between locals, no matter if theres 1 or 1 million, just the more miners in one country, the less for everyone in that country . 
There might be a market to sell the codes, but it would be better if it would be worthwhile for each buyer to mine for more than they could sell. 
If the charity plays games, they will get hard forked off and a new charity will take their spot. Sort of a cross between POW and POS.
