Means he's going to get to spend more time working on the things he really enjoys, such as "new cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin", and he's "[...] very excited about all the new and interesting technology that is coming to production--Bulletproofs / CT, signature aggregation, improved propagation and synchronization--as well as the continuing maturation of Bitcoin as a viable subject matter for academic researchers."

Would be interesting to know what "capital efficient" means in this context. Miners have a selfish economic incentive to continually mine, and if the price is too low the hashrate declines as per design as the capital assets are repurposed. 
Curious whether similar economic incentives are built into LN. Routing nodes will at some point stop serving if their return in capital is lower than, say, a bank checking account.

This subreddit is one of the few (on reddit) where I go for "all things bitcoin". Anywhere else you'd suggest this should be posted? I'll gladly subscribe to the new subreddit.

Earlier in this thread said:


Until bitcoin mainchain is capable of deploying this, CA/CT sounds like it will be restricted to sidechains for the foreseeable near-future. Thus, Monero, DASH or Zcash are probably fine.

That wouldn't be his fault per se, but his entire supporting team of writers and producers.

Unfortunately, probably the only way to combat this is to personally drop a note to Coindesk that you were misquoted so it's on record. I doubt they will listen to somebody that isn't the (misquoted) source trying to correct the record.
Interestingly, if your "objections" are actually corrected, then this story loses the tension, which in turn makes the article less balanced from an editorial perspective. Sometimes though, a great incremental innovation should be simply celebrated as such.

Thanks for a miner's perspective about the economics. This helps others understand better the numbers that miners are evaluating in their decision making that is quite different from users or developers.

Setting aside the the option of having funds disbursed via BTC, are there any other advantages of having Kraken process the claim instead of the Gox trustees directly?

That's the part where I'd like additional details. The creditor claim and payout support live chat &amp; email is compelling.

Re communication: The court in Japan seems to have no problem translating documents to English to-date once they realized that a large proportion of the MtGox customers were English-speaking. 
Re technical and operational capability: At some point we all, including Kraken, must depend on the trustee to release the funds. I'm not sure how Kraken's capabilities would be of additional benefit here (hence my question).

Hopefully the underbanked and unbanked in America who use alternative financial services such as check cashers will see some of these fees come down even further in a few years due to blockchain settlement systems. 
For such a "simple" use-case, Bitcoin seems to be well positioned. Would be pretty interesting if all paychecks could be cryptographically signed and "searchable" on a public blockchain, visible only to authorized participants. Check cashing would be an inherently less risky business, which would hopefully pass cost savings down to the end consumer in a more transparent manner.

Was any Blockstream representative invited to the meeting?

Do you recommend that full nodes (even small ones) run Luke-Jr's Core+BIP148 branch? Or just stick with Core-vanilla until this entire thing blows over?
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:09:47
You're right. Too bad Federal capital gains cannot be ignored. The IRS has long arms.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:19:30
That's correct, until or unless more miners defect from mining BAHF and mine the BIP148 chain to speed up the block confirmations again.
