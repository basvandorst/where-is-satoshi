See my other post. I didn't notice this was from April at first. However, it's still valid and thought it might save people going through the same rigmarole I did.

Yep, looks like I'll have to wait for Coinbase to offer UK payments...though it is apparently in the pipeline :)

So, on the basis that TransferWise is out of the question for me. Anyone know of another SEPA transfer/FX company who I can use from the UK to BitStamp?

Sorry should have mentioned that. Fair point! It is still valid though, I didn't find out about this despite looking on Reddit and doing a general Google. Thought it might save people signing up and filling in all the details like I did, only to find at the point of submitting the form...linking me to this notice.

This is definitely a great idea for those people who want to save in Bitcoin, without the temptation to cash out easily and let their investment ride a little! :)

Thanks for this! I was sure I had looked before and it seemed very expensive...but from looking just now, it seems pretty reasonable!

It's getting a little frustrating, it's definitely a barrier to the utility of Bitcoin! I'll find a way! :D

Thanks for this, sadly not that simple with my bank :(

I am intrigued about the shares you're talking about though now! lol
