Depending on your location, it's usually immensely easier to buy weed with fiat money. Almost all trade in illegal contraband is cash based (or proxies of such).
There is however so-called darknet markets that cater to most substance related cravings, and there are subreddits where knowledgeable people congregate.
Darknet markets are however a minuscule part of substance commerce, but do have advantages to people unwilling or unable to seek out cash-based transactions. 
I hear that quality is generally higher, risk of violence is almost zero, and in many cases safer from LE. 
You should know that Bitcoin isn't anonymous per se. The closest practical thing to a anonymous currency is good old used cash. Bitcoin is referred to as being _pseudonymous_, meaning all transactions are logged and visible by everyone - but your identity isn't _necessarily_  connected to those transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:57:59
I agree. Unfortunately, they seem very insistant on 'owning' the name Bitcoin itself - otherwise they would have just forked off long ago. This struggle is for me a very real test of decentralized org versus centralized org, and I'm quite happy to see how strong a decentralized org can be (so far).

Well, if I author a proposal to improve Bitcoin, the community may accept it or reject it. If they accept it - my proposal is now a part of what you may call Bitcoin.
If they reject it on the other hand, it just seems distasteful to proclaim that Bitcoin without my proposal is not _true_ Bitcoin. This is a common tactic in business and politics, but a very destructive tactic in a decentralized consensus driven organisation.
Although I judge Unlimited to have poor technical reasoning behind their implementations, I would like to see them fail exclusively due to the tactics employed. Meaning that, even _if_ I agreed with their implementation, I would not support them due to their choice of organisational structure and marketing tactics employed.
If a centralized organisation with fiduciary duty towards specific investors ends up controlling Bitcoin, then all the communal work on the project up until now will have been for naught, in my opinion.

That's true - although it is not sourced by any of the parties involved, but by a Bloomberg analyst. What I would normally call a 'weak' source. 
But on the other hand, I saw that my EDGAR-foo is in great decline. The filing I linked to earlier had nothing to do with the Winklevoss filing, and therefore utterly irrelevant for this discussion. I apologize, and thank you for taking time to find a source.

Is it really to "shatter Bitcoin in two Altcoins" when a few guys form a company and decide to do something different with the chain and split off, while the hundreds of thousands of other users just continue as always? Seems a bit hyperbolic.

Dude, that guy is not important for the ETF approval process. They hired spdrwoman (Kathleen Moriarty), who was at the table for the first ETF to ever be approved, and was given a lifetime achievement award by ETF.com. She is considered by many to be the TOP lawyer in the ETF field.
David Brill worked for Gemini for 8 months i 2016 as general counsel.

~~Mainstream adoption involves interfacing with fiat. I have much love for decentralized exchanges and apps in general, but in this case I was specifically addressing exchanges in the context of mainstream adoption.~~

1. Wanting mainstream adoption of Bitcoin .
2. Wanting major exchanges to disregard the laws of the countries they operate in. 
You can only choose one. 
I'm neither a fan of KYC/AML law implementations, nor Law enforcement agencies in general. But it's naive to expect mainstream companies to act as revolutionaries. If you want to stay underground - stay off the mainstream exchanges. This can reduce your exposure to government interference, but also certainly increase your exposure to other fraudulent behavior from the exchange. 
Do you want to store funds in an exchange that has more to lose if they start scamming customers, or store funds in an exchange that disregards government law and enforcement. Choose one.

Maybe also spend some time reading the actual lines, instead of just in between them..
The story is about two discredited businessmen trying to amass a huge trove of bitcoin related patents. I don't see anything that lends credence to his claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto. 
And Reuters as an organisation is a bit different than the rest of MSM.

I made a silly little [website]( 
in December '16. Price was around 750 USD at the time, and thought it would be a fun little easteregg to have the following code on the page:
    if (usdBtcFloat &lt;= 9000) {
          answEl.innerHTML = 'YES';
          answEl.classList.add('live');
      } else {
          answEl.innerHTML = 'NOT ENOUGH DATA';
          answEl.classList.add('live');
      }
