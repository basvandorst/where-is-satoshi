I bought at 19k, I think that's more than enough reason to worry.

People have been saying this every year, I wonder who's really filled with regrets...

If you guys would have X amount of money and you would be starting to invest this late (unfortunately) in the game, what ratio would be used to buy BTC/ETH?

the whole point is to not sell when it drops, its to buy more.

lucky you, I bought at 19.5k, right before this shit storm. I'm gonna HODL, even though it makes me really sad :c

People are buying other cryptos because they have all been growing exponentially in the past 6 months and all seem to be good investments. Also not putting all your eggs in 1 basket is always a good rule.

I bought some for the first time at 19k, so this doesn't make me feel any better. My first taste of crypto is investing in BTC, ETC and LTC during their all time peeks and then watching them slowly crash now. 
I gonna HODL but it really sucks to think that had I bought 1 day later I'd have been buying in a dip.

Not with the amount of fees youll be paying, its unlikely to be a viable option unless you are insanely good at predicting (which is pretty much impossible right now.)

I diversified, all the other coins are dropping like rocks too.
