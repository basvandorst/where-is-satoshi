staking rewards just for _having_ lightning tokens? this is the first time i've heard of that -- can you link to more info?

@_date: 2018-01-27 16:38:19
two of several more wallets that offer multiple cryptos
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:28:44
you mean like jaxx or exodus?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:46:59
to be fair, the fees _did_ get that high. they're fixed for now but it seems silly to say that there's no problem just because its temporarily a nonissue.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:22:01
right, so do it up. you said it was easy
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:12:54


dude go ahead and do it already then take that bcash shit out
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:26:16
quick put up more nodes to secure the network!
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:34:11
except that again, that's hardly relevant to what we're talking about here. are you so upset that we possibly may not share the same views that you can't even look past that? lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:31:50
dunno, but thats hardly relevant
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:55:15
solid point my man
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:57:32
only that the market value differs.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:57:54
so you think segwit is on par with the whitepaper's specifications?
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:24:18
I often wonder if I'm right about Bitcoin (Cash) and Bitcoin Legacy.
Then Bitcoin Legacy supporters show me that they're unable to back up their support, instead simply reducing themselves to insults, and I realize I'm right after all.

I mean, it's speak_ing_, but I don't think it's fair to compare a mere ~3 months to 9 years
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:56:59
lol you don't really think that's an accurate way of proving yourself right, do you? i sell my bitcoin legacy for much more bitcoin cash than that
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:28:41


but litecoin is just a shitty clone of core
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:52:22
so youre just going to keep claiming bitcoin.org is the official site despite the site itself claiming otherwise?
and then just insult or ignore anyone that brings up this point?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:39:57
and the owner of bitcoin.org says that the whitepaper should be removed and forgotten
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:24:14
check the top of the second page
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:31:18
i notice you ignore everyone that points out that bitcoin.org literally says its not the official website
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:27:56
why one private site but not the other?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:19:11
for now, but i think it's important to keep in mind that BTC has had ~3000% longer time to gain adoption
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:53:59
believe me, i did.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:06:09
to be fair i think he calls it unfair because it's cheaper than using legacy transactions which imo is a fair statement. segwit is priced differently.
