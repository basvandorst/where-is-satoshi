Me too.  In a few days/weeks we'll be seeing posts about people bemoaning about how they sold or wished they had bought when it was below $10k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:08
Because you never know when the absolute bottom of the bottom is.  Don't try and perfectly hit the bottom of the dip.  You'll never, ever hit it.  If you believe Bitcoin will *ever* get back to 19k again, then now is an absolute amazing time to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:32:18
I did.  I still have well over 95% of my original holding.  But I did sell late last year and covered my cost basis and then some.

Still couldn't understand.  Just sounded distorted to me.  Sure its better, but still totally useless.

Temporary situation here.  Learn some goddamn patience.  Segwit should be more widely adopted this year once Bitcoin core wallet implements it which should be in the next couple months.  That alone will significantly help as its the de facto official reference wallet for the Bitcoin client.  LN has the potential to drastically reduce fees for day to day uses.  I am committing to opening a LN node myself and will be putting up around .5BTC in as many channels as makes sense.  Schnorr signatures are also coming which will help those wallets with lots of input addresses.
This takes time.  Bitcoin is a victim of its own success right now.  I know its frustrating at the moment, but it will pass.  Trying to download movies over a 28.8 baud modem wasn't practical either in 1993.  But those who knew what was going on didn't give up on this whole "internet thing".  
So advice?  Pay a low fee, accept it might take several days to get your Bitcoin, or just hold it and hunker down for a few months.  Use an exchange that doesn't charge fees (Gdax).  This.  Is. Temporary.

This is pretty much all you gotta do to get bitcoin going on a raspberry pi. Other than getting the external usb drive going -- format in exfat or ext3 if you have a main linux pc
git clone -b v0.15.1  bitcoin-v0.15.1

Red herring argument.  Radios are not used as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  Bad analogy.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:55:28
1)  All of this is planned in 2018.  Segwit *is* released already, just need it to be more adopted
2) LN is technically already working on main net as well
3) Schnorr signatures are on the 2018 roadmap
4) Market share doesn't mean much.  Some guy can create an alt coin, pre-mine a couple billion coins, then sell *one* for 50 cents and *boom*.  Billion dollar market cap.  Only bitcoin has the mass adoption and used *by far* the most  number of people, most number of merchants, most used in mainstream economy.  Bitcoin has the strongest and secure network by both hash power and number of decentralized nodes.  Market share is a pretty poor way to gauge crypto currencies.

How does Bitcoin undermine anything?  Why can't the government accept Bitcoin directly as payment?  I have no problem paying taxes.  I'll be paying tens of thousands this year in capital gains and I gladly do it.  What I don't like is the government controlling the medium of exchange to begin with. The monetary system should be neutral and not under the control of any central authority.  It allows billions of people around the world today that are shut off from banking to participate in an economy.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to open a bank account.  Thousands more have their accounts frozen.  Free flow of communication and commerce is what we should support.  Government interference in that sector is an affront to human rights.  That is why I support Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:29
Yes it does.  It absolutely, completely, without any exception whatsoever necessitates a chain split.  That's what a hard fork means.  It goes in two directions.  Chain split / hard fork are synonymous.
Best case scenario is 100% adoption of all miners and nodes on exactly the same block number.  Even then, its still a chain split and nothing prevents another miner / node from continuing the old chain from where it split. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:00:19
Temporarily. Once Segwit is widely adopted, LN goes live and schnorr signatures implemented, we're back in business.  This is a new technology still.  Flattening at ~15k when it was what, 2k this time a year ago?  I'll take that no problem.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:26:19


Its backed by nothing more than the faith in the govenment.  Whatever that means.  Fiat money (paper money) loses value every year.  Thats what inflation is.  Bitcoin is backed by the cryptographic secure global wide network that is not susceptible to government collapses, hacks (equifax), or hyperinflation (venezuela, brazil, greece, etc.).
I think the ultimate value is not based against USD but against itself.  It has more value as a store of value and medium of exchange than the US dollar.  Not today, though.  Bitcoin today is where the internet was in 1993.  The internet today is far more useful and valuable than it was in 1993.  So yeah, I think long-term Bitcoin is very much undervalued.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:18:58
Public ledger.  Its a public bulletin board that everyone agrees is the official record.  All transactions are written on that public bulletin board in the middle of town and when a transaction occurs, the town crier lets everyone know who paid who so there is never any disagreement.  Its completely public and can't be changed (its written in stone lets say). 
I start there as the analogy and then once that part clicks, work into the more accurate description.  Trying to jump into "blockchains", "hashes", "cryptography", etc. just makes peoples eyes glaze over and you lost them.   Let them "get it" first, even if it isn't totally accurate, then work from there.
You're welcome.

Segwit enabled wallet here.  Its the exchanges.  They are the ones with enormous volume causing non-segwit transactions.  Coinbase is dragging their feet.  If Coinbase had segwit (and batched transactions), we'd be seeing single digit fees again (if not less).
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:14


Which is based on how useful it is for a store of value, ease of use, speed of transactions, cost of transaction, censorship resistance, and security.  All of those things are dependent on the underlying technology.

Lambo's depreciate, but more importantly they *deteriorate*.  Bitcoin is immutable.  It does not degrade like a Lambo will slowly and inexorably rust and corrode.  The value we put on Bitcoin may change, but the digital asset itself cannot change.  The analogy you used with a lambo does not apply.

Miners do not control everything.  Nodes accept blocks from the miners.  If miners decided to do something the nodes don't accept, you essentially just made a fork.  Nodes are an essential part of the Network and why I run one myself..

I'm in this decades as well pal, which is why I'm not sweating corrections like this.  Did I say I'm expecting it to jettison back in a week?  Don't strawman me.  I sold a bit late last year around October when it was around 11K and covered my cost basis and then some, realizing a ~5000% gain.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:45:45
Yeah, as in "we'll see".  I don't expect it to dip much further (but it might), in response to the commenter of don't try and catch a falling knife.  I never said its going back to the moon later today or tomorrow.  If it goes down a bit more in the next few days, *shrug*.  
This is absolutely going to last years.  We'll see 50% drops again from highs over and over again like we have seen for years.  I'll keep buying at dips, maybe sell a bit if I see a huge increase super fast and I think we're due for a correction, or maybe I keep holding or maybe I sold too early and it shoots up even more.  Whatever.  I'm not panicking, and long-term I don't see Bitcoin *not* succeeding. 
I'm done going back and forth with you.  have a nice day.

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:36:34
according to Paul Sztorc.  He's redefining words.
A hard fork is 100% the same exact thing as a chain split.  There is absolutely no difference whatsoever.  Moving to a larger block is incompatible with current Bitcoin rules.  You can either continue "left" with 1MB blocks or you can go "right" with larger blocks.  Until that split/fork happens they are the same path.  I disagree with his definition that a "hard fork" is a mandatory upgrade.  Such a thing does not exist in crypto-currency.  You can either agree to the new rules or not.  If you don't, you continue on your merry way with no affect (directly at least).  Mandatory upgrades do not apply, its a non sequitur. 
Back to the topic at hand.  Moving to a larger blocksize of Bitcoin would mean you have two chains.  A Cryptocurrency that had 1MB blocks in the blockchain and continued to have 1MB blocks at block X and continuing at X+Y, and a cryptocurrency that has 1MB blocks through block X and then starting at X+1 with &gt;1MB blocks.  At X is the fork in the road and once you choose which way to go (voluntarily up to you, but you must make a choice), you now have two paths.
I know this will be the case because I run a full node and will not agree to a larger block.  I will turn on my old Bitcoin miner and continue to mine the 1MB blockchain.  This *will* result in a hard fork/chain split.

We shouldn't have fee-less transactions.  Fees prevent spammers from initiating infinite dummy transactions.  Fees incentivize miners to actually confirm transactions otherwise they are spending money on electricity for no gain which is unsustainable.  
Fees are good.  The current high-fees of Bitcoin are not so good.  A happy balance needs to be found.

I was here since 2013 pal.  Had an account in Mt. Gox, had a butterfly labs miner, and I have no intention of selling for years.  I sold a bit last year, realized all my cost basis and my coins are in cold storage.  If Bitcoin were to suddenly become vulnerable to some kind of attack and the value goes to zero, I'm fine with that.  I'm still thousands and thousands of USD in realized gains.
Trying to say I wasn't around in the beginning days when I absolutely was shows your bias and talking out of your ass.

@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:19
Which is where Bitcoin was in 2013.  You could put in a zero fee and it'd be confirmed in the next block.  So it is accurate.  Bitcoin didn't have scaling problems in 2013 because it didn't have scale yet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:48:31
Perhaps, and if we're at $20 fees a year from now, I'll be more open to larger blocks.  I don't see it as necessary right now.  Fees are too high right now, but I believe higher adoption of segwit is coming, and Lightning network will both be online this year.  If that ends up not happening and we're stuck at $20 fees come 2019, I'll be far more willing to entertain a larger block. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:44:09

No way its any of them.  Satoshi was part of the techno-anarchist movement.  EM, Jobs, Gates are all solid capitalists.   You think any of them had the time to actually develop code in the early to mid 2000s and converse with people over forums?  There is absolutely no chance.  We know the group of people who helped make Bitcoin.  Satoshi wasn't the only one.  Hal Finney and Nick Szabo are the most likely candidates and Hal Finney died in 2014.  Finney was the first person to receive bitcoin in a transaction, from Satoshi.  What better way to do a test than to send Bitcoin to yourself?  Not a chance its Musk, Jobs or Gates.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:53:50

@_date: 2018-01-05 20:00:30
Transaction speed has nothing to do with the max number of coins and everything to do with how many transactions can fit inside of a block and how fast blocks are mined.  
Blocks are mined at 10 minutes on average.  You can fit around 2500 transactions per block (this changes depending on the particular details of the transactions) like is it segwit, multi-sig, bunch of input addresses (spammers or a wallet with a lot of change address).  
If there is more demand than ~2500 transactions/block then fees will rise due to supply and demand market forces in order to get your transaction in the next block.  This is why fees are high.  The demand (number of transactions going on) is higher than the supply (transactions per block the Bitcoin network can support)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:02:22
Doesn't have to be soon.  It can be years before we see 19K again.  So what?  See a 100% return over 2-5 years?  I'll take that any day.

I think this is the most likely scenario to happen.  Several years out, but I think its most likely as I believe Satoshi is dead (Hal Finney).  
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:49:49
That's been roughly my plan as well.  I realized some gains a bit ago and paid off my student loans.  At this point if Bitcoin were to go to zero, I've realized something like a 2500% gain on my initial buy-in.  At this point I can't lose no matter what.  I'm playing with house money so to speak.  I also believe in the tech, so I run my own full node and will open up a LN node sometime this year.  If it hits $50k-ish, I'll probably realize more gains and pay off the house.  
I have the luxury of having been holding since 2013-ish, so my case isn't typical though.  Every person's situation is different.

Please don't condescend me like I'm an uneducated child.  I'm well aware of the importance of money to a civilization.  Which was first done with bartering, then precious metals, then gold backed paper money, then completely inflationary government issued-money.
I pay taxes because I have to yes, but I would pay into the system anyway because its in my best interest.  Its in my best interest to know your grandmother wont die in the street because she's too poor.  Its in my best interest to pay for your child to go to school because we need a educated next generation to run the world.  I can believe in all of that AND also want to end government issued fiat money and the move to a decentralized, ruler-less monetary system.
I believe government issued money is going to die and nothing can stop that.  Crypto currencies are superior and have better uses, more secure, more open and neutral and less susceptible to government failures and monetary policies. I believe there will be a day when government's will accept crypto-currencies *as* legal tender.   I could be wrong, but I think the future of crypto is a very good thing.

I believe in the technology I know the upgrades coming this year will increase Bitcoin's usefulness and reduce transaction fees.  Its been to 19K before and I see no reason why it won't get there again.  I'm in this long-term.  I've been buying and holding since 2013.
Any purchase of Bitcoin is inherently speculative to some degree.  But like I said, this *is* a dip, its been higher previously and there are technological upgrades coming that will make Bitcoin more useful in the future and thus, will be more valuable in the future than it was even when it was previously valued at $19K.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:17:45

In this thread:

Chill the F out people.  This is a brand new technology.  There will be bumps.  Expecting tiny fee transactions confirming within minutes without any exceptions ever is just not realistic.  
I don't mind the high fees right now in the slightest.  Bitcoin right now doesn't work for buying a cup of coffee.  So what?  Yeah it'll take a few days to get your bitcoins out of Coinbase.  So what?  Not a big deal.  
This is a temporary situation.  Once Bitcoin core wallet supports segwit and the major exchanges do as well, we'll see this mempool situation alleviated.  Lightning will come 1H 2018.  So my suggestion?  Just hold, pay the low transaction fee and know it'll clear in a few days.  Not a big deal chill the F out.

We all do.  Right now consensus is no block size increase.  I agree with that.  High fees are temporary.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:34:29
Which is why the next upgrade should be Schnorr signatures.  Don't increase the pipe, make the data smaller.  We absolutely, categorically do not need 100MB blocks *ever*.  If we absolutely must increase the blocksize at a later time, it should be the absolute minimum amount and do it once.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:30:48
Pretty much.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:56
Absolutely.  When bitcoin hits $100,000, you'll wish you put some in way back when it was "low" at $17k.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:36:35
And going to 2, 4, 8 MB blocks wouldn't solve anything then if what you said was true.  And if we did that, we'd have a contentious hard fork with some percentage not agreeing with the fork and we'd have 1MB Bitcoin blockchain and a larger blockchain (like bcash).  This would fragment the community and dilute the value of Bitcoin.  
This is why the *only* solution is a 2nd layer.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:46:29
Yes, but how many people running full nodes now could still do that with a 8MB block size?  The blockchain would be gigantic and centralizes and reduces the number of nodes.  
I disagree with increasing the block size.  Implement actual scaling solutions now, then increase the block size later to multiply the effect those scaling improvements (segwit, lightning).

I'm done going back and forth with you.   You get to decide how fast your transaction is confirmed.  Want it fast, pay a higher fee.  Its market based supply/demand economics.  Its not extortion that you must pay X else you don't get confirmed.  Its your choice.  Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:47
No.  Because it won't fix anything.  Increasing the BTC blocksize would:
1) create a hard fork and dilute the value of Bitcoin
2) Be quickly gobbled up by people taking advantage of temporarily lower fees and the number of transactions would increase and fees would once again rise.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:57:06
Yes.  More or less the cost of electricity for that transaction.  So definitely below $1.  The catch is that we need mass adoption.  10-20% of nodes using lightning won't cut it.  That and segwit.  Both need to be used to actually see the benefit.  You won't see $1 or less transactions the day lightning goes live.  It'll still take time to roll it out.

If every wallet and exchange implemented segwit, yes we'd be much, much better off for the time being.  Wouldn't be a permanent solution as Bitcoin becomes more widespread but we wouldn't see the high tx and long transaction times we have now.

That's what Segwit is.  Already here we just need the exchanges to actually support it.  Segwit *is* effectively 2MB blocks and a theoretical 4MB max effective size (though I doubt it'll ever get that big).

Stop with the sky is falling down hysteria.  Bitcoin is where the internet was in 1992 and you're complaining about your 28.8 baud modem is so slow that the future of the internet is doomed.
High fees are temporary.  Segwit is still (slowly albeit) being adopted which will help alleviate fees.  Lightning network will further help this case.  Yeah, using Bitcoin today to buy a cup of coffee just isn't practical.  Neither was downloading a movie in 1992 on a 28.8 baud modem.  
There is absolutely no need for a fork right now.  Bitcoin is forging new ground and that means we have to get over some bumps and knock down some roadblocks in our way.  Once segwit has mass adoption and Lightning is activated and we *still* have high fees?  Ok, then we can talk.
Until then, settle the heck down.

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:54:22
2MB wouldn't do anything.  Transactions would quickly increase due to temporarily smaller fees and we'd be exactly where we are now.  Even 4MB wouldn't solve anything.  Even 8MB wouldn't fix anything.  There are far more users of Bitcoin than any other currency.  When the fees go down, traffic will *increase* and we're right back where we started.
We all just have to be patient.  This is a new technology.

Taxes are a good thing.  They are necessary in a civilized, advanced country.  We can argue how taxes are spent, how much are levied under what circumstances but we all live in a society and there are some things that can only be accomplished collectively.  That means taxes.  If you enjoy the benefits a country gives you (and there are too many to list) then you are morally and practically obligated to pitch in.
Go live on a deserted island if you think taxes are theft.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:17:13
BCH took the knee-jerk easy, short-term "fix".  8MB blocks is not a long-term solution.  Yes, Bitcoin Core should have implemented segwit sooner, but diverted their attention to the segwit2x attack first.  Once segwit gets pushed into Bitcoin core, there will be much greater adoption.  That effectively is a blocksize increase and we'll see relief in the mempool.   Once lightning is activated and adopted there will be no need for 8MB Bcash blocks.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:09
Disagree.  Bitcoin core is working on segwit now.  Once that's released we'll see much greater adoption.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:11:01
So why is the BCH price on gdax continuing to climb?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:31
Why's that?  Segwit is backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:30
Increasing the block size is a temporary and ultimately insufficient fix.  Make it 2MB and the mempool will get clogged up again quickly.  Bitcoin Core is working on Segwit.  That in of itself will bring down fees without having to increase the block size.  
I also disagree Lightning is a distant hope in the future.  We have a working lightning network *today* on the Bitcoin testnet and I expect it to go live Q1 2018.  Combined with segwit activation on Bitcoin core, we should see substantial alleviation of the mempool shortly.
Yes, this is frustrating now.  But look at the big picture.  Having long transactions and high fees for a few weeks (or even a few months) compared to the long-term goal of scalability is a small price to pay.   It makes much more sense to go to bigger blocks *after* the more sustainable scalability features (segwit / lightning) have been activated.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:40

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:29:23
No way to cancel.  You either wait it out (potentially weeks) or increase the fee to speed it up.

Depends on the fee.  If it was super low, it'll take awhile right now.

Yes, its optional and there is no downside to it.  By all means don't use bircoin as a means of transfer until segwit is adopted.  Its called a new technology.  You didn't download movies on your 28.8 baud modem in 1992 either.  Didn't mean the internet was doomed.

Ethereum *doesn't* have the same transaction level Bitcoin has.  Ethereum does not have the same number of users.  They can currently handle more transactions per second but there are way less transactions happening worldwide.  Its an 8 lane highway with less cars on it.  Bitcoin has way more cars and its currently clogged.  Instead of just adding lanes to the highway, we need side roads to alleviate the main expressway.  Adding more lanes doesn't fix the problem.  Might work temporarily, but it won't fundamentally scale forever.

Yep, you can go on and on about how poorly tax dollars are allocated and I'll agree with much of that.  Please read again what I said.  We can discuss how poorly taxes are spent as you have just done.  But how about roads?  Police, fire, food safety, education, and on and on.  Those are good things and completely require taxes.   The private sector cannot provide needed services when a profit incentive would completely undermine the entire purpose of that effort.  Such as back in the good ole days where we had private fire departments who would show up to your burning building and bid on how much they would accept to put the fire out.  You either paid them their extortion or watched your house burn down.  
A huge portion of our taxes are wasted and I strongly oppose how a lot of it is spent.  That doesn't mean you get rid of taxes entirely.  Just because its difficult to get taxes spent in a way that benefits society doesn't mean its not worth trying to continually get better.  Its called democracy.  Its on all of us to hold our leaders accountable and vote for those who will do the right thing.  But voting isn't enough, you need to actively participate in democracy and not be a passive citizen that checks a box every couple of years and then get to say you did your part.  Not good enough.
Democracy is hard.  Throwing up your hands and saying screw it all, taxes is theft is giving up.  It condemns a huge swath of our fellow citizens the benefits that some taxes *do* provide.

Segwit is an effective 2MB block size at a minimum and, given perfect conditions can be around 4MB (though this high is unlikely in practice).  
I will open up a .02 BTC lightning channel mysel when LN hits main net.  So I disagree with that.  
Mempool is clearing up right now, today.  Implement segwit + LN and then we move on to schnorr signatures.  If a blocksize increase was a soft fork, then I'd be all for it.  But it isn't.  It will fragment the value of Bitcoin and we'll have what we have now with Bcash only worse.  We'll have 3 forks of Bitcoin, each of which claiming to be the real bitcoin.  That, in my opinion, is worse than dealing with high fees and long transactions for the next few months or even a year.  Bitcoin crashed 90% in 2014 I think and took over a year to recover.  I'm perfectly OK with short-term pain for actual long term solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:16:04
Wouldn't fix anything.  Would just increase the number of transactions and the mempool would be just as clogged up as it is now.

24 word pass phrase. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:38:03
The short term block increase would be contentious.  There would not be consensus.  Just look at the heated debate here.  Plenty of people would not agree to a blocksize increase (I'm one of them) and I would continue to run my full node with the current 1MB block rules.  Hell, I'd turn on my old Asic Miner to continue the current consensus rules.  If I would do that, *a lot* of others would as well.  Think about what that would look like.  Bitcoin would be split even worse than it is now with BTC and BCH.  That is far worse outcome than what we have now with high fees and long transactions.  A hard fork needs overwhelming consensus and we absolutely do not have that right now so we should absolutely not do it.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:49:30
You're free to move to an alt coin.  I have no problem *at all* with the current path of Bitcoin.  On-chain transactions will have fees, and there should be.  Miners will need incentive outside of the Bitcoin rewards, we need a network that can function on transaction fees  alone.  I envision most transactions will be off-chain though, ala lightning network.  If you can't wait, there are plenty of alt coins to fit your immediate need.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:43:51
Low traffic on the Bitcoin network means lower fees.  Its supply and demand.  When there is more demand on the network (more pending transactions) than can be filled with the supply (blocks) then fees will go up to get your transaction priority.  If there is less traffic, that means less demand on the network, which means there will be lower fees to get those transactions processed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:33:52
Arbitrage from other exchanges perhaps.  Plenty of people don't realize trading is now on.  I did expect an immediate crash but we'll see after a couple hours.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:45:55
And Bitcoin is up 1500% this year.  Fees *will* get worse short term and I accept that.  Bcash made a knee-jerk short-term "solution" that only temporarily masks the symptoms.  I have no problem *at all* with the path Bitcoin is on.  I've been holding since 2014. This isn't my first bump in the road either.

@_date: 2017-12-27 15:04:13


Yes and no.  Increasing the base block size means a hard fork, that does mean the coin splits into two different coins which Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin gold and I "think" b2x will be doing.  
The other option is to *reduce the size of each transaction* which effectively *is* a block size increase.  This allows you to fit more transactions inside each block -- the same outcome a larger block does.  The upside of this is approach is that it does not necessarily mean you have to do a hard fork.  This is what segwit does.  It moves part of the transaction off the main blockchain, allowing more transactions to fit in a block and since its backwards compatible (segwit or non-segwit are both fully valid bitcoin transactions) it did not require a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:17

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:25:45
Yes.  I do.  Increasing the block size would (temporarily) increase throughput and lower fees.  Which then just encourages more people to transact and results in the same problem we had before.  Simple economics.  Same result happens with roads.  Big roads all jammed up.  Solution is add more lanes right?  Well actually..no.  Traffic studies show that just leads to more people using that road and it gets all clogged up again.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:33:27
You can turn it into a full Bitcoin node!  That's what I did.  The catch is the blocksize is too big to fit it on the standard SD card so I bought a cheapo 1TB (500GB would be fine as well) USB drive and have bitcoin-qt installed on it. It can take a very long time to initially sync, so I formatted the usb drive as exfat, and first installed bitcoin-qt on my main pc to get the blocksize synced.  Then plugged it into the raspberry pi and pointed the bitcoin-qt on initial install to the already synced blockchain.  Much faster to do it that way.
Took a little know-how and I had to google around a few days to figure out how to compile, but isn't too bad if you've ever dabbled with linux and command line.
This is pretty much all you gotta do to get bitcoin going on a raspberry pi.  Other than the steps above (external usb drive, format in exfat or ext3 if you have a main linux pc)
git clone -b v0.15.1  bitcoin-v0.15.1
cd bitcoin-v0.15.1
./configure CXXFLAGS="--param ggc-min-expand=1 --param ggc-min-heapsize=32768"  CPPFLAGS="-I/root/bitcoind/db4/include -O3" LDFLAGS="-L/root/bitcoind/db4/lib" --enable-upnp-default --with-gui --with-incompatible-bdb

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:39:50
It is supply and demand but not quite how you described.  When you send bitcoin, the sender chooses what fee he/she will be adding to that transaction.  Miners will (typically) choose to maximize their profits by including transactions that have the highest fees attached.  So miners don't directly, explicitly set fees, but rather its by supply and demand market forces.  So you can think of it in a way that yes Miners are setting the fees but not directly by colluding and determining "Fees will now be 500 Satoshis / byte".  It happens in a more emergent fashion.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:16:49
Depends on the transaction size.  I just transferred .0015BTC with 150 satoshi/byte fee (~$6.00) and it confirmed within an hour today. 
It can take more than a week for an unconfirmed transaction to get dropped.  But it can be longer if nodes continue to send out the Tx  
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:06
When was the first crash?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:10:45
Sure, more people changed their minds.  I have not.  I do not support increasing the blocksize right now.  There is still not consensus.  Given the discussions we see here constantly on r/bitcoin shows that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:59


No.  It wouldn't.  It would temporarily lower fees, which would just encourage more transactions and we're right back where we are today.  Just like adding lanes to a highway.  Its empirically shown that doesn't alleviate traffic, it just causes more people to use that highway and traffic doesn't get any better.  Supply and demand market economics are at work here.  Lowering fees would increase demand and the extra supply a larger blocksize would give would be quickly eaten up again and fees would once again rise.  That's why we need real scaling solutions.  Segwit is analagous to public transit.  You can fit more transactions in a block.  Lightning is off-chain and side roads that alleviate congestion on the main highways.  
Bitcoin today is bad at buying a cup of Coffee.  That's ok.  The internet was shitty at downloading music and videos in 1992 as well.  Doesn't mean the internet was doomed.  This is a new technology and there are growing pains.  Increasing the blocksize is a bandaid that only masks the symptoms temporarily.

Ledger nano S is a hardware wallet and supports all sorts of coins AND segwit.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:27
Yep.  The exchanges don't have a big incentive to do it either.  They're making a ton of money on these fees and it will cost them money to implement segwit.  
Some wallets today do have segwit, but it doesn't help very much until there's wide adoption.  Exchanges are the big one.  Once that gets implemented, we'll see lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:32:02
Nope.  Not really.  Yes, there will be news stories but you absolutely cannot determine how many people are in possession of how many bitcoins.  I have more than 1 bitcoin address.  Exchanges have more than 1 address but hold a significant portion.  But exchanges, while holding the private keys, are really holding other people's bitcoins, so does that count as 1 owner or many?  How about addresses that have been lost and those bitcoins locked away forever? Nobody effectively owns those anymore and we have no idea how many of those are out there.
So no.  You can speculate that a small amount of people hold a majority of bitcoins, and that *may* be true.  But there's no real way to tell one way or another.

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:46:11
Thank you.  Increasing block size now is a knee-jerk reaction.  Implementing segwit on the wallets and exchanges is much easier than try and get consensus of a larger blocksize.  Segwit *IS* a block size increase anyway effectively.  When bitcoin core and the exchanges implement segwit and we *still* have a giant backlog and huge fees, then we can talk.  Until then, first things first and that is segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:35:53
Yeah.  Up 1100% for the year and 30% from a month ago.  But I guess you're right.  Pack it up boys, game over.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:11:51
Bitcoin core wallet.  Next version (15.2?) Will have segwit enabled.  Few weeks I think?  Once that happens we should see a significant uptick.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:48
Its both.   Most people don't use Bitcoin core as their desktop main wallet.  But some do.  Its the reference wallet all other wallets are compared against though.  Its open source.  So when Bitcoin Core is released with Segwit, other wallets can take their implementation of segwit and incorporate it into their wallets as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:43
True, fair enough.  I'm at work so I can't keep a constant eye on it.  Its more of a token gesture and at least I have *something* on the order books.

100% true.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:52:17
Hence, segwit.  It *is* the interim solution and an effective blocksize increase
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:49
Yes, that is absolutely true and its dirty pool. *But* they have also said they will implement segwit in 2018.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:28:47
But it will also fork and cause dilution of the value of Bitcoin vs Bitcoin(segwit).  Much better to keep it all on a single line, backwards compatible and not split the value over two different forks.  
Once Bitcoin Core releases their next version, it will support Segwit and we will see much greater adoption.  We're in a temporary bumpy spot in the road as Bitcoin clears new ground.  Once Bitcoin Core supports Segwit, give it a month or two.  If we still see low adoption and high fees, then we'll talk.  Until then, proposing a segwit hard fork is premature.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:41:13


Disagree.  
Increasing the blockchain right now is a temporary solution that doesn't actually fix anything.  I will continue to support the 1MB block sizes until segwit is implemented in most wallets and exchanges.  That in of itself gives us an effective 2MB block size anyway.

No.  You absolutely get to decide the fee.  Its your choice how much of a fee you're willing to put on a transaction.  It is entirely your choice.  If you decide a 50 cent fee, so be it.  If you decide a $10 fee, so be it.  Its completely within the person sending the Bitcoin's control.

Short term volatility, growing in value massively over the next few years.  After, more widespread adoption, and market cap increases, stability will hopefully enter and it then becomes a useful currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:51


Maybe.  If that turns out to be the case I'll consider supporting a larger block.  When Bitcoin Core and Coinbase have Segwit and lightning go lives, if after a few months we still have a problem I'll probably consider a modest blocksize increase, not before then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:35
You're kidding right?  Must not have been around when Bitcoin crashed 90% a few years back.  We just hit 10K a few weeks ago.  It was at what, $1200 at the beginning of the year?  If you even ask that question you have no business investing much less investing in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:35:29
Yeah, it can take awhile.  Don't fret too much about it.  Took me a week to get it fully synced.  If you want a desktop wallet to spent bitcoin on, you can use other lightweight wallets that don't download the whole blockchain.
Bitcoin-qt is a full node, so it downloads the whole blockchain.  You're helping to secure the entire network.

It requires more hard drive space for those running fully validated nodes -- those that keep a history of the entire blockchain.  So ultimately those nodes will cost more and less of those nodes will exist.  Since there is no economic incentive to run a node, an argument can be made that means its more likely the more wealthy will run nodes and have a greater say in Bitcoin's path.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:31:15


Because it is the *only* long-term solution there is.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:47:53
If you didn't encrypt it, then any bitcoin wallet should be able to import it.  Uninstall/reinstall bitcoin core or install electrum or mycelium or any other bitcoin wallet and import the wallet.dat file.  If it wasn't encrypted, it'll just open.  If it was encrypted, you'll need the password.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:52:49
I'd much rather deal with that inconvenience at the moment and make the smarter decisions now, then a knee-jerk reaction that BCH did.  Who care if it takes a few days to get your Bitcoin from an exchange.  Not a big deal.  It takes 3-4 days for a bank ACH transfer.  Yeah, Bitcoin isn't good for buying a cup of Coffee right now.  Boo fucking hoo.  
All this instant gratification, impatient fear mongering is not helpful.  Have a little patience, know that this is a new technology and Bitcoin is forging new ground.  Yes, there are growing pains.  We had growing pains on the internet when people had 28.8 baud modems and were complaining about download speeds and saying this whole internet thing won't work.  
Implement Segwit in Bitcoin Core, activate Lightning and wait a couple months.  If after that we still have a big mempool issue, then we'll talk about increasing the block size.  I just don't see the current state of Bitcoin as a big problem right now *at all*.   Just hold your coins and be patient with the long transactions.  Not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:27:07
Segwit will be enabled in Bitcoin Core within a couple months.  Coinbase has said 2018.  Those two combined should see the majority of bitcoin transactions as Segwit transactions.  So less than a year.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:25
Segwit is being implemented on the Bitcoin Core wallet.  This is the reference wallet for Bitcoin made by the Core developers.  Segwit allows more transactions to be processed per second.  This will alleviate the backlog of transactions and thus, because there won't be as much competition to get a transaction confirmed, will lower fees.  Other wallets "should" be implementing segwit as well next year.
Coinbase, the major exchange, has said they also will be implementing Segwit next year.  
The next major development, lightning will allow off-chain transactions, which also will alleviate the demand for on-chain transactions and again lower fees.
Bad news is that Temporary will likely mean a few more months.  March/April seems like a reasonable estimate of when Bitcoin Core will have segwit supported in their wallet.  Could be a little sooner.  Lightning is probably more like 6 months out before its released.  Its working today on testnet but isn't quite ready to go live. 
Bitcoin is going through some growing pains right now and is a victim of its own success this year with the explosion of interest and people buying in.  This is a new technology and Bitcoin is forging new ground in a revolutionary change.  There will be bumps in the road and we're certainly hitting one of those now.  It will pass.  Small comfort today, but it will pass.

Temporary situation.  We're going through growing pains and Bitcoin is forging new ground.  There are going to be bumps in the road and anyone expecting $1,000 gains a day consistently is delusional.   Bitcoin Core's next update will have Segwit which will massively help.  The other wallets will soon follow.  Exchanges are the big roadblock right now and they have little incentive to implement segwit.  Lightning will be a game changer.  
I'll be buying BTC now and reaping the rewards later.  I don't give a damn it's not very good at buying a cup of Coffee today. A 28.8 baud modem wasn't good at downloading music in 1992 either.  Doesn't mean the internet was doomed, and neither is Bitcoin.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose.  Never invest more than  you could drop in a toilet and flush and have a panic attack about.  Value goes up and down.  Bitcoin is up 1800% this year and close to 100% over the past month.  If you believe in the technology, the day to day ups and downs doesn't phase you one bit.
Bitcoin could go down to $9000 and I won't be phased.  If you aren't ready to do the same, you aren't ready to invest in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:55:09
That was your choice by *choosing* a tiny fee.  It was entirely under your control to get a transaction confirmed by a fee of your choosing.  You get to decide if its never confirmed, confirmed after a week or confirmed in the next block.  It is 100%.  100% your choice and entirely under your control.

Yeah its not ideal right now but its still temporary.  Small consolation for those in Venezuela and I feel for them, but we have to look long-term here.  Coinbase dragging their feet on Segwit is a huge hinderence.  Segwit alone would be an enormous help and its ready *today*.  I have a segwit enabled wallet myself and Bitcoin Core enabling Segwit in the GUI can't come soon enough.  But increasing the blocksize of Bitcoin will be contentious.  Its a hard fork.  A good chunk of the Bitcoin community absolutely will not agree to it and we'll see a hard fork split with two Bitcoin chains.  It will be Segwit2x all over again.  Far easier and less contentious to push for Segwit ASAP than to increase the blocksize which won't actually solve anything.  It will just get quickly clogged up again and then we have 2 forks going on simultaneously. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:47:24
I disagree with a blocksize increase and so does most of the Bitcoin community.  Segwit *is* an effective blocksize increase.  Increasing the blocksize now is a knee-jerk reaction.  Its far better to deal with high fees and long transactions now in order to get actual scaling solutions implemented.  
If you want a larger blocksize, go put your investment in bitcoin cash.  I'll stay with team BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:29:54
Please quote me where I said that.  Oh wait.  I didn't.  Increasing the blocksize *wont* speed up transactions.  The best it will do is temporarily, for a short time speed up transactions.  But it will quickly get gobbled up, and the transactions will slow back down again and be no better than what we have now.  Adding lanes to a highway speeds up traffic until people realize there are open lanes and start using the highway again and before you know it, your massive infrastructure project is just as jammed as it was before and no faster than before.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:38:36
High fees are temporary.  Yeah its frustrating right now but so was downloading music files in 1992 over a 28.8 baud modem.  Plenty of people said the internet couldn't handle the traffic and it was a doomed experiment.  Bitcoin is a victim of its own success this year and is experiencing growing pains.  It.  Will.  Pass.  Stop expecting instant gratification and learn some goddamn patience.  Put in a low fee, and just accept it'll take 3-4 days.  Oh the horror.  How long does it take for a paper check to clear?  How long does it take and how high are the fees to send money overseas?  A lot more than Bitcoin right now.   Everyone who is all doom and gloom just needs to settle the F down and know that we're in a rapidly progressing new technology.  Its not mature yet and everyone needs to realize that and not scream about putting in some knee-jerk block size increase that doesn't actually solve the problem.  It only masks the symptoms.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:53
A hard fork is a relatively drastic thing to do and is not necessary right now.  Segwit effectively *is* a blocksize increase without having to hard fork.  Segwit alone will massively help the transaction backlog.  At this point, trying to increase the base blocksize of Bitcoin when Segwit in Bitcoin Core is around the corner doesn't make sense to me.  Far more disruptive to do a hard fork when the soft fork (Segwit) solution is close to being implemented.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:28:27
If exchanges implement segwit and Bitcoin Core wallet also does, that will absolutely help things.  Segwit is available *today*.  Lightning can practically eliminate fees for most day to day transactions. Schnorr signatures are in the works for next year which will further decrease transaction sizes to reduce fees.

As for solutions?

Its been a big problem for what, a few months?  Increasing the block size now is a knee-jerk reaction.  Yes, its causing headaches and is not ideal right now.  The first iphone *was* pretty shitty.  Couldn't even do sms or copy/paste.  
Bitcoin as it stands now is still better than a 3-4 day ach transfer from your bank, or an international wire transfer than can be $50+ worth of fees and still take a week or more to clear.  Yeah, its terrible to buy a cup of coffee.  This is a short-term problem and I see no need to say the sky is falling and jump on a larger block.  That will make it more difficult for people to run full nodes and a modest 2MB block will get clogged in a few days anyway as more people start using it and we'll be right back where we are today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:31
Because Bitcoin today is where the internet was in 1992.  Plenty of people were saying the internet couldn't scale because your 28.8 baud modem took days to download a single song.   Bitcoin is forging new ground and is working on actual scaling solutions, but it takes time.  Need to learn a little patience and understand this is a brand new revolutionary technology.  Alt coins don't have anywhere near the user-base Bitcoin does.  
This is a temporary situation.  I don't give a crap Bitcoin is terrible for buying a cup of Coffee.  I believe in the technology and scaling solutions that will actually work.  Increasing the blocksize for Bitcoin wouldn't solve anything.  Transactions would quickly spike to take advantage of temporarily lower fees, and the mempool would get clogged up again and fees would once again rise.  Only then we made a hard fork of Bitcoin, diluted its value and discourages independent people from running their own full-node, which secures the network.

@_date: 2017-12-21 02:24:46
Segwit is not 1.7, its about 2MB with a max, given best conditions of 4MB.  Bitcoin core is the farthest thing from irrelevant you can get.  It is *the* reference wallet.  That's why adoption rate is low.  Exchanges are dragging their feet as well with Segwit but it is coming.  Exchanges adopting Segwit would be an enormous help.  That in of itself will lower fees and allow people to transfer their entire balance to a segwit address for a small, one-time fee and they're good to go.  
I categorically disagree with moving to a larger Bitcoin block.  It is not needed.  It does not matter that you can't use Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee right now.  Small purchases are low priority when compared to the path of long-term scalability.  
Get Segwit in Bitcoin Core and the exchanges, activate lightning, wait a couple months and we'll see.  If transactions are still slow with high fees then I'll consider supporting a larger block.  Until then,  I will gladly, *gladly* live with high transaction fees for quick transfers.  I make $3-5 fee transfers semi-regularly and it takes maybe 6-8 hours.  Helluva lot better than a western union fee or bank ACH transfer that can take 3-4 days.  Bitcoin as it stands now is still better than writing a check or for sending money overseas.  It will get better.  Bitcoin is forging new ground, and experiencing growing pains.  It is not an emergency.  
Currently the Market agrees and values Bitcoin more than Bcash.  The node and miners also agree and are in consensus.  Your opinion is the minority.

Still failed.  Same spot, same errors.  May just have to bite the bullet and start completely over.  Start from scratch, nuke everything, re-download the blockchain (ugh) and start anew.

I'm buying as much as I can right now.  This isn't a get quick rich scheme.  If you have reasons to believe in the technology and that it will spread and be more widely adopted over the years buy buy buy.  I'll decide if my buys were a good decision in 10 years.  I don't give a damn about drops over a few weeks or even months.

I remember selling my bch the very day coinbase let you.  I think it was around $3400.  Good day, good day.

Means "cheap" coins up for sale again.  Time to buy the dip.

Then you can choose to keep using Ecdsa until such time you are convinced its battle tested.  It will be backwards compatible.

Oh no! Its only up 15% over the past 3 months, 700% from a year ago and 2000% from 2 years ago.  
Pack it up boys.  Game over.

I want to know what happens when we have quantum computers and algorithms that will be able to crack private keys.  Sure, we'll be able to migrate to quantum safe encryption, but that only works if you have the private key initially.  All those "lost" private keys will be able to get cracked and those Bitcoins recovered.  Satoshi's stash will be a gigantic target.

Peddling pseudo half-truths and enabling logical fallacies with no rational reasons to believe what they say are true.  Better?
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:06:41
True, but we can't let technology stagnant because we're too risk averse to move to a superior technology.  Schnorr signatures have significant upsides.  We should beat on it for awhile on test net, and it'll slowly get adopted on main net.  If we were too risk averse for implementing segwit, we'd be in a world of hurt today.  We need to accept some risks.  I personally think its worth the risk to move ahead with Schnorr.

Lots of people have ideas, but nobody has any good ones.  That's why its a market.  If anyone had an actual good idea, the market would go to that point.  It could explode back to 11K in a couple hours or head down to 6K in a couple hours, or stay more or less where its at for weeks.  
Nobody knows, nobody can know, nobody will *ever* know what the market will do.

His entire redefining "truth" as what is useful is intellectually dishonest.  It allows him to shoe-horn in that religion and specifically Christianity is true because its survived for a couple thousand years.  He uses motivated reasoning to backward justify his already held beliefs.

we already have versions of quantum computers (quantum annealing) and very limited, not very useful more general-ish ones in labs around the world.  Quantum computers are going to be a reality in the not too distant future.

Doesn't work real well when you bought in at $50.  Every dip is still a peak compared to that cost basis.

Says me thats been holding since 2012 and paid off my student loans and bought a new car with a fraction of my holdings.  I'm still up something like 5000% of my original investment.  Bitcoin is still up around 15% from three months ago, 700% from a year ago, and 2000% from two years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:39:21
HODLing still makes sense even if you bought at 19k.  That's the whole damn point.  Its a long-term view.

Or somehow come up with a way for the proof of work algorithm itself serve a useful function.  No idea what that would be or if that's even technically feasible.

Same here.  Though about once a month bitcoin-qt seems to just die and I have to manually restart it.  I wanted to convert it to a lightning node when it hits mainnet, but I am concerned about dropping off the network occasionally.
