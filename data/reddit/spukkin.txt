at least 5 independent teams developing node software, roadmap includes 2 scheduled hardforks per year to roll out clean upgrades, current research projects include gigablock testnet:       
and Graphene Block Propagation:

oh yeah, also re-enabled opcodes are coming:

yes, because they have invested the most capital and they hold many coins. the idea that miners are somehow malicious actors doesn't make any sense at all.  All the large chinese miners are self-funded through early bitcoin profits and have never received investment funds from banking interests, unlike certain companies that are heavily involved in bitcoincore code development who will remain unnamed.

are you both idiots or just lying? pick one.

these are two examples of research being conducted with a view towards scaling bitcoin using bigger blocks. the protocol code will be adapted to integrate these technologies. currently bch can handle 8x the number of transactions of btc without any changes to the code, for all of bitcoin core's busy work they still can't fix the network, it's broken.

and indeed former BTC users are now turning to Visa and Dogecoin. is that a win?  good luck!

i don't know anything about bcash, don't think that project has been released yet.  but as for the gigablock testnet, that project is being conducted by Bitcoin unlimited. the Bitcoin unlimited node software is compatible with the version of bitcoin known as bitcoin cash. so yes, the BU team is developing software for bitcoin cash.   the Graphene project is working on a block propagation technology that according to the white paper "Graphene blocks are a fraction of the size of related methods, such as Compact Blocks"  and if successful would likely be used by bitcoin cash.

why would you just make stuff up that's so easy to debunk? are you stupid or just a liar? or both?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:00:52
so is that your criteria for a functional cryptocurrency? how much code and how many coders?  what about: able to reliably and cheaply send transactions?

90% of hashrate was ready to fork to bigger blocks via segwit2x. miners have been begging for bigger blocks for years because they knew this would happen. miners are not the enemy...

"Bitcoin core please stop such attacks"
quick, someone call the bitcoin police! call the UN!  call the authorities!  call your mom!

sounds great! sign me up!

"Bitcoin blocks are nearing capacity and regularly get full. Don't wait until transaction fees go up to open Lightning Channels. Do it now while its cheap."
that doesn't make sense.  i thought segwit and batching, etc is making more capacity and keeping fees low?

how strange that "SJW's" ie "people that fight for justice" are considered such an annoyance.

bitcoin cash is bitcoin you sad fools.
