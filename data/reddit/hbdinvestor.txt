There's nothing wrong with insider trading
I'm a libertarian
Both people on both sides of the trade willingly made their exchange
It's the free market, nothing is stopping you from colluding with other people to dump coins

Nope bitcoin has intrinsic value, in order to create that bitcoin a lot of energy and equipment was used to mine it 
Bitcoin will never be worth zero
That's what gives bitcoin it's value

You do realize that bitcoin is predicted to be worth 1 million per coin? You'd be an idiot to sell out now
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:52:53
Bitcoin is predicted to hit 1 million per coin, Why would they cash out now?

Nope not manipulation 
Bob bought something for less and sold it for more
The vast majority of the people in this subreddit are doing the same thing hoping they could sell their coin for more than whst they paid in the future

Nobody got scammed
Bob sold apples for 19k, then bought bananas for 2k then sold the bananas for 8k, then bought back into apples for 15k
Nothing that Bob did was illegal or a scam
All trades were done with willing participants

Actually this is good for bitcoin 
This will encourage more people to start using custom Linux distros instead of windows 10 and encourage more people to use paper wallets

If the ceo dumps all his shares, other people still have to buy his shares.
Nobody put a gun to their head and forced them to buy
It was a willing transaction from both parties
The people who bought coin at 20k, willingly created a coin base account and willing put a purchase order for coins at 20k
This is why insider trading shouldn't be a crime
It's no different than buying bitcoin at $500, waiting for a year then selling it for 20k
You bought bitcoin at 500 based on insider information that it was worth more in the future

It's called network effect, everybody needs a Facebook account because everybody else has a Facebook account, everybody uses windows instead of Linux because most of the software is designed to run on Windows. 
While bitcoin going to zero is unlikely (zerohedgers will dump their lifesavings into crypto), it either goes to the moon or it doesn't
In order to go to the moon, bitcoin needs to become Facebook otherwise it whithers and dies as zerohedgers retire and start sending, this is not likely to happen since the big boys pulled out. Any sane investor can see that unless the big boys come back there is no way bitcoin can go back to its former glory.

Bitcoin costing a lot of energy is good for bitcoin, it makes it impossible to attack thus making transactions more secure.
Using a lot of energy makes bitcoin more valuable, because it Costs more to mine it.

Taxation is theft plain and simple, the world would be better if nobody paid taxes

Don't forget the miners that need to get paid for running the casino, last I checked bitcoin consumed as much electricity as norway and they need to pay for rent and for new equipment 
All the electricity costs etc... come from people buying in.

If you sold at 4200 you would have more capital to buy back in at 3,000
Always buy and only sell if profitable is not a sound investment advice 
In a market all gains must come from losses
Especially since bitcoin has negative dividends
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:43:18
Every rational actor in the market wants to maximize gains and minimize losses. 
If I predict other people are going to sell, and I sell before they do and then buy back in later I can make free money
And yes this is basically a stock market except with negative dividends

Basic investing 101
If the price was $5,000 and you bought at the peak if you sell for $4200 and then bought back in at the bottom say $3000
Instead of losing 2,000 per coin, you now lost 800 per coin.
If it goes to 10k a year later your profit is now 5k vs (7k minus 800) 6200 per coin
So selling at a loss is not a bad idea because if you predict the bottom you can minimize your losses

Bitcoin will never crash, bitcoin is designed to continously increase in value.
Every week people will get their paychecks and they will use those paychecks to buy bitcoin.
So the price of bitcoin will always increase in the long run

Bitcoins value will always increase
People will always get paychecks and they will use those paychecks to buy bitcoin. When people buy bitcoin the price of it will go up. 
So there is always more and more money flowing into bitcoin. So the price will increase to infinity if given enough time

Bitcoin is guaranteed to increase in price, everyone will keep dumping their paychecks to buy more, so the price of bitcoin will always increase. 
one million for a bitcoin in the future is guaranteed 
Everybody in is a guaranteed millionaire as long as they keep buying
