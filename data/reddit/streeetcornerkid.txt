A burst bubble is a correction.
After returning to the mean, there is absolutely no reason it cannot bubble again in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:27:29
I agree, but using the log graph as a basis for what should continue to happen indicates that the crash should lose 80% of its value over the course of several years.  If you look at the previous ones, they had large blips down, then up, then down, then up, and so forth before they ever found their bottom.  
If we are indeed in a similar crash, this down will raise again but fail to overtake the ATH and eventually keep falling until we lose 80% of 20,000 or ~ $4,000.

Economics happens.  The bitcoin network can run on much less hashpower than it does today.  The only reason energy consumption is so high is because miners are competing for the $$ reward.  If the energy supply becomes less, power becomes more expensive.  If power becomes more expensive than it is worth to mine bitcoin, miners will stop mining.  The competition for the reward will go down, which means the energy consumption will go down.  The difficulty level adjusts to the available hashpower, meaning bitcoin continues to function as normal.

Why would a government invalidate their fiat currency?  There is no reason for them to do that.  What would instead happen is the value of that currency would go down due to people not wanting it.  But this is how everything works already.  If i decide that silver is more useful than gold, i would choose to buy silver.  But most people find gold more useful and valuable than silver.  Its not unfair if you're the last one holding silver to expect to have to pay more to change it into gold than everyone else.  It's how markets work, early bird gets the worm

You're very liberal with your use of "bear market".  Bitcoin has done this several times over the last year and bounced right back.
Don't forget that there are still posts everyday of people waiting to get verified.  Exchanges couldn't keep up with the numbers of people wanting to get in.  It could be that they are waiting a bit for cheaper coins.  As soon as the price starts a rebound, they'll all be buying in with hopes not to miss out.

Actually, no.  Your explanation shows you don't know how it works.  If 90% of hashpower leaves the network tomorrow, the difficulty adjusts and we can still perform the same number of transactions with less hashpower.
The reason the hashpower is so high and increasing is due to competition for the reward.  It is independent of the number of transactions.

Transactions are not anonymous.  The entire ledger is public.  If you have purchased on an exchange, they can follow your bitcoin every hop of the way.  The more transparent each individual becomes with their dealings, the harder it is for the remaining individuals to remain anonymous.
For instance, you buy on an exchange.  You sell elsewhere in-person thinking this shields you from taxation.  The person you sold to, however, is more transparent and sells on an exchange afterwards.  If they know that person now owns the bitcoin they in turn know that you sold it to them, and because the transaction history is public they can most likely pinpoint the exact moment and the price it was worth when you sold it to them.

It sells at whatever price point you are willing to sell and someone else is willing to buy.
The amount of profit you make factors all of the prices you bought it at into the equation.  You bought 100/10,000 + 100/11,000 + 50/12000 bitcoin.  = ~.0233 bitcoin.  When you sell, you sell at the current market price. 
If the market price was 15,000, you would get 15000*.0233 = ~$350 for putting $250 in. = $100 profit.

Fees were under 3 dollars per transaction mere weeks ago.  The fee problem is a recent one, and there are several proposals in the works to solve it.  
That being said, bitcoin hasn't been a $20 transaction type of money for a while.  It is more akin to Gold, in that you can store hundreds, thousands, or millions of dollars of value using it rather than storing it in a bank account with shitty returns on a fiat currency that inflates faster than those returns.

I would imagine governments would find a way to identify users.  For instance, they might put regulation on businesses to identify customers and then use that as a basis to build identities on the blockchain.

Bitcoin can be divided into very small portions.  
The reason exchanges won't allow you to move an amount such as .001, is because it costs them too much in fees to move that amount for what it is worth.
Fast forward 5 years, .001 bitcoin is now worth 100x as much, they will remove such a restriction because it doesn't cost them too much anymore (comparatively).
Every time bitcoin is lost, the remaining supply gains in value (assuming demand stays the same).
If you control your own private keys, you can consolidate "change" into a single wallet.  So, if there are times when the mempool isn't clogged up and fees are less, this is a good time to move around your change.  
As far as the exchange goes, you need to operate within their parameters.

Actually, you're fully responsible for your behavior and it decreases risk taking behavior in a few ways:
 1) Insurers will often only provide insurance if the potential customer adheres to recommendations from the insurance company.  Example, you need a business policy but your walkway doesn't have a railing.  The insurance company tells you they will only insure you if you put the railing in.  This decreases your risk as a win-win for the insurer and the insured.
2) Most insurance companies will increase your rates if you have more than 1 claim in a certain period of time.  This decreases risk taking behavior because you don't want to pay higher rates.


Needs an example.  The insurance company profits, yes.  That's because it is a company.  Few companies are not-for-profit, so your argument is the same thing as saying that the local gas station is a scam.  Businesses need to make money, otherwise they can't pay their employees.


If insurance weren't mandatory in certain situations, you are infringing upon another's freedom if you are liable for their loss and have no way to pay them.
Take auto insurance. If you were hit by some drunk guy without insurance and incurred large medical expenses, how is it fair that he doesn't have a way to pay you?  That is way worse than telling someone that they have to have insurance if they want to drive.
Take home insurance.  There is no mandatory law requiring you to buy it - Only banks telling you they are only willing to lend you money if you get it.  This isn't insurer's fault.  this is a company not wanting to lend you money unless they know you are covered if something were to happen.
Insurance is only mandatory by law in very few facets, and each of them has a damn good reason - to protect others from your actions.
Your argument is like saying "There shouldn't be a law preventing me from murdering others, it is antithetical to my freedom".  There are certain times where your freedom can't be left intact, and that's when it has potential to ruin freedom for others.
The best part is, I'm assuming by your last comment that you are completely against regulation in general.  Yet, regulation is the only thing that absolutely keeps Insurance companies honest!  Any time an insurance company wants to set rates for a specific coverage, they have to have it filed and approved by a state regulator.  If those regulations weren't there, an insurance company could charge you whatever they wanted, which would make it so they could be "scammy".  However, the profit made by an insurance company is regulated, so you really can't say they're a scam.

To "switch off the crypto scene", they would need to turn the Internet off.  I'd say my argument is perfectly valid, and you're the one in denial if you can't see that.   Case study:
Scenario A;  Seize a person's gold.  Step 1: Find Gold  Step 2: Take Gold.
Scenario B; Seize a person's crypto.  Step 1: Find crypto (much easier to hide than gold).  I could hide my crypto address in the pixels of a digital picture if I want. Step 2:  Identify the owner of the crypto.  Step 3: Torture that owner until they give away the encryption password.  
It doesn't take much intelligence to see that Scenario 2 is much more unlikely than Scenario 1.  
The other thing you mentioned, switching off crypto, isn't Seizing an asset.  It's blocking an asset.  The reason they seized gold was because they wanted to gain the value from it.  Blocking an asset doesn't give them its value, and as such, there is much less incentive for them to do so.  I think I've made my point quite clearly, and your continued refusal to accept that I have made a valid argument shows that you really aren't worth spending time debating with.  Good day.

Gains tax.  Your net gain - If you bought 1 bitcoin at $10,000 and sold it at $20,000, you have made a gain of $10,000.
You pay tax on the $10,000, but you only measure your gain when you either:
a) Spend the bitcoin as a bitcoin.
or 
b) convert the bitcoin into fiat.

No address ever expires.  It is good practice to generate new addresses for each transaction to preserve the pseudo-anonymous properties of bitcoin.  A public address will always be valid for the corresponding private address, but you want to make sure you control that private key before sending money to it.  Example, if coinbase gave you an address to deposit to, I would only use it once.  They may not be monitoring the old ones.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:15:01
I always pictured using a bankroll to facilitate arbitrage.
Put the same amount of money in two or more exchanges.  If the price fluctuates wildly between two, initiate a sell on the higher one (assuming a stable market), initiate a transfer on the lower one and a buy.
this means you need cash and bitcoin on both.  And the market needs to be fairly steady - Why sell on any exchange if everyone is bullish?
I don't have any experience doing this, but I've thought about how I would generate a program to do this automatically.
Eventually, you'll run out of funds on one of the exchanges, and you need to do a reset.

It's a scam until you need it.  The entire point of insurance is to insure you from the risks you take (imagine that).  If you're someone who never experiences a loss due to the risks you take, it seems like a scam.  To the person who does experience that loss, it is an absolute necessity.

If your transactions are taking days or even weeks to confirm, you're doing it wrong.  Blocks are mined every ten minutes.

I've not had any complaints using Gemini for the last year.  They have been brought down once by the increased volume (two weeks ago), whereas coinbase goes down every single time there is a price crash.  I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the amount of users using coinbase vs. Gemini, but I'm much more confident in the twins' ability to scale their business based upon my experience with them thus far.  They run their business in a very professional manner.
Plus, they offer 30 free btc withdrawals per month.  Something they have continued to honor, despite very large fees of late.

No, it is an issue with the way bitcoin works - A transaction is only valid once written to a block.  Since different fees give different transactions priority, money spent in a later transaction can in fact be seen as the first transaction by the network.
A good practice is to wait for 3 confirmations - This essentially guarantees the first transaction will be processed first.  1 Confirmation with a decent sized fee is usually enough to satisfy most people, but most merchant services require 3 or 6 confirmations before they consider the transaction as good as done.

There are a lot of academic debates about what will happen when the mining reward dwindles down near zero.  Basically, people will have to pay higher fees for transactions in the current model.  
It's somewhat pointless to get to wrapped up in this debate though, right now.  It will be several years before cost to mine to reward ratio becomes a problem, and the world will be quite different.
I personally believe that we will have breakthroughs in computing power and energy generation that will solve most of those problems.  
The other thing is, bitcoin software can be updated if enough of the nodes agree on a specific update.  They basically just set a flag on their software that says they opt into a software change.  It requires a high consensus, but if something truly threatens the bitcoin system there is a way to evolve bitcoin.

I don't know if you can easily transfer bitcoin in a will..  Due to the need to know your passphrase and hold the private key, it seems to me it is just easier to inform your next of kin how to retrieve the money if something were to happen to you.  They would have to have a basic understanding of how to utilize the technology, and I don't see that being both easy to describe and secure if included in a will.  I basically made my gf sit with me for 30 minutes while I explained what she would need to do in order to retrieve our btc.

According to the bitcoin user base, bitcoin relates to approximately $1000 USD of physical resources.  Unfortunately, you need to convert it to fiat first to purchase most of those physical resources.  Every day, however, more of the sellers of those resources take btc directly.  This is part of the reason why the value continues to increase.

It wasn't clear because you're saying it's a misconception that full blocks is bad for bitcoin.  If you have fewer transactions because people aren't willing to pay higher fees, then you have people leaving the market.  People leaving the market isn't good for bitcoin.  If people don't leave the market, then they're all paying higher fees, which means the blocks are still full.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:31:44

Well, gee.  Maybe you should ask u/cryptobanks to clarify his opinion instead of jumping down his throat.
Does it really matter which one is approved from a "The price will explode" standpoint?  No.  You're holding to semantics super hard while criticizing someone.  
It seemed clear to me that when he said maybe it will happen down the road he was talking about a different ETF *after* the COIN ETF is rejected.  Instead of asking him to clarify what he meant you told him to educate himself like he's an idiot, when in fact, you just sound like an asshole.
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:02:04
Correct, it only counts for most people in the context of which they would spend the money, which is still currently fiat for most.  You only assess your loss or gain once you transfer it into the currency you're going to utilize to pay for things.  So, if you're a true hodler, you won't be able to assess a loss or a profit until you stop hodling.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:44:26
It's a programming consideration.  The 21 million aren't "there in the first place", but the software used by all of the nodes and miners "agrees" to change the reward (# of released bitcoins) by cutting it in half in a predetermined fashion.  On day 1, there was 0 bitcoins.  After 100 years, there will be 21 million.  Unless all of the nodes agree to update the software to continue mining, there will never be anymore created after that 100 years.

From his point of view that full blocks won't harm BTC, it is.  If market demand drops because the fees have been raised too high, then this is indeed indicative that full blocks mean bitcoin is failing.  Driving bitcoiners out of the market means a market that does not grow.  If bitcoin is truly going to be the revolutionary tech that shakes up the world, as everyone in this sub hopes, the market needs to keep growing.  A 17 billion market cap is pretty insignificant overall.

Have you verified whether the transaction was confirmed using blockchain.info?  Could be your wallet loading the blockchain - If it hasn't "caught up" to this weeks transactions, it might look like you don't have the coin in your wallet while the whole network may agree you own the coin already.
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:33:20
Eventually, high-value transactions will fill up the blocks and you're faced with the same exact issue.  At that point, yes, people will leave the market because they don't want to pay a ridiculously high fee and still have their transaction back-logged.

.0001 bitcoin isn't worth $100 and that's the transaction fee that you pay miners to mine your block.  When did you install your multibit wallet?  Has it finished loading the entire blockchain yet?  Your transaction on the 21st will be towards the very end of the chain, so if your wallet hasn't finished loading it it won't "see" the transaction.  Look up your transaction on blockchain.info to see if it's at least been confirmed.

I understand high-level that "all transactions are registered on the public blockchain".  I also (believe that I) understand the nature of creating public keys from private keys.  
What I don't understand, is how a transaction written with a public key on a blockchain is connected to a different public key associated with the same private address on the blockchain since you can't reverse engineer a public key to achieve a private key.

What I don't understand is why people feel the need to finish any opinion article on what they think a market will do with such a disclaimer.

Right now, trading btc is seeming less appealing to some Chinese traders after the regulation, and the temporary month-long freeze on btc withdrawals to combat money laundering forces the sale of btc rather than moving it out of the exchange.  
Because of this, there is a higher frenzy of selling in China, which is why it is cheaper to buy a bitcoin there.  China used to account for such high levels of trade before the regulation was introduced, that prices in China used to be higher than in US.

Yes, using PKI encryption.  Every person is responsible for protecting their own private key.  Anyone running the bitcoin software can generate a new key pair - However, the private key is your wallet, not your bitcoin.  You maintain a private key for your wallet, meaning any bitcoin that was previously mined can be sent to a corresponding public key for that wallet.  You protect your private key, so no, there isn't a guy in a mansion keeping track.  
After a bitcoin is mined, any transfer of that coin is on the public blockchain that everyone is keeping track of.  The bitcoins in your wallet are only legitimate because there is a record tracing every transaction that bitcoin has been involved with since its minting during the mining process.  Here is a really good video explaining a lot of the science.  If you don't mind feeling like you're sitting in a Comp Sci class, it is really informative.

If everyone uses higher fees, the blocks will still be full.  Using a higher fee doesn't make the blocks any less full.  Every single transaction could be issued with a higher fee, but there will still be a 'loser' that has to wait with backlogged transactions. 
Changing the amount of fees you pay doesn't decrease fullness of blocks.  Your logic is fundamentally flawed.

I think it depends totally on the ETF decision.  My guess is that China is banking (no pun intended) on it not being approved.  
The compound effect of the ETF not being approved with the rush of Chinese investors to cash out could put a huge dent in the BTC price, which is probably why they are doing it.
On the flip-side, if the ETF is approved it means all of the Chinese hodlers will get a good piece of the action coming from the US, also not a bad thing for the Chinese as a whole.

I don't consider being a "follower" of a religion automatically making you a good person.  The concept of sin exists in many ideologies and even non-religious people encounter it and can see that too much sin can be a bad thing.  
Too many people think simply being part of a church makes them a good person.  If you only go because you think you're supposed to and because it is ingrained in your community, you've missed the point.  I sampled many religions when I was younger, but ultimately decided I didn't need to believe there was a God to be a good person.  Especially when you look at all of the hypocrites that consider themselves religious but do and advocate for awful things.
At the end of the day, we're all human and will sin.  If you're having doubts about whether you should be trying to profit off of a fair market, then maybe you shouldn't participate in that market.  I've found that I can live with a lot of sin as long as that sin doesn't directly hurt someone else because of my actions.  I don't consider participating in a fair market as directly hurting someone else because each person knows the risk and only the whales can truly have a noticeable effect on that market.

If you just want to get some btc for a long term investment, just take other people's listings. 
As for when, that depends on whether you think the ETF will be approved.  If you think it will be approved, I'd say buy right now.  If you think it will be declined, wait.  No one knows what will happen so it's really a wager based upon your gut.  Good luck, and welcome to the community!

Honestly, that 14 grand has large potential to be 30 grand by the end of the year. Also, LBC really isn't "meet some dude in an alley".  As the seller, he could easily make a 5% premium on the coins and sell them pretty regularly.

If it is denied, buy $1000 a week or so after the rejection, once the price has dipped nice and low.
The $50-100 a week is good for those that feel they don't have expendable income, OR, for those that want to lower the risk of buying into a volatile market if it's risky the price will crash.  Bitcoin, however, has pretty much been climbing steadily for the last couple years, so as long as you can avoid an EFT denial risk, you'd make more money by investing it immediately than spreading it.  
My opinion, of course :).  Everyone should do what they're comfortable with.

1)  There has to be some mechanism to control supply.  The miners are both creating new bitcoins and writing new transactions to the blockchain.  Without miners, the blockchain wouldn't get written and there wouldn't be a way to note transactions.  Miners are rewarded so they have incentive to keep mining for everyone else using bitcoin.  They keep making it harder to mine, so that they can limit the supply of bitcoin.  Miners have to work harder and get paid half as much every so many years.  If they didn't do this, bitcoin would be inflationary like other currencies (ie. they keep printing out dollars), and the bitcoins would lose value.
2) Maybe it was used by drug dealers and kidnappers in the beginning because they were the first to see its usefulness, but it is far from that today.  Many people invest in bitcoin as a hedge fund, others use it for many transactions every day.  In Japan, it is recognized as a national currency and there are over 1000 bitcoin atms spread out across the world.  You can buy Amazon gift cards using bitcoin ~~Amazon will let you pay in bitcoin~~ :).  That being said, each country recognizes it differently.  In the USA, it is seen as a commodity, not a legal tender. That doesn't change the fact that you can use it like legal tender, though.  It is up to the people using it to determine it's usefullness.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:53:27
Yes, every transaction charges fees, which is why larger transactions are favorable.  Fee amount is based upon the data size of the transaction, not the value.  For the second question, read about cryptographic collisions.  I'm not an expert but they are possible but extremely unlikely as you guessed.  I'm pretty sure someone found the first collision for like SHA1 or something.. most encryptions are up to 256 bits, so imagine trying to collide 256 when each number grows exponentially more difficult.

I think the problem is that people use the word "liberal" too liberally.  
Also, trying to infer that a person either SUPPORTs Obama or DOESN'T SUPPORT Obama is too cut and dry.  
Saying you 100% support or don't support a politician such as Obama indicates that you're politically retarded, and you just follow party lines.  
A person that actually pays attention to politics draws opinions about a politician's stance on individual issues rather than just trying to cover them all with a blanket statement.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:49:35
I found the answer I was looking for in a video.  The part that I was missing is that your private key doesn't hold a bitcoin "balance".  I was picturing my private key as a safe that could be loaded up with coins.  
Since you can create new public keys from a private key, I didn't see how (using your example above) the police could know that I ever exchanged with his public addresses if I could just create a new one that had no discover-able link to the previous one they sent.
However, I don't have a "balance" of bitcoins in my private address.  I have a series of "unsent transactions" that are only valid because of their link to previous transactions that link all the way back to the mined coin, which would include the transaction involving the drug dealer and my other "supposed" public key.
Thanks for the help.

People just have short attention spans.  There wasn't any major milestone coming up the last few years besides the ETF and the price has increased steadily long term.  People off of the ETF hype are now getting all negatively hyped about this potential hard fork.  Most people are saying it won't happen.  
People were arguing about scaling before the drop, and people will continue to argue about it, but if the fork itself doesn't happen in the next few weeks, the REAL driver of bitcoin price will kick back in, everyone will realize this is just FUD, and hopefully buy back in. [Zoom out!](

Not in the short-term.  Think if bitcoins were physical assets you could break in half.  After a hard fork, you will own a total of one bitcoin, but it will have essentially been split in half.  The value of "BCC" and "BTU" together would make up the total value of a bitcoin (trading at about 960 right now), so in the immediate sense the price of a single BTU or BCC cannot be worth that 960 alone.
In the long term, it will be good because one will prevail and the other will likely die, meaning there won't be all this divisiveness, meaning the winning crypto will have that FUD stop hindering it's ability to thrive.
In the short term, it will be confusing for the average bitcoin user, the price will tank due to investors choosing to sit on the sidelines until one wins, and the value will be split between two competing coins.

Research cold storage to learn the best way to keep your coin safe.  Flash drives work well if you make a couple copies, or you could invest in a hardware wallet.  After that, you either go to an exchange such as Gemini, let them verify your identity, and you can start buying them.  Or, if you care about anonymity, you go to localbitcoins.com and do a cash deposit at a bank or meet in person, or you can find a bitcoin atm.  Some bitcoin atms require identity verification.
Do not keep coins on exchanges for long periods of time if you aren't going to trade regularly.  It's only your coin if you control the address in a wallet on your device.

You've got an essential understanding.  
As for question 3), I can say that it is a little easier to keep your transactions private and untraceable if they are spread out among several wallets.  If you put all of your coins in the same wallet and you care about staying anonymous, you've basically made it so that compromising your identity on one transaction will compromise it for **all** transactions involved with that address.  Also, you've created an "all your eggs in one basket" honeypot.  If somehow that address is compromised or lost, all is lost.
On the flipside, maintaining several addresses and all of the passcodes associated with them is a management nightmare.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:36:57
Assuming you don't have any holds on your account (due to an ACH or wire transfer not being fully cleared, takes about 4-5 business days), simply go to the "Transfer Funds" menu, and select "Withdraw from Exchange" -&gt; "BTC".
Your bread wallet has two pages, Send money and Receive Money.  You swipe left/right to navigate between the two.  Get the address from "Receive Money", and type it into the Gemini web form.  Make sure you type it correctly!  (I usually choose to copy and paste the address between devices, although this can be tricky too).
If in doubt, send a small amount first to verify the address.

Has nothing to do with your reason, though.  If insiders knew, they would have sold off a lot more a lot more quickly.

Basically, the community can't agree how to increase the blocksize to handle a higher volume of transactions, which is inevitable as bitcoin starts becoming more popular.
The main argument, from what I've gathered, is that BU scales in realtime but is very risky, while Segwit ~~increases the blocksize by a fixed amount~~ uses the blocks more efficiently, and is far less risky and has had the code peer reviewed by other computer scientists.
Add politics to a technical discussion, and you have greedy miners that would seem more incentivized to go towards BU, but not for the good of bitcoin, but for their own bottom line.  They mine empty blocks, which increases transaction fees and creates more unconfirmed transactions, thus exaggerating the problem.
I'm not sure where China fits in, other than they have cheap electricity, and as such, most of the hash power.

Those two charts are totally incomparable.  That bubble in 2000 came from Enron cooking its books, then paying out all of their execs hundreds of millions at the expense of shareholder.  The stock crash in that year is (imo) why the US let the 9/11 attacks happen, and subsequently our invasion of the middle east.  
Enron, the huge energy company couldn't keep forcing brownouts in CA and cooking their books to make free money, so all of those that divested did everything they could to get us in the Middle East, and have a reason to hike gasoline prices by double for a decade while they worked on stealing new energy.

Centralized authority causes most of the problems that exist with the normal banking model, and are the reasons why bitcoin was created in the first place.  If all of the decision making power lays with a small, select, few, then they will undoubtedly change bitcoin in ways that make them more wealthy, rather than in ways that are good solely for bitcoin.

Splits in ideology happen all the time - Look at religion, they've all forked plenty of times and they still survive.  
One of the forks will likely die off in the future, and people will come back to the surviving fork.
You're telling me that if bitcoin forks, you will just give up on crypto?  
At the very least, I find your confident pessimism naive.  I won't say that *without a doubt* crypto would survive, even though I believe it would.  Even if you will give up on crypto, it only fails if everyone does.  I think it's silly that you're speaking for everyone just because you would lose faith.

Basically, if it happens (it wont), you would sell your coins off of the chain you no longer support and buy into the chain you do support.  From an end user standpoint, everything is the same in terms of the coin address.  You just now have to manage it on two blockchains (two different groups of miners validating the "same" address's transaction).  So, you sell the BU coins to a BU coin buyer (I'm assuming you'll use a different wallet, one that runs the fake BU protocol), buy back real Bitcoin and then go on with your merry life.

Buy in person with cash on localbitcoins.com, or using a cash deposit to a seller's bank account.  Very safe, and low risk, provided you meet in a public place like a cafe for the in-person transaction or use a seller with high volume and feedback rating for the cash deposit.
Either way you're paying between 5-15% commission (on the smaller side for cash deposit), but a small price to pay for anonymity and access to a market you otherwise couldn't get in.

It was all over the sub, I'm not going to do a reverse search, it's a pain in the ass on reddit.   However, you can do some Googling to find the information you're after. 
Here's one article I found:
 I did have my facts a little crossed, but only in details.
1) PBoC posts on their website that they will be meeting with Exchange operators to discuss compliance.  Price immediately crashes and a couple days later the PBoC issued another warning, this time about the price volatility of bitcoin (volatility they caused with their first announcement!). Basically the Jan5 bubble was a bunch of margin trading allowed on the two largest exchanges without getting regulatory compliance from the Chinese government.  Immediately after they did the inspections, they forced margin trading to end on Chinese exchanges, hence why the bitcoin trading volume went from looking like a 95% dominated Chinese market to what it is today.  Look at this chart and you'll see what clamping down on these margin trading exchanges did to the trading volume.  Look at today's volume - Miniscule compared to in January but the prices are nearly the same.
Edit: Hint-  OKCoin, Huobi, and btcchina are all chinese exchanges, and make up all of the volume prior to January.
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:55:29
If you're talking peak to valley, then yes.  I'm talking more about the settle shortly thereafter.  January 5th crash went from 1200 to mid 700s, but settled back out to the "normal" support at high 800s days after.  
For adept traders, they might be able to buy that lower dip, but us average Joe's will end up buying somewhere closer to 900.  Of course, it's all just speculation :).

I'm not really sure if you totally answered the question as I was asking.  I'm asking if you would give up on pursuing crypto altogether, not asking if your immediate investment strategies would need to change.
Also, you say you would "never invest long-term into anything that is subject to political coercion".  Guess what, any value that belongs to you that is held by an asset that isn't bitcoin technically is an investment in something subject to political coercion.  
If you give up on crypto, you're forever investing in fiat and all of the politics involved.  You're saying if bitcoin forks you'll never invest in it because it's subject to  political coercion, but all of the alternatives would still be worse using the same criteria.

This is just what I can live with..  I know I have other sins that I will have to tackle, but I still have a lot of life left to figure those out.  
I'm gluttonous, which will harm my health in the long run and is already starting to.  I can live with it right now, but I think about it frequently.
I continuously lust for cuter, younger, women than my partner, but I've never acted upon it.  I've got this one under control, but I still wish I didn't have the feelings.
I could go on and on with things that are wrong with me, but as long as I continue to make progress I think I'm doing okay.  
I used to do things for self gain when I was younger that either hurt others emotionally or in other ways, but I realized I couldn't live with that version of me.  So, I try to limit my sin to myself for now, with hopes that I can abandon the things I need to when I get older. 
 I don't believe sin is inherently bad - Some sin I think is good and is important to experience, because hey, we're alive.  Excess sin and sin directly harming others is where I see things start to cross into the realm of bad quickly.

Use Gemini.  Whole verification process took me a single day.  A bank wire / ACH transfer won't clear fully for 5 days, but it doesn't matter - They credit the coin to your account immediately per your request so you can start trading with it immediately.  You can't withdraw until your funds clear, but at least you aren't missing out on that great price action as the coin gains value.
Also, cash deposit on localbitcoins works well.  Just find a seller with high volume and feedback!

Which is why I sold right before the ETF decision was made (the investment was doing well, near an ATH), and am now buying back in now that the market has returned to the 2 year historical trend line (but seems like it is really low for the short term).
edit: I'm not saying going for altcoins is a foolish investment decision - You are absolutely right they are doing well right now.  That being said, I see them as far more risky than bitcoin since they aren't as well established.  And, if bitcoin rebounds, you might start seeing that new capital leave the altcoins, and see a few of them settle to dust.

I don't have wallstreet or FEC experience, but I work as a project manager in a regulated industry that requires filings with the state.  At least in our case, we wouldn't withdraw. 
 If you heard that it's better to withdraw rather than be rejected, do you remember any reasons they gave as why?  I'm in agreement that a rejection would be more beneficial because then they could file a new ETF with a better path towards compliance...

Even if there was a fork, which there won't be, it wouldn't be  the "final nail in Bitcoin's coffin", imo.  The price would temporarily take a hit, but would come back in time.  If they make rule changes that gives miners unhealthy amounts of power, ultimately the miners will take advantage of it, and kill whatever new bitcoin fork they make.  People will always tend towards the thing that provides them the best service and keeps their interests at heart.

 Localbitcoins.com can mean getting bitcoins in less than an hour if you are close to an appropriate bank and choose the cash deposit option.  These options mean paying a premium for commission.
The best way to get coins instantly is through an exchange.  However, unless you've previously registered and been verified by an exchange, the process to get setup can take 1-3 business days.  Once you're setup, you can buy and sell instantly for minimal fees.

I believe so.  Unless your wallet says that you are running BU, it seems like it would automatically try to send a transaction on the core blockchain.  Some exchanges have already acknowledged that if there is a hard fork they will list the BU as an altcoin.

The only reason the yuan jumped is because the Chinese interfered and manipulated.  Manipulating their currency gives them short-term gains, but only because they are selling their foreign reserves to make it "look" like the yuan is better than it is against other currencies.  In the end, the market will do what it will do, and especially if China depletes its foreign reserves it's just a matter of time before the yuan shows it's true colors.
People keep speculating that China will make bitcoin trading illegal as a last resort to stop capital outflow, but I don't think making it illegal would totally stop BTC in China anyway.  One of the great things about btc is it's hard to regulate.

Do a cash trade on localbitcoins, you won't be scammed.  You pay a commission, so these people are making money, meaning they don't have a reason to scam you.  Plus, the localbitcoins site shows you whether they've funded the transaction, and when you go to meet up with them you'll have a passphrase that they can only see once they've paid out.  I promise you, it is very safe - just meet in a public place.
OR you can do a cash deposit on localbitcoins.  As long as you pick someone with 100% feedback and a high volume of transactions, you know you're fine.  Just follow their instructions closely.

When buying in person for cash, its not technically a real escrow, but it us close enough.  The seller "funds" the transaction prior to the meet up, which is similar to escrow.  Prior to the meetup, the buyer is given A secret passcode, which the seller cannot see until they release the coin.  Acts as a way to be sure the seller follows thru and means you dont need to wait for confirmations.
Just remember, if you buy on an exchange for market value and then sell on lbc, those coins could be followed back to your identity which opens you up to potential taxman scrutiny down the road.  I don't think its an issue now, but the FBI did just try to subpoena coinbase for all of their customer data

How much are you up over what you bought at?  If it is truly your money, it's not her place to give you an ultimatum.  I would turn the ultimatum around on her - Tell her it's not you choosing bitcoin or her, tell her she either needs to be okay with you investing your money how you see fit or she needs to take a hike.
My girl was a little upset about the crash because I'm doing the exact same thing, but I told her when it was above 1k that it was inevitable that it would crash below again.  She suggested I sell at 1100 (which was a really good idea, of course), but I told her we were Hodlers, not traders, and that we were in it for the several year investment.  She has stayed on board despite the crash, but mainly because I was careful with her expectations.

Love, certainty, confidence.  LCC
edit:  I only saw now that you answered your own question in the post.  I came up with a different last word but they mean the same :)
To directly answer your question - because the people who dropped out of the market weren't hodlers.  They were in it for the short term day trading, and now they're afraid that PBoC is going to be tracking their financial movements with intent to persecute if they're not paying tax or if they're launderers.  FUD wouldn't be such an epic crash if the hedge investors were the only ones leaving the market.  LCB brings the market up slowly because there are barriers to entry for a new user to get involved; the hodlers already in the market can only invest so much.

Sending letters isn't fair, back in the real days if you wanted to tell someone something, you went through the damn effort to tell them to their face!  Then they come up with "sending letters"...  have someone else go through all the trouble of delivering your words instead of showing your genuine intent and delivery them yourself..  It's prostitution!

Do some calculations.  Figure out the entire price of the apartment, with all of the utilities and fees included.  Compare that to how much you'd pay to keep a student room (remember that if you have it on loan to include the interest for a 5-10 year student loan payback), and determine how much money you'd be saving by getting the apartment.
IF getting the apartment saves you money, sell your btc and get the apartment.  THEN, use the calculated money you'd save to buy back small amounts of bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-01-24 11:54:15
People lose their pass phrases to get into their wallets, send to dead addresses, lose their physical backups of their wallets.  The bitcoins don't technically disappear but they are effectively removed from circulation forever.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:54:33
Remember that localbitcoins is other people, not a centralized authority.  They need you to use a real ip and need to know what branch to protect themselves from scammers.  If you're that worried, use public wifi and go to a bank that isn't in your town.  Its not like the localbitcoins seller can access the bank's camera feed.  What are you afraid of?
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:20:35
I won't comment on all of OPs points, but I would agree that supply will be decreased because of this.  Even though the bitcoins still exist, the fact that they are removed from circulation will mean a "decreased supply", since a buyer has no way to purchase them.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:46:39
My opinion is that face to face is king of anonymity - provided the person you're buying from also wants to stay anonymous (isn't trying to make your identity known). I haven't used the major exchanges, but I have heard that many require you to identify yourself.   You can tumble the coins to hide where they *go*, but if a government entity forces a site to disclose purchases they will know without a doubt that you bought it.  
Again, I've never used the exchanges, so I could be totally off-base here.  Can anyone else confirm or deny this?

By this argument, God is in agreement with every church's teachings, including Synagogue and Mosque.  If you claim that he knew his church would teach his doctrine correctly on day 0, then God is wrong because there are several religions and even more sects within those religions.  Many of these religions came from the same initial religion that split when there were differences in theology.  I go back to saying everyone can't be right.
If OP claims that God knows that his doctrine is being taught correctly by OP's sect of Catholicism, and every other sect of Catholicism makes the same claim, and every other sect of Christianity and each sect within those sects claim the same thing,  and every other type of religion and various sects claim the same thing, who is right?
I think by lack of consensus, this implies they are ALL wrong.  If God were truly all-knowing, he would have secured his doctrine with blockchain, so it wouldn't be able to vary ;)

@_date: 2017-01-24 17:56:36
Maybe he's calling them spam because at this point everyone knows the transactions are taking a long time, and because nobody in can do anything about it.  "Move along people, we know shit's slow, we don't gotta fill up the sub with every person's transactional woes."
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:26:48
Then I recommend an in person trade.  They might be more willing to deal with an anonymous IP since they have the security of meeting in person.  But again, you are still essentially anonymous.  The only person requesting to know your ip and what town you deposited is the seller, and those two things aren't going to identify you if you take the precautions I listed above.
You're never truly anonymous to everyone in a two party transaction.  Even the people who have the most to lose from not being anonymous still have to deal with the second party.  Picture a drug dealer; they want to stay anonymous so they deal in cash but they still have to meet face to face with the person they're buying or selling from...
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:42:01
localbitcoins.com if you want to buy from another person, or you can go to an exchange to purchase.  In general, buying in person will cost you more for a commission fee, but is a better way to protect your anonymity.

I'm pretty sure the exchange ate it up.  Before any coins were released to people's wallets, I saw tons of buy/sell orders start going through, but for a very specific amount.  I have to imagine it was the exchange doing some go-live verification..
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:56:06
Most likely termed as such because if you lose your wallet, your "cash" aka bitcoin is gone.  There are other ways to lose your money besides losing your wallet, like forgetting your passphrase (the equivalent would be if you all of the sudden could not figure out how to work that complex piece of leather).

Still nothing to shake your finger at, but I'm pretty sure the exchange got it.  I was watching the order book right when it started and all of the sell orders were for very controlled amounts.  Seemed like Kraken was testing the waters of their trading engine before releasing BCH into the publics' accounts.

In our current world, fees would go way up. However, this will be far in the future and the hope would be that the cost associated with mining would go way down, due to better, more efficient hardware and cheaper energy.  Assuming energy generation becomes cheap, the current fee structure might be sufficient to make mining profitable without a reward

I think you can put buy orders in ahead of time.  Until the BCH is actually released into people's accounts, there isn't a sell order to match it with, so they just sit there waiting.  As soon as it drops, someone will eat up that order and get 3.301 bitcoin for .001 shitcoins.

Bitcoin's history, and my hunch that Ver is just doing a pump and dump.  Many bitcoin hodlers don't watch the news or even price each day.  Half of them don't even know that bch exists, so they won't dump their coin out of fear.  Half of them might never even know they own BCH, and if they find out it's now worth 800 bucks, they're going to see it as free money and sell it.  Selling of BCH will bring the price back down.  Oh look, it's already gone down over 100 bucks.

Find a seller near you and buy in person or find a bitcoin ATM for approx 7-10% above price.
You pay for anonymity, but it's worth it imo.  You can also do a Cash deposit into a bank account on localbitcoins.com for about 5% commission.  Localbitcoins is sort of like craigslist and ebay mixed.

If that were the case, then a religious figure would be a heretic for teaching that the world isn't flat.  I still can't understand how a group of people could believe that teachings can't be updated as the world is updated.  
Even if God revealed our doctrine, he didn't write it down.  It was written down by human minds that existed in far more primitive times.  If the human mind couldn't accurately UNDERSTAND God's doctrine, much like they couldn't understand how the world could be anything but flat, how can the expectation be that they interpreted his word correctly?
Even religion has to evolve.  Of course, that's just my opinion.

Well, on localbitcoins you could do an in person cash trade if you like.  The seller "funds" the transaction, and then releases the coin as soon as you pay him.  He reads back a security code that he can only know if her released the coins.  Could be paying like 10% commission for something like that.  Another option is to do a cash deposit into the seller's bank account. You pay less commission for that and rely on the seller's feedback rating to judge them as trustworthy.

The market will never just sit at a price for a week and say "this is as low as I'll be, go ahead and buy".  It's always speculation, but my advice is to buy before the price starts going up again.
You might buy now and then find it drops another $100 and say, "man I shouldn't have bought yet".  So what?  It will go up again and you'll probably make money either way.  The worse choice is to wait too long, and then find it climbs back to $1000 never to drop below again.  Then you'll be saying, "man, I wish I bought at ANY point below $1000"
It's all feelz in the end, go with your gut and don't get too greedy.

Which is why i said to use a different persons IP address.  Or use a tumbler then.  Also, bitcoin is well known not to be anonymous.  Its pseudo anonymous.  My opinion is that even if someone went through the trouble of tracking all of my address transfers and IP/mac address combos they can't truly say where that offline address truly resides.
There are ways to do what you're saying, it's just being a little overkill.  You could buy a device anonymously that you only use for your bitcoin activity, and only use public internet and you would have all of the anonymity you are requesting.  A lot of extra work? Sure, but that's the price you pay for anonymity that is more than necessary for the avg user.

It depends on how you choose to think.  It's not like he invested their money, he invested his money.
I don't think keeping a few important secrets are overall wrong in a spousal relationship, especially if they are both benefiting from his money management.
If he were to only spend those coins on things for HIM, then it might be wrong, but I view this as doing what's best for his family by continuing to be the money manager.  And in this case, that could mean keeping them secret.

You said it first.


We migrated a system with tens of millions of dollars onto the cloud in less than a year.  From what you're saying, this isn't a migration or hardware issue - It's a coding issue.  Writing and implementing new code is much more cut and dry than migrating a production service.  Most medium-large institutions have production releases every single month with improvements.  I'd have to imagine a multibillion dollar institution has even more money to spend on project management and coding and can do so at least monthly.

Anyone know the details?  They mention volume over 20k dollars but what does that mean?  20k in a single trade?  20k over all trades? or withdrawals more than 20k?
It doesn't make sense that they should be able to subpoena for 20k in trades, since you haven't actually realized any value according to the tax law until you convert to actual fiat AKA cash withdrawals..

Price and volume are two different concepts.  You don't need be able to predict the price to know that you need your AWS instances to be ready to scale to large fluxuations in web volume.  It's a matter of making sure your service contract with Amazon or whoever hosts you will include allocating huge amounts of resources when your site needs it the most.  As a huge company with plenty of money, this is a no-brainer.
The whole benefit of cloud computing is the ability to allocate more hardware on a dime without actually physically plugging that hardware into your instance in a predictive fashion.

3)  Your new statement has some context, but still doesn't provide any content that a person should believe.  I use a bitcoin exchange - That could easily be construed as "I've worked on financial platforms that manage billions" if you consider trading working.

I think many would argue that Assumption 1 isn't necessarily true.  I believe bitcoin has value because it can store value and be resilient to geopolitical strife.  I can store my value in bitcoin, and if my local currency crashes, or if I want to cross borders without paying huge conversion fees, my bitcoin is totally suitable.
There is certainly the benefit that I CAN use my bitcoin as a currency, but I don't think that's why so many find it attractive.

Well, we know we reached a critical mass in December - But, there are several scaling solutions that the largest exchanges (such as Coinbase) had been dragging their feet on.  We also believe that miners were purposefully spamming the network with high-fee transactions to try to get users to move to Bitcoin Cash.
We also have the Lightning Network just coming out of test.  Point is, the technology is very far from no longer making progress to increase efficiency and user space.  
We may see a mass exodus of users after this crash.  I think we are still very far from seeing the true critical mass of bitcoin because both user acceptance and price are severely volatile.  They are valid criticisms, but I think people who claim this is the end are a little naive and too wrapped up in fear.  No one should be expecting to earn massive returns - the expectation is what causes a bubble.  Early adopters will get what is coming to them in the long run, but those are truly the people that believe in it's potential to change the world, not it's potential to make them rich quick.

Eventually, Bitcoin will stop earning a return.  I think you'll see a "critical mass" of users where the currency keeps a steady value, much like any other currency.  at that point, any overflow users will start using a different crypto.  These are all very difficult concepts to work out long term because it's difficult to know where the world will go, but I do think there is plenty of space in the global financial market for crypto to be sustainable.

Right, but he is trying to indicate that a bounce is imminent.  I would agree.  I won't say it would reclaim the ATH;  but the point I was making was that this bear market could very well extend back down to 1k-2k, but I think it will hit 15k before then.
I agree with you that it could very well be like last time, but due to how fast it has happened, it would require many elastic rebounds to happen.  And in those rebounds, you can make money if you enter and exit right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:20
I disagree.  There are many cases where you would be fine with only converting in and out of bitcoin.  My second point was that because it is a global commodity, it has value no matter which country you visit.  
For instance, I know someone who lives in USA, but works in Iceland.  He flies out of Canada because he can get a cheaper direct flight.
Over the course of a month, he visits three countries regularly.  Rather than keeping loads of cash in each fiat currency, or paying huge conversion fees, he just carries bitcoin, and does local sells for the fiat currency as he needs it.
Same as people hold gold to store value-  They aren't planning on making that gold into Jewelry or directly spend that gold, but they still hold it as an investment because it is globally accepted as a standard.

There are also fees for the service.  The algorithm will continue releasing bitcoins for over a hundred years, and I think the expectation by then is that something drastic changes that keeps bitcoin viable.  (such as super cheap electricity, or enough efficiency and use where the fees are sufficient to keep miners incentivized while not being too much for the users).  Also, the amount of hashrate to keep the network going doesn't need to be as high as it is, but it adds security.  If mining isn't profitable, miners will stop, the difficulty level (can sort of be thought of as the target hashrate to find the next block) will adjust meaning a miner consuming less power, therefor cheaper operating costs, can find the next block.

Certain things will happen with any chart.  I'm not saying you can time it perfectly, but if you were to buy right now, it is just about guaranteed that the price will rebound at least to 11k before going too far back down.  Market movements share similar properties of energy.  Too much up, a hard slam down (what we're experiencing).  That first shot down, if too fast, will sling back up.
You don't need to be a time traveler, you just need to not invest more than you can afford to lose, and therefor, not care.  Then you just make sure you sell when it is more.

1) I said it has value because it can *store* value in a manner that can be trusted, since the rules are agreed upon by every node connected to the network.  I can't stop the US government from printing more dollar bills, but I know exactly how many bitcoins there will ever be.  
2) It is globally used - The Venezuelan Bolivar's can crash without affecting bitcoin.  India can remove it's largest bills from circulation and screw things up without affecting bitcoin.  China can sell massive stores of USD to prop up the Yuan without affecting bitcoin.

You keep indicating that I'm in denial or claiming that this will absolutely rebound.  I am merely stating facts about what has happened in the past.  I don't know whether this will definitely be the one that pops or whether it will definitely rebound.  I'm simply stating that people post that graph every correction, and have been wrong more times than right.
Other dips are usually between 40 and 50%.  Yes, this dip is larger than those.  Does that mean it guarantees no recovery? I'd say no.  You're spouting off like you can guarantee without a doubt what will happen, and I'm the only one of us that is admitting no one has any clue what will happen.
Maybe you're in denial?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:42:03
Don't sell the dip, only buy the dip.  You've locked in your $10,000 buy.  Don't sell that bitcoin until the price is above $10,000.
However, if you buy the dip, you increase your holding but your average price per coin goes down.  If you buy the same amount at $7,000, now your average price per coin is $8,500.  
If you did this, you could now sell all of it when it goes above $8,500 instead of $10,000.  Or if you go long, you make even more money the higher it goes.

I am included in the group that thinks you should not use Coinbase, but it would be hypocritical for someone to tell you not to use Coinbase on a political grounds without you first doing your own research and forming your own opinion.  People should not push their ideals down the throats of others, they should gently offer to feed them with respect.

Gemini is my favorite exchange.  There you can purchase bitcoins, but until you move it to a wallet software in your control, such as bitcoin core, you do not actually fully own the coins, they are just an IOU!
Best practice is to move coins to your own wallet for safe-keeping, and then put into "cold storage", or a wallet that is completely disconnected from the Internet for long term holdings.  
The sidebar on the right has a lot of great information to get started.  Welcome to bitcoin!

Gemini gives you instant credit for your trades - You can make a trade as soon as you initiate the transfer.  You just can't withdraw until that money clears.  
I would change to Gemini and give up on credit card purchases because they really don't afford you anything other than the ability to immediately withdraw your money again.  (which, if you're buying coin to make money, in most cases you have to wait for that money to be worth more anyway)
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:21:19

We're down to 50% below ATH one month after.  How can this last for two years?  Unless it goes back up first, then back down.  
No matter what, it has to go back up in the short term to follow a similar trend.  The question you need to ask yourself is, when it approaches the ATH, will it pass it again?
There are a lot of positive developments in bitcoin.  I personally think with the amount of people that were waiting to get verified, and with the LN and Segwit implementations, we will easily pass the ATH again on the next upswing.

This.  The 13% of people who have filed thus far probably have a very simple tax reporting process.

Are you being sarcastic?
The very definition of whether it follows the chart or rebounds is what defines it as a bubble that popped.
The last 5 corrections people were posting these.  Those corrections rebounded instead of kept going down, so by definition they were labeled corrections rather than bubbles.  So yes, every bubble follows this chart. However, not every correction is a bubble popping.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:08:34
Then register on an exchange, withdraw to your bank account, and get ready for the scrutiny from the tax man.  There is no magic solution.  You can put up to 10k cash down on a vehicle without them being forced to report it, although they can choose to if they want.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:13:57
So the bottom, based upon that chart will be found in a couple months time before returning to "the mean".  
What this guy doesn't care to mention, is that a "return to the mean" is essentially a reset.  There is no reason the asset cannot again take off or even bubble again.  Look at the housing bubble - We're already at the peak again.

Yes and no.  The majority of the Internet's servers are located in the United States and 70% of Internet traffic goes through Virginia.  The changes as they stand won't directly affect you but the setup a framework that could very well affect you.  Regardless, IF (a big if because I wholeheartedly agree with your second statement that net neutrality won't affect bitcoin) would you really want a chunk of the bitcoin market as large as the USA to leave?  You should care about net neutrality in the United States because believe it or not, the USA still sways other countries and if net neutrality goes out here, how long until your Internet is gone too?

It doesn't matter what amounts you are playing with.  The difficulty is predicting what will happen.  Lets say you sell at 8k planning to buy back at 7k, but it instead goes up to 9k.  Do you buy at 9k?  do you keep waiting?  what if it goes up to 10k?

They announce they will give users bcash in 2018, well after the next fork.  Will they always be a fork behind?  When will they give you the result of the coming fork, 2019?

Tell him to try to buy drugs with a tulip.  Or hide all of his tulips on a computer chip smaller than his thumb (or just in his brain for that matter).  Tell him to go to another country and haul all his tulips over there without anyone knowing he has them.  Tell him to ensure that no one will grow a single tulip that he and all other tulip owners won't know about.  Also tell him to just forget about the Internet and all of the other technology that would have prevented tulip mania from being a thing if they existed back then.

It's all relative to when a person gets in the market.  If you don't currently own bitcoin, the current price doesn't matter.
Once you buy bitcoin, which direction the price goes starts to matter.  If it goes down from where you bought at, you will be losing money.  If it goes up, you will be gaining money.
Take a look at the historical price chart if you're curious about how bitcoin has performed in the history.
past performance doesn't guarantee anything in the future, but it's all you have to work off of at this point in time.

Buy less of bitcoin with the same amount of money when the price is high.  When the price is low, buy more bitcoin for the same amount of money.
There's no easy answer on whether or not to invest in something.  Price at any given time is relative - You'll likely never see $220 coins again so you have to ask yourself a simple question.  Will the price of bitcoin go higher than $2700?

It means, if you keep track of the average price you *paid* for bitcoin, you will always win if you do the following:
Buy items with your bitcoin while the current price is higher than your average price (you'll be buying things at a discount since you invested less money for the same amount of buying power).
Buy bitcoin while the current price is lower than your average price, since it is an opportunity to get cheap coins.
If you are just planning on holding as an investment and not buying anything with your bitcoin, it doesn't really apply to you.

Buy a 4 pack of USB flash drives from amazon for 20 bucks, encrypt and backup your wallet.dat file from your private wallet (need to transfer to a wallet from the exchange in order to do this), and put the file on each of the USB drives.
Make the wallet.dat files "hidden", and pop a few pictures or something else on the drives.
Store your drives in several *separate* locations - Never the same building in case it burns down - Maybe one at your house, one in your car, one at a loved one's, one at work.  Wherever you feel most comfortable.  It's good to hide them.
Store your recovery seed (from when you encrypted) in several locations, but never the same location as your USB  drives.  Ideally, memorize this seed.

I've actually seen an uptick in news articles of recently, and personally attribute a part of the price raise due to that.
I think it's good there isn't more news. Increased adoption is definitely a good thing, but when the price increases this much over such a short period of time, it isn't good for bitcoin in the long run.  If it bubbles and then bursts, it will scare a lot of new people away.

It reduces supply.  Less supply, more demand, higher price.
Currently it is probably insignificant - I doubt more than 100,000 or 200,000 coins have been lost out of the eventual 21 million, but that number will increase over time.
Think of it as that limited edition collector's item - over time, they gain in value and one of the reasons is people lose or wreck some of the original supply.

Markets rely on human psychology.  If something only goes up, the 1st time it goes down people will have no confidence in it's ability to hold support.  
If something climbs for 28 days straight, then declines on day 29, how do you have any concept of how long that decline will be or how low it will go?  You can't, because it's never happened before.
If something climbs overall for 28 days, but has a pullback every three days, but always manages to survive the pullback and make gains afterwards, it builds a lot more confidence.
This is a very simplified way to explain this phenomenon, but the principal is the same.  Investors rely on bearish pullbacks to validate the market truly is as strong as the bulls say it is.

It is natural market tendency.  If you look at the 1 or 2 year chart, you can see a clear ~~line~~ curve of support.

Whether or not you run a node is unimportant (for your coins - I would never want to discourage anyone from running a node).
What is important is that you are prepared to act if the fork happens.  You will want a wallet that supports BIP148.  You will own coins on two chains, so you will have to maintain your balance on both chains.  
Ideally, you dump the coins off of the chain you no longer support, and transfer their value to the chain you do support.  After doing this, you will own coins on a single chain once again, and won't have to worry about it going forward.
For those that are unsure who they support, they can continue owning coins on both chains until they see a clear "winner".

I like your perspective.  It's funny because I want to get enough coins to be able to easily afford a Tesla with only part of what I cash out, but not because I think I need a cool car - I want a car that doesn't consume gasoline, because the gasoline economy is one of those things that I feel is putting the world in slavery, similar to banks.
I could certainly go out and buy a cheaper electric car, but I think Elon Musk's ideas are going to save our world and I want to support that.  Same as I want to support the end of banking.  So I'm in a conundrum and I know it will take a lot more bitcoin for me at a lot higher price before I can justify doing it.

Yeah.  I'm no expert on margin trading, but if there are a bunch of margin orders and the price starts going against a bunch of margin traders' bets, a whale can trigger a flurry of orders that send the price catapulting up or down since the margin trader won't have enough capital to cover their bet.

Pretty much - Only subtlety, you will have value on both chains, so to retain your full bitcoin value, you'll want to sell of off (or spend) the coins off of the chain you don't support, or the chain that eventually "fails".  
If one chain starts increasing in value quickly because the demand is higher, people will start selling their coins off of the losing chain.  No matter what, this will be bad for the overall bitcoin price in the short term (there will be people left holding the bag with the losing coin), but will solve the scaling solution for the near future and will (hopefully) increase interest overall. 
By picking a chain early, you are essentially voting for the winner, securing your overall value if you are correct, but risking picking the wrong chain which will remove some of your overall value if you are incorrect.

Nothing, but -&gt; Something only gets value if people give it value.
There are already over 700 cryptocurrencies out there..
So, if that's true, why hasn't bitcoin plunged?  Because people choose bitcoin because other people choose bitcoin.
People will only be interested in using a different currency if it has attributes that differ from the already popular currency.
Eventually, if the price to use bitcoin becomes too much because it is too crowded, people will start using other cryptocurrencies that have cheaper operating costs.  They will still only gravitate towards the cryptos other people are using, though, because other people won't want to trade a currency that no one else uses. It's like printing your own "Coffeeandskiing bucks".  They only have value if other people want to use them.

Wow, really? Do some searching of your own, you have access to Google too.
On a personal note, I live in the state with the least amount of gun control laws, and we have the lowest rate of violent crime.  No one tries to do a home invasion here because it's guaranteed that most the households have a weapon.  Criminals become less willing to perform violent crimes if they know that the good guys have the ability to defend themselves.
Edit:  More importantly, whether or not you agree with gun control is irrelevant.  I literally used the exact same argument as you and you're complaining because you don't like how I used it.  You can't claim that making something illegal won't decrease the amount that criminals use it because they break laws and then in the same breath say that the same isn't a good argument for another similar law.

What I was saying, was that if the price was ALREADY near the mean, a crash couldn't exist, so a return to the mean would be considered a correction.
Take this example -  If the mean price is $1500, and the current price is $1600.  The price moving from 1600 back to 1500 could hardly be considered a crash - It would simply be considered a correction.  Untwist your undies.

China was leading everything about bitcoin until January.  The volume change came from when the Chinese Government disallowed margin trading on the big exchanges.  First they announced they were "cracking down", which caused a price crash.  After they finished their inspections, they announced that Chinese exchanges would no longer allow margin trading.  After this announcement is when the trading volume stopped being so high in China.
Notice the three huge bars that declined, "btcchina", "huobi", and "okcoin", all chinese exchanges.

WannaCry is an insignificant blip on the bitcoin radar.  The interest it generates will make a certain population of people look into "what is this bitcoin thing" and will make a certain population of ignorant people continue thinking bitcoin is just for criminals.
Overall, it will be a wash imo.  There will always be criminal use cases for bitcoin, but the value it affords non-criminals is too great for it to fail -  Similar to cash.

Everyone would need to sell all of their coins.  Might sound like an unhelpful answer, but it's the truth.  The only way for the bottom to fall out is if people were led to believe bitcoin was no longer viable and sold their coins.
While people think it is still viable, there will still be buyers.

It doesn't matter.  A few hundred per coin here or there won't make much of a difference on your bottom line if you're planning on investing for more than a couple of months.
If you're looking to get rich quick by getting in and out of the market in a matter of weeks, you're currently playing a risky game with the 50% gains in a single  month.  A correction is due, but whether it will be today, tomorrow, a week, or a month from now can't be "figured out".

Obviously they're different things.  I was pointing out the similarity of the argument.

This was the price less than a month ago.  People really should not be scared to see something return temporarily to a price point that was there less than 30 days prior.
Remember that a drop to 1500 doesn't mean that's where it will settle. Each bubble and burst has a peak and a valley.  If the peak of the bubble is 2700, and the valley is 1500, the price will likely settle at 2100, and then start its climb again.

Any of these sites offer a "withdraw" option.  You simply withdraw btc by specifying the receiving address.  
If you want the btc transferred to your airbits wallet, you simply provide that wallet's address as the recipient.  
Bear in mind that each transfer costs fees, and that these fees are based upon the size of the transaction data, not the amount of money.  Long story short, make sure you have your receive address correct (I copy paste, and then read the address twice to be sure), and send large amounts when moving to your wallet.  Sending $20 here or there will eat up your bitcoin in fees.  So wait until you have a few hundred dollars in the exchange and send it all at once.

I was kind of put on the spot by the loan originator and I just plain told her that I always keep cash around.  I told her that I like to use craigslist and if the banks aren't open I don't want to wait for them to be able to jump on an advertisement.  She said if that were the case I would need to sign a form saying so - Not sure if they would accept the loan given that excuse with nothing to back it up.
So now I'm just thinking, how is bitcoin buying and selling any different from other assets other than people's misconceptions about it?  It's the same principal, but I have at least some paperwork to back it up.  Plus then I wouldn't be committing forgery by signing something untrue, which I absolutely won't do.

Just don't advertise that you have a ton of bitcoins.  If you take proper cold storage precautions, it should be very difficult to identify that you have bitcoin. 
Also, you can setup faux-wallets.  There's no telling how many actual wallets you have hidden away on a device, so if you pop $100 into a wallet and hide your others, you could just tell a criminal that you legitimately only own 100 bucks in bitcoin.  
The same method can be used to cross borders where TSA or other agents might scrutinize your USB key or hardware wallet.

Resistance will always come in some form.  A big whale in the industry wants to get cheaper coins so they spread FUD on purpose which then leads to a panic sell by investors; A government chooses to announce new regulation that scares people into selling...
I'm not basing my analysis on another market, I'm basing it on bitcoin's history! And don't forget, when it "flash crashes" it's usually over the course of a couple days, not 5 minutes, and it almost always dips lower than the support line briefly.  If my graphical analysis is correct, you could see coins as cheap as $1,100 for a very short period of time before it recovers to the support line. 
Predictions should obviously be taken with a grain of salt, but these "ATH markets" that you speak of were also the case in all of the bubbles I pointed out.  They hit an ATH and then crashed, there is always resistance or the price would be infinity.

Not necessarily.  Each sell order increases downward pressure that scares buyers away.  I'm totally fine if I am unsuccessful at selling it - I just want to indicate my intentions to the market.
On the flip-side, if someone does buy my sell order, they will have bought it for a fraction of a price lower than if my sell order hadn't been there.  Therefor, my sale helps keep the price down in the case where someone buys it as well.

It's not that they "aren't giving out any usd".  You can convert your btc into USD on the exchange, but you cannot REMOVE that USD from the exchange.  You can still remove BTC from the exchange.  So, if you're a trader, why would you keep your money in an exchange that says you can no longer take your USD out?  You wouldn't, you'd rather go to an exchange without these undesirable constraints, but the only way to retrieve your value from the exchange is through BTC.  
As such, any USD you have in that exchange needs to be converted to BTC before you can once again take ownership of your money.  The price is inflated because there is no reason to sell bitcoin on that exchange and a huge reason to buy bitcoin with any money already trapped in your account.

If you're thinking about getting back in the mining game because of the "drastic increases in bitcoin prices", that tells me you want to mine because you want to make money.
Don't bother.  
Buy bitcoin.  This will make you more money than trying to create bitcoin for free.  If you bought a bitcoin 1 month ago and sold it today, you would have made 50% profit on what you originally invested.

You would have needed to have a buy order already set to realize this price.  Trading bots fill the void so quickly now, that "watching" the price would only show you about $2340, when it went below 2200 on several exchanges.

No, but they have to pay tax when spending them or trading them back in for fiat.
It's not uncommon for people to pay +10% on localbitcoins for anonymous cash purchases because people like to protect their anonymity.

The market is constantly going up and down within the larger moves.  If you look at a historical chart, all of those smooth lines in the big transitions were actually filled with several back and forth moves over several hundred dollars.
This is not the bottom.  The bottom will be realized in 2-4 days, most likely.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:53:49
Because bitcoin's primary use case is similar to that of gold.
No one is going to be buying coffee with such a high tx fee, but if you've got $3,000 that you want to gain interest, spending a few dollars to turn that into bitcoin is far more worth than putting it in the bank where it will make a stagnant .05% annual interest.

You'll need to drop it into the correct folder for the filesystem. 
At least for bitcoin core, that wallet.dat file on a Windows machine goes in:
C:/Users/[username]/AppData(hidden folder)/Roaming/Bitcoin
Not sure which folder Electrum uses or how to drop it into other types of OS', but I imagine it is similar.  
Then you fire the application back up, it takes a while to rescan, then you should have access to the wallet (assuming you didn't encrypt it as u/thatsadoormat pointed out).

The problem is that people's rights can collide with each other, meaning there will always be some limitation to your entitlements because we live in a society.

This would be easier, I think, because I could show that I owned the coins right from the start, and then show that they were sold on a registered exchange.  The part that I think will be difficult is the cash sale part.  I can prove I bought them from an AML/KYC registered exchange, I just don't know who I sold them to.

I was a little chuffed as well - But, you only have to do the wire once.  After that, your bank will be supported by regular ACH.

As a follow-up, if the money hit your account FROM Gemini, simply showing the paper trail should work since it is an account to account wire.  The loan officer told me mine was no good specifically because it was a cash deposit, and there was no way to prove exactly where it came from
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:22:39
Supply and Demand. 
There isn't any other answer besides that.  People get scared to lose money, and sell off their coins, creating greater supply and less demand.  
People get confident and don't want to miss out on "free" money, they buy coins, increasing demand and decreasing supply. 
There isn't anything other than buyers and sellers changing the price.

This argument is nonsensical.  Have you ever heard of "limited edition" anything?  The fact that it is limited gives it value.  Why would I want something else that can be infinite when I can get the thing every one else wants that has a finite number?


Bitcoin is currently based upon speculation because it is new.  When fiat currency was first introduced, people had to "speculate" that it would hold its value. Now, because it is so widely used and used as the basis for most things, it is a more stable asset.  But that doesn't give it any more intrinsic value than bitcoin, because at the end of the day, they were both speculative ideas of how to transfer value between people without trading physical goods.

Until the issue with scaling is worked out, the best use case isn't really as an everyday currency.
There are definitely people that use it as such, but due to high fees it isn't really appropriate for small purchases.
It's biggest use case is similar to that of gold, to store larger value over long periods of time.  In that way, it is definitely more used as an investment vehicle today than as a currency.
Get some scaling solutions that bring fees down, that can all change.

I will certainly update this thread in the future, whichever way the cards fall.  I'm hoping my paper trail will be sufficient even though it involves unidentifiable parties.  
As you say, what would the difference be if I sold any other asset for cash but did not produce a signed bill of sale?  Maybe the answer is that there isn't any difference.  Ridiculous how serious this war on cash has gotten.

If you know how to navigate a file structure, you can do this :).
"Encrypting/backing up" your wallet.dat file are menu items within your wallet software (such as Bitcoin Core).
Plopping it in and out of your USB drives is just looking up the file location on google, and then navigating using windows explorer.
Making it hidden is simply right-clicking the file, clicking "Properties", and then checking the "Hidden" checkbox.
I promise you it is very easy :).  The hard part is choosing where to hide them!

Hardware, and don't bother.  There are warehouses in China who's sole purpose is to mine bitcoins.  Their hardware is optimized, their power is super cheap, they get pretty much all of the coins.
It isn't really cost-effective for anyone else to mine anymore.

When you make a trade on an exchange, they aren't physically moving money to the wallet on the blockchain.
They credit your Gemini account, which acts as an IOU - It isn't until you withdraw that money as btc that they actually send money over the blockchain.
For many people, they withdraw as USD, so Gemini doesn't pay any fee except for the large bulk purchases they make to cover volume.  If you withdraw as btc, they're expecting they'll make enough money from trades to cover these fees.

I was just reading this article.  I remember reading it when it came out in January and decided to search for it again 20 minutes ago.
Funny you're thinking the same thing!  I will say that the other EWT articles that I read from early January placed the bitcoin price at 2,000 around the end of 2017.  Seems that either the wave cycle is going to be shorter, or we're in a temporary bubble.

I've enjoyed Gemini.  I've heard Coinbase is also decent, but they have network strain issues from time to time.  
Not so coincidentally, the times where they have a lot of user activity that strains the network is usually the time where you would see the availability of their service as most important as a trader.

Unfortunately we've already entered a purchase and sales agreement.  Everything I read online says that the lenders are really ensuring that you didn't get your down payment by taking out other debts.  
To this ends, I am considering printing the LBC advertisement and screenshots showing that it was closed.  There won't be a signature from the buyer but at least it will show where the money came from.  I'm hoping that coupled with withdrawals from my accounts to the exchange will prove that I own the money and it has a legitimate source, but I'm still worried they'll decline us.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:53:49

It really doesn't matter which way to store you go if you're investing 10-30 euros and seeing what happens over the course of the week.
If you're investing that amount of money, I would suggest forgetting that value altogether - I.E. put it in cold storage in a hardware wallet or multiple offline USB drives (more than 1 in case you have a hardware failure) and forgetting about it for 5-10 years.
It's really not going to make you rich in the short term for a small amount like that, plus the fees will eat up your profit alone.  Wait until 20 Euros of bitcoin is worth 1000 Euros in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:13:18


I'm not sure if I have this totally right, but I think you need a separate wallet for each chain.  This may be the difference between a hard and soft fork, it would be nice for someone else to weigh in.
As for the waiting it out - Yes, you don't need to do anything at all.  You can wait for the dust to settle.  You can be reactionary in this instance, it won't take long to install the software needed on your machine.
Ideally, and what people are petitioning, is for the major exchanges to provide this support.  In this case, you don't need to worry at all.   If the coin is on the exchange, they'll have the paths in place to maintain the coin correctly.  Those of us that put the coin in cold storage may have to just install a second wallet to facilitate this.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:02:46
I was unable to use any of the bitcoin money for the down payment.  If you can fund your down payment through other legitimate sources (had to get gifts from family members), they can ignore the deposit as it isn't being used for the down payment. Hope it helps!

Use Gemini.  As soon as you are verified you can start buying bitcoin.  Even though the first wire takes 4-5 days to fully confirm, they give you credit on your account so you can start trading immediately.  You just cannot withdraw money from the exchange until that deposit fully clears

If the current sell price is $1.00, I'll likely set my price for $.99.  If someone else sees my $.99 sell order, they'll likely set their price to $.98.  If I don't move my order price down and more people want to sell than want to buy, there is a good chance I'll be unsuccessful unless I keep reducing my sell price.  Setting a price is a necessary part of the equation... It's how markets work...

You've got the gist.  You need to purchase to an exchange, or in person.  Exchanges are safer in terms of not being ripped off, but require more steps to provide identification.
You then make a transaction to yourself from the exchange to your hardware wallet, or storage equivalent.  When it comes time to sell, you do the same process in reverse.

I've thought about this, although they would require a signed gift form from that family member.  They may even ask for that family member's account information where it shows them withdrawing that money from their account.  
At the end of the day, if a family member has $4,000 laying around unaccounted for, why couldn't I just have $4,000 laying around unaccounted for?

Bitcoin has bubbled and corrected several times, the part about it bubbling and correcting is 100% correct.

Transaction fees are based upon the *data* size of the transaction.  It has more to do with how many times the original coin was split in the past.
It has nothing to do with dollar amount.
That being said, if you split the transaction up into mutiples, you will absolutely pay more in fees.
Check out this chart:
If you prepare the transaction in your wallet, it should tell you how big it is (in bytes), so you can determine how much fee you'll want to pay in respect to how quickly you need the transaction to go through.  
1 Satoshi	= 0.00000001 bitcoin

We need them because the current design allows miners to leave non-fee transactions out of the blocks.
The whitepaper was a theoretical analysis of something that had not yet been created.  In practice, you can't send a transaction without a fee because your transaction will never be confirmed.
The reason miners collect fees are because the dwindling block reward can't cover their operational cost to keep the network going.  Whether or not they are collecting too many fees is outside of this debate.  The design allows them to profit, so they try to maximize it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:07:07
Because it prevents the miners that contribute most of the hashrate from making ridiculous sums of money.  Their greed prevents them from going forward with the best, peer-reviewed, scaling proposal.

Exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase are in the business of selling you bitcoins. They make their money off of transaction fees, so they want to keep their reputation.  
They start ripping off their customers, not only will it kill their business model it will set them up for lawsuits.
Buying from another person on a p2p exchange or in person like localbitcoins is slightly more risky, but these mediums usually have an escrow-like service to keep your money safe.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:25:15
On August 2nd, I don't expect to be any wealthier.  However, on August 6th, I expect bitcoin to explode again when a winner is declared.
It is safer to hold your coins through than to transact immediately after.
No matter what, your coins will be good on whichever chain wins.  If you transact immediately after (including trying to buy back in), you risk losing your money.
If you wait until the dust settles, you will be safe to buy back in, but might have missed the bandwagon.  
If you're willing to continue your investment until September or later, just hodl, it's the safest course.

Just want to say that it isn't very nice to make Gemini out to be the bad guys here.  In your post yesterday, several people indicated that it could take up to a month for you to get your money back.  
It took three days for Gemini to correct a mistake you made, maybe don't make Gemini out to be the bad guys?  Especially considering all exchanges are under a heavy support ticket load for new people trying to sign up.
Hell, I've been waiting almost a week for a simple verification from Kraken.

The "blockchain" is a race by miners to write the next block.  A block contains transactions.  
You can have your transaction prioritized by giving a higher fee, because it will contribute to a higher fee reward to the miner who writes the block.
Due to a huge new interest in bitcoin, there is competition among users to have their transaction processed first, which means people are paying higher fees to get their money through before you. 
Since most people use bitcoin like gold, they are sending several thousand dollars, sometimes millions at a time in a single transaction.  To them, $2.50 is a trivial amount to pay to have their transaction go through.

My argument is that bitcoin hasn't lost value due to altcoins, not that there has been zero impact.  For all we know, ETH has helped bitcoin due to increased interest in crypto currency in general

I'm on the Gemini exchange, they don't charge blockchain fees.  They still charge transaction fees, but these are only .25% of the trade amount.  Not sure about others.

Have you only been in bitcoin for three days?  Actually, have you ever been in any market for more than a few days?
Believe it or not, price doesn't always go up.  ETH didn't come around yesterday, it's been there since 2015.

Multiply the amount of btc you would have at the price you bought by the supposed price you would sell.

I think so, but I've been waiting two weeks to be verified! I would suggest signing up for several exchanges at once to minimize the amount of time to get into the market.

I mean, you can "choose" a fork safely.  Many are saying that the battle will only last a few days, if not only a few hours.
If you make your choice after the winner is clear, it is safe.  I'm betting that people won't have time to choose a fork unless they've got a game plan in place and act quickly..

If you think it's just these companies, you're in for a big surprise.  ALL of the exchanges are being "spammed" by people like you. Look at google trends for the interest in searching "bitcoin" for the last month.  It had gone through the roof.  It takes time for companies to meet such demand.  Its not like they hire extra people to sit around on their hands waiting for a huge influx of users, thats would be a dumb way to run a business.  So, now they have to play catchup and determine if they need to hire extra staff for the future or if this is just a temporary increase in interest.  Be patient.  Ive been waiting a week and a half for verification on Kraken.

Does it matter?  Core doesn't control anything, it is up to the users to come to an agreement to change things.  
If nothing happens, don't blame Core.  Bitcoin was *designed* to be really difficult to change so miners (or anyone else, for that matter) can't subvert the rules to improve their bottom line.

So far it appears that people are flocking to another crypto currency but it isn't affecting the value of bitcoin.
And saying ETH has a better algo and technology is laughable.  It's different, and does certain things better, but there are a lot of things that are still better about bitcoin.

Unfortunately, there isn't any quick read.  The technical aspect is only one piece of the puzzle.  A lot of the situation is a political history, and has a lot to do with mistrust of one side or the other.  Even if you agree more with one side technically, you have to think about that side's ultimate intentions.
That's all I'll really say.  Read up on old posts and history of Jihan and Roger Ver and you'll understand why few people here have any trust in their proposals.

There is uncertainty, but one way or another this scaling debate should be going bye-bye after August 1st (at least for a while).
No matter where the cards fall, I think most investors that are in it for the long haul understand that any decrease in price will be temporary and then will be reconciled by a huge come back shortly after.

It won't ever reach $0 because of this split.  The reason this split is a big deal is because of scaling issues with the higher prices and large amounts of newcomers.
Back when the price was at $1k, scaling was a debate, but not a huge issue.
If the chains split, the price might decrease for a little while, but it would rebound again.  At the very least, it worked without scaling at $1k.  If they don't get the scaling worked out, and it goes down to $1k, I'll buy more, because I know it still worked at that amount.

Anyone can run any software they want, it isn't just miners.
Likewise, anyone can develop software, miners included.  
If no one wants to run the code miners developed (BU for instance), then it's no good.  
You're taking a two-sided argument and trying to point it at one side to make them be at fault.  It's hypocritical.  Users (miners are part of this group) decide as a whole what bitcoin becomes.

Don't make this "Core's" fault.  The *users* have decided to reject the miners proposals, because they are unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:22
 It's supply is limited, whereas ETH is not.
 It's resiliency has been proven several times over where altcoins haven't proved they can withstand a large hack or crash for other reasons.
 It is very difficult to change, which means it can't be subverted for nefarious purposes.
Those are a few I can think of off of the top of my head.  I'm sure other people can think of others.

"Amount of money : fee" ratio isn't a thing.  It's "Data Size : fee" ratio.
Bitcoin hasn't scaled well to low value transactions, plain and simple.

They're much better than other exchanges imo.  It may take them a few days to a week to get back to you though.  The last person that had a problem like this and commented, everything got fixed by third day.

They are the ones claiming how much their assets are worth, because they dictating what something is worth with their fiat.
If all of the users have millions of bitcoins in assets, there is literally NO benefit of using the government's fiat.  
You are of the mindset that other people can't guarantee your assets will have value - but there is literally no difference in trusting a government to make that guarantee, because all a government is is a collection of people.
The difference, is that the RULES of the currency can't change in bitcoin.  Something that you absolutely have zero power over when using a government issued fiat.  
As soon as people start trusting a system such as bitcoin, they literally create a stronger guarantee than the one you're claiming is granted by the government.  Take your power back.

I agree - but think that a new hype cycle after whatever crash will bring more new money in and probably some of that slippery new money back to the table.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:40:22
It depends on the wallet software you are using.  From a command line you could certainly do this.  That being said, if you make the fee too low, (such as 0), it will currently never go through.  There are always backlogged transactions.   However, this chart can help.

Do I really need to go into depth with such a sentence as to say in reference to other cryptos over time?  I thought it was clear we were talking about the price of bitcoin as it relates to other cryptos being in the game.
I don't consider any couple day swing in bitcoin as part of a general trend, even when it is as big as 10%.
Yes, the price dropped today.  I could have written my sentence differently as "The price of bitcoin isn't *trending* downward generally", but didn't think it was necessary to qualify what I meant, since no major altcoin was introduced for the first time in the previous few days.  
Using your same logic, I could say your sentence is bullshit because in the last ten minutes the price has increased from 2511 to 2530.  "The price isn't falling, it increased twenty bucks the previous 10 minutes".

Big money is trying to shake out noobies and make money off of them.  
Bitcoin will be back again, as it always does.   
A strong investor holds knowing they'll get their money back.  Sometimes it takes days, sometimes weeks, sometimes months, rarely it has taken years.  
I'm thinking we'll see one or two more rebounds before August 1st, we'll see bitcoin take a giant wet shart temporarily, and then we'll be back in moon territory by the end of the year.
This is bitcoin, it fluctuates a lot because it is still relatively new.

Talk to me in two weeks.  A $500 drop in a single day is significant, but it isn't evident that "bitcoin is failing".  You should note that after every crash, bitcoin has increased greater than the previous all-time-high.
