I just used bitspend.net and it was fantastic, I ended up having to talk to them over the phone due to a mixup on Amazon's part and it felt like I had a buddy taking care of the order for me!

Makes sense, the early money provided the funding for the asics and now that they have them they and are mining with them and it's no issue to refund a few people.

I wouldn't just save the raw wallet.dat on dropbox, but I use a truecrypt volume and back that up to dropbox.

I would have cancelled that transaction and went to the bank that the check is issued from and cashed the check there, then deposit the the cash in your account.

I'm no machinist, and I understand you need to use the small bit for the resolution especially on the edges.  This would take more thought and programming I assume, but would it be practical to use a larger bit to rough cut the larger areas and then use the smaller bit to do finishing work instead of doing ALL the work with the smaller bit?
