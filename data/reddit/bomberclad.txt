No, machines currently don't have "bank accounts" or income. They can't pay for APIs, they can only automate human payment. Which needs to be set up first. Registration+validation at paypal, which in turn requires signing up for a credit card or bank account which in turn requires an ID + detailed information about the person including verification that you're not in deep debt (for the CC), and so on...

Yup, I don't think anyone actually got to buy and test one so far. With the possibility that SP50 is Vapourware with those specs, let's stick to actually avaiable mining chips.
And 21BC's 0.16 *is* far more efficient than S7's 0.25.
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:14:37


Embedding it means you don't need to build a huge mining farm and pay upfront and you distribute the operating costs among all end users, which in turn get a good deal on buying bitcoin worth a couple of bucks each month.
Also, decentralization (once different mining pools can be chosen, which they intend to allow in the future).
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:57:31


So the price will stay the same? When millions of devices are using bitcoin? Under full mainstream adoption?

Bank accounts are tied to identities. They "choose" not to, because it would be illegal. Come on...


Still ignoring the main purpose of all of this: remove as much human interaction as you can, be able to automate as much as you can. "Buy a $25 gift card". Come on! (

Low friction is still orders of magnitute worse than no friction.


Still requiring some soure of funding other than electricty. For that you need a person with access to banking. 21 is talking about "machine payable APIs".


Right now, the chip is more far efficient than most other mining chips, so it wouldn't be at a loss, provided manufacturing costs are low enough, which ich reasonable to assume in a mass market scenario.

That's a stretch for people outside of the STEM field.


That paragraph doesn't make sense to me.


Again, I don't know what you mean. We have to get a feeling for the new denominator anyway. Be it "bitcoins", "microbitcoins" or "bits".


It will be confusing either way. With SI prefixes there's milli and micro ... mBTC can be ambiguous this way... since no one will ever use/typeout µBTC (even I had to copy/paste that, since I don't know how to type it without resorting to some ALT / ASCII code combo). And theres an argument to be made to favour microbitcoins over millibitcoins in regards to existing financial software and people being used to two decimal places. 
Let "Bitcoin" be the technology and "bits" the currency and in 50 years someone will post "TIL 1,000,000 bits were called a bitcoin originally" :P

It's basic human psychology. 1000 of something is more interesting/familiar than the same amount measured as 0.001.
Also, when looking past the U.S., a lot of people already are accustomed to higher numeric values for prices... The mentioned $10 USD lunch in tokyo is 1080.22¥. And if bitcoin is to return to previous highs, we would already be in a 4 digit range with bits as well.

The bitfury miners they use aren't compatible with p2pool. There's a patch for that, but that takes a lot more effort and may not be the only problem (or have side effects).

Bitcoin gains value because people are slowly understanding the potential it holds. Widespread adoption accelerates this, but isn't necessary per se. The current price is probably not reflecting the current "use" value.
But it's useful and very limited. Every person who "wants in on it" increases it's value. The more hoarding, the more limited it is.

Yeah I was thinking of a regular PC when I said USB keyboard. (Although some laptops, especially Apple, do use USB internally.)
Still, my point remains: If you want to be 100% sure, you can't bring the laptop back online. Ever. Using linux won't change that.
You would make an unencrypted paper wallet if you are more confident that you can keep it physically safe than to remember the password. Or you want to be sure your spouse can access your coins in case something happens to you.
Even if you encrypt your wallet, taking the laptop back online (radio or internet), would leave you exposed to a brute-force attack.

Value arises from valuation. Right now bitcoin is valued at ~$375/BTC. Mostly because of speculation about it's future at this point.
Bitcoin is however not worthless without fiat on/off ramps, because it offers something no other technology can: digital tokens that you can't duplicate and are not managed by a central entity. Utility is valued.
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:21:50
You dont use "kilodollars" or "millidollars" either.
Just use "bits". Always. Everywhere. And once in a while say "bitcoin" instead of "one million bits" to get some early adopter street cred.
Bitcoin = the technology.
bits = the unit.

But do they do this 1:1? I doubt that. There's probably a big buffer, especially with coinbase where you can buy bitcoin.
Just saying the negative effect that people buying stuff with bitcoin have on the price is probably negligible at this point.
@_date: 2014-08-28 10:18:09
The main point is the psychology behind owning 0.001 or 1000 of something.
And if you are talking "µBTC" vs "bit", then yes.. I think "bit" is **way** more user friendly. Just drop "Bitcoin" as a unit alltogether.

The argument is to accept the possibility of a little bit of confusion early on by switching the standard unit to "bits" in order to make bitcoin easier to work with and more familiar to average users.
People are more used to handling big numbers with two decimals, than small numbers with up to 8 decimals. This also applies to a lot of financial software. And then theres the stupid, but undeniable psychological effect of having 1,000,000 -vs- 0.01 of something.
If you think that's stupid, then sorry: you're wrong. Accept it and move on :P

Downward pressure due to increase acceptance from merchants is a myth I think. Those merchants dont sell their bitcoin on bitstamp.
Yes, hodling reduces supply and every hodler deciding to hodl will lift the price up a bit. But then, as new bitcoin gets mined, it will continue to go down (since I doubt there will be more bitcoin made unavailable through new hodlers, then made available through mining).
Block halving will reduce inflation, but the trend would still be downwards without new money coming in.

Bitcoin can (and IMHO will) replace gold. It is, or rather will be better as a store of value in every way. It's just not as trusted, yet. Also more volatile due to the shallow market.
It'll get value from A to B at the highest speed possible for the cheapest price possible.
