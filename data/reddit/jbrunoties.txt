Not about getting rich, about creating more liquidity in a very problematic space, that is, onboarding sustainable tourism capacity in developing regions and nations.

BTC almost seems to have two different constituencies, and what is difficult is the perception that there is no "benevolent boss".  That is a great selling point to some, and a bar to adoption for some others.  The folks I'm discussing are not crypto vs fiat people, they're crypto vs barter people.  
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:34:14
First, Henry is real.  He emailed me yesterday.  He has email.  Second, what does that last sentence mean?  
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:09:25
@_date: 2019-03-18 14:26:09
To take this further, the first page that comes up in a web search is [this]( a Paxful site, that appears to want steam cards and needs the equivalent of $6,500 for one BTC.  
That costs more than a wire or western union.  That costs more than a bank check, even with international post.  
So I'm asking again.  A lot of talk goes on about free, fluid money, etc.  but here we see more charlatans and "middle men".  
So here is a chance to take the first steps to support BTC to be the currency of a 7 trillion industry.  We can sit around posting "Teh BTC is all u need bra!!1!" or we can actually provide real solutions to real people with real business problems.  Thoughts?  
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:32:25
So I am in sustainable tourism.  As you may know, tourism is the only top ten retail (primarily consumer) industry that has a global revenue impact.  However, 85% of capacity is locked out of the financial system and further has an issue repatriating funds.  Companies like Paypal, which in G20 countries we imagine to be relatively benign, show their true faces in developing countries, and it isn't pretty.  Further, average time to receive funds that have ALREADY been paid (not receivable age) is 9 months.  No one can do business like that.  I can talk for days about these issues.  
I looked at ecocoin, but not enough data yet.  
@_date: 2019-03-16 18:35:14
Understood and appreciated.  But this is the only way I know to get real information.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:13:23
If BTC is going to grow capitalization, it will not be because of "I  ♥  ₿" memes.  I suggest the next phase is killer app solutions.  Would welcome thoughts for the question I posed [here]( It needs to be the leading solution currency for a business problem.  
@_date: 2019-03-18 13:20:39
So I ask the question of HOW for bitcoin [here]( and no one answers.  
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:52:27
I appreciate the desire to share information, but until you have actually worked in and among communities in developing nations, I think it is inappropriate to refer to them as "silly".  They are often low on opportunity, ability to access education, and what you and I would call basic necessities.  
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:41:38
I have no altcoin to explain or promote.  I am asking questions.  Only people who gamble, hope, and hide resent questions.  Please see other responses for examples of people answering questions
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:40:09
To continue  [this]( thread with an example, Real person Henry from Free Town, Sierra Leone wants to join an online training program in sustainable tourism.  He, as an average person in Sierra Leone, has absolutely no access to the global financial system.  Unlike G20 countries where lawyer, doctor, engineer, financier etc are "bootstrap" professions where one can work one's way up the financial ladder, the ONLY bootstrap profession available to most people in over 100 countries is tourism.  To demonstrate professional bona fides, Henry wants to enroll in and pass a certification course.  He has no credit card, no access to a bank that will send international wires for him, no access to ACH, no access to SWIFT, etc.  However, he does have and make money.  
Please tell me exactly, step by step, in excruciating detail, how Henry can acquire BTC inexpensively and pay them, and you will have both made a convert and more importantly given someone an opportunity to reach their dream.

That is an absurd statement.  Further, it is antithetical to the spirit of adoption and inquiry which made bitcoin possible.  
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:47:36
Thanks for the suggestion - I will look at this.  I have sort of a "use case" but I need to understand whether the properties I want could exist in a BTC application.  
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:35:50
Why I applaud the thought behind your suggestions, I really think you have no idea what life in Freetown, Sierra Leone is like.  If I may ask, are you from a G20 or "second world" nation?  
Let's start with this.  Henry has email.  How can he set himself up with a wallet?  Let's tell a person for whom English is a third language, in simple terms, exactly how he can get a wallet.  Then, let's tell him how to receive BTC.  Do we have a resource we can point to, or would one of you be able to post this?  You have my thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:33:28
It is truly amazing that someone can imagine that this post makes a positive statement about bitcoin, i.e. "the exchanges and security are so incompetent or corrupt that there will be less supply and that's good for me!"  What you are arguing against is adoption.  There is nothing inevitable about any currency, fiat, digital, or commodity.  
By your stupid argument, we should just shoot gold into the sun.  
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:10:40
EXPECTO PATRONEEEEEEEMMM!
@_date: 2019-02-04 02:15:17
That's pretty obvious.  Adoption is what gives bitcoin value, not scarcity.  For scarcity to have value, there must be DEMAND and that relies on adoption.  
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:38:48
Fantastic work, thanks for posting.  BTC has a lot of possibility in 2nd and 3rd world countries and among "unbanked" people (what a ridiculous name, as if the default state of a person is to have a bank account).  I would like to do a case study in certain industries - is there a group I could join that has like minded people?
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:55:17
Argentina is a wonderful example.  Beautiful country, beautiful culture, beautiful people.  A large land with excellent commodities and a national work ethic.  However, at the community level the average Argentinian is sometimes not able to benefit from the monetization of these commodities and resources, and as a whole the country is underserved by tourism.  
I'm speaking specifically of sustainable tourism, where I have considerable expertise.  Sustainable tourism tends to have venues, vendors and destinations that are smaller and many that do not have access to the global financial system.  They pay huge fees and wait sometimes 9 months or more to patriate their funds from payments - a receivable age of over 270 days, which would kill many businesses ans which makes their business untenable.  
Of course Buenos Aires does well by some of these standards, but there is so much more to the country.  PM me or reply and I'm very glad to talk any time.  
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:00:04

Actually it is fairly common; further, you said it wasn't even the payment for a one bedroom, not "top notch" and if the average one bedroom goes for above 1 million then there is the demand and therefore the customer base with the income to make the payments - c'mon dude, you know the real story - you bragged on the internet and someone called you out on it.  If you want, go to Zillow for Manhattan, San Fran, LA, Silicon Valley, etc and you'll find NUMEROUS 1 bedroom apartments for 850,000 or less.  You can even find tons of them for 400,000k in all those places.  If you don't live in one of those places, the average one bedroom is even less.  
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:59:52
Still, attacking every other coin is the same as pumping your favorite.  If BTC can exist, then so can others.  Same with gold, silver, platinum, dollars, yuan, pounds, etc.

Considering a down payment can be as little as 5% if you have good credit, where do you live that 1 bedrooms cost more that 1.7million USD?

Right.  Buy at $2500 and sell at $100,000 got it.

Very small businesses are generally sold for 2-3 times free cash flow.  OP would need to demonstrate free cash flow of roughly 55k annually to justify that price.  Because it's in Thailand, with an uncertain regulatory environment, I'd be thinking 2 times free cash flow to owner and you need to be either an experienced bar owner or a Thai business owner .

No one is disputing any of that, but someone wants to be in Manhattan because the demand is there.  Nevertheless, nice, new 1 bedrooms in good Manhattan can be had for 1m, and can be bought for an 85k down payment with ridiculously good credit and a respectable income.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:15:18
That's thinking ahead!
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:07:42
In Manhattan there are 1700+ one bedrooms less than 1m, and only 800 or so over 1mUSD.   The median is below 1m.  Just like with anything you can pay too much if you want, but the bulk of 1 bedrooms will be less than 1M.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 14:59:47
Where you live, more 1 bedrooms are &lt;1m than are &gt; 1m, and you can find really nice 1 bedrooms for &lt;1m.  Even in Manhattan, Moscow, Tokyo, London, San Francisco, Rome, Seoul, and Shanghai.

How does that matter?  Above he said 85,000 would not be a down payment on a 1 bedroom, he didn't say in a new building.  In reality, there is no city in the world where 1mUSD cannot get you a nice 1 bedroom.  There's a really great one bedroom at the Avery, a new building on UWS near Lincoln Center: Price  **$999,000** 
That's nice, new, best neighborhood, great location, full service.

What a great thing to have real information from Venezuela.
To be honest, I'm puzzled by it.  Venezuela has $15Trillion USD worth of oil (at today's very low prices of $52/b) and produces a barrel at $27.
Venezuela has some of the best natural tourism in the world.  The people seem hardworking, thrifty, and smart.
I'm actually trying to hire some Venezuelans right now, but there seems to be too much chaos to make it work - most people want to go to Ecuador or Colombia.

Help everyone switch to digital currencies with 6 simple steps:
1.  Disallow thieving magpies by any means necessary
2. Make a simple interface that takes 5 minutes to learn and sign up for, and 5 minutes to trade in and out of
3. Use testimonials from actual new users, not tech genius long time hodlers with unpronounceable names
4. Decide whether you're anarchists or people with a future, and commit
5. Stop trying to work against governments and start working with them
6. Aggressively expose and combat predatory practices employed by "mainstream" financial institutions

If you want to know what these motherfuckers are really like, they charge 4% in and out in the US, but in many developing countries they go over 10%.  So where the people can least afford it, they are the most rapacious.  Further, they act like it is their money.  It isn't, scumbags, people bought your product with their money, but Paypal pretends it becomes theirs and you are using it at their pleasure.
