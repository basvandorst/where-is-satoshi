I should have clarified: no active buyer on the exchanges. The guy willing to pay $10k off-exchange isn't affecting the price in real-time.
My point was only that holding alone does not raise prices. Holding from the seller perspective is no different than waiting for lower prices from the buying perspective. There's two forces at work here. Theoretically, if bitcoin demand continues to fall and then eventually ceases to exist, you can hold every single bitcoin in existence and they'd still be worth nothing. No I don't think that's going to happen.

You know that for every stock seller there is a buyer too, right? Ever hear of market makers? 
It does literally nothing to prevent prices from rising or falling.

...which does nothing to prevent price from crashing as far as it will crash.

But there was never 800 billion US dollars invested. Not even close. Market cap is simply total coins outstanding times current coin price. Price is controlled entirely by supply and demand. Demand has clearly dropped given the 50+% price decline and all. Is that a strong market? 
If there was 700 billion more US dollars on the sideline waiting to buy bitcoins, what’s stopping it?

In terms of valuation or just what bitcoin is? The former no, the latter, I think so. Admittedly, the white papers aren't exactly easy reading for anyone without a comp sci degree. Add that to the list of barriers to entry for the general public.

Buying these coins is speculating, not investing. Most people are bad at speculating, so don't feel bad.

It could drop another 50, 60, 70+%. $8500 may look like a distant dream in a few weeks. Or it may look like an amazing buying opportunity. 
Point being, selling at the top is nice, but selling half way down the decline isn’t so bad either. Just make peace with the potential end results and choose a course of action based on your risk tolerance.

Natural result of any FOMO induced bubble. 
And this crash is so much worse than the others in terms of long term damage to the crypto market. The other crashes weren't preceded by weeks of front page coverage on every news outlet. Who in their right minds is going to get back now after watching this thing fall from $20k to $7k in the blink of an eye?

No it doesn't. The price of bitcoin is determined by those participating in the buy-sell process right now at this moment. As it stands, there's no active buyer in the entire world that is willing to pay more than $8800 (or so) for a bitcoin. Your holding on to your stake doesn't change that fact.

Sentiment like this is part of the problem, not the solution. Claiming that price falls are always the result of some form of "manipulation" or "FUD" or whatever encourages people to bail on their positions.

See, when the price rises there are always good, fundamental reasons for doing so. No matter how hard, how fast, if the price is rising it’s because of legitimate buying activity based on rationale ideas and intelligent investment decisions.
Anything causing the price to fall is FUD, manipulation, futures contacts rolling over, bots, and other typical bullshit schemes run by the big traders. They want the price down so they can buy more bitcoin at lower prices. 
Why not just buy now and let the aforementioned bottled up fundamental, legitimate, rationale buying take their bitcoins to $40k, $50k, $100k and beyond? Only a nocoin troll would ask such a stupid question.

Stocks have intrinsic value. They (well, not all) generate positive cash flow and profits. As an investor you are entitled to a share of those profits and rewarded with capital gains as the company grows. 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. That doesn't mean its worthless or worse than the stock market. Just far far harder to value.

Stock market is still up big in January?

Ha alright at least now I know for sure you are just trolling. Well done.
