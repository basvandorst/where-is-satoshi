How do you feel about the markets in general in 2014.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:15:02
I see this as a long term thing.. I mean the whole 'year of wall street' and stuff I just don't see it happening 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:28:17
I can't agree with that notion... there has been a dilution .. it's not the same

If I were a Sci-fi writer, this is how I would answer the question:
1. Religion: Satoshi as a Jesus like figure in 100 to 200 years.
2. War: Electronic (cyber) and phyiscal (traditional). War will be carried out between mining factions. Mining facilities will be hidden around the globe. Underwater and in deep caves, in glaciers, etc. Rebel groups (terrorists) will have the goal of destroying ALL mining operations (physically or via hacking) in order to break the hold of the bitcoin wealthy who are oppressing the weak.

How do I put these hashes into the blockchain? I've been looking for this for a while. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:33:37
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:51:46
Hmm. Looks like I will wait a few more months. If twister is as big as bitcoin there will still be, according to history, 1-2 years of waiting before it takes off in any way. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:03:56
Paper wallets are dead simple. Bring a laptop with bitaddress site on it (offline) and generate a wallet for him.
Send the coins there and then tell him to treat it as if he lost it then they are fuckin gone forever and no one is liable except him. 
Tell him to hide it like he would hide a bar of gold. And tell him the private key is worth whatever amount of money he put into it.
You could Bip32 it. If he has a password he knows well and won't forget... but that's just adding another layer of technology to something that he already struggles with.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:05:03
Even more so I think. (than other stocks)
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:39:05
Wow that sucks, I always assumed that everything was on par. Sounds like there is opportuntity though.. for someone to come in with a better model, if that's even possible based on the way that the culture works over there.

Referring to dogecoin though. RIP bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:23:41
I heard about it a while ago, but don't go there often. Bitcoinsec is a cool topic that i'd love to see a vibrant community around, so I don't really care which subreddit 'takes off' as long as one does.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:11:50
They struck a deal. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:31:43
Pretty sure the price is being kept at 800 by hugely funded bots. Wouldn't bet on either direction right now tbh.
feel free to ask there... they like trading and drawing weird lines on charts.. but they are always wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:11:34
If any coin wants to take over Bitcoin it will have to outdo the Satoshi story somehow. I don't think it's possible. There's too much myth and intrigue there.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:17:57
It is because it is understood that bitcoin is not at its final resting value yet.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:16:01
Its a good fit. A moneymaking fit. I have only 2 thoughts.
1. In a small market where most traders are pretty smart/nerdy, can TA be a self-fulfilling prophecy?
2. Will it actually slide to 400 like the april/december comparison suggests?
Needless to say, the next month or so will  be interesting
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:55:06
Magic fairy dust.
Also, exponential growth
Searching through older threads, there has been a trend towards gross underestimation of BTC future value. 
Now that we are finally making ballsy predictions, I fully expect them to be unfulfilled. RIP Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:14:15
I'd like to see such a survey.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:16:23
I'm not sure how the bots are programmed. I would have to believe that they would continue selling until they found support, for this reason:
* If they never tried to find support, the price wouldn't be able to follow the market as well, which would probably lessen the amount of trading 
But someone else feel free to correct me
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:03:46
Because the bots help keep the market price at its true value
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:56:18
1200 is a shitty place to be right now but don't worry because as bad as this crash was, the post crash sentiment is WAAAAYYYYY different than it was after the december crash. Back then it was suicide and blackness... right now people are actually happy and laughing .. or maybe i'm just loopy from being up all night.. fuck why does it always crash in the middle of the night. lol
love me sum btcs
anyways my point is that the market tone has shifted and I think we will break upwards as soon as the forces on the market allow for it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:56:30
Now you get that money to a financial advisor (not just anyone either. Find the best in your area) who can throw it in low risk slow growth funds , or read up on vanguard and do it yourself. 
 
with money comes stress, it may just be best to offload your wealth to a real advisor who is used to seeing multimillion sums. they can advise you on how to diversify. 
be prepared to see it grow slowly compared to bitcoin, bre prepared to see it lose money (like in 2008), or even be prepared for the rest of your bitcoin holdings to become worthless too.
i think you made a good choice though. 
edit: whatever you do, make sure to take your time and learn before you say yes to anyone.
edit: i'm also not sure how much real help you will get in this sub. there are others on reddit like , im not sure how smart they are over there but it might at least be worth a look at their top posts of all time .
edit: I also forgot to say congrats and good luck moving foward.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:19:23
Hey man if it makes you feel better most of the smartest people of our generation are or will be working on bitcoin in the coming years. You aren't just investing in Bitcoin but also the collective brainpower of these people who are working to help out this technology.
edit: At the same time, bitcoin is attracting the most nefarious people of our generation as well. It will be a fun ride either way. But to your main point, there is no way that computer code can't be written to fix any potential problems. Coding is a superpower.

if you kept them you would have sold them long long ago my friend.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:37:51
I'll tell you what I did. I created an electrum wallet using a live USB linux boot, and then put the electrum seed onto 3 different encrypted USB sticks that I store in various places. I also memorized the seed just in case.
The purpose of the live usb boot is so that once the computer shuts off, all traces of the seed are GONE. Your coins literally will not exist anywhere on the internet.. they only exist on the usb sticks and in your brain.
Encrypt the sticks and they will be virtually unhackable.. why? because i doubt anyone who is smart enough to even begin cracking them would be able to even get physical access to them in the first place.

They do live on the cloud, but if they are on someone elses website, that means that the other person has access to the code needed to 'own' those coins, which means you might lose them.

Hi I just build it myself from the data given on blockchain.info
It's quite misleading, as I had to divide the diff by 100,000 to keep it in range.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:24:41
When there are stories of people already cashing out with 100's of millions of dollars from BTC, you gotta always be ready for it to disappear at any point. Mentally prepare for that scenario and then invest still if you are ready.

Hey this is my bot.. i'm still working on it . I might need to adjust the value at which this type of post will be triggered.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:00:40
I'm pretty good at betting on the future in broad terms, but I'm not very good at predicting it... so if you want an exact reason why then I will probably be wrong.
That said if I have to stop and think about it I would say that the best motivatoin would be a loss of trust in other forms of money which is what made me make the switch... honestly all the signs are in place and I think the rest of the world just needs to catch up ..
1. Credit card hacks
2. Fiats inflating like crazy 
3. Missing gold stores
But those are all pretty political or I guess economic reasons .. if you are trying to determine the 'cool factor' that will make people switch then I think that comes down to infrastructure... wait until a popular tv show has a bitcoin qr code for voting on american idol or something... forget text messages.
I mean, its clear that there are things you can do with BTC that you just cannot with regular cash. We just need some smart people in this space that are willing to build cool things. I want to try my hand at it honestly. i wanna build a cool bitcoin business that has nothing to do with exchanging fiat for btc. I figure I have a bout a 1 year window to get something through
let me know what you think.

Seriously though, its a good thing for bitcoin to lose gox.
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:40:01
For example, can you retroactively apply TA to previous bubbles in bitcoin  and accurately predict post-bubble behaviour?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:26:01
How did you save the key to dropbox? Was it in a text file? Was it encrypted or just out in the open?
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:26:27
Just thinking that if everyone is trading based on TA info, then the market will behave according to the predictions. 
But that is pretty far fetched. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:59:41
Exactly. That's why I think you made a great move and I would have done the same. In fact many have done what you did at the 1000 mark. Did you see the guy who moved 100,000 coins a few weeks ago? Looks like he realized some pretty nifty gains as well ;)
As it goes anyways... you now have enough money to be comfortable 'forever' so it would be dumb to not cash out. Now you can relax and watch crypto from a slight distance.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:34:27
Well he put Cuban to shame. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:51:06
When i'm completely optimistic about bitcoin I have thoughts like that, yes. But it's very stressful staying completely in coin, and I think that this poster really wants to go the low stress route. 
It also sounds like he has enough coin that even if and when that happens, he will still be one of the richest people on earth, so whatever. Let the wealth redistribute.
And advisors aren't all bad. They take care off everything for you. If your life is very hectic otherwise then they can be of great service. Same as having someone help you with your taxes. 
But I don't want to sound like I am arguing against you. Because I agree with you. But its not all black and white.

What I find interesting is comparing the graphs of the price and the difficulty.  
If you overlay the price graph and the difficulty graph they pretty much line up until the december crash. 
Makes me wonder: In a vacuum, would the price rise in unison with the difficulty? And if so, is difficulty a predictor of price? 
Or is the difficulty simply a lagging indicator of where the price was?
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:27:45
Sounds pretty good. I'll code it tomorrow.
Open to suggestions of whether or not I should actually do this. Otherwise I will.

What I am scared of, is that everything Satoshi posted on his account basically came true so far.. but he said some way out there stuff like
"well its 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people, so just grab a few"
I don't want to say that hes from the future, but he is so far.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:55:47

Your coins are probably in a wallet.dat if you were mining them.
The best way to access them is to grab that wallet.dat and load it into a fresh install of bitcoin-qt 
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:44:16
Alright, this seems like the most likely way your coins got stolen then. Whoever has your coins had access to your dropbox files. Maybe your dropbox is public? I found some .key files just by typing this into google:
'site:dropbox.com filetype:key'

All smart and humble users left this subreddit during the previous bubble. We've reached the point where the new community is driving out the old. The voices in here are no longer a good representative of what Bitcoin really is or is about. 
From here on out, if you want to learn about a bitcoiner, you will have to talk to them individually.

@_date: 2014-01-21 00:34:54
No, and here is why:
1) With a tiny USD investment, you can probably own more DOGE by percentage of total than you already have in BTC. 
2) Litecoin blew up in 2013 and Bitcoins are still around. Maybe there is a moneymaking opportunity with DOGE but Bitcoin will always be king.
3) Dogecoin is brining in tons of new blood. Tons. 10 years from now, when all the Dogecoiners are in their mid 20's and mid 30's, what do you think will happen to crypto in general?

There are 3 ways to get into an encrypted wallet that I know of.
1. This is the obvious one. Remembering the password. It's probably in your brain somewhere. Maybe you remember the password, or where you hid it? 
2. This involves having a general idea of what the password was. Then someone like walletrecoveryservices will use a brute force algorithm to try and gain access to your wallet (in a good way). 
You have a vague recollectoin that the password had something to do with spaghetti and your birthyear. You tell them this. They then set up a script that tries stuff like this
spaghetti1990    
sp4gh3tttti199O    
sp_hGhetiNINteen90    
etc. 
3. If your wallet was ever NOT encrypted in the past, it may still be on your hard drive somewhere in that state. You would have to use some sort of data recovery program for this.
In either case, I would learn towards you being able to remember the password, since you came up with it in the first place. Also, good luck.
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:24:19
Sounds cool!
Mind sharing the code? Or is it top secret?
My gut feeling is that it's probably easier to buy/sell based on sentiment
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:12:50
The best way would probably be to feed the bot the info of people who post up scams (like the guy who posts up the fake bitcoin-qt)

Well your opinion is perfectly rational for someone who is only here for a short time, but Bitcoin is i dont know, 5 years old? And Gox has been messing things up for years.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:21:07
The market was overstreched. The chinese aren't stupid. They have been doing this 'bubble popping' for a while. 
Their citizens have so much cash that they don't know what to do with it. So naturally whenever a good investment is found, a bubble forms. 
So china has to step in and pop these bubbles before they get out of control.
Look, china wasn't involved in April. They weren't involved in the previous bubbles and pops before that either.
When the market is overstreched, it will pop no matter the cause. There is no telling how high it could have gone before popping this time. Maybe 2000? 
China played their role. They caused some loss to their citizens, but they may have stopped much more. However, now they are putting a very nefarious spin on Bitcoin. They aren't dumb - they realize how powerful bitcoins are. They also know that they can't stop it through simple bans. They are trying to spread FUD in order to turn their citizens against bitcoins. 
What saddens me is watching the idiots either
A) Buy into the FUD      
B) Sell when whales capitalize on the FUD by causing a crash     
Now in the short term the markets might go down to 300, 400, 500. Who knows. But in 10 years? It's not going to matter what China thinks.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:00:14
When is the last time you read a newspaper?
Ok that was kind of cryptic. What I am getting at is, it doesn't matter what he says... new technology always phases out old technology. Ease of use of the new tech coupled with lack of adaptation by the old tech... it's a pattern that always has and always will occur.
He is adding shock value of course, but that's because his name is his brand.
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:17:58
Yes. The news was underwhelming and expected. The fear of China still looms large. The price isn't going up anytime soon is my best guess. 
If you are into TA you would probably say they are headed down.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:35:41
It's huge. Absolutely insane. But don't count on the price of BTC being connected in any way. But as far as adoption goes? Yeah this is huge.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:27:41
Yea, its very clear to me that potential Bitcoin dollars is distributed through the alts, and I can see how it would cause some worry, but it's just a natural part of the growth.. and why? Because people have to TEST bitcoin before giving in to it. Right now younger people are saying 'Fuck you bitcoin, we dont want you' just like bitcoins are saying 'Fuck you fiat, we don't want you'... but what will happen is that Bitcoin will win like always, and they will come over to BTC. Right now people in alts are learning a lot about crypto and that is only a good thing.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:11:04
Yeah that's what I was thinking too. I'm not trying to get into that wallet. Those aren't my coins to try and take, but I just am debating the best way to store my coins.

What's a bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:53:57
Uh no. Since there are only 21 million, if they are worth 1 cent a piece, you would literally have to buy every single bitcoin in order to make a decent sized transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:04:00

Sounds like you need someone to help you out day to day man. Or you could try and learn all that stuff yourself too. Learning social interaction isn't too tough but I mean.. going from being a recluse who mines bitcoins to being a powerful businessman almost overnight has to be a scary change for sure. But plenty of nerds do it all the time... just look at silicon valley.
I would say just to be wary of anyone who wants access to your wealth. Yeah throwing away the account is a good step.
I look foward to hearing updates on the BTC/Tesla duo. Hope you can get something worked out (the sooner the better because honestly, nothing is going to stop this train.. time will make it inevitable anyways.)

Interesting. If you want to put your code on github or pastebin i'd be willing to take a look at it
If you want to keep it closed thats cool to
my guess is that you are passing all the coins through a function that determines the ratio to BTC, and would avoid the problem if you didnt pass BTC through as well?

Yea I hear you. That's what I thougt too until i researched them.
First of all, they started as a magic the gathering card exchange 
Magic    
The    
Gathering    
Online      
Xchange   
ahahahha. No thanks.
After that, they have caused tons of bitcoin crashes in the past. Flash crashes due to hacks, site going down etc. 
Next, they have a terrible record of getting your money back to you. They invented the term Gox bucks. That's why coins are more expensive there, because people can't get cash out, so they buy coins instead.
Honestly I don't know why people even daytrade bitcoins. It's a risk that you can't afford, and its showing right now.
I would only advise trading to people who are experienced in volatility (people who can spot the top of bubbles mainly) and have lots of coins so that they can lose a lot and not care.
Otherwise its best to just buy on the dips and keep your coins in cold storage.
Let this be a lesson... once you get your coins back dont do business with Gox

Interesting question.. I wonder if you could do this with namecoin? 
I wonder if it is possible to build an altcoin that 'lives' on all of the blockchains, where you could send payment to a persons 'name' which contains data like this
BTC address     
DOGE address     
LTC address     
And all you have to do is send money to that name and it automatically knows which blockchain to send the crypto to 
This would requires all of the blockchains to 'communicate' with one another...
This seems pretty interesting though..

Those are services
Bitcoin is a protocol, like tcp/ip, email (general), etc.
Doge fills a huge market need right now though, which is the ability to own hundreds/thousands very easily. It's fun and makes you feel good.
But it is all just decimal places. Either way, I don't think our communities need to be fighting... doge has lots of room to grow and it and bitcoin should be chilling on a beach side by side. I personally think litecoin is a joke. yall should be warring with them.

Interesting. sounds like namecoin will be super important for the future. 
I have to admit that I know nothing about it though. Are they mineable still (difficulty, my computers blow) or do I have to trade for them?
Are there a limited amount?
Do I need a new coin every time I want to update information?
Do you need a WHOLE coin or just partials?
Also, is namecoin 'smart'? Can I send BTC to a namecoin id value?
I just hopped on  i will lurk there for a bit, and I guess I will check the subreddit for faqs and stuff. sorry for so many questions but its a very interesting alt-coin.
I just heard that apparently there are some huge problems with namecoin which is unfortunate, as the idea is one that deserves a good implementation.

It's simply too soon for gen 2 cryptocoins. We don't even know what bitcoin is yet, and already they are trying to improve on it?

Yes I think you are right. By spending lots of time here you are basically opening up situations where you might be tempted to cut and run. 
Those who have done well have either completely forgotten about their bitcoins, or are huge holders that believe very strongly in bitcoins.

Well, mining is the most complex part of the whole bitcoin thing.
What happens when someone mines bitcoins is that they are rewarded 25 bitcoins for solving a puzzle (yes this means you will get around 20 thousand dollars). By solving this puzzle they verify all of the bitcoins that people have spent in the time since the last puzzle was solved.
Kind of a mind twister already isnt it?
But with mining, and heres the thing, the faster your computer is, the better the chance is that you will solve one of the puzzles. At this point, there is no way to solve that puzzle with basically owning a supercomputer. Why? Because of competition. Everyone wants to mine bitcoins, so there is a lot of competition, which makes the puzzles super hard to solve.
Check that chart out. It's a picture of how hard it is to mine bitcoins. Look how much it grew. Its insane.
So as far as mining, its not a viable option for anyone right now really. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:01:27

@_date: 2014-01-01 00:07:11

No no i'm not that smart, electrum is great because it turns the seed into a 12 word phrase. 
Like this:
"beach dig under shovel weapon light door friend cloud car animal"
That is the only thing you need to remember to access an unlimited amount of wallets where you keep your coins (it is what is called deterministic, meaning it creates wallets based on that seed)
You can then export something called a master public key which lets you watch over your balance without compromising the coins. Right now I could literally hand over my computer to a russian born chinese hacker and I wouldnt even give two shits. No coins on here.

Looks like you made two points, so let me respond to each.
1. Advantages in protocol vs prices. If the advantages in the protocol are extreme enough to make adoption pretty high then the price can only rise. Cheap bitcoins are not useful for moving around real money in the system. I hope you understand what I mean. Bitcoins on the whole are worth 10 B right now? There isn't yet room for peoples wealth in bitcoin. Prices cannot go down while meaningful adoption goes up. If bitcoin ends up being a fad that isn't useful then yes it will have basically been a ponzi scheme.
2. Monitoring transactions, NWO, borderless currency. It's a fun story. But I personally believe that no one in a position of power has a single creative bone in their body. Too much red tape etc. Bitcoin was the work of a rebel. Not a bureaucrat

If someone told me right now BTC would never gain any value I would still go all in just for how convienient it is, and for how much control I get over MY MONEY. Not waiting weeks to liquidate assets and dealing with scumbag advisors etc.
But as far as getting that car you want for BTC, you really should do something more advanced. I'm assuming you sent emails/called etc, but you have money now. Do something crazy like running an ad campaign, sponsoring one of their recharging nodes... i dont know the possibilities are endless.

He is coming from the assumption that only thieves and crooks use bitcoins, and that as soon as they are regulated, people will vacate.
What he doesn't realize, and what Gavin does, is that the more regulations are placed on bitcoins, the clearer the path becomes, and the more and more they will be used.
Why would people use bitcoins instead of other methods? Because bitcoins are simply better. They are the future of money. They are BETTER money. 
He will learn soon.

No one has to be a sucker with bitcoin... If you told me right now that I could put everything i owned into bitcoin, and it wouldnt rise by a single cent (or fall) I would do it just based on the advantages in the protocol
this is assuming a future where bitcoin = liquidity

Probably nothing as glamorous as all that. 
Whoever he is, he has probably mined a decent (but not outrageous) amount of BTC after the initial "Satoshi Coins" (which he won't touch). It probably wouldn't be too hard to find him. I'm sure he pulled a Ross Ulbricht and made posts hinting at the idea of Bitcoin before it was ever called that.
Do I believe that Satoshi is one person, and not a group? Yes very much so. I think that true innovation comes from a mind unimpeded by regulations. 
So let's just say that the governments know who he is. Why would they want to assasinate him? That just sounds so tinfoil.

@_date: 2014-01-22 05:12:46
Well back in the early days you could get bitcoins pretty easily by mining, asking for them, buying lots for cheap, etc.
But things changed once they became valuable.
Now the best way to get bitcoins is to buy them, or sell things for them (service, goods, etc).
You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin, they are divisible. But you have to ask yourself why you want bitcoins... if its for investment, or for buying things only bitcoins can buy, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:51:02
With blockchain you need to trust yourself, with coinbase you need to trust them.

I have had nothing but amazing dealings with coinbase. They are the only place I have bought from, and I have never had 1 single problem. Have bought many many times as well.
The negative reviews are from a small sample size of their customers .. and as far as I can tell they are all resolved. If not there would be someone here right now saying that they have been waiting X amount of months with no response. it's simply not possible.
I had my doubts before buying from coinbase too but it isn't an issue to me anymore, and i've even been trusting enough to leave some of my btc on their site long term as a hot wallet
in fact I am going to try using their site today as a hot wallet to purchase some things
In time there will be more competitors to coinbase, but they are the best for what you need today. Or you could buy local but most people highly inflate the price and plus that means you have to interact with someone face to face which can be an issue for new buyers who aren't familiar with how BTC works.

1. yes they are called cassius(?) coins, but they aren't anything but a coin with a real bitcoin put on in the form of a code on the back. real bitcoins aren't physical they are digital, there is no such thing as a physical bitcoin.
2. They are real, and they are cryptocurrency just like bitcoins, but they are much more... ... ... ..you are gonna have to go to to find out.
3. Maybe. Bitcoin is a pretty grand idea. It could end up being something pretty cool that a lot of people use. If so then it would be worth it. Very risky though, i'm not guaranteeing any returns. Many who invested in november are sitting on losses

@_date: 2014-01-05 05:45:03
Yup. I actually learned of this myself.
Here is the straight facts and how you can discover this one weird tip for yourself.
So we all know that bitcoin is based on something known as cryptology. Well what happens is that the founder of bitcoin 'Satoshi Nakamoto' left some messages in bitcoin that he wanted people to find.
One example of this is the message he left in the raw code of the genesis block:
Translated through a hex -&gt; ascii script you get this message:
“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”
So this proves that Satoshi was leaving messages behind for Bitcoiners to discover the truth behind who he was, and his sudden disappearance.
So here is where things get interesting.
No one knows who Satoshi is, but in his last message in the spring of 2011,  he said that he had “moved on to other things”.
Well guess which game was released in fall of 2011? You guessed it. Minecraft.
"was published as a full release version on November 18, 2011" -&gt; From wiki
So this made me believe that Notch was Satoshi Nakamoto. 
it sounds CRAZY, but there is IRREFUTABLE proof in the blockchain.

I don't really know too much about TA . For me its easy just to predict a pop when the price goes parabolic and people say things like 'to the moon' on every post etc. 
All of the TA you provided only predicted the fact that a bubble was going to pop... I don't find that useful as that is one of the easiest calls to make in investing.

Yes, but it is a neccesary part of the growth of cryptocurrency as an idea. 
Without dogecoin much of the younger, more casual, or less politically inclined people wouldn't even care about crypto, but now they are addicted. 
Others like litecoin etc are neccesary as well just by way of giving bitcoin a challenge. A champion isn't a champion without beating out competition. 
I think the book is closing fast on random alts. Coinye and Dogecoin probably helped to do that by the former failing catastrophically and the latter rocketing up so successfully .
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:34:31
Well gridcoin looks like it is using whatever beneficial to society processing power thing they can think of.
First of all, this means that somewhere down the line, the devs could drop in something malicious .. say cracking peoples actual passwords
Second, there is no way to keep track of or increment difficulty. I doubt mining would be stable in this case.
Third, and the point I made earlier, If you know what you are working on as a miner, and it is a nonrandom thing, there is a possibility that you can optimize around the problem especially if it is in an area you are a specialist in, and gain an unfair advantage over other miners.

I think that another coin taking over bitcoin would only happen if bitcoin suffers a catastrophic failure of some sort, and I would put the probability of that happening at a very low level..... 
Bitcoin has had years to sort of the kinks.. and there are more to come, but they are becoming less and less worrisome. Currently the biggest threat is probably the miners that have too much power over the network.
But as far as AOL vs Google think of it this way:
Bitcoin is not a currency, but a unit of measure that allows you to interact with the blockchain. The blockchain is a protocol. The internet is a protocol.
AOL and Google were built on top of that protocol. Don't worry so much about what will replace Bitcoin, instead worry about who will replace coinbase? Who will replace bitpay? These are the real analogies. 
Bitcoin currently has the most robust and best supported blockchain. The blockchain is the important thing here, not the coins. 
Also, if bitcoin rises in value, you have to think that any serious holder of BTC could wipe out any new crypto just by buying up a huge amount of them and dumping on the market.

That code is called your public address, it's basically like a po box number, a locker number, or a safe deposit box number.
If you want bitcoins, that is the address that people will send to.
Every public address comes with a private key, which is basically the key that will open the locker/po box/safe deposit box.
Just like a key in the real world, you have to keep this one safe from everyone else otherwise they can steal whatever is inside.

Definitely. Most of the indepedently wealthy people I know who made their money online (ads, websites, bitcoins, etc) just keep some maxed out vanguard accounts.
I think it runs hand in hand with being slightly introverted... distrust of the regular financial advisors, and also not wanting to be out in public talking to people etc. 
The thing you can get with regular advisors is 1. a higher cost but also 2. preferential treatment based on your account size. its all based on what you value more.

That's great news. 
All you need to send coins is the private key. I highly suggest trying a new method of moving the coins. My favorite wallet is electrum. 
Try downloading it, and going to Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Import
It will say something about not being recoverable from seed but that doesn't matter since you are just moving the coins anyways.
Type in the private key and hit import.
If at this step you finally see the coins in your wallet then things are good. From there you can just click the send tab and send the coins wherever you want

Well, a lot of pressure needs to be on your group. People with large amounts of btc have enough in assets already that they should be out 'working' for bitcoins future. 
Go out and get shit done. Make connections happen.
If you view your stash of BTC as a growing asset, then just by going out there and working hard to gain acceptance you will probably add more value to your BTC then getting a real job could ever do for you in the same timespan.
In short: us late adopters allowed you to get rich, now go out and get shit done.

Yea, I don't think i'm hot stuff when it comes to trading either. That's why I stay away. But if the price goes up 10x then I think its pretty safe to sell off and buy lower. If you are into that kind of stuff I mean.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:35:49
I bought 1 BTC at 1,000,000 USD. I am from the future. I used my earnings from investing in OCULUS RIFT to buy that bitcoin.
I don't think it can get that high again though. So I plan to cash out as soon as BTC goes back down to 500 so that I can cut my losses. Then I will invest in DOGECOIN but then I will sell when it reaches 50% of its value as well.
In this way I will trade my money down to the point where I can only afford a bubble gum ball, which I will promptly drop on the groud and watch get run over by a car.

Agreed with your point about bitcoin changing your outlook on life.
For my whole life, I was content to sit in my room. I knew all of the problems of the world, but I didn't know of a way to solve them. I thought that my best bet was to just live as an outsider until I died.
But Bitcoin showed me the power of an idea. A small amount of code can change the world. I mean completely change the world. The implications are amazing. This is way beyond things like Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.
As a result, I am completely and fully engaged in life now. I now understand the power of ideas, and the power of technology. I have opened my mind to all sorts of things that only Bitcoin could have introduced me to - financial things, economic things, political things, etc.
I am at least 3 times more alive than I was before I found Bitcoin. We are on the brink of something major here. The price is irrelevant. I am not sure how to sleep at night anymore. Sometimes I wonder why other people are so content to go about their day to day activities like nothing is happening. 
In any case, the fact that you brought up biology made me remember this post:
Ignore the dogecoin slant, and read it as a thought on all cryptocoins. It's quite a profound post.

I had a target amount as well. I started buying incrementally and there was a huge crash which allowed me to increase my target by a fair amount. 
I'm not sure which way the price is headed, but if I were buying right now, I would just dump all my cash in and then chill. If bitcoin performs as I hope it will, any price under 1k is a good one.
We might slide after some china announcements though.

I doubt someone will crack this from this post. Although brainwallets are insecure, it is usually because people choose passwords that are easily scrapeable from the internet (sentences from books/poems/quotes/songs), or because they are things like normal passwords which are easily bruteforced.
If the brainwallet password is something like "Oranges I like to eat they are pulpy and mmm good also sweet" Then your coins would most likely be safe for the rest of your life. 
I won't lie, i'm trying to find your coins right now, but I probably have a better chance of accidentally finding someone else's wallet than finding yours.

Let's go back in time to the previous bitcoin bubbles and crashes.
When bitcoin was worth CENTS, and then worth 2 dollars, and then worth CENTS again, that's pretty damn volatile isn't it. Oh but its still a a great deal either way.
Ok lets move on. Bitcoin to 20 dollars, and then down to 2 dollars again. Pretty damn volatile, but still a GREAT deal compared to now. 
Next crash. Bitcoin up to 260 and then down to 50. Super super volatile, but if you bought at 260 with all the cash you ever had, you'd still be laughing your way to the bank at this moment. Still a great deal.
Volatility looks smooth when you zoom out
Of course my whole post hinges on the assumption that bitcoin will rise in value over time into the next years. If it crashes to 0 and whatnot then whatevs.

Hi I saw a cool business starting up called BitWall.
What they do is keep track of all payments you receive and then pay out at the end of the day, making only 1 official blockchain transaction. This way people can pay 1 cent etc

@_date: 2013-12-26 22:21:28
Hi, based on your setup this is what I can say:
Your number one concern is to never lose the wallet.dat file, and to keep it encrypted.
You said you have it encrypted with a strong password which is GREAT. No one will be able to crack it. You don't need to do any extra encrypting beyond what you have already done. So that's good.
You should make sure you have multiple backups of the wallet.dat. Some people email themselves copies, put them in the cloud etc. I would rename it first to something innocent sounding.
The next thing you should do after that is keep the password safe. Do you ever have to actually type it in? That would be vulnerable to a keylogger. 
Basically any time you are connected to the internet, there is a chance you could be compromised. To be honest, most bitcoin users don't do much in terms of security. Just encrypt their wallet and nothing happens.
It's usually windows that gets compromised, and they usually dont have encryption.
But for the MOST PARANOID of users, they leave their wallets on OFFLINE computers (cold storage), and for their online computers they use a separate wallet that if lost, wouldn't hurt them.

This is the future of spending money in person:
Vendors nearby will 'broadcast' their public address (which will have a user id at this point, kind of like how wireless routers work).
You then pull up your phone and pick the person you want to send money to, and the amount
Then you 'flick' your thumb (matches the fingerprint) up the screen (like apple gestures) and the money gets sent to them

What I really like about bitcoin in the short term is how much it has taught me about economics/finance/markets etc. I always hated that stuff because I felt like it wasn't for me, like i wasn't in the club. But now I feel like I belong.

I'm afraid that I will have to sleep in defeat tonight. 
I tried hashing and recursive hashing of the OP, using the given hashes as both the brainwallet.org passphrase and/or secret exponent. Nothing.
Tried jumbling up the text as well (revolution, contrarian as hint words) and doing the same. Nothing. 
You say Linguistic Geocaching, which made me think that the text gives a hint to the location, and doesn't give the actual location itself. That's what made me do recursion.
But anyways, maybe I will find the answer in my dream. If not, hopefully someone else finds this post like I did, and gets inspired by my tries so far.

Ah that was a good hint. At least more in line with what I think of when I think riddles etc.
But I am not in tune with this puzzle at all. Probably won't be able to solve it.

This list doesn't really seem to mean that much. The hex value is just a different way of representing the private key. If the hex values are very close together then of course the private keys will be as well. What is important is that there is no way of knowing that by looking at the public keys.
Also, by keeping the hex values so close together, you are basically limiting the amount of possible wallets to a very small number. Whoever used the 'fff...ff' wallet probably made it on purpose via the hex value.

The fact that you called it a 'line of gibberish' is VERY FUCKING SCARY.
Not because I care whether you care, but because you have a huge risking of losing your money if you don't understand which line of gibberish to use.
The best option for you to get started asap is this:
Go to Blockchain.info
sign up for a wallet (links on the top)
then before you do anything, set up two factor authentication (makes you verify a text before you can sign in)
The 'line of gibberish' to send your money to is the PUBLIC ADRESS of your wallet. That is the place to send the coinbase money. It is in big BOLD letters right next to the big QR code (the braille looking thing full of black dots).
If in doubt, first head over to and cash in your karma for a small amount of BTC to test with.
Once all that is done, your coinbase money is relatively safe in your blockchain wallet (coinbase is pretty safe too, but you never know, and as long as your coins are with them, they can take them back for no reason).
Blockchain can't take your coins from you, but because it is an online system, your coins are vulnerable to attack from keyloggers.
After this you have to read up on  (in this order, give up when you feel safe, its not all necessary) :
Public address    
Private key (and why you should NEVER give this to anyone ever)    
Paper wallets + cold storage (the only way to be safe)    
Electrum     
Armory      
BIP32    
BIP38       
Btw, i'm not your kid.

Yes, lots of activity on the blockchain right now. People are either rushing their coins out of storage to sell, or storing coins they just bought on the cheap. 
Who knows which of the two camps is being smarter right now. This stuff is all just so exciting. Look at the power of a great idea (Bitcoin), the economic impact of governmental regulation, and the destructive power of greed and fear. I feel like we are witnessing the lifespan of an entire market in just a few weeks.

Hey I am in the same situation as you. I want to learn how mining really works and I want to take part in it. I don't really want to buy graphics cards or mine alt coins either since I don't care about them.
But the advice you got from nikitos is mainly right. Its much easier to mine altcoins, and you can even get A LOT of them without much investment, and then trade them back into BTC.
But yeah, I just want to be able to say "I mined" in the future. I think that in 10 years that will be a novel thing to say. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:13:36
Too soon junior
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:15:41
So you got the first part down. The second part as well, but you are missing a certain point.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation (some are already lost for good). 
If the 'community is saturated' with bitcoin, where people earn and spend bitcoin as the main form of money, then based on population size alone, each individual bitcoin would have to be massively valuable. 
Supply and demand. 
Right now we are both trying to determine how many people want bitcoins, and how valuable they or the protocol they run on are. 
The price will only go up from here if they are deemed valuable, or if more and more people want them. 
If this happens then the price will not come down as there are less 'buyers-with-fiat'. In fact, it will probably go even higher as fiat becomes less desirable. It makes sense this way - if more people want bitcoins, then the amount of fiat you can get for bitcoins would increase! 
Meaning the buying power of coins goes up, and the buying power of fiat goes down.
Bitcion may reach and equilibrium with certain fiats, or it may render them useless. In certain cases you might see a complete migration from fiat X to bitcoin, meaning that over time, the price of bitcoin relative to fiat X would only ever increase until the fiat ceases to have value.
But this is all only if bitcoin is adopted and deemed valuable. If the opposite happens then it will go back down to a low value and fiat will remain.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:00:34
If we can separate Bitcoin the investment from Bitcoin the technology then we are both right. Not that I said anything was certain in my previous post. I think that bitcoin the investment will go up in the long term, but nothing in life is certain.

Really cool presentation. I went into it pretending that I knew nothing about bitcoin and came out the other side with a good primer on bitcoin.
I think the magic of bitcoin is when you get hands on though. The real time transaction will be key. Let them look at the blockchain.info realtime transactions too. Also they might really enjoy seeing that 150 MM dollar transfer made by coinbase earlier this month (for no fees!).
Probably good to hint at the future of bitcoin as well like colored coins, contracts, ownership proofs on the blockchain etc.
Also a quick snippet about the past wouldnt hurt (show other failed e-currencies - why bitcoin isn't a weak first contender, but a mature successor in a line of failed currencies)
Best of luck!

Really cool. 2 dollars a week isn't bad either. I mean in terms of BTC it's probably easier to find other ways to buy coins but then you miss out on all the cool nerdy stuff that goes with mining.
I don't think I would be motivated by the profit though, maybe more by the ability in 50 years to say something like 'yes I mined bitcoins even though now it's all done by huge supercomputers that are kept in outer space/underwater'
I think i'll try mining sometime in the future then.

1. Coinbase is not the most efficient way to get bitcoins. The most efficient way is for someone to send you some. If buying then you have to either buy from a person or from a company or an exchange. The latter two require KYC AML etc which is why it gets slightly awkward. ATM's may come in the future. 
2. ok? don't do any buys or sells based on fear or elation. 
3. You used coinbase. If you used an exchange it is instant. Or if you bought locally its instant. 
4. Alternatives are exchanges (you will get eaten alive) or locally. These are new businesses so yes its a bit slow.
5. Dogecoin is a joke. Its like a toy version of bitcoin. Monopoly money. There is a future there. It's a very bright future, but not one including real money and riches. Probably just including tips on twitch.tv and 4chan.
6. When all the coins are mined then miners will mine for transaction fees (number of transactions if bitcoin is alive in 2140 will be large supposedly)

Well i've been reading threads on this sub from months and years ago. A lot of people were very crazy sounding when they said bitcoin would be at 3000 by 2015. A lot of people were crazy sounding when they said that bitcoin could hit 1000 'in 3-4 years'. 
No one knows where this thing is going. But if it is going to go, then it will probably be too fast. I don't think that there is such a thing as slow stable (linear) growth of a new technology. It's either accepted and adopted or not. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:35:07
I can't either... still waiting on the deposit from coinbase into my tiny credit union.. damn you thanksgiving. 
If I bought when I wanted I coulda had prices around 900-1000. If its still there then I will be happy still :)
Localcoins is looking like an alright alternative but I can't depend on it forever, so i'm hoping to get coinbase up and running..
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:17:05
Ah if I hover over those lines it basically explains how many BTC can be moved in either direction before the price changes that amount.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:22:52
Yes you are right. If big players ever became interested in coming into a small market, they would either
* Buy in while the price is low, or
* Create a crash to lower the price
And they wouldn't buy on the market. It would be buying directly from large holders at nice prices. 
But I think any big players that wanted to get in have been in, and smartly got out near 1000. Wall street has been toying with Bitcoin since 2010. 
This crash doesn't need any great explanations. China is cracking down, so they are dropping lots of coins.

Seems to me like the sentiment has simply shifted from euphoric to doubtful. Many people who are sitting on large gains and many who are trying to cut losses are selling because right now, selling 'feels' right. 
I think it's all fallout from the china stuff. Domino effect. 
Seems to be lots of market manipulation going on as well.
There are still tons of huge buys going down too. I'm long term bullish. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:17:36
People are always looking for safe places to store their money. If bitcoin ever comes to be seen as safe by the majority of those with wealth, and if this mindset coincides with a loss in faith of the economy then Bitcoin would see some influx of money. 
For an example. Right now the markets are very high (relative to all time), and bitcoin is very low (relative to potential and total cap). Imagine if they start moving in opposite directions. It wouldn't be too hard to imagine some leak from the markets into bitcoin instead of straight back to gold and silver, or other more traditionally safer assets. 
I don't think that's too far of a stretch.
But I am about to stretch.
A possibility I can imagine is one in which a the falling economy is actually lifted up in the long term by a move towards bitcoin. So during the transfer stages things will look bleak for those who aren't invested.
Hope I didn't go full retard on that last paragraph.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:41:16
It takes about an hour to confirm the transaction on the blockchain, but the bitcoin should show up immediately
that might depend on the wallet itself though. For electrum and blockchain.info (the only two I have experience with) it will show up right away as unconfirmed.
Please double check the address you sent to.
Also type in the address of your COINBASE wallet into blockchain.info and look at the transactions from it.

Yeah that's as safe as it gets as long as you generate the paper wallet offline. Just make sure you have a safe way of keeping the paper wallets stored so that you can use them when you need them in X amount of years.
I'd also advise looking into bip38 encryption on those paper wallets. It makes it so that anyone who finds the paper wallet can't do anything without having a password

If you go to the bitcoin subreddit and search for posts from 5-8 months ago, there are a bunch of usernames there that do not post anymore. I think they silently bowed out of the conversation.
I think that over time people get driven out by the vocal newcomers. I know that I will probably stop posting so much over time. I'll probably try to put my energy into something more positive that either helps the cryptocurrency community (if there is a long term future for this stuff) or focus on stuff for myself.
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:41:06
Interesting statistics. I don't have much knowledge on the topic of keyloggers.
Just to throw another method out there - Some people store the majority of their coins on electrum set up via a one time USB boot into linux live. 
This means that the data showing the way to the bitcoins coins dont even exist on any computer anywhere. 
You would have to safeguard the seed though.
The only way to lose your coins in that case would be if someone found your seed, or if someone brute forced your seed or private key ( which is an unlikely event ).
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:41:41
Sweeping coins means this:
Say you create an electrum wallet.
address1 - 1 BTC    
address2 - 1 BTC    
address3 - 0    
address4 - 3 BTC    
Now, in order to get those coins out of those wallets, you only need the private keys. You don't need anything else. 
So you can recreate the wallet on an offline instance of electrum, and grab a private key. 
You then put that private key into any wallet of your choice that has a sweep function (which puts all BTC from the old address into a new one).
You can completely bypass electrum servers this way.
The downside would be that you can never know how much BTC are in your wallets if you strictly stay offline (no way to read the blockchain). That's where the master public key comes in handy.

Dogecoin is amazing but bitcoin is not over. The hype days may be over. Things are getting tough, but this is just the beginning for Bitcoin if it is to become successful. If it will fail then this will be a good starting point for that as well. It is nowhere near over.
The reason people use dogecoin is because the community is good, it is funny, and they are cheap to get, and some even believe it will make them rich (which I have my doubts about). 
If I could make a prediction on the future of dogecoin I would say that it would be used irrespective of its value as a sort of 'online monopoly money'. All the benefits of cryptocurrency without having to trade in things of actual value for it.

having an encrypted wallet.dat is still super safe (I could post mine on the frontpage of reddit and expect to keep my coins if the password is good) but it is vulnerable to keyloggers and stuff, thats why offline is good.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:15:49
It's as secure as your password.
This means that if your password is very strong, then you could by all accounts literally hand your encrypted key to everyone in the world and expect your coins to never be taken.
I'm pretty sure there's no need to layer cryptography (bip38 key + truecrypt). It's something like wearing two condoms as far as an analogy.

Yes my original point was that using both forms of protection was unnecessary and actually likely to make things worse (forgetting a password to just one of them will lose you your coins).

If bitcoin is widely used, then the price would have to get higher because there would need to be 'room' for all ongoing transactions. 
If bitcoins were worth a small amount of money, say 100 million dollars, someone who wanted to buy an 8 million dollar house in bitcoin would need almost 10% of all bitcoins! That's just not feasible. 
So if it were to be widely used, the price would need to be much higher to support people. Think of it as bandwidth. Not denoted by speed, but by value. More people = more value needed.

Check this out.
I have [Electrum]( (&lt;- Click there)
It is a lightweight wallet client that generates a seed of 12 words (paradise tropical beach sandy maragarita, etc) which you can use to access your coins at any time.
Using electrum, you never need a wallet backup (unless you import private keys). All you need to back up is the seed. This means that you generate an electrum seed offline on a temporary USB OS.
This means that as soon as you boot off the computer, all traces of electrum are gone. As long as you keep the seed safe, NO ONE can get to your coins, even if they steal your computer. (The only way is if they guess your private keys somehow).
You can then import something known as the master public key to watch your balances from many computers.
Now to solve the problem of easy accessibility, just keep a wallet on something like blockchain.info where you keep your daily spending amount. Enough to use, but little that if you lose it, you won't care.
But the wallet does have a fallback -&gt; it is deterministic, meaning that it uses the seed to generate all wallets that you can ever want (which is why you need no backups). [In this model, giving out both your master public key and a private key to any address could compromise all of your wallets.](
For this reason I would never advise Electrum to someone running the wallet in a joint manner (business, online groups, family, roommates, etc)

Being both an early adopter and a detractor would put you into a very small group I would guess. 
People have made more money on things that were less useful.
Some would argue that, ironically, the ability of the BitCoins to be taxed/surveilled is what will allow them to excel (if that is what you were getting at). 
If the public adopts it, or large players/businesses that are in the public eye, I doubt they would suddenly shift to XCoin - too much effort to keep changing technologies.

How do you like coinbase for spending vs blockchain? I've never tried holding on coinbase long term. It makes sense for me though, to easily get instant coins from my CC, and spend them from there. 
I may try it out, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:19:38
It is very solid advice, the only problem with it is that it would have been wrong if posted at any point before the december crash. What makes it right now?
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:05:39
Are you on android? I'm still going with the assumption that iOS doesn't have any usable bitcoin apps
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:50:10
You should take the wallet and import it into bitcoin-qt client. 
It is wallet.dat right?
If so then do what I said above, it should show a balance. You might have to let it sync.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:08:30
I feel dirty scrounging for other peoples money :) Its a small rush though
I don't know what i'd do if I actually found something.. leave it alone probably but I hope this doesnt damage bitcoin as a whole

I've never used usenet, but it gave birth to [**this**]( so I will take your word on it.
As far as forums vs reddit for discussions, I will agree that the linearity of forums makes it easier for a conversation to naturally flow in a forward direction, with all information available to all participants. But it also makes for unwieldy reading when threads get long.
As far as free wheeling internet communication goes... if someone builds something great then people will use it so... well I better learn to code.

It seems like you have a general idea, but then why are you asking if you did something wrong?
Are you having buyers remorse? I saw someone drop 500K USD at 1200 USD per coin a week ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:58:57
Your thoughts are all great. Many though will pooh pooh you based on both the obviousness and short-sightedness of your observations.
My main criticism is that it seems like you lack long term vision.
A more productive method would be to outline a solution to any of the problems you have mentioned.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:41:42
No one knows what is going to happen. Make a decision you will be happy with no matter what happens.

You don't need to use Bitcoin-qt (it downloads the whole blockchain).
Try multibit or electrum instead. They aren't online wallets, and they don't need the whole blockchain.

Sounds like you invested without any idea of what you are getting into. I suggest you read up on bitcoins immediately otherwise you will either
1) Sell too soon on the way up
2) Sell too late on the way down 
This isn't a get rich quick scheme. It's an interesting piece of technology that has implications that create real value. Read up.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:28:49
I'm not sure where the fear is coming from. Inflation doesn't magically put money into the pockets of the average person. It helps them lose lots of power over time. I'm sitting here watching as my groceries are doubling in price over a few year period. it's digusting.
Meanwhile, people are tipping BTC like crazy, spending it on lots of things .it's really exciting to be around bitcoin right now. I don't doubt that a select few are going to be VERY RICH, but I don't really care either because it's already that way and worse so imo.

Is sha256ing the whole OP the correct first step, or did you jumble the words up before doing anything
I read all the hints you left so far. 'all you need is in the first post' 'you need everything in the first post' etc. Guessing I need every single word in there, in some order.
Also mad hatter style dictates I start at the beginning and end at the end, which to me means keep it simple, so i just copied and pasted the whole thing for the first step, but nothing yet :)

OH yeah that went over my head. Yeah there is a lot of brainpower out there. That lends some credibility to the "Satoshi is a team of people" theory actually. 
I wonder if we will ever know. It seems insane to imagine some guy sitting in a room alone inventing .. actually no, no it really doesn't. This isn't the type of thing a team could invent. It takes one uninhibited person.

I mean i'm sure I could BS some things as I am self taught in most things (I feel like most people are these days), and have started my own online failures
but i dont have any "real" experience to put on there.

Just wait a few months.
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:55:34
That's interesting. Did it not give you an option of where to sweep the coin into?
That must be why people said never to import 'watch only' wallets into blockchain that you don't control.
At least you didn't lose your coins by 'watch only'ing some other wallet that wasn't yours.

Na, I found it by hand. I mean yeah its still possible but there's no way to know.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:10:59
Yes but you will also be sitting on them during crashes as they lose value. If you can manage the risk without putting peoples jobs on the line, and while keeping your mental sanity, then that's fine. 
I really think that bitcoin users (during this early stage) need to be through at least one major crash before they know what they are in for.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:01:20
I've already learned more from the amount I put into BTC than from all of my college tuition combined. Money was well spent so far. No matter what happens.

Every old person i've spoken to about bitcoin has loved the idea! They get it, but I wouldn't let them go hands on, you are correct.
As far as getting them comfortable with bitcoin, it will take people much more skilled than me at design/coding etc.
But one thing is for sure, if old people can completely take over facebook, then they can start to use bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:33:24
The gold/shovels analogy was good a year ago for mining vs selling machines (the BFL fiasco).
It doesn't really hold anymore. I mean yes, the exchanges are making good money, coinbase is making good money, but it's not like I only have a certain percent chance of 'finding' a bitcoin when I go to buy one.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:09:46
So how do you feel about the future of Bitcoin now?
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:01:31
What's funny is that the people with the most coins (and the most to gain) are the biggest spenders. Buying Lambos, huge houses, selling to investment funds.

Don't worry i'm right there with you man. I feel a cultural revolution brewing. I really do feel it in my bones. I'm ok with losing it all because I don't want to live in a world where Bitcoin didn't work out. If it does go back to zero i'll just give up on life and walk the gay earth.

Well their API isn't secure and I have a feeling that they know it.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:49:02
Yes you could do that as well. 
The electrum wallet just uses a seed to populate a list of publicaddress:privatekey pairs.
As soon as the wallet is made you could write down all of the public addresses and check them on blockchain.info whenever you like.
I personally use something called a master public key, which is basically an electrum wallet that has no private keys. It can view the transactions and balances of all of the addresses in your wallet though.
One thing to be cautious of: NEVER give out your master public key and a private key. Using just these two numbers, someone can access your whole wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:08:15
Indeed it is. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:16:58
Yeah that's kind of the attitude I have as well. I don't want it to fail but if it does then oh well.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:34:30
Hi im pretty sure what you are describing is the 'instant verification'.
You can still connect via deposit/ACH which means you will only have to give out your account number and routing number.
I used that method recently. It took about a week (holidays). 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:42:21
Yes coinbase price follows Bitstamp
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:08:49
Yes, that hash is the public address for your wallet. 
Here it is: 
What do you mean 'if it works'? 
BTW all wallets have a public key and a private key. You should under no circumstances ever NEVER ever give your private key out or even type it online or anything. 
The private key gives control to all funds in the wallet. The public key just allows people to see your wallet, and send stuff to it.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:15:56
Just a guess
Too small of a fee
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:44:31
My wise opinion is that you should follow your feelings and not think too hard. Watch star wars a few times first or something. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:35:49
I see. The dollar cost averaging technique is a really good one. I think that's what I was using when I bought twice instead of spending all at once. With hindsight though I would have bought with everything when someone said "BTC is dead! (during first china dump)" instead of buying when someone on this subreddit said "its a new paradigm!! (gold parity)".
Live and learn.
I like your philosophy on the tiered investments. I don't own a house so I probably just have two tiers, and bitcoin is definitely the risky one. I have big hopes for it but as it stands now if it does burn I will not have to change anything about my life even one bit. I was considering putting much more in but I think this thread changed that.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:48:58

I base my numbers on the history of this subreddit, bitcoin, and on the adoption rates of new technologies.
People sounded CRAZY if they said bitcoin would hit 1000 by 2014 just a few months ago. 
The news out of china right now is, you know someone just called it a black swan event, but instead of losing my shit over it, i'm just gonna look back and see what happened at 300. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:38:07
If they are worth that much then there would be huge markets in place for exchanging BTC into whatever currency you desire, assuming you can't just use the BTC for whatever you need.
It might even be as easy as giving the BTC to a bank and walking away with cash. I'm sure banks would use bitcoin for overseas transfers/remittances, so it wouldn't be a big deal to them to exchange BTC for cash. 
Maybe. 
Probably not though.
WHo knows.
Speculation is lame.

If any alt coins wants to succeed it has to do it on its own, and that means dealing with haters and the pains of success.
In 3 years no one is going to care if someone made an anti 'crypto coin X' thread. 
That said i am currently hoarding dogecoin i believe it to be the coin of the future because bitcoin sucks because of the fact that its not dogecoin.

@_date: 2013-11-25 17:37:48
Yup. As someone with a very small background in marketing I am glad that this discussion is already happening. Money called a 'satoshi' will have a hard time gaining traction because of the way it sounds (for various reasons like racism, syllables, cultural barriers, etc). 
Bitcoin is a cool name because it fuses some things that we are already familiar with and creates a new idea (Bit and coin). I think the same will have to happen for the smaller denominations.
I don't think we should change the name of the actual coin itself to a satoshi either because of backwards compatibility issues as stated (its such a strong argument that I don't even think I need to add to it - all google hits are for 'bitcoin', don't want to confuse people, too critical).
But the smaller denominations should not be based on scientific notation and units etc. I have sat through countless science classes in public school, private school, high end uni, community college, it doesn't matter what type of school it is, people have HUGE problems with units.
We just need a better name for the smaller denominations, and I agree that they will be more used than the whole coins themselves.

@_date: 2013-11-25 18:16:35
This discussion popped up in the 'era of the cheap coin is over' thread. I stated that using scientific units would be bad because people easily get confused when trying to convert. Also it sounds a bit too nerdy IMO. We really need to get the general population in on this.
That's what I think about the issue anyways. I mean things like Facebook and Twitter; imagine if they were called something nerdier.. would people have used them?
This is the part where I come up with awesome nerdy version names for Facebook and Twitter, which then makes you chuckle and agree with me. But i'm not good at that, so I will end my post here.
edit: this person had a cool idea - 
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:20:04
I'm actually pretty worried that I already had 'my time'. The future looks pretty meh to me right now. I don't see any clear winners except for Bitcoin ,and bitcoin is really questionable with the whole regulation thing. It's gonna be a pretty conservative year for me I think.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:10:28
I didn't get the story until I put myself in the shoes of the mafia guy. So what is being said is that even if you do make the absolute CORRECT CHOICE based on current info, unexpected things could completely change the market and lose you all of your money if you don't diversify. 
This is probably why those who go all in are usually short term rather than long? Is this incorrect?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:33:05
Japan is very conservative is it not? They want to be the ones to come up with bitcoin, not the ones to follow it. Japanese pride? Or am I talking out of my ass.
Someone needs to tell them about Satoshi-kun
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:56:20
The bitcoin is a hugely volatile and risky thing to put your money into. Never emotionally buy or sell. 
If you do put money in, have an exit plan/strategy. 
Try not to put too much money in. It's stressful. Bitcoin is a very interesting technology, and it's very easy to drink the kool-aid on it. I think if you put a very small amount in the game you will start to learn very fast. Don't blow your wad on day 1.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:45:40
Those links don't really say anything useful. They are just saying that all investors should seek to maximize profit while minimizing risk.

Catchy names are more viral though. BTC needs more penetration right now. A lot of work is being done just by the amazing nature of the charts. Hopefully it keeps up.

Cool, glad to hear. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:59:35
People like paper wallets because then you never have to worry about what servers are doing what, or what programs have what weaknesses etc. 
I personally am not a fan of paper wallets because they don't take advantage of the main thing that bitcoin was founded on, which is encryption and decentralization.
If you do decide to use paper wallets, I would bip38 them.
But you have to find the method that feels right for you, and make sure you do it well. Coin safety is huge. Lotta thefts happen every day, mostly the online coins though (coinbase, btc-e, gox, blockchain.info).

Now, I am young and dumb, so walk me through this but:
Compound interest seems to useful for two groups: those without much money, who have no interest in investing but want growth, and those with 100MM + of cash, who can outpace even good investors by simply letting interest do its thing.
For those in the middle, I think that diversification and risk aversion are actually the keys to mediocrity. Say I put most of my money in an account and let it compound over time. By the time I retire, I might be looking at a decent nest egg. That's cool, but I could have been 4-5 good trades away from the same amount of money without a 40 year wait.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:46:53
Transaction CONFIRMATIONS take some time. This is the amount of time it takes for a block to be filled with transactions like this:
block 334245    
[    
Transaction 1    
Transaction 2    
Transaction 3   
....    
Transaction 100     
]     
And then confirmed by a miner. (caveat is I think the block is capped once confirmed and not before)
Even though this takes time, the transaction is broadcast immediately across the whole network. If you send someone money , they know right away.
As far as trust, a double spend can be done by a malicious user. But as far as I know, this still loses you your coins, as you can't pick which block will get confirmed (meaning you cant choose which transaction goes through). But you would need a large portion of the mining power to pull this off.
I supposed a situation can occur in which a user always broadcasts every spend both to a seller and back to themselves. I hope someone will be able to help me understand that (plz reply)
In the future people will make and accept sales based on the broadcast time and not the confirmation time. The exception will be very large movements of BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:18:48


Yes, if someone decided to broadcast 4-5 malicious blockchains I think there is a potential for something bad to happen. I don't know the specifics or even completely understand the technology, but I think it would be safe to rule nothing out. Especially with the recent NSA leaks.


Paper wallets can be encrypted, you are right. Bip38. I think its a pretty new technology. I think some paper wallets are out there that aren't even encrypted.
Decentralized though? If decentralization means not trusting a third party then you are right again. You can make your own.
But I was referring to having the wallet be safe from any local disaster (in the cloud so to speak). Maybe there is another word for that.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:53:26
If you look hard enough, people are leaving BTC in little 'easter egg' brainwallets. I say we make a BTC easter egg hunt at the proper time next year. Should be fun to hide private keys here and there.
I have to say though that the recent run up has put a slight halt on that behavior
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:47:45

If you still have the private address where the bitcoins are/were then the coins are still under your control.
In order to use them again just use blockchain or electrum to sweep the coins out of that wallet.
You can probably do something similar in qt but I don't like clients that require the blockchain.

At the time of the run-up the subreddit was full of activity and positive posts about bitcoin. Glamorizing the future, talking about changing the world, making everyone millionaires, etc. It was very eerie. 
Yea it looks like 100 was a fine price that people were ok with. The whole gold parity thing really shook the markets though. 
Well I think that selling is coming from many places. Mostly china though, since they were the ones that propped up BTC in the first place. I think the sharp sell off doesn't say much about the intrinsic value of bitcoin, rather I think it is just people in China getting rid of bitcoins while they are in a profit, and before the government completely cracks down on it.
I have spent some time around asian culture, and this whole thing seems to me like they are slowly giving more and more strict warnings that are all hinting at the banning of BTC. 
The real questions moving forward are:
1) Can the rest of the buyers replace the chinese investments which are being lost?
2) Will other governments follow?
I bought some BTC during the run up a month ago. Only as much as I was willing to completely lose. Looks like I might be in the negative if this selloff tonight is a big one.

I don't have anything against things that are nerdy at all. Didn't mean it to come off that way. In fact, I don't even think you can call something as simple as scientific units nerdy, whatever the word nerd even means anymore, but I do think that the general population would view it in that manner.

Yea I know exactly who you are talking about. Interestingly enough, this subreddit feels like a ghost town compared to the thanksgiving run up. Wonder where everyone disappeared to. 
Pretty cool that you have been following since June. I guess that means you were around for the whole bubble (maybe not done popping yet though). Why didn't you buy in earlier, were you not comfortable yet?
I think right now is a great time to be around Bitcoin because of how political this whole thing is getting. It's a huge learning experience. I think people have finally realized that it's not a money printing machine. Some of the early adopters have done well for themselves, but the whole "we are still early adopters, Bitcoin is going to the moon" thing was very played out.
A thought I was having recently was that if Bitcoin wasn't money, but instead just another technology like Facebook/Twitter maybe it actually would have gone to the moon this time. Because of how disruptive it is to current systems, and because of greed, I think that it's growth will be seriously hampered over time.
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:02:53
China news said that Bitcoin can't be used as a currency or to trade for goods. But that it was perfectly legal to buy and own an an individual basis.

Being well established in an industry usually makes one blind to new ideas.

@_date: 2013-12-14 15:57:17

You can buy via coinbase if you want, that is one of the many methods. You can also buy locally from other people for anonymity. (localbitcoins.com)
Linking your bank account is fine, but it will leave a paper trail. I don't mind it so I use it. Your bank may care. Depends on the bank, which do you use?
Coverting to USD means selling your bitcoins. It can happen with one click, depending on where you do it. Or you could sell it in person to other people. You can sell on coinbase and they deposit into your account. 
Can't really address your last point... Not too sure on that myself.

@_date: 2013-12-26 21:27:54
Yea that's true and I didn't even think of that. It's not like all of a sudden you will only be dealing with BTC. I would say go for it. Running a business that accepts BTC is one of the most legitimate ways of acquiring them. 
Some vendors mitigate their risk by coverting to USD at the end of the day. There are payment processors that do this for you (Bitpay, Coinbase). Always an option to explore down the line.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:01:48
Well, based on past events, we are due for a pretty substantial crash, followed by a few months of relative silence/low-hype. But the question is, have we not reached critical mass yet? 
Time will tell. If it does crash this time, I would be happy for the extra purchasing power of my american dollhairs. 
But i've been watching the trading a bit. Even when someone sells huge volume and drops the price, 20 more tiny buys come in to make up the difference... so right now it's looking like a david(s) vs goliath kind of thing. We just need to spread the word to more people. I'm actually thinking about going to a bitcoin conference just to see what people are trying to do about this, and I hate meeting online people in real life.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:54:09
RIP To the Crapcoins.
Just for fun I was browsing posts from that crash in this subreddit. Someone had thousands of coins and said
"I put my whole life savings into these coins with dreams of being a millionaire, and now i'm losing money and it's time to get out and apologize to my family."
If only he had waited. 
I hope he is doing ok, or has forgotten about BTC altogether. Must be the worst.

Shorting LTC basically means making money on the failure of LTC. To do this more easily, just buy BTC. When LTC fails, where do you think that money is going to end up? In BTC.
That is only if you think LTC will fail. Some think it will follow BTC up to the moon. In that case, to short it you would need to find a way to borrow some and sell them back during dips.

How much do you want to buy?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:13:18
Yes I understand your proposed method of attack. Pick a private key, determine the hex value, and through simple range scanning, check some number of wallets. It's like throwing darts though. How many wallets can you scan over period of time X, and how does this compare to the total number of wallets possible in the protocol? 
I once had it explained to me that the number of possible wallets is equal to all the grains of sand on the amount of earths that you would get if first every grain of sand on this earth became a new earth. It is not even possible for my mind to think to that large of a number.
The best thing you could do is go find some wallets and steal the cash from them as a proof of concept. Right now it sounds like you just found 'ffff....ff' which is a novelty wallet, and found that electrum puts related wallets in close hex ranges to one another. Based on the sheer number of wallets possible in the protocol, this tiny range of values can be considered to be a single discrete wallet. Having wallets hex, hex+1, hex+2, hex+3, and hex+4 does not make it even the tiniest bit more likely that your wallets will be found.

Yeah, one of my good friends who has a good sense for these things said the same thing. My counter to that though is that this is a global market. All the rules probably went out the window with this thing.

Most people use this resource to create their brainwallets. They simply type in a phrase and it creates a wallet (by simply hashing the phrase, and using the hash as the hex value of the private key of the wallet).

There are certain funds acquiring BTC now you can find some of them on this subreddit. The name SecondMarket gets tossed around a lot. Not sure if they are still buying.
Of course there are other methods like finding private investors and getting someone to set up the deal for you but I am not of much help in that regard..

If the exponential growth keeps up then we can expect this much sooner than seems possible.
Of course, now that I have my OWN money in Bitcoin, I fully expect it to become worthless and literally explode my computers, catching my house on fire. I don't think I deserve a good investment.
But I have to add that bitcoin so far has been 'dipping under' the trendline, and then bubbling over. It moves in waves. So things might look bleak for a few months.

The beauty of bitcoin is that you don't have to 'connect' your address to anything. You have to buy some bitcoins first, and then send them to your address. It's like sending a text message to an address, but instead of containing words, the text contains money!
So you have to buy some, then you can transfer them. It will ask you where to send them, that's when you paste in your address
By bitcoin app do you mean blockchain.info? Where is your wallet made?
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:37:56

Bitcoin was created by librarians because regular fiat money is too loud, the physical coins I mean. They clank around in your pocket and are just really annoying especially when you are trying to read a book.

The popular Bitcoin client software from bitcoin.org implements a "full" Bitcoin node: It can carry out all the duties of the Bitcoin P2P system, it isn't simply a "client". One of the principles behind the operation of full Bitcoin nodes is that they don't assume that the other participants have followed the rules of the Bitcoin system. During synchronization, the software is processing historical Bitcoin transactions and making sure for itself that all of the rules of the system have been correctly followed.
In normal operation, after synchronizing, the software should use a hardly noticeable amount of your computer's resources.
When the wallet client program is first installed, its initial validation requires a lot of work from your computer's hard disk, so the amount of time to synchronize depends on your disk speed and, to a lesser extent, your CPU speed. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or so. On a slow computer it could take more than 40 hours of continuous synchronization, so check your computer's power-saving settings to ensure that it does not turn its hard disk off when unattended for a few hours. You can use the Bitcoin software during synchronization, but you may not see recent payments to you until the client program has caught up to the point where those transactions happened.
If you feel that this process takes too long, you can download a pre-synchronized blockchain from  Alternatively, you can try an alternative "lite" client such as Multibit or a super-light client like electrum, though these clients have somewhat weaker security, are less mature, and don't contribute to the health of the P2P network.

Yea, I am as concerned as you are about safety - and I understand the powers that are out there with massive botnets etc.
As far as making a brainwallet that is powered by an electrum seed - I think that having an offline electrum could be just that.
You would never have to connect to the electrum servers if you didn't want to... you could just use the offline program to make the wallet, and then send bitcoins to it.
As soon as you are ready to access the funds, instead of connecting to the servers, you could sweep the coins into any other wallet of your choice (if you long term hold, newer and better technology may exist by the time you want to touch your coins).

Currently I am blinded by bitcoin. Pretty sure I have developed tunnel vision.
But in the past, especially with tech related stuff, I have been able to say "this will be huge" plent of times and be right. Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, all the household names really.
But it extends past that. I can hear a song and know if it will be a hit or not. I can see a movie and know if it will be huge or not. I feel like i'm just connected to culture right now. I don't know how long it will last.
I'm not some super hip-cool person either. I wear shoddy clothes, drive a dirty car, have a terrible haircut etc. But I swear I am plugged in by some sense of the word.

@_date: 2013-12-26 23:18:53
If you are cashing out a small amount localbitcoins might be better since you can charge higher prices.
If you are cashing out a larger amount like 10 bitcoins to 50 then coinbase would be fine. They wire directly to your bank for a fee.
I would advise to keep an excel file with all your transactions just so if the IRS comes knocking you have the info. I wouldn't advise trying to dodge the tax man with this stuff, its very trackable in most cases. Especially if you use coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:28:08
The limit is reached in 2140. If bitcoin is still alive at that point in time then it will be so heavily used that transaction fees will pay more than enough for miners to keep mining as competitively as possible.

@_date: 2013-12-31 23:55:30
I will also say that now all you have to do is make sure you never lose the seed. That's the main point with electrum.
Some people use TrueCrypt on a text file and store it in gmail and stuff. Other people just memorize. Other people write it down and store it in safe places.
I would say this though, if you decide to store it in a bank, scramble it in a way that only you know the correct order.
Also if you do use truecrypt, name the file something dumb that is in no way associated with bitcoin.
Encryption is safe though. People have purposefully put their encrypted wallets and paper wallets on here as a test, and the coins stayed safe.

Yes, this is one time where buying the 'stock' of the company is the same as adopting the technology.
In previous bubbles, historically speaking, even as disruptive technologies went on to be very important and successful (railroad, radio), stock in companies could still crash due to people cashing out, and speculation. 
In this case, holding the coin is basically saying, 'I am part of this technology'. If bitcoin is successful there might be a lack of the post bubble crash. No need to cash out of bitcoin. 
But one of the first things you learn about bubbles is that every time a bubble is happening, the first thing people will say is that 'this time is different'.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:27:02

Yea. The problem with putting in life savings is that it worked for everyone right up until this crash. So the idea started to look like it was even decent. 
Of course you know, I think people are finally learning to respect the markets. The best position to be right now is a casual observer. I think a lot were hoping that Bitcoin was going to be their ticket to a better life. And I have no clue whether or not that will happen. It has crashed and recovered before of course. China leaving is a big deal though, and I don't think we are going to be 'alright' as a community for a while.

1,000 sounds pretty high for a coin, but most will say the potential for growth is huge. Maybe in 5 years people will literally kill themselves for not investing now. Wow that was really somber. Anyways..
Don't invest in the other coins just because they are cheap. Do it if you believe they have some merit. People who held bitcoin when it was cheap did so because of the underlying technology.

There's just too many private keys out there for you to find a used wallet. 
There are some crazy analogies:
1. How many possible bitcoin wallets are there? If you take every grain of sand on the earth, and then turned each of those grains of sand into a new earth, and then you added ALL OF THOSE earths up and took all of the grains of sand from ALL OF THEM, you would now have something close to all the bitcoin wallets.
2. If you took every single person that every lived on earth, and said that they each made 1000 bitcoin wallets, then you turned each one of those wallets into a molecule, trying to find one of those wallets would be like finding a molecule in something the size of the milky way galaxy.

There is the first public note ever in the blockchain though.. by satoshi himself. To read it , convert the hex to ascii

Branching out is usually done by miners and those who know how to daytrade. They branch out and then when the altcoin reaches a very high price, they trade back into Bitcoins. 
Litecoin is gaining some ground on its own, but I think that for every 1 dollar you could put into it, you would be better served putting it into bitcoin.

Ah I see your question. No the worst time to invest in bitcoins recently seems like it was a week or so ago (1200 USD -&gt; 500 USD). There was a big crash because of news from China.
Right now seems like a good time to Invest because the market is stable, and you are in under 1000 USD, which I believe to be quite cheap compared to where Bitcoin could end up. 
But the market could take a huge dip at any time. Why? Because most of the traders are just trying to make a quick buck and will react violently to the tiniest bit of bad news.

I haven't heard too much about that wallet. Most people are using one called Mycelium , however since its just a cellphone wallet I would suggest to never keep too much money on it incase the phone is lost etc

Electrum can be safe to use for long term storage if you choose to do the offline method.
I personally have this method.
I created my electrum wallet on a computer that has never been on the internet. I used a usb boot, had electrum on there and created my seed, and exported the public watch key.
I can check my balance now from an online computer, but my private keys dont exist on any device anywhere. So no matter what the servers do, my coins are safe. 
There are other clients though, like Armory and Multibit, which I would suggest you look into if electrum isn't seeming like a good choice to you.

I just want to say that you are an amazing, amazing person for not stealing freely accessible bitcoins. I too have had thoughts of sweeping easy brainwallets, but I just have to remember how it feels to be stolen from. That sinking feeling. I don't want anyone else to feel that way, so I don't steal from them.
That is a lot of coin. I suggest you send a small amount to that wallet saying something like "your password is compromised, please move your coins ASAP" and hope for the best.
As a community we need to make it clear that brainwallets are NOT A GOOD PLACE TO PUT YOUR MONEY.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:23:59
Ah I see. 
Mentally I see a lot of potential in Bitcoin, and not as much in other places. I may need to open my eyes. Tunnel vision is probably what kept me from finding bitcoin in 2010/11. Can't repeat that mistake.
As far as where my funds are currently allocated, BTC is a single digit percentage.

Went through my first crash the past week or so. It was .. well it made me stop being greedy. Little stomach drops here and there. Didn't touch my coins at all. 
But I do only have in what i'm willing to lose forever and not care about. 
At this point i'm just gonna hold my coins and let the markets do whatever they want. These drops and bubbles won't matter in the end. I mean, just zoom out on the chart, the previous bubbles already barely matter.

Hi, here is part one of my reply:
The encryption you used is enough. There is no need to use truecrypt now.
Using multiple layers of encryption in that manner is actually looked down upon because you run the risk of locking yourself out. 
Using a few USB sticks to backup the wallet is fine. But if you lose them, or they fail, you are screwed. What if there is flood/fire/burgulary etc?
That is something for you to decide on your own of course. Don't let me sway you either way. But think that you may also need to protect the coins FROM YOURSELF.

Quit looking at numbers and trust your gut. Sounds like you already made that mistake once and haven't learned from it. 
But don't come running to me if it goes to 0. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:03:09
Well said. 
So to simplify? It's like saying that there are many more numbers between 1,000,000 and 9,999,999 (7 digits) then there are between 1 - 999,999 ( 1 digit all the way up to right before 7 digits and every number in between. Pretending our arbitrary limit is 7 digits).
Maybe he is actually harming himself by choosing such a low number to create a private key from. Easier to let the computers find if they start nearby.

Hi here is part 2 of my reply:
It makes sense to delete the wallet.dat file from your computer once you make the backups. Then whenever you need to use it, you can just plug in the USB stick and make sure the program knows where to look. 
This would mean you can feel safe when using your computer. Just know that whenever you do plug in the USB, if your computer is compromised, you are running the risk that the wallet.dat will get swiped. 
This leads to the next part of your post, which is about cold storage.
You can do cold storage without paper wallets. All cold storage means is that you have bitcoins that never touch the internet. You can do this with armory, electrum, paper wallets, etc. You could also do this with multibit (I think?).
What it works like is this:
You start a computer that is a freshly installed OS, or through a live USB. Not connected to the internet. You install a wallet program and let it create a wallet for you. You copy the public key and send bitcoins there, and then encrypt/back up the wallet. 
You either then never let that computer touch the internet, or if you are using a live usb, just shut it down which removes all data.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:49:12
It's not an actual hack, but a keylogger. Apparently lots of data has been taken from many computers. I am suggesting that some of the data taken includes bitcoin-qt wallets and passwords, which is why we are/may be seeing an influx of 'my coins are stolen' posts now.

Hidden Inflation, Stagnant wages
I'm not saying the dollar is going to collapse, or that gold will recover, or that bitcoin will takeoff due to a weak economy in the US.
Anyways, I invested moreso based on the technology than the economic implications.

Unfortunately the infrastructure isn't really there yet. Things aren't super simple yet. They will be in time, if bitcoin succeeds that is.

If you lose dollar bills the same is true. Cold stored coins may get insured backing at some future point.


But yet they can log into banks which use the same encryption as bitcoin and send money over the internet! It's because the front end has been made simple. This will happen soon.


 price discovery in progress. Check back in a few years


Leaders and money don't have to connect. I don't need a leader when I put money in a vending machine for a coke. What are you getting at with this point? I feel like there is some deeper ethical thing here but I don't see it.

@_date: 2013-12-05 12:45:04
Hey i'm intrigued by your ideas. What is your generation method? I assume it's quite similar (go offline, use bitaddress to make a wallet) but then instead of printing, you use something to encrypt a simple text file with the public and private key?
Then where do you upload it to? Its safe to place on things such as gmail or dropbox? Safe enough to (hypothetically) upload to the frontpage of reddit without worry?
And why not do the same exact thing but with the electrum seed (so you can sign transactions easily)
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:46:01
You have to fund your bitcoin wallet through coinbase.com, localbitcoins.com, or through an exchange like mtgox, bitstamp or btc-e
or someone could send you some. but thats the least likely scenario
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:13:21

Good advice. If the market is crashing it's already too late to pull out? I mean i'm pretty sure i've seen some charts where it goes to 0 though. But that is in extreme cases.
Anways i've already done a lot of learning just by being involved with bitcoin.
I bought once during a big bubble and also I bought during the lowest low of the crash since I believe in BTC. One of those trades I made with a smile, and the other I made with concern - guess which was the better one. I will probably reverse the emotions next time I am in the same situations.
Funnily enough I feel like the stock market now is in the same euphoric type of bubble, but thats just me extrapolating from my limited experience.

In very simple terms mining is trying to solve a puzzle.
Many people are all trying to solve the puzzle first. Whoever solves it first wins the prize, and then the puzzle resets.
If you are mining in a pool, then if your pool solves the puzzle, everyone gets a share of the prize. 
If you mine solo, then you have to solve the puzzle on your own. If you do, you get the whole prize. But you are in a race against many other competitors. 
Solving the puzzle is very hard. There is the tiniest chance in the universe that you can solve a block on your own. Like playing the lotto I guess. But the payoff is 25 btc.

Ah that actually did clear it up! I managed to find the treasure.
But the carriage return at the end isn't what was getting me (i'm aware of those from my small stints at programming). What happened was that when you copy and paste from reddit, the carriage returns between paragraphs are lost. Had to add them back in.
Great fun.
Also, the electrum seed as the clue was a cool little twist. (where was the clue for that in the OP though?)
