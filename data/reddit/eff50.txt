I do not understand the part where Alice can route her payments through my channel. So would that mean in the final signed balance sheet, Alice's purchase of coffee is reflected on it? Even though it was nothing to do with my 'Tab' with the coffee shop?

You can look now!

W124 wagon! He has HEDL on to that!

10K is going to be tested again. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:16:57
10K is the new 11K
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:45:37
It has been doing that same crap for months now. I do not know what makes anyone think that it will do anything different!
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:46:19
Why would it rise?

And so? 21 million BTC will rival Gold's valuation because the money stock will not increase fast/limited? Which would make it a rather poor currency, in the first place.

Speed of fiat transaction is low? What are you sending them by pigeons?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:52:18
So, we have reached the bottom for today.

Why not keep the Daily Discussion pinned?

Feel sorry for the ETC fellows. They have lost their shirt and some!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:47
Best advice.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:08:54
But what's the use? Alt coins all follow BTC and usually fare worse when BTC nosedives. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:21:36
Is today's drop due to China's move to block Bitcoin exchange websites?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:33:56
Its in the 8Ks!!!! Unbelievable! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:09:42
 I think Bitcoin valuation will fall to the amount of money it takes to mine one today, which is around $6000. Above that is will due to a mix of its own growth as a currency, scarcity and speculation.

Holding is not the only investment strategy which would have earned you profits in this. One could have bought/sold on everyone of those crashes and made money too, as long as one can correctly guess when to enter and when to exit.

YUGE buy-wall at 9000.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:32:24
" ~~Mr Gorbachev~~ FUD, Tear down this wall!"
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:52:38
No, the lowest we have gone till now was 7400. It shot up after that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:50:44
So...what are you trying to say? I am sure every millionaire wants a Lambo, they can't own one. Because there is just maybe 20000 Lamborghini's on road in total.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:43
Kia's are not bad! Especially if you can get a Stinger. ;)
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:53:50
Hey but look at the price a year back, we are still u---oh shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:57
The battle at 8500 has begun.
EDIT: Didn't even last a minute. It's taking in water fast folks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:00
All ammo used up.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:10:39
But what will you buy? If the government enacts laws which says that  it does not recognize cryptocurrency as a legal way of buying goods, nobody is going to sell you anything. Because, what is its value then? Or how is the seller supposed to understand its value in BTC? Or how is it going to report sales, accounting, taxation, if all of this is illegal? And why would it forfeit sales in FIAT for BTC? How is it going to earn profits?
You can sure hand around as much BTC you want, but even would not understand its value, if it is no longer pegged to the USD. How much will you give to a server? Or a guy whose car you want to buy?

Congrats. Up 20 percent already!

8700 has got beaten thrice now. The brave lads at the 8500 wall are gearing up to hold this charging monster.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:14:37
Decentralization, and no-regulation = No prison!
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:42:33
Exactly. Yesterday that wall was at 8400, and it had sent everything back up for it to float down over the last 12 hrs to break through 8400 again.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:40:23
Soon everybody will be wishing it was 3k still.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:13:24
This was always the case for last year. Pump and dump. 3500-4200 and then drop. Rinse and repeat.
