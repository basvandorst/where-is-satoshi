Wow, a very informative post. Thank you

1. I don't think that you can compare few percent discount to ability to chargeback. And i am not sure if I'd but anything from not well known places had I not have that ability. 
2. Aren't you? If one gets access to your private key, then he can just poof your bitcoin to his address, and you cannot do anything, right? With Id thefts it's usually not that easy.
3. Good one.
4. I dont get that one. So bitcoin is no way better than usd?

Just cool link about qr codes:

Ok, so bitcoin is much more convienient for sellers, but what is in bitcoin for customer?
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:34:45
But as far as i understand coinbase is no true bitcoin. The way you use them, they are just fast international money transfer, right? You are not using blockchain and bitcoin infrastructure?

1. Good one
2. Humble bundle with $1 stuff works somehow, are we talking about even lower payments? That's not a argument to use bitcoin now on normal shoping, right?
3. But on the other hand they need to worry about having their wallet stolen and lost. From a this year survey 17% of users of had their funds lost. And that is much worse then having your data stolen. If so, your funds are refunded and you need to receive a new card ($15 for new card loss vs whole wallet). I am not convinced here 
4. Good one
5. Good one
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:30:31
Ok, that's good point. Bitcoin could be cheaper than other forms of payments, because the cost difference could be offered as discount to customer. That makes sense.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:50:48
But that qr code is I bet no more convienent than proximity cards ;p Just joking, if that is that convienet in real life than it truly works great.
Sending money between friends - amazing, I wouldn't have thought of that. Thanks.

You know that loan includes inflation in it? So if your loan costs 6%, and inflation is 2%, then you are paying 4% above inflation. If bitcoin would deflate by 10% a year, and you still have to pay 4% premium to lender, then you would probably pay negative interest!

I don't quite get what you're saying.
Texts offer different tempo of conversation, and they are faster. They fit in different niche for me. 
Emails are cheaper, because a lot of people have tech needed already. They can also include photos, and are faster. So they fit different situations too.
So from my understanding, you're saying that sometimes one is better, other times another. When is bitcoin better for customer than credit card?

I totally not see appeal for "honest money" idea. For me it's solving problem that does not exist, and it create so much more uncertainty and problems. I'm more of a person who stands firmly on ground.
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:31:52
oook, that looks good. Thanks
I'll sure will read about these things. Thanks

What implications does it have? Governments in europe guarantee up to $100k, they offer a double step security, they help if there is fraud etc. I might be blind, but I've never had a problem with banks.
Is it just general anti-bank attitude in america?
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:30:12
oook, that looks good. Thanks
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:19:11
Oh, that's good one. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:28:18
Ah, but when for example I buy something on amazon, then after 3 seconds i got to know if payment have been accepted and I receive my good. That is much shorter time than when using bitcoin right?
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:40:29


That's not true. There is huge drama about corrupt subreddit mod, holocaust denier and admins do nothing. Even tough creator of xkcd.com asked them to help.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:54:49
But prepaid ones are usually easy to get, don't they? And bitcoin is more like prepaid then credit one, right?

push - you push cash out of your acccount. like you hold your wallet and gie cash, or wire transfer
pull - you give details to shooper, and he pulls cash out of your acc. like CC
on one customer make it happen, on latter the other side

Yeah, i finished it, but it took so long, and the results were not very interesting :|, so I ditch the idea of making anything with it
The most fun graph I got was questions about economic knowledge. [Imgur](
Blue and red are two groups of users, green is US population. Bitcoin community has higher knowledge about effects of inflation and about risk on stockmarket than average american person.
Also usage of bitcoin was interesting [Imgur](

I am scared of having bitcoin app on any smartphone. At least once a month you can hear about holes, exploits etc. that could steal your bank password or private data. I don't see widespread adoption of bitcoin in the world of normal, non tech savvy people. People who get viruses and all the shitty adware.
I see myself using internet transactions, because noone can steal money from my bank account with 2 clicks, and if someone tries to steal from my credit card, then it's problem of credit card company, not mine. Here someone steals your bitcoin and bam, they are gone. Untraceable, anonymous, on the other half of the globe.
That's not a question, but is there answer to that?
