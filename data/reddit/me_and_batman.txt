I still don't know what that means.

This is a bot. But I guess that's all it takes to be top comment here.

Again, where are you getting this from? What laws would such a machine violate? Just because something *could* be used for illegal activity doesn't mean it's illegal.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:21:50
Why do you say this? None of these things the machine is requiring are a result of government regulation.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:51:59
Again, you are comparing a world-wide crisis to...what? Do you honestly think if bitcoin were around and widely used during the crash that it wouldn't have been affected? It would have been right down the toilet like everything else.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:54:55
OK, how are bitcoins insured?
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:44:18
What is the standard value of diamonds, gold, and silver?
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:24:14
I haven't assumed anything. I am not the one who keeps bringing up worldwide catastrophes. What makes you think that bitcoin wouldn't also lose value in a worldwide catastrophe?

Having links doesn't mean it's a source. Did you click the links? They explain what I'm saying. They don't address bitcoin at all.

Banks: FDIC
Bitcoin: ?

What assets are you talking about? MtGox is a trading platform, not a physical entity with assets.


You are trying to compare the best case scenario of one with the worst case of multiple scenarios of another. 
"Why get a job when I could get laid off? I'll just play the lottery because I could win millions." This is what you sound like.
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:25:27
With FDIC... how are bitcoins insured?
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:46:01
Yes, they would. That's how insurance works. You plan for the absolute worst possible scenario. Not because it's likely, but because it is possible. Having a plan for something doesn't automatically make it more likely.
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:35:22
So bitcoins are insured by FDIC?
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:48:54
I don't know what that means.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:23:03
OK? You haven't told me anything. The reserve keeps a ratio of estimated insurance needs on hand. That's how all insurances work. All this means is in the event of a payout being greater than what's on hand, it gets paid out over time.
How are people getting money back from MtGox?
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:17:47
Fair enough.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:52:49
Can someone elaborate on why the bitcoin will stay valuable? The video shows the decline in purchase power of the dollar but what proof is there that bitcoins will stay valuable?

Where do you get gold losing 30% each year?
