Agreed, bitcoins intrinsic value is the trust-less solution, the network-effect, the network itself, etcetera and all that contributes to it's extrinsic exchangeable-value. Bitcoin is just the very first time something like this has existed. Even if you did the comparable thing to melting coins for their metallic-value instead of their monetary one by making it a colored coin or contract token or whatever), you can switch between extrinsic and intrinsic whenever you want, no damage done or value lost.

Yeah the "tegenlicht" version is a reaction on the documentary by 3 different Dutch-speaking experts, from different perspectives, but predominantly applied to the current situation in The Netherlands. Not any less interesting in my opinion. The original does not have an online viewable version, it's still running in the cinemas.
I've 1-upped the request for a bitcoin-payable ondemand version in the comments. In the meantime I've caught a pretty nasty case of the flu, so I won't be able to post a translated version of the Dutch-reaction just yet.

It's opensource, Satoshi really is irrelevant and his/her/their dayjob even moreso. 


I did not say you weren't allowed, I wondered why you'd want to be here. You do realize you kind of described yourself as a troll there.


Who cares about what Wall Street wants? Then again I'm not one of the speculators want to get rich quick guys, so I might be biased.


Again, small steps, one at a time. Why are you so impatient? Bitcoin is moving pretty rapidly compared to it's size. Modems didn't disappear overnight either.


Now you're just dreaming, a currency like what you describe has never existed and probably never will.  A life that's safe, simple and non-volatile is not a life worth living and our currency should reflect that.

Thanks to the show and mostly Andreas comforting words, I've calmed down quite a bit. I was in a feverish rage ever since I heard the psychopathic remark about gladly stomping out 1000 blooming flowers in order to prevent even a single possible launderer to possibly emerge. I was extremely frustrated nobody in the room called that hypocrite out on that remark and just went on like nothing happened.
But enough about them, Andreas keep up the good work and I hope you can keep the fire going.
I've been searching, waiting and hoping for something like bitcoin for more than 20 years. When opensource and Linux came along I had hoped the same ideas would transfer into society and accelerate, but I was really starting to slip into depression because of the slow pace of adoption I was perceiving around me. Bitcoin and hearing people like you Andreas has given me back hope and renewed energy.
I've bought in at the recent ath and I don't care about the price dropping, other than wondering why people even bothered buying into bitcoin when their conviction in the concept is that weak. Actually I'm very frustrated that I'm only able to put in fiat and word of mouth, I wish I was able to do more. I'm so glad there are people like Andreas and the rest of the bitcoin community who are picking up the slack and then some.

No man, you don't get it. 
All the dollars and euros were stolen because of Transaction-malleability, I mean DDOS, it's a hacker I tell you, it has absolutely nothing to do with mtGox or MK. It's all so clear, obviously. Why do you want proof of theft when all you need to do is trust MK on his word alone. You make it sound like he would be interested in hiding a million bitcoins and millions of dollars worth of alternate currencies. Where's your proof?

All your points just seem to lament that bitcoin is not ready yet, but I did not see any point that are unsolvable in bitcoin, just not widely applied as of yet.
1. Retail doesn't need to wait for block-confirmation, just that you have the funds and there are no double spends, which takes seconds not minutes.
1. Escrow, clever bitcoin scripting, paper wallets in fire-proofed bank vaults
1. Fell in the gox trap as well, needed a temporary place for my bitcoins so I could setup my own wallets, but was never able to get them out again with verification problems taking many months and now they're gone. But I do agree that it has very little to do with Bitcoin, just like stolen gold does not change or affect gold.
1. Paypal like refunds can be enforced in bitcoin as well, but as an option. Given Paypal's track record I kind of understand why little to no vendors have taken a liking to implementing it.

Tnx MrGoogz, good idea to put my bitcointalk-post up here, which makes it a lot easier to find and discus.
I'm now wondering how we as a community can demand or even force some transparency and validity on to the market. Bitcoin has now grown way past the point that these kinds of jokes should be tolerated any longer. If China doesn't ban that shit, we as a community sure as hell should.

I've heard a lot of people saying that China owns the majority of BTC and btc-trades, but what evidence is there to support that?  Not only do Chinese exchanges operate with zero-fees, but they have been caught padding their numbers with zeros as well.  
Wouldn't those two facts alone cast some serious doubt about the Chinese numbers and also explain the massive price swings from China?

Odd, all the last charts I've seen say that more than 80% of bitcoin trades are in USD and around 10% is in Yuan (so all of China is less than mtGox after losing it's market share). Also the previous spike to 1000$ was caused by the US officially recognizing bitcoin and not calling it illegal. Trusting the data published by the Chinese exchanges is rather silly, since they not only operate with zero fees, but also pad their numbers with zeros.
Doesn't mean we aren't going down though. I've noticed that the exchange rate of Bitcoin has absolutely no relation to anything rational.

I agree that people wanting to profit from bitcoin, but without interest in it's potential are in it for the wrong reasons. However people who complain that bitcoin is not the world reserve currency **right now** as their main complaint are exponentially more silly. Yeah bitcoin really needs to become the world reserve currency and it needs to do it **right effing now** before it could possibly be worth anyones time and attention.
As you may have noticed from the above, I have the polar opposite view as you do. I see no way in hell how corporations or institutions could come up with or sustain something like bitcoin. The current financial system is not nearly as perfect as the majority seems to want to believe (more like shitting bricks in fear of even looking at it objectively) and I cannot conceive of a way to fix it, so humanity needs a completely new system going forward or enjoy the spectacle of catastrophic collapse. In both cases we get to see something interesting in our lifetimes.
Similarly if you weren't betting everything on a single decrepit old horse, would you still be so fearful of bitcoin being a viable option?
I'm not in it for personnal gain and have and will reinvest/donate all "gains" right back into ideas which I hope will change the world for the better.
To me bitcoin is another tiny step in the direction the world should have been going if not for the cold-war holding us back for another century and destroying all progress we needed two biggish wars to get started. Lets hope we don't need another few global wars to finally improve ourselves. I'm not that confident that all parties involved understand that loosing a war is a viable outcome, while destroying the planet possibly is not.
I have another question to the OP, how do you feel about stagnation and the chances that things will magically improve? Are you only interested in short term personal gain, before you'd consider contributing anything? The current system is not fit for its task and cannot be fixed, so we need something new.
I find myself getting more and more irritated with the complacent consumerist attitude in general and towards things like bitcoin in particular. If the majority of the people in the West have really devolved into parasites and getting disgusted by the notion of having to lift a finger or risk anything, then I really hope that we're in for a global change.

1. In case of bankruptcy would a collective claim increase or decrease chances of getting reimbursement of btc-holdings?
2. Since Karpeles so far has been telling obvious lie after obvious lie, why is he not being charged as the thief  himself? This whole bankruptcy case, might very well be a ruse by him to hide the fact that he is trying to run off with the bitcoins. To me and probably most of the victims, he is the prime suspect, since he has categorically refused to provide any proof of his claims and he should be prevented from destroying any evidence.
Apart from Karpeles' word is there even any evidence that mtGox is bankrupt instead of a thieving den of liars?
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:57:33
Another idea might be to explain the concept in non-technical terms.
Someone figured out a practically applicable math model for a contract system that:
* solves the problem of requiring a trusted (and guaranteed fallible) third party.
* is voluntary instead of compulsory. (Carrot model instead of the stick, it's based on participating based on incentives, merit and possibly reward)
* has no secrets, because the inner workings of the machine are open (source), as well as all transactions are public record and easily accessible.
* is global and unrestricted (allowing access for even the current majority of unbanked people on the planet).
* resilient and secure because copies of the entire history and current transactions are kept, checked and signed by each individual participant. (Maybe add that to corrupt the system you'd have to convince most participants around the world to become your accomplice)(Another anecdote could be that even if a large part of civilization would be temporarily cut off from power and internet, the whole system could recover with no loss from the few remaining working area's).
* Optionally pseudonymous not anonymous, just like the internet.
* Follows an issuance model based on the mining of precious metals, decreasing over time and limited in supply.
Maybe also point out some of the risks and challenges that are still left:
* It's very, very early days. People are still laying foundations, bitcoin is not at all a finished product.
* Lacks sufficient anonymity to be used widely in it's current form, without exposing your entire bank account to the world. Which could invite shady elements to perform personal (5$ wrench) attacks. (Money laundering concerns are vastly inferior to this threat imo)
* It's an experiment without precedent, so you can't realistically expect people to make accurate predictions of the future. There is no historic analogy to follow or to compare it to.
* Is not a solution for human failures and actions. So it will not eradicate crime, theft, corruption and bankruptcy, but instead moves these effects out of the payment/contract system itself and limits it to the edges. (The machines are not interested in your money, they just run like clockwork and have no plans of their own)
I'm a bit strapped for time, this is all I could come up with off the top of my head.
EDIT(s) Added some elaborations.

Magic the gathering online xchange was victim of presumable magic disappearance event. Karpeles says so, so it **must** be true.

The way I understood it, this was part of the security model of bitcoin. You don't own anything, but with the completely free key-pair you are able to work in the system. Working with the Bitcoin-system means trying to convince people to point some of the bitcoins from areas they can influence to the ones your key can influence. It just so happens that convincing people is easier with money. Fact remains that sending bitcoins is more like sending world-wide readable text-messages than "owning property".
I appreciate the difficulties with legality, maybe it could be compared to stealing someones ticket with respect to exchanges like mtGox stealing your promised coins. But the bitcoin system itself was designed to work by taking care of your own security and keeping those hard to find keys private. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:11:38
Hey I agree, bitcoin is nowhere near what I've been hoping to see happen for almost 30 years now (damn time sure flies). Nobody expects you to be crazy about anything, participation in this experiment is completely voluntary and purely emergent, there will be no leader. If there were a leader/company/government that would mean the experiment has failed and bitcoin would be dead. I find it odd that people think a single entity would be able to produce something like bitcoin and convince the world to use it voluntarily. That will never happen, because it would not be neutral and it would become something political/religious and you'd never get mass adoption.
If you do not want to be involved with this social experiment, then I don't understand why you'd even come here? Were you expecting some consumer product, with a prospectus and some helpdesk to bitch to?
If you're waiting for legality I'm suspecting you don't really appreciate what bitcoin is and what it's implications are. Either that, or you're trying to set a new record in showing patience. Have you heard the terms trust-less and peer to peer when people are referring to bitcoin? The whole point of bitcoin is to remove dependency on 3rd-parties. The very same parties you're awaiting approval of, but I'm not expecting them to enjoy or cooperate in being made obsolete by machines anytime soon. The basic premise is the dismantling of inefficient pyramids and replacement of most of these bureaucratic-tumors.
As I said, I suspect you don't want anything to do with bitcoin unless it's the world reserve currency and probably don't want to bother with it before hand. That's fine, for now bitcoin is still completely voluntary.  But demanding some sort of finished product as if you have some right to it and criticizing peoples efforts and interest, strikes me as a bit odd.
Sofar I've only lost big time on bitcoin and spent more than half of them on projects I thought were interesting. Well apart from the ones stolen by Karpeles, I was not intending to invest in him.

So Karpeles is investigating Karpeles and concludes it's not Karpeles' fault. Wow who would've thunk? And there was no-one in the court who found it odd that a bitcoin-bug allowed everything non-bitcoin-related of Karpeles to be hacked up to his personal archives like databases and personal online accounts, that have nothing to do with bitcoin-protocol at all.
Why are there no real experts looking at this and is Karpeles allowed so much time and leeway to fabricate lie after lie till one sticks with the non technical judges?
Why is he allowed to keep secrets? Real experts should look into this and other than giving all information they need, Karpeles should be out of the picture entirely.
First question should be, show us your cold storage btc-addresses and proof that you have been robbed. Next show us how mtGox "cold" storage works and why they can be reached through a firewall as was stated by Karpeles himself.
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:59:57
So how does this work, do we have to register somewhere?
Also has there been any real info about what actually happened? 
I'm getting real tired of the none of the above explanations of Karpeles, not a single one of the official statements are proven or plausible. As I see it, it's not about Karpeles, but about the bitcoins that aren't his, he should not be allowed to keep his mouth shut, but just fess up and put everything out in the open complete with blockchain verifiable proof. Until then Karpeles is the one who stole the bitcoins.

Thanks, I especially liked the video presentation, that was a very refreshing take on things. I did have some trouble catching all his words without pausing and rewinding.
I'm a bit surprised at the large number of similar minded people and viewpoints I'm encountering in Bitcoin. It's a bit shocking to be able to actually communicate ideas. Has Hell frozen over? I'm used to encountering panic reactions from people clinging to their make belief sacred cows.
For as long as I can remember I've always been flabbergasted about the fact that so many people cling to "systems" that are not only the cause of much (outspoken) irritation and grief, but that are also completely virtual and exist solely as figments of their imagination. 
When I am able to get someone to understand, that by just changing your perception everything could change. That even all these "systems" or assumptions about "but that's how **it** works" could disappear in the blink of an eye, with something as simple as enough people simply changing their minds. At best I receive shocked expressions.  Almost as if I had just tried to kill them or something.  Most of the time people even get aggressive as if I've just pulled an alcoholic away from his drink.  It took me a while to learn the hard way that changing peoples minds is actually not as easy as I imagined and even longer before I realized that it had nothing to do with me failing to communicate correctly.
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:06:25
If time allows it, you should probably point out all the benefits for improving administration and cutting costs for government as well.
Because bitcoin also finally offers solutions for:
* secure storage of information, because bitcoin is inflammable and far less susceptible to individual corruption and failure.
* Global as well as local identification, with far less risk of identity theft, because you can stamp with your signet ring, without giving someone the ability to reverse engineer your signetring.
* On the same network, one can easily manage access restricions, subscriptions, museum cards, public transportation tickets, food stamps you name it.
* it can achieve fair, publicly verifiable voting while at the same time guaranteeing the essential privacy of voters through bitcoins pseudonimity.
* Enormous cost and efficiency improvements, because it for the first time offers a system to very easily track and automatically account for all moneyflows inside ones own organizations. Offering almost inconceivable improvements in transparency, accessible insight, automatic accounting and making detection of malpractice and corruption far more easy.
* it can offer instantaneous access and verification of undeniable documents and contracts, by simply stamping digital fingerprints of documents with your signet ring. Imagine how many issues with legality will vanish with just this simple feature.
**NB** 
All of the above does not require the persons involved to even have a home address or postbox. All of this will work equally well for a homeless person, without a place to store his personal documents, because the network can store those and he can have access with his own bitcoin-signet ring/fingerprint (whatever analogy you prefer).
The list of possibilities can go on and on, bitcoin is the **first** working, robust digital solution for signing unique information while still allowing it to be copied or reproduced, without the risk of compromising said uniqueness and most importantly without needing a trusted person or persons to audit everything and secure its storage. 
If you stop to think about it, requiring humans to audit and verify something as immense as human interaction is ridiculous if not completely insane as well as impossible, the technology of bitcoin is the only viable solution. The question should not be why bitcoin, but more why isn't the government putting all its efforts in this new technology and solving a majority of its current management problems and improving everyones lives.
One of the most brilliant aspects of bitcoin for me is that it relies on human greed to keep the system up and running. Bitcoin doesn't need men with guns, bitcoin only needs the presence of human greed. Could you name one thing that is more guaranteed than human greed?
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:13:21
It might also be wise to mention the possible improvements that could be made reliably and cheaply with the use of bitcoin. Surely even the central bank of Mexico would appreciate a very cheap, reliable, global and unforgeable administrative system that does not require submission to any foreign or unfriendly entity. 
I don't think it's a daily occurence that someone drops into your lap an administrative system that can solve all your digital wishes so cheaply, especially considering the non currency digital applications: secure identity system with added options like, public transport tickets, membership, digital signatures, unfalsifiable records and recordtracking, you name it. And you don't even have to spend millions upon millions to create the system plus infrastructure on a single one of those systems, disregarding the fact that before bitcoin no one has actually succeeded in building something even remotely as reliable or useful.
EDIT just remembered there was [a similar thread]( a while back for a French thinktank. I've posted a link to my suggestions, but it's probably wise to read the rest of the thread as well.

Then I really don't understand what point you are trying to make. My point was that you can't produce something like bitcoin as a traditional company or country for that matter and expect the whole world to accept it. Opensourcing the idea and giving it out free of any restrictions is the only way and at the same time makes the progenitor irrelevant in every way, shape or form.


Why would I? I only want gradual wider adoption and further developments of the idea. I'm actually not at all happy with the inflow of WallStreet and a complete army of opportunists, with no interest in the concept or possibilities whatsoever. I was hoping bitcoin would bring opportunities to everyone but WallStreet and similar ilk.


Again here you come with corporate marketing aesthetics. Sorry to burst your bubble, but the numbers on traditional corporate software are only there to make you buy it and have little to no relation to actual features or state of the software itself. Opensource version-numbers follow a completely different logic and don't follow the same Wow-over-6000-numerology. So to put your mind at ease, opensource software with numbers below 1.0 can not only be RC but even be better than GiveMeYourDough6000XP^tm march edition in seasonal colored box.
Btw the price of bitcoin compared to its utility is still well below the astronomical price-estimates for rather silly webapps (and I'm talking total market cap here, not price per btc).
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:58:01
Keep in mind that there is no official news about stolen BTC, so for now there are no 750k BTC lost (yet).
The only official news is that the source html on the mtgox site is going to place an announcement of acq, whatever that means.
So mtgox is down and nobody knows what's next. MtGox might even have all the btc safe and sound, but just not allowed to make statements while they're selling the company. It's all speculation.

We don't even have a 1.0 crypto-currency yet, so everyone talking about 2.0-variants is talking out of their ass. Beware of people selling you shit, because they hope you'll buy it.
As of now bitcoin and all alts are experiments and no one knows what the future will bring. Looking at the past, then it seems that first movers have a very big advantage and bitcoin has a sentimental/emotional stake that no other alt can come close to. So my guess is that a new alt will have to be pretty spiffy for it to have a chance of "replacing" bitcoin any time soon.
Regardless I'm very keen to see what people come up with and what kinds of new and unforeseen things will emerge from this.

The best I can offer at the moment is to try and screengrab the video-reaction on the Documentary in Dutch of the "tegenlicht" link I posted earlier, upload it to something like youtube and then add translated subtitles.
Keep in mind however that I've never done something like that before (screengrabbing and subtitling) and 50 minutes of speech-heavy content is not exactly a 5 minute job.
Any tips on how I could save some time on any of the above steps, somebody willing to review the subtitles would be great. I'd only be doing the Dutch/Flemish/German -&gt; English ones. I might be able to make a start with the Dutch/Flemish -&gt; German ones, but I'm not to comfortable with my mastery of German grammar after not speaking or writing it for over a decade (Understanding a language and speaking it are very different things).

What I gathered from the quotes, was something along the lines of bitcoin is here now, works, has a proven track-record, has momentum and large acceptance, while Ethereum has none of those. Also, as mentioned in the article and in the discussion above, there are other ways to leverage the benefits that the Bitcoin network offers for the things Mastercoin and Counterparty want, while at the same time keeping the bitcoin-blockchain clean and focused.
On the other hand, I am a bit surprised why people are talking about Ethereum as if it actually works, while it is not at all certain that it has a chance of succeeding. Do people realize that Ethereum is at the moment nothing more than a pie in the sky and that there might actually be better solutions out there right now for the "problems" it proposes to fix? None of the current ones have anything close to the same marketing support though, which might help create the idea of there being no other options.
Admittedly there are a couple of things I find a bit suspect about Ethereum, such as the comparatively large and costly marketing, the mention of privileged investors, some consistent strange remarks in public interviews (like wanting to pull all developers of crypto-currencies into their sphere of influence and ambitions of being the next Iphone appstore) and rumors about hardware licenses.

Granted I'm a bit late to really dive into bitcoin, eventhough I was already a believer more than a year ago. Back then I had to make a choice where I would focus my undivided attention and made the wrong call, probably underestimating the growth of Bitcoin based on my experience with opensource and GnuLinux adoption. I'm probably one of the minority not actually all that interested in the monetary value of Bitcoin, but more in it being another step towards changing human society in ways I've been unsuccessfully working towards for apparently more than 20 years now.
I've been interested in removing corruption from organizations since my early teens and could never figure out why I was unable to motivate or convince people until I discovered the reason in Bitcoin. It might sound stupid, but since I was never interested in accumulating personal wealth or gold, I did not recognize it's appeal to others. (Probably explains why I'm unfamiliar with the more outspoken goldbugs, which judging from the remarks is what Peter Schiff seems to be)
Using peoples greed to sustain and proliferate a system enabling a new way of living is one of the most brilliant aspects of Bitcoin for me.

There is no single investment point for bitcoin the protocol. You could invest in the projects trying to add new things to bitcoin. But the things you like done to/with bitcoin are personal so you'll have to search to find them yourself, scour the internet, listen to announcements, attend conferences etc., or start a company yourself.
Some of the bitcoin-focused initiatives I'm rooting for are Neo-Bee, Mastercoin and colored coins. What I'm searching for are projects where low-cost and low-power easy access bitcoin hardware is developed and deployed in the areas on the planet that most need it (to prevent confusion, I'm not talking about the spoiled parts of the EU or US). Prefereably without the need for internet or with their own networking options.
My personal investment strategy is if I can spend 9 out of 10 of my bitcoins to make bitcoin 10 times better, then I've gained more than I've spent. (Well that's the plan, hadn't counted on mtGox taking a large chunk of my btc hostage and then dissappearing with them)

Basic idea is that traders take positions on the value of the altcoin (btx) compared to for example the US-dollar (short vs long). Both have to put enough collateral of bitshares in the bet so it can accommodate the price swings both ways. The bet itself is always worth the dollar-amount, no matter the price of bitshares. That bet is called bitUSD and now has become a cryptocurrency on it's own and you have essentially got a dollar that can do everything an altcoin can. This is off course not limited to USD, but you can make a bitAnything if there is enough of a market for it, hence the btX or bitsharesX moniker.
Oh and in regards to mining, it's a proof of stake system which converts transaction fees into dividends.

Beware rant incoming!
I care for their not so subtle messages even less. Some of the things they've said during their fundraising campaign were so off-putting that it has completely killed all the enthusiasm I had at the beginning (I was so enthusiastic that I was even willing to overlook the ripple-style "early investor" money-grub premine). They're mostly talking shit about bitcoin and the others, calling them diseases and such (because decentralization and experimentation is bad mkay), while in the meantime trying to take the credit for a lot of the ideas that have come out from that. For example their most touted concept Distributed Autonomous Companies, originally by Larimer and given shape in the form of Invictus.io, the same project Hoskinson used to work for. Also trying to setup another walled-garden app-store and centralized monopolistic vendor-lock-in. (But hey after we've taken all your money, your free to "fire the investors", so we're perfectly legit, honest, nothing like M$ or secondhand-fruit at all)
More and more I'm starting to wonder why some many people are buying the overhyped nonsense. Is it just because they like the sound of Turing-complete and 2.0? It sounds difficult, so it must be better. Meanwhile we have not even begun to test the possibilities of bitcoin and it's scripting options. If you're afraid of words like multi-sig you'd better run and hide from the Turing-complete scripting boogey man.
I have to admit though, their marketing campaign is very successful in pumping up the hype. Nice pictures, selling prospects of castles in the sky, making promises which they themselves have admitted not having the foggiest on how to realize (because bounty and magic), at the same time completely drowning out or ignoring the valid criticism and reservations.
EDITED because of errors in spelling and grammar.

First of all I can't imagine Bitcoin without alt-coins, but just for thought experiment sake.
The altcoins help with keeping regulation and prohibition at bay. Control freaks might prefer to monitor and foster the single large  Bitcoin-scene, over making the alt-market explode when they try to crack down on bitcoin. Without the alts I think Bitcoin might have been attacked close to destruction by the powers that be.
Also competition and evolution is what Bitcoin is all about imo. If there really is a significantly better alternative, it should replace Bitcoin and continue to improve everyones lives. 
To prevent another attempt at hyping: No Ethereum is not better, Bitcoin can run on any Turing-complete language and does not need to run on top of a single very limited one, same goes for all the alt-coins and that is most definitely not the sign of a disease, it's called free market and evolution as opposed to trying to create another parasitic monopoly.

Relevant? How? I got a similar impression as olook when I read the article. Even the projects who are supposed to be the subject of the article are quoted to have dismissed Ethereum as irrelevant in the same article. So to me it also looked like the author went out of his way to get Ethereum in there any which way he could.
I also commented on it in the disqus area, but it seems that did not go down well with CoinDesks' representative. For a site that is quick to point out "errors" or "issues" with others, they can be remarkably sensitive when alerted to their own.

We also need one that says: If bitcoins are property, who owns them?
Nobody actually owns bitcoins or the Bitcoin-network. People might have found an astronomically hard to find access switch (private key), that can be used to influence a part of the network, but no individual actually owns anything.
What's next, I have to keep a record of all text-messages and their subjective monetary evaluation, because they are now considered "property"

In short, mtGox had no cold storage at all, no security and no auditing. They also conveniently fail to mention that they have been warned about all these topics for many, many months in advance if not years, repeatedly and publicly.
These statements prove that Karpeles is either insane or personally responsible for the theft. Is there a way to call them out on these ridiculous and false statements and call in proper experts, before Karpeles conveniently destroys all evidence against himself? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:33:10
Not if you insist on waiting for 6 confirmations, which is completely ridiculous for most day to day purchases. If someone could post the math on the cost to create a more than 6 block deep fork of the blockchain, I think people might start to appreciate just how unlikely the risk is.
For small purchases you could simply check if a double spend was attempted and if the funds are available, this can be done in seconds like apparently with the Mycelium android-wallet. The need to wait for confirmations is quickly becoming one of the bitcoin myths.
Also don't forget that people don't even need to use bitcoin directly, like with for example NeoBee's payment network. Instant payments and let the payment processor work out the rest.

From what we've seen and heard sofar, Karpeles considers it a bug in the bitcoin software that you can't store your private keys in a plain-text file on public internet accessible locations for safe keeping like a reddit-post for example.
Or according to Karpeles the whole universe is bugged and not his fault, he would have php-scripted his own perfect bug-free version of course.

Nah, the old pyramids will pout a bit, maybe organize a strike or something about being made obsolete or being out of work or something like that! But what choice do we have, we've got to be competitive here. Got to go with the times, time waits for no one. They're being fired and replaced with more efficient machines and that's that.
They should be glad we even want to work with them, we could just as easily go abroad.

Compared to what? The horrible living conditions of the past might not be as bad as many people tend to believe.
Even the most exploited peasants in Medieval England were not required to make even close the working hours that their well of offspring are required to make nowadays in order to just be able to feed and house themselves.
I don't know where you're from, but in my country it is now almost impossible to feed and raise a family from a single income. Quality of life and purchasing power is decreasing rapidly in my nick of the woods and I'm told that I'm in one of the best parts of the world.

The way I understood this proposal 3 was more like:
Use any type of separate blockchain you want with any separate currency you want, but backed / freely interchangeable with bitcoins(currency).
Also isn't Ethereum more like 2, but not on the bitcoin blockchain? This project seems to be a way to remove the limitations of the bitcoin blockchain, while still utilizing the value to the fullest (really would make bitcoin a lot more valuable) and it does put quite some competing pressure on number 2 projects and it really does look like a serious competitor for all alt-coins including Ethereum.
Another thing you've mentioned before, but I'm still confused about. How would running a serious sized alt-coin on top of Ethereum in any way be more efficient or less resource intensive? Isn't the core concept of Ethereum being an interpreted scripting language on top of a blockchain (trading ease of use for efficiency and speed) versus running a DAC/O/A on precompiled-software? I understand Ethereums application for simple or smaller scale use cases, but I don't see how it could possibly compete at scale with precompiled optimized ones, especially if the latter can be directly integrated with bitcoin.

Odd to talk to fellow Dutchies in English but here goes:
Try to get a handle on how technical or knowledgeable your average audience will be. If you think bitcoin is a culture-shock for them then I'd advise against thought experiments like Ethereum, I'd stick with actual working solutions like bitcoin and maybe near future solutions like mastercoin (although Bitshares might be closer to home for people more familiar with shares and such). (Ethereum does have some good marketing and hype going, but they've set themselves some major technical and potentially unsolveable showstopping hurdles. Those need to be solved first, before they could be considered viable imo and I would not be comfortable with pointing newcomers or investors to Ethereum as it stands now).
Are you brainstorming on format on how to present the subject or looking for ways to describe bitcoin in non-geek terminology? For the latter I tried to come up with a list of [suggestions] ( in a similar reddit post albeit more focused on government. One very big plus of bitcoin over IDEAL is the potential to tap into the new market of the currently unbanked population of the world. That opportunity alone should be able to grab the attention of any businessman. 
If you're searching for a format, it might be wise to put out some feelers into what kinds of interests and questions your audience might have and organize a little presentation or discussion panel with a couple of well-spoken bitcoin-experts. Reserve a large amount of time for questions of the audience. Maybe a more informal setup where you have multiple experts each at a table where people can have some 1 on 1 contact, or organize a few small workshops that demonstrate what bitcoin can do live in realtime.
Maybe organize some sort of competition with the audience. Where you challenge the audience to come up with current problems or difficulties in the current legacy system and let them ask the experts to come up with solutions for those using the bitcoin technology. If that's to chaotic make a list of current business-models/practices and let the audience pick one and let the experts present a way to improve or replace that model. (Make sure to give the experts the options first or let them come up with a few of them, so they can come prepared, while the audience still feels like they are participating)

No bigger blocks are in fact dangerous not even considering that btc-blocks do not scale linearly.
I lost the link, but I did read somebody doing the math on bigger blocks with the result that it will help a 30% cluster of miners that have their blocks delayed to the rest of the internet through the great firewall of china, to inevitably gain a monopoly over time. Another study came ot the conclusion that segwit2x 8Mb blocks will result in 90% reduction of nodes. Whereas I have seen no studies confirming Roger Vers big-block claims that it is risk free, weird since he is such a renowned and lauded mathematician, computer science and economic polymath. 
Also even with centralized datacenters it will still not scale, so they will still do centralized offchain layers, but on top of a centralized main-net.
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:55:22
Not only was there a study that showed that increasing the blocksize to the segwit2x 8Mb ones would result in 90% of the nodes disappearing. Even a smaller increase in blocksizes combined with 30% of the hashpower with a better interconnection (great firewall of china), especially combined with asicboost shenanigans would result in them taking over completely. So we would then have the peope republic of china coin and they love individual freedom and sovereignty. I don't understand why people so easily dismiss these pretty blatant risks. 
Also what most big blockers conveniently leave out is that blocks do NOT scale linearly, so bigger blocks will also NOT scale bitcoin, despite the convenient rhetoric. Scaling of bitcoin was always going to have to be done off chain, that's what everybody signed up for apparently without wanting to realize that.
Maybe it's because most westerners can't even imagine the reality of living in communist China that they fail to see the danger. Hell Jihan Wu might have been compromised already and he's trying to warn us by doing the most moronic hostile takeover attempt ever (pretty implausible but one can dream).
For me if bitcoin falls for this ridiculous takeover attempt than it's as good as dead. As it will then turn into another eth-bailout-edition/Dash where an easily 5$-dollar-wrencheable group owns a vast majority of control over the network. And as usual we will be fucked for decades to come if not longer, because the masses just love their cults and monopolies.
Decentralization will never ever be able to outscale purposefully designed centralized options. 
Btw, talking about how monopolies of power will attack us to retain their control, this whole thing fits their MO pretty damn nicely (you know like embrace - extend -extinguish and similar). Using rhetoric tricks to fool the uneducated like this bs fallacy of scaling is bad therefore the devs are bad and we need leadership and more centralization and a central controlled vetted, censored (closed source) and completely new development team, a concerted defamation campaign against the current developers, while having more easily controllable alternatives lined up, like eth , dash, ripple etc. To me it appears that the cryptocurrency scene is under attack already, and kinda scary how easy and effective they are at doing it.

Should the bitcoin-core repo ever turn into the same horrorshow that team Bitmain is putting up than bitcoin would need a new repo yeah. But I do find it strange how much support is being thrown towards a bug in the system like bitmain, weird and sad if something like bitcoin could be destroyed so easily and also scary how easy it is to manipulate the greedy masses.
