But facebook and myspace are platforms, not open protocols, so that's not a good example. Protocols that are good enough to get the job done and gain enough usage are not easily replaced. People build things on top of protocols, people merely interact with platforms, this is the big distinction.
This is why we all use HTTP/HTML/Javascript, because they were all good enough to get the job done, and there is so much tech built on them now that they're near impossible to replace. It's easier to write a compiler that converts code to Javascript, than to replace Javascript. I could come up with a more efficient way to transmit data than HTTP, yet it would never succeed.

Nice. Sometimes I think about trying to setup a mining operation where my parents live in eastern Washington. There electricity is some of the cheapest in the country at .027. I think the biggest mining operation in the US is out there.

The key point is that anyone can build on it. Old centralized systems only innovate from the center, but an open system like Bitcoin allows innovation from anyone. You might gain some insight by learning about how Linux went from a dorm room project to running most of the internet and mobile devices. The power of open technology is quite astonishing.


Ever try taking $1M cash on an international flight? No, because you'd end up detained.


When you use banks, credit cards, paypal, etc. the company routing the transaction is free to deny it if they see fit, just like they have done for WikeLeaks and other organizations they consider immoral.






You're not thinking big enough. This is not just about consumer to merchant payments, this about building a new opt-in financial system free from government and bank corruption. A system where you can spend your money the way you like without having to ask for any permission. Yes, a system like that is going to be slower and more costly, but it has a unique set of features which are very desirable to many people.

How much do you pay for electricity where you live?

I think the market dominance is kinda a misleading metric. A good chunk of the market is currently ETH tokens, which are more like businesses than currencies. Also, as the crypto economy grows, it's only natural that bitcoin will have a smaller slice of a much larger pie.

Too many people are pessimistic and have no ability to dream into a better future. They look at what's wrong with the current version of something, not all the amazing possibilities for making it right. Of course better UX will come for crypto, it's inevitable with an open protocol that allows innovation from all over the world. We'll know Bitcoin has finally made it when it's being used by the global financial system without people even knowing it, because the banks of the future will be built on it.

You can copy the code, but that's not really where the value is. The value is in the network, and you cannot simply copy that. The reason BTC is so valuable is that it's stood the test of time and proven that it's extremely secure.

I actually agree with you. I’ve been into bitcoin for many years and I see the long game in this and how pervasive the the tech will be in the future. It’s just Kodak is a failing company that has missed out on innovation since the birth of digital cameras, and this is clearly a cash grab to boost their stock price.

Very well said! Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:18:01
So they completely missed the digital camera revolution, and now they’re going to get into a revolution unrelated to their business. Sounds like a cash grab.

100k brother!

Seriously. I think when people complain about lightning, they are essentially saying, "I don't understand it, therefore it can never work."
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:09:04
Thanks for being a voice of reason. I think a big part of the problem is we have all these armchair engineers who don't understand why you need to scale in layers, and why increasing blocksize is just kicking the can down the road, and why we need to be extremely careful with something as import as bitcoin. 
The fact that the backlog could be cleared by everyone using segwit, yet people still complain about segwit not being part of satoshi's original vision shows the lunacy here. The idea that the whitepaper should be treated like some kind of bible and we should be interpreting what Satoshi would have wanted is crazy! There is no engineer in the world who could have foreseen the issues a system would run into 8 years down the road, and it's why engineering is an iterative process.
Anyway, keep  fighting the good fight my brother.

Agreed, this is blatant insider trading.

Do it! We need to make the twins rich enough so they can purchase a controlling share in Facebook and finally come full circle.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:25
Exactly, the only ones who can speculate are the insiders. I think you need to lookup what insider trading is.

If only they would have let her debate Ver during that CNBC shitshow.

I suspect you are correct, and believe I've watched this pattern happen many times in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:29:17
Yeah, I don't understand why they always report these things in points. Makes no sense to me.

This so much. Being your own bank may be empowering but it's a huge pain in the ass if you're storing any reasonable amount of money. My life has become more complicated and stressful, I now need a safe at home, a safe deposit box for offsite backups, and multiple hardware wallets. I'm very good with tech and im still worried ill fuck up and loose a bunch of money.
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:54:54
Exactly my thoughts, well said. Reminds me a lot of people trying to interpret the one true meaning of the bible.
