Not working for me either. Looks like they're having issues according to the status page.

What do you mean?

This is fascinating, but pretty fucked up the way they found him. He CLEARLY wanted to be anonymous, who cares why, he just did.

Then couldn't anyone sign with one of his known bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:02:02
Me too. I have a feeling it will be worth it and if not, I have a few btc and didn't put in more than I could afford to lose.

Maybe, but it's still fascinating.

Thanks, this is the clearest explanation I've read yet, I want to get mine off of coinbase but don't feel confident enough in how to do it yet. Dumb question, what's the big deal about being offline when you do these things?

Probably a dumb question, but what do you mean about 2028? I'll look it up right now but just didn't understand what that meant.

Yes, that makes sense, thank you. I am so interested in bitcoin and keep trying to learn more, but the technical side is a little above my head. I keep buying a little more each week anyway (kind of say yay for price drops, I don't even really care). I only have a few btc right now, but also have a lot of patience and just have a feeling it's going to be worth it, especially if I can get them secure and "forget" about them for 5-10-20 years. Thanks again for your reply. :)

I have mine in codebase vault right now and feel fine about it for the moment too. But, I don't get how you would you get them if coinbase goes offline?

@_date: 2013-12-21 06:29:18
And yep, I think you're right.

Really? That's what it means? Going to Google now, but, man...

I had this idea too, but wasn't sure exactly how to go about it. Transfer some to a paper wallet? Do you assign their name to it?
