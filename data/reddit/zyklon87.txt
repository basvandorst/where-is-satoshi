I use normal fee on mycelium and it is on ranga 52-60 sat/byte.
If you transfer to cold storage why not use economic fee, since I guess your not in hurry and you save some mBTC? But let it be known that using economic fee could take days to confirm..

I use Mycelium and works great.
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:40:33
I ordered yesterday and it worked very well, thank you.

Did you reslove this problem?
From the error of Electrum it says like "there's no coins in that paper wallet"?!
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:45:48
I use Mycelium for Android, it has features that I like and works great, would like to see to be able to choose to comnect to my own server, they promised that are working on it.
Electrum for PC, features like freeze any address, dynamic fees or custom fee etc

You could send like 0.1 BTC to that multisig address then spend it, and then load it back with coins, in this way your redeem script will be avaliable in blockchain so in block explorers you could check your multisig address and get redeem script, but this exposes a weakness that is public key, which they say in case of a quantum attack addresses that have spent/send once bitcoins and have avaliable funds this could be easy for quantum attack this address.
This is one way if you want not to "write down" redeem script, not the best way tho.
@_date: 2016-04-02 16:27:55
For Android I go with Mycelium.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:41:13
Thanks for sharing.
Do you use iMacros ?
@_date: 2016-04-03 14:30:13
I would suggest you to use payment gateway that let you control the private keys, this is Mycelium Gear which you provide them with xpub and you get your coins directly to your wallet, I don't know if GoCoin is like BitPay like convert X % of BTC  to fiat, but if it is like only accept btc and withdraw btc, check out Gear.
@_date: 2016-04-18 08:15:47
Hahahaha lol, fiverr but looks cool !
@_date: 2016-04-06 22:23:28
Hah I wasn't sure but had doubts that you are same guy from that topic question you made and upvoted that since it was good question and learned from answer of Ben from bitgo.
I am not still into multisig and I am planing to, but the redeem script that you asked it really makes complete process more dificult, however when quantum computers become really a thing there are really too much more other things in risk of course addresses that are funded with public key exposed but I think (not sure) that this will happen in near future.
Whatever you read here, please make tests with small amounts like 0.01 and practice the process few times then generate new multisig addresses and there's one good word I keep saying " Do not keep all your eggs in one basket" so few coins on hardware wallet few on multisig, paper wallets etc.
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-04-17 08:02:51
Have you checked blocktrail.com?
Few redditors mention it as good service that offers API and wallet, might good to check it out!

"simple platform for selling digital content. No need for registration, no loging, no third party involved, instant payment (we dont store any bitcoins), we are not under US law...
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:45:18
As for app check on play store for "Bitcoin Block Notifier"
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:21:13
Maybe more safe would be like this,first download bitaddress from official source then download Tails and run it as "Live boot" and you can do it offline generate keys and send bitcoins.
Make multiple backups as people lost as they forgot ta save keep private keys they simply clicked generate again, once you click generate and send coins forgot to save private keys, its done !
@_date: 2016-04-02 07:46:13
No you can't, nowadays bitcoins are mined by these "special computers" that the only thing they do is mining, one model of this 
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:09:54
Thank you!
paging If anyone host it, please let us now.
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:36:53
Yes, a simpke search here on reddit you can see the issues and how many bitcoins people lost using blockchain info and don't even ask about their downtime.
About the easiest one, I think is Copay for Android and for iOS is breadwallet.
As for mobile wallet I think Mycelium is the super-special-wallet, once you are used with it you will never switch to other wallet and has advance features that other wallets don't have and developers always keep on adding new features and always stay in touch with community to listen for new features.
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:19:16
This has already 1 confirm.

Thanks, they must make it easier, like other accounts simply "Delete".
@_date: 2015-12-26 11:45:43
If he uses Mycelium (Android) is pretty easy, and Electrum wallet.
Do not import paper wallet, but sweep the entire amount of coins.
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:19:55
One thing I suggest, do not use blockchain.info app.
Android: Mycelium, Copay, Bitcoin wallet.
iOS: breadwallet, Copay
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:43:24
Nope, how can I install them ? I thought Electrum will be installed with all packages, and what Linux is easiest to install Electrum and plugins ?
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:03:10
That address "3EwMeWSyC5ffEsxhsiDE7cybQ28KnaeTCH" it already has 0.001 BTC, you can check the balance on the link you provided, and has 6 confirmations already.
Save the "redeem script", and I would suggest to use different wallets for an easy use of multisig.
Simply transfer those 0.001BTC to other wallet, and try wallet "Copay".
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:46:34
Thanks no problem, it was my pleasure, it's funny but still I was not able to see in "action" breadwallet in Albanian.
Had an oppurtunity to check breadwallet, and did it for like 2-3 minutes as was on a rush, you can read on [this]( long story :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:38:13
I think OP choosed to send with zero fee, didn't used bc.info long time but, as I remember when you click send, you get a pop up "Do you want to pay miners fee 0.0001 ?" and guess OP choosed option "Noooo" :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:22:07
Maybe not sure, as that iphone is one of my family members don't know much ...

@_date: 2015-06-11 13:11:10
Awesome, I tryed it and worked btw you from outside US add +1 on number.
And add "$" in front of btc price.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:13:27
Too good to be true.
Market price 225$ = 1BTC
This service buys 296$ = 1BTC, this is ~ +32% over market price.

I tryed BitID for first time in Cashila and didn't worked, and reported to Mycelium and today they released another update 2.4.2, and still same bug, can't sign in and pair device with Cashila.
Can anyone test it out, Mycelium BitID with Cashila.com, create new account then go to "Pair Device" !
Tryed with bitid.bitcoin.blue and it works.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:57:46
Yeah Android, seems this is the only way to get rid of it.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:52:43
No, that would be great.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:48:25
Ok cool, please let us know when you add other merchants, especially Amazon is very used.

They said latest version of Core has been optimised and it will download faster blocks, in my experience when I installed Core the bottleneck was CPU, Dual Core 2.3GHz first blocks 2009/2010/2011/2012 was OK, when was confirming and validating other blocks it used 100% of CPU.
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:23:06
Well, that's another option missing from breadwallet.
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:42:30
Would like to try your service, is this possible in windows ?
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:34:29
Yeah since it is still in beta stage it is acceptable, as I heard that some users after get spent their bitcoins still they were able to watch stream.
As for my experience I had a problem too, I selected like 20 minutes and QR code appeared scanned with Mycelium and get "unknown format" the problem was that generated a long bitcoin amount like 0.001432349999999999999999, then changed the time to watch the stream and formated amount to like 8 digits, still awesome service but it needs a lot of thing to be improved and fix.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:54:07
breadwallet use bitpay exchange rate, and as I saw user can not change this, and still showing $4+ which is not true.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:08:46


What is "Locks" another hardware wallet ?
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:55:24

/still waiting for update on my Android :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:06:58
told you :)
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:01:24
Thank you, know I have different problem now.
I try to send bitcoin and get: "transaction 0.000343btc failed, please wait for confirmation"
Blockchain says 8confirmations, bither 0, whats up?
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:47:21
Ok thanks for your respond.
First of all this was just a test transaction, so even if I can't recover we are talking for €1 or 0.0046BTC, so it's not a big deal maybe you think I am stupid and didn't check before for password or if I have seed, but I guess my smart move in this case is that I send only 1€ :)
I'll keep trying to guess, no seed,and it's not about that 0.0046 it's more I am frustrated what I did and this could be even wors than this.
I don't remember how your wallet works and I'll ask you as I can't remember even how it showed seed.
Your wallet and others at first time install generate seed, must appear it one by one all words and force user to type all those words manually, in this way user must write down somewhere those seed words and must detect for screenshots and in some way not allow or appear warning.
I just installed it again in another device just to see the process, and first thing saw warning "Don't uninstall" "Don't forget password" "Don't clear app data" good.
After this get randmness from Xrandom camera, sound which is cool, then just shows up Seed all of it completly and I just have to tap "I have kept it safe", and done. Which is wrong.
After I installed tryed that "dumb" password and did not allow me to go further as it was weak, in this case I know that I was forced to type more complex password.
I'll keep trying and update.
You know I'll be honest, everytime I try other wallets I realise how awesome is Mycelium, 6 digits PIN, if you screw up I know they will reset it after ~2 weeks, 1000 blocks not sure ...
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:48:31
Thats like 22% fee, it's very high.
All BTM on coinatmradadar they have fees from 5-10%, and all BTM's they have on the main screen price for 1BTC, so let's say they had 22% fee, on BTM screen you would see for today 244EUR per 1BTC, while as now I'm typing real market price is 200 EUR, how you didn't notice this ?
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:43:51
I know thanks, just as wasn't sync tryed to send with that password I was thinking it correct, and before I get "incorrect password" I was getting "zero confirmations" so I wanted just to sync and get "wrong password" when I try to send and it is synced.
It's done, I cant remember, I know exactly where I was and playing with Bither, thanks and end of story.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:52:07
Haha thats what I did, and thought to comment  same !
 tell to your friend, "forced" things = not a good idea !
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:08:25
Yeah from Streamium, but that thing needs a lot of improve and bug fixing.
I just tryed that raw transaction and I got this from bc.info
    An outpoint is already spent in [89098041]
Don't know who spent it or whats going on ?
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:35:11
Thats what I already had downloaded and was running it live from usb disk, then tryed with Tails and couldn't figure it out.I'ts not everyday OS.
Started from Windows wanted to test some plugins and especially that "airgap" plugin.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:05:43
Well first part of post is explain of the situation and questions are there, but I guess you more focused on my opinion and my first impression for breadwallet.
My opinion on breadwallet is like more user friendly and not as for advanced users or bitcoiners but more for new users, which is fine and did great job.
My comparison was that Mycelium gives me more 'control' or much deeper control of everything, while breadwallet hides these on background and user don't need to worry about it.
So I compared like advanced bitcoiners which want more "control" on their keys and wallets will go Mycelium and Armory I am like this, users and I think new users coming to bitcoin world who really they don't give a fuck if they can sign message or connect Trezor or whatever other features go breadwallet and Electrum.
Maybe this is not best comparison as going to details like SPV and others but, this is kinda how I see these wallets, in the end anyone can choose whatever they want, thats the beauty of the whole this situation.
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:39:00
Thank you so much!

I don't know iPhone has been connected all time with internet connection.
I remember months ago tried to install on the same iphone, and as I remember I couldn't as asked for higher iOS version than 7, but I just tryed it today and I installed it, do you lower the minimum requirement of iOS, or I am wrong ?
Anything you can ask me for further information.

We are talking large scale attack here, even if you bought all that ASIC hardware on ebay, I doubt you would get anything near to 51% of hashpower of today network hashrate.
And as someone said that this type of attack would be better to participate on network than to try and double spend a transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:22:45
Well, don't know why do I need to but ...
Friend of mine asked me to "empty" his breadwallet, this means one tap, calculate all maximum of btc + fee, like Mycelium "Max" button.

Not just you, specific bitcoin services I noticed everytime they post new features and new products they have this problem.
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:27:51
Awesome explanation, I have 2 questions.
1. Can you provide us this tool "decrypt copay" with a link to use it offline ?
2. Can this tool be used for BitGo backup, as they provide I guess same json ?
500 bits
@_date: 2015-06-07 09:15:03
Thanks works offline.
I just wanted to test and I had two transaction with copay, and I decrypted backup with your tool and worked, what I want is to import that xprv to another wallet and get addresses that have been used, I want to re-create same 3xxx... addresses, do you know any wallet that let you set custom path derivations ?
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:49:11
    You can use our service in the following 19 countries:

Thanks, I'll contact the developer and tell about it.
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:04:20
Looks awesome with that LCD screen, let us know what performance it has after it fully syncs.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:45:33
That would be perfect, even it's kinda "hidden" feature if they will ever implement such this.
As I am used with Mycelium with that "max" button :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:03:16
Would register on reddit and tell us that you got 10$ y-day and today it's 11$ ?
Welcome to the bitcoin space, like it or not.
@_date: 2015-06-05 08:43:38
First thanks for this explanation, I'll explain more to see if we can clarify what happend (note: I'm not complaining and saying lost much coins, but this is just for test to see how it really works streamium and what happend.)
1. Yes, I send 0.45 to 123dm41A9W9qktAWaJNdqjUZeUFWnH25Yi, payed someone, correct.
2. From know, yes I payed stremium with same wallet.
3. Yes
4. Stremium maybe sent back that remaining funds to that address.
More explanation, as I got confused with that transaction script Stremium provided me and said it would be in 24 hours from now valid, I did not checked my wallet (Mycelium) and as I can see now I accepted that remaining satoshis, but is confusing me as in transaction list first on list is incoming 0.00010725 then after this transaction 0.00068992, here's a [screenshoot]( of Mycelium transactions, please let me know more explanation when you have time.
500 bits
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:56:02
The sound was good, but not great, when Q&amp;A  it was a bit hard to listen to question.
However I did this mainly to test stremium first time, was great but the player has no controls, volume up or down, or full screen?
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:31:29
An attacker with 0 hashpower want to attack network and as we know needs 51% hashrate of total network he must buy asics etc.
Question: Is it cheaper to do this attack now with 350PT/s network, or back in April 2014 when hashrate was 60PT/s?
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:19:40
Confirm it's working 
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:46:02
Sorry if I wasn't clear enough. I said "let us know" I was thinking for community here on reddit.
And I was talking for individual Amazon Gift Cards, a friend of mine has a gift card and he is happy to sell it for btc. And I saw a lot of bitcoiners selling Amazon Gift cards for bitcoins on bitcointalk.org

Cointape was a free service that you could use to see what transaction fee to set to your transaction to get confirmations within the next blocks, I know wallets already have dynamic transaction fees, but having cointape back online is much better.

@_date: 2015-12-13 23:17:26
You must wait until it'll sync 100%, and then you'll see the balance.
And I suggest to start using Electrum wallet, it's lightweight wallet, no need to download the entire blockchain so this mean it syncs immediatly and easy way to recover with 12 words seed.
If you decide to migrate to Electrum, please first send small amount of bits and then try to recover and get used to it.

Let it be known that I don't own big stash, and I trust my own PC and I am not that guy that can be tricked with a simple phishing attack but I can't say that If I am a target of someone using sophisticated tools I might be victim and you too and everyone I guess.
This was just out of curiosity when I saw list of plugins on Electrum, and this is not to use of daily basis, today failed to try it but I will do it another day.
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:06:34
I payed for like 7 minutes, then watched stream for 4 minutes and clicked "Stop Stream", I provided with an address remaining satoshis to be sent there, then streamium provided with this locked transaction, and now I get "spent transaction"
So this works, only if the streamer goes offline you will be able to get back the remaining coins, in this case like me or others when they simply don't like stream they can't get remaining coins ?

New user, never received any tip, would like to know how it works, I mean how to collect after getting tips and how bitcoin address is generated etc.
New to reddit too, I saw that r/bitcoin mentioned on coindesk.com, cryptocoinsnews.com etc often, so to get fresh news and info about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I visit first r/bitcoin.

At 6:50 minutes left I already confirmed and proceeded my transaction from Cryptsy. then "waiting payment" then "waiting for confirmation" ... I think would be good as bitpay to have 15 minutes time.
I will try again, and this time I will put my darkcoin address.
*Your deposit was not at the exact amount...*
I copy-paste amount, maybe cryptsy takes fees from that amount ?
damn, cryptsy take some fees on that balances, what a stupid service, it should take fees on the left balance of darkcoins so the transaction remain exact.

Nice, but I thought to withdraw/buy bitcoins using your service, I saw that it takes 1-3 days, for sure I didnt liked it, however while I was ready to go, I saw this notification 
I have funds directly deposited from CC, why you don't allow to buy with CC funds ?
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:51:15
Since no one responded, I tryed and deposited 5$ just for testing on this exchange using Payza, however I did this transaction exactly 7 days ago (13.November), however I asked them before and said that it could take up to 3 days to verify payment, waited till monday (17 November) and nothing, I opened a ticket and to be honest respond was within minutes and it was like this " Hello, sorry but there was some problem. But we have sent your money back. You can make transaction again. " So no email to this problem no notification so if I would not open ticket they wouldnt bother to inform me, when I checked Payza they send money back, I made another transaction 3 days ago (10 November), finally they were able to verify fucking 5$ today.
So thought to immediatly buy bitcoin, their last price was 553$ and when I checked Bitstamp last price 443$, fucking high price difference 21%, so of course wanted to limit order exactly to 'stamp price, their limit order system was stupid, wouldnt take order after just to give up my order was accepted, and thought never going to buy bitcoin with this order, however it was finished after few minutes, so immedialty thought to withdraw bitcoins after I asked to withdraw to my bitcoin address this message appeared "Cash out order was confirmed. Usually it could take up to 48 hours to receive your funds - please create a support ticket if you don't get the funds within that period."
This is bizarre in todays internet life to take up to a week to buy bitcoin plus 2 days to withdraw ~10days to complete this process, this is why bitcoin would not get mainstream soon, when you tell to someone and he/she asks you how to buy and you tell this story :)
I know about Circle, coinbase, Sepa etc services that are instant, but I dont live in US, and I live in Europe but Im not in Eu Zone.
Any suggestion any exchange that would accept Payza, limited to Payza, and would be cool as Credit Card --&gt; Payza --&gt; exchange --&gt; Bitcoin.

Well, I wanted to try Lens and convert Darkcoins from Cryptsy and buy reddit gold, however after sending Darkcoins from Cryptsy to generated address by Lens, I was waiting for confirmation, then I saw it was going to take long, I forgot that I have to confirm on e-mail for withdrawal on Cryptsy, after confirmation I saw the order from Coinbase expired already, then Lens started to wait for confirmation, and then Error API,..
Wanted to get 10$ and try Lens, I failed and no Reddit Gold, no 10$, lost darkcoins.

There's nothing wrong with Multibit, just not mentioned here much, didn't read bad review here atleast.
Electrum is most suggested here for Windows/Linux/Mac.
Mycelium for Android.
Breadwallet for iOS.
In the end you decide what wallet to use, use that one you are comfortable with it and of course it is secure, read reviews about that specific wallet.

Unfortunately this Xapo debit card is not avaliable if you live in US, reason not sure but Xapo won't ship this in US.
You can try alternatives, I have another card advcash.com not tryed it to withdraw from ATM or buy on POS yet, but they shipped it and payed $4.99 for it, but you have to load it manually with bitcoins, and another card is offering anxpro.com but it's expensive and read about it bad review from a redditor.

@_date: 2016-03-08 14:35:25
Yup, I would suggest Bitgo if you want "cloud wallet".
One thing they provide is awesome, 2of3 multisig wallet which 2 keys you got control.
Make sure you do not choose by default first option of backup, which offers 2 keys they got and one key you got, instead choose "option two" which gives you on control of 2 keys, make sure that PDF you download print it out and keep it safe, whatever happens to bitgo tomorrow with that info in PDF and your password you would be able to get your bitcoins and send to whatever address you choose, with tools avaliable that are free to download.
btw coinkite.com is good alternative too.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:00:52

*Hi Zyklon,*
*Thanks for reaching out! Apologies in the delay in getting back to you. Regarding the Xapo Debit Card, we are actually still in beta testing, which would be why you have not received your invitation to order your card yet. However, I've now added you to the list of early invites! Since we're still in beta, we've been rolling out some more cards slowly.*
*We will send out a new batch of invites in a couple of weeks: you will receive an email with instructions on how to order your card. Once ordered, you'll receive your debit card within 10 -15 business days.*
*If you have any questions or comments, please let me know!*

I have "problem" only when I receive coins from others, which is not my problem since I don't offer service with 0conf tx's.
As when I send transactions, I have no problems at all, confirmed within next block, I use Electrum!
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:41:07
Yup, simply wait.
I use Electrum wallet, in this wallet you can specify how much satoshi's per byte I want to set, I set it to 65 satoshi's for someone it might be too much, as for me I am ok, in this case your transaction has miners fee 0.01$, if I would send it my wallet maybe might spend miners fee 0.1$, but I am pretty sure till now it would have 3-4 confirmations !
And open up  and check transaction with range 60-70 satoshi how much transaction are in line waiting for confirmation, and check those from 1 satoshi to 10, look for unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-12 07:52:52
He is asking how to ship his satoshis :) lol
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:32:26
As for bc.info I see you learned lesson, same would go for coinbase too.
Doesn't matter that receive address changes each time, your account will be credit when you get your transaction is confirmed.
Your transaction has 6 satoshi per byte, check on here  your tx is on 1-10, one of the lowest fee, it will take really long time to get confirmed, simply wait and get out of bc.info.
@_date: 2016-03-10 22:28:01
Would be good, if user takes full responsibility to take 0conf tx, for services like 0.5$ I would like to be able to take 0conf.
Since when this is disabled ?
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:59:37
Yeah, you don't see your bitcoins because Bitcoin Core needs to be fully synced, and this for the first time starting this wallet it would take a really long time.
I would suggest you to download and try Electrum wallet, no need to wait as long as Core to be synced.Good luck.
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:47:34
I received few weeks ago a transaction with 0 miners fee, I was 99% that is not going to be confirmed, but I was wrong.
After ~12 hours, that transaction with 0 miners fee, got confirmed by mining pool Eligius.
Your transaction might be confirmed, if not it will take some time and droped from memory pools, or you can try and double spend it with fee, btw testing with ~100$ transaction not good :) 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:12:24
Can you tell me about transaction fees, as far as I know Copay calculates best fee before sends transaction?
In other words, have you ever got problems with unconfirmed transaction ?

@_date: 2016-03-19 13:30:32
@_date: 2016-01-27 21:54:51
I think that's it, you lost password, no backup, no mnemonic or 12 word seed.
I strongly suggest to go with: Mycelium (Android), breadwallet or Copay (iOS), first thing first, backup at the first place those 12 word seed from whatever wallet you install, and save it on the place you have important thing (no screenshots, no .txt file or on email, but write it on paper and multiple backups) and then whatever you do with your phone, lost or broken, simply install same wallet then enter those words, and you have all your coins.
Do this if you didn't already with your wallets, your coins.

How much satoshis per byte has this transaction ?
Then you can check on cointape.com to check on when it's going to be confirmed!
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:30:13
Please start and look like how many satoshis per 1 byte you payed for fee.
Doesn't matter if your transaction is large maybe 0.003 it's not enough for miners fee depends on your transaction size.
How to get tx size and how many satoshis this tx has, like this!?
Get tx hash which in this case is c073cf37acf5a9d604103534991bd297ded79156ca5cb4fd70d2887c0ae85711
you can manually calculate but I like smartbit explorer which it does it for you so with that hash search on here  paste this 0c0c1cbfff339f667e96bcb7b5609548e788b7f99b75214f2aca14bb18f79af0 and look for **Fee Size** in this case you have **13.47 sat/B** which means you payed ~13 satoshi per 1 byte.
Now go here  chech on line with transactions from 11 to 20, right now I am seeing your transaction might be confimred since it has been broadcasted from block 5 to 56, or it can time from 30 minutes to 660 minutes or ~11 hours.
And you have unconfirmed inputs, what this mean ?
Those coins you accepted are unconfirmed in the first place, so your transaction can not be confirmed before those are confirmed.

4 satoshi per byte.

I guess your answer a year ago, still it is up to date, just difference is that no LBC for germans :) but you have better options.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:21:56
blockchain.info really sucks.
Your transaction has really low miners fee, it has only 6 satoshis per 1 byte, maybe it would take some time this transaction te get confirmed.
You did nothing wrong it would get confirmed eventually, you simply send/payed and the wallet set "too low" fee for miners,consider to use another wallet you have plenty of alternatives and which one you choose, it will be better than this one.
Based on cointape.com transactions with miners fee 6 satoshi per byte, it would take this is relativity around from 4 block to 34.

Hey Mason thanks for respond, actually this script didn't worked for me, and to be sure if I have something wrong with my PDF password or anything on my side, I created new account and tryed to recover funds and same error as my main account, here's screenshot
Same error with new account just for testing, and same error with main account.
And btw the reason I am doing this is that, I reseted my phone and forgot to back up Authy tokens, now trying to recover funds using this method, failing !
However I wanted to test this method for future if anything goes wrong with you guys, you said I can do it like this and recover my funds ? Help me!

You are free to send to any wallet your bitcoins, let Core fully sync and then install Electrum, when you first install Electrum choose "create new wallet" then choose "simple wallet" then it will generate 12 random words seed, what you need to do is, take a piece of paper write down those random words like "ball white luck ..... " and click next, and you will see that you will be ready to use immediatly Electrum wallet.
Let's assume you want to send your bitcoins from Core to Electrum simple go to "Receive" copy address from Electrum and go to Core paste it and send like small amount like 0.001 let wait till confirmed, since you write it down those random words, go and uninstall Electrum then install it again and instead of creating new wallet go and choose "restore wallet" then type those 12 words click next ... and you"ll see your bitcoins back, so the only thing with Electrum to keep safe your bitcoins is to keep safe these 12 words seed.
Please only test with small amounts of bitcoins, if you screw up something I don't take no responsibilty !

I do offer services and accept bitcoins, someone send me 0 miners fee, I was about to bet that this transaction is never going to be confirmed, but it got confirmed about after ~12 hours.
Transaction with 0 miners fee, after ~ few days they will be droped from memory pool and they will returned to the sender, or sender can try and "re-send" try to "double spend" but this new transaction with higher miners fee, but this is complex and no one will lose bitcoins, except if merchant accept 0 confirmation transaction and like this one someone sends 0 miners fee and got services while transaction never get confirmed and he can spend them again, that's why merchants want confirmation.
Every time a block is found, your transaction "misses" a chance to get 1 confimration.
You can check here when the last time a block is found  (last block 6 minutes ago, and inculded 2793 transactions, within that block are transactions which are included by the miners, and miners get transactions with higher "miners fee" which this explains why they do the hard work, to collect fees.

To confirm "yes" you have to push two buttons at same time which you can do it one-handed, and it is required I guess only when you set up first time, other times to confirm transaction you can do it with a push of one button.

What OS and what version of Electrum ?
Do you have seed of this wallet ?
@_date: 2015-08-29 07:57:55


Yes, you can use NLockTime.


There's no third party multisig addresses, you can use if you want like BitGo or Coinkite, make a multisig address and use LedgerWallet, Coinkite offline tool to generate xpriv and other options you have there.


You have 24 word seed (not sure Trezor generates 12/18/24 word seed) if Trezor is stolen, broken or whatever, you must have those 12/18/24 word seed, and use any wallet that is compatible to recover, I think is Mycelium, restore coins and move to another wallet, this is it.
One really standart suggestion:
Do not keep all 50+ Bitcoins in one address and in one type of wallet, some send to Trezor, some with multisig and other in papper wallet.Do not keep all your eggs in one basket, a single point of failure.

Predicting Bitcoin transaction fees  
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:43:58
lol nice strategy, of the price.
So basically it's -10$ cheaper, as from 0$ shipping now it's 10$ 
However you are going to lower even more, I mean you had the advantage for a long time with no real competitor, now the hardware wallet is going to be interesting and seeing new high quality with screen coming the best thing is for the community, as this drives the price down and higher quality, Ledger is good alternative and cheap just waiting for version with screen, and I guess will not be $100+, not sure if they mention any price.

First thing first maybe the best thing would be to get Armory up to date and just to get your full balance, then move things where you want to go Electrum.
Don't get panic and think straight and hope you are not in rush and take a wrong step and screw everything, I think the best would be to get answer and help from the developer of Armory, and I think with the papper backup of Armory you are safe, but I suggest you to be patient and ask here  Armory Technical Discussion and maybe you get answer from developer or other users that are familiar with Armory and help you.
Then come back to us, and tell us that everything went well and got your balance back and moved to Electrum :)
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:29:52

Wallets: Electrum, Mycelium, breadwallet !
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:05:35
Just dont't use bc.info, they have all kinds of issues, thats why maybe you getting only 30% of balance, sweep using Electrum or other wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:03:08
First let them implement only notification sound than more advanced what you are looking for :)
And your idea is awesome, and maybe I'll install that app if you provide me with a link and I wouldn't like to install not secure apps as sometimes I have &gt;1BTC on Mycelium, and as for X amount of blocks have been reached I often use Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet &gt; Network Monitor &gt; Blocks, I just keep looking there what time was mined last block, no notification tho :)

They attach to the tx arbitrary message like "Visit wyw.multipleyourbtc.com and double your bitcoins!" and those bitcoin addresses are popular lot of peeps open these addresses just to watch balance and transactions, and someone might visit those website, so this is what spammers do.
I couldn't find any bitcoin address with spam tx and arbitrary message on it, tryed to find here but no 
Found on this address 39coweGgC8CPZ6hYL1BBEfc1zqbSfHsprW
 see "Public Note", this is message attached to transaction, and it'll be there forever, I mean on blockchain !
PS. Any other block explorer that shows arbitrary message attached to a tx, like bc.info showing tryed chain.so but don't know, [here]( it is same tx?

Just if I would know that a stress test is going on before I send transaction, and I would pay highest fee, as I know you can choose fee of a transaction on blockchain.info would my transaction be confirmed by now ?
Can you confirm that my transaction is propagated to the network correctly ?

Number 1 suggestion for iOS is breadwallet, you said lost phrase and can't get access to your bitcoins, this happens to all other wallets, you are 100% responsible to make sure you have a safe backup of the "phrase" so if your phone get stolen or broken you can re-install that wallet on another phone and get access to your coins.
Copay is another alternative of breadwallet,open source and easy to use, same if you are not careful and lose "phrase" same thing will happen with it, too.

This list was created in response of blockchain.info's latest issue, and it is as simple as it is, if I list API's provide by each block explorer then I must include a lot more features, so for now it just basic list, for later maybe just maybe I will create a web page and listed features for each block explorer.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:46:06
I don't know how much you want to trade, give it a try on localbitcoins too.
Here you can see the volume and bid/asks on Urdubit 
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:27:09
OTC Trade or use cash localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:45:33
Smartbit added, as for tradeblock, I wouldn't consider as block explorer can you search with it any address or tx ?

Windows 10 not sure if it's fully released or still "Preview Edition".
Ouch, whatever you plan to use it temporarily or not, keep that seed somewhere, just knowing on which addresses are those coins doesn't help.
Does this happen after you try to move coins, prompt for password, type password then this ?
Sorry hope someone has any idea and help you whats going on, these questions helps others more on what your situation is.
If you know password, I know a method of extracting xprv from Electrum then import to another wallet, this might hekp, but first let's wait if you can solve this problem "easier" !
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:54:33
Thanks, going to vacation and downloaded those podcasts and here found great stuff 
1000 bits
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:02:06
Yeah that would be cool, not for certain amount of confirmations, just for receiving bitcoins must be a sound notification !
I like blockchain.info's "beep" sound when you receive bitcoins. :)

Thanks for this explanation, however I wanted an answer which I can decode any hex from transaction and get that arbitrary message.
I found this  but seems to be nothing.
And found this  I will read it later and see how this works.
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:26:52
You can't add fee, the buyer should have add fee to transaction, good luck but with these spam attacks going on recently I doubt you can get any confirmation !
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:13:25
Blockchain.info on mobile/tablets it sucks, it has been pointed out here many times, "Latest transaction" just won't let me even tap on "search" field to paste copied address.
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:08:39
By "sweeping key" means that you must have a wallet, where do you want to send those coins ?
I think you need Electrum, Multibit or Mycelium for Android.
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:15:39
I hope that soon get a good competitor and make a product like this and this would makes them lower the price, Ledger said they going to make hardware wallet with display like Trezor.
I am not an early adaptor and don't have a stach of coins, just wanted to have this wallet and see how it works, but still maybe I'll go with Ledger first then advance to Trezor :)

Slides here 
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:27:26
Thanks, and sorry I was a bit frustrated and i was maybe a bit harsh :)
I know you are smart guys and change priorities based on the situation of whats going on, and you know the best what to do, as for me I can wait for a long time this to be fixed, and I can wait for few times if this happens (I hope not) as I like your products and what you provided to this community, but if this problem start to become more often and often sorry but I can't use Mycelium, as I am sure this spam attack/stress test is just going to be more often when they know what kind of impact they doing.


I don't really get this, are you trying to "remove" that database and use directly Core and then you can add more Core nodes so our Mycelium's have more than 3 servers to connect to ?
I think you can make an option so Core can be used directly for balance and transactions of Mycelium, in this way Local Trader and Cashila and other features wouldn't work this would be for "emergency cases" when your servers are spammed like now, people than can run their "special" Core for their Mycelium and use basic features get balance and transactions.
This way you can remove your responsibility of this spam/stress test/attack and users can run their own "special" Mycelium Core and the problem then is on another level, they cam limit transaction or do whatever they want, after that this spam attack is problem on global network of bitcoin.
I am just trying to give you an idea you know the best how to implement the best and you know how you implemented Local Trader etc, but I would sacrifice these features if you won't open source your server side node SPV or whatever it is :)
Thanks again, you are the best and good luck !
Hope you remove this red thing ASAP :) 
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:43:21
Is this app country restricted ?
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:50:33
I can confirm it's down, using Mycelium for a long time never experienced such a problem, and I have been recommending to people for a long time Mycelium.
I know some people said that it's not good as it relays on it's own servers but didn't cared much as worked ok, today I see the real weakness of Mycelium.
and your team, I know it's really hard to make a product or service and get costumers and be respected from a community, it takes so much time and work but it could take a fraction of that spent time to turn things over,and lose your users within a short period of time, change that god damn list of priority and put in the first TO-DO list to be able to select of nodes, or open source the server code I know it's complicated as you have Local Trader etc.
This stress test or spam attack it's really annoying, but I like it as it showed up few weaknesses, implementing dynamic fees, mycelium server down...
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:55:42
Thanks just tryed it on my Firefox Android and it was really good.
@_date: 2015-07-26 05:33:26
You can't really specify, I mean I use HD wallet, I don't know for exchanges.

Wow thanks man, my biggest tip ever :)
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:49:47
Finally is now confirmed, I must do some tests with small amounts of bitcoins, to send with "economic fees" then try to re-broadcast with higher fees, to learn how to do it, as this was large transaction, atleast for me so I was afraid if I can fuck up something.Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-18 11:44:24
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:18:59
BitGo or Coinkite.
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:36:57
In my case it didn't overheated and restarted, if you have this kind of problem, you must clean up your laptop from dust or add additional fan, or dump the private key from Bitcoin Core and import to another wallet and you have some coins or you have nothing.
Be careful you have 100% responsibility of what you doing, if you screw up something you can't complain to anyone.
First thing first, get a usb flash disk and copy wallet.dat then you can try what other users already suggested you !
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:56:40
What's up ?
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:48:01
I had problem with one of my transaction getting confirmed, it took 6 hours, since that day I send transactions using "Priority" mode on Mycelium with fee 0.0002
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:42:06
I noticed he mentioned warpwallet in his slides few times, and no other high secure tools we have in our community, not saying warpwalllet sucks, just don't know why not mention few alternatives but a single service that generates wallets?
Oh in the end of slides, Electrum is mentioned, too.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:01:11
I don't know, I choosed as default wallet for Bitcoin URI's on Firefox Electrum, then created HTML file with code you provided and here what I get when I click the link 
Electrum with that address as it suppose to work !
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:55:02
I don't know devs must choose the best one and make a 'standart' format, every wallet it's own format it's not good for users and makes things more complicated.
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:11:35
Ah thanks seems very straight forward, just that "Bussiness account" hope they don't ask to upgrade.
I'll check it later, thanks !
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:15:55
This would be awesome and oood for regular people who doesnt care about stress tests and doesnt want to be affected like me yesterday that my transaction didnt confirmed for 6 hours, so wallet would be good to determine and select the best fee.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:37:45
Maybe try localbitcoins, I know traders that accepts Paypal they have higher fees, but you can compare to virwox.
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:21:42
Thanks I'll give it a try.
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:18:56
I suggest for trading to use localbitcoins.com
Next time give to them your e-mail or anything to contact you directly and you can do OTC trade.

What tool to use, I mean whats the easiest way to try it out to generate brainwallet's ?
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:57:12
I usually use it to withdraw EUR from ATM's, and it works perfectly.
I used it in few stores and it worked perfectly with 0 fees, just any POS that accepts Visa cards, and not only me plenty of redditors confrimed that, dunno wtf you talking about or have ever tryed their card ?
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:50:52
Air-gaped computer transfers data via sound, one computer has mic the other one that sends data has speakers, and as far as I know this is how the air gapped computer sends and receive data.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:44:05
Is this normal to every user, I have verified account there for a long time, never used it.
@_date: 2015-07-18 10:09:08
Yeah I know few said it would take 2-3 days and then be dropped by mempool, some said weeks but as I can see it could stay for long time, wallets must implement re-broadcast with higher fee, or "double spend" with higher fee a transaction.
But I didn't get this what you said:


Let's say I did a transaction with 0 fee, and forget about it.
You said:


After my transaction "fails" and I don't re-broadcast/use those coins, how can someone "republish later" ?


@_date: 2015-08-08 07:08:50
You are right.The tweet should be "Brainwallet.org ..."

It's listed now.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:06:10
I think they used HD wallet, and these are outputs, so you have transaction from "multiple" addresses.
Correct someone if i'm wrong ?
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:51:10
Yeah I wanted to not get confirmed but already confirmed, I can do another one with "economic fee" and provide a screenshot ?
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:01:15
lol  
@_date: 2015-07-18 11:44:08
Yeah thanks for confirming, I tryed that method too, Requesting Coins, I didn't type any amount and then tryed with amount and when I try to paste on Memo, Android offers me to paste an old data that I copied before, can you confirm that even this works ?
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:38:00
Don't freak out everything looks ok, the "red" numbers are when you spent and bought that product.
First you bought 109.3mBTC (0.1093BTC) then you bought again 225.4444mBTC (0.22544444BTC) which is total balance: 334.74444mBTC (0.33474444BTC)
After you bought your product 334.74444mBTC - 0.44323mBTC = 334.30121mBTC which is perfectly ok.
If I would be you maybe I would switch to BTC instead of mBTC but this is totally personal preference.
And as you can see your total balance has changed, it's less !
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:05:28
Wow this is awesome, just tryed it on Android looks great I'll give a deep look when I get back home.

@_date: 2015-07-18 13:39:18

@_date: 2015-07-25 20:25:18
I have used WU and MoneyGram, and never used online services only cash deposit, I am not even sure how to check online with reference number, when you send money from X country to Y country, I am talking for cash deposit, you go to nearest WU or MoneyGram agent and get them cash tell the name last name and country of the receiver of money and at the time you get that receipt in your hands you can immeadiatly inform you receiver of money of the "reference number" he can right away go to the nearest MoneyGram office and withdraw money.
As I did few transaction with MoneyGram and more with WU to buy Bitcoins, this is the process and never had problems, if the dude you send money have problems, just go with the receipt and ask to them, keep the receipt don't let to them, they can make a copy but they don't need to.
Does receiver confirms that he/she got money ?
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:08:13
Yeah thanks, how I missed it, added to list !
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:49:27
Actually I just copied directly after I opened them from browser, so I guess it means if X block explorer has HTTPS it should be HTTPS here, too.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:46:23
Please add .info, say blockchain.info this makes a big difference.
Try Copay.
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:10:40
Thanks I like it and I am testing it now, permittion only WiFi.
I think this app connects to SPV node, and gets info about blocks, however I must check and when I don;t use it want to make sure it's not running on background.
I do OTC trade, so when I make transaction I set after 3 confirmations get sound alarm, so I don't need to watch Mycelium and refresh it for new confirmations.

@_date: 2015-07-16 23:02:08
My first coment here it was offline even transactions, balances and local traders, after you said these are working tryed it again and got transactions and balance immediatly but not local trader, re-launched Mycelium and couldn't get transaction and balance and nothing, tryed 3-4 times and got transaction etc but no local trader.
said they have 3 nodes, and Mycelium connects randomly to one of the nodes, and I guess first time I got connected to the node that is 100% offline, then after few times of restarting got connected to the node that is offline only for local trader.
As for local trader I don't care much I have 3 ads active for months and nothing, just hope they keep online basic features of Mycelium.
You can get more info [here]( for this problem, they are working on it.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:37:01
I am thinking about this for awhile now.
Thought to buy Odroid (credit card size computers like Rasberry Pi) and install Ubuntu on 2 of them, and use to transfer data between them using cameras with QR codes, or with audio MODEM plugin on Electrum.
Since it air-gapped how you going to transfer data to cold storage and hot wallet/watch only computer ?
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:11:31
Don't know your laptop's performance but I know how long it took to sync on my old laptop with Dual Core 2.3Ghz 3GB of RAM, it took ~48 hours, first blocks can go fast but recent blocks CPU and HDD using at 100% load.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:40:36
Just the air-gaped computer, and I think you are not using air-gap computer since you using usb stick to transfer data!

I can confirm, offline not just local traders !
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:46:57
This awesome I have been thinking of doing the same and translate to my native language and if I don't have time maybe pay someone to do it.
I have few questions for you:
1-What tools you used how did you translate, did you download the video from official channel and you used any software to 'attach' subtitles to video?
2-Maybe would be better to ask for permition of authors of that video so you don't need to be afraid of copyright strikes from Youtube?
3-Wouldn't be better to translate directly to official channel of videos, so user just can select subtitles from youtube, not sure how this works?
Asking all these questions so to see what's the best option of doing this, good work by you and good luck.

I can see you are using Linux, might be formating issue, not sure just wait someone else to confirm that is working on Windows or if you are able to try it on Windows.
@_date: 2016-02-07 11:06:08
There is a HTML version of recovery tool easier to use.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:31:15
First thing, as new user choosing Core not smart decision.
It will take some time, eventually it will be fully synced then it will show balance, you can't speed it up as it will download and validate every single transaction since 2009 on blockchain, so this depends not only on your bandwidth but also on your machine, CPU resource and RAM memory.
I would suggest to go with Electrum, no need to download whole blockchain!
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:53:19

It doesn't really matters if their payment processor takes 0 confirmation transaction, all major wallets must do dynamic transaction fees to avoid such problems, this is getting everyday problem.
Look at Ledger they already did it, Mycelium and breadwallet as far as I know working on it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:39:03
As for their debit card I have no issue with it, and I used it often.
I want to ask you, did you upgrade your account to withdraw more than 200$/€  and take off the limit of lifetime withdraw of debit card for $1000?
I upgraded my debit card but I can't withdraw more than 200€ per transaction on ATM's, dont know if its limitation from the ATM's for international cards ?

I know a lot of python tools and surprised that no one make a python script to get specific data transaction from specific bitcoin address.
@_date: 2016-02-12 08:54:15
me too!
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:56:41
All my tx got confirmed, it's working great !
@_date: 2016-02-04 12:49:46
So it's like 2.0296% difference/fee ?
I really hate hidden fees, I would really like to tell me in the first place like "this is fee x %" rather than trying to hide it and promote it like "0% fee service".
I used to use another service and "Bitcoin 0%" fee, when I checked their bitcoin price it was like 2.5% difference comparing with 'stamp andother exchanges.
It's acceptable that no service can run without fees, but simply tell your users what fee you charging, it's better i think, and I think for 2% fee for rebit it's not much comparing to other "send money home" services like they charge much higher fees.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:00:56
No no, I don't need blockchain database on my phone, I need an app that uses any block explorer API and displays my search results, this can work better than using explorers on browsers !
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:04:41
I use Electrum everyday, like it and few months ago when few spam attack or stress tests going on I set to 65 satoshis per byte, some might say too much but for me it is in the first place to get confirmation in the next block, dont care for few more cents if I spend on miners fee, but I understand some do not want to set such high miners fee.
As for wallets I know that some has has implemented for dynamic fees, but I better check on cointape sometimes and just check what range of fee to set, I always see 60-70 satoshi free on mempools.
 did your tx get confirmed yet, out of curiosity?
Yeah checked on tx id and its confirmed!
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:40:11
Ok, first thing first blockchain.info sucks!
Second this problem might not depent on you, as I don't know the situation what you've done with these coins, let's assume you bought from someone.
And the problem is from other transactions that are not first confirmed and those unconfirmed transactions send to you, so you have to look back to get confirmations from that transaction then you'll get confirmation.
Here's  and with 1.7 satoshi per byte fee, not saying is never going to be confirmed but it's very low, and lot of nodes are not seeing it, from this list  I barely found from just few block explorers, what this mean ? This is that miners not going to see this transaction and it might be droped from mempool, if you bought from someone it's their responsibility to take on this case and send again you coins if this takes awhile to get confimred.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:00:02


Not at all, someone cracked lot of brain wallets, how you sign transactions from that cold storage ?
I'm going to create an air-gapped cold storage, thats what I am asking if you could share ?
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:48:30
Go to About &gt; Connection Logs, and check on what node got connected, restart and randomly Mycelium would connect to a node.

At "Transactions" click on "show more" you'll see red notice "(Input unconfirmed)"
And few block explorers, can't see your transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:08:17
Yeah, now what you recommend me an alternative of Mycelium, with "Bitcoin wallet" even copying addresses not working, and missing a lot of features.
Once Mycelium fixes their issue with their nodes it's going to be ultimate Android wallet.

Ah that's different from me.

If even would have 1BTC fee, can't be confirmed before this  transaction gets confirm.
You have an unconfirmed input.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:13:19
1. Can you share transaction hash?
2. Use Electrum wallet, it's much easier dynamic miners fees etc
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:19:25
Not sure but, thats not how an air-gapped PC should transfer data with USB stick, however that's your choice.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:20:58
Definitely wallets must implement dynamic transaction fees, like Legder, so you and me my friend don't need to worry before every transaction to check if any spam attack is going on and add higher fee.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:12:57
I work in post office and we have MoneyGram services too, you have receipt that tells the amount you pay the fee and the receiver of money you send, this is proof that you give X amount of money and don't worry, manager can't pocket money as easy as you think, maybe he/she can try it but it will be in a big trouble, you keep on looking on your transaction for anything go back with receipt and talk with them.

Can you provide me a link of No Script add-on ?
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:45:37
Tranfering data with USB stick could allow an attack like Stuxnet virus  and read this 
So send data with USB stick back and forth is a no go for me, I would transfer maybe by scaning QR codes or using some tool to transfer data using audio signals, something like this  not this app for sure :)

Interesting, does it count only blocks with 1 transactions as "empty" ?
I think it would be more precise to check on blocks size and calculate how full blocks are, like we have blocks with 700kB some 900kB

Consider to try Electrum, download it and create new wallet and first thing first backup 12 words seed.
Send 1$ from Core then send back to Core get used to it, it's really simple it gives you really good features like to set miners fee etc.
Delete Electrum and re-install it, select restore wallet and type 12 words seed, and see how fast you will be ready to use your bitcoins, its leightweight wallet, it syncs in seconds.
Now when you are ready you can send all your bitcoins and just back up 12 word seeds, before you do make sure when you create new wallet your computer is not infected with viruses or malwares you have plenty of good suggestions here on reddit.
And it's always good not to keep all your eggs in one basket, so use papper wallet, electrum, hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-19 18:06:44
Yeah, Electrum uses this 
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:08:48
Awesome, so Coinapult is only for fixed fiat escrows, I get it now thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:37:51
I suggest to use light wallet like Electrum, you can always dump private keys from this Core wallet and import to Electrum.
Seems that Core can't open socket and listen to port 8333, backup wallet.dat !
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:39:35
I don't think BTC, look he is using mBTC !
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:27:53
Still with their 3 nodes problem.
I don't use Local Trader, actually I got ads but no one never was interested, as for other features of Myceloum I have to open and close app for like 4-5 times to get rates and connect to the working node, you can check on logs to see which node you connecting to, its random.  
I tested and restarted Mycelium till I got rates and transactions and it was connected to "mws2.mycelium.com" node, check on logs and see on what node you are connected to?

What wallet is this that doesn't include miners fee ?
I suggest to use Electrum, as for this transaction just wait or you can try and double spend it, so you broadcast another transaction WITH miners fee and it will be confirmed.
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:46:24
Great, does this mean that cointape.com or this service is going to be runing for good now, as developer shut it down as he said it was consuming too much resources to keep it alive, then I asked the developer of cointape (Christian Papauschek) to open source it and maybe someone from community would host it, funny thing is that before he open sourced it, a lot of redditors here were ready and said they'll host it, Christian open sourced it, no one hosted it, nice to hear that now 21.co got and it'll keep it alive really informative service!

I gave to my friend for wedding on envelope cash + bitcoin papper wallet, before I did this I talked to him and told about bitcoin, it's been more than a year and obviously he throw away maybe papper wallet and took cash, before I put papper wallet in envelope I took a pic of private key, pic is still on my phone and bitcoins didn't move since that day, didn't ask him wtf he did with it. :)
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:21:28
I don't know how you calculate "a decent fee" but using cointape.com this isn't a "decent one".
Your tx has 15.77 satoshi per byte and this to get inculded in a block it would take time ~ 5-300min or from 2 - 18 blocks, always acording to this 
As for blockchain.info no comment, if anything goes wrong that aint a surprise!
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:39:00
Thanks, listed now.
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:37:50
Yeah, here it is 
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:40:34
This transaction does not exist on network, you can check it by searching for it here  or here  or any other block explorer, there 0 balance on that address.
To be honest, I didnt used for awhile now Bitcoin Core, and don't know, but a possible solution would be, to export private key of that address on Core that cointains balance and then sweep to Electrum that you could install within minutes (no need to wait to sync like Core ) then send to Coinbase or whatever you want to do it, I would suggest you to stick with Electrum, send few mBTC and back up 12 words seed write it down, delete it and re-install it, restore with that seed and check how easy it is to restore etc.

You can create/generate your own seed from various tools online but download it and run it offline, and it's compatibile with Trezor standarts of generating HD wallet, then use Trezor to "restore" that generated seed that you got from X tool!

I backed up, but I lost my back up (let's pretend), how can I create another back up of personal wallet again (1 of 1) ?
Would be great to add a button, or user can add "!" to the amount of btc to send, to send the maximum amount of coins (- miners fee) to an address.
When I want to send an amount of BTC/fiat would be good to be shown on vise versa of that amount, ex. Send BTC 0.123 ~ USD 27.74

That's really huge range of price for a "quick version" as you saying, $20 is cheap, and $100k is expensive, I took both edges of this price range you set, however would like to know more precise price, just the developing part, not licenses and legal part of this business.

@_date: 2015-09-02 15:31:29
Mycelium I know it let's you spend uncofirmed tx's, but I won't select this unconfimred tx and send to an exchange as it wouldn't get any confirmations.


Thanks for recommendation, I'll check it out after I get this fixed.


I did payed him cash, he said if tx would not confirmed we will "fix" it, we will contact.


I know him, actually he sended bitcoins when he was home and I was my home, and came to me and payed him cash, so it's not someone who I dealt with first time.
Last question, you have been helpful thanks.
Would it be possible to re-bradcast with higher fee that same tx, saw few articles but they just get hex of transaction and use pushtx to re-bradcast it, didn't notice any changes on fees.
But now I see it;s more complicated, he has a unconfirmed tx before my tx. fuuck..

I don't know very much about BIP44 and BIP45 derivation paths, but would be great to most popular wallet apps make an agreement between you guys and use same derivation paths, or multiple derivation paths do allow people import BIP44 import and Mycelium would be good to allow to import BIP45.

When I get out for Otc trade I want to have same address as Ledger on Mycelium.
I got xpub from that demo API, imported to Mycelium and I don't get history of transactions, and I get new address ok, go to addresses listed here  after typing 24 words seed, and I confirm addresses are listed corretcly comparing with your Chrome app, but when I check and look for address generated from Mycelium by that xpub, can't find it.

Do not compare in USD, check first time when you make request how much btc, and how much btc you received in your localbitcoins wallet.
Say for example now to a seller $155 =  0.605469 BTC, so you keep looking at coins you will receive, and you should get exactly that amount of bitcoins, as soon as you make request to buy that amount of coins goes to escrow automatically and after seller confirms payments, just releases the coins, and you get coins in your LBC wallet !

I fucking did, and did OTC trade, I know him and after an hour said to him that it's going on a spam attack and I don't have any confirmation yet, he said it would get confirmation hopefuly, lol didn't even analysed transaction with all those inputs/outputs.
Whats your prediction on this to get confirmed, should I ask to reverse the payment, get back my money ?


Can you be more specific which one, sorry for all these questions ?
Ah, yeah he send all these bitcoins from a lot of addresses didn't wait to get confirmed and send from that address to my address, so bc.info let users send unconfimred transactions ?

@_date: 2015-04-12 13:22:02
I see your comment that you said "bitcoind autogenerated new wallet.dat", and I think this other file wallet.8931892189.bak is actually your old wallet.dat, you have to rename it to wallet.dat but before doing so, simply wait till it will sync with this new wallet.dat.
Otherwise you should keep always a backup of wallet.dat, and as soon as you get back your coins, get rid of Bitcoin Core, not the easiest wallet to use, you have plenty of options there !
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:18:05
Yeah got it that he is re-spending unconfirmed tx, edit my post above.
I have done few OTC trades, and he said anything goes wrong or not getting confirmed contact me, I'll be patient for maybe an hour and ask him to get this fixed.
Another question, this tx is sended to Mycelium (my wallet) how can I select specific "inputs" (or outputs should I say?) that I don't want to pick up this unconfirmed transaction, I want to send to an exchange and won't get my coins delayed for this tx.
I am thinking to import xprv or use seed to import to  Electrum, and "freeze" that address that is receiving this unconfirmed tx, and use others to send all bitcoins to X exchange, of course with highest fee possible ?

@_date: 2015-04-24 15:41:57
Thank you, and thanks for the tip :)
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:02:21
Let me explain is that what I am trying to do is get xpub key and import to Mycelium, I won;t get my Legder with me when I do OTC trade.
Now I used  choosed BIP32 and copy-pasted Mycelium Wallet Path as example there     m/44'/0'/0'/0 and I get all same addresses after I typed 24 words seed,that's perfect.
However the BIP32 Extended Key or xpub generated on the same tool that mentioned above is not correct, as I import to Mycelium and not giving me same addresses, to prove that is not the same xpub, when I co-sign with Coinkite I see the last 3-4 letters of xbup are different.


I choosed subkey index 1 (default).
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:26:24
I am sorry and hope you get back your coins, just careful as trying to recover you might even get worst, as someone mentioned that RAM "overwrites" data, not sure for this just read in comments.
However you should ask an expert about this, since you might have a chance on recovery, and since you offerin 20BTC this must be a big chunk of coins but sending all of them without confirm and re-confirm that address that's just weird.
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:52:51
After I created this list of block explorers  for some reason I liked chain.so, but I see now that their hash rate of pools stats are not correct, they missing biggest pool AntPool and I like Eligius is not listed there, but some bitcoin addresses that are unkown of some pools are listed.
As for pool hashrate ideally would be max 5% share of hashpower of any pool, and would be great to have geographically distributed, 100/5= 20 mining pools :) but this is just a dream of I guess any bitcoiner :)
But i think we are going to see even more centralised, a lot of ASIC companies like Spondoolies-Tech I think it was very respectful and with good quality products and they are not selling ASIC's to individuals anymore, they partnered with Genesis Mining and only offering cloud mining, fuck it I want to have my ASIC in my home and hear that sound and clean the dust of ASIC and contribute to the network, profit wouldn't be  priority just to pay off that electricity bill I would be happy to let it run, however with all these sign home mining and centralisation is knocking !
I'll create another GIF with blocktrail.com another day :)

I was looking for Spondoolies and they had a product "SP20 Jackson" dedicated for home mining, I don't know what happend they clearly said on their website that they are working with another company and will offer only cloud mining.
However tryed to open their website and it's down now, cached version opens and saw this  
It's really disappointing that Spondoolies is not offering products for public,as their product have been really solid and never saw anyone complain or any shipping dealy, specially home mining.
For now I don't know other option maybe is Bitmain with products Antminer S5 and recently S7, I donnt know if they offer it for individuals or only buy it as batch, I don't know if they have delays shipping their porducts but I know a lot of big mining farms they use Bitmain products.

I think this is the best way to kinda promote your product to people who are still not sure where to save those 5 or 10 or 100 btc, when they see this, they'll be like "Damn he keeps his 800+ coins there, I think this is safe" :D

I am fucking nervous as I have headache now.
I don't think he set lower fee, but default one, and I gues maybe used iOS blockchain.info wallet, told him million times not to use bc.info wtf can't force to not use it.
The dude send tx with size of 619bytes, and 10k satoshi fee, so it's like 16 satoshis per byte, which comparing to this service  I am no near of any confirmation.
Can you please or anyone else can he re-submit that transaciton with higher fee, and possible get confirmations ?

In this case, could I use CPFP to get confirmed this transaction?
user -----&gt; tx 20sat/byte (unconfirmed) ---- my_client tx 113sat/byte -----&gt; me (waiting for conf) 
What wallet to use CPFP or make raw tx and use coinb to push tx, in this case is it usable, its child of child ??

Well, I dont know how Apple/iOS works, but in Android as other redditors told you we don't have this problem, as when I click a bitcoin payment link say from BitPay, I have option to select from which wallet to open that link, and I have like 7 wallets, I installed to test them out, and choose the wallet that I have funds and proceed with no problems.
When it opens automatically Pheeva, do you have any option to change that option in iOS that when you click bitcoin link to open X wallet ? So this way you can choose what wallet to be "by default" or simply transfer all funds from your wallet that you think you don't use anymore and let just that wallet that you think it's awesome, so you have no problems.
For me and Android, I think: 1.Mycelium 2.Schilbach's Bitcoin Wallet

TAILS has Electrum 2.0 pre-loaded as you know, and makes things easier, and let it be known Electrum is pretty "easy" compared to Armory.
Multisig is that way that Electrum is doing it, that to you looks difficult, when you create your let's say 2 of 3 multisig wallet, and you trying to create 3 wallets in the same computer it's not the right way doing it, and when you want to spend some coins, you think that you simply sign with 2 wallets in the same computer and broadcast it, you can do it, but you making a single point of failure, which in fact multisig want to avoid it, if you do it like this simply use normal wallets.
An easier way of doing multisig is creating your own multisig then providing xpub keys to Coinkite, I can try and make a guide but first we need to talk what ways which wallet etc., as it is not 1-2-3 steps and you must do it right way multisig, as doing it wrong, you make it single point of failure.

Yeah, best way is to check it by yourself, btw in the end I think that better is to re-create new seed/wallet with Mycelium.
You can check and restore your Mycelium seed on those tools/wallets, and this implementation of HD wallets (seed) is called BIP32;
Go and download this tool is open source and save it, if you think that one day Mycelium is going "poof":  download 
Try it with Electrum wallet: 
Best way it to try it by yourself, if you have spare android device, install Mycelium save 12 words seed, send 2-3 transaction back and forth like 0.5$ and 1$ small amounts, go install and download those wallets/tools above and try to restore that wallet !

I dont reeally know, but lately have been hacks going on especially bitcoiners that used TOR, they used TOR to access blockchain.info and it has been suspected that TOR exit nodes could be doing MITM attacks, so TOR not always secure, stick with HTTPS :)


I don't really understand question but, the best way you to understand Electrum multisig is to install 2 Electrum, one on your PC and one in a virtual machine, you can use VirtualBox or VMware and play with it, test it out with small amounts like 1mBTC send over to your old bitcoin wallet then you can understand.
Here's how it looks Electrum generates lot of 3.. addresses, but Im testing it myself right now as Im not very familiar with multisig wallets and ran into some problems :)

Heard of Mycelium ? You can export xprv key so easily, respect to them, no need to code, no one needs te code to make their own wallet just to export private master key as alreay there are wallets that have this option.
They can provide this feature and before exposing it, telling to user that they are exposing master private key and this is risky and with a warning, I want to take the risk, ok go ahead.
All this is just of incompatilbility of wallets that each one has it's own standart of seed, of signing an arbitrary message etc !

You don't need to censor it, you actually hide btc address but forgot to censor QR code, which I can scan it and get but I didn't since why do I need it, to send bitcoins ? :)
You don't need to take down picture, its ok !
Next time, you should transfer bitcoins to any wallet for example Electrum for Windows, Linux or Mac or you can use Android wallet Mycelium, then shop what you want to buy, check out and pay with Android wallet Mycelium you scan QR code and it should not be a problem !
Reason is that Coinbase can delay with withdrawals and you have specific time to pay that bill usually 15minutes, what happens when Coinbase sends that amount of bitcoins after 18 minutes ? That's a problem, you need to contact costumer support of Bitpay etc.
So next time Coinbase ---&gt; Mycelium or Electrum (or any other wallet) ----&gt; Pay the bill, no problem !

After restarting it, at some point it freezed out, and I killed process, then re-opened and prompt me to Create New Wallet wizard, create one just to get started, tryed to File &gt; Open and "Main_Wallet" could not been seen by Electrum, it renamed it to "Main_Wallet.tmp.5674" renamed it to "Main_Wallet" and open it from File &gt; Open, and synced, sometimes I have problems with syncing, I just keep on restarting it, it's annoying but wtf, I guess this malleability attack going on causing nodes to crash.

Well I re-installed Armory as you guys told me and did not work.
I started Core normally with wallet, than asked me to rebuild blocks database as Armory rebuilded for their usage, it's been more than 12 hours rebuilding Core blocks database, didn't knew it would take so long.
After this Armory will rebuild blocks database I will clise and run Armory again, if it's same problem I don't know.

Try Armory, BitGo, Coinkite, Electrum test them out yourself, and choose that one that is easier and offers best security, which in fact all of them offer high security if you follow instructions.
And test with small amounts like 1mBTC, make transactions few times, till you see that you understand and you are ready to go full multisig, let us know what you choose and how it's going.

@_date: 2015-10-11 14:42:13
When did you make that transaction right now ?
You transaction must be included in the block when miners "find" new block, this could take from 2min up to 1hour or more, it really depends on what miners fee "you" or your wallet included, if you sended from Electrum it has a pretty good amount of miners fee, it has by default 50 satoshis per byte as far as I know.
If you want you can post your tx link here, or if you won't PM me your tx as you might not reveal you tx as of your privacy, I could tell you an "estimated" time when you tx will get confirmed, "estimated" on quotated marks as I can't and really no one exactly tell you when you are getting confirmation.

Re-using bitcoin addresses on Mycelium and Electrum and I believe in all HD wallets it's ok I mean you can use same address as many times as you want since your wallet controls private key of that address and no worry.
Re-using address is just for privacy issue nothing else, you'll get your coins 100%.

Mycelium, Electrum and Ledger Nano.
Mycelium is great, however had some issues with their servers they promised us that they'll update so we can choose our SPV nodes to connect to.
Electrum, great wallet lightweight, sometimes I had a bit of issues with it too, sometimes don't want to sync, I restart it and it works, another issue I had with it and freaked me out a bit, but if you have seed no need to freak out but whatever, the issue was that it freezed out, I know my laptop has issues lately, and did "end task" forced killed the process, when I re-opened prompt me to create new wallet, wtf I created and immediatly wen to File &gt; Open "Main_Wallet" file didn't existed, wtf went to Electrum wallet folder, found file Main_Wallet.tmp.5674, I copy it to another folder, and go renamed it to Main_Wallet, go to File Open &gt; Main_Wallet and reloaded successfuly my wallet &amp; my coins :)
With Ledger wallet still not using it fully, wanted to try it with Electrum couldn't do it with Windows hundreds of depencies, python and shit with Windows I know you can't do this stuff easy asked for help here, no one hjelped me as for that Chrome app, I don't want to use it, don't I don't like it, I might migrate to Linux distros like Ubuntu.
So far and hope never lost single satoshi :) Well I could lie as send like 0.001 to Bither andrord wallet, forgot password, stucked there and deleted it.

I don't have public IP, thats the reason ?

First "mistake" is that you downloaded Core, as not supposed to be for begginers, not a big deal just you must wait to sync fully and validate every single transaction since 2009, and this if you have low performance PC/laptop it would take 100% of your CPU power and take really some time.
If you feel sure that you can do exctract private key from Core and sweep to another wallet like Mycelium(Android) or Electrum (PC/Mac/Linux lightweight wallet actually you should have installed this one, no need to wait for sync) then go ahead and do it, however you are 100% responsible of what you do, so if you fucked up something, you are on your own :) 
Good luck, let us know when you're done.

Now I started bitcoin-qt without wallet and -chckblocks=100 parameter, it started ok, when I run Armory normally from shortcut, as I have both on same disk, here what I got 
Armory want to kill bitcoin-qt, then it will start it, or ask me to run it, not sure, then it will start to rebuild blocks Armory's way, should I go like that ?
I am afraid it rebuilds blocks, then I close Armory then open again and got fucking Initializing loop, again ?

It's cool, I mean the growth.
I don't get just how another similar service couldn't take even 1% of market localbitcoins share.
They have 1% fee of trading, and that's insane do a math and check that out.

So the problem is on my side, can you PM me maybe which server ?
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:57:02
Yeah I can wait, just a question is there by any chance that these tx can be droped by mempol at some point ? 
Let's pretend that these tx has beend droped, by this correct me if I am wrong all nodes at some point have been rebooted and these tx has been cleared from memory ?
If this scenario above could happen, what will happen with coins, "the sender" can get back coins ?
Just out of curiosity:


How exactly ?
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:00:18
Yeah I will let it initialise but it should not take hours ?
I see bitcoind.exe is listed on processes list then it dissapears.

Normally the payment processor detects immediatly incoming bitcoins and marks it as paid wuthin seconds.
And depends on from what wallet you send, hope you don't use Circle as it will take some time to process withdrawls, you should use Mycelium for payments like this.
ps nice how you censored btc address :)

I downloaded yesterday and still syncing, and I was wondering how to do it without wallet, let my laptop all night to sync and it was going well sync was going so fast, but I dont know now is going so slow getting 1 block per minute.
I have two questions:
I. After I sync can I run without wallet as right now taking too much resources of my laptop ?
II. Is there any way I can change peers/node that I am connected, maybe it can download blocks faster ?

Just "Synchronizing..." for 2 minutes now, and no green light on the corner, this is will all servers, seems to be issue on my side, Electrum 2.4.4
Finally it is synced now. Rebooted it, I did before but no success.

Well said, sir!

Thanks for detailed answer.
I got it synced and works ok, yes it is v 2.4.4, I rebooted it and it synced ok, I did reboot it few times before no success, however now works with different servers.

Localbitcoins, Mycelium Local Trader FTW
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:20:32
As for Trezor, best answer is to contact Trezor support and ask them directly, not a Trezor owner, however someone here might give you an answer.
As for coins that you have in Coinbase, if you are not familiar with Mycelium and Electrum, I will suggest you to withdraw like 0.1BTC from Coinbase and play with wallets, Electrum and Mycelium and see how their work, create a wallet with one of these and backup seed, delete wallet and try to recover it, make sure how it works and familiar yourself with those wallets and when your Trezor arrives make same thing, don't transfer all your coins till you learn how to do it.
@_date: 2015-03-23 00:52:29
You can't be scammed since you will use cash and you have to meet that trader, and decide a public place.
Check on their profile on localbitcoins, check feedback should be 100%, number of confirmed trades: 100+, check for when their account is created should be 1y+ etc, you have traders in US.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:06:05
Thanks for this info, I have like 7 wallets on my Android, and tryed so many web wallets and kinda lazy to try this Ninki but I guess I will get it a try.
Now exploring multisig, generating offline 3 wallets and using any web wallet using xpub keys, so far failed to use Electrum --&gt; Coinkite.

I might suggest, bitgo.com, coinkite.com

If you are developer and want direct access to blockchain yes, you need it.
IF you are simple user and don't give a fuck about the whole blockchain simply want to send/receive bitcoins, this is the way to go.
1. Electrum 
2. Multibit

As for path I got it from here this  
And your path gave me exast same receiving address, thanks again.
I wanted to import to Electrum from Mycelium as wanted to select from what unspent outputs to send bitcoins, I did with xprv restore just thought is it possible to get mnemonic from xprv but I see now.

Nice, glad that you moved coins and no issue, btw if you don't use Core or not plan to, you can delete it as it can take space up to 40GB, not sure if it's 40GB, but you can check it out.

Not using Bitpay for anything, bitrefill generated invoice using bitpay thats all.

However, OP has plenty of options to choose to recover his coins other than Mycelium.

Can I buy online ?
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:10:18
I think the easiest way is to install Mycelium (Android only), and you can scan QR code of private key that got from ATM, and then you can sweep those coins, once they are confirmed your coins moved to Mycelium wallet.
At first time install Mycelium makes you backup it, so make sure your write down 12 or 24 random words.
Then from Mycelium you can send so easy or  buy online or whatever you want !

I wanted to create 3 multisig wallets and upload xpub key, I know you can use their offline tool but wanted to use Electrum --&gt; Coinkite, but they require to sign text "Coinkite" from that xpub key, which with Electrum you saying you can't, here you go a screenshot, asks to enter xpub and sign "Coinkite" and signature base64 !

If we were able to generate addresses like you think full:
You'll accept payments in that address, someone just go and generate same address:
And yeah when you generate bitcoin addresses you get public key, and private key, then .... you get the point why you can't do it, buy you can do it 2-3 first letters like:

I just installed it, I have both xpub keys (master Keys) of 2 Electrum wallets, Im entering correct password of Electrum.
One thing that possibly can cause this error is that one Electrum wallet,that I installed on VMware I can't get it to sync, while virtual machine is having internet connection, can this Electrum wallet that's not synced, but I dont think this is the issue.
Can anyone confirm that can sign a message with Electrum multisig ?
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:12:54
Good, hope that takes more share and even other similar services will be created and take share and this way lower trading fee, and decentralize things a bit.
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:43:49
Thanks, I already did sign and got signature just wasn't sure if its in base64, as I need to sign 'Coinkite' and to provide signature but I got error when I submit signature from Electrum, I am trying to import my three xpub keys to coinkite.com.
I'll try tomorrow again, 3:00AM...
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:49:33
Well I have lot of requests for new features, like:
Custom miners fee to decide how much satoshi per byte, like Electrum's feature.
To be able to select unspent outputs, or 'freeze' selected outputs, again like Electrum's feature.
Would be cool to have an option like 'Expert mode' and to have advanced users options, to have more control, I don't like wallets like breadwallet which are send and receive feature wallets, which I understand for major of users thats enough, but I like more features.

Unfortunately I don't run my own node, but I think soon but I am thinking to have a dedicated machine just to run node, and I have other plans, like to use for my own needs for SPV etc.
Doesn't need to be web app, anything that it notify me that block has been found, I am surprised that all these services no one has come to make such simple web app or whatever...
If you don't mind and have free time, if you could explain a bit more how to use Bitcoin Core so when new block is found to call to play a sound .... ?
As for bitlisten.com, how I didn't noticed that when you un-tick that "Transactions" actually it disconnects from the node, no way to get info for new blocks :)
