Literally getting robbed in plain daylight. The fees are exorbitant and they give fuckall back to the country and its people.
If you want to withdraw or deposit significant sums of cash you need to let your bank office know multiple days ahead and pay a ridiculous fee - I wanted to withdraw 20k 2 months back and the fee+interrogation made me look for alternative methods. 20k € really isnt that much.
If you are running a small company (and not something like a supermarket) and want to have a debit/credit card terminal for easy payments they will charge a stupid amount of money per transaction.
Then you remember the fucking TV commercials ran by the same banks saying that paying with a card is so nice, easy, clean and cheap and you reach for valium.
They only keep their physical offices open during working hours so if you want to go for consultation you have to ask for a few free hours from your employer. Additionally they are closing ATM-s and physical offices to save on costs.
All the money they earn is "reinvested" aka embezzled back to Sweden.
One could say that we should be looking for their competitors but all the banks in our country are exactly the same because our government is a bunch of wankers who dont do anything to stop this travesty.

Because all they do is inside trading - its a rich boys club with only members interests in mind.
They got filthy rich or saved their accounts because they had an inside line to Mark Karpeles.
Do I need to go on?

You are legitimately autistic if you think this is the first thread about this issue.
