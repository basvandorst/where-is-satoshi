Simon, pls rather say that you're from South Africa. Not to be a hard arse, but saying you're from Africa perpetuates the tendency for Americans to think of Africa as one giant country/place/collective where everyone knows everyone.

Another point: These ETFs that derive value from a futures contract are not great at getting exposure to the underlying price of btc given that they inevitably trade in contango as the futures get settled. I looked into this a while back for VIX. I’m not an expert on these matters but maybe someone else can chime in. It’s better then nothing, but ultimately an ETF that actually holds coins on its balance sheet is the best.

You get synthetic ETFs and those that are physically backed. Synthetic just hold collateral generally in the form of stable blue chip equities or stable usd assets. I suspect that COIN will have physical btc on its balance sheet. 
The ETF would then be exposed to price of bitcoin if synthetic and would have to enter into derivatives to hedge their position. Doubt there are enough instruments to do that for them or enough markets.

I've thought about this quite a lot lately. We don't have an exchange big enough and with enough volume to allow SB to provide their clients with liquidity. Unless they funnel all purchases and disposals through BitX and drive volume. They could also act as market maker and hold their own hot wallet. But they'd be exposed to price volatility on their positions.

For those battling with the Paywall:
Losing to win 
Jun 23rd 2014, 20:26by G.F. | SEATTLE
IN MOST elections, if you win more than half of the votes, you call the shots. In the land of Bitcoin things are a bit more complicated, as events last week showed: although a huge coalition of computer users managed to control 51% of the system that underlies the crypto-currency, the group did not abuse its majority. Instead, many members decided to leave and join rival group
The beauty of Bitcoin is its complexity. It is a system of systems aimed at solving one of the more nagging problems of the digital realm: how to transfer something of value from one person to another without middlemen needing to make sure that the item is not copied or, in the case of money, spent more than once.
One of these systems is what is known as “mining”. Its function is to keep Bitcoin secure: a global network of hundreds of thousands of computers commits bitcoin transactions to a public ledger (the “blockchain”) and ensures that they cannot be altered later. Technical details aside, the network does this by solving fiendishly difficult digital puzzles. And whoever finds the solution first, wins a reward, currently 25 bitcoin.
In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was done by computers owned by individuals. Some wanted to donate computing cycles to the cause, others to make some bitcoin on the side. But when the value of Bitcoin started to grown in early 2013 and real money could be made, mining became an industry. At today’s exchange rate the reward is worth about $15,000; collectively miners now make about $2.4m a day, down from more than $5m in late 2013 (see chart). What is more, to avoid getting overwhelmed, the Bitcoin system automatically increases the difficulty of the puzzles as more computing power comes online. As a result, most of the mining is now done on computers packed with custom-made chips and by a handful of mining consortia, pools of computers whose owners share the reward.
On June 13th one of these consortia, called GHash.IO, managed to muster more than 51% of the computational capacity of the network, which caused a mild panic in some corners of the Bitcoin community. It not only meant that GHash.IO could win most of the rewards: the more computing power a consortium has, the more bitcoin it can win. But more important, if a consortium controls more than half the computing power on the network, it could theoretically exercise dictatorial powers over how transactions flow.
The threat was described by Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer, both of Cornell University, in a recent blog post. The majority party, they said, could block transactions from ever being committed to the ledger, whether between specific parties or to or from a particular Bitcoin address, such as those known to be owned by exchanges, venture capitalists or even individuals. Or it could extort huge fees to agree to commit transactions to the blockchain. In effect, it would hold the keys to the bank vault.
But none of this seems to have happened. As was the case when the majority threshold was approached in April 2013 and again in January 2014, many of the miners in GHash.IO moved to competing pools; the share of GHash.IO has now dropped to about one-third. And it is easy to understand why: if bitcoin holders really worried that the system could be gamed, many would head for the exit and the value of the crypto-currency would plummet; a consortium’s investment, which can collectively reach hundreds of millions of dollars collectively, could lose much of its value.
That is not to say, however, that the consolidation of mining isn’t a fundamental problem for Bitcoin. It was developed as a system without a centre: no central bank or other authorities control it; trust is unnecessary and cryptography wins all. Yet the fact that any one group can exceed the 50% mark means that trust must in fact be placed in someone to do the right thing.
The mere fact that GHash.IO did retreat as soon as it had passed the 50% threshold doesn’t prove that Bitcoin is protected against a takeover. An outside actor with enough cash and a strong ulterior motive—an intelligence agency, say—could try to at least destabilise the system by amassing lots of computing power. But it would have to spend a lot of money to do so. Currently, the computing power on the Bitcoin network is 1.35 zetta flops (sextillion Floating-point Operations Per Second). That is 5,000 times greater than the power of all of the world’s fastest 500 supercomputers combined. Matching this would be expensive indeed.

I've thought about this too. From what I know, the SEC could approve or reject the application now. To try and read into the fact that they havent said anything yet, leads me to believe that they will, but are engaging and dotting their 'i's' with COIN management and 3rd parties to ensure that all above-board, and getting commitments on the part of COIN to adhere to certain requirements.
From what I've read on /btc, is that the ETF is automatically approved come 11 March if the SEC has not explicitly rejected the application.
I'll likely get some fiat on an exchange to buy cheap coins if application rejected as I believe quite strongly that the price would revert to a mean price more indicative of the true value of btc
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:50:08
When you have more people wanting to buy, than people wanting to sell, that generally comes through in the price, but only when on an open exchange, with limited liquidity. All demand by the managers of the ETF could satisfy their need for btc, through an OTC type trade with some big hodlers. I can't see the Winklevii opening a Bitstamp account and moving $3 billion.

If I'm correct in saying, I think what new people to btc dont understand is that you cannot regulate btc. Bitcoin is distributed. Bitcoin will continue to exist for so long as people (anybody) wants it to.
What can be regulated are the institutions or activities that allow fiat to interact with btc, eg: exchanges, money transfer, etc.. So sure, regulate the selling of btc and the running of an exchange - require people to do AML and KYC...but thats not regulating bitcoin

thanks very much. I suppose this affirms my own views around the current stalemate with BU. Satoshi didnt contemplate the evolution of hashing and the centralization of such computational power. I think  what we have now is a totally new animal, and maybe its time for people with differing views to part ways. If you ignore where you came from and look only to the future for your core/BU, then neither is wrong or right, just choosing different paths and their own fate. I dunno
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:58:49
they want to control BU blocksize. Call it whatever you want - semantics. Why not let them hardfork...amicably.
Core can be core, BU, BU....ignore the name.
But maybe you're right.....does it matter. There is an issue re: governance. People dont feel like those who essentially govern over them are making the best decisions for their interests. Right or wrong, it's their view. In a population with differing views, people choose and people vote. So why not a hard fork? I dont know the answer, I'm just bored of character attacks.

For bitcoin cash, if you open an account at BTC.com you can import your private keys and it'll move your coins to that wallet. From there you can move to somewhere else. 
I've always had success with Breadwallet for importing private keys as well. Then move coins to an exchange to sell, or whatever. If you're new to bitcoin then read up first as I doubt you can sweep only a few bits from ur paper wallet. If you bugger it up - all coins gone. Make sure to deposit bitcoin cash to a bitcoin cash address - NOT a bitcoin address.

I'm confused, so is BIP149 entrenched within the latest version of Core? So BIP 8 is to be implemented as a UASF mechanism? Is that a done deal? So worst case scenario (miners dont do anything) we get a soft fork in 2018 with SEGWIT and miners can mine the SEGWIT blocks or mine some Alt?

Makes sense when you consider how the Naira got a new one ripped by the USD. Also exchange controls and USD shortage at banks.

I suppose one miner is a perfect substitute for another. A 'User' is not necessarily a perfect substitute for another.
Miners operate within a prescribed and finite course. They can only do one thing.
This sounded good in my head, but may be complete bullshit.

Everybody else dumping their Alts - or - a more reliable store of value in crypto.  If people want to stay in crypto or exit an Alt, you often need to sell your Alt and buy btc.  It's not easy to sell Alts direct into fiat.

This whole uasf fascinates me. So much game theory, especially for miners. Seems like nothing to lose if you're a miner. 
Where do most of the miners sell their coins now? Which exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:49:16
So is there an expectation that with the increased difficulty in the years to come that ASICS will no longer be the most optimal, or even effective at mining? and that some other chip would be better?

My guess for the record. SEGWIT implemented. No HF. Complete retraction from the miners.

One thing that Andreas said a while back in a speech was how money was now "information". Bits, 1's, zero's...roll some dice, generate some random numbers and anyone on the whole planet can be part of bitcoin. Its not exclusionary. 
I found this quite profound. Also that guy with the Boston accent, doing Youtube videos, did a video once on the large numbers involved with btc, such that if you create a random private key on a generator, you'll be the only person ever, in the history of the world, to ever see that number. Roll again, and that number that was there will never be seen again.
Also, the idea about how bitcoin is the biggest hacker bounty on the planet ever. Satoshi's btc is sitting there, ripe for the taking. We all know his public key. Yet nobody has ever been able to get it. Andreas has talked about btc being the biggest hacker bounty ever, which speaks to its security and robustness over time

Ya, but I'm forever seeing people talking about editing config files, and getting dirty with code, which is where I dont want to go.

Remind me again, how do you ban bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:54:31
Yeah, I'm also waiting for the massive exodus from Alts into btc when the shit hits the fan. Btc required as no USD offramp out of Alts and/or people flight back to quality. I think the Alt carnage will be brutal. Might just take some consensus/compromise to be reached on  btc scaling debate.

What he said
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:01:40
So if you don't signal, then you mine some Alt on some other chain?
Does this then mean that SEGWIT is guaranteed? So the readiness window period is really just a period for advanced warning for implementation? use it, Dont use it - SEGWIT is being implemented.
And then this would still be a UASF, but the assumption is that the economic majority would want it, so the theory is that the economic majority would not end up with some shit coin, vs the miners, as the EM want this
EDIT: So then where does Core stand on implementing a UASF using BIP8, I know that Greg Maxwell wrote a post about not supporting BIP 148 UASF

Yes, but this assumes markets are efficient - which they may or not be. They are in some respects but not in others. Markets also trade on sentiment notwithstanding perfectly discounted cash flows and such. Which allows people like value investors to ply their trade

What happened to Roger Ver's state of mind? I mean, I saw a video of him in tears talking about the atrocities that 'the West' imposed upon the weak and defenseless. This guy was/is obviously passionate about bitcoin and the change it could bring to the world. But then from sense I get from this community, he went full retard and now tries to undermine the community. Is this because he doesnt agree with how they're doing things, or did he just go nuts? Thanks in anticipation.
