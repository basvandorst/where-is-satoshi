same issue. 16 hours later 0 confirmations. This sucks
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:55:28
I had a dream it went to $80 and bounced to 11000 or something. All my dreams have been crypto lately though
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:38:36
Awesome thank you. I just set up my wallet on Coinbase and have $100 USD of bitcoin now, finally got started with this
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:59:15
Been to this twice as the beef o' brady's bowl, pretty exciting
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:10:34
How does a user receive bitcoin through a reddit comment? Where does the btc go?
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:01:19
thank you! :]
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:42:06
How many bitcoins do most of the users who frequent this subreddit have? I have .22 right now, just started last week and don't know if now seems like a good time to buy at least 1 full coin. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:52:38
Just use coinbase. It's really easy
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:40:37
There you go, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:04:45
Thanks for the reply. I wasn't sure if I should have asked as I understand it is a bit rude/awkward, but couldn't help but be a little curious to see where people stand. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:08:31
This is actually a good thing.
@_date: 2014-08-25 14:50:04
Would this cause the price of bitcoin to drop since overstock would be selling their coins immediately after they were received? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:06:11
What is this referencing? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:53:21
RemindMe! one year
I've never tried this before
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:02:44
um ya
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:10:07
less than that I think
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:39:24
This is gentlemen 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:21:29
I still have no idea how to get my coins from coinbase vault to offline. Once they're offline how is that more secure? What if I lose my password or my hdd crashes? I don't really understand this still
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:03:31
Thanks for making this clear. I am still unsure that carrying all of that data on my phone is safer than the vault in coinbase. I need to decide on what I feel is safest
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:35:04
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:10:00
But not until we have somewhere as safe as a bank to store the coins and an easy way to access and spend them
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:10:55
 [Last bull market it was a bit different.](
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:01:32
The chart is the actual price. It doesn't lie. What are you talking about
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:54:41
Retail and fomo consumers aren't aware of this and won't buy until a new ath is reached
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:00:16
Log scale
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:06:27
the worst kind of correct..
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:43:14
Yeah. I bought in at $660, so I'm not too happy yet.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:03:00
Just hit 1650, I think the 16s might be gone soon too
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:34:38
How do I do this?
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:13:20
Whats the easiest way to do this? I don't want to hold on to all that myself, how do I know I can keep it safe on my own
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:48:48
What makes you think that
