That's building on 2 enormous assumptions.  1, that it will solve anything.  2.  That anything *needs* solved globally.  People discuss "crypto" currency with as much or more disdain than "fiat".  Humans still want the ability to hold their money and even swim in it like Scrooge Mcduck, they don't want a 25 word password that they check only to find out all their shit's been stolen anyway and the theft can't be reversed or traced.  That just ruins lives and makes people enraged.  As bitcoin grows, and the fees grow, and the volatility grows, it becomes less and less usable as a real currency.  Why do you think Steam dumped it from a payment option?

The only thing that seems to be constant is that what is considered a  reasonable debt ceiling keeps rising.  It will rise to infinity and eventually everyone will just shrug their shoulders and keep on business as usual.  If you told 1950 america that we would in the near future hit 1 trillion in debt, people would build bomb shelters and start moving, meanwhile we've hit 20x that and nothing is changing, inflation went up but so did the average wage along with it, bread was a nickel, now its $1.99.  In 1950 a new house was $8400, now the average home is $250,000 but the average Joe yearly salary got bumped up to 50 grand this year.  What will happen when the debt keeps going up?  So will everything else.  Anyone who takes this *seriously* and is concerned with future proofing themself shouldn't be worried nearly as worried about investments and bitcoins, they should instead be buying property far away from metro areas and cities with access to clean well water in a climate where they have the ability to grow food year round, and a big godamn fence.  If the shit ever hit the fan in your lifetime, water, food, shelter and gasoline is way more important than any kind of money on earth.  You will become the richest man for hundreds of miles because you won't starve to death nor be forced to stand in bread lines with your weeping children.

That's kind of a strange assumption to make because bitcoin has never held a smaller market share of all of cryptocurrency, especially as the new year rings in.  Sure there's plenty of bonus's and tax rebates coming, but don't bet even a *third* of it is going towards bitcoins.  People want to watch their money go 100x, not go up maybe 20%, bitcoin isn't the place for insane gains anymore.  And each year that passes it's tech and use cases become more dated and limited.

That's why we spend more on welfare programs (almost a trillion) each year than most other countries entire GDP combined.          
               
We also take in far more immigrants than the other mentioned countries in that list you gave, and a huge number of these are on government programs the moment they get their foot in the door.  We're far more generous in this respect, than say, Canada, Japan or France.  There's a lot more poor immigrants flocking to our doorsteps then theirs and we take them in.

Well that's not true, the government gives 790 billion (read almost 1 trillion) in aid to its citizens a year in welfare, food, government housing and government safety net programs.  It's probably the best country in the world to be poor or homeless in.  If you're poor in India, you simply die starving to death, if you're poor in US, you go to school and get free breakfast and lunch and have shelters with free beds and warm soup every night, and food stamp cards to keep eating all month.

The nature of compounding interest in the stockmarket gurantees a profound snowballing effect until the snowball is crushing mountains.

Nope, the biggest players from investment banks would get out quietly and dump all holdings, 12 hours later you would see the announcement.  Or, even more likely, knowing the cut off date is on the horizon, they would first setup a method to short the entire crypto market to make a huge profit from it's impending doom and then make the announcement.  It would allow them to kill a competitor and make a giant profit while doing it.  Then they clink their glasses with laughter knowing, not only did they kill a competitor, they got to screw a specific portion of the population who trusted the government and banks the least.  As they explain to Trump that these people are anti-american and don't trust the dollar (the dollar that he lives for), not only will he go along with shutting down bitcoin, he'll do it gleefully and probably get some money through back channels from all the profit gained by shorting the entire crypto market.  In fact, it may have been allowed to be added to the CME just so there becomes a legal way to short the whole fucking thing.

No because stocks represent a growing company with real growing assets that provide something real to the world that the world wants.  And even in the event that the company fails, the 200 million it held in assets, buildings, parking lots, retail space, etc, can be liquidated and dispensed among the shareholders.  Bitcoin has no assets to liquidate and no product to sell the world, the only product in its menu is the selling positions in the mighty ponzi.

The only reason anyone buys bitcoins is because the ROI for selling it in the future.  The only reason it could sell for a lot more than you paid for it is because a sucker was willing to buy it at the new price, hence the only way you get paid is by someone else (see: sucker) entering the ponzi at a higher price than you willing to buy your coins at a price higher than you paid.  It's a decentralized ponzi scheme that only grows as long as suckers exist to keep buying in.

 Are people really going to pay a $125 fee every time they make a single transaction with btc?  Naw, instead what will happen is people will realize btc is a sham, isn't worth scaling upward and it'll be swapped for something that *does* scale and have no fees.

Actually I know exactly what both are.  Bitcoin is the new age Ponzi.  But unlike most ponzi's, it is mighty, because the people who believe in it believe devoutly.  It's current value reflects how many people have cashed out of the ponzi or are buying in to the ponzi.  When more people are selling their ponzi position than buying into it, the price goes down, when more people are buying into the ponzi than selling out, the price rises and every now and then there's a market correction of the price because too many people have bought into the ponzi all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:46:13
And they've been correct, just because a ponzi has longevity doesn't stop it from being a ponzi.  It is a mighty ponzi, it's followers are devout and their mantra is to HOLD, this is an important mantra else the entire thing collapses as there are fewer and fewer people buying into the ponzi at the current going rate and as I write this it's marketshare of the crypto world is shrinking rapidly.  There will come a moment when the holders of the ponzi abandon their HOLD mantra and you will witness an enormous collapse of the ponzi, and idiots who don't know it's a ponzi will buy back in at 1000, etc because they know it will be a series of collapsing waves where ponzi profits can be made each time as long as more people are willing to temporarily join the ponzi.

Because the whole world is already built around it.  Governments can't even buy oil without holding American Dollars.  You can't pay debts with bitcoin, banks don't accept it.  And bitcoin is only 1 federal announcement from being useless.  "Due to profound illegal activity around the globe from human trafficking, drug trafficking and tax evasion, Bitcoin is now officially illegal to accept as payment for any business in the United States.  Then the United Nations gets involved and pushes every business globally to stop using it.  Suddenly it's nothing but a meme and overnight it's intended value as a currency becomes more useless than fiat paper because at least fiat paper can be held in your hand and used to buy things or settle debts, bitcoin can vanish like a ghost within 24 hours.
               
Remember when wikileaks broke and the US government forced Visa and Paypal to refund all donation transactions being sent to wikileaks because they didn't like Julian Assange?  They could just as easily shoot down bitcoin if they simply *decide* they don't like it, and when you realize bankers and wallstreet have considerable influence on the white house, I wouldnt be surprised if its coming sooner than later.

Everyone who cashes out higher than they bought in is technically an accomplice because the entire thing is a decentralized ponzi that only continues to work if a new sucker is found who will buy into the ponzi at the ever increasing going rate.  The moment that there are no more suckers who will buy into the ponzi, the entire thing collapses with everyone who's holding a ponzi position scrambling to get out at once and ending up with nothing.  When you participate in a decentralized ponzi, the number one mantra you must pass on to the followers is to HOLD.  This prevents a mass sell off faster than suckers can be found to keep buying in.  It's the glue to keep the ponzi growing.

Because USD is real and can be used to pay down debts.  Banks dont accept payment in bitcoin.  You need dollars, and you need dollars to buy bitcoin in the first place.  The only reason people are excited about bitcoin is so they can temporarily use it to make more *dollars*, because thats the currency of the land.               
                     


                                 
Or the price of apples went down.  Or the supply of apples is too high and they need to dump them on the market before they rot and get nothing.  Bitcoin's sudden rise is 100% about the hype of bitcoin, it sets a new record, the media reports it, 1000 more people buy in, it sets a new record, the media reports it, 2000 more people buy in, it's riding a hype train, it's relationship isn't to the dollar, it's relationship is tied to media reporting.  When media reported Mt Gox went bankrupt years ago, bitcoin crashed hard, etc, bitcoin didn't crash because the dollar was strong, it crashed because the media published something very negative about it.  It has nothing to do with the dollar going through some kind of crash, but people *are* opting to crash their bank accounts to buy into the present hype.

Yea, Volkswagen, Bosch, Fujitsu, these fortune 100 companies all have their head up their ass when they test run Iota for 3 months and then all went forward with implementing Iota in their product lineups for 2019.  These multi-billion dollar companies clearly didn't do their research and need to consult u/antilex on flipping to an antiquated bitcoin method that doesn't transfer data, doesn't scale up in speed, it scales down the more traffic it gets, and every transaction always has fees guaranteed.  They need to see the light and fire all their legions of experts and board members who spent months of time testing and deciding Iota was an amazing fit for some of the biggest companies in the world.  These guys clearly have no idea what they're doing amirite?  If only they could consult u/antilex to find out the hidden secret that all their testing with millions and millions of free transactions was all an illusion, it was merely a hallucination and the entire project was secretly a "dumpster fire".

The email thing was absolutely in Iotas favor, firstly DCI isn't MIT, but it's frequently advertised as such, DCI is in fact heavily invested a competitor to the data marketplace that Iota created and their alleged security flaw they claimed to find **could not be reproduced,** by their team or anyone else, and is in fact a broad issue that exists in all cryptocurrenty, its not specific to Iota in any form.  Even though this was laid out and admitted, just for kicks, when the Iota team asked DCI to provide the mathematical proof for a case to reproduce the alleged flaw they were unable to produce any answer.

It's funny to me how many young people will so assuredly *think* they will be holding over 2 million dollars when they retire.  I think less than 4% of the working population (people who work for a living and weren't born with wealth or received inheritance) will ever see that much cash in bank at one time.  In most cases, you'd need to begin *maxing out* your roth / IRA account without failure for 45 consecutive years starting at age 18, which means never being laid off or having a disruptive break in employment.  And then you'd need to reach age 65 without you or your wife or your children having any major medical problems or emergencies requiring your to pull it out prematurely or stop being able to contribute.  How many "if's" are in that statement?

ALL of crypto is a long shot, but there are divisions to be made between ones with more promising use cases than others, and a division between who has already mooned 14 times and who hasn’t.  Iota is in a cross section where it’s high on the promising use case side, high on the developer talent side and hasn’t already ballooned from multiple moons.  To my mind, this puts it in a different league than most shit available.  I think it’s one of the best bets in the game.

I think you need to dig a little deeper about how even the biggest skeptics have begun to crown Iota as the closest effort to solve the trilemma.

When you buy 1 Miota (the unit that trades) it breaks down to 1 million Iota’s.  A company buying 10 Miota for today’s value of $4 total, has 10 million Iota units to use for submitting transactions on their backend service.  Imagine the enormous mathematical difference between having a million credit card transaction fees vs spending a few bucks up front to have the means to cover as many transactions with zero fees instead.  And not only that, you can use them as a wrapper to submit data packets as well.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:50:03
Exactly, that’s why I like certain non-shit alts.  Like take the controversial Iota for example.  $13,300 invested would buy 33,250 units at today’s value.  If it turns out to be even 5% -10% of the backbone of Internet of things machine transactions by 2022-2025, the market value could cross a couple trillion.  If it did, the value per unit would balloon to $719.  719 * 33250 = 23.9 million dollars for 13k invested today.  Bitcoin has already had multiple “moons” and already been force multiplied out.  There are legitimate projects which haven’t hit their 1st moon yet, but have extreme potential to do so, and legitimate talent behind them.

To shed some light on a topic you clearly aren't read up on.  One of the 3 parties hacked was Silverstein properties.  Larry Silverstein owned the trade center buildings, he bought them and was suffering huge losses and also became had a huge asbestos problem with both buildings and building 7 which estimates were going to cost between 1 and 2 billion dollars to remove.  Asbestos is already very expensive to remove just in someones garage, nevermind multiple 100+ story buildings.  Suddenly 2 months before the planes crash into the building, he updates his insurance policy to specifically cover "acts of terrorism where planes fly into the side of the building".  Wouldnt you know it, Larry has all the luck, 2 months later, Lucky Larry's failing buildings that were full of asbestos, are demolished by *exactly what was covered in his insurance,* which he updated only 2 months prior, and he thusly received **the worlds largest insurance payout in human history up until that point.**  Somewhere around 4 billion dollars.  I'm **very** interested in what they've uncovered with the insurance company internal talks between insurance companies and Larry Silverstien, and who knows what else involved in all the murky waters of 9/11, the attacks, the response, and the trillion dollar war that was waged with the enormous detour of Iraq for no reason.  I'm just going to bet right now, this may be the worlds largest paid ransom in the history of mankind, because it would disrupt reality and piss off basically every American, and every single family in the middle east who lost a loved one to the war that started from it.  It would also create a cascade of trials that would get a lot of people in trouble, far beyond the 3 companies that were hacked.

Silverstein was one of the parties hacked.  Just for reference, it's public information that Larry Silverstein, the owner of the trade center buildings upgraded his insurance policy to include coverage specifically for "attacks of terrorism by airplanes crashing into the building" approximately 2 months before the planes crashed into the side of the building, giving him the worlds largest insurance payout in human history.  What amazing foresight Larry had!  Im very interested to see what they found.
Larry has at least 4 billion dollars from that one insurance payout to contribute to the hacker fund, I'm sure he wouldn't want the world to know he had foreknowledge of planned attacks on his buildings, and foreknowledge to not show up to work that morning when he was normally there every morning bright and early.  I'm sure people would be very upset to know that the landlord was happy to capitalize on profits while potentially, knowingly let all the fucking residents inside die while he cashed out 4 billion dollars on a tragedy he pretended to not know was coming.

Foundation holdings would be $0 if nobody was buying them to raise the value, but millions of real people *are* buying other coins because they believe in them.  Bitcoin is slipping, all the original talks of 100,000 - 1 million + per coin were in the context of no competition.  It has an endless sea of viable and better technology competition now, and every waking moment, more people are realizing it's not the necessary pillar they thought it was.  I'd expect the down trend to continue unless the news can drum up a bunch of clueless noobs to dump their money in ii, but I think now, the news is already awake to other options as well and those days of hyper pumping btc is over.  Now begins the legitimate downturn for real.  I'd bet within 3-6 months, ETH will surpass btc in market cap.  Not because people are over the moon excited for ETH, but because many btc holders will flip to ETH in fear of a sinking ship, causing ETH to take the crown.

Bitcoin is battle tested, and it won't *vanish*, but anyone who thinks older tech will rein as the king forever is either delusional or high.  I like bitcion, but when I view the comments in r/bitcoin, it's very much like a cult / religion.  There's an excessive amount of delusional fantasies getting people to make irrational decisions.  If you wanted to put a grand in bitcoin and buy a lambo with it, you missed the boat, you're showing up to the prom 8 years late.  Bitcoin is not going to hit millions or even a hundred grand, be happy it ever got as high as it did.

bitcoin noobs need to recognize the power of compound interest.  7-10% gains in stock market doesn't sound like much to a total fucking noob, but when you realize the nature of compounding interest and compounding growth, your $5500 a year contribution equates to 6000% gains *reliably* over time when you cash out to retire.  Because it's a lot easier to score 7-10% gains *reliably* than to pray your schlitzcoin goes to the moon.  You *need* 6000% gains just to keep up and then you gotta pay 15% capital gains tax on it when you yank it out.  My roth IRA doesn't get taxed when I pull out those sweet gains later in life.  I say do both, but your bare minimum, baseline investment should be a tax sheltered IRA fund.  First find a way to max that $5500 each year, then whatever shillings you have left for investment, consider some high risk / high return crypto, but don't go crazy.

Robinhood is mostly used by **DAY TRADERS** with small pools of investment.  Day traders are all about scoring micro gains each day and when something they temporarily buy into drops like a rock, they all scramble to get out at once, because all their efforts for months and months of grinding micro profits of pennies at a time vanish in the flick of a moment.  Anyone **holding** (not day trading) at an older price doesn't need to freak out because they can hold forever until the time is right, but anyone day trading for a micro gain is in full panic mode when the line falls off a cliff like this, and their collective actions cause it to fall faster in the short term.

From 20 straight days of falling, I have a super secret hint, these things don't ever fall down to zero unless it becomes a declared scam, which it isn't.  I don't want to piss on your parade of cheap prices, but there's a damn good chance you'll never see $6000 again in all of 2018.

That's interesting but what worries me is how fast the tech is changing and evolving.   Many of the coins you been investing in could easily be obsoleted by better tech in 5-10 years and meanwhile, with a standard Roth IRA, you spread it among a hundred giant companies and they keep going for centuries.  Because a company can change to the tech, but many blockchains infrastructure is set in stone and / or takes too long to successfully port to something different before a competitor takes all the cheese.  So you could easily be plugging 22 grand into it for 4 years and all of a sudden it drops to zero because a new wave of tech outperformed the original coins by a factor of 100.  Roth IRA picks should be something that isn't going anywhere, crypto is too new and moves and changes too fast to be picking definite 30 year picks.

Being totally serious for a moment.  Here's what I personally believe.  
                 
1.  Crypto is in an infantile state.                
2.  Crypto will fundamentally change the way financial world and the data market place functions.                
3.  The most important one.  I believe based on the previous 2 points, that crypto will be worth more in 1 year, 3 years and 5 years + than it is right now.  So I buy.  It's a fucking no brainer for me.  It's the easiest buy in years now that governments around the world have acknowledged its existence and welcome it moving forward.               
                  
A lot of people have their head up their ass.  They're watching it change pennies this way and a couple dollars that way.  Just lock in a position now for the coming years.  Time in the market is better than timing the market.  Wake up from the coma, buy the dip and relax.

The $8000 ATH happened naturally, organically from standard investors in the crypto space, the 20k ATH (I think it was 20k for all of 0.4 seconds) resulted from a globally televised discussion across all television networks creating hyper pumps that weren't natural or to be expected in the crypto space, over half of those noobs have already fled screaming.  the 60 day ATH is a relevent benchmark to work with and it's currently sitting a grand above that after all the bullshit pumps and dips.  BTC is sitting pretty, it only doesn't seem fine if you were one of the retards buying at the peak of the televised fervor.  It'll keep growing and you probably wont be able to buy it much cheaper than it is now.

It's becoming far less predictable as certain alt coins are actually presenting better technology and better use cases for real companies than bitcoin.  There was a time when everyone was just a copy of bitcoin, today with things like Iota and Nano, the landscape is changing.  Zero fee crypto is good for businesses, and Iota takes it one further by being the only coin on earth that scales UP in speed the more traffic it gets.  I don't even see it as an "alt" to bitcoin, it's a different offering entirely built on different technology, it tossed blockchain in the trash can, IMO, and will eventually be sitting on its own pedestal for others to be judged against.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:22:24
What alt coin is doing worse today than they were this time last year July 2017?  They're almost all the same order of magnitude higher one year later as bitcoin is from exactly 1 year ago.
July 2017 - Iota was $0.24, now its 4x higher                        '
July 2017 - Etherum was $261, now its $431, almost double, etc
What alt coins are having bloody days compared to bitcoin 1 year ago?               
Almost everything is up dramatically, bitcoin isn't showing any mystical gains, it's actually losing ground as more people distribute out of bitcoin vs how much bitcoin was in portfolio's a year ago.  They lost a lot of marketshare.

I hate to say it, but you obviously haven't followed up on anything your saying and seem to have no idea about what Iota does, and what they're already doing.  They're already doing more transactions per second and when they run stress tests asking everyone to submit at once around the world, the speed of transactions scales up, this is the only crypto on earth that increase in speed the more transactions it gets, because you can't submit a transaction without first confirming 2 pending ones, so the more people submitting, the faster the confirmations come flying in.  It's a needle that keeps going up, frankly, it makes Bitcoin look retarded and dated and when combined with the fact that it's free to submit transactions letting you literally send 1 penny to someone else and they get the whole penny, it's going to blow up micro transaction possibilities for companies around the world.  Bitcoin is a ticking bomb waiting to implode on itself for lack of realistic use cases.  
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:05:48


It isn't a side chain of bitcoin, it isn't trying to be nor does it want to be.  It ditched the plague of the chain entirely in favor of $0 fee transactions and a network that increases in speed the more traffic it gets.  Are you smarter than the billionaires managing Volkswagen, Audi, Porche, Lamborghini, Bosch &amp; Fujitsu?  Because they're already on board with Iota as their crypto of choice to hold, store and transmit data as well as funds all around the world for zero fees.  VW is rolling out 2019 model cars with sensors that transmit over Iota, you're going to start seeing the Iota logo everywhere in actual products.  Fujitsu is revamping factories to use Iota to monitor the production chain.  As far as real world use goes, Iota is ramping up to be one of the most practical cryptos that are actually useful to big companies and you're comparing it to old bitcoin blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:07:44

Have you ever done the retirement math before?  Even if you wait till age 65 to retire, you must assume you have 30 more years to live.  So let's say you built up 2 million dollars at age 65.  That means you have less than 66,000 to spend per year or you go broke before 95.  Then realize the cost of living by the time you're that age will be much higher than it is today, as well as the insane cost of healthcare for seniors.  So if you wanna talk shit about retiring at 30 or age 40, just shut the fuck up.  You can't even have that conversation without at least 10 million dollars and even then you won't be buying fucking lambos unless you're a certified retard.

It's not "Plagiarized" if the programmer who did most of the work allowed her to have the credit.  They worked together knowingly and that was their arrangement which he was ok with.

Story time.  I've put out a simple bar code scanning app for our company on iOS and Android.  My first version was accepted by google Play and available in play store within 72 hours of submission and a $25 fee.  Apple beat around the bush for 3 f\*cking months, forcing me to make subtle changes and then dissapproving their own recommendations and making me put it in the enterprise section instead, so I could distribute it myself without using their store.  Apple cost $400 to not even end up in the apple store and an additional $300 each year to remain on enterprise plan to distribute myself through our website.  Moral of the story is, Apple isn't any better at security, but they're much better at completely ripping you off a shitload more money for something that's ultimately worth less in the end.  They're a designer product, they're Veblen goods.  They charge premium American prices while having China do all their production, they keep 300% of the savings and charge you prices as if it came from a boutique, custom American made artist signature series shop.  Fuck Apple.

Apple is a nightmare to develop for, no wonder windows has a million times more software titles and games available over the years.  Apple is the NAZI dictator of technology, they actively do everything possible to cut out all 3rd party repair, all 3rd party chargers, all 3rd party hardware upgrades, and they make their software loaded with DRM and put the load on the developer to force new signatures and change provision dates inside it and repackage it every year, they're just a fucking nightmare, and all the nightmare sources from their insistance on total dictatorship and total control of every profit angle.

The powers &amp; media are reacting to 4 giant companies suddenly accepting bitcoin as payment and trying to make America feel like it's a bad idea to actually spend your crypto, so that other businesses can't follow suit and also accept bitcoin.  If no one spends it, no one can accept it, and further legitimize bitcoin.  They want to paint a message that you're an idiot if you use a crypto for real world purchases.  That's the strategy by bringing this guy out again and again, and again.  A lot of powerful people are getting scared that giant corporations are suddenly accepting bitcoin, and who knows what else in the future.  Their best play to counter this?  Keep bringing up pizza man who lost opportunity money by using his money for real world needs.  Remind America over and over again that crypto is A).  Risky and B). Stupid to spend it.
