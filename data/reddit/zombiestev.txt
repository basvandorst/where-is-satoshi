A lot of modern phones are going to be like that, not just sony.

Apply for a circle invite, or wait until they go public. They're apparently ramping up invites. Or, coinbase if that's a possibility.

Or, it could be used to receive payments easily without a mobile wallet to be transferred out later. Of course there are other methods for that too though.

It seems to be around the same as using virwox, which is the method I was using before because I don't want to link my bank account. I may start using this instead. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:56:41
Awesome!

I like having an account readily made for alts, the occasion I get paid with them I don't need to look anywhere else to make a wallet.

Circle.com verification is pretty easy/quick then it's instant buys right after that. Purse.io is another alternative but you pay a little bit of a premium there

If your account is newer or you changed your password recently they will delay it a bit.

I had this idea not long ago and started it but never finished making it, maybe I should!

I haven't even been doing big discounts, mostly just penny pinching a little. 6-8%. Not really worth the risk and this most recent one is going to be my last from them. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:51:46
Shit, I've done a few purchases on Purse. So far my buyers have had 100% feedbacks, but shit. I'm worried.

Virwox is probably one of the only reliable paypal methods to buy bitcoin(although indirectly). You buy SLL(Second Life Linden) and sell that for BTC which you can then withdraw. You pay a bit of a markup though and it can seem a bit confusing.

I've had the opposite experience. Coinbase asked tons of verification questions and circle took SSN alone as verification. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:21:18
virwox.com allows buying with paypal, but fees are a bit higher and it's a bit indirect and confusing. You buy SLL(Second Life Linden) and then trade the SLL for Bitcoin. 
Tinkercoin.com allows for use of credit card, but they are currently closed for orders and preparing for a bigger launch. 
Bitsimple.com seems like it allows for it, but I can't test for sure because it's not available in my state. The other two methods I've personally used though.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:42:05
Fees or not, It's still a cool thing to have imo
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:04:09
Circle allows debit cards for instant buy, where coinbase does not. That was my issue with coinbase and I love that circle allows it. :D

I had the same idea the other day but I'm not really sure where to start. Coinkites api has a BTM example though
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:30:24
Same referral link as OP, loooool
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:15:50
Have you tried circle.com? 
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:19:02
I can see why localbitcoins wouldn't be easy for some. Either no local sellers or paying a huge markup for 'convenience' kind of makes bitcoin an unattractive option

Coinkite shows failed login attempts and last login location

I've yet to do it, but I'm pretty sure they give you a barcode that the cashier is able to scan.

Didn't mean to karma whore if that's what this is considered, I was just excited and wanted to share the excitement a little. I kind of expected more downvotes tbh, either way I don't care about that. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:17:13
Exactly, seeing people's reactions for the first time using it is great! I showed my dad how to use it when I was visiting him for his birthday, and his reaction after paying was "Woah that was weird" because of how quick and easily it was paid for.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:01:00
So I just ordered a few PS4 games and accessories with this, the whole process was smooth. Awesome. :D

I think Coinkite offers an end-of-life planning thing, it sounds mind of like what you're looking for.
Here's them explaining:

Turn the RPi on first then plug the miner in after it boots up and shows up on your network.

Try bitcoinstore, they have oodles of electronics including laptops. Maybe you'll find something similar to what you were looking for?
