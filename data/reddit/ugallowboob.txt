After 30 years all my ambition has been taxed out of me
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:33
That's just based on my income, luckily I have a lot of future assets.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:47:31
if I saved every penny I earned and had zero bills I could get 150k in like 10 years maybe.

Something, Something, ELY

Right, you hear the Thunder after you see the lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:18:01
He's going up now
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:33:40
Well yeah, I guess I mean what Napster did to help drive innovation in that industry.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:52:36
I disagree 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:34:43
Because I'm sure as hell not going to talk to the neighbors
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:12:56
You get a lot of people who start to do the same thing based on "economics".
When someone says something like "Bitcoin has support at 3400" that becomes semi-true as a self-fullfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:49:18
you could go half and half, 50% of what you want to spend before bed, risk the other half for in the morning
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:54:03
They condensed the original dbz to about the third of the size, removed filler, and even added scenes, also I believe the art is remastered.
It's probably the best way to rewatch the serious unless you seriously want to sit through the entire original.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:44:56
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:40:17
But, it's true
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:11:40
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:36:13
As much as I could afford
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:01:47
This is where I'm at.
I bought at 4277 and today is the first time I've really seen myself in the green. Hodling
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:01:50
Isn't legislation semi-moot really?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:31:27
Thanks! I just hope I'm not too late!
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:05:20
Be the dip
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:27:51
I'll be in the positive with my investment again lol
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:24:14
It was changed in Kai,
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:15:00
However, I think BTC will be the standard for a very long time..
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:25:28
Satoshi = Penny stock?
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:18:00
I think just the accuracy of a project to this scale hasn't really been done, especially with money.
There's no artificial wait times when syncing up and viewing the blockchain or making a transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:04:58
tomato potato
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:14:32
I just think it'll be seen as steady growth, like Bitcoin is adapting to the flow of the market just as much as people are adapting to use it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:23:34
What are the qualifications for becoming President again?
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:36:43
I bought at around 4277, I just wish I had been able to buy more than I did.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:11:49
This 
plus Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:51:06
No, I'm the one who posted triggered
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:37:43
Women don't exist on the internet.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:37:59
"Buy Bitcoin" ?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:45:25
It's treason then
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:20:39
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:47:08
So, what if you had 21 million wallets with 1 Bitcoin each.
Then you divided each of those wallets until we can't divide each of those coins again.
Will some sort of Bitcoin heat death occur?
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:47:38
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:25:59
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:48:50
Is it possible to have a bitcoin amount greater than 0 in every single one of those addresses?

Could I interest you in Paypal 3.0?
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:33:30
That's just what an alive person would say.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:59:30
kickboxing-coin may just be the coin for you!
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:59:56
Hey son, you got any of them crypto coins?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:37:02
To get onboard the Bitcoin express
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:58:30
I hope it chills at 3400 or less until I get paid and can hop back in.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:58:12
I think there's room for multiple, but I feel Bitcoin will always be a top contender.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:05:50
I think it's going to be a long bull jog.
Like a steady but obvious growth over a much longer time period. With little to no fall
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:58:47
Exposure, I had to search for it directly.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:40:25
Time to buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:14:27
In the end I imagine 2 or 3 total household names for crypto.
1. Bitcoin
2. (Second Best Crypto, whatever that ends up being)
3. Government-Based Crypto, like USACoin or something.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:55:01
I think Ripple will die out, but I agree on bitcoin and ethereum
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:35:48
Netflix would have to actually recommend it first.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:20:57
Nevermind it was this whole ELY conversation from a long time ago, it probably doesn't even make sense in the current environment anyways.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:45:03
I understand now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:49:17
I used their form
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:03:47
Do you have friends your age also into Bitcoin? How prevalent do you see your age group using crypto in 10 to 20 years?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:24:18
Where's that Half Life 3 bot at that dooms us even further?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:49:42
I attempted to buy 60$ worth of Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:48:40
Define "shady shit"
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:42:01
Yes, multiple times. I've tried contacting customer service multiple times as well.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:50:27
I have just 0.01
But it's worth over 50% more than what I paid for it

@_date: 2017-11-21 04:08:51
No, although I did misunderstand how their buy everyday feature worked
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:41:45
No email telling me why and no response from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:53:01
If Bitcoin gets to a million I'll pay off my student loans.
Really it's the only way it's gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:48:00
They disabled my buys and I cannot get any clarification or human to talk to me.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:47:40
Particularly in this case, my LTC order got canceled and I was buying an entire coin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:14:32
I think if America banned Bitcoin but other countries (like Japan) continue to embrace it, that it will continue to rise in value and Americans will lose opportunities to invest.
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:55:43
Like a relic in time
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:01:06
I'll sell someone .01 Bitcoin as soon as I can pay off all my debt with it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:30:54
BTC, duh
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:10:54
Most people will probably do what I did and say to themselves, "Oh Bitcoin is in the WSJ again? Time to hodl even harder"
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:20:34
Did it work?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:41:07
Why does it take so long for things to happen?
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:05:27
Thanks, I was really concerned about the extra 9.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:16:26
"If Bitcoin hits 1 million, I might actually buy some."  -Guy who will never buy Bitcoin, probably
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:35:30
I got into Bitcoin after spending many hours studying a deck of cards using some SQL tools.

Isn't BCash that fake Bitcoin?

Negative, I'm uGallowBoob
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:38:59
I have spent it, but I have some still as well
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:34:14
Then, just remind me in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:58:07
Like 3 or 4 days ago.
Know of a comparable service for USA?
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:39:25
I see $5000 as the floor now.
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:55:35
One day zimbabwecoin will be memed to value
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:28:16
Thought about it. Love it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:49:30
yay blockchain!
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:23:51
Imagine looking down at the floor and you see "$5000" on it, that's it.
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:57:00
Basically I wanted to be able to deal a game of texas hold-em with a SQL query, so I started by creating a database with the properties of the card, like what suit it is and what the face is. 
TLDR: Mathematically there's an invisible ACE in the deck that determines the winner every time, since basically the only thing that matters is the order of the deck.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:33:49
I buy Bitcoin because it's sound technology compared against a united states dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:00:17
Temporary pullback
