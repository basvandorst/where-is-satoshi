Link to videos?

Right. Selling your iPhone to someone who wants one also takes the sale of a new phone away from Apple.

I'm not sure about that. But you can restore from a backup and it should transfer over.

Are there any reports of approximately how many coins Gox is holding?
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:00:53
Right. Guess I forgot that people are still trading over there, even if they can't withdraw.

What exchange fees are you speaking of?

Why is it harder to audit the chain if the blocksize is increased?
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:05:53
Can anyone cite this?
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:56:14
Well, my math could be wrong too. One of us is wrong, anyway.

Their link discusses cryptocurrencies. Shouldn't we be happy that big banks are getting involved in some way?

Uh, how do people use bitcoin to hide assets? Don't people get paid in normal fiat? Are they just withdrawing cash to buy bitcoin in off-internet transactions?
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:40:23
Yes it does. This is an excerpt right from that page:

If a miner receives two transactions of the same bitcoin, which will it include in the next block - the one that got there first, or the one with a higher fee?
If a node receives two transactions with the same bitcoin, what happens there?

Huh? Do you mean one thousandth of a percent?
@_date: 2016-09-12 13:50:26
What does "HD" stand for in regards to wallets?
@_date: 2016-09-29 13:06:00
Yeah, what does a looming recession have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-29 13:20:09
No, I am asking why this was posted in Presumably, people think that if the USD crashes, then those who were holding BTC will rejoice.

Welcome, son.

I can spend dollars with cash, credit cards, checks, etc. etc. And besides cash, my USD transactions via credit are insured. I don't have any way to insure my BTC transactions.

It appears that you no longer can buy reddit gold with bitcoin:
Click 'Next' to see payment options; there is no mention of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:15:58

Biggest gen?

Why is everyone looking for your location?

Wait, really? How do you get your private keys using the coinbase multisig tool?
Edit, I see here: [
I wonder how long it would take to move BTC to the multisig vault and to get those private keys.
