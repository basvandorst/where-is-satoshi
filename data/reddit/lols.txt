For all you know your account still has the balance. Either you still have your dwollas in the account due to the transactions rolling back, or your BTC trade went through. It's too soon to tell. Mtgox will be opening soon (possibly).

Not sure why you're being downvoted. 100µg is a typical dose, so the article makes no sense.

I stopped reading right there.

Send all your coins to a new address that you own. Wipe drive. Reinstall OS. Send all coins to another new address. In that order.

Yes, but there's a daily limit. Considering that mtgox is planning a database rollback on trades, most of the BTCs will be accounted for, except for the number of BTCs that were withdrawn and gone forever. I do wonder how mtgox will compensate for this. If a hacker had a bunch of accounts set to buy at this price, with just enough funds for the daily limit buy on each account and immediately withdrew before the site went down, he's now very rich.

Seeing as the exchangers are making the most money and have the most to gain, they will be the loudest voices to be heard. I too find them annoying.

You should undervolt.

The withdraw daily limit from mtgox is something like 70 BTC, so you'd need to have multiple accounts. I'm sure there might be someone though.

Kicking myself because of exactly this.
