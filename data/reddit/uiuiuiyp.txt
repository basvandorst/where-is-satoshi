yeah i'm not an expert :( but to arbitrage repeatedly i would need to send money repeatedly to an account offshore to a say a partner, the korean IRS-equivalent would investigate me about money laundering..
I think 10k or 100k was the limit when they star looking in. so small scale arbitrage is okay? that's as far as I know

korean here..  household debt is actually around 90% of gdp. it's high but not that high. 
i have to say, korean people do like gambling.. so it is definitely a speculative bubble.. i sold mine when i saw that the price spread between US bitcoin value and korean bitcoin value began to diverge beyond 20%. I thought the market would correct itself but now it's gone off hinge. Seems like the speculative bubble has spread to other markets as well.
I tried to arbitrage the markets (me having bank accounts both in  korea and US) but it's kind of hard to do, with all the restrictions on both sides..

oh yeah i just read private debt as household debt. I hope you mean your warning in a good way, and not some your country sucks way.
yeah when i heard about household debts were huge (the absolute amount and not the ratio) I was quite a bit worried already. private debt of companies I wasn't so worried, maybe it's because I can't really relate to it nor do I know what is an appropriate level of debt level for companies. 
As a reference US household debt and private company debt levels are 90% and 100%, respectively. Now US is not the gold standard of debt level in the world but if debt levels were the only proxy for bubbles, US would be in the same level of trouble. 
Now I'm sure Keen gave a more nuanced view than this, so I'll go read that but please.. don't lecture people from other countries if you haven't lived there already. What would you say if I read a book on Brazil and told a Brazillian person that " dude your country is done".
