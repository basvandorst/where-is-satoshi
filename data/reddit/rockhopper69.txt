WoW! I had no idea ETC had that much leverage on the overall value of BTC. /s
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:47:34
It came from ETH. It's market cap is down $100M and falling... It's not Rocket Surgery! ;)

Can you prove it's not? I guess it's just a coincidence that the value of BTC started dropping at the start of the Dev/Miner "Happy Hour"... ;)
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:13:20
BTC is simply changing hands for ETC just like it does for drugs or any other commodity. Just because they buy the commodity ETC does that make the overall value of 1 BTC drop? I can see how the value of ETH would be affected as value is being transferred from ETH to ETC but I don't see the impact on the value of BTC just because someone buys a certain Alt coin with it.

I had the same issue a couple weeks back when the price dropped below $200. Tried several times and got the same response. They didn't ask for additional identity verification info just the same fuzzy BS excuse that they needed to perform additional verification of my account.
They claimed it would take about 10 days to complete!?!
I moved all my coins out and closed my account. Never go back to Circle again... ;(

A clear path to scaling. On-chain or off-chain doesn't really matter. As long as a solution becomes clearly defined.

If you keep your coins in the MultiSig Vault you can take it out anytime you like without their permission! Even if their site went down...

I had the same issue during the first week of Jan when the price dropped below $200. I played their game for a week and finally had them just close my account. After I emptied it of course... ;)

Same jargon you received. I will not be re-opening my Circle account though. I'm perfectly happy buying on CoinBase and moving the coin off to a paperwallet.
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:59:38
Not in 5 years! It might buy $0.20 worth of something.

1000/5000 was just a placeholder, maybe dump 100,000 on the public exchanges and then buy 500,000 on the OTC market at he new lower rates... who really knows what kind of manipulation occurs at the whale levels?
Hell, you're the Bitcoin_CFO, you tell me... Hehehe...

Consolidation. Push the prices down with a 1000 BTC dump then buy back 5000 at lower price.
