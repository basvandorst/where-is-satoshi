Did e-mail from "the boss" lure Crelan into fraud trap?
The bank Crelan has been the victim of serious fraud, the kind of which it warns against itself. The advice "never wire money based on an e-mail" was probably ignored at Crelan, writes "Het Nieuwsblad".

To achieve this, the fraudsters first try to map the structure of the company they want to defraud. Then they hack into e-mail and impersonate one of the big bosses.
In the e-mail, fraudsters posing as the CEO or another figure in power ask a financial worker to wire a certain amount. They say the payment must be done in the deepest confidence, for instance because the company is allegedly confronted suddenly with a tax audit, an unexpected deficit in one branch or another pretext.
The fraudsters ask to wire the money to a foreign account, after which is often vanishes.
Crelan would not confirm that they are the victim of this mechanism. According to CEO Luc Versele the justice department 'has asked not to communicate about the [details of the] fraud.
