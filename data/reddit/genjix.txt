go to austin, darkwallet has a good presence there.
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:24:59
We're under resourced, and have run out of funds. Now the team is remaining to code and bring the community the release volunteering full time.
Check this article:




Darkwallet has the opposite problem. We WANT politicised highly motivated individuals that think for themselves and are honest with us. We have lots of talent offering us their help from designers at the top of their field to highly skilled programmers. We just don't have the resources to pay people, and so everyone chips in a little of their time and things inch slowly along.
It's easy for me to sell the project, and take investor money. But I want to keep this project pure to its goals and integrity, and working for the community instead of selling it off to the highest bidders for their profit. I want Bitcoin users to profit from this project. We need to raise 40 BTC to make the release, and then we'll be in a strong position as a project to raise capital from multiple sources to fund development.
So don't be shy, we will deliver the best production ready wallet with unmatched technology on all fronts. Tools to create your own DAC, launder money to your own private super tax haven, a smooth beautiful experience and the best in instant yet private blockchain technology (that no other wallet has). 
Keep Darkwallet in your hands.

the logic is painful. opensource developers should contribute their time and effort to improve the product of a maliciously proprietary company so people can give them more money. it's like the people creating bitcoin wallets for apple iphones.

Eric, for DarkWallet we're also using a fork of bitcoinjs done by Vitalik together with our own JS lib for interfacing with Obelisk blockchain servers: 
Might be good if we can merge both the libraries. I would like to see a definitive bitcoinjs fork to carry the torch and pool contributor efforts rather than all this fragmentation.

This is a bad idea. You should only use a tx radar (the technical name for this) for sending BTC, not for confidence about receiving BTC.
You can wait for a tx to get 100% propagation then have it replaced by sending a higher fee tx to replace it. You don't even have to tell the network. You can simply send it to a few specific miners that will overwrite the tx for you.

This is trash and degrading to women. People have endless discussions about girls in Bitcoin and then talk like this.
And why? Because it's about promoting girls who find their value through their sexuality + beauty, rather than what they objectively do as people.
Most who don't understand are kissless virgins who will go through their life trying to buy the affection of women. Sex is good, love is great... but this attitude of trying to push bitcoin through sexy women with no brains vs pushing the smart women in our community is trash.
For all the Bitcoiners who seek legitimacy/image and complain about me pushing drugs, where are the people saying this is wrong. This is one of the highest voted stories on the front page. What did these girls do to get that attention of all the Bitcoiners? And what about Elizabeth who works tirelessly on Bitcoin.
We have smart capable women in our community, so why are we promoting these dumb whores? Who the fuck are they? Plastic girls with big tits? Wow you're so cool. It reminds me of when the BF choose that young plastic pretty spokesgirl to represent them on TV who knew nothing about bitcoin. And those BitPay adverts who use the girl in pretty red lipstick to push their product. Why not promote a world based on love with relationships established based on mutual understanding, rather than promoting a world where men make money to fuck good looking young bitches. 90% of you will never be in that bracket either.

You can't choose choice and anti-choice. It's like supporting Iran and Iceland because you like freedom. Allaire does not support freedom.
Long term things like coin validation, legal pressure on miners and software developers, development of censorship/surveillance software, groups controlling wallet development and collusion between different industry groups... all this stuff affects the technology you use. It you support the long term vision of what's possible with Bitcoin, then you should oppose things that will use regulatory capture to morph bitcoin into another gov or corp coin.
Bitcoin is not a payments system. It is something far deeper than that. I would sacrifice this for nothing. There are massive implications here for how society is organised. Don't sacrifice long term profit for short term gain.

FYI I don't think Peter is arguing against ever loosening Bitcoin's constraints like the block-size, but there's a lot of issues here that cannot be glossed over and if taken lightly threaten the critical integrity of Bitcoin. Sadly, Gavin is in the pocket of Bitcoin corporations for whom the fundamental utility of Bitcoin is as a payments mechanism, not an alternative store of value, and so they're pushing for cheaper transactions. The choice is between a decentralised uncensored private Bitcoin, and a centralised cheap efficient Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-19 23:44:10
Well miners will be able to use blocks to punish smaller miners. It's also a bit more complicated since there are quite a few vectors of attack I failed to mention for the sake of brevity. Maybe can also chime in.
What you said is also accurate. It's also about who controls the developers, miners, hardware manufacturers, who runs the infrastructure, ... It's also not only about the core consensus changing, but about features that are adopted and pushed on users or embedded in the infrastructure. Bitcoin has a strong network effect, as more people adopt one particular aspect it becomes heavily entrenched. Financial infrastructure development &amp; adoption is not the same as downloading the latest kewl app for your mobile phone. Everything affects everything else as Bitcoin is a p2p network technology formed around a fundamental consensus. For better or for worse, we are in the same boat.
And the danger is not from malicious states or actors, the danger is from ourselves. Proactively censorship by corporations because of perceived threats or working in collusion with certain parties to curry special favour in contradistinction to the values of a free unhindered and open Bitcoin. Things like surveillance affects everybody in the network and degrades all our total privacy. The more widespread, the stronger it becomes.
In the end it will be the Bitcoin corporations who see Bitcoin as a payments innovation that will push for things like the removal of the block size limit, or removing the ability to double spend unconfirmed transactions- which oops btw [enables miners to blacklist transactions]( But not everyone sees the same adversaries I do. When Mike talks about privacy, he means privacy from your family, your neighbours whereas when I talk about anonymity, I mean from state level attackers, which is undesirable for him since it hinders law enforcement efforts, see section on [policing hidden services]( Fact is all these groups who are decidely anti-freedom and anti-free market are in collusion with one another, that's why Gelenbe, Allaire, Gavin and Mike are at the top of the Bitcoin2014 speaker list while the real contributors to Bitcoin like ThomasV (Electrum), Peter Todd, Alan Reiner, Nicolas, Stefan Thomas, Johann Gevers, Meni Rosenfeld, Jan Moller (Mycelium), Erik Vorhees, Nejc Kodric, Gavin Wood and others appear somewhere down the bottom after all the smiling shirts and ties. We push down our real friends in favour of some shortsighted sociopaths who want to neuter the currency for short term profit, for themselves, at the expense of long term gain for everyone.
But hey look the Winklevii have made another declaration!
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:45:04
No. The technology itself is threatened by political forces and who controls the infrastructure. I only wish these things had no affect and we could be indifferent to their existence. But this is not the case. Nothing is an island in this world, and this kind of comment betrays a very simple understanding of how technology works and functions.
Have you been following the FCC stuff, and the way telcos are dominating the internet through regulations and powers? Bitcoin is big stakes. People are looking only 1 step ahead and losing sight of what's possible. I don't believe in sacrificing long term profit for short term gains.
If it was a perfect free market, then I would be happy. But these are real companies in real jurisdictions such as the people who create Bitcoin hardware or maintain mining centres, or develop software. Learn from history.

G8 magazine, June 2013 "Protecting digital economies":
"If the leaders of the European Union and United States could be convinced to take a lead on these initiatives [banning Bitcoin], that would be a huge contribution to making the internet a safe place for financial transactions. At the same time, it would also strike a blow against those who would try to destroy the fabric of our world’s well-being."
JP Morgan, Feb 2014 "The audacity of Bitcoin":
"But followers of financial history know the limitation of a system based on a fixed or slow-growing money supply: **it imposes uncomfortable financial discipline on governments, households and corporates.** [i.e governments, consumers, the corporations" (goes on to talk about how printing dollars was used to fund WW1 and the Vietnam war as a good thing)
ECB, Oct 2012 "Virtual currency schemes":
"Authorities need to consider whether they intend to formalise or acknowledge and regulate these schemes. In this regard, a likely suggestion could sooner or later involve virtual currency scheme owners registering as financial institutions with their local regulating authorities. This is a similar trajectory to the one PayPal has undergone, as it was granted a banking licence in Luxembourg in 2007 after its service became popular. This is not an easy step, but it looks like the only possible way to strike a proper balance between money and payment innovations on the one hand, and consumer protection and financial stability, on the other."
Mark my words. The problem is not with this regulation needing to be fixed. They will probably tone down the proposal and it will be hailed as a victory within the community, yet be another step toward normalisation of their activities.
Stand strong and unyielding. We don't need their legitimisation.

Just like with the internet where we ceded control and things got magically better because more people are using it? Snowden has not taught you anything. Every person using an apple product, using google, or with facebook is helping resources flow to those products to further capture the market and lobby the government for special favour (copyrights, patents .etc) like the telcos are doing to monopolise internet and push out competitors. Regulation and control is a stinking thing that threatens to pollute the very core technical promise of Bitcoin, and oppose freedom. The code and math is not magical and untouchable. They evolve in directions and one is locking in the market, and the other is opening it up, one is muscling in with dirty tactics (law, politics, wall st buddies) and propaganda, and the other is the free market. Technology is not just innovation, it's also a socio-political dynamics, and Bitcoin is fundamentally a consensus of whoever has control of the network infrastructure. Bitcoin is not completely decentralised and will only get worse; these companies are going to push to get rid of the block limit, and only miners would oppose them, the net effect being centralisation of miners. It's lunacy to think they want push for these policies since it would lower transaction fees, and also use law or corporate cabals to muscle these policies on users trapped in walled gardens. Think of the real threats here.

Despite all-pervasive CCTV, we are not at the stage yet where the surveillance apparatus is able to pick up minor common criminals. Mostly people get arrested when they fuck up hard and are checked in the station against a database.

it's unbelievable that developers are throwing everything and the kitchen sink into the protocol. I'd never heard of this change, which shows how fast people are pushing for poorly thought decisions that impact the entire future of Bitcoin. It's like people have got bored with the crappy bitcoind codebase and are looking to add all their favourite new features to the protocol. Very very bad decision making is shown on that github thread.
Innovation should happen on the IMPLEMENTATION level *not* the protocol which should stay pure, focused and simple. The thread conversation shows a totally disregard in attitude for integrity and security of the Bitcoin system. Have developers lost their mind?
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:17:36
and yet satoshi did have principles, and like an artist with different shades of paint, he chose to very clearly make a bitcoin which functions in a certain way with a limited supply and free from censorship and blacklists.
what you saying doesn't even make sense and is garbage. everything is political from whether you choose to forget your responsibility and give money (i.e support to corporations), to trying to become self employed. the bitcoin protocol functions precisely because it is uncensored and a decentralised p2p network. anything opposing that directly threatens the integrity of this technology. most of the actors or parties who oppose that have decidely anti-libertarian philosophy and ideals.
and don't somehow assume bitcoin is immune as I've heard others here tout that it's code and math. Bitcoin is incredibly fragile and subject to the whims and fancy of whoever controls the system. whoever is at the top at that moment in time, has the ability to direct the flow of tech development in the direction they choose.
gavin's talk about the poor and pushing for removing the blocksize limit is something that will centralise mining (something already very dangerously centralised in hands of a few large ops + major asic manufacturers). of course he is going to push that because he works for the corporations who see bitcoin as a payments innovation for buying coffee at the bar, not for the real features of bitcoin which undermine established order.

The US has more to lose by banning Bitcoin than Bitcoin does. The world is bigger than the US. The US wants to be a leader and maintain control they have. The government is not going lose their grip and support from corporations. They will however make attempts to undermine it from within. Bitcoin would thrive in an underground economy which is the vast majority of the world economy (places on earth outside the USA).

it's oriented around large inflexible frameworks and design patterns. everything in java is about writing standardised code that relies on over-engineering problems rather than thinking about or properly understanding them. it's like the author who writes by taught formula rather than learned creativity. the heavy corporate influence shows within java culture. many of the accepted norms like nested namespaces or how code is modularised would be considered bad form in other programming language cultures like c++ or python (but all cultures are different). if you want a more specific critique: 
there are lots of cool languages about expressiveness, asychronicity (erlang) or solid code (python). it's also about my style since i favour toolkit libraries (classes, functions and utilities) over frameworks (complete programs with stubs for you to fill in - a place to hang your hat).
ofc you can do this or that in java, but at the end of the day, there's a way you write good java code that's different from how you write good c++ code because of the language cultures. and i don't how 'good java code' is optimised is not something i favour. there's a reason so many corporations use java. it's not because it empowers programmers.

And yet as a Bitcoin developer living in London for 2 years, I received no assistance from any of these big money types and now we are developing DarkWallet in Barcelona. This is all talk and hot air. London is full of VCs looking for the next money-churning scheme, with no interest in furthering real Bitcoin tech. This attitude is not going to produce any substantial results with all the placation before regulators and the old finance types who tried to censor my actions and push me out. Either that or made attempts to own and control my work. Some of these people purport to be libertarians in private, but don't realise that through their action they are furthering very anti-libertarian action. Bitcoin is the future, and there are real threats to the integrity of this system that risk compromising our shared consensus &amp; infrastructure. This threats come from within, and through our own action. Disobedience is the only way to ensure the integrity of Bitcoin, and anything else is tantamount to lack of belief in the strength of cryptocurrency (which goes way way beyond money and definitely cannot be stopped).

Time people organise and focus on the human values.
As the Wikipedia on anarchism says: As a subtle and **anti-dogmatic** philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.

As a Dark Wallet developer, I want to say that the OPs scenario is not likely to happen.
The real risks to Bitcoin are far more subtle. Mining is already approaching dangerously centralised levels - and I don't mean who controls the hashing power. As manufacturing becomes more specialised very few people are going to be providing the parts globally and are going to come under pressure from certain actors. Also these single points of failure will have undue influence on how Bitcoin evolves.
Gavin proposes to remove the tx fee because Bitcoin will price out the poor. Nice way of presenting a proposal to remove the blocksize limit which although it would lower tx fees allowing Bitcoin "the payment system" at the expense of Bitcoin the decentralised network, by centralising more power with miners.
This is the problem with Bitcoin. Our infrastructure being in the power of groups [who see Bitcoin as a payments innovation]( not as a [revolutionary new form of currency]( and everything that entails (new technology for creating [new forms of human organisation](
Bitcoin is not unmovable code and math. Bitcoin is the consensus of whoever holds the power. Not everyone is competing on an equal level in a free market. Some people are grovelling to Washington, helping them draft new laws so they can get exclusive or first access to 'legitimised' markets and taking stolen money from their friends in Wall Street. Meanwhile people are jumping for the $10 without realising they are the product, and are helping further the development of blacklisting and surveillance technologies (wonder why Circle [has hired Mike Hearn](
I hope Bitcoin's price crashes but maintains its integrity as a free market currency. The mainstream brought nothing to the internet except censorship and control from states. Big money is overhyped, Bitcoin offers grander bigger visions for humans and people want to throw that away for what? So many possibilities but but...
The fact is I've been attacked and shunned by the foundation and all their cronies throughout the last 3 years. They say one thing in public and [do another thing in private]( This is the banality of fascism, where your claim to the throne is the image you must maintain (of being official) and everything that comes with maintaining that position (squashing of merit, censorship of opposition, control) while everyone clambers to be part of the hierarchy. The level of stupidity around Bitcoin makes me think I'm pissing into the wind, when Bitcoin is misunderstood so fundamentally by so many people. It is a fragile experiment subject to all the political powers at play inside it. You are part of that by who you give your consent, resources and support to.
The alternative is free open markets of competition and collaboration where ideas thrive on merit. Values of openness, diversity, empowerment of your neighbour .etc
Don't give an inch to anyone claiming official authority. They are always charlatans.

He's fraternising with a body of people who see Bitcoin primarily as a payments mechanism. They pay him a salary, and hire him. He pushes Bitcoin through his work more towards that direction, such as developing the payments protocol.
That's how the world works. Nobody is independent. It's about who you're representing, and what values you stand for. Gavin doesn't stand for decentralisation, privacy or anti-censorship. That's simply not his main aims because of who he works with/for. They have different aims which sometimes can conflict with ours such as pushing for regulation or the ability for authorities to have increased oversight over Bitcoin. Their main aims are a Bitcoin which has low fees and quick transfers, which Bitcoin just isn't really built for.

are you going to work with legislators to draft up bitcoin friendly legislation? are you going to help them find info on how they can apply existing laws to bitcoin? how they can monitor the tech for legitimate law enforcement purposes? food in the door kind of thing... small baby steps in dangerous territory. people are really missing the big picture &amp; true dangers to bitcoin's network/coin neutrality when they talk about pre-emptive protective measures (i.e self censorship).

"The informal sector or informal economy is that part of an economy that is not taxed, monitored by any form of government or included in any gross national product (GNP), unlike the formal economy."
"For example, informal employment makes up 48% of non-agricultural employment in North Africa, 51% in Latin America, 65% in Asia, and 72% in sub-Saharan Africa. If agricultural employment is included, the percentages rise, in some countries like India and many sub-Saharan African countries beyond 90%. Estimates for developed countries are around 15%."

The foundation pays his salary, and the foundation is funded by Bitcoin corporations. Their interest in Bitcoin is as a payments mechanism between consumers and corporations (i.e BitPay, Coinbase, ...). That's who Gavin represents as a developer- the body of people who want to use Bitcoin for online shopping. You can see that with him developing the payments protocol. They pay his salary, and they are buddies together.

No. The technology they deploy affects us all. The laws and influence they push for affect our industry. The changes and infrastructure they are a party to are weaponised against users.

One concern of mine is bloating the core Bitcoin codebase that it takes to write a functioning Bitcoin node. This shuts out developers from re-implementing the system (decreasing diversity of implementations as leverage against control by a central party), and decreases oversight by the public nullifying one of the strengths of Bitcoin being opensource. An example is protocol support for bloom filters which decreases scalability in Bitcoin, adds a new attack vector and doesn't add real privacy. In fact in my most extreme vision of the Bitcoin protocol, it should be a simple PUBSUB network for propagating new unconfirmed transactions and confirmed blocks. This prevents against a whole class DoS problems related to adding state (which bloom filters increases). Another example are adding blockchain rules or extending the scripting language which I'm extremely suspicious about, and which has already happened a few times and will probably happen again more in the future. There are many forum proposals circulating among developers for ways to extend and even improve Bitcoin. And some of these will get implemented. And who is overseeing the oversee-ers? It's the community. But if there's no community around Bitcoin development because it's siloed and an ecosystem surrounded by proprietary "offerings" then Bitcoin will slide into something controlled by shysters.

To understand why this is important see this:
The applications go beyond mere Twitter replacement to things like seller pages, blogs and encrypted web. Forget what PirateBay and Mega are doing - this is here now and working, the coder is a good one and it's been in dev since 6 months already. We can even negotiate payments or coordinate multisig, meaning that things like the payment protocol are now obsolete through this tech. It's massive.
Imagine sending anonymous payments to usernames. (in a profile you attached a piece of dht data = mpk chain code, generate new mpk = hash(user mpk + secret) to generate receive addrs, send btc to addr, deliver secret to receiving user so they can recover btc, wait for their reply back ack payment).
Example ideas:
* Store an updateable webpage on Twister. Post the webpage source, and then for every change a diff. Software can parse the posts and apply the diffs to get the current webpage.  Seller updates page anonymous
* Share a key between multiple people for private messaging groups. 
* Software uses posts to automatically negotiate multisig actions or request an MPK for generating receive addresses for an identity. 
* Register your wallet key as an password encrypted backup using single. Then later you can recover your wallet using your username and password.

a great philosophy, basically lets make the ecosystem less inducive for freedom and make the jobs of opensource devs a million times harder. technologies do not exist in their own isolated bubbles. an interlinked web is more accurate.
the tech people use in iphones becomes standard simply because people are using it, and regardless of whether i think its good for freedom or not, it becomes integral to the tech. the ecosystem builds off what exists and is used, once it grows it solidifies in the ecosystem regardless of merit. there's other factors like big corps taking wall st money and using govt regulations to one up real market competition.

the state:
* centralises power in banks to have them as agents of the state to collect taxes: 
* Paper money contributes massively to state power, not only by profits from inflation, but by giving leverage over who can accumulate wealth. system is rigged against us.
* wages wars, funds militias, overthrows governments. biggest conflict since WW2 is iran-iraq where iraq launched a war of aggression killing and gassing millions encouraged by the west. Al Qaeda was funded by pakistani proxies to fight soviets, and actually worked against real afghan revolutionaries (see shah massoud). US/UK overthrow democratic iran leader to put in a dictator because prime minister wanted to nationalise oil, see operation ajax.
* govt complains it cannot provide housing for poor, yet constructing houses can be incredibly low cost, effective and cheap. however regulations make just living super expensive because of compliance. no freedom to explore or do your own thing. you need to build according to "approved" templates.
* capitalism for the rich, socialism for the poor.
* censorship, surveillance, patents, copyrights
* visas, borders and restrictions which are more a political/diplomatic tool rather than the common misbelief of them being for safety.
* protectionism and serving corporate interests.
* corruption and outright lies. Start listening to what your politicians are saying, follow them and compare it with the facts. For instance Tony Blair knowingly lied and fabricated evidence about Iraq to initiate the war. do you really want these people ruling us?
* governments are gentlemen's clubs where one politicians's cousin is the CEO of some bank and his best friend is the head of monsanto.

I spend a lot of time around street people, homeless and poor. A lot of bitcoin people are honestly clueless bordering on arrogance sometimes. Go to Africa with your tablets as a white man and an outsider with your techno-utopic visions of how they should live... this is too common mindset. Yuppie consumers with iphones living in manhattan apartments drinking coffee at starbucks planning their startup &amp; talking about what's good for the world. I think everyone should spend time in a bit of hardship and gain some humility and humbleness first.
the real use for bitcoin is self-organising without the state using decentralised markets, securities, anonymous sound money, blockchain governance ... stuff you can't do with the $. bitcoin is NOT a payments system, the blockchain is just not suitable. bitcoin is a store of value or a transaction/contract system. the fees for payments will just be too high once the block reward disappears unless we're willing to centralise bitcoin into another controlled banking system.

Sorry about the rewards, many people signed up to the backerkit late and we were busy. All of us are preoccupied but I've seen first screenshots of the t shirts so I'm confident they'll be done.
We are a mid size team. Our current funds between ~6 of us sits at 15k EUR, and probably need another 15k to last this year.
Our funds are: 31oSGBBNrpCiENH3XMZpiP6GTC4tad4bMy and 32wRDBezxnazSBxMrMqLWqD1ajwEqnDnMc + we only ended up with 10k CAD$ (~7k EUR) in the end from the hackathon: 3MfDU85JSCd8Py8KtdUwgbdVFQzwSN6fjQ
Funds are basically allowing us to expand operations since if we think smart + keep our spending low then we can last forever as money goes far with us (we reinvest, put in long term projects .etc).
Also we're still on alpha and things break easily.

People are delusional if they think governments have no power over Bitcoin. Bitcoin is subjects to the wills and forces acting on it, and it's very possible for Bitcoin to evolve into something very much not in line with Satoshi's principles because of many small choices from corrupted organisations or groups who have influential power over Bitcoin.
Bitcoin being opensource does not guard solely against corruption. People have to actually be actively participating in development as a community. If Bitcoin is developed by coders working for large corporations, what kind of choices do you think they'll take on those day to day decisions? They will take the development decisions that benefit corporations. And there are many deep and hard decisions that only few contemplate coming up in Bitcoin's future.
The payments protocol is the finest example as something that has a high initial setup cost, only benefitting established merchants (such as BitPay) but not the small guy with a crappy webshop on a blog, individuals doing p2p transfers or the darknet markets. Bitcoin grows in the direction where we invest our energies. The core consensus is subject to the forces of the different actors pulling on it. It has and does change.

Twister has nice privacy concepts, but it's not pure anonymity yet. However I believe these things can only improve with time. i.e algorithms for routing between swarms deterministically and such.
Currently you can publish from a different swarm and it will migrate to the target swarm masking your IP address somewhat. Also you can participate in a swarm as though you were a neighbouring node (although I'm not sure if that helps too much).

I read that document, and feel shame that all that intelligence has been hijacked for producing crap. It's "professionally presented", and probably a lot of money went into that, so it's a pity to think those minds are producing this propaganda and not working with us on worthwhile things for the people.
Also we are stupid if we believe that compromising on Bitcoin's integrity to win favour will work. All we do is lose our position of power as a sovereign economy + emerging technology. Bitcoin serves the people &amp; not these guys. You can't play nice with a bully who sees kindness as weakness. These corporations are psychopaths and you can bet power-hungry players ally with other powerful interests, not those dinky Bitcoin geeks who threaten the status quo &amp; establishment.

The vast majority of the world economy does not give a fuck about the government.
"The informal sector or informal economy is that part of an economy that is not taxed, monitored by any form of government or included in any gross national product (GNP), unlike the formal economy."
"For example, informal employment makes up 48% of non-agricultural employment in North Africa, 51% in Latin America, 65% in Asia, and 72% in sub-Saharan Africa. If agricultural employment is included, the percentages rise, in some countries like India and many sub-Saharan African countries beyond 90%. Estimates for developed countries are around 15%."

Well that's no reason we need to buy our legitimacy by comprimising on Bitcoin's fundamentals. I believe Bitcoin is strong enough that it will resist any attempts to stop it, and that over time, the need is too strong that it will overcome any resistance (like happened with the printing press in a much more repressive time when it threatened a much stronger order). Most of the world does not live in the US-consumerist micro-world. Most of the world is the black market, and Bitcoin stands to benefit them the most. Heck, even China probably supports Bitcoin tacitly as a way to undermine the dollar. There's a reason RT is so strongly advocating Bitcoin since the early days of 2011.

What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. The early attempts at shutting down centralised file sharing services ended up spawning stronger technology. Like a hydra, those of us in the community that push for individual empowerment are in an arms race to equip the people with the tools needed for the next generation of digital black markets.
We will take a tour of various technological components; some old, some new that we can use to piece together the next generation of resilient uncensored markets. We will also wander into bigger questions about the role of technology, and efforts under way to carve out spaces of the future where we can survive, and thrive as freedom loving people.
Technology is power, and a new front has opened in the struggle for freedom. These tools are for resource management, digital governance and new finance. Technology is not, and never will be neutral. Software is art.

Ethereum is a great project that is forging new ground. It is one of the most exciting projects in the Bitcoin space. If you want to slander every new visionary as a scam then you are shutting yourself in screaming that there is only one way to do things and it is the Bitcoin way.
Ethereum is about digital cryptolaw not cryptocurrency. It is the first of its kind taking this new data structure of the blockchain and seeing how it can be applied to other problem domains. They have taken a clever first step of making everything as general as possible to provide a solid base for developers to come innovate on top. They are long term thinkers.
Also Ethereum may not be the final step but they are first movers. There might be bigger coming innovations but I know Vitalik is already thinking about stuff like provable computation.

Yes, I agree with you. Whether or not I agree with mtgox, there was a lot of people jumping the bandwagon to bash mtgox &amp; kick them while they're down. I resisted to comment on then because I don't think it's appropriate to cause more hate about an already failing business facing strong anger from the community.

you talk a lot about bitcoin as a payments system but bitcoin is a crappy payments system. bitcoin transactions are subsidised around $30 each atm. if we wanted bitcoin to be good at payments, we end up centralising it (that's the only efficient way to do it) otherwise everybody storing a copy of ALL the transactions on thousands of computers globally is redundant and expensive.
bitcoin's value is as a store or way to settle debts, not for transmission of small amounts of money. it's just not the right technology. bitcoin's advantage is decentralised, uncensored, global and anonymous.

These companies smack of people with a solution in search of a problem rather than searching for a problem to fit a solution. The use cases are absurd and there's no reason to use Bitcoin. With all the amazing possibilities of Bitcoin, people still aren't able to look further than what already exists. Every so often you hear about these companies getting millions but since the last few years none of them has done shit. The wallets people are using and the software running the infrastructure is built by a community of independent developers still. I have yet to see otherwise. There's a lot of fanfare from these respectable shiny startup companies seeking big money, and the community seems obsessed by them but the real work is coming from the garage developers. Bitcoin is a micro revolution but people are excited by the world's (not-)first regulated exchange and another Winklevii proclamation? Tell me what have the Winklevoss twins done in all their time except make big sounding statements about big money. All of this "Bitcoin news" is an absolute joke ignoring the real hardcore developments happening in Bitcoin that will shake our world and are passing by everyones noses.

On the black market, the gap already stands at 60%. Nobody can predict the breaking point that would prompt Ahmadinejad to act desperately; the point where the ayatollahs feel threatened enough to resort to a military provocation that would bully the world and exact such high price as to prompt the international community to lift the chokehold.

Transfering USD to our site we do have cheaper solutions. Deposits from Dwolla are 25cents. Domestic ACH transfers are free.
As for BitInstant. We have not integrated with BitInstant. We have a track-record of security not just because we are built, owned and run by code bitcoin developers. But we are also secure because we do not take any risks. I am seeing a growing co-dependence in bitcoin exchangers which scares me as I can see it leading to a potential domino effect if another problem were to take place. Problems such as (mybitcoin.com, bitomat, mtgox hack, Bitcoin7, Tradehill shut down, BTC-E compromisation and others) have certainly had their impact. Sometimes eco systems are only as strong as their weakest link. I am proud to say we do not participate in anyway in what I consider to be this co dependence.
We do not accept vouchers of payment from other Bitcoin exchanges. We only rely on ourselves and funds are not dependent on the promissory notes of other exchanges.
As for BitInstant, we are waiting for them register as a money service business with fincen as well as register as a money transmitter in each state in which they operate. We have notified them of this and I heard from my partner today that they are takings steps to rectify the matter. They seem like nice people and I believe they have every intention to operate honestly. Once they register, we will be happy to use them as well as a gateway. Failing that however, we cannot justifiably pass on what we consider highly risky to our users. 
Bitcoinica is quite different then Intersango. It is more of a forex speculation platform where "Trades on Bitcoinica don’t measure the same as trades on Bitcoin exchanges as trades on Bitcoinica don’t cause bitcoins to actually trade hands."
I have quoted from the following article:
I suggest you read it in full to get an understanding of the differentiation.
Finally, I would like to state that everything in this post is our opinion and should be independently verified. We are not lawyers and are not making legal claims. Our use of words such as but not limited to "negligent, illegal" are our opinions and should be taken as such. People should do their own research and develop their own conclusions. There is a lot of public information out there but it's impossible to sift through the whole of the internet without knowing what to look for in the first place. Many of my friends even mistook the mtgox hack for a security flaw in bitcoin :/

It was. We received an offer to integrate a $100m company and their multimillion userbase (mobile service provider) with bitcoin however I realized what they were asking for was impossible with the current bitcoin client. While Satoshi was a genius he is not a professional programmer. I left the Satoshi client a few months ago and started another.
There are a few clients out there but they are all based off the origional Satoshi client. About 8 months ago I started building full time from scratch a modular bitcoin client. It is now working. An entire bitcoin client. 
This is the first reimplementation of the bitcoin protocol and with a much more modular design. There are many cool things about the client and if you are a programmer I suggest you read the bitcointalk thread.
One cool feature libbitcoin created was offline transactions. The biggest impediment to mass adoption of bitcoin is simply that the average person will never be a professional at securing their data. Offline devices will be able to produce a transaction which can be transfered to the most virus riddled computer without risk of exposure one's private key. We have already written the software.

Actually, he does seem to have it all wrong. We have never had a security breach and all our errors have been as a result of human error. While we try to automate as much as possible there are certain aspects of running an exchange that are impossible to automate. 
There was a case where we misappropriated 511 BTC. Not only did we cover the cost ourselves but managing our online wallet every day, or almost everyday allowed us to easily cover the costs. We at the time were also a free service. Banks make mistakes like this every day. It is unfortunate that it happened yes but we are proud of both of diligence in depleting the online wallet often enough and having the security back up.
As for the recent incident, again it was not a hack and it was due to human error. Although I do believe we should take more steps despite our bulk emailing code not being a threat to the security of the site.
One thing that should be mentioned is that the privacy incident did not jeopardize the security of the site because of the parameters and security features we have in place. I am not sure of the specific number but it is 3 sign in attempts per minute or 10 per 10 minutes. Even a relatively simple password could not practically be undone by a dictionary attack.
Needless to say, our back up security is not excuse for our lapse in privacy but we are not liars. It's a bit demoralizing too that such an event can be turned into the post i read above. It was a human error which we paid for out of pocket while running a free site for almost a year. I don't think most of our competition would be so generous

- Electricity becomes cheaper
- More people mine
- Mining becomes harder

About net-neutrality: yes that is nice. But even more pressing is that the regulations on communications cause a lot more stillborn growth than anything else. Take a look at Somalia's booming telecommunications sector. I can agree with get government out of the internet. And to be honest, I'm less afraid of censorship by telecoms (that want my money) than by governments working on behalf of media conglomerates. Yes, they will engage in throttling but it seems the way around that is deregulation to get around monopolies - I doubt that the telecoms industry is a type of industry which benefits from economies of scale in the same way Walmart or a McDonalds do.

These things are a form of cold reading. People swear by them, but I've spoken with an economist from the London School of Economics and a professional High Frequency Trader in London who both told me independently that this is meaningless.
Maybe it does have some effect though by influencing the market and providing some pressure. But that does not make it a predictor or anything. "Markets are just noise" (quote from Max Keiser), and you cannot simply draw lines on them and extrapolate them out.

I wrote this there replying to someone, but it's also relevant here:
You make a good point, and I can totally understand what you're saying. But ethics is more than 'being good'. Ethics is about helping good people make good decisions when the best decision isn't always clear.
There are hundreds of small ethical decisions everyday that build up to outcomes. Catherine wasn't talking about bitcoin's anthropomorphic morality, but about the people driving bitcoin forwards. The community.
There are many small decisions now about bitcoin's future that can have massive future ramifications if bitcoin becomes big. Computing, the internet and web itself are an empowering tool simply because of those early engineers who had the prescience to design it that way, understanding the future impact such tools would have.
Their ethical decisions are a gift to us today. And a valuable and humbling example to follow.

Don't confuse the two terms. Technical analysis (evidence-based - EBTA) is an established field with some science behind it. This is like financial astrology and without any factual foundation. Promoters of New Age philosophy proclaim empty promises about health cures. These claims lack any kind of specificity and makes it impossible to know what exactly it claims to do, and so devise a test for it. You can never confirm or contradict these claims with objective evidence. Likewise the claims by subjective technical analysis are empty and insulated from empirical challenge. You accept them on faith alone. Perhaps Gann angles provide some info, but as they exist right now, they are untested and not subject to the scientific method.
Some handy links:
"Gann market forecasting methods are based on geometry, astronomy and astrology, and ancient mathematics."

That's true, however I think you're conflating true utility with moral utility. People don't always maximise utility rationally. A bad mathematical decision is a bad decision when speaking about investment decisions. Rationalising bad decisions by reasoning about utility to back up losing bets makes you a gambler in my book, and not an investor.
The example you give doesn't really conflict what I said either. It is simply a more accurate equity calculation taking into account outside factors. Of course, I'm assuming that OP is sufficiently bankrolled otherwise he again would be a gambler, and taking on risk he shouldn't be taking.

A discussion the community needs to be having.
@_date: 2012-05-22 18:26:21
I am working my guts off for no profit, and we are all making below market rates. The competition for the tiny profitable segment of Bitcoin is intense but it's doable if you're dedicated and know how to value your time (discarding dead-end projects and focusing on value). Currently I divide my time into research, studying and work.
Research is learning the internals and keeping up with the trends in the Bitcoin world. This isn't too important, and I think many people in the community overdo this aspect by getting too involved in forum discussions and mailing lists which can suck up your time.
Studying is what every good developer should always be doing. In Bitcoin's case, it means studying algorithms and technology that is directly applicable to areas of Bitcoin that you're interested in. In my case it is concurrency, architecture/design, databases and mathematics.
Work is writing articles, planning and conceptualising ideas, implementing projects, resolving issues and all the lifecycle parts to take a project to completion. I think every person is different but what works for me is to work on a single task at a time, but switch between them periodically to refresh my focus and exercise the mind (rather than being stuck in rigidity). In that way you can be absorbed in multiple projects at once.
What works for us, is that our projects all tie in together. They have a deliberate function, and relations between everyone is good. For you, I don't think that working on a single interesting project (like MultiBit) can work if you want to earn from Bitcoin - it needs to be tied into another project somehow. Just like Google offering Google Translate doesn't work by itself but forms a coherent whole that has qualitative value for the rest of Google.
If you want profit, then focus on profit - there are lots of projects to support yourself that way but it requires more dedication. Don't expect the same rate as a day job though as they are paying a premium for on-site work. I started this way in the beginning (made a bunch of Bitcoin sites and did a bit of paid work) but it was for peanuts and not the most effective nor interesting use of my skills...
Anyway I hope what I wrote helps :)

I am the BIP editor :) My biggest aim is to make bitcoin an open, democratic and fair system.
The balance against me rejecting too many BIPs is that developers start ignoring the BIP process or form a new one. In actual practice I decide very little on BIPs, only accepting them or rejecting them based on whether they fit the style.
For instance, Gavin was not happy that I accepted a competing BIP 17 to his BIP 16. But it met the criteria, and I saw it as good proposal that is technically sound. If anything the BIP process decreases the power of the Satoshi client on bitcoin.org and gives a voice to the developers of other clients by formalising the standardisation process.
It's why I started the whole thing to begin with. That you don't see it on bitcoin.org... well my name used to be on bitcoin.org but those developers tried to shut me out of development and use it to promote their brand of bitcoin client. Really I think it should be a neutral place promoting all alternative bitcoin clients and provide access to development resources and documentation.
When I announced the BIP on the forums... it was ignored. Not sure what else I could've done to alert people. Maybe I'll write an article on it one day.

You read on the internet about older engineers who say that James Doohan (  ) playing Scotty in Star Trek inspired them to their profession, or others saying that the inspiring Carl Sagan (  ) and his poetic love of science, inspired them to become physicists.
It is because of Symphony of Science, that my sister became interested space and now studies astrophysics. She infected me with Carl Sagan, and rekindled a long held passion I held many years ago for science and introduced me to space - something I never really appreciated before in my life.
I never appreciate music either - until I heard Symphony of Science. I realised then that I'd been listening to the wrong music my whole life. This music speaks to me. Think of all the people these videos are inspiring into scientific professions or just plain more logical, rational and appreciative of our world thinking. This is a huge good for society.

While there I found a security flaw in the device which they hadn't considered (starvation attack through mass subscription). They've done no in-field testing or simulations of the device (mesh networks break down due to congestion collapse at larger scales). The device requires more capitalisation than the community has access to right now.
Not to diss the device though. It would be nice to be proven wrong.

There is no reason to have it simply depend on a single central server. In the future Electrum will depend on several servers to distribute the risk. This really makes any threat minimal. The more servers you add, the chance drops exponentially of being fed fake transaction history.
H_i is the set of collaborating servers.
r = risk of servers belonging to a certain H_i
n = number of connected blockchain services
R = r^n (risk of being fed a fake history)

Answer me this.
A lot of people in your position are using Intersango. It has been around for 1 year now and has never been compromised. We are a team of 5, and your use is funding bitcoin development. We ran the European Bitcoin Conference, own and operate Bitcoin Media, employ people to work on bitcoin, interact with bankers and legislators through Bitcoin Consultancy. We've actually done a ton of projects and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Our money goes back into the wider bitcoin economy at large. Oh yeah, and I run the BIP process.
Why do people using MtGox? MtGox who STILL hasn't paid many people back money which was stolen due to THEIR problems.
Or TradeHill? TradeHill who was generating fake volume when they first opened.

Are you fucking kidding me??? The US was directly responsible for all the shit going on in Iran now. They backed Saddam's invasion (opportunistic landgrab) which killed the most amount of people in any war since WW2, as he gassed entire cities (supported ofc by Donald Rumsfeld). Every family in Iran has close relatives who died in that war. I have family who died in that war. One uncle of mine has bullet wounds in his body, the other has a face damaged by shrapnel. The fascist regime in Iran is a direct cause of US actions in that country (see Operation Ajax on Wikipedia where they armed violent thugs and gangs in the street to cause instability and overthrow the democratically elected leader over oil). The US is also the only country to have detonated nuclear weapons and is highly active throughout the world with shadow armies and ongoing proxy wars.

Coinlab were the investors behind Bitcoinica. Tihan Seale and Peter Vessenes founded Coinlab together. Tihan bought Bitcoinica and Coinlab was involved from the beginning. Patrick Murck filed the legal papers on behalf of Bitcoinica investors.
We were given fake shares in a fake company. The deal was to contract us to work on Bitcoinica. The site had been losing money for months and had huge security problems. A new company was formed to handle that agreement.
After the first compromise, despite huge problems in the setup and design of the website, they wanted to put it back up as fast as possible. I was against this strongly which is why I released the code. After an employee used this as an excuse to steal more funds (the evidence is definitive), they were upset more over the loss of the 'Intellectual Property'.
They scapegoated me. They wanted no liability and refused to help us complete the job for them. All the emails are public on this forum (I released them) as proof. Donald kept asking to speak to their superior but they refused.
I never had access to money or any servers. I was a programmer working on the hedging algorithm.
They are sneaky, and play dirty tactics. Tihan is a manipulative sociopath.
We had run Intersango, the biggest UK exchange for 2 years without any problems doing 2 million GBP turnover annually. The site has been closed down (due to UK bank problems) paying everyone back and we experienced no security flaws during its history. I had no reason to deliberately cause Bitcoinica users any harm, and if you actually go and study the evidence on the forums, you'll see I acted in all of your best interests.
When everyone ran off, a programmer was told he was now acting CEO of a defunct company that never was formed and had to make executive decisions despite having no technical control or access to anything. Do you know how fucking absurd this is? Then to be told by many different parties conflicting things to sign for their personal interest and get blamed for that.
These are facts, and every point can be proven.

You don't even need to touch the protocol. If development is too centralised, then businesses will put real pressure to have features that destroy the integrity of the Bitcoin network. Stuff like p2p blacklists to create a 'legitimate' walled garden, or tracking technologies like large databases of IP addresses to triangulate where transactions came from. At the other end of the spectrum, is putting development effort into diversifying the ecosystem to protect against censorship and proxy relay nodes, anonymising mixers, small privacy tweaks and other technologies. That's where developers who believe in Bitcoin should devote our time to. We do not need more bullshit features for corporations. Serve the community.

I posted about this on the forums too: 
I think it's a really informative/interesting podcast about Bitcoin with food for thought.
Andrew puts forwards the argument about if the Bitcoin network ends up being rationally driven rather than the altruistic p2p model, then you could reach a point where some nodes start fucking over other nodes for self profit. If the incentives model is not correctly designed, Bitcoin could implode and that this is more of a risk than the 51% attack.
This reminds me of the Hawk and Dove model in evolutionary biology:
Bitcoin might have a possible built in solution. When Hawk and Dove models is used to simulate an ecological population, you often get a stabilising point. If you take a population of Doves and a few Hawks invade, then the invader species will have a big initial advantage. But after some time of swinging the population will swing less and settle on a proportion. This is called an Evolutionary Stable Strategy.
In the podcast, they use the example of miners on the blockchain. If a block contains a huge transaction fee of like 1000 BTC, then rational self interested miners will fight over the block and the blockchain will never have a chance to progress. It may be then that the best strategy is actually taking only a small slice and paying the rest to everybody else (pay off the hoard), so that others will build off your block instead of fighting for it.
When two valid blocks are created at the same time, they are in a race. They compete to have the next block built off them. Part of the problem is that miners build a new block before they discover the newly built block. This leads to a forking of the blockchain with the newly built block rejected.
Lets start by thinking how to solve this problem.
Ideally you'd want miners to discover new blocks before they create their own blocks. This step can be helped by clearing specialised paths between miners of high connectivity. The only use case for these paths is the rapid pulsing of new blocks throughout the network of miners (broadcasting).
Cutthroat efficiency is the key focus. Rapid deliverance of blocks to the targets (other miners) at low cost. The network's sole traffic is one node telling every other node about new blocks. Based on cost and topology, it's then conceivable to imagine hubs emerging. As the hubs grow, they condense outwards forming a backbone. We've seen this behaviour in other large scale networks with high traffic requirements like the internet. Attached nodes to this backbone are then given broadcast prioritisation based on how much they pay.
Our hypothetical miner loses 1% of mined blocks per month because they become orphaned. He calculates his average monthly loss to be $100. Then a broadcast service offers to cut his 1% to 0.1% for $20 per month. The miner now experiences a monthly loss of $10 + the $20 for the service. He has gained $70.
It doesn't matter what the actual numbers are. As the market expands, there will be a tipping point where the loss in expectation for a miner overcomes the cost of this service. As that industry grows and the services have to expand to meet capacity, then we see the gradual emergence of a backbone amongst miners.
When competing blocks are created, miners want other miners to accept and build off them. They might start paying other miners to accept their blocks. In effect saying “build off my block and I'll give you a share of the reward”, with a tit-for-tat relationship built up. Miners then must evaluate the likelihood of blocks becoming orphaned versus what share of the reward they will get from that block.
Since time is crucial, established agreements would become normal to codify this behaviour. You don't want to lose time negotiating. This behaviour becomes paying miners to prioritise your blocks in general. It's conceivable that a whole industry will arise of companies evaluating and scoring the mining capacity of various mining operations.
This has economic effects and could flatten the reward structure while decreasing variance among large scale operations. Mining could be a natural monopoly whereby miners experience increasing rates of return per unit as they scale their operations upwards. A simple example is the complex cooling arrangements increasing employed by mining farms. Custom setups or infrastructure might offer a far better return than small scale operations.
Against this backdrop, it's not hard to imagine a gentlemen's club forming. Everyone involved in that industry knows one another, and they have their own set of unwritten rules and agreements. The internet is like this.
This private club creates mutual infrastructure to improve their operations and establishes a backbone. Access to the backbone is prioritised either based on available mining capacity or how much you pay. There would need to be a mechanism for newly mined blocks to escape this backbone to the wider Bitcoin world. I imagine a second tier caching blocks and feeding them outwards on a slower network.

No idea. I don't have access to such hardware. But assuming you can compile C++11 (g++ 4.7 or newer), and get libboost / SSL the dependencies working then it should be fine. I don't have much experience with non-Intel processors (if someone would give me a server with an arm for testing that'd be great) but am welcoming the ability to support these architectures.

Errr no. This is a dangerously stupid stance to take. Monopolies are always a danger and threat to a standard. Do you want a massively bloated Bitcoin standard with proprietary extensions? That's what happens with centralisation of development effort (always).
Wait until all the co-opted Bitcoin businesses start lobbying for p2p blacklist features to create walled gardens and morph Bitcoin into corporatecoin. Already the new payments API feature doesn't help the black market, small businesses or p2p transfers. It's a feature for large corporate Bitcoin businesses. Why are devs not working on decentralised mixers and fully anonymous Bitcoin transfers? It's possible, but instead developers are focused on serving the needs of the foundation board members.

Yeah well except all the wars, secret police, corrupted corporations, destruction of the environment, squashing of individual spirit and global surveillance, the government is not all bad. They build schools and roads. What would we do without them???

I think you're misunderstanding him. It's about how the model as a whole functions. It's like in evolution where they have this big argument about whether or not evolution acts on the group level. Is it enough to model the system in terms of individual actors or do you instead look at the system as a larger whole.
You're incorrect about the models relying on altruistic individuals not working. There are plenty of systems that do. It simply depends on whether non-altruistic invader actors have the ability to exploit the system by taking advantage of the altruistic actors. Anyway it's not what Andrew is getting at in the podcast.

I copied the website from  so some of the questions remained the same. I will reword this later to reflect on our project more accurately.
I dont have much respect for the freemium model (core product opensource but pay for more features) or for software as a service. I prefer business models based off of writing custom code, providing customised or specialised wallets, and consulting.

They can't share the same tests because they both use different data structures (different codebases). It has its own set of tests (see tests/) and the Python suite already has a few (more coming).

Why are you not running Linux and supporting free software? So many BTC users talking about monetary freedom all the time. What about the other kinds of freedom? The cognitive dissonance is off the scale in this community.
And no, before you say it, convenience and freedom are different concepts.

I think it's limited by the amount of sigops that are allowed (which counts the multisig number). It's in the script code where it counts the number of opcodes. So whatever the block validation limit is.
Eligius seems to be the only one. Generic M of N is a great tool for cooperatively managing funds and establishing trust between a team of people.

As if. Everytime you mince words to win flattery and act complacent at moral wrongdoings, you are comrpomising and that is how the world gets shit. Stand up for what's right and be vocal. We don't need anyone except ourselves, our friends, our integrity and our spirit. Bitcoin is about building a new world for our children, not innovating on corruption.

I don't feel this deserved being downvoted, but the Apple fanboys are out in full force.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:57:47
you're deluded if you don't think this backdoor that gives remote access to apple's proprietary devices wasn't put there by apple or a group of apple employees. i highly doubt this was an accidental oops (unlikely). but whatever makes you feel comfortable...
we also know about the story with lavabit, and RSA. use your common sense before calling it a conspiracy. i guess you would have called the nsa spying program a conspiracy before snowden made it a fact bigger than any of us realised.

No, they are Electrum compatible. BIP-32 wallets will happen once Electrum and other clients start using them, and I have an implementation to follow and understand how to design a nice API for libbitcoin.

Nothing will change so long as you keep giving your consent to platforms that abuse their users. Withdraw your support for the NSA. Support free and open platforms as much as possible. They won't develop so long as you keep voting for walled gardens and proprietary platforms.
And you can argue that everyone is bad, but truth is that's a cop out to justify inaction.
