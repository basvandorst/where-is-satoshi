I've said for the last year, if it hits 10 I would sell for sure... and that's after watching myself lose, to me, tons of money. If bitcoin had held steady I wouldnt have thought of selling. Oh bitcoin you little whore, makin me feel feels. I will not sell at 10k. I will not sell at 10k. Say it with me! I SHALL HODL

Who's the 12k mascot?!?

Well, after kicking myself over and over again for laughing at my friends who bought 2 years ago, and making my apologies since lol, is anyone buying in/more at $8200?

I'm a nocoiner, wishing-theylistened-totheirfriends-yearsago-er. Watching closely, looking to buy in at 6k 7k if it takes another dip soon. There has to be a future for bitcoin. It's interesting to watch to say the least.

No, I put in a couple hundred in at 8301 ;]
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:07:30
I would do that.. but chase has barred from purchasing crypto. Unless people are still successfully using them..

After trying several times and getting a sign showing I bought bitcoin, and then having nothing in account.. it worked.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:53:45
I bought at 8301. I'll buy in some more set to alert at 7900. And then I will happily sit and watch for a long while . Stress free with just less than 1k to lose. Any more than that is when sweat would trickle. I know myself too well. Litecoin though, being that in a year everything has blown up.. I'm wondering If that's going to be a similar case. Especially reading about that more use in the dw

What form of payment is everyone using on coinbase. My only two cards are capital one and chase..... go figure

No, I just wasn't paying attention at all during the plummet. The light bulb never went off. Just went in. People always assuming some shit to make themselves feel brilliant.

I most definitely won't sink thousands.. I don't live life on the edge like that haha. But a few hundred doesn't hurt me. Figure my odds are better than the casino, and I'm down to do that whenever. And that's almost guaranteed I'm leaving way down lol
