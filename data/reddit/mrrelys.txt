BFLs CEO actually got in trouble for scamming on his previous venture. Did anyone pay attention to this? No...
Guess what happened? They used the preorder money to manufacture the units and mine themselves instead of shipping to customers. Once the customers received their units half a year past the shipping date they were worthless because of the spike in difficulty.
TL;DR: There's a special place in hell for BFL and I hope someone helps expedite that process.

If you've restored it to pre-jailbreak SSH will have disappeared.
When you do jailbreak your phone again remember to change the password. 
Some jailbreaks don't install SSH by default. What was the exploit you used? If your jailbreak didn't install SSH then that means the attacker had a different point of entry. You will need to identify, fix and remove any backdoors.
If your PC runs Windows I would scan with malwarebytes and windows defender. I would also look at processes/services running with sysinternals suite and open network connections with "netstat -antp".
I guess I should have mentioned that log files could be recovered from the iPhone if it was the point of entry which could help identify the attack before you erased it. IMO it's a lost cause to track anyone down if the attack was outside of the US though.

Can't you SSH into a jailbroken iPhone over the public IP space? Hackers scan public IP blocks for vulnerabilities.
Since your text messages were compromised I'm 80% sure this is this was the point of entry. You should wipe your phone and change your SSH password because it could still be backdoored. :0 Like, do it NOW.
