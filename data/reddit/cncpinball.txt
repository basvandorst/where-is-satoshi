A hard fork would be required to change to cap, and it could just become the new blockchain... I guess I don't see it as much different than addressing any other found shortcomings. I don't think anyone is buying/selling based on the cap, really, but all speculation on the market.
Bitcoin will likely change/fork over time, is my guess. Many things about it may change.

That implies everyone is having value stolen each time a block is mined over the next 120+ years. Extending that to 500 years or 1000 years makes little difference to anyone - we will be long dead before an end is reached.

Hmm I thought the mining rate was much slower but haven't stated on top of that.
We're the coins cap to change, I don't for a moment believe it's value would drop to zero. It is (quantity) inflating daily and yet it's value is deflating.
There value of bitcoin isn't immutability... at least not to me and many others. I don't see why it has to be completely unchanging to maintain its value. I suspect that were the number of coins 40 million it would have had the same trajectory.

The value isn't it's scarcity, it's the utility. 
The downside to a limited supply is concentration of wealth, and as it stands a strong propensity to hoard - one of the theoretical problems with deflationary currency that seems to be holding true.
I'm not saying it isn't attractive to have a chunk of a limited supply... on the contrary, everyone wants that kind of power... I'm saying that with the good comes bad, and you can work to mitigate the bad. If coin supply increases at a rate lower than adoption/demand, I don't see how it is problematic, personally.
That's different than doubling the coin  supply overnight though, which could result in a lot more spending and so inflation could occur.
To me, one of the most dangerous social aspects and dangers for bitcoins long term utility is a finite supply that can only shrink - concentrating wealth and rewarding hoarding.
But, the libertarian in me does see the appeal of having something which has undillutable value.... however, gold is mined all the time, effectively limitless in supply, and doesn't seem to be in less demand or suffering a crisis of any sort. Hell, gold can be made in a laboratory, artificially... it's just costly... as is mining bitcoins.

Taxes have been payed for years before current technology and methods were around.
Once the government started taking money that you ask for back during tax season it became far easier to spend frivolously and wastefully.
Requiring more justification for their spending is a good thing, not a bad thing. Having less direct access to everyone's pockets is a step in that direction.

$12 each seems pricey. At $1 they would be attractive to me.

Seems like the biggest real risk is that somebody just fakes the device itself.
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:47:52
Well yeah I guess if you think of this in terms of a cold storage solution, I can see that perspective... but I wouldn't have peace of mind large sums of money are stored in the long term on the device, personally.
My - possibly mistaken - understanding was that these were meant as a sort of way to pass money between people without having to transact on the block chain. At least, that's what appealed to me about it. 
However, unless you are making a significant sizable transaction, a $10 fee is quite steep for that scenario.
If this isn't the purpose of it, then I get that... I would like to see something similar that targets that goal. I wouldn't mind passing money around in this manner, personally... paying in bitcoin but not having to wait around for confirmations etc. or turning a purely digital transaction into something that can occur physically is interesting... but the transaction fee is raised by $10 this way.

I wonder if this is responsible for today's price tanking

If I recall he attempted to pay somebody to assassinate a guy, but it was the fbi

But it was part of the evidence presented for his kingpinning charges, correct?
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:36:12
I think this is a valid concern and one of the major criticisms of bitcoin.
The only real counter argument I'd that people are forced to buy some things, but that's not a model for supporting growth and innovation, but stagnation.

It seems to me that the "market cap" metric is a mistake that is going to confuse a lot of people and probably lose them money.

It was offline for like a minute... i've been refreshing it constantly.... My guess is that there was wide panic selling and their servers had to auto scale.

That would destroy a country. You're basically describing greece.

While I wouldn't personally make that same decision, many if not most people vote based on only a handful of issues that are important to them.
Foreign policy, budgets, gun control, women's rights, regulation, and so on, tend to be driving forces in american politics. So much so that these specific wedge issues are often identified and targeted by the parties in order to split the vote advantageously.
If one believes that the republican party best serves the interests that are near and dear to them, it makes sense to side with them.
It may be wiser to take a more holistic approach and compromise your important values for a wider set of less important values. Who can say though? Only the individual can make such a call.

Or just buy it at the pot store with cash....?

Their growth is absolutely insane during this period of frenzy.
A lot of optimizations and scaling decisions you would make for a typical "content" website don't necessarily apply to a financial service. It takes a LOT of "be careful in what the fuck you do" code, because you can't lose finances, double count finances, etc.
Couple that with the fact that the nature of cryptocurrency requires time and confirmations before you can reliably count it as transferred, and you lose more and more scaling tricks.

Nope. Silly question.

Probably somebody liquidating a large holding, so price dropped, then a bunch of nervous people freaked out and sold before it dropped to zero, causing more dropping. Everyone else is just yawning.

It was part of the evidence used to land the kingpinning charges etc...
It's quite silly to claim that lack of being charged with a crime is the same as not doing the deed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:23:43
Killings... no killings but attempted to hire a killer to kill someone.
Innocent until proven guilty refers to the legal system and whether someone can be punished for a crime. That doesn't bear on whether someone did something or not. There are also other factors that determine whether someone will or can be charged with a crime.
In any event the evidence did show that he attempted to hire payed killers to murder someone. That evidence was used to get a conviction on related charges.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:40:58
I don't think you understand what we are talking about. There wasn't a murder or a claim of murder.

Sure, i hate the two party system, but it's pretty much unavoidable in our current voting paradigm. I hope to see a better growth of third parties, but my only real expectation of outcome from that would be that the other parties are forced to adopt the third parties positions to gain their votes.
"Teams" is probably the wrong way to look at it, but the various parties DO have official positions on issues, and if they back those positions up with their own actions, in theory it would greatly influence how you align with them in voting.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:03:37
There is a very low likelihood that your voting practices aren't primarily influenced by a handful of key issues.
Maybe you're special, could be.

Long term I don't see BTC as viable for ordinary low value transactions. Possibly with other layers like lightning but overall I suspect it won't be the sort of thing you buy coffee with. 
The success of BTC is simultaneously freezing its adaptability and increasing its value to the point of being something very different than originally thought.
My bet is behind another cryptocash that follows all of the same principles but solves the emergent problems BTC faces... litecoin is my current guess, but it could be anything really that manages to capture adoption for any number of reasons.
Hell, an entire sub economy emerged around rare pepes. Who could see that coming? My guess is its the first version of something much bigger... the kernel is there, and even just a meme, community, tastemaker, etc can be what pushes it to the tipping point.

Liquidating generally means to sell off. That can take any form I suppose.
