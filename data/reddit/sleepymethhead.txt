The developing markets (small counties) are just a precursor. We’re all gonna feel this imo ��. But cryptos will likely survive and THRIVE on the other side of this. 
The worst AND best may be yet to come. HODL ur coins. Maybe hedge with Gold and Silver in the interim...but HODL!

Was investing $100 on bitcoin when it was .10 cents special?
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:58:05
Too many millennials (I’m one) don’t care about buying bitcoin because it’s not over a million dollars yet! 
They don’t understand you have to buy it when BEFORE it goes up. The herd only supports winners.

I sure hope this vision is fulfilled. I’m sure BTC will be a great store of value for many many years to come. 
If BTC can successfully scale and silence the haters and think we’re golden.

Me too man. Lol it ain’t happening tho. BTC is never goin under $1000 ever again
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:37:32
True. Hopefully they dump that fiat into something with real value as well, for their sake. 
If not... they lost in this trade.
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:11:17
Lol this guy an OG of paid shills. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:32:44
Every other coin isn’t doing so hot. BTC went from like 1k to 20k in one year... we gotta cool off a bit. Good buying opportunity tho. 
BTC isn’t better than or necessarily going after the banking system...but it’s life blood, the $dollar. The banks are already buying BTC behind the scenes to be ready to use their bank magic with the shiny new currency! A currency that cannot be printed out of thin air. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:15:52
You just gotta read the tea leaves man to be as confident as I am about it... 
But look into the lightning network a bit. You don’t think they won’t have BTC in some lightning channels ready for transacting? 
The NYSE is opening a crypto trading desk and it’s owner says himself bitcoin could be the ‘First worldwide currency’. The institutions that Coinbase is pulling and hiring from is staggering.
The over the counter markets have been booming in this bear market... I’m no genius but I’d like to think some bank somewhere got into BTC before me. At LEAST as a hedge...
But no... the federal reserve didn’t show me their books.
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:44:58
Lol people r gonna keep hating crypto bro it’s fine. Keep accumulating good cryptos in this bear market! 
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:49:28
So crypto has to grow bigger for it crash bigger. Makes sense. Just hope to be around for the growth, hopefully the crashes will be higher than your entry points. 
But also early miners have all the ammo to live like Kings forever if they’re still holding... even at 6k. So any of them still holding must believe we’re going higher eventually.
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:09:01
Unless they’re taking profits all the way down to zero HODLing is just fine if you’re not lookin for a quick flip.

Gullible guppies that deserve to get ate up. If they hold thru the tough times those guppies will grow into groupers imo.... 
U just gotta be ballsy in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:37:48
HODLers could trade some BTC over to the banks to loan out... in exchange for all the hard assets (property) those banks have stolen over time.  Seems like a plausible ways for banks to stay in business.
I can see early miners/hodlers becoming new power players in the world economy.
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:57:55
It’s LN or bust baby. Hodl on tight!
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:54:42
Most people who don’t believe in this long term have already left. People talk like this every bear market.  
Not liking crypto is fine, but you obviously don’t understand the fundamentals of the technology if you’re willing to just write it all off as a scam.
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:52:45
I’m loving this suppressed market. I entered crypto 1 year ago and never thought I’d see these prices again after the run up. 
The herd has the wrong perspective.
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:49:54
Every excuse to avoid bitcoin is bullshit. It’s ok. People only care when the price goes up. Feel sorry for any no coiner out there.
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:58:11
Been aware...scared. Once the bear market started I decided to hunker down and accumulate all the crypto and precious metals I can.
I haven’t even left my city this year... it doesn’t bother me at all. I know the benefits will be reaped.
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:09:29
I pray to god it does. I’ll own soo much BTC. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:36:38
Your agreeing with me. I stated that I’m speculating. I sayd I never saw the federal reserve books. I don’t KNOW for a fact. But all my speculation is based on a combination of facts. &amp; I know a bit about economics. And hedges are a major thing. 
But if I got into BTC before ANY banks. I guess I’m smarter than the banks. (I doubt) Big institutions never show their hand, so until they come out and say “Hey we have a bunch of BTC” all you can do is speculate... but I’m willing to connect the dots and lean a certain way. 
But Yale is a new institution that actually HAS admitted to acquiring crypto. If the banks are happy with being last to potential massive gains that are clear to be had while you currently have a blank check and those blank checks are running out. I’d just be very very surprised. 
But as I said before... no one showed me all their secret documents... so it’s all speculation. But pretty solid imo. But message me in 10 years let’s see.... I’m willing to wait over 20 years really.

If Craig Wright really has the power to compromise BTC he should’ve stayed anonymous. Huge target on his back ESPECIALLY  if he isn’t lying... he can’t win either way.
I never thought Satoshi was one person. If anything Craig was the asshole of the group who contributed very little... n it took 10 years for him to start swinging his baby dick around.

Kek. Gold is only so ‘volatile’ due to the whole thing being manipulated via the COMEX to keep the dollar “stable”. 
This is the whole reason bitcoin was invented. The hardcap is one thing that’s makes it difficult to rig long term.

Possibly a golden opportunity for those with an appetite for risk... and a little youth to burn. 
I can’t imagine 4:1 in a world where everyone understands the value of BTC... WHEW.
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:10:56
4LTC to 1BTC is high.... but it would make sense if LN ends up virtually making LTC and BTC combine into ONE pool of liquidity. 
It’s totally possible if LN goes as planned.

Nice... you might wish u bought 1 at a time tho. I’m bullish longterm but I don’t think we’ve bottomed.

Wepay moves the Yuan around... as long as the Yuan survives China won’t need to make any adjustments. I’m just not a fan of any fiat currencies long term.
