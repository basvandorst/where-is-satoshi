they didn't even use multi-sig in their accounts.
And opnly BTC was stored in cold wallets, all other alts were stored in HOT wallets!
No wonder they were hacked......

I find it ironic that we are invested in currencies that will "change" the financial world, yet everyone has their "moon" were their life will change. Once they reach it they sell their crypto, be it BTC, eth, xrp whatever... They take their fiat, make a post and sayonara.

About what exactly? The Nasdaq Bitcoin futures? It's been discussed a bunch. 
Some are welcoming the CME and NASDAQ futures and some are not. 
I'm in the not camp...  These futures will flood so much money into the game which is good, the problem though is that with futures you're betting on the price to drop. 
These wall street pros will short sell the shit out of Bitcoin, it will rise initially (25k, 30k, 40k, who knows?) but then fall alot and struggle to make new all time highs from that point on.

That's tough luck man!  Without the private key, which would have been on your old lap top, you're pretty much SOL dude. Those coins are gone forever. 
One bit of advice,. Don't look at it as losing 200k. Because if you had known about your 20btc there is no way you would have held this long. You would have likely parted ways with them before they hit $1000....  Try and focus on that to help you not go mad.
So sorry.

This is what I'm worried about. Holding lots of USD and USDT on bittrex right now with the intention to buy up once the bloodbath is over.
But at this rate bittrex is just going to f off with all our money, and most exchanges with them. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:29:03
What about USD on Bittrex?
@_date: 2019-01-06 13:46:49
Typical delusional Hodler mentality. 
Did you use the same logic when it was $10,000? Because if a person took your advice then as well they missed out on having 2.5x as much Bitcoin if they waited until today. And when Bitcoin drops to $1000 they would have missed out on 10x as much Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, going with our current conversation people following your psychotic Hodler mentality buying $3,800 BTC today are missing out on 3x potential BTC when it drops to the $1000's. 
Now, let's say BTC does hit $1,000,000 one day.  Would you rather have 1BTC or possibly 3x or 10x that or even more?
So it's US who laugh at delusional Hodler's like you my friend haha. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:02:19
Who do you think manipulates BTC/Crypto prices?
It's the banks, as y'all HODL'd they bought and sold on the way down making massive profits, and will continue to do so as BTC tumbles below $1000 in 2019.
WAKE UP!
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:29:55

Hard NO, but just for now. 
Wait until it drops below at least $1000 to maximize profits. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:02:53
You're right it might not. And it's not about "timing" the market. 
But being %100 hodl all the time over the last year was the worst move. 
I'm 50/50. Half in crypto half in cash, scooping up more and more as it goes down. 
no hard feelings. I'm pro crypto like you, but advising people to just hodl is BAD advice. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:16:34
Ok... But come 10 years from now you could possibly have 2x, 5x, 10x etc as much BTC as you do right now if you didn't just HODL. 
So what you're saying is that some dumb meme trading philosophy like HODL is more important than maximizing your total BTC holdings. 
Good luck in life. 
Don't bother responding I won't read your reply and waste another second of my life debating this with you.

He is saying that Bitcoin is at an all time high, so if you by RIGHT now you will likely lose money in the short term.
Maybe wait for it to pull back a bit under 5000 and then buy then?
