Do you have any good examples? I'd like to post more.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:16:30
Why not just buy all those things in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:45:31
The press release was pretty ambiguous about "recent events in the bitcoin community," but they next stated reason is clear, that the price of bitcoin has "spiked." I don't know how one would short through Mt.Gox, except I did read an interesting post about someone trying to play the discrepancy of Ltc/USD vs Ltc/BTC vs BTC/USD in a pseudoshort.

Some of you have donated. Thanks so much. The Bitcoin community is made up of some great people who really want to change the world with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:08:38
what happens if the market crashes? is it just cacophony? lol, but really cool

You're correct, I removed the subheading "Haters." I do feel that it is a general criticism of Bitcoin. The consensus is that "1%" is a pejorative.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:10:23
Here's my take on it. Let me know if I'm way off base.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:05:24
Average size of buy and sell orders. Ratio of the two. As in if a 10 BTC trade is executed, I want to know if it is one person selling 10 BTC and 10 people buying 1 BTC each, or whatever it happens to be, on a market wide scale.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:39:55
No. And if that rainy day ever comes, just spend it as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:55:15
I think it's impossible to say. But from a distance, it absolutely looks like a bubble. Any commodity that increases in value that much that fast better also cure cancer. And thats what a lot of people are saying, that BTC just isn't producing $1 bil worth of value therefore must be overvalued. But. . . no one who is actually trading in BTC seems to be afraid from what i can tell
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:15:40
It doesn't feel like frenzy behavior?
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:02:24
DO IT, MAKE MY DAY
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:31:17
Talking about bitcoin can be so exhausting lol :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:43:00
Thanks. I'm look for data specific to Silk Road.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:28:44
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:27:56
What's your suggestion for a more accurate comparison?
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:03:51
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:31:17
How can it be both? Bitcoin is resilient. So yes, even if the price tanks over the long haul it will rebound and then some. But if it is a bubble, it can not continue at this pace.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:37:49
and many others in the Bitcoin community feel that coverage of Bitcoin is often inaccurate. evidence: 
"With the increasing popularity of Bitcoin many, many news articles are being written which contain blatant misinformation and factual errors about Bitcoin." 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:37:37
"Bitcoin will give the cause several advantages."
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:15:08
Where do you guys get the stat on gox? that's interesting
Just the tip, lol
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:15:07
Do you mean to a different wallet or to trade somewhere else?
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:34:41
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:29:26
but seriously, my friend has turned to the Bitcoin community to help a dying Chinese orphan get heart surgery.
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:59:48
you're a stud holding on to them so long, wow. I do believe they will be successful, but there will be adjustments. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:46:34
Lol, for sure. That kind of money changes people's lives. Especially if they save it for a while and the exchange rate breaks through the previous high (but at a moderate pace this time guys!) :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:17:36
You're right, except that a lot of journalists are not doing their homework. Here's some examples: 
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:25:23
Thanks, I'll take care of that typo :)
And lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:03:45
Absolutely. But you're telling me that on the whole journalists know what they are talking about when it comes to Bitcoin? I am not disparaging the profession, but journalists certainly do err. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:51:06
I donated .2 BTC, could we get some more donations going? If nothing else, let's prove to the world that Bitcoin has a real impact. Josh decided to reach out to the Bitcoin community, let's show him the power of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:55:35
Thanks, do you have a source for this?
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:32:11
right now, just blogger
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:01:47
Maybe, but it will continue to bring exposure to the issue and possibly start a national discussion on the merits of regulating/ not regulating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:52:47
Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:54:30
Lol. I feel like it is similar to the attempts by the government to regulate video game content in the early days of that industry. People were concerned about violence etc, but the industry was proactive and pushed back to create it's own rating/ regulation system i.e. esrb
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:48:27
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:26:06
I guess we'll all find out.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:57:17
Thanks, pass it along and maybe they will :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:45:14
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:10:26
Thanks man, I'll pm you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:41:35
Read the letter. I don't care what they write about Bitcoin, just that they don't make major errors in the process. They could say bitcoin is going to crash in an opinion piece. That's fine. I just would like to see them not make fundamental errors about Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:10:40
Got mad stacks cuz I'm rippin that hash/ mining all the time, with babbage on my mind/ FinCen's on my bitcoin for that financial crime
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:02:58
"Due to recent events in the Bitcoin community and the spike in the Bitcoin price we at Mt.Gox are putting in place a new daily withdrawal limits." from 
They would have to cause a full spread panic, but it would be risky to do so.
