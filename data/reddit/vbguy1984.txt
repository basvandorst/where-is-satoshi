So you want all the massive gains but can’t handle the large dips?  Do you not understand risk?

Wonder how these icos will fund themselves now.

No. What they are doing is managing their risk by limiting their exposure to crypto.  Nobody is stopping you from using cash for your purchase.

I’ve never been able to purchase stocks with credit cards. Please show me where you can. The only credit I get is my margin account with my brokerage.

Terrible example considering Dodd frank reform spawned out of MBS collapse and now regulates the amount of risk banks can take on mortgages. Have you purchased a home recently?  Not so easy to get a mortgage anymore. You even have to trace funds on the earnest money deposit to ensure the buyer didn’t borrow that money from someone else. Nice try though.

Antitrust laws wouldn’t have anything to do with him banning crypto ads.

You played with fire. Hopefully you learned a lesson. It’s not the end of the world.

Lol. Hold onto your panties sweetheart. Far from new.

I said the exact same thing the other day regarding cc companies limiting their exposure and I got the typical tinfoil hat responses that banks just don’t want competition, etc. It’s nice to finally see some other level headed comments regarding this.

I love watching you people try to explain and understand futures markets and their effect on assets.

No it’s not silly. Silly would be allowing a bunch of uneducated wannabe traders and investors to max out their loanable funds on something so risky.  A bank absolutely will limit its exposure to crypto as they should.  Your default risk is much higher than someone using credit for simple purchases such as household items and consumables. Don’t like their decision? Use your own funds to purchase bitcoin.  Assume the risk yourself.

Lol. So bitcoin crashes and now you want regulation and government intervention?  Lmao. Amazing.

I can tell just by your lingo that you definitely don’t trade in equity markets and have very little understanding of how financial markets operate and correlate.  The fact that you even compare this sell off to 2008 tells me that you probably weren’t even old enough to feel the brunt of the recession.  Keep trading your alts though and good luck to you.

I imagine op probably lives in his parents basement and reads tons of conspiracy website material all day while tracking his 100 dollar bitcoin investment he made probably around August of last year. He hates the stock market because he doesn’t understand how it works and thinks one day banks will be overthrown in favor of a technology that has yet to even prove it could serve as a viable medium of exchange for goods and services

You could try a cardboard box in an alley. That’s probably a good start for you to abandon the dollar.

The financial crisis of 08 and what’s happening in the markets today are 2 completely different things. 08 was a liquidity issue caused by rising defaults on MBS and CDOs. The sell offs last week into this week were caused by spiking yields on 10 year bonds. Rising yields will always spark a sell off in the stock market. We are in the midst of reverse qe and the fed is tightening the money supply to slow inflation. Essentially the economy is becoming too strong because low interest rates have been around too long. It’s going to get a little tougher before it corrects properly and things can continue upward.
