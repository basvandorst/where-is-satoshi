Bitcoin Cash is too.

I mine BCH. it’s been very profitable

There’s no guarantee 401k’s will be down 50% next year. Nor will bitcoin be up 500%
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:13:14
It’s not a “shit” article. It’s the truth. Bitcoin is down because there’s NO DEMAND for right now
@_date: 2019-11-07 04:10:17
It can too be replaced. Just like anything else. It’s naive to think otherwise.

Being the 1st crypto currency around doesn’t guarantee that everyone will adopt it. Everyone knows and uses Googles search engine. No one remembers Alta Vista’s search engine established in 1995. Despite them been first. The bottom line is never put all your eggs in one basket.

Your missing the point
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:32:52
There Ethereum and bitcoin cash will still be around too.

Bitcoin Isn’t Down Because of China, It’s Down Because You Don’t Need It

Bitcoin Cash has been very good to mine
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:28:08
I mine bitcoin cash
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:15:50
That is not living.

The 2020 halving isn’t guaranteed to generate any extra demand.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:19:44
10 year bull market = real 
Unemployment 50 year low = real
Median Household income rising = real
2017 Bitcoin Rally = Fake
@_date: 2019-12-25 01:03:43
Demand is what will allow the price to rise
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:38:37
Cryptocurrencies need institutional investors
@_date: 2019-12-24 20:27:46
Doesn’t matter what the supply if there is more sellers than buyers.  Having less supply doesn’t mean more people will buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:23:24
The Stock market rally is not fake
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:49:48
Still don’t see any demand
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:24:18
Highly doubt BTC will be up 300% in 2020. Demand just isn’t there.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:10:04
Still no demand right now to put upward pressure on the price. I don’t think the 2020 halving will effect the price one way or another either.
@_date: 2019-12-25 01:17:30
If demand stays the same as it was before the halving. The price will drop. Still need more people buying.
