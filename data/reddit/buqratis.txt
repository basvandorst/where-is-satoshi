Most bitcoin users and miners *by a huge margin* supported NYA. At the time almost everyone agreed it was the best move. It was really shady and non democratic that it never happened.

These rules were determined long ago in the white paper.

Of course it is the real chain. This is how an attack works and that’s why people are concerned by it. Non-Chinese chain enthusiast would have to use an alternative chain. It would likely be a popular one, but it would 100% be a fork of the original chain.

Yes it does.

If 99% of users and miners and nodes switched all an once to a slightly improved chain are you really arguing it would be an altcoin?? the chain with only 1% left on it would still be the main chain??

why fix if notbroken? If 99% of users and miners and nodes switched all an once to a slightly improved chain are you really arguing it would be an altcoin?? the chain with only 1% left on it would still be the main chain??

switching to the BU rules can happen under current consensus rules...

How do you misunderstand blockchain technology so fundamentally?
