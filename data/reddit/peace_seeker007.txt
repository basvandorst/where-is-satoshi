100% True. I learned my lesson during the China ban. Now hodling for dear life. :D It's better that all the weak hands are shaken off now. When we hit 60k this year, and dip down to let's say 40k, strongs hands will not sell. And there will be very little weak hands left. Recent drops are just the piller of future price imo.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:13:05
Exactly. I was thinking the same thing. When it was hitting 17250 yesterday, people started to eat the wall. I wonder what happens with people when it's at a dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:24:57
Lol. You sold. Didn't you? Hahahahahahha 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:43:51
Yes. If you buy or sell coin at market price, there is a fee of 0.25%. So for every $10000, it's $25. But if you buy or sell with a limit order, there is no fee at all. And you can use your linked bank account with coinbase to deposit and withdraw. Free of charge. And NO withdraw fee of coins to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:05:53
It's normal. Don't panic. Due to high traffic, It's taking longer than usual. 
And honestly won't be able to stop using coinbase. Haha. It's free!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:34:08
Pm me. I think I can help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:23:40
My dad had a bank checking account in Chase bank. He bought a little bitcoin back in May with 3 back to back deposit. Later chase bank called my dad and gave him one month to close his account. They said 'we can't disclose the reason behind this account closure' 
They are scared as hell
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:12:51
Tomorrow is monday. A lot of bank deposit will clear tomorrow. I see only rise in price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:19:51
Sorry bro. U rekt :( 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:12:59
Yes, only if your are using coinbase app. Login to gdax with your coinbase email and password. Gdax doesn't have any fees on withdrawing btc. 
Gdax and coinbase is same.

How old is your friend? If he is in early 20's, I think he can afford to take the risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:41:46
I am not sure about that. I always use gdax to transfer my coin to my hardware wallet without any fees. I am sure it doesn't have any fees
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:30:39
Shhhhh. Don't tell everyone lol. Keep it Lowkey:p 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:50:32

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:40:22
Lmao. They all are now philosophers.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:33:30
Haha during the china ban the dip was $2950 :p 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:57:30
Please buckle up everyone. Spaceship will lunch soon. The journey to 25k begins here. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 05:57:18
Thanks buddy! This helps a lot!
@_date: 2019-11-04 02:57:15
I am sorry to ask this. I don't have much experience with those exchanges. Are those reliable? Have you used those?
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:06:20
Beg to differ. Once you have money, you can buy a new set of friends.
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:19:40
You say virtual currency?  You mean PayPal, Online transaction! Sure IRS.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:11:46

@_date: 2019-10-29 03:51:07

@_date: 2019-10-28 23:42:37
It will be stuck in the blockchain forever.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:41:52
Interested. Please inbox me
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:57:28
Did it work for you? If I decide to buy a little from my each paycheck, why will it make me sick? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:45:42
That's some refreshing information :3
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:24:05
What a shit post
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:56:25
So if I buy bt1 from bitfinex now, I will be in the core blockchain after the fork? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:06:42
Yes. I am waiting for a dip eagerly. When do you think the dip will come? And what's your price prediction?
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:33:26
I hope your words come true. I have been stacking cash on my coinbase account for the dip.
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:17:44
I will still have 10% left. 40% bitcoin, 30% bt1, 30% bt2. Not a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:16:05
True indeed. I got to know about bitcoin when it was around $1100. I thought the price was too high. Then it went to $2000. I thought it will drop. I was wrong. Maybe a couple of years later, we will look at the chart and wish we had bought more at $4000
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:57:39
Hopefully we will get some kind of direction about the replay protection after the hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:57:44
Probably just me? �� 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:37:01
Yup. Saw south Korean people tweeting there might be a ban on exchanges too. South Korea and China working together to prevent hacking from North Korea.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:12:17
Yup. Haha. Waiting for the dip to come this month. Lots of fomos
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:34:17
Thanks man for taking the time to write it. Appreciate it. I really hope it drops below $3500 again before the fork :(
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:50:24
It takes 3-5 days to get the bitcoin in your account. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:09:58
It's safe for now. But if price actually goes up  in the future like people are saying it would.Then I would advice you to transfer your coins to a different safer wallets. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:00:38
To the earth. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:15:18
Say no more. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:23:13
Even I got confused seeing the gif. Had to check the price of BTC. And I am not even a bot lol
