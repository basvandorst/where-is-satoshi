Sure it's not difficult, but it needs to be pre-installed on the phone. My best guess would be an option in the already existing camera. It's a super convenient tool, and I can see it being popular, but nobody wants to install a separate camera on their phone to do one thing.

Yea, until you can take your phone out of your pocket, press one button and search a QR code, there's not a lot of hope.

Something tells me bitcoin isn't going to get you groceries in the event of a digital apocalypse.

It sounds like you're saying they're purposefully withholding information, which is common among any news channel. 'Extremely biased' might be an exaggeration.
I do have my doubts about RT's overall legitimacy, but I still find it to be decent. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:46:23


Can confirm, as the person who introduced me (actually it was just second-hand exposure) to RT is one of these people.

I can understand them specifically steering from their country's faults, but to specifically target the US (their biggest demographic I presume) would be a silly idea.
I haven't ever really agreed with their stances, but I can't say I don't enjoy their shows from time to time. 
Nonetheless, I'm interested to hear their stance on Bitcoin. Unfortunately they're going live as Bitcoin drops to 315 -_-

With more people involved it could reach crazy heights. Due to it being a little rocky out of the gate, it just needs more exposure and buyer confidence. Oh Hello, *Microsoft.*

I'd say about two more.

Can confirm. The only time I've ever felt like I was on top of it was when I bought around 300 or 350. Held 1/3 btc for around a week and sold after it dropped $10. I've concluded that I'm not getting rich from BTC but watching the process has been really crazy and I respect the people making it happen.

What if it was zero tomorrow? And the next day. And the *next* day.

My point is it's not really worry free if you can still lose your money in an unrecoverable way. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:46:48
I know this is supposed to be like an uplifting thing for bitcoin regulars, but I gotta say it aint true. You wish you could go back in time to buy more because you know *for a fact* that you will make the crazy profits we saw. Can't compare going back in time and betting on bitcoin to buying bitcoin today.

Are you assuming traders are just rolling the dice and praying?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:40:08
What does that have to do with anything? Or are you just being butthurt for no reason?

@_date: 2017-09-15 18:24:33
Not if you make a calculated decision and profit from it. This sub is using "hodling" as a way to use teamwork to retain value, which is great and I'm all for it, but saying that trading is always blind dice roll is manipulative.

I just moved out of my apartment and you best believe something like this is getting the bin.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:53:02


That is incorrect.
@_date: 2019-09-29 00:24:57
Tends to happen with big subs. A bunch of people subscribe, low effort content gets upvoted from people skimming their front page, and the community that's been around gets alienated.
That's how I feel anyway. I've seen subs go to complete shit, and people who speak up about it are met with "well people are upvoting it so clearly you're the minority".

I accepted a $10 payment in bitcoin once. Needless to say I'm holding ;)

I read "5-10 million in passive investments will get your foot in the door" as equating that amount of money to an internship.
