ah, I know the feeling - excitement to find a btc atm and then disappointment to find it to be not working. Had the same experience in Bangkok - but yeah, it is exciting to see these!

like u/pdubl said, buying on regular basis. What this does is change your *average* price - say you bought 0.1 btc at $10,000 (your avg price is $10,000); you buy another 0.2 btc at $5,000, so now you have 0.3 btc and spent $2,000; your *average* price is $2000/0.3 \~$6,667

relax, there's not much you can do right now and c'mon you always knew that there is a risk and a day like this may come. It has. But again, this shall pass soon - so don't worry too much since not much can really be done right now, Once it recovers in next few days/weeks - put only the money you can afford to lose.

store your coins offline - paper wallet is the simplest. When you need to trade them (sell), then you need exchange (like kraken) and that is when you transfer coins back to exchange(kraken) so that you can sell

this looks awesome, will check this out.
On a side note, could you please help me in understanding on how does one even go about doing something like this - getting some items via API, letting users search &amp; putting all this together on a site(deploying) - a broad bullet point steps would be good enough for me to explore more
