Mycelium is what you want.

The FBI's statements clearly show a **lack of fundamental understanding of communication via the Internet.** Next step is to make it **mandatory** to place FBI-Certified bugging devices **in EVERY home** .... because after all, terrorists **could POSSIBLY use personal homes** to communicate and gather in.

What is the bitwage feature as relates to Airbitz? 
I had not heard of that. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-30 15:16:55
Good luck. The bitcoin community is about as organized &amp; coherent as the republican party. It's been a clusterfuck from the beginning, unfortunately.

localbitcoins in mexico, is the way to do it...

Thank you. You are the second person to suggest Arnhem. And I knew nothing about it before today!
This sounds amazing: "Arnhem Bitcoincity" 
It's now at the top of my list &amp; a *must visit*!

I like Airbitz &amp; Copay, also. Copay offers multisig for additional protection of your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 08:43:56
grazie !
Edit: Rovereto sounds amazing, and have added it to my top 3 places.

I hear miners know how to do it with an abacus, too ;-) 
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:52:50
Very interested to know how it is nowadays. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:50:29
I'd like to know how this would work. Not clear on the steps. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 01:06:03
People should be made aware of the fact that ATMs may prompt user for ID and even have camera at the ATM. Upshot: So, one has to take appropriate precautions for privacy. 
Edit: Someone else reminded me that ATMs sometimes also require a phone number as part of the process.

I think he (nopara73) knows that. He's just being argumentative. Or perhaps he's a bitcoin beginner and didn't know, that's possible, I suppose. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 04:49:22
I have to disagree with your implication that the people behind the wallet in question are 'corrupt humans' 
@_date: 2016-11-14 12:30:17


Can you elucidate that statement? How has the network been compromised by 1 mb blocks? I don't understand. Thanks.

Learn to go around the banks, not through them. You don't need them. Hope your lesson was learned.

You don't have to use your bank to purchase bitcoin, regardless of how your employer pays you. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 23:13:17


No, to both of those things. Thanks to Big Banking, bitcoin is an island unto itself. 
If you don't sell thru localbitcoins or other similar method, your best bet is to hold on for the ride. 
Bitcoin was never intended to play with traditional banking/government issued 'money.'  It was meant to replace them.

The 'land of the free,' USA, is the **least friendly** toward bitcoin, unfortunately. And it's only just going to get worse in the US. In face, the IRS in the USA is getting ready to **database everybody** who uses exchanges like coinbase &amp; they are even taking legal action to do so.

Airbitz is an excellent app but I'd like the ability to turn OFF all access to personal information. Can this be made optional in settings? If so, problem solved for those who don't want to grant access to any personal information. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:25:49
Thanks for the update. It's reassuring. Mycelium is a great app &amp; I look forward to using it for a long time! 
@_date: 2016-05-04 04:10:37
You make good points. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 09:24:44
Im looking at the PLAY STORE itself (current). Not the app, or old version 
@_date: 2016-05-11 09:28:34
Yes, I'm aware with the most current Android OS that you can do these things. 
However, my post is about WHY these personal &amp; private details are sought by the apps, in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 11:14:20
Marshmallow, latest. I see TODAY's Mycelium update just now. Mycelium no longer seems to request my phone Identity. Good to know. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:29:56
Application settings. In many apps, if you deny permissions, the app breaks. I'd prefer to have the option within the app itself, to just 'check' and disable. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 06:55:24
I dont share that misconception. I actually do believe that Airbitz is not out to 'hoard user data' but that is not the point. Many users like myself guard our privacy as a result of principle and/or bad past experiences. I still say allowing the user at least the OPTION to disable accessing any personal information is a very good thing. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 08:50:49
You made me double check :) 
It shows (current play store): "Identity: Find accounts on device" 
@_date: 2016-05-11 21:59:46
Let us know what you discover. Many people are interested. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-05-11 19:42:21
Thanks for your reply, Rassha. Is google play store wrong? I looked just now after reading your post, and google play store shows "Identity: Find accounts on device" and also "view network connections." Can you explain what personal network details Mycelium needs to know &amp; the reason. Thanks. 
See the Google Playe Store &amp; view "Permissions ... Details" and you will see what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:35:49
I wouldn't rely on AES and wouldn't upload anywhere, if you want to be genuinely secure. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:09:53
Sounds perfect.  Thanks.

Use Coinbase if you want all your personal &amp; private bitcoin business to be in a government database. 'nuf said.
