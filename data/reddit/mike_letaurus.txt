Alternatively time could reverse and the line could move backwards. If this happens, remember, I called it.

I'm already in at 1800 and 2500
I don't know if I can justify buying in at an ATH
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:28:27
With blackjack, and hookers
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:47:39

This graphic makes it look like if I write someone a check for $100, by bank will then Venmo their bank $100.

It's a wallet. When your coins are in coinbase, you don't hold the keys, so you don't actually possess the coins.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:17:48
So if I'm holding one bitcoin right now, after the fork will I still have one bitcoin and no BCC? Or will I have some fraction of both?

If my bank account closed my account without warning and had zero customer support
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:23:19
Jesus I'm uncomfortable keeping $50 on coinbase how do you live with yourself keeping 200k
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:05:38
I don't exchange for fiat. I hold.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:33:22
Buy on coinbase, immediate transfer to electrum
