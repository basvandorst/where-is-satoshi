That's exactly what I came here expecting to see :D. Jewish stereotypes.

Could this question be akin to "How many idiots are there?"?

Wow, I love those minimalist designs!

Just out of interest, where is the backdoor on TrueCrypt? There was always the cold boot option and passwords are stored in the RAM but do you mean there is an actual backdoor left on purpose?

Why not upload your app to F-droid? Everybody can access that although I am not sure if they offer progressive permissions.

My reply from mobile didn't seem to go through! In any case, I made the backup, just in case. Made some small transactions to verify it all works and now it's on the move. Thank you for your reasonable suggestion, really took some weight off me!

I made around 800euro profit. :) Going to spend it on a new workstation.

Installed the most recent Bitcoin Core version of the program. Says it'll take 145GB and 6 days to fully sync.
Although it seems like the password is the same, my funds aren't appearing in the new wallet. Oh boi, the tension is real.
Also just read that there's been a soft fork but hopefully I won't lose anything.
I'm uninstalling everything unneeded.
Is there any way to speed up the blockchain download process? I remember there was some way of P2P downloading a part of it on the old client.
Edit: Funds have appeared, 38 hours till it syncs completely. Hopefully I don't run out of space and the HDD doesn't break from old age.

That's a good idea! Thanks!
