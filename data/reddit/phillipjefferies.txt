Ah, I wish it were that easy. Unfortunately "unhealthy" when it comes to being a kidney donor can mean things like previous smoker, which I am. Also there's blood type issues.

Oh yeah, I mean we're on reddit so it comes with the territory. I'll pass on your regards :)
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:38:41
Totally, I was very naive to the process at first and I still am a bit. A lot goes into it for sure. I also fully expect reddit to give me shit so it's ok, it's part of the reddit experience ha

This is true. Once she gets a kidney it's not over. She'll be on powerful immune suppression drugs for quit a while that basically kill her immune system so that her body won't reject the kidney. Even then it's very common for recipients of a kidney to eventually need another one years down the road, it's brutal.

I'm not healthy enough, otherwise I would for sure!
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:24:49
Unfortunately that's not the case, it'd be easier if it were.  She had undiagnosed lupus that destroyed her kidneys and I'm just a regular guy who smoked and drank a bit in high school as most kids do, I'm mostly healthy though. Active job average fit body and good enough diet. You'd be surprised at how picky they are for a potential donor to be considered.  She's had other friends offer too, but they sadly also didn't qualify.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:40:14
She was in her 20s, hopefully that doesn't disqualify her from your acceptable list.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:03:58
She's definitely worth it, I offered unaware of the insane amount of requirements it takes to be a donor. She's had offers from friends and family too but it takes a very specific match to be a candidate. I had no idea. She's been on a list for 10 years!
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:27:32
She's been on a list for 10 years, she may just consider it lol I'll ask her.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:05:04
That would be some insane reddit magic if she got a kidney from a kind random redditor. I will pm you!
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:14:49
Oh no worries, I figured!  I hope she does too, she's awesome. And she takes her health very seriously, you have to maintain a healthy lifestyle just to stay on the candidate list. For example she got pneumonia last month and was taken off the list and now has to go through a battery of test to make sure she's still healthy enough for a kidney. She's not a drinker, smoker, or drug user and eats well. You've got to if you want to get someone's kidney ha

She's been on the list for 10 years and she just got her first call last month from a car crash victim. Unfortunately their kidney was too damaged and she didn't get the donation. But getting the call was very uplifting!
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:01:39
Lol I read her your comment and I guess she still loves me, we tried to warn her though. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:25:40
My girlfriend needs a kidney, but I don't have 9k

My apologies for not following every recent post to reddit at 2:45am my time. I was alerted by coinbase and the first thing I did was try and post it to as a heads up. What a nuisance to have multiple posts alerting people to pertinent information regarding their finances. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:24:59
Thank you! Would you happen to have any links to more specific information on this so I can educate myself further? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:00:03
OK, I reread the trezor page concerning the new addresses and they're calling them segwit adressess not segwit2x. So, segwit and segwit2x are different? And segwit is safe and the real bitcoin? No amount of research I do into bitcoin makes me feel confident in my knowledge of bitcoin lol thank you for answering questions for me. I've been hodling since around $700 but things have been getting so confusing lately. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:50:46
Wow, there is so much happening right now. I just want my money in bitcoin. Good old, original bitcoin. Until all this blows over I don't want to mess with anything else. I wish trezor was more clear on their intentions and reasons for setting me up with s2x wallet addresses instead of legacy ones. If people buy a trezor and don't realize they have s2x addresses they could be at risk of a replay attack and not know it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:47:28
I'm sorry, I got lazy with my wording. I am exclusively talking about segwit2x. Trezor has automatically transfered my coinbase bitcoins and litecoins to segwit2x addresses. Why would they do this if segwit2x were dead? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:05:35
Well, I just received the coinbase alert. Ive checked Reddit and coinbase within the past 12 hours and did not see this posted or talked about, specifically. Is there a reason why your being oppositional to the spread of useful information in such a volatile time for crypto? You don't need to answer that, my post was removed and this is a pointless conversation. I'll see myself out.
