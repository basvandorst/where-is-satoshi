I'd rather quit the business than resort to begging for charity.

That article was terribly argued, full of straw man arguments, gross over-simplifications, and wild claims without a shred of actual evidence to back them up. It certainly didn't provide the necessary reasoning or evidence to account for that click-baity title. I have no idea why Forbes has taken to publishing a bunch of shitty pro piracy op-eds by faux-hawked nineteen year olds lately...


I don't believe your charity-based dystopia is a forgone collusion. In my opinion the Balkanization of the Internet is inevitable and an effective regulatory regime will one day emerge. Historically speaking, the "wild west" stage has always been temporary. 


Assuming you're right about the future, I'd rather "die" (do something else) than continue to work as a second class citizen without any right to the products of my own labor.

Oh yeah? Well, where are they? Please show me all these *"innovative"* filmmakers you're talking about who are happily begging for charity and continuing to make films...
Professionals shouldn't have to rattle a tin fucking cup to get paid.

I don't know where you're getting you information from but it's completely wrong. Criminal provisions for copyright exist almost everywhere including the UK. See [section 107 (1)(c) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]( for reference.

There is literally zero evidence that TPB's founders ever stopped running the site and it's been a "profit oriented" business since the very beginning: 
According to one of the The Pirate Bay's own founders the site has been profitable since (at least) 2005 which was long before the cost-saving switch to magnet links:
* *"There's around 30,000-40,000kr flowing in per month. The cost of internet lines, server-hosting etc is less, so it [Pirate Bay] is already doing well, financially."* - [TPB founder Carl Lundstom in leaked email with an advertising broker](

Not according to the law.


That's because you don't know what you're talking about.

Again, there is literally no legal basis for your belief that property rights are predicated on scarcity. I don't know what else to tell you...


Comparing movies, novels, albums, video games to air and sunlight is beyond fucking stupid.

*  Supreme Court: 
*"Deliberate unlawful copying is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft."* - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v Grokster, Ltd (2005)
*  U.S Law Code:
Criminal infringement of a copyright is defined in Title 18, Chapter 113 under the heading **"Stolen Property.”**

Which is all well and good since ideas aren't covered under copyright...

And thieves didn't sign a contract with the corner grocer before they shoplifted a candybar. You don't need a contract when it comes to property rights as they are implicit and integral part of the social contract.

According to who exactly, exactly? Legal property is not predicated on scarcity.

Except there's no such thing as *"actual property rights"* and the highest courts in both the U.S and the E.U have affirmed copyright  legal property multiple times.


Happens all the time with tangible property. Buying land doesn't mean you have mining or logging rights to that land or that you can build whatever you want there, buying a firearm or a vehicle doesn't mean you can modify them however you want (etc). There are all sorts of limitations placed on physical property that you own. This notion of *"I bought it so I can do whatever I want with it it"* is overly simplistic (to put it politely).

Hurr durr laughing out loud about shit you know nothing about...
*  "When lawyer Ernst-Jan Louwers showed up in a Dutch court this week to defend the three Pirate Bay administrators, he swore that none of the three men in fact owned the site, having got rid of it in a shady 2006 transaction. How shady? Louwers told the judge that he could produce **literally no piece of evidence that the site had even been sold at all**—no contract, no bank transfer, no nothing." - [Arstechnica](

Who gets to decide that someone has an explicit "individual right" to physical property?
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:49:52


No one agreed to ANY specific property right. What's your point?
