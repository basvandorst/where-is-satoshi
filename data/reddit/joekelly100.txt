What if they already have it between them?

I agree, no threat from this today: it's fine for now because the inflationary block rewards mean that a mining cartel's best course of action is just to mine honestly — cash out the lion's share of $15m per day, or $5.5bn per year.
But the game isn't sustainable; it's a timebomb.
And it's really not that monumental: for context, the US military budget is $700 billion per year. 1% of it would do the job with lots of room to spare, using the dumbest method available to them of simply building a massive bank of chips. And Bitcoin is up against all governments, not just the US.

I was just using round numbers: obviously you could do the same thing with much less than $1bn. Or you could make it 100 bad guys, each doing 1000 transactions worth $10k.
The point is that, under trustless conditions, it's impossible to calculate the finality of your transaction simply by looking at its value and the 'weight' of proof-of-work that has accumulated. Number of confirmations is a weak indicator unless you know the potential scale of an attack you might be part of (which is unknowable).

You should wait for 100 confirmed blocks (by standard Bitcoin maths) if receiving a $10m transaction, 6 isn't enough.
$8k/BTC, 12.5BTC per block = $100k worth of proof-of-work per block.
The example given would be a 100 block re-org, which would cost $10m to execute, give or take. (Using round numbers to keep it simple — try to ignore the details, the point is supposed to be the economics around calculating finality of transactions).

No, they're not going to do something that dumb: there's no need. I was just pointing out that *even using the dumbest method available,* the sums involved are very far from 'monumental'.
Governments have much simpler, more efficient methods available to them: mining operations exist in the world of atoms, not bits, and they/their supply chains are not at all government-resistant: [
And it would be a permanent crash, not 2 years, since from then on it would be obvious that's how proof-of-work games inevitably unfold. I'm sure we'll still be able to buy drugs online though, since it's pointless trying to shut down smaller-scale operations, so it's not the end of the world for blockchains.

Block reward is an exponential decay, so there will be problems long before 2140. The price *must* double before the halving in May to maintain the *same* defensive strength.
If the price doesn't double, all of today's active miners will suddenly be chasing only $7.5 million per day / $2.75 billion per year with the same real-world operational costs.
As for fees never going away...
As a guy from the payments industry, I can tell you that transaction fees *are* going away as we speak. Banks, Visa, and MasterCard charging interchange fees is nothing but rent seeking — they've been fined billions in antitrust cases multiple times.
Banks should make money on net interest margin and that's it: there's no reason they should be charging stupid sums of money to customers just to make payments. And this is exactly the way the world is moving.
Bank-to-bank transfer protocols with no fees already exist today. It’s only a matter of time before these rails become a) ubiquitous, and b) the default rails for settling the vast majority of transactions in developed economies.
In other words, we know that zero-fee payment rails are how the vast majority of transactions are going to be settled in the near future, meaning they will not contribute to demand for Bitcoin transactions/block space.
No person or business is going to voluntarily incur an unnecessary cost per transaction if they don’t absolutely need to — and they don’t. So the idea that you can amortize insanely high base layer fees over 10-100,000x layer 2 transactions is therefore a red herring. Transactions over Lightning will always necessarily be more expensive because they must cover the security cost of the base blockchain.

Not if they already have it, or can seize it, or can organize a majority of hash power by any other method like sabotage, bribery, blackmail, or... or... or....
The point is Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless. That's the entire reason for using a proof-of-work blockchain in the first place. If we have to trust — if we have no way to verify — that the largest mining operators cannot ever become corrupted or compromised, and that they will never collude, that's bad.
If an attack would cause a crash in price, then we (all holders) are at constant risk of crash from 1 bad act. The ability to carry out this attack represents a dangling temptation, and while privacy is a good thing, a world of strong privacy makes hiding the spoils from such an attack much easier.

It would be nice if that were true; unfortunately it's not. Don't take it from me, take it from Nic Carter or Nick Szabo:

The key *non-*similarity is the relentless focus on satisfying a real world need in a cost-effective way. That's the thing he constantly mentions and brings everything back to.

Sure thing. This is mostly a comment on settlement assurances and the economics around re-org attacks.
Attackers would clear $990million worth of goods in the example given — they don't need to care about the value of their BTC collapsing as much as we normally think, though that is the risk they're taking.
In other words, they're risking $10m to potentially gain anywhere up to $1bn (and they're also risking everyone else's money in the process).
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:51:32
Yes, the potential crash in price is the risk being taken, but the point is 1) the shrinking of risk to $10m, and 2) the massive risk *transfer* onto everyone else:
In the example given, attackers clear $990million worth of goods so they don't need to care about the risk that the value of BTC crashes. In short, they're risking $10m to potentially gain up to $1bn (if it doesn't completely crash), and — in vintage 2008 style — it's mainly everyone else's money they're risking in the process.
All the examples and analysis I've seen, both in articles and economics papers, assume single transaction attacks, overlooking this "wide and shallow" strategy which 1) makes attack size undetectable, and 2) makes the cost of attack orders of magnitude smaller.
