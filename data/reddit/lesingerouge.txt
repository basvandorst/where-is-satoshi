Thank you very much for your detailed answer. Lots of information in there and some good leads to start further reading and exploring.
But I do feel that you only answered my first point. Do you have any opinion regarding 2 and 3?

While I am quite fond of the anarchic line of philosophies, I do not share the widely spread disgust of the state as an organisation.
In my mind, the current state of affairs with regard to human relations and organisation (in which the state quite obviously plays a major role) is simply a temporary model that came around in the evolutionary path towards something "better" (speaking from the point of view of evolution). So, basically, frogs are no more disgusting to me than cats. :)

All your ideas are good examples of possible applications, but maybe you have misunderstood my point (or I have explained it badly).
My point regards more the cultural and societal implications of such applications. What would happen to the world if decentralised voting was implemented? How could one start to think about implementing decentralised voting? How would the world change if you didn't have a fixed income but instead you had a "stream" of cash?

Well, let me put it this way: 
My line of questioning is more concerned with whether in a world organised by the principles built into the block chain, would "marriage" as an "organisation" still exist? If yes, how would that be formalised?
