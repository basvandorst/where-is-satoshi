While i agree with this 99% of the time - some alts are working on different use cases than bitcoin offers and have incredible teams. You shouldn’t underestimate the potential of some of their developments.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:00:33
Oh wow I completely misunderstood you sorry about that mate. To answer your question: if people are worried about tether, they aren’t worried JUST about tether. They are worried about the entire market because if tether fails then everything will crash. There’s (for the most part) only 2 people here. If you think tether will fail then u sell all ur crypto, if you think tether is fine then people will carry on as usual.
This is why we won’t see what you suggest in your question
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:08:17
Nice move buying some back! And great instinct you got there for predicting a crash haha. My remindme was not meant to be sarcastic or spiteful - it’s just for my own curiosity and for fun. I think it’s great that you sold to handle some priorities

Damn dude you got fucked 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:58:17
Let’s summarize here:
“Why do people say bcash a scam?”
“Because it’s purposely misleading. Ver claims bitcoin cash is real bitcoin”
“What? I’ve looked on google and haven’t seen that”
“Oh really? Here’s a link that quotes Rogor Ver doing exactly that”
“Oh yeah well he did say exactly that - but thats not what he meant though”
^ nice argument ?
Btw - If he actually meant something else by what he said, it only further proves my point that he is purposely misleading. So there’s that
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:10:36
Lmfao except Alice coin isn’t on this graph is it? These coins are traded 24/7 and are fairly priced by 1) supply and 2) demand of the market. Notice how “supply” is 1 of 2 factors that determine price. But multiplying price by supply is useless? Get a grip. 
I see this argument constantly and it highlights the scale of retards in this space. If you actually refuse to grasp the great point that this graph is making, you should put ur money back in the bank.

More worried about a 90% crash than paying some taxes on profits, but that is a valid reason to stay put and I see your point.
I also agree with your second point haha it feels insane to not have any money invested in crypto right now. Hopefully this resolved soon so I can buy back!

Tether failing will absolutely tank the market. Tether would only fail if it is found that it is not backed by USD (likely imo). The bitcoin price is heavily propped up by bitfinex printing tethers and buying bitcoin with it. If it is found out that all that price support is not legitimate, everyone will undoubtedly sell. People will also lose all faith in bitfinex and will likely cause a liquidity crisis when people try to get out of the exchange.
We are in very dangerous waters
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:46:07

That was my exact feeling since that article first came out. Something about the subpoena really spooked me though and I do have to admit that i had too much money in bitcoin to be comfortable losing. If bitfinex shows that tether is good, I’d be just as happy as if it burned to the ground. I just want some kind of resolve so I can come back!

Haha I was just thinking of this! Looks like a good decision for you so far :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:07:52
There is still room for other cryptocurrencies. Namely, iota and omisego. They have their own unique use-cases that will help the world in their own way. Ethereum isn’t going anywhere either
I’m sure there’s others, but those are the ones I can confidently speak on.
Bitcoin will always be the store of value in my opinion. Can’t wait for all these updates over the years. Should wash out a bunch of shitcoins :)

Doesn’t do what it’s supposed to eh? And how have p2p transactions been going for bitcoin? Just as planned, with double digit fees (USD)?
Or are u telling me that you invest in bitcoin not because of its current issues, but because of its future implications? Ohhh hmmm interesting wow yeah, never thought of that. 
Iota obviously has issues too. Fixes are underway. Doesn’t mean it’s a scam
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:55:15
Hahah don’t worry dude. It’s pretty obvious to me that you overdrafted on ACCIDENT rather than as a fucking investment strategy which many people here are accusing you of lmao. People are insane
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:13:12
That is simply untrue. While the cryptos I will mention are not currently “live” or fully developed.. OmiseGo has a completely different mission than bitcoin, and their SDK wallet will compliment the crypto space very well. It will help make crypto currencies much easier to accept for real world business. This is not something bitcoin is working on or is likely to implement. It will HELP bitcoin though.
IOTA, while very young and needs much more development, is also addressing a completely different market than bitcoin. If they are successful in implementing their fee-less transaction system, this will allow for a micropayment network with the potential of having autonomous entities making very small and instant transactions for minuscule purchases such as consumer data points. This is entirely different than bitcoins mission and again, NOT a competitor.
Idk why you think this space is “bitcoin vs alts”. MOST alts are definitely useless and bitcoin’s advancements will wipe them out. But other projects are probably here for the longrun and will co exist with bitcoin quite nicely.

@_date: 2018-01-24 14:35:06
This. Couple of buddies of mine talk about making a “blockchain company”. Personally I don’t get it. You’re either a crypto, or a business accepting crypto. Maybe crypto investment advising firm? I can’t see anything else really
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:31:29
Just because you are bitcoin purest doesn’t mean every other crypto in development is trash. Things take time to build, look at bitcoin after 9 years... still not even close to serving its use-cases in its current state.
I love bitcoin but to be all in on it is a bit silly in my opinion. I’ve been much less stressed since I’ve balanced my crypto portfolio with other exciting projects. I encourage you to do the same!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:07
Where is this audit?
And if they are dirty enough to collapse their own market on purpose then they are probably dirty enough to print tethers with no 1:1 USD ratio?
You’re saying “oh bitfinex are corrupt and lying to everyone for profit but only to collapse market and buy dip, def not counterfeit.” 
Like how could you possibly believe in one dirty trick and not the other?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:15:57
You clearly have never done any research on any other project besides bitcoin. I recommend that you do this before making ridiculous generalizations. 
And I’m assuming ethereum is also grouped into this statement about “alts”?? Lmao get real, seriously. There is amazing crypto technology being developed that has nothing to do with bitcoin

I like how if a transaction of mine doesn’t go smoothly, my bank can reverse the transaction if the merchant is being out of line about my refund. This to me, sounds trustless. I don’t need to trust the merchant because my bank can reverse transaction, worse come to worse.
Can anyone explain why this isn’t a massive issue with bitcoin? Or if maybe it’s been solved and I just can’t find the answer??
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:00:49
LN doesn’t need to be done for its value to start reflecting in price. Bitcoin would probably be nowhere near its current value if LN wasn’t in development. It’s anticipation will allow the price to continue to rise and when it launches... Jesus. Hold on tight 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:35:02
Click on that transaction. Don’t look at the “bought at” price. Calculate it yourself.
(1/x) * (y)
X = amount of bitcoin you own
Y = the total amount you invested 
This will give you the bitcoin price where your ROI becomes exactly 0.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:47:44
Do you really not see why it’s a bad idea?? How about you give us one good reason why you WOULD do a combined account? That is so complicated. Making ur own coinbase account takes about 2 minutes. There is not one reason to share an account. Don’t be retarded

I have a gaming computer that I’d love to put to use to mine some alts but there is no “sign-up and start mining now” type of program.

Is no one reading what I said? I never said anything about scaling well. I said it has scaling issues only because it has scale, unlike any other crypto. If another coin suddenly had bitcoins volume, it would have to survive everything bitcoin has already survived. People trust bitcoin because of what it has gone through and survived. 
I’m not trying to state anything other than what’s pretty obvious. To answer your question, I define success by survival and bitcoin has been through it all. Other coins have been through nothing in comparison.

You say “just transfer” as if bitcoin is free and instant and if banks/exchanges are free and instant. Why don’t u give it a shot and let us know what sort of set backs you encounter 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:10:36
Well, there has to be a buyer on the other end for you to sell to.
What you’re working towards here is how pump and dumps work though. People with a lot of money buy massive amounts of stocks / crypto at once, which makes the price rise. People see the price rise and think they can ride the wave up so they also begin purchasing. After the pumpers convince enough people to buy in because the price increase they created, they start selling it all off at a higher price than where they started. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:09:25
How would I use the 2-of-3 signature escrow with a third party arbiter? Does complicate things for the merchant?

So I know there’s other pages for this type of question... but there’s too much bitcoin hate on those pages for me to take their opinion seriously. 
As a person with huge faith in bitcoin, should there be other coins with projects worth investing in? I don’t like having all my eggs in one basket. I think after the next bitcoin price rally, I’ll spread my investment over Eth, ltc.. and maybe OMG as I find their project interesting.
Any other recommendations for a well balanced portfolio of cryptos??

“In order to have scaling issues, you need to have scale.”
This Andreas quote is why I am heavily invested in bitcoin compared to alts. Scaling issue to me means much more than txs and mempool. With scale comes government regulation, hacks, forks, media FUD, Wall Street... what other coin has faced these battles and won? None, because they don’t have scale. 
Bitcoin’s resilience is the reason I invest.

Try “cashing out” one exchange then cashing back in at another and let me know how many gains you miss while you’re stuck with USD for 2 weeks
If you’re smart you’d arb ltc/Btc rates since it’s fast to move around litecoin. The risk is that even a litecoin transfer will take around 30mins. A lot can happen in that 30 minutes. I made a few hundred bucks doing this but i had to use $10k to get those returns. it’s stressful as fuck and not worth it in my opinion

If people would just google this instead of Reddit rant it... problem solved. 
Anyone who googles “avoiding bitcoin fees” will know that there are exchanges that will pay your fees. GDAX prime example.
I see these posts everyday
