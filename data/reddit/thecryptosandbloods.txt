Presumably he is asking whether they will trade actual BTC or some form of cash-settled financial instrument - options, futures, whatever - like the CME futures. 
It's a fair question.

This is a good article. It's not because the guy was already rich from his finance career. It's because he explains the process by which a technology goes from being unknown, to being FUDded and described as impractical to taking over the world - he's actually summarizing an old Marc Andreessen op-ed, but still good. 
I always give the example of the Internet in 1995 but he mentions one more example I hadn't thought of - the personal computer in 1975-1980. 
Same process: early adopters and entrepreneurs and tech people say "this is revolutionary". The Establishment says "Nah, it'll never work" and lists a bunch of problems. 
The problems get solved, and suddenly the establishment races to get in and get involved and it goes mainstream and a new class of wealthy people are created from the early adopters. 
The Andreessen op-ed in 2014 says Bitcoin in 2014 is where the Internet was in 1993 or the PC in 1975 which I think was approximately right. 
In 2018, I think Bitcoin has moved on to about 1995-96 in Internet terms - the mainstream has at least heard the word "bitcoin" after the 2017 frenzy, but like the Net in 1995, people didn't trust it, didn't know what it meant and didn't understand its implications. 
Sort of like the PC in about 1980-1981 when the original IBM PC and MS-DOS were coming out but people had no idea what was about to hit them in the next few years.

Buffett's not stupid (far from it), he simply hasn't looked into bitcoin and crypto enough to understand the value proposition and he's responding to the mainstream media FUD he's heard about bitcoin: "Tulips, drugs, money laundering, energy waste, blah blah". 
If that's all I knew about bitcoin, I would think it was a scam too. 
He came around on tech stocks 20 years after saying he wouldn't invest in them (he waits for companies and sectors to become established) and he'll come around on bitcoin too in a decade - if he's alive anyway.
