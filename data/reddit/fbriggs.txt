You can as long as you follow the terms of the MIT license.

No, but you can look at the source by doing View-&gt;Developer-&gt;View Source in chrome. The whole thing is just the one file index.html. It will also need to have convnet-min.js in the same folder, but that's all for setting up dependencies.
It is MIT license, so fairly permissive as far as what you can do with the code.

I wrote this little toy in javascript to try to predict the future price of Bitcoin using deep learning. It grabs the last 30 days of price data from coindesk's API, then uses 1D regression to fit a curve through the data. The regression model is a 4 layer neural net trained with stochastic gradient descent, using the ConvNetJs framework. The graph is produced with Google Charts.
I would definitely not expect this to produce reliable predictions of future prices, because the model is too simple. It only uses previous price data, and no other indicators. Regardless, it is a fun experiment to see what can be done with a few hundred lines of code.

With this simple 1D regression model, it doesn't seem to do a very interesting job of predicting the future most of the time. If you press the randomize button a few times you may eventually get some results which predict a slight up or downward trend after the last data. However, continuing flat is also a reasonable solution as far as this neural net is concerned. In order to get more interesting predictions of future behavior, it would be necessary to use a different formulation, with more than 1 input to the net. I think something like looking at the last K days and trying to predict the change in price instead of absolute price would be a good next step, although still probably not enough.

What do you mean it died? That image looks like it produced something.

I haven't tried that yet, but it would be interesting.
