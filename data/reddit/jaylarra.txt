Same here. Probably lost around $400, too sad to check atm. I don't know why either since I plan to hold my crypto investment for at least 5 years. Shouldn't even bother trying to trade. Lesson learned!

Consider it the community thanking you for warning others. I certainly appreciate the heads and I'm sure others do as well.

Not quite the same but a decent read.  
A global injunction for trademark infringement against Google from Canada's Supreme Court...heh. 
On the topic of specifically suing Google for damages...I can only speak to Canada's laws but a suit in negligence against Google sounds plausible until you get to the standard of care. I mean, how much effort does Google have to put in to ensure people are not being scammed. I admittedly don't know too much about the tech side of search engines but I feel like ensuring every ad is not a scam would be a tall task and likely not a breach of the standard of care.
