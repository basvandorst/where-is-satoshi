This is the first wallet I've been genuinely excited to use.
Beautiful interface and impressive security/authentication. I would love the ability to use a Yubikey as my two-factor.
The unit denomination does however keep resetting to BTC upon logging in and out.

I was shopping for some EL wire for a recent festival. I stumbled across  and when I was checking out I saw the option to pay with bitcoin. 
Ended up having a little email conversation with the store owner about Bitcoin!

 I've not reviewed their fees recently but it was somewhere in that realm when I sold my sofa not long ago.

No, credit goes to Robert Hesse of Smartwatch+ 
My girlfriend wasn't interested so I thought I'd share it with you guys!

Nothing but good things to say about snapCard.
I ordered a pebble watch through SC direct from pebble, the order still hadn't arrived two weeks later (US to UK) and so a quick message to Michael and he sorted it out. He apologized then proceeded to order me another pebble from an Amazon UK retailer, for nearly twice the original cost.
This is, in my opinion, above and beyond.

SnapCard has allowed me to by all sorts of things on t'internet over the last few weeks.
I've simply not come across better customer service either.
I ordered a Pebble watch a week or two back from the US and Pebble have yet to ship my order. A quick message to SC and they reordered the watch from Amazon UK (from an independent retailer) at completely their own cost, which turned out to be almost double the ($) cost of my original order, just to make sure I received it in time for Christmas.
I cannot praise this company enough.

Seems there is something similar. This post is from 7 months ago!
