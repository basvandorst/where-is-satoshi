I had this happen to me with Paysera. Called them they refused saying they will *never* have their banks be used to purchase btc. Inb4 a month ago they started an ico.

Don't forget that you can't withdraw your money if you are using Mastercard.

Okay then.

It would be ONLY IF people stop mining. And the only way to make people quit is if it is not economically viable. Do you understand what Im trying to say? Its like inflation, you want a constand increase in difficulty and a lowering in btc mined to have a stable currency.

Excuse me, but what is mtgox? Im from a couple of years here. Im sorry.

At this point you are just piecing things up. Exactly the fact that people stopping would not be beneficial for anyone. I mine bitcoin and I can tell you that if it drops below 300 usd, nobody in their right mind would sell it for that. Thats like producing pickles and selling them for 10 cents a jar. Nobody would do that other than people who have stacks of pickles and that would be for a limited time only. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:36:11
Nobody would actually mine it...
@_date: 2017-01-08 09:55:10
Well,yes? Im just trying to say its a bad thing people jumping ship.

This. I have invested more than 20k in miners and choose to read every or post or news with a boat load of salt. I just chose "I don't care" in the pool and keep on mining just like the 99% of the people there. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:07:05
Why would they? At 300$ a bitcoin and today's difficulty you would be making less than your power bill.

I once got my money in my bank account 10 minutes after clicking withdraw. Honestly, for getting my money safely to me, I'd prefer CB.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:00:42
Are you fo' real?
@_date: 2019-06-13 12:35:40
Because they won't know what it is. And still get lobbied by normal bank transfers.
