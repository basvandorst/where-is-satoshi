It's just $2 to open and $2 to close and then I can buy a sandwich, right?

Can't wait to spend $2 in fees on an $8 sandwich.

This is so sad.  We used to be able to send BTC for a penny or less.  We made fun of services that took hours and charged $.99 or more for a transaction.  We praised BTC's ease of use.  We pushed for adoption, not "hodling".
Now people are saying we should send it for $.50 or so and just wait a day so your off-chain channel is setup.  Who's teaching vendors who just want to focus on their business how to setup a lightning channel for my one-off purchase?

If Bitcoin is trying to be money, money is about making it easy to spend, not just sitting on it because the fees are too high to be useful for buying a cup of coffee.  Those who've been around long enough remember when fees were a penny or less.  People were all about spending, and adoption, not lambos and hodling.

He didn't say the first statement.  You're quoting me and saying he said that.  Fees have killed Bitcoin as a currency. In the beginning it, it was all about trying to get people to adopt Bitcoin, now it's telling people that they can buy a lambo if they hold on to it and don't spend it.  If you do spend it, you are looking at $2, or maybe $40 if the network is busy (2017).
That's why I said it's not a currency anymore.

New Bitcoin isn't a crypto currency... It's a crypto asset.  Been a couple years since it was useful as a currency.  Now it's all just speculation.
