I don't very many people actually worry about bitcoin eating their cake like that. 
Bitcoin is so tiny that it hardly touches anything yet. It's like worring about the internet killing your business in the early 90s. Which means it might, but if you already worry about that you are way ahead of the curve.

I think it's more accurate to say that Core doesnt have "consenus". Not activating segwit is a vote of mistrust against Core rather than something to do with the segwit code. 
Had segwit come before the scaling debate it would probably have been activated right away. 
At least that's what I see in the debate.

@_date: 2017-03-18 10:32:24
That's not really how decisions are made. No one calls the shots. And just because someone vots with hashpower doens't mean the community will follow, so it's not really the end of anything. Probably the opposite

Segwit is not one thing, it mixes malleability and with a genius stroke it also allows for up to 4mb blocks. You bolding it doens't make it what you think it is. It is the code.
And there is no such thing as "long term scaling" provided by anyone. Raising the block size is not scaling. If it were, bitcoin in 2009 had better scaling than bitcoin 2017. The issue is so much more delicate and compliacated.
But fortunatly the devs are working very hard to achive better scaling. MAST, Schorrr, LN e.tc. are all in the works, but we cant even get the first step activated, becuase miners are afraid that scaling better will reduce their fees.

No, you arent. If time was the thing you traded there would be no such thing as division of labour. the time is incidental to the work you are trading. If you could make time stop, but still have ppl affecting your surroundings trade would not stop. Thus, its not time you are trading. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:17:59
They don't though. All the experts on the subject us against it. 
If somehow, all the most knowledgable guys changes their mind, it would be worth looking in to it. But they won't. Few, if any, think "emergant consenus" is a good idea.
It would be fun if they added emergant consenus on inflation, block time, etc. It's just more decentalisation! No reason not to add it. Why let a cabal of blockstreamers choose the inflationrate? Miners and users should as they are incentiviced to do whats best of the ecosystem 
But I really really hope now that BU actually fork so this idea can live or die on its own and we dont have to ever talk about it again.

"A 2MB hardfork that fixes malleability, or any other proposal that could be backed up by a huge majority could end this war."
It's hade been made abundanlty clear that this is not interresting if Core does it. I see absolutley no evidence that there is any proposal that can unite.
Over the last years it has been made clear that we can't all agree on a proposal. You can't have both a blocksize limit and not have one. You can both have Core, and not have them.
"If your job were to make a proposal that you honestly think everyone would agree on, even if its not the perfect one, what would you propose?"
I don't have one. No one has one and I don't think one will come either. 
"If not, hardfork, hate, and well kill the chicken that lays golden eggs. "
If BU for example forks away from the network that's fine with me. It may have to come to this. Although I doubt it. I think BU is dead after this ludacris display of incompetency.

It's a religion and that makes the leaders like Ver priests, who by virtue of knowing the gospel even more infallible.

@_date: 2017-03-16 07:27:43
In practice, what they achive, is so similar is silly to make distinction. 
But there is no reason to think that a 2mb hardfork would fix anything. Bitcoin Classic got support in that camp for offering a 2mb fork. This was no longer interresting  when Core offered it via softfork and instead they wanted BU.
The hardfork side have made it very clear that Core is the problem,  and their vision for bitcoin is what needs to be forked away from. So, I don't really see the point in forking for that sake. It wouldn't happen anyway, as the argument is that any centrally planned blocksize is bad and the "market" needs to decide the limit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:09:38
Their US stratum is not BU yet. So no
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:59:35
Assuming the fork happens I will dump 100% of my holdings on the BU-chain no matter the user/hash-support. 
I have zero trust for the developers there. The code they run are just beyond bad and obviously completly untested which shows a complete disregard for the process. 
And the fact that a miner wants not only to fork to a chain based on this code, but do it while 90%+ of the nodes are incompatible, 99% of the developers think its a bad idea and HE wants to ACCELERATE the hardfork under these conditions.
If that happens and even gains traction thats fine, but I dont want to be part of it. to me its so dumb i could just as well be on some retarded chain like dash or etherum or some stupid scam like that. Maybe just wait for MimbleWimble and hope that turns out better, but either way, no BU for me.

Dont worry. Let people play games. If he forks the network against the will of the community he's done. It's a nobrainer. His only leverage is fear, and fear will only exist in the anticipation of an event. Once it happens it just happens and you deal with it.
Jihan studied psychology at university. He knows this. He wants to strike fear in the heart of the community so he can have power at a protocol level, he doesnt want to strike at it directly because he will strike himaelf out and then be ignored. It can only happen once. Nothing will come of it, so dont worry. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:14:58
It has got to be somewhat valuable, right? Even gold needs to move.
If btc was capable of doing only 1tx per day, it would be quite unusable. Only 300 people could transact with it per year.
Now, I'm not sure where the line is, and it's quite possible that 3tx/sec is fine for now, but at some point it wont be. How do we calculate this? If we can keep it decentralized I see no reason not increase blocksize with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:09:44

"Nothing changes until something changes."
You are  not stupid so you understand the hole in your narrative here. If you want to critque segwit that's totally fine, but then you need to adjust the narrative you sell so you dont contradict your own critique in the same senta ce.
BU exists so there can be bigger blocks and that pushes nodes that dont support bigger blocks off that network.
So even you were correct, and segwit were to push non-segwit ready nodes off the network, that would be a lot fewer nodes pushed off the network than if BU mined a larger block.

1) it's an open protocol. Like http. Anyone can write compatible software that is compatible with the network. There are many compatible clients, but BU wants to change the rules for the protocol, but it cant, unless supported by the miners and even then it will be forked off the network and nodes with the old rules will ignore it.
2) no, they are not rogue devs. They haven't contributed with any code to bitcoin before they started Bu

The people on "that side", feels very deminished and spat on. For every attempt to raise the blocksize they have been shut further och further away from the center of the community and that makes the attempts be crazier and crazier. I don't think most of them really want EC or the current BU devs. They just want change and be listend to. Sort of like Trump supporters or whatever. It's not so much about the candidate, it's more about sending a message.

No one is against non-contentious hardforks when that's the only way forward. 100% of the users on the "corechain" will want that chain to survive so a hardfork will deployed right away and work smooth just like when the coin bug happend.

So you bought into this conspiracy theory huh
 
2) its open source. Whoever can run it. They are paying for it AND giving it away. You think they will magically use it to kill the safety of the network AND at the same time make money?
Can you show the math for that please? 
3) 2nd layers are already where most activity happen. Coinbase, exhacnges, inhouse payments, dice-sites etc Thats a good thing. It's how we scale. Everyone wants this including miners. And yes they want LN aswell. So we can get a billion ppl in on this
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:50:31
Well it really is a conspiracy theory because it lack facts and assumes a conspiracy. That, depsite what everone says, including every contributer to core (most whom aren't employed by blockstream), blockstream somehow rules over core. (In fact, only 1.5 ppl are full time on core. And lots or other companies employ core devs)
See how you assume that blockstream signs an agreement, the ageeement isn't held because it's rejected by core, for you that just reenforces the conspiracy. That's the essance of a conspiracy theory, it's non falsifiable. Everything you see you will see as further proof that blockstream rules. When they sign an agreement that isn't upheld it's just further proof that they are so mighty that they can silence every other core delevloper.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:45:01
We are not in pain. The fact that blocks are full and people are willing shows that the system is so great that people want to use it despite it being sometimes slow and, by some measurements, expensive.
But in order to keep that system running we need to stay within limits. Decentralised systems doesnt scale great and that sucks, but that doesnt meant you sacrifice the system to get it more efficient. 
Now, core has offered a great scaling opportunity with segwit that could be running in 2 weeks. But people dont want it, so we wait. And we dont let opportunits and altcoin-pumpers ruin the system for short term profit. This is a marathon, and we need bitcoin running for decades ahead. 
If this can be called pain, we dont cut off our head so we dont have to feel it.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:04:30

Bitcoin Investment Proposal........
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:05:26
Maybe thats the way blockchains will work. Speculators will play a zero sum game betting on a blockchain and users will just minimize the time they hold it. They may collapse like ponzies when the value move to new chain. Most are here to get rich, so if they feel they have a better shot on another chain the ecosystem might not need that much time to recouperate. 
If a chain is that much better it might just make sense to leave to old behind. A 14 billion asset is not really big thing in the scheme of things
Most ppl dont intend to trust the blockchain for years, the industry moves way to fast in order to say that we are in any way certain to trust bitcoin for ten years ahead, but that doesnt stop it from being used

What upsides does btc have compared to MW? I'm honestly asking, bc im not super familiar with MW yet.

The believer always thinks he's the one who has seen the truth and others are just are blind, despite not having any credibility of the subject. See how you use other peoples opinions, instead of science, on the matter as authority (like the weather channel guy, who is as good as an authority of climate change as I am on the block size),yet accuse others of being reliant on authoriets, instead of looking at the science.
Now, you may resume the regular talking points how everyone is a sheeple and the thousands of scientists who actually work are so duped and know nothing. Your superious knowledge about the climate would of course crush them in a debate. It there anything a libertarian conspiracy theoriest isn't an expert on?

THey  CANT own lignthing no matter the businessplan. A lot of compaines in the space was funded without business plans. Be thankful VC were dumb/kine enugh to torch their money. See 21.
However, a company like blockstream might give huge returns on your bitcoin by making the protocol much better, and actually making btc a viable option long term. So betting on blockstream was probably a long term bet on the value of btc for most investors

The question was what "Gavin  ... had been up to recently". I answered that he hadn't done anything codewise afaik.
"Before they quit, development on bitcoin was moving in a good trajectory and they did lots of smart things"
Anything particular you had in mind?
"Since then things haven't been progressing nearly as well as they used to, so I'm using my deductive reasoning."
The market cap since they left have increased what.. 10x combined to the market cap when they were here? So the combined value they created in the time they were here was much smaller than after the time they left according to the market.

If the exchange rate never changed it would be a zero because that's how it started and you'd have the same amount of security. If the value was constant so would the security and it would be trivally attacked. Also, that's just not how value work. It can never stay fixed becuase that now how the universe works, ever.
If you want something that bitcoin isnt and can never be Im not sure why you are interrested in bitcoin. 
Also, your post smell a little dishonest when you write that you dont want to invest but " Also as a (young) academic I don't really have any spare cash laying around to invest.". That wouldn't be an issue if you didnt want to invest. Sounds a little more like a non-buyers remorse if you been in it for 5 years and could have easly retired for a trivial amount of money invested at that time.

That's not evidence and you know it. Provide evidence that blockstream policy has somehow changed the direction of the protocol contrary to what had otherwise been produced. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:40:01
The BU and many "big blockers" believe there is a conspiracy by a company called Blockstream that influnces Bitcoin Core to keep the blocksize down in order to somehow later profit from this. Like many conspiracy theories its very vague and non falseifyable.
And the parameter to regulate the blocksize is called "max_block_size" in Bitcoin Core, but they renamed it blockstream core whatever to be really antagonazing or something.

I upvoted. It's the question asked. I don't mind all sides getting heard, but we also need to adress what's being said.
The first one is an obvious political play. That person says:


The wording is so ridiclous. Bitcoin Core has never made an agreement with anyone. And he says it like he always knew this was bad code, but kept it to himself instead of making it public. Very disingenuous and makes me really doubt that person.
Also, I can not see his name on the hong kong agreement at all. Where on that agreement is he?
The other piece is also political. The person writing it doens't have a problem with the code but is angry because "he invested money" and feels he should be richer. Statements like "Bitcoin Core took this amazing thing called Bitcoin and has run it into the ground". BEYOND ridicilous. Everyone knows Bitcoin Core is largly resonsbile for making a success thus far. 


They never said that or anything like it. Instead, they produced a very thoughful list of pros and cons 
Maybe if the supposed alternatives could be honest with what the


Back in conspiracy land. You can't argue with that because a conspiracy is by nature unfalseifiable. Honestly, anyone who speaks english can go on the bitcoin core slack channel and talk to f-ing CEO of Blockstream. He's online there every day and talks openly to everyone. You should try. Not very many CEOs are that available.


Only miners can produce this? Why don't the miners produce the great code then, if they are the only ones qualified to do so. You can't take this angry ranting serious.

@_date: 2017-04-05 15:52:20
It's not. A direct attack that you can is very easy to prevent and everyone gets on board. The whole community would hardfork as fast as when the coinbug was discovered and the whole effort, that would take years to mount btw, would be dead in a week. The time after dead we would be better prepared and it would be dead in a day
It would be the worst way ever to attack bitcoin.

Agree. It's quite interresting to follow this. I don't believe the "this is cheating" narrative. 
I don't think cheating is a good term, and it would be pointless if it was. No one is here to play by the rules, we invent new rules. But breaking SHA256 isn't cheating either. Or a government getting 100% of the hashpower and just mining accepted TXs. That's just part of the rules that the protocol allows, but it doesn't mean we have to take.
Part of the freedom is also to change it without making excuses to anyone. If the miner can't handle it, well it sucks to be them. Just as it sucks to be us if they don't want to activate something like segwit and we don't do shit about it.

Stop caring. Bitmain is just using covert means to win the hashing war. Now we know and can adjust. 
I just want to avoid the "morals" and "rules", narrative. This is bad because it goes against what I want bitcoin to be, but it's perfectly allowed to "play dirty". It's also allowed to break SHA256 or just mine some TXs, but we don't have to take it.
Run the rules you want to be enforced
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:52:08
I agree with your. It's not cheating and its quite pointess if it was, we don't really have judges that can tell him to stop it.
The thing is, someone can come up with an optimization that breaks SHA256 and then you mine all blocks instantly it's still the same things. Just an optimization. You are allowed do to this. 
What do we do then? Just let bitcoin die? It will be the longest chain for sure, but it will have no security and a single point of failure. No. You tell them to fuck off, fork and them deal with it. You don't have to play their game. This is in opt in system, and if you don't like what they do, you change the rules. If enugh value wants to change the rules, we now how new rules.
Neither is fair/unfair, its just how the game is played. They look out for their interrests and you look out for yours.
The rule used to be that you cant have private currency. Bitcoin came up with new rules, and nodes are used to enforce them.

I don't. People are angry becuase riling up emotions get people in the mood to defend against this changes to the protocol which people think will destroy the value of the network they support.
It's rational for Nestle to drain the wells in certain areas, but people get mad that they do it because it deprives the local population of a water source. So I guess its natural to get angry even if they other part is acting rational to support their own interrest if you see my point.

Pretty insane to be how a strategy to win others players money in the market can be called manipulation. I mean, that's what everyone is trying to do, so how is this different that relying on charts or any other "strategy" that is supposed to make you money in the market.

Broken key technical support levels
"Bitcoin had previously found support at its 50 day moving average three times in the past year (the blue line on the chart below). It blew past the 50 day moving average in mid-January and then the 100 day moving average of $9,219 on Thursday (the red line)."
Translation: It corralated somehow with an arbitrary choosen number that is picked for the very reason it corralated with it for some time. This is no longer the case, and bitcoin now corralates with one less number. This is somehow related to the performance of the price for unexplainable reasons.
"If Bitcoin can’t sustain $9,000 it could lead to additional selling pressure as people who had made money buying it before December decide to take their profits or anyone who bought it after December 1 are underwater. They may decide to cut their losses and sell. Either way it could get ugly."
If bitcoin goes under 9000$ it may also go down to another number. If this happens, I speculate that other people will sell and buy this bitcoin at a price lower than 9000$. This is not good for the people who bought at a higher price. I get paid for these insights.
"One of the challenges with trading, and to a degree investing in, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they trade 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Since they are so volatile trying to keep abreast on what is impacting their price is extremely difficult and probably very stressful."
People who stress about trading now stresses even more because of increased trading time. This is unrelated to everything.

segwit is a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:24:00
What do you mean? It's obvious that they dont support the best technical solution. They say so themselves. 
Do you think 2mb hardfork is a better TECHNICAL solution? No, neither do they
The discussion have been had for 3-4 years. Do you think they will suddenly change their mind with more discussion? We can be civil and all, but dont kid yourself that we still talk about tech here
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:06:45
is alive and well
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:43:45
That wasnt the proof that was asked for. The proof that was asked for was that UASF is based on astroturfing. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:07:50
I asked for evidence. Not senses aka feelings
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:30:58
Sure. That's why segwit was branded a disaster, big blockers ran BU and NO ONE signaled for 2MB+segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:51:44
Much better than his idea to turn garbage into jail time. Best of luck to you
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:56:17
No point in talking technical arguments when one side isnt after the best technical solution. That one has already been available for a long time.
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:19:27
Asking for evidence is the opposite of feelings, but nice try. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:03:25
For all we know Bitcoin was invented by a woman. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:41:38
I have followed the discussion for a very long time so I understand their position clearly. They have stated over and over again that this is no longer about tech. This is about core. 
They could not have made their position very clear.
So, in light of that it's pointless to talk tech. We can talk core, we can talk alternative implemenations, we can talk Jihan Wu not wanting change, but if you seriously think they they are running something like BU because of technical merits you aren't listening to what they are saying and THEN YOU DONT UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION. 
So don't tell me I dont listen to the opposition. I hear them loud and clear. 
Is roger ver making technical arguments? No. He doesn't try to. Jihan Wu doens't bother to read the BIP. Is he making technical arugments? No, he doens't try to. ViaBTC says they didnt even read segwit. Are they then making techincal arguments?
THERE IS NO OTHER SIDE TO ENGAGE WITH ON TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS. DO YOU SEE THEM ON THE MAILING LISTS? DO YOU SEE THEM MAKINGS BIP ANYWHERE? DO YOU SEE THEM ENGAGE THE DEVS?!?!?!?!?!?!?
THERE IS NO ARENA WHERE THEY ENGAGE IN TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS. SO HOW THE FUCK DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT THIS IS TECHANICAL DEBATE 2017
there we go.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:17:27
It's not only them? Maybe. But without those who I think segwit would already be activated. The fact that that camp is so small that we can name names easily show what a little group it is. No one can seriously think that without jihan/bitmain we would anywhere near the shit we are in here.
How are they are "pushed out?". That's not how Gavin saw it, and Mike was hardly pushed out. He pushed himself out and cried in the media because he didnt get his way. The only people seem to think they were pushed out seem to be other people who watch from afar.
What other dev was pushed out(what does that even mean? they are free to come up with any proposal. the fact that it isn't accepted doenst mean that you are pushed out. most proposals arent accpeted)
Show me the messages that were deleted and we can ge the judge. You ofc wont see policits in your own posts same as i dont see it in mine. 
If everyone leaves the arena because they dont get their way that's up to them, but then you leave the debate, and it's no longer a technical debate. 
It's up to them to come up with a better proposal. Small blockers will not do it for them,
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:16:47
So you agree that it as the moment have nothing to do with Core. 
If new ideas spread, gain support and people change their mind on it so ofc anything can happen. EC can be part of Core. 100mb blocks can be part of core. It isn't now. Just like BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:10:32
No they haven't. No one has any idea what the NY agreement entails codewise. Which is ofc why it was so easy for them to sign, they knew they didn't make a commitment to anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:52:43
Show how Core, the reference software, has anything to with BIP148. It's not supported in the software.
@_date: 2017-05-03 07:33:13
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:56:48
I dont think a lot of people think that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:07:51
Can't upvote this enugh!
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:39:08
So now everyone owes them their loyalty forever? Even if they start to threaten the decentralized nature if the network?
Who cares if they helped grew the network. So did Roger Ver. 
Cant even ask them for evidence that UASF is an astroturfing campaing without you thinking this is an attack on Bitpay? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:07:23
So why are you saying it has something to do with core?
People who develop for core != core. Everyone has their own opinion and some push it. It's like saying that core has something to do with roman catholism because one of the members (probably more, but you get the point) is a christian.

Not a thing. Might be in the future, but no real focus from anyone on that. It's largly the same devs as BU, so its just gonna be the same supporters aswell.
It will probably gather some attention after the segwit2x resolves itself. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:00:04
You are not refeering to technial debate. Show me the bips Jihan wants imporved. show me what viabtc wants improved from the mailing list.
If you want to think this is a technical debate. Dont show me twitter posts or reddit. Show me the actual debate where they engage the devs on the mailing lists, show me where the research they do, show me the code the produce. Then we can debate the tech

Dont forget bip149. Segwit2x and btc1 is the same tho. Btc1 is the repository for the segwit2x code.
There is really only three "active" proposals at the moment. Segwit regular, Segwit2x and bip148.

When the hardfork occurs you have coins on both forks. Just move the coins to an exchange that accepts the side you think will fail and sell them there

No one knows. We have to wait for a real market. I think ViaBTC have a futures market so you can check there.

I think they have stated that they will fork regardless of outcome. I see no problem with this. They are not competing with the name bitcoin. Its an altcoin with premine.

It’s just that if you understand money you understand there is no use for more than one kind. The best and hardest money rises to the top in a free market. Bitcoin is that money. 
The only reason to own an altcoin is if that would be better money than btc. But as long as bitcoin has proof of work and limited supply this is very unlikely to be the case. So every coin thats is either smaller (that means less network effect which means less usecase), has worse montary policy (not a fixed supply) or isn’t hard (means it can be produced easier (such as a central bank pritint it with 0 effort). This includes all known currencies in the world, fiat or non fiat.

@_date: 2017-06-14 07:40:20
1) it changes how bitcoin is improved. Instead of BIPs and open review it's made with backroom deals where you sign agreements before code is even written. It sets a horrible president
2) they repetedly ignored warnings on how to activate the code
3) they want to hardfork for the sake of hardforking. There are tons of shit you want when you eventually hardfork. (Google hrdfork wishlist) just making a hardfork for the sake of horsetrading is stupid and dangerous. 
4) its incredible rushed. Releasing new, incompatible code, with only a month of testing is stupid and risky. 
5)compromise is stupid. If miners want kyc and aml for the network. Do you compromise and give them kyc? No, you go for the option you want. Now everyone gets the worst of all worlds. Segwit was largly developed to avoid hardforks. Had we known it was going to be a hardfork it would not be developed like this. So why run this code if you arent going to use it for its purpose? This shows clearly that this is a political deal, not made for running good code. 
6) it has no developers. So far every commit is by jeff garzic and afaik no other dev have commit to work on it after the release. Nothing is planned. All rushed together
