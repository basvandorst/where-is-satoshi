I can see them nipping down tesco's with a router connected to a car battery only to be hit with 30 minute wait times and $30 transfer fees

Oh shit, time to get out.

More like coinbase and bitpanda
Those 4 you listed aren't regulated

Very bad timing

Gold is heading up and bitcoin is heading down 
This couldn’t be worse timing
Bitcoin is not low, that was at 3k

Not dead yet
It has a use case, but the process of becoming a butterfly from a caterpillar looks unlikely
With the issues bitcoin has, I'm surprised it's still at 10k - personally, I think it's well over valued right now and I'd sell it.

The biggest lie some bitcoin holders  tell themselves is that there can only ever be shitcoins after bitcoin.
innovation is not  impossible, it's highly likely based off of history

bitcoin is nothing like the internet - terrible comparison
Bitcoin doesn't know what it is, because each time it thinks it has a use case, it fails at that use case.
Bitcoin  isn't any good for day to day shopping/payments because transactions fees are too high and the network cloggs up 
lightning network isn't looking to good and has created new problems.
Bitcoin isn't designed to be a store of value, it was a side effect that won't last forever as it was meant to become inflationary  over time just like fiat money, so Gold still holds that crown.
The only thing bitcoin is good for is a low adoption form of peer to peer cash that you can move and protect - other crypto's can also do this so it doesn't make bitcoin special 
The miners don't want to change anything so innovation isn't likely to happen, they are also becoming more centralized as time goes on.
Pow, pos don't have me convinced - consensus needs a lot of work -  if there's a chance something can be exploited for cash then there will always be people looking to exploit that weakness.
Then the governments might step in and try to gain taxes on mining and staking - they can shut down big mining companies that don't agree to pay taxes - that means some countries can gain an advantage. They could also force manufacturers to prevent mining on normal tech equipment which could make it harder for the average miner - All of this could damage bitcoin.
Another barrier is law, if bitcoin is banned then don't expect to be able to spend it on goods in the countries market place as nobody will accept it
The fact 60% of hashrate comes from china isn't great either.
Bitcoin is far from the proven solution, it's just a first step
