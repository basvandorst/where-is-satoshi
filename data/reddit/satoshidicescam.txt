The coins never got credited, which means they cant be stolen. I first accesed the site through proxy with https in front, which it gives me automatic, so the connection was secure from the get go. After the coins not being credited, i thought maybe the browser was flukey, thats why i changed and used the regular browser.
My second deposit arrived normally, with no delay. The first deposit, 18.5BTC never got credited, so i **CANT** accept the logic of them being stolen.
something I never possesed, or got credited **CANT** be stolen!! I need you to understand that. My account is still intact with change in it, which means my account cant be compromised.
How can something I never had be stolen from me? Its not possible for the thief to even steal the money, because your logs even confirm my rejected withdrawels...
so how can I have rejected withdrawel when in fact the coins was in my account?
you can follow the time-line of my rejected withdrawels and cross-elimate with the balance, if my balance was "correct" then the withdrawels would not be rejected right?

Satoshi is down, looks like my complaint either made them aware, or it holds a lot of merit

Both me and Satoshi have agreed, the coins was sent correctly, the issue is the account never got the coins credited, another deposit was made to the same address and it appeared like normal..
But not the first one, the one that came from many outputs, which I think is the reason for the issue, however, instead of fixing it and crediting my account, they straight stole my coins and claimed I withdrew them, which is not possible because the coins never got credited.

thank you for your mature response.

The biggest issue, is the coins never got credited, so its impossible for someone to steal something that NEVER got credited?  can you please let me know if my logic is fucked up or?
Blockchain, showed the coins was received, but Satoshi never credited it. I know no one have stolen my coins any other then Satoshi, because its only me and Satoshi who possess the abillity to withdraw the coins and I know I haven't withdrawn them.
Something I never had can't be stolen, thats the whole point. and Satoshi is fucking me and they KNOW IT! thats why all the lame and not possible excuses have been given, when I ask the real questions, I get ignored..
I made my first deposit through many outputs, thats why they did not credit as usual, I have been trying to tell them that, that all the transactions is their internal wallet, but they won't do anything, because they want ALL MY MONEY! and possible yours as well, if you are unlucky as me

This happened last Saturday, I emailed their support and the bitcointalk thread on Sunday morning(last week)
I would have given Satoshi more time to sort this out, however, another user on the bitcointalk thread claims to have the same issue as me and he have been waiting 4 weeks, 4 emails and still no response.
I made this thread because I slightly feel ignored aswell. If support cant resolve email inqueries within a week, time-frame wise, then thats another issue with Satoshi.
