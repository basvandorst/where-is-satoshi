Actually bitcoin is getting more adoption in countries with hyperinflation like:
Venezuela 40,000 % inflation rate  
Zimbabwe  (no info)
Turkey 11.9
Iran 82.7
Argentina 31% inflation rate
This means that people see Bitcoin as a store of value like gold.
Somebody could say that it is volatile. 
Compared to Fiat it has more Value every year. If you see the bitcoin chart from 2009 to the present it is in constant rise.
So despite the volatility it is profitable.
Also according to a survey done by ING, Turkey is the top country with percentage of people holding crypto.

ETF s were rejected because of :
1- Lack of trusted price formation and  2-Reliance on futures markets and derivatives
 Bakkt satisfies both requirements , as they said, theywill no offer leverage on their platform and bitcoin traded on Bakkt will be fully collateralized or pre-funded

Bitmex making legs up an down liquidating longs and shorts all the same time
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:21:21
That is true.
Futures killed bitcoin. Practically they bet against bitcoin price without having to hold real bitcoin so they do not create demand.
Also trading derivaties they can create all the liquidity they want,
If this worked suppressing the gold price of course will work suppressing bitcoin price too.
A physical ETF would be a good thing for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:19:15
Of course it is going to the sellers pocket. But sellers are part of the market. The market is where buyers and sellers actually meet and commit to trade.
@_date: 2018-09-29 23:15:16
I will just hold
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:42:39
 Reliable price because Bakkt will offer no leverage and bitcoin future contracts with physical bitcoins.  
Just an example: Gold  derivatives  market is many times bigger than the real gold supply.
This causes price suppression increasing the supply artificially.

Sure they do. Since CME and CBOE launched in December 2018 price has been constantly suppressed. Derivatives have done and still doing the same thing with gold prices. The derivatives gold market is many times bigger than the real gold market.

When Bakkt was announced most of the crypto enthusiasts thought, finally a regulated product that will bring institutions into the bitcoin game with physical bitcoin, unlike the CMEs paper bitcoin.
But a researcher did not find a way for a trader to get their bitcoins out of Bakkt, suggesting that Bakkt works only in one way. **You can deposit BTC but you can only withdraw USD from Bakkt**.
If somebody has any proof that a trader can withdraw bitcoin from Bakkt please post it in this thread.

Big bitcoin miners have large amounts to sell and they do not want to drive the prices down so they choose to sell on OTC platforms
On the other side big investors want to buy big amounts which if done in normal exchanges would drive the price up.
So big miners and big buyers use OTC because it is more convenient to them.
And this does not affect too much the price on normal exchanges.

Depends what does he mean by "crypto". Major part of cryptocurrencies are centralized. Luckily for Bitcoin it isn't.  Of course you should never hold coins on a centralized exchange. There are many decentralized exchanges .

Tjose are facts. Venezuela is in a state of default since September 2017 because of debt missed payments by around 10 Billions. A full debt default would result in fewer options for the government to sell the oil and creditors around the world might try to seize oil shipments.
So the question might be if the oil is still owned by PDVSA ?

Venezuela is going full into crypto but not in Petro. They do not need a another government form of money.
Countries with hyperinflation like Venezuela, Turkey and Iran are more inclined toward cryptocurrencies because of the lack of trust in their government issued currencies.
The government is trying to use a shitcoin to resolve the monetary crisis which is destroying the lives of people in Venezuela.

FIAT is the government money, not the people's money. Instead of being a medium of exchange and a store of value it is just a tool for governments to exercise power benefitting the world's richest. Choosing bitcoin removes this power from the government giving it back to the people.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:07:30
Yes, you are right, If bitcoin price comes near the production cost there is not anymore incentive to mine so some miners will switch-off their mining machines making mining profitable again.
But at this point, if prices go down more and more, other miners will need to switch off again and again until bitcoin enters in a death spiral. 
However, this is not the case because bitcoin's future seems bright and after the halving, the production cost will double. 
Considering the bottom at $3,150 when some miners started switching off their machines the next lowest production cost will be at $6,300.

An organization that has the exclusive right to control the supply of money is not a good thing. That is what governments do.  
In the Soviet Union, the government had even the monopoly to plan the economy and we know how things ended for them.
The currency competitiveness model is necessary to remove the state's monopoly to control people's lives like Kings did in the past. 
Governments can be voluntary organizations that compete with the private sector in the "creation of money" and maybe this way we will have better money, more transparency, more freedom and less financial crisis.

 It is normal that most investors tend to skeptical on this phase of the market cycle. Even in the Wall Street cheat sheet, this phase is called "Disbelief".
