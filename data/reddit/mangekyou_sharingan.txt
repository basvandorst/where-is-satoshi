You clone A and make B but somehow A is fake and B is original. The original is fake and the clone is original. The original (Bitcoin) is fake and the clone/fork (Bitcoin Cash) is original. That’s some real inception shit.

LOL. It was meant as self criticism. From 5.7 to 3.6. Lost all the profits I ever made.

Nice example but it is based on the government giving away free money and every inhabitant of the fake country having exactly the same amount of money.

You should dump your coins and come to LTC before its too late

If crypto becomes a serious threat to banks, they will do whatever they can to destroy it. Think about it, if every central bank in every country cooperates and creates hyperinflation, it will destroy cryptos without affecting the countrys economy.

I have access to free electricity. Its the noise thats stopping me from buying
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:38:52
I thought they kept their original amount of BTC and got the same amount of Bcash for free. Double money

Those who can afford multiple setups and have access to cheaper or free electricity

I’ve been there. Had a nightmare I checked the coinbase app. All three cryptos had hit 0. I woke up sweaty too. First thing I did was check the app, then I went back to sleep. This was when I had only 6 litecoins

Its 1415 USD on Bitmain. Im seriously considering buying one. But I live in a no bedroom apartment, it makes too much noise :(
EDIT: BTW. Do you get paid 35 USD worth of BTC, or BTC worth 35 USD? If I get 0.01 BTC this month, how much will I get next month?

Even if they create a global price increase to match the inflation? If they create a global price increase, nothing gets affected. 100% price increase with 100% inflation evens out. Im talking about a worst case scenario, where crypto takes over and the banks are about to collapse
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:10:48
Well, Im an engineer, not an economist. So I could be completely wrong. But I fail to see how a 10% global price increase matched with a 10% global inflation could affect any countrys economy. If you have have a job that pays 1 dollar/hour and a banana costs 1 dollar. Tomorrow you wake up and the same banana now costs 10 dollar, but you get 10 dollars/hour. You how does that affect you or the country, considering the same price change and inflation is created in every single country in the world?

Question is. HOW CAN WE STOP THEM? Fucking capitalists are taking over crypto too
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:27:25
Not if all central banks cooperate. The banking elite are evil, they control the world, they can get away with anything.
BTW. I understand I sound paranoid now, Im not, Its just for the sake of discussion
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:22
I don’t know.  
It could be that people downloaded coinbase to join the 40% bitcoin spike, but they were too late and decided to buy LTC. 
Or it could be because bitcoin and ether transactions are failing, people needed a way to transfer their coins so they bought LTC 
Charlies recent interviews, steam ditching BTC for LTC, bitrefill now accepting LTC. 
Or it could be nothing of what I mentioned 
Edit: it really is a great coin though. I don’t get why so many are hating on it

Who premined 10000 blocks for themselves? Im guessing Ver and his gang of frauds. What do you mean, anyone can make their own fork? This is the part of BTC I dont understand. I remember that Tweet and your'e right, Andreas has no class. He's still licking vers balls. Wish the community would make me a millionaire too though. Or save me from my debt :P
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:49:46
Ver says inside trading is not a crime meanwhile, Charlie Lee sells all his Litecoins so no one can accuse him of manipulating the market.
One of them is a true leader. Guess which one

I bought IOTA at 5.7... Can anyone beat that?
