You don't there is corruption in crypto?

I own bitcoin as well, trust me I am loving this hike. But what you just said supports my answer. If there isn't any fundamentals backing up the current price, then it's just pure speculation.

The idea of Bitcoin is never going away. If you want to store your money in Crypto then you will always be able to regardless of the price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:45:43
Eh, I think I got my answer then
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:43:18
What's the relevancy in saying you are a 20 year old student. I wouldn't buy until the price starts trending upwards, right now it's dropping.

But's not made out of thin air. I liked Bitcoin at 3k back in the summer but now it's just fools gold.

People are pumping the price up just to dump it. Like a lot of people are plotting together to take their money out once it reaches a certain price

I hate posts that start off like "I'm 18 and a Senior in High School". What difference does that make? And yeah Bitcoin is interesting but buying at 16,400 was not smart. You bought it while it was being pumped/hyped, never do that in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:23
It's been pumped, there is no news or reason to back up the hike
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:58:38
LOL the whole point of bitcoin is there is no regulation. So no, any thing is game
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:45
Let's see this proof

Oh.My.Gosh this is the dumbest logic I have ever seen in my life, to the point I am starting to question if this is a troll post.

Trust me. The majority of people who own stocks do not believe in bitcoin at all, at least not at its price right now. They think it’s way over valued and pumped up. So if fell, 90% of them are going to laugh and say, “I saw that coming from a mile away”. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:56
You don't catch a falling knife, you buy when it is trending back upwards
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:33:37
Someone who is trying to understand something is an idiot. Got it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:51:58
Dude, you are vastly over estimating Crypto Currency. The USD isn't going anywhere. You think the government would let that happen?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:51
The idea of crypto is brilliant but so much shady stuff goes on. I guess this is what happens when there really are no rules

Is the stock market even close as volatile as crypto? Did the stock market have 80% gains in one month like Bitcoin has?  Not to mention only 4% of people have more than $20,000 in bitcoin. Most investors are college kids putting $50-500 and have never even invested in the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:36:06
Or because the people that took Bitcoin to 19k were never serious investors and had a case of the FOMO, and the true valuation of a bitcoin should be around 2k-4k like it was last summer
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:30:37
That is by the dumbe--. Yes, short PayPal

Even if those said companies had to close their doors and declare bankruptcy we would not see a recession because of it ��. I’m sorry for coming off as a total dick
