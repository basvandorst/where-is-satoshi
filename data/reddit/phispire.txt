That's fair, I appreciate the thoughtful response...I have been being a bit of an A**hole.  I'm hoping that the market will find a way to spread the work out and perhaps select BTC for higher transactions, LTC for like TVs and stuff, and FTC for everyday stuff (not sure if this just transfers the burden down the line while increasing inflation, though).

If this (as well as the blockchain size) have been an issue since the beginning, and "bitcoin doesn't scale well" and "was never meant to handle more than 10000.whatever txs per second" then what kind of BS snake oil did you sell us? certainly not a viable currency. :(  Very Sad Panda!

If BTC were to be a $million, how would you conduct your transaction equal to a penny?  Oh, just fork the chain again?  
If 54 mBTC is a penny, then one BTC is $185.185185185...just hope you didn't buy above that or be ready to take a loss (since like you, no-one does a transaction less than a penny).

You can't call it "stability," it's nothing but bots trading back and forth...lame :( ruining my new favorite sport :(

Agreed, this ^  Even if this isn't an Empire or an Aristocracy and the so-called "developers" and "foundation members" are subject to the people/miners; it is an Oligarchy since it would take only one or two pools to fork the chain.

Most, if not all, I assume are bot trades...not only do they come all around that same size, they lead to a "blocky" looking market where the highs and lows all line up...doesn't look fluid or organic at all (usually see it when we get below 20K volume or so).

"You're too small for us to waste our precious electricity on" just shows the down-side of greed.  You can't be happy that your computer is passively earning you money, got to have more, huh?
Why not nothing less than 10 BTC or 100,000 BTC, boy would that speed up the network...there'd only be like two txs to process! Hooray!  Meantime, you'd ensure that BTC are worth only pennies for them to be actually usable by anyone other than the oligarchs (preminers/institutional investors).
