Percentage wise it is...

Or it could keep going up....  The truth is you really don't know.
Everyone tried to tell me it was going to crash at 1000, at 2000, at 3000, at 5000, at 10,000...
This rise is smaller than in 2013.

Why do so many people keep saying that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:59
Pretty soon a 50% dip will bring us to 10,000 haha, so what?

We went up 75% this last week.  We went up a lot more % in about a week during the 2013 rise.
Nov 20th 2013 was $482. Nov 29th 2013 was $1,100, a 130% increase in about 9 days.

OK, well you edited your original comment about short run sustainability.
If course I don't expect to be sustainable in the short run.  I plan to sell my bitcoin in decades when I retire, not any time soon.  It will either be worthless or worth a lot.  I'm OK with either.
I'm not interested in micromanaging buying and selling constantly.

... The point is not that people put their life savings in BTC, it's that they put their savings in a location that they could easily lose access to at any time with no warning.  A place that is not regulated or insured properly.
I keep my savings in a long established, regulated, insured, trusted financial institution.  Which I can assure you is a LOT safer than storing your money on MtGox's servers.

But the Mainline DHT is a network which is what makes bittorrent decentralized.  It was based directly on Kademlia.

Who says he has any progeny?

But this time we don't have MtGox fail.

Definitely learned this stuff as a junior undergrad as a software engineering major.

I think he meant collectively many people could lose smaller amounts due to error or misunderstanding and it could add up to $100k+.

IMO the CS program should cover this kind of stuff. There should be whole courses on "best practices". And things like software design patterns where you learn to use the tried and true design patterns rather than trying to reinvent the wheel yourself all the time.

Yes... Because they can hire more people and buy, install and configure more servers in hours or days...
Try months.

I always liked watching the action on this one.

I don't think you understand percentages.
Just cause the price of a bitcoin changes drastically doesn't mean the dollar amount of trading changes.
If the price of a bitcoin drops to half, but people then buy and sell twice as many bitcoins (since their same money is now worth twice as many coins) then MtGox makes the same amount of money.
If I have $1000 that I want to invest in bitcoin if I buy 10 coins for $100 each or 100 coins for $10 each MtGox makes $6 either way.  If anything, they want the price to go up and down constantly which causes people to keep trading coins back and forth thus resulting in more transactions and more money moving back and forth.
