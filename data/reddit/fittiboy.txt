It IS funny though how in the first minutes they are kinda convenient for BCH haters lol
(Please don't kill me for this. It's just an observation. I myself am almost entirely certain that it's coincidence. I'm not on Roger's side.)

One thing I don't understand about this:
Why does everyone seem to think that provoking someone who is easily provoked is the best course of action in what's supposed to be an at least somewhat objective discussion?
Serious question. Haven't thought about this much, but there are probably hundreds of books that cold answer it. Maybe someone here has read a few?
I mean, of course you try to make yourself look better and your "enemy" weak or too emotional. That way you can "win". But really winning (without the "") can include "losing" a debate. Because "losing" just means getting proven wrong. That's super helpful because you don't have to waste any more time thinking about an issue the wrong way.
So I guess my first question isn't really the question, but rather: How do we fix this as a community?
Note: By "win" or "lose" (with the "") I mean winning or losing on a personal, subjective level. Getting your feelings hurt, basically (which is a reall loss, of course). To win or to lose (without the "") in this case means helping or hindering progress, respectively.

pissed me off too, but afterwards I read how it all started and the whole rant was supposed to be "why I think you are stupid"

Bitcoin doesn‘t solely rely on internet though.
Any way of relaying data works!

"for no reason"...
how is anyone supposed to believe you after it happened AGAIN?
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:37:54
Sure, but what are the chances of every means of communication dying all at the same time?
In theory you could even relay a transaction to a miner or node owner by smoke signal, which I really wanna see now that I think about it :D

Before you blindly follow the dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy that is so loved here:
[Paywalled]( but just read the abstract
Some [analysed data]( about DCA
[Some more]( stuff about DCA
Edit: If you want to save money every month and put some into Bitcoin, that is of course DCA as well, but in that case it's probably the best and only option.

Kind of a flawed investment strategy though, as Bitcoin's market dominance is also rising. Meaning it is growing *faster* than the altcoins on average.

Hectosats would be an "h" and "sats" somehow combined to make it easy to say and remember...

I'd love to be in the shoes of someone who was certain that bitcoin died after that $20k bubble. Now it's suddenly "coming back" and people ought to be confused as hell :D

Well, he used Bitcoin to buy a super expensive car. That seems somewhat relevant to the bitcoin subreddit.
