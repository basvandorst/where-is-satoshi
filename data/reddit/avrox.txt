;) You sure about that? Just read it not seeing your point from the link you just posted. ??? the cartel of nonconsumers who are using oil futures as part of an investing strategy that includes endless attempts to corner the market for crudes in order to make fortunes for them. that's what they did in 2008 when they cornered it and took it to $147. This --- From your link. Not to mention the cornering of fiat currencies by the banking cartel.

Was listening to clarkmoody rtbtc and someone bought around 337,000 dollars worth of coins through the mtgox exchange. It ding'd so fast my computer couldn't keep up. shot the price up to around 223.00. was just funny.

I just posted a link graph for people to look at, as I'm not an investor per se', with all of the research I've done and every "Dealer/Vendor" I've spoken with concerning it even if it doesn't make the mainstream grade it will always have a solid place in the underground/black market. There are people on both sides just as in any currency. Even when it stabilizes there will be someone who will exchange at a price and then sell at a price. Once everyone figures out there position relative.
