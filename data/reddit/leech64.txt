Haha for realz bro. Its that market psychology. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:34:51
So cultured.
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:46:33
So you think trump wants to inflate the dollar to implode the Banker system and replace it with sound money? Trump is a big friend of banks, and banks thrive under inflationary conditions. What would lead you to this conclusion?
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:48:00
For reals bro. Honestly Im just waiting on bitcoin to moon and the housing market to crash so I can buy a nice big house flat out.
After that I can just work a brainless job ya know what I mean?

DAt bail out money finally seepin out
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:29:15
Why else then, retard?
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:15:56
He probably just wants to inflate the dollar so he can finally pay off his personal debt. what a loser.
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:48:38
Haha, your username made me chuckle. Very clever, my good chum.
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:27:44
England: Uh, about that...
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:37:34
Well I mean if they need to keep USDT/USD at 1:1 dont they need to keep printing or destroying some to keep it at that ratio?
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:18:27
What are the values of u and p? I sure hope u and p are positive integers.

Come visit the west coast, the east coast is like 400 years old. 
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:10:13
The officials already found and spent it thats why, haha jk.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:37:03
True, I did some math earlier though and it turns out that if bitcoin were the only crypto, the price would be about 175% higher at around $14,000/bitcoin currently.
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:04:57
Damn, I suppose I am wrong. Thank you for researching this.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:46:35
No, do not be misled. It will be a long time before fiat completely busts. Here in the US, it is the federal law that you must accept payment in US legal tender if offered. So a  seller must accept US dollars if presented by the buyer, or else the seller can be convicted. This law must change before fiat can go bust, and it takes a while before laws change in the US.
On a different note, some US banks charge monthly for a checking account, and have done so for a while now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:32:33
Haha, sincerely, thats is some actually some great advice, and a great way of putting it.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:41:53
No i think it means if the business is centered around bitcoin exchanges you need a licence. So those bitcoin atms would need a license, and exchanges here in cali would need a license. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:52:31
Why would you want to control it? Its an unregulated free market as it should be.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:10:40
True dat. If us fishes collectively have strong hands, the whales wont be able to buy back in at a some point.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:54:43
Is coinbase pro a mobile phone application?
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:13:01
Yeah but no. Only when electric vehicles have a 5 minute full charge time will we be able to replace petroleum fueled vehicles. Just like bitcoin will take over when it only takes me 1-10 seconds to make a common day transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:25:05
You know, seasoned investors probably got out at the 17k mark,
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:19:59
Actually, its going up because of the behaviour of the market. As people value it more, they will sell or buy for a higher price. Not much different than other markets. Inherently, bitcoin prevents double spending which places it with on tier with gold.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:31:14
Ah ok, i see your technicality.
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:32:45
Ah,  so you stole my crypto tech algorithm back when i formulated it on fortran for ibm’s room sized computers.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:20:09
it might, but it sure isnt illegal. You can refuse to testify against yourself, and this is  what the situation falls under.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:27:08
Congrats man, now lets get those profits OvER 9000!!
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:39:20
Haha classic! 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:34:32
I doubt that will happen.
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:55:42
Why is everyone going nuts? we saw this happen like 10 times in the last three  months; what is so special about this instance?
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:37:19
Preach it man!
@_date: 2019-10-06 21:05:05
No, you cannot. Always preview the buy
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:27:50
Just dive into it and play with a small amount to get the feel of how the market works. You’ll learn little lessons here and there to make you a more confident trader. The golden rule: Dont invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:42:11
I'm not in favor of the bills, just to be clear.
I skimmed through it and that is just what it seemed to be. I wasn't stating facts, just writing what I thought it meant at glance. 
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:26:46
depends man, I think some hyundai's go for $100/ month. 
Given the situation, that is a pretty good deal. As long as you dont go over the miles alloted
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:30:44
Its not being manipulated. Many things influence the price. Mainly its a battle between what people want to sell it at, and what people want to buy it at.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:55:44
Its because they are filling orders that may not be at the current price I believe.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:39:52
You should stop spreading FUD. If china were banned, people would still do it. And if not, the mining difficulty would decrease and mining could become profitable in places where it wasnt. Even then it doesnt matter because non banned miners would replace their workload since difficulty is dropped. You obviously do not know how bitcoin works. So stop scaring people. No one knows what the price will be so stop pretending you know.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:50:53
I'd say bills are more practical than crypto in low amounts. Say you want to buy a candy bar from a friend. You hand him a dollar from your wallet, and thats that. No tech needed. Perhaps its a lack of foresight, but I doubt crypto would be that easy not even 50 years from now.
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:03:43
People are what drive the cost.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:45:54
Congrats man. 
But to be honest and helpful, i dont think you should post your byc holdings. Its a security risk in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:15:01
It is still april 1st in some places though at the time of this comment.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:40:59
Exactly what i said my good chum. OP doesnt know shit.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:18:45
Its probably gonna be logarithmic. 
As the price goes up, to increase the price by another thousand, itwill require 200 million dollars..... and so forth. Just a guess.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:20:12
Im just saying compared to if he bought that much crypto in January 2018.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:42:47
So true
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:02:52
I forgive you
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:24:33
You may just have to start using different exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:56:07
Haha no worries.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:12:57
Nice, you are getting in at a good time. Not much to lose. But you probably should not post your exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:30:26
I mean I dont think it will die. It is useful in what it provides; which is a means of accounting value. I think In the world of digital currencies, Bitcoin will be analogous to Gold.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:24:58
Per your last statement, true, but it is so hard not to look.  
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:55:53
I doubt inflation is the reason.
America was able to accomplish that with its workforce and good values. 
Maybe its not like that now, but that was the attitude back then when those things you listed were accomplished.
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:21:21
Maybe other previously orders got filled in first? Or maybe they are still being filled?
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:46:30
When inflation occurs though, its usually because the government is printing more money. Essentially they are stealing from you indirectly. Government shouldn’t be responsible for the economy either. Its only supposed to provide infrastructure to regulations and a powerful military to protect its citizens. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:13:13
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:28:10
Dude just use coinbase. Bitcoin can be bought in any denomination up to 8 decimals after the zero(i think its 8). Who ever is trying to sell by the integer is trying to scam you. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:00:21
Wow. Do you guys think itll go down further? I wanna buy another...
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:14:18
Lets say the whales arent done “accumulating.” Does that mean that the price could drop further?
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:19:25
Ahh yeaa thar sweet coin .. mmmmph
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:00:13
he probably asking how much value, in dollars, has your bitcoin depreciated.
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:51:58
Hi man, the truth is no one knows what the price will be at any given moment. People can predict what it will be, and some lucky people will. 
Bitcoin price in dollars is controlled by supply and demand, the psychology of the market, and inflation of the US dollar.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:16:19
Any number i give you is going to be a guess with no basis. But id like the price of bitcoin to be around at least $100,000 by the end of 2020.
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:10:48
Uh no... probably the UN-observatable universe haha!
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:07:36
yeah but its too late to do that now since it is 2019 already right? in terms of claiming deductions for 2018
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:50:16
Look inflation isnt “bad” 
But the government printing more money to pay its debt is because it is reducing its citizens purchasing power. This type of inflation is bad and should be made illegal.  
The only time the mint should print is when old paper money is too worn or destroyed. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 14:48:09
thats around $50k-$60k per bitcoin, or 500% increase in price. this is after the halving, so i think it is feasible
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:10:16
its because they are matching your prices to another's orders I believe. If you keep going back and previewing the purchase, you will see that it changes. Keep doing this until you see the price you want. I'm not sure if coinbase shows average last price or just last price.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:34:05
Expert traders can make a small fortune shorting on the way up, so why not, right? I wish i had those skills.
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:48:07
He is just a player hater.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:58:32
Most of their crypto is stored offline, so it would require a physical robbery I think
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:32:58
For realz, it’ll happen when im like, “bitcoin just goes up, its what it does”
And then BOOM! Swatted like a fly.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:57:41
All exchanges have different prices. Some people take advantage of this to make profit, and it is called arbitrage. The same can be done with stocks and currency. 
Also, some exchanges use USDT(tether) and not USD. They are two different things, one is crypto, and the other is fiat, respectively.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:28:47
They might, and im sure it does happen. But bcash is a legitimate blockchain, and it is rightfully priced.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:10:46
Depends on your phrasing and grammar. 
Two valid examples:
How much bitcoin do you have?
How many bitcoins do you have?
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:39:27
 No she cant , but she can wear her private keys, haha
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:54:11
Capitulation juuust happened. We got out of it like three days ago haha.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:32:52
Yeah it is.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:24:15
Hi there,
You can download apps to view it.
I use crypto pro. Works pretty good I think.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:59:04
who knows when. Either bitcoin will become so valuable that  it will become worth 20K again, or the dollar will become so shitty that it will take $20,000 to equal the value of a bitcoin. nobody knows when, but it will certainly happen. probably within the decade for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:38:17
Absolutely. But it would be so incredibly difficult and require so much mass coordination and money that the chance of it happening is nearly zero. So close to zero that you can consider it to be zero, even though it technically is not..... depending on which mathmetician you talk to.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:03:07
probably not. Because of Bitcoin's volume, it would need serious money for pump and dump, like 10s of billions from like 20 people. Or millions from like 10,000 people. That cannot really coordinated. Its just the market: people see the price going up and FOMO. Others see this price as a reasonable purchase and do so.  
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:31:38
There are also alot of people who visit this page that are not subscribers. I am one of them. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:29:53
Another thing to note is that some exchanges post the trading pair of btc/usdt which is tether not actual us dollars. Btc/ usd can sometimes be lower than btc/usdt
