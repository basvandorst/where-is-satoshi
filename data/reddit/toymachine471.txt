I'm unaware of what's happening. Can you enlighten me? All I know is coinbase is bad idk why or what's happening. I leave bitcoin for a few days and there's something new again

The price did dip from like 19k to 16k and I was like what now. I just assumed it was FUD but I didn't know it was connected to coinbase. Thanks for the info. I'll just keep calm and hodl

Lol. People be like “you guys gotta be positive and wait for adoption.” Next post, “do you not know everything about bitcoin? Leave this sub and never come back.” “So when is adoption gonna start picking up?” Like idk how people don’t realize shoving everyone away is the exact opposite of adoption

People want to make money. Lots of people couldn’t care less about making it a currency. It’s kinda like saying those people should go to work to help their employer rather than make money for their own benefit. Only a minority actually cares about it. But what’s wrong with that? People come here wanting to make money but they might find out more about bitcoin and decide to buy some to support the currency along with making money. There’s no one that doesn’t want to make money from bitcoin tho. Also there’s too many people who flame the others that want to make money. You don’t see me going to the stock market and flaming people for wanting to make money rather than being a proud owner of .0001% of google

How come I won't make a profit? I'm not disagreeing I just don't know how it works. I know that over time it's going to be harder to mine a block and I don't have a good miner to begin with. I don't pay for electricity tho

You know looking at some stuff monero does look interesting. People say it's undervalued right now and will increase in the future. How do you know I'll make $2 a day? I don't know how hash rates and stuff works. Also would it be like bitcoin where I'd have to join a pool to make any money or can I just mine solo

Wow you’re a sad waste of breath. Cya
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:11:10
Yes because if you google bitcoin you won’t find any biased sources or fud. And bitcoin posts always have the information I want right? Like how playboy is accepting crypto as payment? That answers my question right? You’re probably some asswipe kid who has like $10 in bitcoin. This isn’t a playground please stfu cunt

I feel like I’ve only seen ads on Shit coins ico’s and stuff. I’ve never seen them on actual bitcoin

So the first part makes no sense. You quoted me asking you what your gain is from negative comments. Your response “nothing” and you don’t need to offer value to the less-informed. You put a snobby ass comment towards someone you don’t know for “nothing” and your argument is you don’t need to help them? You don’t need to help them but who said it’s mandatory to be negative? What a terrible argument. The second part is pretty hypocritical. I guess in that sense I also just “wanted to post something, so I did.” If that to you is being unable to deal with it does that mean you are unable to deal with everyone on here that doesn’t have beginner crypto knowledge? You can quote me all you want and make even more terrible statements but I honestly don’t give a fuck. There’s just no reason to act arrogant just because the average joe doesn’t understand volatility as well as you. Good day

Can you not be toxic for no reason. There’s probably a large amount of people who come here and try to read more on it and comments like yours doesn’t do anything helpful
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:26:49
You don’t have to help people but what does posting negative comments do? If it’s a common problem then that obviously means the average joe doesn’t understand volatility. Am I asking you to explain that to everyone? No. But what’s your gain in negative comments towards the less-informed? If it’s that annoying then just don’t say anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:28:47
Are you obligated to post snobby point comments? No. You don’t need to help people but there’s no point in posting shit like “cry me a river” when the comment was a joke
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:37:22
Yeah but regardless of that there’s no reason to put snobby comments. What does that do? I just think it’s dumb how people assume everyone knows as much as they do then act rude towards them. Also the way he said it was a joke. No idea why you would take him “crying” literal
