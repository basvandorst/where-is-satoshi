I have had an account for a very long time (it was still called Bitcoin Central when I opened it), and I have traded there, and got money out with no problems at all.
It's not like Kraken, where there's connection errors all the time and you never know if an order was placed or not, or if your 'cancel' click was detected.
It's very nice and responsive, but it seems dead now. No trading going on, no Euro funding of your account possible.
I think they were changing banks or something, but I don't trust it and I got out all the coins I had left there immediately.

I also think the argument against a deflationary currency is wrong. The reasoning is from the consumer side: "Why would you buy anything right now, if you know your money will buy you more later?", this is supposed to keep consumers from spending and slow down the economy. This argument can be reversed symmetrically, and you could reason from the producer side, all the money you can make right now will be worth more later, better make it right now." So this would put a competitive pressure on the productive side of society, making everyone want to work first, to enjoy the fruits of their labour later, thus stimulating the economy. Furthermore, the drive behind consumer spending isn't that their money devaluates, it's that they need to consume stuff right now, to live.

That's a big difference right there, because I have seen orders like this disappear as soon as the market price hits that value, so I would guess, it's to give the impression.
My question, of course is, in what way do they benefit from doing this? Why make everyone think they're going to buy a fuckload of bitcoins at that price? Are they forcing genuine buyers to buy higher or never get anything? Are they selling above that price at the same time and hope the price tanks when they take away the order, to buy back cheaper? What is their motivation?

How would linking the transaction reveal the bullshit? Anyone can make a transaction, especially to themselves.

I had a (relatively modest) amount of cash I was moving out of the exchange at the time of the bankruptcy. The transaction was confirmed, and the money should have been on my bank account already. I filed a claim. My question is this: WHEN WILL I GET THE MONEY?
