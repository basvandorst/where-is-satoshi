Great dip forward?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:56:36
This is gold!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:36:16
Damn straight!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:14:59
Good. Unhook the chains. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:53:17
Which is still a fantastic return for .01. Maybe the little girl can just pay the college of choice this denomination in trade for 8 semesters of tuition?

I’ll eat my and your sock for 10+. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:46:40
My moon is 20k. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:25:14
I’m hoping we get near 20k per coin. Just my guess, but if institutional $ gets involved...could be realistic. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:27:06
My head might explode. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:00:26
June and this year. $2400 I think?

You are better off with the Bitcoins than her, anyway. Good luck to your next chapter!

Ha. Ha. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:28:33
Ok, must be me. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:12:44
Ditto.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:48:59
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:41:20
Lol. Sorry!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:44:50
$9500; alternate universe stuff here!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:14:04
This happened at the run to $9k too. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:13:25
Added about 25% to my stash today. Wish I could, grab more. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:50:20
If the price keeps dropping, I’ll buy every last Bitcoin on earth. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:40:33
Don’t ever change!

This is awesome!
