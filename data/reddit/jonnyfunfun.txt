This.  Until people can actually comb through the source, nearly everybody is going to think it's a sleeper that is going to steal their wallets.

If somebody really wanted claims to a particular prefix, I'd tend to think they're enough of an advanced user to have checked the blockchain first.  Do you really think it's worth while to implement this check automatically?  If there's enough demand for it, a check could be done, sure.  I don't think it's really going to be worth my while to do so - I think split-key generation is going to be more important.

So this is my first stab at a project like this.  I'm open to all suggestions and feedback!  I'm working on split-key generation, but for right now regular generation is all there is.

So this is a new service I just put together.  I'm happy to take any suggestions from you guys!  Also, if you find something to be broken - I want to know that, too!

Split key generation is when two private keys are used to get the vanity address instead of one.  One private key you know and is never known by the service.  You take the public key corresponding to the private and give it to the website.  The private key (containing the solution to your vanity address) is then given to you, but it isn't complete.  You need the generated private key AND your key (which, again, isn't known to anybody but you).  You just add the two of them together to get your vanity address.
This is a good read about it:

Your first and second points are my first and second on the roadmap, as well. :)
I've got a free Freshdesk helpdesk setup at  where I plan on putting FAQ's and what-not (also a place for people to ask for help).
After the split-key and making the help desk more populated, I think I can look into a firstbits checker.  Thanks for the suggestions!

Yes, it is caps sensitive. Also, for any prefix there is an inordinate number of possible combinations, so there isn't a need to track rights to any one prefix

I don't log anything but traffic. Private keys go right from the generator to the client via a secure websocket. After the client has it shown on their screen, there's no way for me to ever get it back. 
In the case of a paid generation, I wait long enough for a single confirmation before beginning generation. Most of that is handled by bitpay's API.

Yeah, this is my first thing written in Node.  The stacktraces should be off now.  It's all a learning experience :)

That's partly why I'm working on split-key generation. Then you don't have to place trust in me to use it.

Best. Comment. Ever.

That's how I interpret it, as well.  Otherwise it just doesn't make any sense how it could happen.  Pretty ingenious on FriendlyChemist's part if that's truly the case.
