this will be hilarious to watch, especially since linus tech tips just started a short series on bitcoin mining...using nicehash

i think at the end of the doc the in person exchange they ran was shut down : /

pretty sure commenting on it will reset the queue for your ticket and push it to the back.
what wallet did you send it to? if it's bitcoin cash or gold then there's a chance you can get it back. otherwise you might be fucked

man if she gave away about a million, I'm pretty sure she isn't worried about taxes on that

either from people who wanted to buy it from you, so you'd probably have to wait a few days to fully liquidate depending on demand, or you could ask if the exchange was interested in purchasing the btc themselves with their own funds
I know gemini also has options to auction off large sums of BTC that you wouldn't be able to easily liquidate on the exchange yourself

lmao you are literally talking about *walking* as your example, something which is reflexive in nature, and comparing that to bitcoin, as if bitcoin is reflexively learnt rofl. They are *completely* different scenarios. 


What a completely pointless emphasis. You think a baby only sees one person walking in their entire lives before doing it themselves or some shit? And why the hell would it matter in this case if its a single reference or multiple? Walking isn't a research paper. Not to mention that you don't need references for something deemed common knowledge (source: my honors in biology where I did research papers all the fucking time).  
This is legitimately one of the stupidest analogies I've seen.
On top of that, the professor literally says himself he doesn't know what [bitcoin] is and *doesn't know much about it*, then proceeds to give advice and you compare that to walking, which your parents CLEARLY know a lot about, because you can literally see them walking all the time. 
In one case, you take advice or *reference* (emphasis on singular - oh wait it doesn't even fucking matter rofl) from someone/people clearly experienced, and in the other, someone who says he doesn't know anything about it.
Absolutely brilliant analogy bro. Just stunning.

??? what he's saying there is what a lot of people are thinking. why the hell do you need S2X if you already have big blocks in bcash? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:36:36
not much of a prediction when its less than 10% away at this point lmao
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:27:54
yeah they only plotted 1 year of bitcoin vs the others with 10 years for some reason
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:29:30
its been like a day since 11k dude lmao

jpmorgan is literally in the EEA lol, pretty sure he said this to buy lower
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:51:36
I don't agree, I called it bcash there and actively shat on bcash when I posted there before and no ban, no warning, nothing. Downvotes? Sure. 
But that's pretty different from altering the css of the sub to hide when mods delete comments and banning scaling conversations that they don't like. 
Not that the bcash sub isn't *also* a tremendous echo chamber, but this one just a different beast. I mean, I even expect to get banned from this sub for *this* comment. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:47:16
if you've read literally any of my posts there I'm always shitting on bcash lmao. I don't think you know the censorship history of this sub given your extremely naive narrative.
And wtf do you mean spending a lot of time over there? I haven't been there in like two months and I've only posted for maybe 2 weeks there. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:51:52
this guy reminds me of alex jones lmao
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:49:30

@_date: 2017-06-15 14:19:49
he supports segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:23:25
this is really stupid, 1k price drop on btc is not just volatility rofl
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:31:07
peaked at 2995 and dropped to low 2005 over 4 days on poloniex
the current rebound doesn't make the 1k drop any less true. Unless you really want me to type 990$ drop.
