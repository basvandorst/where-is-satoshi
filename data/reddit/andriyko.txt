Oh, I see. What is a "listening" node?

Still not understanding it. Is there somewhere I can learn more about this?

"In our view, the Lightning network can easily scale to many multiples of Bitcoin’s current onchain transaction volume without encountering any economic fee market cycles or issues, all based purely on hobbyist liquidity providers. However, if the network is to reach the scale many Lightning advocates hope, it will need to attract liquidity from yield hungry investors seeking to maximise risk adjusted investment returns. Should that occur, unfortunately the network may experience significant changes in fee market conditions as the investment climate changes over time.
However, it is relatively easy to set up a node, provide liquidity and try to earn fee income by undercutting your peers. Where the balance is ultimately struck between the operational channels of running nodes, the extent of liquidity provision and the investment returns, we obviously do not know. However, if we are forced to guess, based on the architecture and design of the Lightning network, we would say the system is somewhat rigged towards users and low fees, rather than liquidity providers."

"The messaging companies have a reach that dwarfs the backers of earlier cryptocurrencies. Facebook and Telegram can make the digital wallets used for cryptocurrencies available, in an instant, to hundreds of millions of users."
"The current designs being discussed generally do away with the energy-guzzling mining process that Bitcoin relies on."
"The lack of a central authority over cryptocurrencies — a government or a bank — has made them useful to criminals and scammers, and the designs of the computer networks that manage them make it hard to handle significant numbers of transactions."
"The five people who have been briefed on the Facebook team’s work said the company’s most immediate product was likely to be a coin that would be pegged to the value of traditional currencies, as [Bloomberg first reported](
"The company is [overhauling its messaging infrastructure]( which would connect three of its properties — Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. That integration, which could take more than a year, would extend the reach of Facebook’s digital currency across the 2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month."
"Facebook employees have told the exchanges that they are hoping to get a product out in the first half of the year."

I think this is a very good question.
Every transaction in Bitcoin can have many inputs and many outputs.
So there are a few scenarios that can happen when you pay exchange $US dollars and they transfer you BTC (this last part is called a "transaction" and is stored in blockchain):
Scenario 1: Many to one
Exchange creates a transaction that has many inputs (for example 0.1BTC, 0.2BTC, 0.7BTC - which add up to 1BTC). The transaction also has one output (your address).
In this case, exchange had "many" bits, but after transaction is recorded on the chain, all those bits now belong to you as "one" coin.
Scenario 2: One to Many with "change"
Exchange may already have MORE than 1BTC at a given address. Say they have "1.5BTC". Stay with me for this part...
In bitcoin you cannot make a transaction that transfers "part" of a coin-amount. So if you hold 1.5BTC in one address, when you transfer just 1BTC, ALL of 1.5BTC is destroyed, and two NEW "coins" are created - one of value 1BTC at one address (where you sent it to) and another of value 0.5BTC that is returned to YOU (this is basically "change").
So back to the exchange. When exchange transfers 1BTC from an address which had 1.5BTC, it essentially "breaks" that coin into two coins: 1BTC and 0.5BTC. So the transaction will have one input - 1.5BTC and two outputs: 1BTC, 0.5BTC. But from your point of view, you can still look at the 1BTC you received at your address as one "piece".
Scenario 3: One to Many with "split"
Let us suppose that the exchange actually has exactly 1BTC at the given address. However, you *may* decide that you don't want to store all of it in one address. You may ask the exchange to send 0.2BTC to one address, 0.3BTC and 0.5BTC to another.
In this case exchange would public a blockchain transaction that has 1 input - the address where the 1BTC comes from, and 3 outputs - the addresses that you own.
In this case you can think of it as "splitting" the coin into bits, and since you own all three addresses you may think of it this way.
Scenario 4: Many to Many ...
This is the most general scenario, and that is when the exchange does not have 1BTC at any given address, but the coin is "split" across many of it's addresses, e.g. 0.3BTC, 0.3BTC, 0.5BTC, which adds up to = 1.1BTC.
Suppose you also want to spit the 1BTC you receive into many pieces, say same as before: 0.2BTC to one address, 0.3BTC and 0.5BTC to another.
In this case, exchange would create a transaction with 3 inputs: 
* 0.3BTC
* 0.3BTC
* 0.5BTC
and four outputs (don't forget the "change" address):
* 0.3BTC (your address)
* 0.3BTC (your address)
* 0.4BTC (your address)
* 0.1BTC (exchange's address - change address)
So it is that you end up having 1BTC "in total" - scattered across many addresses, while exchange now has 0.1BTC in one place.
Of course, these "scenarios" are just a way to explain things. In reality there is always one or more inputs and one or more outputs.
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:14:25
Um... you only need to do it once if you specify just one address to receive it into.
I recommend this course if you really want to understand what's going on (skip harder bits):

"But what do you do about your private keys if you lose your phone? According to the T&amp;Cs, the private keys stored in the S10’s Keystore are backed up in a personal account provided by Samsung. If the phone is lost or stolen, users can access the device and delete the private key through its Find My Mobile service. Further, if a private key is accidentally deleted, users can restore it via the service.
Centralizing key storage in this way is bound to raise questions about security and it remains to be seen what would happen if someone gained access to your Find My Mobile service and if Samsung might provide further protections."

I see no problem with having a custodial LN wallet with a small balance. Much less of a problem than a custodial Bitcoin wallet. The benefit is very quick setup and operation. BlueWallet is a good example of this.

Sure, but people who had 10 Satoshi will still have 10 Satoshi. If you divide it into smaller unit like “half a Satoshi” then people will now have 20 “half Satoshi”. Limited supply does not refer to the inability to subdivide the supply, but to the inability of getting more at the current level of division, once the final coin is produced.

This is what is commonly referred to in software development as "Future Proofing". On-boarding the whole planet is a "nice" problem to have. If you have it - you know you succeeded. No matter \*what\* solution you come up with now, when the whole world will actually want to use BTC they will break your solution in some other way you have not thought of. If you try to design for the future (for the problems you don't have now) you will not only make the present system more complex and less efficient, you will also not be addressing the more important problems:
Look at this another way: for any system you design today, I can \*always\* propose a future scenario which your system will not satisfy. This is because there are infinitely many "potential" problems, but only few real ones.
P.S.: Good question.

 "Has the current Bitcoin governance model resulted in upgrades that increase Bitcoin’s value?
I think it’s impossible to establish a causal relationship. The price is much higher than it was 2 years ago, but it seems to be an endogenous process driven by *trader psychology*, not technological fundamentals. Regarding fundamentals, it’s undeniable that Bitcoin’s governance has delivered on consensus changes which the Lightning Network depends on to operate. I’ve been experimenting with establishing channels and making Lightning payments: there is no doubt in my mind that LN increases Bitcoin’s value."

You're correct. By using LN you abide by general protocol. That allows you to switch to non-costodial at any moment in the future. In fact, the other party you interact with will not see any difference.
