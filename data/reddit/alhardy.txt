I'm not sure there are any credible sources anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:39:49
Regardless of the intent, this would have a massive effect on the global economy. Considering the Fed is dumping bonds at the moment, i'm very curious to see how this plays out and hope all of you will be following this closely. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:53:09
That doesn't exclude it from happening in the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:19:31
CAN THIS BE PINNED PLEASE? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:04:34
Could be a leak they are covering up... 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:02:25
Sounds like "too big to fail" if you ask me. Doesn't exclude the possibility of it happening though. If they can assure that the collapse will hurt us more than them they would do it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:36:49
I think this may actually be the top. I turned 250$ into 25K in the matter of a year and a half. I'm starting to get greedy, EVERYONE is talking about bitcoin, and that's all I need to hear. I'm out of the space for a while. Will be back when the market calms down. SEE YA SOON. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:12:55
Definitely the future, but not in the next year or two. We've seen that there's potential, but A LOT of work needs to be done to get it up to par. I'll be back in slowly, but surely as this ship falls.

LOL Wall Street missed out and now they want to bet on bitcoins "demise" through leveraged derivatives. Best way to beat the banks... HODL like you've never HODL'd before. Even if this thing hits 100K USD. HODLLLLL
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:06:48
Satoshi must have understood that the Fed would follow Japan's economic policies and built Bitcoin to be a fail safe if it completely collapsed the financial system as we know it. For Christ's sake, the white paper was introduced a few months after the melt down started. This means Satoshi knew a major financial turn around was coming, he knew that Abenomics would be implemented and he could see that it would end badly and began working on an alternative reserve currency and store of value. AMAZING. I hope it plays out that way. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:18:03
Their instructional videos show an actual transaction though? Is it not "ready" because not every wallet is participating, or does bitcoin actually need to change its code for other wallets to start using a lightning network. I'm starting to think this idea of LIGHTNING is a huge scam that no one is actually working on to prop up the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:25:56
Bro, the best thing about bitcoin is THE PEOPLE invested in it before investment banking. Considering this is the first time this has happened, all the FUD from the media is significantly more transparent than ever. Stick it to these fuckers by HODLing so they have to buy high and sell low for once.

I asked my parents to consult with her "experienced" financial advisor about BTC and get his thoughts on the subject. I get a call a week later from my mom telling me to take my money out of bitcoin cause its a scam with nothing physical that says I own bitcoin... This was at 500$ and even though it's in 4k now they still can see clear enough to understand... 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:11:19
Ok, but shouldn't the goal be to participate?

I think they may have taken the HARD fork a little too seriously. Has anyone let them know they missed the point of the argument?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:51:44
Maybe draw a private key on it that only the owner knows where to look to find it or may have to do some deciphering?
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:02:24
Very reasonable post. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ANOTHER DIP don't be the guy buying HARD at the peak and selling on the way down. It's ok to buy in small increments on a weekly basis because you will average out over time, but don't go balls deep at the peak right off the bat. Slow down and be realistic. GREED will be the end of your bitcoin experience. Be safe and do your DD. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:33:56
From what i've heard... the EMP and natural disasters? Still dont seem to be valid because again, why worry about money in times like that? Your surviving and usually have preparations or ur totally fucked in the case of the EMP because ATM's dont work and no one hordes cash at home. Friggen only 10% of the country has 1000$ in their banks accounts anyway...
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:20:11
Exactly, I meant to reference the news anchors talking about the internet in 1995 because they were still questioning what it was, like we saw here. Great news coverage that didn't seem to be biased and where they actually took cryptocurrency seriously. I love it and hope to see more discussions like this regularly.

@_date: 2017-08-14 16:36:51
I have Trezor and have heard that its one of the most secure methods of storing bitcoin. I dont think its a bad idea to decentralize your bitcoin or crypto hodlings incase something does happen to ur Trezor account.

WHAT effect will it have on the market if bitcoin starts getting mined by governments? I would imagine it would further limit the supply making the price go up right? I mean.. WTF would they use it for?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:20:26
lolol tru. How much were you betting I put ~300$ split between the two lost most of it, but had the btc back in my account with in 12 hours...
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:00:10
HAHA I can imagine. My Dad thinks a bitcoin wallet is something you carry around with you. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:01:54
Nothing backs the USD except the fact that we pretty much force the world to use it as the world currency. Volatility is high because people are just beginning to understand what it is. Once it reaches a reasonable price and once enough time has passed to develop proper infrastructure around it you will be asking totally different questions. Either it will become like gold and it will be used to back currencies around the world or it will be its own currency, but it isnt going anywhere any time soon. Why does it matter if the price swings? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:29:31
No matter how experienced you are... price targets do not mean a thing unless everyone else believes it is true. This is why holding will ALWAYS be more profitable than day trading. DONT get greedy with bitcoin (aka day trading) and you will be glad one day when you can pay for your education, purchase a house, buy a car, etc with a few thousand USD you invested 10 years before. Enjoy the ride and remember that one day you wont have to convert your BTC to USD. Moral of the story... bitcoin was created to avoid the douche bags on wall street so why would you listen to anything they have to say about it? They are 100% trying to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:17:19
If you are worried about overpaying for the price of a good then you could always repurchase the value that you spend in BTC and make the money that you would have lost if you just removed that amount. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:21:56
Personally, i'd take some of my BTC profit and slowly buy leap put options against the SPY, DOW, etc. I wouldn't be putting a ton of money into the market now if I were those guys.

I'm curious to see what happens when our stock market sells off where people will choose to put their money. I bet bitcoin gets a decent share. People reference the gold market a lot, but I would be willing to put money (and have)  in the hallmark crypto's. Money probably wont flow out of gold anytime soon because the people that own it are ancient and will more than likely HODL til they die.

DO NOT USE BITFINEX or any exchange utilizing tether. I believe Coinbase to be the best right now. Its not what a lot of people would recommend here, but they seem to be transparent. 
Also, once the transaction on coinbase clears... get a JAXX wallet and transfer your crypto to it (it's important to keep your coin off of an exchange).

@_date: 2017-11-20 17:13:31
Satoshi is not a BCH fan for the simple fact that it would centralize mining. HUGE blocks will be impossible to mine for hobby miners. Once that happens the crypto will become exactly what the banking sector is today, plain and simple. They can fuck around the constituents for changes that favor themselves and the users would have no input. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:29:01
In terms of price, do you think it has the potential to reach the ridiculous estimates of a million dollars per coin? Some people seem to think it's possible.

I did the same. Super sad. I'm going to buy back in as soon It drops to 6K. Already made like 5K this year off of 250$ I put in earlier. I'd be kicking myself in the ass if my didnt take the profits for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:36:08
Because, there is an ongoing issue with a coin called TETHER if you want to research it. Basically, people believe the creators have been using the 100's of millions of dollars invested in them to prop up the price of BTC. Due diligence sir.

@_date: 2017-11-19 02:54:52
That was my thinking. I know it would remove the profitability from mining, but everyone paying a bit more in electricity costs could be a simple solution as to how bitcoin could thrive once they have all been mined.

I would give it a week or so before you invest in bitcoin to be completely honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:07:52
What I'm saying is... there is a lot of fiat in circulation and if bitcoin were to take over 20 years or so from now then 8 trillion is very low compared to the 10.5 T that can be found worldwide today. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:54:06
Try not to use bitfinex if at all possible. I would split your purchases up over a few different exchanges and get your money onto a trezor ASAP
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:06:49
There is no confusion or uncertainty. Bitcoin has had a lot develop over the last year and most of it is good news. Square company is adding a btc feature on their app, which is pretty big news IMO and futures is a whole other story. It's clear that for at leas the next year or so btc will continue to be dominant.

As much as you believe I live under a rock, I think you are naive to believe that BTC is going to lay down and die because BCH has faster transaction speeds ATM.

Troll? I'm not making shit up and i'm not telling people to sell. I'm just saying that we should stay informed about USDT and the effect it could have on new investors. IF (big emphasis on IF) the LARGEST exchange is fraudulent, then how can new investors be expected to trust other exchanges with their money? I'm not suggesting BTC or any coin other than USDT would go to 0, but there would definitely be a slower climb to 500K$ and beyond.

I'm curious about the same thing. Short term it would make sense to use existing technology to get the ecosystem "jump started" until we can integrate layer-2 down the road.

It's a guessing game. A lot can happen in this space within the matter of a month and a half. Be very skeptical of any price targets anyone gives you. Most people are full of shit and even the "professionals" are only 50/50. 10K is possible obviously, but don't expect it and roll with the punch.

It doesn't matter if they ban it. People still use it.

Where could you buy? I want to use some of my profits to get a rig. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:37:56
I did the same! Not sure if i'll have the balls to try that again tho to be honest.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:37:48
I'd say 8 would be healthy... but again this is just a guess. We are definitely over extended right now, but usually when a resistance level is in sight BTC always seems to touch it once or twice before correcting a tad. HODL and you won't have to worry about picking a price. It's only up from here. 10K is nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:41:51
Don't forget about all futures contracts. That was HUUGGEE news. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:53:08
There will be a healthy correction soon. Wait 2-3 weeks and you will get a better price.

Every technology, investment, etc has gone through a boom bust cycle. It does not mean it has no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:45:42
Shit totally read that as 15% faster
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:37:15
I would argue even faster. The tech bubble took about 9 years to develop. Crypto took about a year!

Worse than this, if we don't raise the debt ceiling in a few days ratings firms have stated they will downgrade US debts AGAIN... we have until this Friday to solve the problem or we will see some serious moves in the global stock and debt markets. I'm hoping money flows towards BTC.

This is an article. I'm not sure if Trust Nodes can bet trusted... but if this is true could be great for bitcoin. BUY THE RUMOR sell the news... 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:51:57
Not even decades down the road?
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:57:39
What makes u so sure? (honestly asking not trying to argue)
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:17:32
Sorry, I meant smart fridges not cell phones.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:06:56
I heard you wouldnt.

I'm 3 days into production on Banking on Bitcoin Cash aaaaand its not going so well.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:15:57
You can buy a shopping cart for 20$????
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:32:31
damn which ones? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:57:47
Powerful stuff. I'm by no means an expert and to most would be considered a novice, but we should recognize what just happened.
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:56:01
Would SegWit help with this problem? I'm not in the CS field by so usually all the tech lingo is goes right over my head. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:23:16
I wouldnt. Use Jaxx. You can have it in a wallet with in 15 min and be safe.

I suggest downloading JAXX from 
Set up your account and remember to check all the boxes of the cryptocurrencies you will be putting into the account. You can change this later though.
Keep JAXX opened
* At the top of the app home screen select the coin (BTC/ETH/LTC) you wish to transfer from Coinbase to JAXX
* Copy the "your current bitcoin address" under the currency you wish to move from Coinbase to JAXX
* Hit the triple lines up in the top right hand corner of the app
* Go to tools
* Go to backup wallet
* Go to display backup phrase
* Copy this down!!! YOU NEED TO SAVE IT because:
       * This is what you need to sync your phone, tablet, etc. 
          to your account.
       * This is also your only account recovery mechanism 
         if ur phone and/or computer dies simultaneously. If 
         you don't store this 12 random word phrase you could 
         potentially lose all your coin.
                * Also, don't let anyone else see or know this 
                 phrase. 
Open Coinbase
* Go to Send/Receive 
* Chose the currency you wish to move (make sure its the same currency as the address you chose from JAXX)
* Chose an amount
* Paste the previously copied bitcoin address
* Hit send
Go back to JAXX and literally watch your bitcoins transfer... 
If you use google chrome you can add the JAXX app as a google chrome extension so it sits on your toolbar for easy access.

I dont want to click on any of ur links now. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:22:18
You can trade options on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:50:28
This is the best part of the rollercoaster any way. You get to find out who the pu$$ies are.

Extremely shortened version... There was a scaling issue people didnt think was going be solved before august 1st, but it happened early and 95% + of the miners accepted the update to the system. Not the end of bitcoins problems, but seems to be a unanimously decided step forward.
