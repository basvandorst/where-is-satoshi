How you receive your latest balance from MtGox:
You need the mtgox_balances.csv file from the MtGox leak. Google for it, you will find it.
1. Check your first mail from MtGox that you ever received.
2. There you find a link with your ID (ID=...)
3. Check in the mtgox_balances.csv
You will see at once at which postion you are in the list. That means at which possition your loss is, because the SQL query sorted by BTC balance..
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:45:53
There is no explanation, why their fiat balances are empty. Its on their bank account and thus not stolen.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:56:09
Just one point :)
the price reduction was caused by probably 30.000 bitcoins. If you compare it to the prices, wehn Gox went online 30.000 BTC is not that much.

The remaining question is then: Why is MK not telling ANYTHING! If I would loose 750k BTC from customers for real, I would make everything transparent. If your theory is correct, that the coints are simply stolen, why is MK not just starting to speak??

what is this for a link?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:27:39
its likely that 1.25 million coins are lost (the keys for them), so not unrealistic
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:59:16
More companies accept bitcoin --&gt; higher chance of mass adoption --&gt; More speculators are buying bitcoins --&gt; Price goes up
Quite simple, isn't it?

@_date: 2014-02-16 03:23:34
yes okay, i can agree. but what is the motive of this? why would somebody want to keep the price low for such high costs?
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:56:09
"do you know the website"
made my day XD
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:15:59
But do you really think they can recover from this with fees? I mean they have sold then so many coins so cheap, and this will not be compensated by fee income.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:50:59
That's it! Good explained and clear causal logic.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:19:03
I had like 21 BTc, and sold at 950$. I had an open withdrawl of fiat, but it didn't arrive, so I canceled it to have the possibility to withdrawl BTC, but it was not possible. :( Then I bought in at lower price.. My open withdrawls were like 17500€.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:25:57
And that means "Fck u"?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:53:04
If someone stole these BTCs, why would this person try to spread the BTCs the same way as MtGox did? Its just some immense work for nothing... 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:28:05
Sorry, but it was really not that obvious that Mt Gox lost ALL their coins. Okay, probably it was a risky bet, but would have anybody really thought in the beginning of this year that Mt Gox can really make a lost 750k Bitcoins??

An interesting post in the bitcointalk forum I found:
"Although I haven't got funds  anymore, I'll supply you with some information in order to support anybody who wants to sue mtgox because I'm very interested in seeing Mark Karpeles at court for his actions. lost quiet a bit during the last days when leaving mtgox.
throughout the last week immediately after the first press release of mtgox regarding halted btc withdrawals, you could observe huge rhythmic btc dumps  every 2-5 minutes following always the same pattern ("the whale of mtgox"). the sum of these dumps up to now is approx 140000 btc at an average price of around us$270. ie a us$38 mio sell-off. there were a few stuck levels eg at us$261.24 yesterday and us$148.15 the day before yesterday. these were manipulated levels by the whale serving all asks above these levels every 2-5 minutes. this is very difficult to do through the api of mtgox. but very easy if you're in charge of the order book itself.
Therefore, you'll have to deal with either a very risky investor who is going to sue mtgox as well for his us$38+ mio funds  pretty soon.
if you take into account that most of the trading fees at mtgox were paid in btc throughout the last years (default setting), it is more likely that the whale rushing all the btc on the market is mtgox resp Mark Karpeles himself. This would be an easy way to transfer the customers fiat collected throughout the last years to his own account reducing his liability in € and us$. if you further take into account, that maybe a good portion of btc stored at mtgox got stolen, mtgox might blame the bitcoin protocol ("transaction malleability") as a cause for the loss. the result: Mark Karpeles got the customers fiat, the customers got stolen btc. the customers could file a charge against an unknown person for stealing their btc.
what does this mean? --&gt; all data on the servers of mtgox must be assured immediately in order to investigate the fraud."
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:59:16
OMG so much useful informatin was there :( Make it come online again very soon please!
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:55:11

In the back view it was stupid to have these coins there. But again. Who could really have thought that they can loose so many coins?

There is one theory that this is the planned case.
1. Come up with a bad news story, that provides a lot of attention and fear.
2. Increase peoples awarness about the topic.
3. Extinguish the fears by getting back to normal.
4. People will go on buying and buying.
Was this MtGox's plan?

No, every few minutes!
To your theory: If you check out the order book, you can see that you cannot buy a lot of coins, because it saturates very quickly, so its definitely a loss you would make at the moment.

@_date: 2015-01-06 00:55:28
Well someone could sell tons of bitcoins with rented coins (leverage). Then he drops the price so much and starts this attac. With this panic price would drop, he rebuys the coins and pays them back with a huge profit. Of course it would be risky, buy with enough resources he might manage it.

@_date: 2015-01-06 00:51:10
My theory is that the loss happend not yesterday. It happend earlier and they sold a big amount of coins on other exchanges, as they knew this would be bad news for Bitcoin. They came before the other guys knew it. So this was the reason for the price drop. At the moment bitstamp rebuy their coins with this cheap price. 
Really intelligent guys. Maybe this is the reason, why customer coins are not affected at all. If this is true the price should rebound soonish. :-)

It is still bad news that the biggest Bitcoin exchange has serious problems to find Banking partners. this does not turn into good news, if Bitfinex is not insolvent.

Well it makes a difference is some value increase to a millin a billion or if it doubles if market share is 19 billion. Dont expect 2500 Dollar price this year. 
And always the price hit in the past the old peak in the time afterwards. 2013 peak was 1200 dollar, this price will be definitly hit somewhen again, even if the price increase further.. check the long term chart it seems to be a rule

It is so obvious that the trading is fake. Why this price difference? Sombody just tries to buy more and more and more on Bitfinex, it is some bot pattern, always 2 2 2 2 and then 1 1 1 1 1, big walls of 100 put even if thousand get sold. This is a crazy guy or MtGox will happen again. It was the same before MtGox, the same shit was going on there. Bitfinex might started to speculate with customer funds. Now they state that there is some issue with another company, maybe just an inside fake news in agreement for money. 
I do not trust them, get your funds out.

Poloniex is not trustable for me anymore.
I would even call it a organized scam crime website.
I spend days on this site and had so many moments where it got obious that Polo is doing the lags by themselves as this always happend after drops of ETH, Ripple, Dash etc. I do not have any proof, but I observed the site and markets very intensiveley. 
Indeed I am very very expressed by the trading engine, it is the best available IMHO. But the lags after drops disable the users to trade, while they have time to decide with all hidden market information. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 21:44:36
I have a question to you:
I had a margin position open on Polo and Ripple increased, I tried to cancel it but it was not possible. The whole trading was inaccassible. Due to the increse of price I saw that I have a NEGATIVE Bitcoin balance. The price dropped, trading still not possible. Then strangely the margin engine sold part of my BTC for some price, but later it bought parts back at a higher price. 
The result was that many trades were made not to my advantage. The base value got lower and lower due to this. At some point in time the whole thing got liquiated at I ended with a tiny portion of what I had.
Is it legal that the margin engine sells part of your position and then buys this back at higher price resulting in:
1. More trades = more fees.
2. Decreasing base price.
The whole thing is still fully documented in the trade history.

Hypothetical because all "circulating coins" are not circulating. Take the real coins that are circulating multiply by base price then you have market cap. The rest is speculation.

Some whale bought coins to get rid of the Bitfinex FIAT, people on other exchanges who do not know about the Bitfinex problems buy, because they see big increase. The bigger the gap gets betwenn Bitfinex and other exchanges get, we can expect the more serious problems with Bitfinex are.

Yes, we will but just the time the "crisis" comes, these peaks occur? There is so much you can invest in. I take the profit for now, the price will be dev lower somewhen. I want that price surpoasses 2500 Dollar, as I will get then 100% of my MtGox claim back, but I think we will first have a drop to 1000 at least in the meantime.

The story so far:
March 23rd, people begin reporting delayed withdrawals of USD from finex.
March 31st, Wells Fargo shut down their USD wires to North America from finex's third and final Taiwanese bank, trapping everyone's funds from being able to be withdrawn. Finex starts sending angry letters to Wells Fargo who repeatedly tells them that finex is not their customer and they will only talk to the other banks.
April 3rd, finex joyously announces that they've redeemed all the debt tokens for USD, failing to mention that there was no way to withdraw it.
April 5th, finex files a lawsuit against Wells Fargo claiming that their business was now crippled. They still have not told their customers there is a problem. The hearing is eventually scheduled for the 25th.
April 12th, finex withdraws the lawsuit. They still haven't told their customers there is a problem outside of Reddit and a teamspeak chat.

Read about what happened with mt. gox late 2013. this is a repeat of that.
First their bank screwed them so they had to shut down withdrawals. of course they promised they would fix this soon.
Second the btc price skyrocketed there because btc was the only way to get your money out.
Third they stopped btc withdrawal as well. they claimed that withdrawals would be opened soon.
Fourth people started gambling with goxbtc and real btc on sites like bitcoinbuilder. fortunes were made and lost.
Fifth gox collapses and all those with coins/fiat still left there lose their money.
The bitcoin price collapses and there is a 3 year bear market.
It turned out that gox had been bleeding BTC for years due to theft. They were running a fractional reserve all this time.

But why are people stilll buying in on other exchanges? It is so obvious that there are not many coins left at Bitfinex, but a lot of Fiat thats a lock in. At some point there will be a complete decoupling that means Bitfinex price goes up and the price at other exchnages drop or just stay still.

Well this is such a stuppid coparision, just take Internet Users growth rate and equals this with Bitcoin. 
Internet was and is everything, but Bitcoin is not every digital payment option. The market share of Bitcoin declined over the past month from 85% to 65% alone in the crypto sphere. This is a big risk. We have Ether, paypal, new bank transfer options and much much much more than can take the growth from bitcoin to fulfill what is necessary "digital payment options".

@_date: 2017-04-14 22:22:58
This is what is going on. This is why Finex price is higher than the price on other exchanges. BTC withdrawls still working, the question is how long. If Bitfinex does not come up with a solvency proof this mechanisms will show us within the next month if Finex is solvent. Unfortunatly people have to buy at the overrated prices to get out Fiat funds.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:24:43
Well, I am surly not the first one who noticed this gap. Maybe there is simple explanation like the coins at Chinas exchanges are still frozen. I dont know this, can you tell me?

I am just thinking who is profiting from the lawsuit of Vessenes --&gt; It might be Karples! 
It is not about 75 Million --&gt; It is about the whole surplus.
The longer he delays the process, the bigger the the surplus might become. 
In the end, if shareholders really see money from the surplus, Vessenes lawsuit made this real. He robbed us from getting BITCOINS back - ALL surplus Bitcoins.
Who would profit --&gt; Mark Karples (as he states the law is). 
If Vessenes hates Karples, why would he do this if he has not one chance with his lawsuit? In fact he does a favor for Karples! Both might be just acting in concert, and in the front they do so as they dont like each other. Just thinking about FACTS (bogus lawsuit, delaying just the process), nothing else would make sense.
I dont trust anybody in this MtGox case anymore (especially Karpeles + Vessenes). We know NOTHING! how can this be. I am not sure if I can trust at least the trustee...

Hope it will not go mainstream now. We need more time to fix some issues with BTC (scaling).

An increase to 4000 then a soft correction to 3500 or so and one year at this level would be great. Be patient..

About every hour new problems with Polo:

they were labeled as volunteers. I dont know if they just got anything for their job. I cant believe somebody is doing this without getting paid.

Wonder what's going to happen on Polo that they won't want people talking about. Countless times I've read of people who had their withdrawal from polo not working, and the  tip for those affected was always talk to the mods in the trollbox. This shuts down the possibility to talk to support directly, and also the possibility of the users to talk amongst themselve about those issues.
I've said before that I think that polo is in deep shit, and this is certanly not helping. If I would trade on polo, this is the moment where I'd be really worried about my money. Silencing the people that have problems with the exchange means that you can almost see the fire throu all the smoke.

Sound like a good plan. But when is the best time to cash out? How can you see, if BTC is going to crash?
