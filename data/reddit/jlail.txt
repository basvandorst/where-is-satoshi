I actually had a small realization while buying stuff on TD using BTC...since they are immediately converting BTC to USD, doesn't this just flood the exchange they are using and drive down the value at that exchange due to the influx of BTC to be sold (I am assuming of course that they sell it at the highest current bid price)?
I agree with the acceptance issue, but I want to spend my BTC at a place that will keep the BTC and treat it like the currency it is.  Immediately exchanging for USD will slowly devalue BTC unless more money is invested in BTC.  But if nobody is actually keeping their BTC then the price will continue to drop over time...its a weird cycle that I am curious to see play out.  I am happy with the risk currently, but in the next few months/years I will want to use my BTC at a place that will keep their BTC and possibly even offer the option to their employees to be paid in BTC.  Treating bitcoin as paypal is bad for the currency in the long run imo.

Well if "insider" trading is happening, they will eventually start allowing bitcoin transfers again.  This will drive the price right back up to $500-$600 and will put them on par with other exchanges (most likely).  This will effectively give a 5x ROI for anyone who bought at $100 in the past week or so.  I assume the people who work at Gox sold their bitcoins on the way down and will buy right before transfers are allowed.  
This is what I would do if I knew some inside info.  I had some money tied up on Gox and decided to gamble and hope they will eventually allow btc xfers again.  If not, well I am prepared to lose that money.  It was on Gox so I just considered it forfeit when all of this shit started.
