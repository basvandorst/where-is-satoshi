I could always sell and give you a 10%-20% increase.. just let me know when you’ve got enough
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:21:43
Do you have a link to the full hearing?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:34:53
Spelled, spelt, whats the difference. who cares as long as it’s close..
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:07:18
It’s both.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:20:42
Paper wallet...
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:16:08
When you compare the amount people on this list to the amount of people in the world that will eventually need to hold bitcoin. I don’t find it that concerning. Just tells me this is still very early, that’s if you believe in the technology and not just the price compared to a fiat currency that will be irrelevant eventually anyway. As history proves.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:59:08
Wouldn’t you like to know..
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:14:40
I’d like to think we are heading into optimism..
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:19:04
Because bitcoin is king
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:49:09
All I heard was buy bitcoin..
We don’t trust Facebook..
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:31:27
I guess it’s my fault it’s dropping. My bad..
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:29:05
This needs to be read by everyone on here. Hardly in the news and very well covered up
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:25:52
They’re obviously out there otherwise we wouldn’t be dropping...
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:29:28
This need to be out there. Very well covered up
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:14:33
Shame you didn’t buy a couple of years ago. Sounds like you’ve lost money on btc and not made any. Otherwise why so bitter my friend.. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:24:58
So during the last bear market, Did you dish out the same great advice? You are no investing guru... stop being so bitter “bro” 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:58:31
Bloomberg doesn’t have a chart for that, OP can only reply no to that question sorry.. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:12:45
What what? 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:10:46
do I need to receive the same or will it just send over to lighting? I’ve selected refill lighting and it doesn’t seem to send over. Thanks 
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:30:59
Haha somebody either sold too soon or completely missed out. Don’t be sad.
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:23:35
Sorry I didn’t mean to upset you :)
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:27:43
They are years ahead of many companies. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:19:44
Ohhhh he drew a line. He must be right. 
Definitely didn’t just get lucky and want to brag about it...
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:49:45
Thanks man. How do accept this to my blue wallet? I’ve tried everything. I will try tipping you back when it works. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 14:06:16
This guy was dressed all in black, looked like he walked in off the street. You never know. I’m trying to find the interview to see who the guy was and what he’s doing now. but no luck so far. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:10:56
On the username, do I put my username or yours? Sorry I’m new to all this. Thanks for your help 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:03:57
Why does it take so long to send btc from blue wallet to lighting? Thanks 
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:26:53
Hate to say it but from what I’ve pulled up from the Charts, we have a 30-40% drop due real soon, I guess it depends if you’re a investor or trader. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:09:47
Pump it up please.. ����  long term hold on this. Eddy is doing great work. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:24:02
Thanks, that’s so quick! 
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:33:32
Your magic pen obviously. 
Come on man give me a harder question than that..
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:24:36
Saw a guy on BBC news 5 years ago talking about bitcoin being the future currency. They made him out to be crazy and mocked him because of this is i didn’t buy for a few years, 
they made him look insane and I didn’t take him serious... I learnt to never trust the news but always trust the crazy guy... 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:47:15
I missing the part where you hand out free advice, “because Bloomberg” has a chart saying so “bro”
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:20:10
Thanks man, I’ve set up blue wallet, how do I withdraw in the blue wallet? I will try tipping you back 
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:51:44
Well that depends if you’re investing long term and believe in what bitcoin will become, or day trading to gain fiat. 
Bit silly of you really....
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:00:39
That’s your opinion,  and well done if you do trade it successfully. 
But I’m pretty sure nobody here cares...
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:15:04
Nah I get it, just don’t care to day trade bitcoin. And if I did I wouldn’t post a smug statement saying I told you so., 
learn to humble yourself before bitcoin does it for you...
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:29:04
Silly question. Of course I do, 
it’s a magic line you drew that predicts the future of bitcoin so you can act smug on social media. 
  
And apparently takes away any sense of humour you may of had...
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:04:28
So I’m guessing you’re very rich from the advice of Bloomberg? 
You can’t tell people to sell when clearly you haven’t made a penny from your own advice...
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:05:14
Leave him alone,
 he’s on reddit to trade bitcoin for a REAL asset.
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:03:33
Doesn’t explain why you are here. 
You do know you can’t trade bitcoin on reddit right?
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:04:13
Sorry that was me.... I just bought
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:56:31
Seems like she took a lot of shit for that prediction. Guess she’s the one laughing now
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:55:45
Yeah I apologise for the guy bit I didn’t look at her profile. I can’t edit it, hopefully she sees this and comes back to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:49:33
Yeah i didn’t look at the profile. Either way they get it.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:09:58
Oh that’s weird. Every time I buy it goes down.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:39:31
Haha I wish I knew how to read a chart like him ��
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:06:50
Yeah hopefully she kept believing,  I’m curious as to what she thinks now.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:49:18
I follow a guy called Carl 
[themoon]( 
Great for the facts.
 
I agree,  a lot of idiots on there but this guy is legit.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:36:51
He’s made me a lot of money. I can’t complain.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:13:19
I haven’t gone that far down the rabbit hole, but it’s interesting to look back and see how times and sentiment is changing around bitcoin. From what I can tell this is still very early.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:59:38
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:13:32
Yep. Looks like 8k to me.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:01:48
Yep, would love to know what she thinks now.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:13:24
I agree, That would be the dream, but how can that work when the value of BTC changes. And is so easily converted back for more or less. We need to lose fiat  or completely ignore it all together when comparing it to fiat. It just makes me think it’s still veryyy early days for BTC. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:12:12
Very bitter. Guessing you missed out. Unlucky bud!
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:13:01
You really should educate yourself on the basics of investing before you buy anything.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:22:29
It’s just hard to imagine that someone will pay 1BTC for something that they could of waited let’s say a month, BTC doubles in price. They could of bought two, I just can’t see it being used widespread like we want and need until we lose all other major fiats that we compare it to. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:04:20
That’s a bit clearer. Just trying to picture how it would work long term with out fiat involved. 
May BTC keep growing.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:14:09
No problem, probably one of the best short documentaries I’ve seen on bitcoin! Glad you enjoyed
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:15:57
It would certainly get some headlines if it could be achieved on a big enough scale. A Majority of the community would be able to make this happen. Just need the right person to set it up.
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:59:04
Well I restore buildings for a living, it’s my hobby, income and passion.. It’s just an idea, maybe there is someone out there that will run with it. Obviously not you. That’s fine.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:05:53
Bump and run!! Check it out...
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:06:46
It’s not certain of course. But the signs are there.. bearing in mind we failed one of these in 2014. Can only hope
@_date: 2019-04-09 19:29:46
Eddy travia at Coinsilium doing great work with these guys.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:41:49
That is the the dream �� with everything going on in France at the moment, with the bank runs and so on, this is a perfect opportunity for bitcoin to make a statement. I mean you don’t see banks raising money to help rebuild it. This is the power of the bitcoin community and what It can achieve. And more of course. That’s my vision anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:30:23
Check out the moon. Carl is spot on majority of the time. Very good TA for what it’s worth for BTC. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:54:15
After seeing billionaires donate to have there name go down in history and help, this is bitcoins chance to do exactly the same. 
“Notre dam cathedral rebuilt with the help of bitcoin” perfect headline
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:29:50
Bitcoin is meant to be used. I see a lot of people that only buy to get rich and sell back to fiat. Do what you want with your bitcoin. If you want to donate to a charity. Then go ahead. It’s no different than donating fiat expect it promotes bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:55:23
I agree with you there, the building was a work of art. A masterpiece. It would good if they could build back something nearly as good.
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:53:11
I didn’t realise you were all conspiracy theory nutcases. (Not all of you)  Next you’ll be telling me the earth is flat and the queens a lizard. Sorry for coming up with an idea to help promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:31:55
I’m glad crypto companies are jumping on this, my vision is happening. Forget you moon boys to sell back to fiat.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:24:37
I agree with you there, it could be used for much more important causes, my hobby and is restoring buildings, I was just trying to combine the ideas together. Raise Money for the building and help promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:16:53
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:10:11
Just remember who started this idea ����
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:50:06
What bank was this? 
@_date: 2019-04-09 19:38:13
Where was this spotted?
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:01:50
I have been following rsk for a long time, one company that seems to be going the right way with this is “Coinsilium”. Great company supporting this 
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:39:09
Has any one on here tired bybit?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:22:12
Back up again.
