Did you pay for the stickers with crypto?

No where in my comment did I mention el chapo.

Na. He got what he deserved. You should develop an ice habit or live with someone who has one and then examine your opinion
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:04:00
He tried to organise a hit man to kill his friends and facilitated the destruction of countless lies through his market place that encouraged the sale of hard drugs. Pull your head out of the sand and look at the big picture

They are all equally guilty. The others get off lightly. He is an example of what should happen. He is also a predator who made it easy for people who don’t know better to purchase dangerous and highly  addictive substances. He also allowed the distribution of child pornography. I agree the others should have got the same sentence. Maybe they cut a deal? In the end I don’t feel sorry for him at all. He got what he deserved. 
It seems the crypto world thinks he is hard done by only because he used crypto currency in his market place. I bet if he was a regular old drug dealer or drug deal facilitator no one would give fuck

Poor life choices

Is it run out of mums basement?

Applying for financial  assistance and then spending the money elsewhere is a scumbag move. And fraudulent. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:07:15
Maybe you should pay some tax instead of consuming it
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:25:47
I believe you still are, or are yet to join the workforce. I also believe you have zero investment experience.

Did a bank break into your house with two loans and during the attempt to take your money dropped one which you the picked up and used to buy crypto currency?

Because at the end of the day that money they used was earned by the tax payer. Would you give me 30% of what you earned to spend on whatever I want?
It was for education and if there is a balance left over it should go back into the coffers for the next person that needs it. 
It is far, far from a victimless crime. It hurts everyone including you

Are you still a student?

Absolutely underreported

Two wrongs don’t make a right
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:15:04
If you received the money without earning it and paying a tax on said earnings, you didn’t pay tax, you took someone else’s earnings as your own.

Fuck this bitcoin circle jerk. I am looking  forward to the day it's forgotten about after all the scammers have fucked off with your money
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:20:22
Surely 
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:33:13
You should take some regular to prove your theory
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:32:20
He tried to pay someone to kill somebody else for fucks sake 
Fucking space cadets in this sub
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:53:52
He must be innocent because he used bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:56:01
And the fact that no one has made that much money
