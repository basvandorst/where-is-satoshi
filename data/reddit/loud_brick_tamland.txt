Hey buddy please don't reply to this guy.  You can scroll down and see he is posting every 5 minutes.  I would recommend just downvoting, not because you disagree but because they offer literally nothing to the convo.

Nah he's the pull out king.

I am still rather bullish amd can imagine anything between 50k-100k.  Lowest could be 10k.
I should add that this is based solely off of following the news around it for about 2 years, buying in and out along the way.  I think LN is much needed, and if implemented well will create huge gains around BTC.
Everyone is so worries about BCH right now, and while I applaud their community for trying to male Bitcoin better, i can agree to disagree about their methods.  It was barely ober a month ago I watches BTC go from 8k to 5k and back in a matter of days.  
Edit; my typos make me lool drunk but I'll leave tjem for your entertainment.  Ive always sucked at typing on phones...

This is correcr, but only up to 250k in cash is insured.

Be your own bank.  Buy on coinbase.com and move to a wallet like keepkey or trezor.  You will pay regular fees but in the long run they will be negligible.

That's right.  Buy [this]( and transfer your Bitcoin from Coinbase to the Keepkey.

I'm going to jump on this comment like I jumped on Bitcoin.

THOUGHT about it? Sure, maybe 50% of the demographic, but I only know two people personally who own it, and almost everyone if not EVERYONE has heard of it.

The damn socialists, that's who!
