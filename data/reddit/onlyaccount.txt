And what does that have to do with anything?  The bullish attitude being represented today is nonsensical.

Prepare to be downvoted for making a good point and contributing to the discussion.  If you aren't 100% bullish BTC at all times, you aren't welcome.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:08:30
Man, you are arguing with yourself.  Keep going, your pointless rants are great.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:57:30
Your comparisons to ipmake no sense at all.  Also, you compare to USD, but I can't compare to USD because that isn't fair.  
Where did I ever say anything about selling or banning anything?  To each their own, but people are trying to act like it is a sure bet and are trying to convince people to 'invest' in BTC without understanding the risks.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:15:11
I wasn't the one who brought up the comparison to USD, you did! So you are the one that made an unfair comparison. You see anything that isn't 100% pro BTC as bashing. If you aren't able to take an objective look at things, which clearly you can't like most BTC fanbois, then you are in for a world of hurt eventually.

Nope, I sold at just over $1,000 and moved it back to stocks because the movements and morale got to be nonsensical.  Namely FNMA for a large portion which is up 60%.
Every single one of these exchanges can and probably will steal all of the BTC, just like Gox did, and you have no recourse.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:09:19
Hopefully you didn't trick your family into 'investing' into BTC...
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:37:48
Guess what you get with no regulation?  Well, no regulation, no recourse, and no one that will listen to your 'demands'.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:03:32
But they still were NOWHERE NEAR the insolvency of Mt. Gox... WAMU had hundreds of billions in assets when they failed.  They don't become insolvent when they literally have no money left to pay, the FDIC steps in and takes over long before then.  That is what people trying to say the FDIC doesn't provide any protection because they 'have $25B compared to trillions they are insuring' don't understand.  No bank has ever become insolvent like Mt. Gox did, only ponzi schemes have ratios like that.  Everyone is just taking the BTC exchanges for their word that they aren't headed for mass insolvency.

Whatever man, keep stuffing that sock.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:16:24
So again, there is no comparison at all with their insolvency to any ratio you can pull out of a bank.  Also, Mt. Gox wasn't investing the funds unwisely and got hit by a bad investment, they were literally just stealing everyone's BTC until they couldn't pay up any more. (Or lost them over a period of years for those that believe that) There is absolutely zero comparison in your post that makes financial sense.  They should be compared to Bernie Madoff and other ponzi schemes, not banks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:14:50
It is simply misleading, which was probably your goal.  It is a stretch comparison at best, and not going to make sense to very many people.  Since there were really only 2 actual replies, and both were about it not making sense, I wasn't the only one lost with your point.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:21:13
oooo, burn!
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:06:53
When was the last time someone stole $735 Billion?  Or 7% of the M2 USD money supply.  If that happened, all markets in the world would sure as hell crash.  I have a grip, but nothing you are saying has any logical reason behind it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:28:01
Also, please answer this question with what any of the banks you referenced are at, or any failed banks were at when they failed:


That was your question, not mine.  So that is why I am trying to figure out what comparison you are trying to make....
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:47:04
They aren't analogous at all...When banks failed in 2008 they did NOT have only 7% total assets/liability ratios.  They can fail at very high ratios.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:17:33
I don't even see asset/liability ratio in that first link.  I think you are using the wrong numbers and don't quite understand them...
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:42:54
Your post said "asset/liability ratio", not Basel III.  Wells Fargo's asset/liability ratio is 112.45% for last reported year.  So assuming your post had said:


I would have said:
My banks asset/liability ratio is 112.45% and their Basel III is 8.12%, so clearly that comparison does not make sense.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:34:47
I still don't see your point.  You are trying to compare ratios but you don't have ratios for any banks in your links.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:06:20
You clearly do not have any understanding of investing.

A watch with the wrong time is right twice a day.
