Btcmarkets, Localbitcoins, and Mycelium. I'm also traveling all around Australia and sell bitcoin to anyone who needs it. In Perth right now, be in Melbourne at the end of the month.

I'm already traveling the world. Ledger and Mycelium all the way.

I hate hearing ppl talk that way, makes me feel like bitcoin is priming for a crash. Anything people think is a sure thing turns out a flop.

You literally play bomberman for bitcoin I've made well over $50 worth of bitcoin playing. If you have skills I highly recommend playing. You can play for any amount you want and even free games to get practice in first.

Trezor, ledger or paper wallet

You shouldn't be using Coinbase as a wallet to begin with. Move over to ledger or Trezor. Just use coinbase to purchase coins then convert them to another coin then back to btc over to your address if you want to keep your anonymity

I recently signed up and it said I could deposit bitcoin for cash with them but I can't buy bitcoin with them.

Depends how much your selling. I'd open up a skrill account just to trade if the offers are that good. I do have Neteller too.

That's not arbitrage, that's just regular trading.

Ledger or Trezor depending on your needs

I'll be in Sydney at the end of the month for a couple of days. I can sell you some if you still need it then.

I would continue traveling the world and spreading the truth of our lord savior Bitcoin

You'll never get the exact market rate unless you buy direct from an exchange and even then they still get a percentage. How else would they make any money

I'll tell you what I think about that on Monday

Every time it goes massively up and then crashes it ends up higher then originally. Not only that but it goes up higher and higher each wave. At least according to those charts.

Check on mycelium you will find quite a few people selling in the area.

Cold Storage wallet such as ledger or trezor

Go on Mycelium click buy Bitcoin and look for people in the area.

Been playing this so much. It's awesome, really looking forward to mobile compatibility. I hope more people start playing, so few want to do my 25 - 50 cent games
