You can also use your node as your wallet.  Save your wallet.dat as well which has your private keys.

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:27
I'll be curious if Coinbase says anything about this.  If they were hacked or sold emails to a 3rd party, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:04:08
That could be too.  Will be an issue for years to come.
Did anyone not into cryptocurrency get the email though?

Part of mine is going into Bitcoin.  Just waiting on the damn ACH bank transfer to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:37
Not sure.  Probably depends on the program used to mine.  I never mined any so not 100% on how that process works.

Uh, same.  Just now.  I also have a Coinbase account.

Bitcoin is mined or "created" by computers running a complex algorithm.  Back when it was new in 2009 you could do this on a regular desktop computer.  The algorithm gets harder and harder over time and now you need massive warehouses of tons of systems to do this mining.  There is a finite number of Bitcoins allowed to exist.  You should read the [White Paper.](

Transfer it to GDAX.  It's the "pro" version of Coinbase.  No fee to do this and it's instant.  Then from there you can send it to a wallet without any fee (Coinbase charges a fee).  Send it to a hardware wallet, could be a phone app or a program on your computer.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:54:44
When you buy Bitcoins they have 8 decimal places so $100 USD in Bitcoin is about 0.00600000 BTC.

Just logged into GDAX.  Still asking for my ID verification.  Haven't given them any so far.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:29:04
There is always the chance.  Governments could try to crack down on it.  There is still 100+ years until the last Bitcoin is mined though so to me the price won't stabilize until that happens.

Exchanges won't hamper Bitcoin for goods and services.  Exchanges just change USD or whatever currency to and from Bitcoin.
Once Bitcoin takes hold exchanges won't be necessary.

Pretty easy if you are running Windows.  Just download and install Bitcoin Core.  You need to open port 8333 so your node can accept incoming connections.
You can even run it on a $35 Raspberry Pi but you need a large drive connected to as the whole blockchain is 169GB right now.  Alternatively you can run it pruned so it doesn't take up nearly as much space.  I built an inexpensive, low power AM1 system to run Windows for my node for about $150.

I'm not sure you'll get a little dot on your exact location on the map.  I don't have one because my ISP is out of the major city near me.  I assume the dot is on that city because of that.

The bank is a middleman between you and your fiat money.  An old system that is slow and needs to go.

It might take more confirmations before it appears but the addresses not matching isn't a good sign.  There is malware that pastes a different Bitcoin address out there so make sure you check the address carefully when you paste it.

I was wondering the same thing and why is it listed on bitnodes.  Does bitnodes have all Bitcoin fork nodes too?
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:13:09
Oh.  It might be converting it to a Segwit address.  I think you'll be ok.  Just give it a little more time.
