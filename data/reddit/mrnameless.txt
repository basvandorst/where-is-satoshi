That's silly. You should *never* compound in only one investment. Not Amazon, not Apple, not Bitcoin. The market *will* throw curveballs every now and then and diversifying is the only difference between gambling and investing.

Wow, I've heard it speculated many ways - some I agree with, some I don't. But 'rumor' is probably the *worst* way to say you think Bitcoin will rise.

My honest opinion is it'll hit 6000 then bounce back to about 16000, then fall (while staggering a bit like it is now) to 2000. Then straight to 50k. The markets being manipulated harshly. I've said it since it was rising back to 11k after the initial drop.
I'd sell then buy back at 6. But if you hodl through it all you're not missing anything regardless.

I'm not a doom sayer, and it very *could* just keep going up. But remember, there is ***nothing*** that says it has to. No matter what chart you read, what predictions people spout, what trends look like. Bitcoin has *no* obligation to keep going up, because it isn't really *based* on anything other than what people agree it's worth. 
You can try to predict what people will bet on. But ***ONE DAY*** the market *will* decide that bitcoin has hit its ceiling. 
When that day comes, well nobody knows. It could be now, it could be moon. Just... please don't assume because it has always gone up, it will always continue to do so. Because it won't.
