That's what I'm thinking too...

I intend to take that risk either way. The car was getting sold either way. I just want to simplify the exchanges. Your market predictions are your own opinion, even if they end up being true. And if I sell it, value increases, and I can pay off a chunk of loan money...All the better, but beenie babies are cool too. I know this is a risky investment and would obviously pick a good moment to try and make the exchange happen.

Love it.

Thanks for the encouraging words. Do you have any experience with localbitcoins?

In effect, that is what I gather. I don't believe the figures posted on the site about the future value of co-founder accounts or anything, those look crazy...but what's wrong with a little extra funding each month for almost no real effort after startup? Nothing. At. All. Thanks.

Curious about doing it on localbitcoins

That looked pretty in depth, hopefully he copied the post before it was deleted or that's going to take a while to repost there.

For a different type of exchange though right? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:05:01
This was what I am thinking, and since my intent is not to launder money and only sell my car for a different currency for less than the red flag at 9999 or 10k like the anti - money laundering employees at chase told me they mark for potential closer 
investigation

While that money wouldn't be secured 
at a specific usd amount, isn't it also important to look at the flip side of the exchange value rising if you look where you are in a month or something? The pr for the community is really just a bonus and not at all my goal. I want to sell my car. And I want BTC. Why not simply exchange car for BTC?

What is the purpose of a pledge key that is produced upon pledging? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:56:13
That's the idea I suppose

Audit what?...everything is fine with my taxes so what would they need to know? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:59:47
Also a ok with me. That's the real goal. Not awareness. I guess I'm just trying to think about the reputation, but certainly not first.

What defines a large amount according to the US Government? Is buying 1btc is not safe on localbitcoins? Even in person, with 100% feedback, with cash, in a secure public place with wifi? 
How much is too much if exchanges are done with small time gap in between? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:27:13
That would certainly raise some flags I imagine
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:21:34
Highly doubting that. It's not much money...it's a clean and kindly used car...the title transfer would be appropriate. They aren't going to care about it from how I'm seeing it
