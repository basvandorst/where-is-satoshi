Got an email from Fred. Just like the other reddit thread they are going to take the funds back and give me an additional 50 for my honesty / trouble

welcome to reddit
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:32:50
Well I closed the account as I said earlier. I opened it back up with same credentials and the balance is 0 so that's why I emailed them cuz this is weird and stressful.

Ya true, that's like interest. Bitcoin vendors are basically saying here is some coffee in exchange your you 700% growth currency. I need to open a coffee shop

I'm sorry if that seemed insensitive. I have family in Boston and was just curious to how it might affect the subject of this sub reddit.
