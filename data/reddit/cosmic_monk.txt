It doesn't even cover the power consumption of the computer for the time it takes to collect the tip.

I don't understand your comment.
Most people don't know what bitcoin is. Wariness is to be expected. Why cling to counterproductive rhetoric then?

Does it feel good to be a mean and spiteful person?
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:00:43
That put a huge smile on my face, thank you so much!

Oh! I feel like a stripper, but in a good way! Thank you Five100, that's very very kind.

Please don't take my sentence out of context. I addressed your first comment because it didn't make any sense. Your second comment was about something else entirely.

Today we are seeing a huge change in payment technology, whether it's digital convergence of cryptocurrencies. There's a huge opportunity in Asia, so it's very important for us to look and understand what are the real benefits that are being put into the system by these new technologies. If you are a consumer or a merchant, a government, even a financial services provider, what's really critical is that what you're putting into the marketplace is solving a need for a customer and is trusted. Trust and security, a stable form of value are incredibly critical if you're going to be able to get acceptance for the services that you're looking to provide. The challenge with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is that they're unstable in terms of their intrinsic value, they don't offer perhaps the recourse that consumers are naturally expecting that comes from using cash in the day to day, and they're also there to serve a purpose that's not necessarily completely clear. Let me give you an example: bitcoin and a lot of concerns related to bitcoin are because they are looking to guarantee anonymity, essentially electronic cash if you will. And what Mastercard is critically looking at is: how can we move to this world beyond cash, how do we actually use electronic payments to combat the inefficiencies of cash a really create a more transparent and inclusive financial system. If you really want to do that, it's quite hard to understand what the appeal is of a cryptocurrency, when that currency is really essentially electronifying cash. It seems to be pretty inefficient. Innovation in payments and frankly any industry is critically important to maintaining a healthy competitive environment and driving improvements and experiences for consumers and businesses. Innovation is something critically important to what Mastercard does and Mastercard is particularly focused on ensuring that we're delivering safe, simple, smart solutions to consumers. When we look at the markets across the world, 85% of the world's retail transaction are cash, so what we're trying to ensure is that we are building compelling, interesting, secure and convenient payment solutions that encourage merchants, consumers, governments and other participants in the financial system to move to adopt electronic payments. With a big increase in Internet traffic, convergence with mobile and everything digital, there's huge interest in cryptocurrencies and what perhaps they can create in the marketplace. Now we at Mastercard are not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies, largely because they go against the whole principle that we've established our business on which is really moving to a world beyond cash and ensuring greater transparency and security and simplicity in the way people live their lives. If you think about it, cash is a problem for a number of countries. Cash really facilitates anonymity, it facilitates illegal activity, it facilitates tax avoidance and a range of other things that aren't going to drive an efficiency in economy. Trust is a critical component of any payment system, so if you think about the idea that all of a sudden you're having cryptocurrencies being manufactured if you like on an anonymous computer, in an anonymous location, it's completely legitimate to have some concerns about how that might be working. What a regulator wants to do is ensure that there is a fully compliant root to the transaction. That they understand who is making a transaction, who that payment is being made to and that they have a suitable record, so that they can ensure that there's prudential control over the system. If it's an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction. Why does somebody need to be anonymous? I certainly don't want anybody mining technology or mining financial services away from my control, particularly if they're gonna represent something for me.

This objection has absolutely no merit. The price doesn't matter. People don't have to buy in 1 bitcoin increments.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:08:20
I think they understand bitcoin perfectly, they just don't want the public to understand it.

I saw his right after I submitted mine. Thanks a lot for the silver medal, that's very kind of you. It's my first tip ever.
I suggest you look at both transcriptions, I've seen a few things that he misunderstood. It might have happened to me too.

There are a few effective methods to detect them, the specific gravity test (if done with high precision), using an ultrasonic thickness gauge or drilling, cutting or melting the bar. If you aren't comfortable with bars, you can buy small coins that are too thin to be filled with tungsten.

It doesn't take a genius to understand why historical artifacts are desirable. If they're desirable and rare, they're valuable. Plenty of very valuable artifacts were common at a time. They were so common that everyone threw them away until they became rare. The fact that you can't grasp the historical interest of this newspaper doesn't mean that some people are stupid, it just shows that you have a tiny mind. If bitcoin is still around in 50 years, copies of this newspaper will be in museums.

Using a derisive name for bitcoin is so cringeworthy. It makes me think of these out-of-the-loop grey-haired idiots who call Obama "Obummer" or those who insist on saying his middle name. This thread is idiotic, OP is retarded and the article you linked is ridiculous. Valid criticism should be welcomed and fanboys should be shamed, but the sad, immature and likely pathological behavior of many buttcoiners is much harder to tolerate than the occasional fanboy. You're just so noisy. Everybody sees that you're full of spite and in desperate need for attention, we're waiting for you to grow a bit wiser.

People with fringe ideas, from New Age gurus to conspiracy theorists, tend to overuse this phrase. If you use it, a big chunk of your target audience will more or less subconsciously dismiss you as a nutter and won't give you a chance to present your idea.

You can find that very specific item just as quickly as they can, this service is simply a mutualized shopping assistant who works on commission. It's a service for people who have more money than time or who don't like shopping online.

They should have asked specialists to do their guerilla marketing for them if they're going to make the kind of mistakes the founder just made, but there's no reason to distrust them, their company looks perfectly legit, no one would build such a service just to scam 10 people out of their lunch money. Most marketing strategies use exaggerations or small lies. It's just idiotic to think that you can lie in a popular Reddit thread, there's always someone who will call you out. We even have a subreddit that specializes in calling people out on their lies, /r/quityourbullshit.
