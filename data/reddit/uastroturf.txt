First coherent theory I have heard yet.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:34:48
I thought so too until it didn't happen at $2000, $2200, $2400, etc etc.
Something else must be going on.
Another theory: the SEC decided to reverse the ETF decision (unlikely I know but read on...) and leaked the crap out of it to all their buddies on Wall Street.  They'll announce it publicly when they can't hide it any longer, i.e. when it's been milked as much as possible..

Yeah just make sure you never use UPS or Fedex for shipping.  Always insist on US Postal Service (inside the US).
**Both UPS and Fedex exclude precious metals from their insurance.**
Amagi and all other reputable precious metals dealers buy third-party insurance on shipments sent UPS/Fedex, but it's a real disaster when you actually have to make a claim.  Credit card customers tend to see what a nightmare the paperwork is and just issue a chargeback and let the dealer deal with it (which usually means the dealer gets screwed since the claim requires responses from the recipient).
So it's understandable that the bullion industry is moving away from credit cards, although really I think they ought to move away from UPS and Fedex instead.  It's a game of roulette; 99 times out of 100 no problem, then that one time you lose like $5k worth of metals and have to spend months waiting on hold and filing forms in the vain hope of getting it back.
Anyways, just say "no" to couriers who won't let you buy insurance from them directly.  The blame game is not worth it.

It is a total travesty that mainstream clients do not do this automatically. 
Users should specify their transaction fee in terms of estimated minutes to first confirmation, not BTC, and then confirm that they are willing to pay the corresponding fee.
If the large miners want to start proving their ability to shoulder the burden of client development, they ought to fund a patch adding this feature to Electrum (and maybe BitcoinQT).

This is precisely the situation that the rhetorical question criticizes.


If you're hoping for more than that in a reddit comment you are going to be disappointed, buddy.


The devil is in the details, which never seem to get spelled out.
If it's so obvious, why are there no deployed PoS schemes that use this magic without some additional centralization layer concealing any vulnerabilities?  Centralization bandaids (masternodes, developer block signing, etc) can cover up a lot of ugly stuff for a fairly long time.

Candlestick graphs are stupid for markets that do not have artificial "closing" and "opening" times each day.
If the market is open 24x7 there is no reason to draw the candlestick body, just draw the graph instead -- one point for whatever time and price you felt should be the "open" and another point for whatever you felt ought to be the "close".  The shadow is still useful but you can put shadows on ordinary line graphs.
Candlesticks are obsolete.  They only convey extra information when there is a gap in time where the market is closed.

What?  This is absurd.  Changing wallets will not make your transactions confirm faster.  Changing the transaction fee will.
This is stupid.  Any wallet will let you set any transaction fee you want if you force it.  For a given fee, how fast the transaction confirms has nothing to do with which wallet you used.

Google "child pays for parent".  It works.  Either the sender or the recipient (and usually both -- unless there was exactly zero change) can re-spend the output to themselves with a larger transaction fee.

AML/KYC exchanges are subsidized by the surveillance bankstate.
Actually halfway serious about that (only halfway).
What I am completely serious about is that localbitcoins either works or doesn't work and will not leave you stranded in AML-KYC-purgatory for several weeks at a time (*).  Any exchange with AML-KYC is a big gamble in that respect.
(*) if you are not creating your own listings (i.e. trying to be a professional high-volume localbitcoins trader).  There have been a few situations where the site staff gave them some rough treatment.
