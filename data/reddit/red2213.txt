Incredibly important write-up. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:45:47
4mb blocks are more than safe right now, and LN and sidechains work without segwit, which a lot of people don't even want. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:52:39
You guys really need to start using the animated gifs: 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:38:19
Point of order. His recent agreement is simply not pretty, and does nothing to subvert covert asic boost. His original idea of Segwit soft fork first and blocksize increase in 12 months is something I would most likely get behind though. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:16:08
I used to buy the big blocks are bad fud, but that's all it truly is, fud. I support segwit+2mb/4mb now. If Core wants to push their uasf then I will support fork 4mb without segwit as the majority of the rest of the ecosystem will.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:41:07
Again, the entire community supports bigger blocks except Core and it's followers. Core knows it's just a ruse to try and scare miners into signaling segwit. It won't work. Core needs to compromise or they will be forked out.

I actually signed up because of the capacity issues, but then I started doing research over the last couple days and was astonished what I found and how duped I have been. Here, just a few days ago I was still a mindless brainwashed Core bot too:

Except they will profit immensely off of their payment hubs. Ask yourself why AXA invested 55 million dollars in blockstream if they weren't expecting to make profit. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:43:51
Hello? Are you blind? I just said people want non witness block increase. More people want to increase blocksize than add segshit. You can't hear it in this blockstream echo chamber though.

It's not at all the same increase. You're just drinking LukeJrs kool-aid.

No one said Core isn't talented. People are just saying their interests aren't properly aligned with what's best for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:52:15


That's what you need to get far away from. Taking peoples words. You take Cores word too much. I'm not asking anyone to believe me. Just follow the money trail behind blockstream. This sub and blockstreamcore are the hostile takeover attempt. Way to easy to see if you just open your mind up for one minute.

@_date: 2017-05-26 22:01:44
Yes, they will stop themselves if they try to go uasf. Otherwise they will be forced to increase blocksize to not be forked off into their own blockstream settlement coin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:31:48
We should go for segwit+2mb and just get to $20,000 already.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:42:22


Except there are. I consider anyone trying to subject bitcoin to unnecessary risks to continue using an exploit that gains an unfair advantage over others to be a "bad" party. Activate Segwit via softfork and then there may be little reason for contention.

Any risks have been drastically overstated. A small bump to 2mb or 4mb poses no risk. This is more rhetoric from Core to try and constrict blocksize to 1mb forever. I encourage you to do some more research. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:12:56
We need scaling asap. 4mb increase is not set in stone...although just segwit may end up being that way if Core gets their way. Either way I support segwit+2mb. Also LN and sidechains can function without segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:49:51
Lol I'm not though. I'm just a bitcoiner who wants a good and fair solution to scaling with segwit soft fork 1st priority. I'm for a blocksize increase/solution at some time after that though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:32:38


That's okay. At least they made a proposal. At least they brought it up. At least some action is being taken to raise discussion again. You could argue they are just waiting to hear back from Core side. I see Jihan as wanting to compromise to stop a contentious split, but also wanting assurance that Core is not attempting to stop a blocksize increase forever. Seems totally and completely reasonable.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:39:24

Depends what wallet you used. You can either increase fee, use accelerator, or wait it out. The fees go to the miners.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:38:39


I used to be brainwashed into believing this too, but the more and more I looked into things and did research I discovered that the Core side is the one doing most of the conspiracy pushing. isn't without it's flaws, and when I was duped I thought they were crazy too. Now I can clearly see that is part of the real bitcoin freedom movement. I hope you and others will consider looking deeper as well. It is a truly crazy what is happening.

I'll paste a relevant response I just made to someone here:
I'm not saying Core has the ability to decide, but seeing as they are basically the only major players to not show support for SW+2mb, they likely have the ability to bring consensus by publicly showing support for that or a similar proposal, and of course, the community behind them would show their support as well. But if core side wants to go the more contentious route with UASF that is their choice.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:48:48

@_date: 2017-05-26 18:48:30
The overwhelming support right now is for Segwit+2mb. You won't realize that by staying in a Core controlled echo chamber though. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:58:14
People want to know Core isn't trying to constrict the non witness blocksize forever...because that's what it looks like. If Core wont compromise you will be using a Blockstream alt coin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:09:43
Blocksize increase is faster.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:40:27
Why would it matter who else? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:46:37
Yep, and the fact they now support segwit hardfork exposes their entire scheme.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:42:06


@_date: 2017-05-23 18:19:54
This is a hardfork that activates segwit and 2mb right? Not segwit activated through soft fork first then 2mb later? If so, I don't support this. I would support segwit softfork activation followed by hardfork blocksize increase later though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:04:36


I never said they weren't. I was referring what would be Core members affiliated with Blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:05:09
Because people want confidence that Core isn't trying to keep the blocksize at 1mb (non segwit) forever.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:54:53

@_date: 2017-05-25 20:19:17
Sorry I don't see anything suggesting where blockstream intends to profit other than payment hubs and the like, which small blocks force people onto. It seems as if keeping blocks small is indeed an incentive of blockstream profits. If I am wrong then just tell me....how does blockstream plan to profit for it's investors? That info was not found. Should be a simple 1 sentence answer. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:30:14
Can you answer my question first then maybe I can address your other concerns?
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:22:16
First point of order should be a plan for disabling covert asicboost...if the big block HF crowd even wants to be taken with a shred of seriousness that is. I'm still convinced this is the main reason for the entire roadblock, and if Bitmain didn't have that advantage they would have signaled Segwit long ago. Now Bitmain has strangled the network and is bailing out CEOs of failing bitcoin companies if they agree to his terms that will allow him to continue reaping asicboost benefits. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:20:39
Right...so $4100.

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:09:04
Main concern: does this disable asicboost or no?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:11
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:42:44
Misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:39:01
I'm going to imagine he added those as 2 steps just for clarification. That said, Segwit only removes covert asicboost benefits if it is activated with the soft fork. This is why Bitmain and all of his new partners have been lobbying for Segwit to be added as a hard fork.....the scaling urgency and spam have been used to push an increased blocksize as that reason to do a hardfork. It's extremely important that Segwit is activated first via soft fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:06:40
It makes sense once you figure it out. The Core devs employed by Blockstream are the ones putting us in this scaling stand off and trying to strangle bitcoin. That's all that means...Core devs affiliate with Blockstream...do you have an easier way to write it?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:58:11

I edited it to say "core side" instead of "core" just before you responded. My mistake.


It's not really a lie. Sure there's some other players, but Core is by far the biggest, and most of the other ones would probably follow along Core.

@_date: 2017-05-25 05:21:45

@_date: 2017-05-23 23:35:44
My understanding is only Segwit as soft fork kills asic boost.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:11:32
Simply put, this isn't the last time the bitcoin community will experience hostile attacks, it's not the last time we will hit scaling or development roadblocks. Bitcoin is designed to evolve. Whether that's following Cores path or following something else, Bitcoin will be able to adapt. Maybe there will be a split, but users will always have the last say. Bitcoin forever.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:36:03
We want non witness blocksize increase. Totally different. You people keep embarrassing yourselves. Keep repeating blockstream rhetoric like a robot why don't you all some more?

Yes, but eventually there will be an app for that. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:42:23
I came in looking to support a solution due to these crazy fees. UASF looked intriguing at first, but then I found the real truth, and a better way forward which is segwit+2mb for simply 2mb/4mb sans segwit if Core forks off into blockstreamcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:48:29
How is this proposing the 2nd part be acheived? Or is it?
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:26:22
I mean safe as implemented. Not forced per se, but if capacity ever got overloaded to the point where it would cost unreasonable amounts of money to make a transaction, you would see an increased blocksize even before segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:06:46
Wrong. They would rather subvert and control bitcoin for profit. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:35:41

I used to agree. Sadly, many bitcoiners have been completely duped by Core and Blockstream, including myself. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:52:36


Bitmain side, who wanted large blocks, is willing to compromise by activating segwit for a 2mb block size increase.
Core side, who want segwit, is NOT willing to compromise by adding 2mb block size.
Core side is being stubborn and unwilling to engage in discussion. For them it's get exactly what they want, or try to strangle bitcoin. Core may give in to 2mb, but if not, we can't fork soon enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:41:05

@_date: 2017-05-27 00:00:06
It's not truly "larger blocks". That idea is pushed around by people like Lukejr to muddy blocksize discussions, and was also used to get out of the HK agreement. This is why people are against Core and need to see commitment from them that they aren't attempting what they are being accused of. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:41:49
You could agree to have segwit and a blocksize increase which is superior to just segwit...or go with something highly controversial that could result in a chainsplit...but sadly some of you have been brainwashed to believe the latter is the best route.

Thats a funny theory. Regardless, let's not change the subject. My credibility has nothing to do with the information that everyone has access too, which is that Core is unwillinging to compromise and is purposefully trying to strangle scaling to keep everything off chain to profit off of blockstream payment hubs.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:53:25


It was a farce. It was an increase with added constrictions that still limited bitcoin to 2mb witness and non witness data. Honestly, that was one of the final staws that pushed me to finally accepting the idea that Core is trying to constrict the blocksize forever.

I'm just trying to figure stuff out and learn about everyone involved in bitcoin. I am in no way a shill or troll. Could you please identify what in this you consider to be nonsense, or could you please identify how blockstream intends to profit for its investors?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:03:01
I used to buy this nonsense, until I discovered Cores plan to turn bitcoin into a profitable settlement layer are actually true. Blockstreamcore members have been compromised. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:54:38
I'm not really defending It is toxic, just as this place is toxic. There's a lot more truth and reality there than there is here though.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:26:20
I asked for a source because I've read differently on several occasions. Will take a look at that link. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:51:54
Do the math.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:32:01
You sure?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:42:31
Core refusal to compromise or discuss scaling agreements.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:11:29
Exactly this. And the fact that Core refuses to do such during critical capacity shows they care only for their own self interests and not Bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:02:40
Shitpay has lost my business. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:37:56
Thank you for the response, will be doing more reading. Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:01:37
That's why I said segwit gets activated first.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:29:39
2mb is completely safe. Why not deploy it as well and have twice the capacity and a happy, non divided eco system? It's what compromise is for. Bitmain has met half way with Segwit. Core needs to come now with 2mb. If not, there will be a fork and big blocks will probably win as the bitcoin freedom movement will ramp up to sky high levels at that point exposing blockstream for their deceptive ways. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:32:23
I agree. Get these things done, and I'm 100% okay talking about a blocksize increase on top of Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:23:46
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:27:33
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:03:06
People want to see it. After they used SW capacity increase to get out of the HK agreement they have lost credibility. Core has built itself a poor reputation. People don't want to give them what they want, when they are being greedy and stubborn themselves. There's still many people who do not want segwit that are willing to support it if Core is willing to meet them half way. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:27:07


Most likely scenario is the UASF chain fails, and the bitcoin community embraces a non segwit chain with, say, 4mb blocks. BlockstreamCore and it's brainwashed followers are the only ones that wan't Segwit and no additional block size increases. Get out of the echo chamber and you will see this. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:02:57
Great, thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:57:07
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:08:53
Ha, I wish I got paid. Where can I apply?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:49:46
Since we're talking Monero, I'll take this time to point out why it's not really a great idea to try and bake in anonymity at the protocol level: 


@_date: 2017-05-23 23:46:48
Looks that way. Support Lukes BIP and see what excuses they come up with.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:19:50
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:27:21
Gemini, can link your checking account. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:28:34
Unless you believe blockstream and BU are conspiring together, you seem to be insinuating that BU is pushing sidechains by not allowing segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:31:24
If they don't then they will force a UASF. The fact that "how" is even an
argument shows covert asicboost is highly in play.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:00:09
Asicboost is what is destroying Bitmains incentive to simply support segwit SF. If we go segwit SF he loses asicboost (apparently), but it comes by HF then he gets to keep it. He also wants the price to go up, which it will with segwit, but he wants to have his cake and eat it too.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:56:19
Nothing wrong with a hardfork if most agree. The main concern of people is that Blockstream/Core is trying to keep bitcoin at 1mb forever to profit off of payment hubs...sorry, but I want to be able to trasact or post a message on the blockchain in the future without having to pay a $500 fee. This whole "bitcoin = settlement layer" rhetoric is idiotic and not the original intentions of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:29:21
Use a higher fee for now. If Ethereum had bitcoins use you would have waited much longer. Tx time is not a good argument though. Dogecoin has one minute block time...so is it the best coin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:15:51
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:13:13
My understanding is one hard fork to get segwit and 2mb. We can't do this because of asic boost. We need segwit soft fork first then hard fork. If people oppose the latter then they must be accosted about asic boost.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:39:06
Baseless personal attacks as usual. Sadly I used to be like you too.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:50:47
Are you a parody account?
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:10:26
Eth is a mutable premine bankster scam. Stick to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:08:37
If it's done after a segwit soft fork I do not see the harm in a blocksize increase afterwards at that point. What are the reasons or concerns you have to oppose it?
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:00:48
You need to ask him again if he means segwit first by soft fork. He could easily mean hardfork to get segwit with timed blocksize....and that's what I'm thinking they mean but want confusion. If so, that's a bullshit proposal. Would like to see responses to tweets too. Have you received any answers from anywhere?
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:49:46
What? This is one of the most ignorant things I've ever read. TX capacity is at a critical level. A bump to 4mb would give us 4x the capacity! How do you not understand that? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:24:57
Agreed! Let's use common sense and scale now safely! 4mb blocks is the best route. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:40:01
Or are we about to see the opposite?
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:22:54
Hash power is law.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:20:01
When this sub moves from bitcoin to blocksteamcoin. Good luck with your failed chain while real bitcoiners will finally get to enjoy big blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:05:29
It's disgusting you want to see bitcoin turned into that. Go ahead and do your contentious uasf. It will fail and waste more time. Rest of users not brainwashed by Core and Blockstream will use the new big block chain and bitcoin will be great again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:17:34


Core doesn't run bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:32:38
Sitting in front wearing the hat.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:57:20
His business is strangling bitcoin scaling and spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:24:04
ETC too. I have no idea. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:55:42
You're a bit emotional I can see, but let me just point out that Jihan isn't the only one who favors big blocks. Myself and many people do, and we want confirmation from Core that they are not trying to constrict it forever, because evidence suggests they are. Their refusal to discuss any compromise just adds to the top of that. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:08:31


Yes. Fuck yes. I'm a Core guy but if we can get segwit done by softfork, and increase in blocksize following that we should find a way to get this proposal out asap.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:08:18
I think segwit+2mb is much quicker with an even better result so...
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:58:46
Thanks for proving all my points lmao.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:03:16
It's a great and safe BIP and capacity will get critical at some point if nothing is done. People need to be more open minded, it's true. If capacity ever got so critical we would be forced to emegency hard fork the blocksize anyway...last thing we want.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:14:42
I fully back this proposal.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:50:26


This proposal includes Segwit followed by a 2mb blocksize increase which is effective 8mb max capacity vs 4mb max.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:43:56
Agreed. I fully support this alternate proposal: 
But otherwise UASF will likely be forced.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:36:20
Blindly blaming others won't accomplish anything.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:39:25
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:26:53
1. Is this satire?
2. Isn't Lightning Network possible without Segwit?
3. I'm not buying that about atomic swaps affecting bitcoins network affect
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:04:33
Maybe...but then he's trying to confuse people on purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:17:42
It's a fact. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:24:16
What a troll. Bitmain money must be VERY hard to say no to. Sad.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:33:23
Bitcoin isn't a company. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:20:09
It's true. And it's the only reason they won't support Segwit as a soft fork...because it ends their asic boost forever. All companies, CEOs, and figures backing these HF agreements due to funding of Bitmain will be on the bitcoiner shit list forever once Jihans gig is up. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:35:37
ETH simply lacks fundamentals. It is, by definition, a shitcoin. 
Centralized? Check.
Inflationary? Check. 
Mutable database? Check.
Premine/ICO? Check. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:38:12
Funded by Jihan.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:10:39
You sound lost.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:44:39
Twitter polls are completely accurate and not easily gameable. Definitely.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:55:04
It's obvious trolling...
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:31:40
Activate segwit, activate segwit+2mb, hardfork to just big blocks...just pick one and do it at this point, seriously.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:41:18
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:05:04
No one backing the proposal can even agree on what exactly it is. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:31:26
You've been drinking the kool-aid. The banksters want it constricted into a settlement layer they can profit off of with payment hubs.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:33:10
Well yeah, UASF gets us Segwit in September.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:40:08


Actually, Blockstream/Core is the one single handedly holding back bitcoin, but not to make extra cash now, to hopefully make extra cash in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:47:26
It's your first point that's 100% the problem. It destroys the incentive of doing what's best for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:22:03
He's accepting money to protect Bitmains covert asic boost. Only explanation. We can soft fork in segwit and increase block size after. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:31:39
Is this confirmed?
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:14:27
By the way....can you prove the statement wrong, or no?
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:17:06
I phrased the question poorly.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:39:49
100% happening.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:43:42
How about Core compromises to increase block sizes instead of childishly demanding that people accept their way or nothing? Jihan and Roger have actually come forward trying to compromise. Core has done nothing but sit their stubbornly as bitcoin capacity gets higher and higher. Core is strangling bitcoin on it's own. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:22:17
Yes but no one wants it alone. They want big blocks too. Compromise or end up with blockstream shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:18:43
You're literally a blockstream puppet who repeats their bullshit over and over.
