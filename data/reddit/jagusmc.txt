You just added a word, and clarified your statement!  How wonderful!  You CAN learn!
Remember, WORDS HAVE MEANINGS

No, I was pointing out that your statement was false.
You added the word monetary and made it true.
50 calories has nothing to do with monetary value, but it still has an intrinsic value as food.
In contrast to [your statement,]( which falsely claimed the following:

Words have meanings.
Those meanings do not go away just because people misuse them.
If Latin ist dead, I'm a necrophiliac.

Nope.  Food is worth XYZ calories regardless of your perceptions.  Take your easily falsifiable absolute statements out of your vocabulary and improve the internet!
Words have meanings! Brought to you by my irrepressible urge to yell "Use a dictionary!"
