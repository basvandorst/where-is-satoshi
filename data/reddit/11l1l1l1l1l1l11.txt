Yes, it's a digital commodity that is being monetized. Hence the massive volatility. If it becomes more widely accepted and the price stabilizes it will become a currency.

Bitcoin isn't the type of thing that will get mainstream adoption. My mom found out about bitcoins earlier this year on her own and she doesn't even have a cell phone. Everyone knows about it that just think of it as a fad or a scam. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:55:04
People always try to pin the most random events on bitcoin price. It's always my favorite to find the most absurd. The best one's were during the Cyprus bank bail in and bitcoin had a nice rally. 
Fact of the matter is the bubble is popping. People are looking at their wallets and realizing the 10,000mBTC they have is not going to do them any good. They've seen the media hype up bitcoin over the past few weeks and their cashing out while the money's still good. Maybe they believe in bitcoin and will buy back in when it settles.

Peter Schiff isn't dumb. He has built his career on gold and silver. Bitcoin is something new that competes with the libertarian minded crowd that invest in gold and silver for the same reasons people invest in bitcoin. It's against his interest for him to lose business to bitcoin.

If you didn't expect something like bitcoin to make a 1000% increase in a few months without a correction...Don't worry about it. Don't panic sell. Just hold onto them for 5-10 years or so. Who knows. You're only 17.

The regular speculation and frenzy that happens every 6-10 months. The price skyrockets for a few weeks then falls down only to go back up the next time the media picks it up. Make youre money, but don't get caught up in moment like most people do.

It rose off the media hype over the past 4 weeks. You're crashing because people are starting to realize BTC is currently overvalued. It has nothing to do with china. use whatever scapegoat you want to make yourself feel better though.

Bitcoin dropped 25% in 12 hours **just** the other day, but it's not a bubble? C'mon man. You want to gamble with 40k god bless, but don't blame that on adoption of the protocol and don't act like you're not doing this to have a chance to make a lot of money. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:13:34
Many in the bitcoin community like to try to pin the latest moves on price to current events to try to justify the price movements. You should've seen back earlier this year with cyprus when the price was picking up even though it had NOTHING to do with what was going on in cyprus. The current flavour of the month is BTC in china. Price goes down - it's china. Price goes up - it's china.

You're not. This volatility is what keeps people from wanting to buy into bitcoin and business to use bitcoin. Do I want to accept a currency at my business that can lose 30% of it's value in hours? Fuck no. This kind of activity which is actively promoted here and accepted really is shooting bitcoin in the foot.

Wait. It could hit $300 easily. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:10:04
It'll kill the price. The psycology behind the price now is that there will only be 21m made. I think the price would drop significantly if people realized they were buying 100000 satoshis instead of 1 BTC.
