I transferred 1,5 the other day. I payed max fee = 20$ and got it confirmed in less than 10 mins. Later that same day a did a smaller tx for about 8$. Took 10 mins to get confirmation. 
I don't see any problem unless you want to move less than 100$...  
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:28:01
WHY would you want to pay tax? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:58:45
try other peers. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:42:15
That is absolutely possible. But you don't loose until you realize the loss. I suspect most people would hodl and stash up if prices dropped to 1000$.  
Bitcoins are stored in the public ledger. It is the private key that is stored in your wallet. You can write it down on a piece of paper if you feel more secure saving a physical thing than a digital.

Had 1500... Sold out long in the beginning of the pump... bummer :( But the coin is the banksters coin. They have liquidity ad infinitum. So it could go way higher.

Unless the company sells products for btc... (I get your point. You are right)
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:09:27
The string starting with 1 or 3 should be the address. The other the private key. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:50:21
That is what you get from greed. You don't "get a hang" of crypto by purchasing. You get it by studying. Did you even read how blockchain works? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:06:38
You have addresses and private keys. If you gave your private key to somebody you will have to get it back from that person. There is no way to find out who has your private key if you don't know it.

The fee could be negligible if you had enough time and/or used segwit. You can buy on localbitcoins but using paypal typically costs 30% above market price because of the risk of fraud and chargeback.

@_date: 2018-01-05 10:49:15
You now have a reason to actually read the user agreement... We DON'T want regulation. Regulation is BAD! Government is BAD! How can people not get that? Bitcoin is for anarchy not government loving authoritarian pussies!

@_date: 2017-12-31 19:29:21
I imagine you would have address for savings and one for spending. You would use the one for spending on the LN having channels to different hubs like a business. The point is that if you do a transaction with someone who has an outstanding payment with a business that you have an open channel to the payment would cancel out and not needed to be recorded on the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:27:36
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:55:18
It doesn't really feel like "winning". Thorough research went into Bitcoin before i put money into it. It feels more like "uuuuuh. Were still on track but i might have missed something in my studies that could make the train derail. I could loose everything" As Bitcoin became my biggest savings by far, i got more nervous that the party will one day stop and i will have missed out on a large amount of money. It would take me years to make the same amount of fiat that i could get by selling today. So in short; The happiness is dwarfed by anxiety. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:19:02
no. Governments could not pick up all bitcoins if they where not all for sale.

A blocksize increase would be close to permanent. Permanent changes should only be made with highest precautions and consideration. They should not be made because of fear.

In a deflationary environment people would tend to spend on what was necessary. Inflation promotes spending/consumption. Deflation promotes savings. 
What is causing the earth to collapse? Too much consumption. What is causing economies to fail? Too much spending. 
Bitcoin would not make the world grind to a halt. Merely put a lid on the reckless consumption going on around the world.

@_date: 2018-09-14 19:26:21
There wouldn't be anybody else knowing the private key you get. Addresses and private keys would be generated by software and you would receive a seed or private key through a web browser or mail. 
So A would send 1 btc to an address x, generated by software, and B would send 1 btc to an address z also generated by software. When both transactions has been verified the software will transmit the private key for address z to A and x to B.

Save the private key instead. When you have your private key you can encrypt it yourself using what ever method you like. You can even make your own encryption key. 
Electrum is an SPV wallet. That means that it relies on other full nodes to validate transactions. The only thing the software holds is the private key and no ledger. 
You have the private key, you have your bitcoin.

A fiat currency has value by decree. It has value because you are forced to pay taxes with that currency. Taxes creates a demand that creates value. 
Bitcoin is digital gold in your comparison, but is also cash. To speed things up, a second layer (settlement layer) handles the cashpayments and is backed by btc/digital gold. 
You don't want two chains because you need as high a hashrate as possible on the gold chain. If you don't do second layer, but a separate chain with a separate hash to handle cash payments, you will take hashrate from where it makes most sense and in turn make the network less secure.

I am saying exactly that it SHOULD NOT BE RUN. Nobody knows "how to run it" for everybody's benefit. The monetary system should be a stable and predictable system witch Bitcoin is. The adaptation to different circumstances should happen where they arise. There should not be a group of guys trying to correct and adapt the entire system to trillions of different inputs and consequences because that is utterly impossible. The more centralized a system gets the less ability it has to adapt to changing circumstances. It is the exact same thing with governance. 
This isn't really rocket science you know.

Bitcoin is not and will not be forced onto people like the current monetary system. It will go step by step and expand as long as it is working. I predict it will expand to be the only currency in use. Weather you understand the bitcoin model or not is irrelevant.

Right now stability in purchasing power is not possible with Bitcoin because of the market being too small. The bigger the market cap the more it will take to move the price.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The US dollar has no intrinsic value. Currencies in general has no intrinsic value. Currencies have purchasing power valued in goods and services. 
This is pretty basic economic understanding. 
Inflation is the expansion of the money supply. Without a simultaneous expansion of the market base (products and services being traded) inflation results in a lower purchasing power/rising prices. Deflation is the contraction of the money supply. Bitcoin is inflationary till 2140 and then stationary. Something that the human race has never experienced so we simply don't know the effects it will have if Bitcoin will be the only currency in use.

Don't trust anybody. 
You can create a new private key by flipping a coin 160 times and write down the results in chronological order. 0 for heads, 1 for tails.  You convert the binary result, using some program (search google), into the private hexadecimal key and convert that, using another program, into the public key. No internet connection needed. No wallet software needed. And nobody will ever be able to get your private key as it was never online.

If you have understood the difference between bitcoin and fiat monetary systems, you wouldn't ask whether to buy some or not. You are completely missing the point in making this currency. This projekt is more than just monetary gains for the first adopters. You dont seem to understand that. You seem to only care about gaining more for yourself with as little effort as possible. Otherwise you would simply not ask. And with your defensive attitude you are just coming across as a spoiled kid being offended. I was pointing out, that you should want to want the knowledge rather than the money. Knowledge is not gained by asking what one should do. Knowledge is gained through studying. When you have enough knowledge, opinions does not matter. You will know then what to do.

It is never a good idea just to do what your being told. Or being told what to do.

You have a long way to go;) Reading on reddit does not get you far. There are rules in the coding of bitcoin that prevents more than 21 mill to be created.

The most important feature of bitcoin is not that it appreciate in value over time. It is a more transparent economic system giving people the opportunity to actually UNDERSTAND how monetary systems work by doing their research. This is the revolution of the mind, to set us all free from economic tyranni and slavery. But it will never fulfill that purpose if everybody does like OP. "I dont want to take responsibility. I dont want to spend time researching. Just tell me what to do to make money."

"wow, this really demonstrates a fundamental problem with capitalism and that the working class is being exploited by wealthy property owners."
Nobody said so, because it isn't true. Capitalism is not a game as you might see it as. Capitalism is a natural system because it is voluntary an based on the free exchange of property which is a natural concept observable in many species of animal. Statism is the opposite. Based on the forced exchange of property (e.i. theft) the state is violence and not natural.  
You don't seem to get the fundamentals of why Bitcoin exists. What are you even doing in Bitcoin land?

Because the big players are loading up atm. In a years time the halvening will be a global event followed by millions of people. Why? Today 1800 btc is being minted pr day. They are mostly offloaded onto the markets straight away so the miner can pay the production costs. After the halvening the sell pressure will be 900 btc pr day but the demand will be unchanged. This will inevitably lead to an increase in price. 
So you should do as the big players (and little me), and LOAD UP! BUY THE DIP!

exactly. A transaction is essentially just to update the ledger which is practically energy free. I don't get how people don't understand that.

Unless you are purchasing 0,5 btc or more, you should mind about security later. 
In any case I would advice to practice using 100$ worth or less. When you are comfortable you can purchase more. 
Here is a quick guide: 
1. Download the installer file to a usb.  
 2. install from the usb on a different pc that is offline and preferably has a fresh windows installed. 
 3. Generate an address using the wallet and save the address/write it down. 
 4. encrypt the wallet using a long and complicated passphrase. 
 5. copy the wallet.dat file to a new usb stick.
 6. delete all files on labtop. 
 7. Purchase bitcoins and have them send to your address.

You can mine other coins more profitable that bitcoin. Just exchange the coins to bitcoin. one 12 card rig at the cost of approximately 5000$ will net you 600$ /month  and draw 1300 watts.

Let the wallet reconnect to peers. If peers have a slow upload, your download is irrelevant. You must download from peers with a decent upload.

Yes. Of cause. Its just not a very economical sound argument. Especially when it is your last bitcoin that you are spending on something cheap.

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:45:25
you are not guarantied that the price will keep going up. We are in high seas right now. A correction is possible. So you might stand to make money if you sell now. But if the price goes down and stays down for a couple of years, you will have a problem... right?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:38:14
why would i not make the claim with the premise of optimized settings? You assume that beginners will not optimize their rigs. That is a dumb assumption. "I would like to mine. Plz give me the worst possible outcome as that is what i am aiming for" Does that make sense?

Bitcoin is supposed to be trustles. I guess that is impossible. To remove the need for trust. 
"8MB is too much according to a Cornell study, but blocksize was recently increased from 1 to 4MB (it also fixed a bug and total gain was therefore somewhat less)." I don't understand this. Try in german.

You can somehow repost your tx. Some wallets have the option to cancel an unconfirmed tx. Otherwise it shold get dropped from the mempool after a while. Don't know how long though. But you will be fine though. The money is not lost. Tx is just waiting in line. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:30:09
It differs from tx to tx...
@_date: 2019-02-25 09:03:01
It seems you don't fully understand how Bitcoin works and what double spending is in that regards. 
You don't send Bitcoin to a wallet. You update the ledger with your information. The wallet is just a piece of software that handles the ledger and helps you update it. 
If you transmit two updates with the same utxo only the first one will be recognized by the network (unless you use RBF). In order for you to force the network to recognize your double spending, you must first be able to mine an orphaning chain and mine more blocks than the ones mining the main chain. When you have the longest chain you broadcast it to the rest of the network overriding their chain. 
This does not necessarily require 51% of the network, but it takes A LOT of hashing power. 
As a regular user, you really don't need to worry about double spending. When your transaction is in the mempool you are safe. No confirmation is actually required.

@_date: 2017-11-13 12:04:12
Bigger blocks take longer to propagate through the network. This gives big miners an advantage as they have a greater chance at solving a block. When a block is found the winner starts mining the next block, while others mine the old block until they are given notice that the block was found. This time is wasted mining for those mining the old block. Bigger miners will spend disproportionately less time  "wastemining" than small miners.

The recovery phrase is a way to encrypt your private key. I would always recommend to store your keys locally. You can encrypt them locally using the same method and just store your 12 word seedphrase if you think that is easier.

You are welcome. 
The only piece of data you need to hold on to is the public and private key. If you use a webwallet you will store that data on a remote server, and you would need the server owners permission to acces it. 
The dataset is 256 bit about 2x26 characters so it can be written on a piece of paper. 
You can also store the dataset on your local hdd. A wallet will do that and give you the option to encrypt the dataset.

In a deflationary environment, people only spend what they have to. Given that most bitcoiners dont get payed in bitcoins, buying bitcoin is an investment to most. They do not spend it on everyday stuff, since they could end up having spent twice the work on the same reward.

If you want to store the private key yourself, you usually do it with a wallet. A wallet is a software program that encrypts your key. 
You can also write the key on a piece of paper and hide it in a maddress or something.

What is the difference between crypto anarchy and real anarchy? Please define both terms. 
The amount of times people have pointet to the "problem" you are talking about is countless. Yet still more and more people are adopting and using bitcoin. How do you think that is? 
Instead of you thinking you are so brilliant and on to something big "this is a hard problem that is not solvable" (stupid retard socialist), try to go study some more on the subject of monetary systems and money. You are seriously laughable my retarded friend because your "problem" is non existing. At this point in time, price stability is not a goal to strive for. Go study to find out why.
At this point in time, Bitcoin is not a project for you. You are simply to bad informed to be in this "game" and you don't have the will to be wiser.

Its about regulations. Institutions (pensionfunds, retirement funds etc) are prohibited from investing in unregulated markets.

Download a wallet, e.g. electrum, and withdraw your bitcoin from bitstamp to the address created by the wallet. You now have an address with a corresponding private key (acces code) saved in a file called wallet.dat. 
The only two things needed to store are the address and the private key. This is just a series of letters and numbers and you can therefor store them in what ever way you store other numbers and digits. On paper, digitally, by memory and so on.

Running a node will not make you any money. Mining will, and that is not feasible on an old laptop. 
You can make money on proof of stake networks with an old laptop, but that will require additional investment and there is a risk of loosing that investment involved too. 
In short; you can download a wallet and run a full node to support the network, but it will be at your expense. You cannot make any money with your laptop.

You dont NEED a seed phrase. You NEED the private key. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:56:54
You seriously don't know what you are talking about. You lack knowledge so you are afraid. Thats pretty typical human behavior. 
Bitcoin is open source, and you simply cannot have all the private keys. Its mathematics and you and everybody else can scrutinize it every second of the day. So far, the private key encryption has been unhackable, and a pretty large reward has been put on the line to accomplish it. 
You should look into your objections to see if they are valid or not. Millions of people are actually spending a great deal of time working on Bitcoin and billions and billions of dollars have been invested. Whatever flaw you think of, there is a good chance that another has already thought of it and an answer has been provided. An answer that was sufficient for intelligent people to keep investing.

My point is, if you have the private key, you have your bitcoin. You don't need a seed phrase for that. So the statement "If you don't have a seed phrase you don't control your bitcoin" is not correct. 
"If you don't have a private key you don't control your bitcoin" is correct.

Coinbase is not a bank. I know how fractional reserve banking works. 
When you deposit Bitcoin into the bank, you can follow them all the way. If the bank tries to create bitcoin, it would be revealed as soon as i tried to spent the fake bitcoin. 
Coinbase is a different environment, as the tokens that you receive is only to be spend on the coinbase platform. So it is a closed system isolated from the bitcoin network. In that case it would be possible to create IOU's without backing because they would be accepted by the immediate receiver when i spend them on the platform. 
In the real world, Bitcoin would be deposited into a bank account (the banks bitcoin address for your deposit) and when you withdraw you would immediately control for authenticity as fake bitcoins would not be accepted by the network. 
With Bitcoin, a bank would not be able to practice fractional reserve lending.

looks like you are late for the party. Or Bitcoin is simply not for you. 
I have been using Bitcoin for 6+ years and it has been the same with every transaction i have made. 
If you heard about it when i did, you would probably not have thought anything big of it as you don't see the value in decentralization. 
I saw the idea right away and did not hesitate to buy Bitcoin. But I am also an anarchist so I see decentralization of money as having the potential to free all humanity from the shackles of government. 
I became fairly wealthy by doing this, and even though my fortune has shrunk during the last year i really don't see the problem when you have my kind of mindset. To me it is not about the money. Its about liberty.
When i got into Bitcoin, everybody had the same mindset. They all believed in decentralization, and they all got rewarded for this. 
If you are considering to buy Bitcoin, and don't want to risk a heart attack, I suggest you read up on the subject of centralization vs decentralization. 
(This space has been invaded by socialist retards that don't appreciate the fundamental offer Bitcoin is making; Freedom. I hope you are not one of them. Socialism is the biggest threat to Bitcoin and humanity. )

It makes no sense to talk about "the value of a dollar". Fiat has no value. Fiat has purchasing power. Inflation (money printing) causes the purchasing power to diminish over time. If you kept dollars through the 2008 crash you have not lost any value no, but you did loose purchasing power (perhaps).

The wallet is a full node if you have a full copy of the ledger. For instance Bitcoin core wallet is a full node wallet. It automatically downloads the entire blockchain. And it automatically verifies your transactions against that copy. So by having a full node you (your wallet) verify your own transactions.  
If you download an spv wallet, the spv wallet verifies your transactions against somebody else's copy of the blockchain. The spv wallet could not function on its own. Your full node can. 
Spv wallets could be electrum or samurai.

Only one fee will ever be paid. Fees are paid as x amount of btc per byte of blockspace required. 
You can see here what fees are in the mempool right now. [
If you want to be sure to be among the first transactions to get included in a block you pay a fee of 500 sat/byte. 
If you are not in a hurry and can wait up to 24 hours, you can do with a fee of 1-2 sat/byte. 
You should be able to set the fee in electrum. In v3.1.2 you can set a target but not a specific fee.

The system is made by cheaters and for cheaters, so the way you are supposed to get ahead is by cheating the system. Do you have insurance? If so, do some cheating with that and get some money to invest. After all you have got more responsibility towards your family than som rich fucker owning stocks in insurance companies.
Forget about honesty. Think about your family. That is what the other fuckers do.... Egotistic fucking cunts. The same cunts who gave you a student loan. Dont pay them back! Fuck them! Use the money you should have paid them to invest in some thing with a nice return. It could be crypto. Or do a fast drug turnover (100 g's of coke can return 300% your investment in a short period of time.).  There are plenty of dishonest ways to get a heads start and not a lot of honest ways.

@_date: 2018-07-24 08:12:39
the wallet.dat file is just a file containing your private keys. Its like a text file. A private key is a string of numbers and letters and is required to transfer funds from an address. 
e.g. E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389 
When you make a transaction you create a file (/your wallet creates a file) containing the address from where you want to transfer from and the address you want to send to. To validate your right to transfer from your address the private key is included in the file that you transmit to the other nodes in the network. 
Now your transaction is part of the mempool and will be included in the blockchain as soon as a miner finds a block.  
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:18:25
People don't understand money. To most people inflation is rising prices and not an expansion of the money supply. So they will not get the message...

Thinking that the whole world has classified money according to what YOU use in your daily life is,,, I lack the words here. Its beyond stupid. Its like, moronic. 
So money is defined as "whatever you use to buy groceries."?! Wtf.

@_date: 2018-04-27 20:49:13
I see where you are getting at. 
BCH was indeed the hardfork. Though a hardfork does not imply a new coin. Bitcoin has hardforked before. So following that rule strictly would mean that bitcoin isn't even bitcoin. 
So it comes down to the majority rule witch is not a technical feature. 
The same was shown with the split of ethereum and ethereum classic. Ethereum got to keep the name only because the majority voted for the fork. 
Bitcoin seems to have no definition. It seems to be a word that describes a cryptographic decentralized payment network. Like most other coins. 
IF Bitcoin is the one with the longest chain and most accumulated proof of work (and i think it should be) one must be ready to call a different coin Bitcoin. 
The name of the coin is after all only important because most people are idiots... What has relevance is the properties and future implications.
Fyi i am a fan of btc. I only hold btc (since 2013). But more than a fan of the Bitcoin name i am a fan of the prospects.

If people say that, they don't know what they are talking about. 
You should anyways care less about what other thinks. Bitcoin is not a mission to convert people. It is an offer they can take or leave. If you take the offer, explain why, but don't try to turn anybody over as it is a waste of time. 
Most people are afraid of new things. It is a human thing. You are rarely able to rationalize with those who are guided by fear. When they have heard the word Bitcoin enough times to be familiar with it, their fear will vanish and they will see the light. They will never understand as that is not how they work. They will only be familiar, and that is good enough for them.

We know how to define apples and oranges. Claiming something is an orange, even though it falls out of the definition of orange, is fraudulent. 
Without a definition we cannot claim something is fraudulent. On what basis? 
You can do the same with "god". Lots of people claiming to know god, but none has a clear definition therefor nobody is wrong or fraudulent.

You don't need any confirmations. With 0 confirmations the chances of your second tx being declined by the network is bigger though. 2. tx will only be approved if the majority of chains contain the first tx. 
Making a tx is like sending a mail. You can send the mail regardless of confirmations. 
f you want a higher probability of the 2. tx to be confirmed you pay a high fee on the first tx and a low on the second. Thereby the first tx will be included in a block before the second.

I don't think that you are contribute a hole lot by spending bitcoin on goods and services right now. What is needed for bitcoin to be functional as money is adoption. People need an incentive to adopt bitcoin. That incentive is as a store of value. You don't adopt bitcoin because you can spend it on goods and services. You can do that with fiat. The incentive is in the store of value part. To contribute to bitcoin as a store of value, would require from you to hodl, not to spend.

@_date: 2018-12-17 14:40:25

Doing a transaction on the bitcoin network is essentially just notifying the other nodes/participants the change that you make in the ledger. If you include your private key the other nodes will accept the updated ledger. 
When you do a tranaction, using electrum, Electrum creates a notification with your private key and the change you are making in the ledger and transmits it to the other nodes.

You have to explain the reason to hold bitcoin in the first place. As a hedge against national currencies and as a speculative asset (Because fiat credit based systems will self destruct and become worthless). As fiat systems goes bust more and more people will turn to bitcoin as a store of value. When enough people use it as a store of value, the price will stabilize and people will start using it for commerce.

Sure. The point is that IF you want to help bitcoin adoption, you would do the most by hodling.

Why would you hold fiat?

Study some market mechanics, you will see. Its self evident.

Sure. But right now ; Dont spend, HODL! When prices stabilize you can spend. Until then, just hodl.

Adoption is not equal to use. Purchase of Bitcoin=adoption. 
In order for Bitcoin to be a efficient and usable means of exchange, it must be stable. An apple needs to cost the same (roughly) today as next year. In order for Bitcoin to become stable it needs volume. The higher the price of a bitcoin the higher the volume and the more stable the price will be. If you want to contribute to higher prices, you buy and hodl. In this way you will lower the supply and the price will go up. 
Satoshi did not need to write this in the whitepaper, as it self evident.

Lightning network is a sidechain. It is not a part of bitcoin per se. The lightning code is not implemented into the bitcoin source code but runs separate. It uses bitcoin as an input, but could also (and will do so) work with other chains as input.

Debt cannot be converted to another currency unless you agree to it. If the dollar becomes worthless, so does your dollar denominated debt.

Buy and hodl. Spend when stable.

sure. But you want to hold the most deflationary currency the longest time. You will trade them when you need to.
