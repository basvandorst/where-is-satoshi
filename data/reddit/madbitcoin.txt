just in case anyone's curious, and because i don't want them to feel left out: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:57
haha, cheers!

time will certainly tell. already a couple of btc orders. feels pretty damn cool to sell something for coin, like a legit economy really can emerge from this thing. thanks for the support!

prove me wrong! :) note that i claimed first in the US, i'm aware that a Canadian winery beat us to the punch for North America.  cheers!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:41
ha! i like it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:00:18
alas... damn blue laws!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:59:56
stay tuned! our first reds set to release by june 1!

again, this comes back to perception, and one's feelings towards the long-term viability of bitcoin. as to transactions on the site, though, the price adjusts along with mtgox. it would have been difficult to realize an "instant 50% loss," even today.
if there is a perception, though, that orders have been flooding in today due to front page exposure on the bitcoin subreddit, please allow me to set the record straight... this is reddit we're talking about after all. most incoming orders have been fake... classic.

Nice, we've got distribution in CO, actually. I was out there last year to work with those guys and to attend Club W's first event.
Tried some CO wine while I was out there, too:  - good stuff!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:32:47
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:45:38
haha, would probably cost 1+ btc for shipping, unfortunately. no distribution abroad yet...
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:13
lol, i suppose that would depend upon one's perspective, wouldn't it? i'm feeling fine, thanks.

yeah, absolutely, where are you based?

I hear ya, shipping wine is expensive. Lots of laws and regulations, not to mention the stuff is heavy. When you see wine elsewhere with free or cheap shipping, it's either priced into the wine, or the wine is past due and they just need to get rid of it. The myth of "free shipping" is a powerful one, though, to be sure.
