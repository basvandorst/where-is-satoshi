I am utterly tired of people bashing web programmers. A competent web programmer would most definitely know SQL, where locking is a core concept. 
Sure, there are good and bad professionals in every field, but I rarely see web programmers giving the sh*t for systems programmers as a whole for all the horrid 3^rd party device drivers we had in Win95. ;P

So apparently the author of Bitcoin does not know how to unsubscribe from a mailing list? Interesting..

This is pretty fair opinion. Building your blog on PHP might be a good idea, but using it to run a financial exchange with several million dollar volume turnover is likely to result in a total catastrophe.

Yeah though I do agree people should hear some of her side as well even if they don't like her.

I don't find this that significant. Once you are discussing Hashcash and how to turn it into an actual currency you pretty fast come up with some system of this kind. What is missing are the crucial details specific to Bitcoin, like the blockchain and the mining system (the guys are discussing a "mint" in the emails, which sounds like a central authority).

Some of her points:
* Satoshi Nakamoto did not want to be completely anonymous because he chose to post hundreds of messages on Bitcoin forums under his own real name.
* She only published the names of those family members that she interviewed.
* When asked what she would have changed about the article, she said they agreed to blur the license plate but forgot in an "oversight".

Relevant transcript:
**Pam**: Krieger's selling the cocaine online.  
**Malory**: Are you insane?  
**Dr. Krieger**: Yeah, if it's insane to use an X-gen asymmetric onion router and digital cryptocurrency to sell your cocaine anonymously and completely risk free.  
**Malory**: But.. do people email you, or ..?  
**Krieger**: No! It's like shopping online, only for cocaine. I've already sold .. (*dabbles computer*) whoa, almost 800 grand worth!  
**Malory**: Really? But how do we get paid?  
**Krieger**: With a totally untraceable digital currency that we can exchange for real US dollars whenever we want. (*Sips coffee*) I call them: Kriegerands!
