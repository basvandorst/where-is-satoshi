No one cares about ETF tied to futures. The VanEck ETF is the only one that matters right now.

I’d disagree that it’s completely useless. It’s a step toward mass adoption IMO. It validates it as a major asset class. Your average joe is going to shy away from bitcoin and any other crypto as long as there is no validation from large agencies or institutional investors. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:53:25
It’s a futures backed ETF. It’s going to be denied. This isn’t really the one the market is looking for anyways. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 12:10:04
Welcome to the thread captain obvious.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:11:49
I think the market would disagree with that.
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:10:05
I fail to see how bitcoin could be a good things for governments if they can’t “print” more. They wouldn’t be able to fund, well most anything. Especially wars. They took us off the gold standard, why would they essentially want to go back to it?
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:46:16
To make such a naive statement you can’t understand the term “market”. If there is no demand (buyers) then yes, the market killed it. And this doesn’t have to be buyers in terms of USD on exchanges. This could mean people willing to accept BTC for goods or services, which would be even more detrimental.

Unless there is a complete financial collapse there isn’t a need for crypto in this space as long as payment services are pivoting jn the right direction to offer services such as this. Your average Joe doesn’t care about decentralization. All they care about is a product or service that is easy to use and works. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:54:04
Well I was going to try to justify the extra cost due to no KYC, but you’ve cleared the air on that. Will never use one of these. EVER. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:45:25
Am I looking at this right? $1,300 over spot?
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:46:22
Do you talk about these things to friends, family, people at work? You probably just circle jerk with people on Reddit about it and have no perception of what the average person thinks about this. Not to mention how little of it they actually understand. I asked a simple question to promote discussion and you decide to try to attack me rather than offer anything of substance. Good day, Mr. Troll.

What do you think day traders use? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:40:30
BTC is becoming highly centralized as well
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:03:28
I wanted to but couldn't figure out how.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:49:44
The way you describe it sounds coordinated. Which means manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:53:04
Even that doesn’t look promising at the moment
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:42:29
Didn’t Coinbase send them a cease and desist letter?
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:20:52
While this will give an injection of new money, I fail to see how paper Bitcoin is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:29:24
I’m not saying the orders are fake. I’m saying they are coordinated for just the exact purpose you described.
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:53:44
I agree. It would be like the USD being pegged to gold. Lock up all the gold in Fort Knox. Tether needs a Fort Knox for USD.
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:29:34
Looks like manipulation to me. It happens over and over again. Extreme large spikes of volume out of nowhere. Then back to where it was with extremely low relative volume. Strange to say the least.
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:43:33
I thought it was the search for keywords? In this case “bitcoin”. I could be wrong but this graph doesn’t have to do with press coverage?
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:36:23
Hey only 9 years and 13 weeks behind. Better late than never!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:57:57
What is your definition of market cap? I don’t see how it can be higher now than when it was at 20k?
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:50:04
I see your point, but google is not reporting on press coverage with their trend graph.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:38:23
Actually Euros and Rupies are compared to USD. I do care, and so do many others. A dollar is a dollar because it is the reserve currency of the world.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:36:34
Let's say you are using BTC, well your purchasing power is deteriorating by the day. That is definitely a concern.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:34:37
To be clear Bitcoin is NOT an investment. It is purely speculative. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:43:21
I never said I didn’t like it, to the contrary actually. I just don’t believe in misleading someone to profit for myself.
Since we are using wiki here’s a link for you. I would argue that this is much more closely related to bitcoin and crypto in general.
Again, just because I’m realistic about it doesn’t mean I don’t like it. My portfolio proves otherwise. 
[speculation]( 
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:39:39
Bitcoin, IMO represents the inflation of the dollar. And I think that is what OP is trying to say. BTC going to 18k would mean the buying power of the dollar has decreased. INFLATION. I think you are missing OP's point.
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:10:39
Bitcoin is the most traceable form of currency ever invented, even though it was meant to be just the opposite. If you mine it and send it from your wallet to someone else’s wallet, much harder to trace. However, if you are like the majority of people who purchase from an exchange with KYC, kiss your anonymity goodbye. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:01:49
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:11:11
Not really. I mean If it’s fact based asking someone the answer is one thing. When it’s opinion based, and you’ve already stated it seems to be 50/50 why come to a biased forum and ask the same question again? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:07:41
Well you come to a bitcoin subreddit, what answer do you think you are going to get here? The key is to research and decide for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 22:23:09
And obviously this guy said he had 1300 left in his paypal and asked should he put it all in bitcoin. Doesn’t sound like a 1% “investment” to me. So I think you kind of proved my point in this particular situation.  
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:02:27
I mean laugh and downvote all you want, but it doesn’t change facts. And it’s wrong to suggest otherwise to someone who clearly isn’t familiar with the space. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:41:05
Well this isn’t a party and it’s people’ real money we are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:15:36
Americans are dumb as shit (I am one, I should know) and they will probably never touch Bitcoin (or any other crypto) until the rest of the world has adopted it and is leaving them all behind. We live in the country that has the world reserve currency, and no one sees how it can fail. No one understands money in this country. We just consume, consume, consume.

The buyer also needs to mitigate risk in already volatile market. As soon as they purchase 1 BTC from you they are already at approx. 30% loss. No thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:52:02
I really hate the “oh the market is so HUGE and if we only capture this small percentage (or all of it) we’ll have THIS much growth!!” It’s an amateur argument that means absolutely NOTHING. Startups try to use this all the time when pitching ideas when they have nothing else to fall back on.
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:07:59
Not sure if serious
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:16:48
The market says you are 100% wrong. You are one person who thinks it should be $8. Put in a limit order and see if it ever gets filled. You talk about it being "too expensive" and we need a "fair" price, but the market is already determining what "expensive" and "fair price means." At this moment $8500 is a fair price. Sounds like you want some central authority to control the price of BTC so that is is more palatable, which is completely antithetical to what BTC stands for.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:46:08
I'm a fellow mississippian, so this is cool to see. Hardly anyone around here knows what it is, and especially doesn’t know how it works. Great to see inroads are being made.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:18:43
Probably like most places that actually “accept” bitcoin, they would use a payments processor that automatically converts BTC to USD upon checkout.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:46:37
Set the amount of BTC you want to buy. (.001). The LIMIT PRICE must be the TRADE PRICE you want this to trigger at (price of 1 BTC). Below that the "total GBP" will automatically calculate, giving you the actually cost of .001 BTC at x GBP trade price.
The reason you are getting invalid is because with the way you have it input you are essentially saying you want to buy .001 BTC when the trade price of 1 BTC hits 3.00GBP, which would cost you .003 GBP, which is an invalid denomination for GBP, not to mention this is so far off the current price your buy would never trigger anyways.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:54:49
Exactly. The trade will trigger whenever the actual TRADE PRICE hits your LIMIT price. if you click the "advanced" tab underneath "limit price" it will give you different "time in force" policies. 
Here is a link to the fee schedules 
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:04:35
Limit price must be the "trade price". 
EDIT: Looks are you trying to BUY BTC not SELL BTC which is what you are wanting to do according to your post....
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:28:35
No problem, glad I could help. Also when SELLING you follow these exact same principles. The only change is at the bottom you'll see "total GBP". This will be the amount of GBP you will receive for selling BTC at whichever limit price you set that at. So in your case if you want to receive 3GBP by selling .001BTC your limit price would need to be 3000. (3/.001) Which is far off from where it is currently trading.
