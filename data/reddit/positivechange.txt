No direct ban but 1000 other financial ways to discourage from using it. Simple one - buy BTC with printed money and then make crazy dumps. People got discouraged as they lose money. Governments have cash and can play pump and dump, combine it with propaganda, centralised services, altcoins and you see slowdown in adoption.

Somebody ELI5: is it possible to use another crypto for change tip or bitcoin is the only option? It's not that I care to much (long on bitcoin) but wondering why people don't use I. e. Dogecoin. Sending somebody 10 000 doge seem more fun than sending 0.00001btc. Yes /No? :)

No, its not good from bitcoin because:
1) money leaves original BTC
2) people are confused
3) exchanges are confused
4) it costs tech innovation and adoption 
The only winners are creators of the altcoin. They basically create altcoin for free, then get some miners,  bunch of cheap nodes from Amazon cloud and then marketing - loads of marketing. Tadaaaa - wait a little bit and shit-coin starts selling for thousands of $$$. Thats unfair game, stay away from alt-coins.

There are not that many low earners left in the world. And for many of that kind of people money isnt really needed . I probably got a bit of brainwashed after traveling in Africa and seing people not keeping money in the bank (for mere 1% of interest) but buying cattle that will give birth to a babies and that way generate at least 25% interest per year. In that places one is often allright - fed, smiling, easy life... But no cash.

They wont lose. In a long term any alt-coin with strong whale support raises and gets stronger. Thats reality. One might win the battle but its really hard to win the war...

Nice one! Thanks for helping Bitcoin community!! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:36:17
Just like other apps/protocols online  - popular ones doesnt mean they're better ones. They just came first, got the user base and started to expand. Take for instance TCP/IP protocol - the are many protocols that do 100x better than it but TCP/IP isnt going anywhere due its standard, adoption and big players support.
Regarding altcoins, are there at least one real world use of them except speculation? As far as an answer will be 'yes', BTC is gonna be hard leader. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:18:32
I don't know any good alternatives, sorry. All of them have tradeoffs and the biggest issue is high fees. I. M traveling the world now and basically been forced to take cash (like couple of grand) before I left for not cash out from the card. Once my cash is gone I probably head to localbitcoins and sell some coins there. And in this country  where I. M now btc sells premium. But there is always a way. Good luck!

They could just buy and sell and again buy and sell, creating massive volatility thus discouraging users from trusting their money to Bitcoin. USA alone spending trillions on warfare so if they would like to attack the network - they could do it. Why they don't do it? Maybe bankers don't give enough bribes? Maybe they still contemplating the strategies. But it's absolute possible that government will strike at the moment when nobody expects... And then people loose the money. Imagine 100billion lost :/
