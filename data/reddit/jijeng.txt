Did you not read his post? He said nothing but a large, helpful and friendly community. Meanwhile we have people like you caught up with the idea that Bitcoin should be the only cryptocurrency. Why should competition be stifled?

Yes, there are some people jumping on Dogecoin, Litecoin, etc. etc in hopes of seeing another Bitcoin bubble. However, if you visit the Dogecoin subreddit, they're doing amazing things like charities and easing people into the idea of cryptocurrencies without the hostilities you sometimes see at Bitcoin. Regardless, Bitcoin is no better. A lot of people are holding Bitcoins in expectance of seeing new ATHs/bubbles.

What about for people who have locked it away in a cold storage? More trouble for them and makes Bitcoin less convenient for long-term storage. Bitcoins being infinitely divisible make them resistant to lack of supply. There's no need for "verification" activity rules like these to scare away long-term investors.

I'm assuming it takes time to verify and process the the funds for BTC-e. You COULD theoretically do that but there's no guarantee that the price won't drop by the time you get to Coinjar. Also, transaction fees.

Hi Eric! Took a look at your website and was wondering if you guys do made-to-order Standard Card Holders w/o a logo? Do you guys provide warranty on these items and do they ship to the US? Thank you! They look great.

No prob. It was a debate after all.
