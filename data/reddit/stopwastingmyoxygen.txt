Just signed up with coinbase, put in my bank information, accidentally picked savings account instead of checking because for some reason was on top. I remove that and go to pick my my checking account and tells me I need to wait 24 hours that's just fucking great. 
I bet now it's going to ask me to send picture of my id and shit cause i messed up the first time
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:20:07
Do they have a live chat I can contact so they can shorten this time?
@_date: 2016-03-28 19:29:34
whats wrong with coinbase?
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:05:23
I really don't care about getting spyed on as long as they don't fuck with me
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:38:28
Wow you really think so? I made a mistake buying 150$ at 2200 if thats the case. I want to buy a lot more and your post makes me wait and see what happens
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:29:32
For real, if this truly was a bubble, would it be going up this much and for this long?
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:07:44
no i meant like its very unlikely to happen at this point right?
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:05:59
Yeah but thats not why people are investing. Most people now are putting money in because of the hype just to make a quick profit. I understand that it may crash and bounce back, but i still think it will crash.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:30:20
at this point, does anyone actually truly believe it will fall under 2200?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:55:07
Shhh let them think what they want
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:27:26
i dont know about that, maybe in 2 years
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:24:43
i would if i could m8 but waiting to verify my credit card. plus im poor.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:00:32
It was meant to be more of a discussion. Either way im not selling. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:00:20
If the bubble pops and it starts falling, will we have a chance to sell before its too late. I bought 150 last night, would like to sell and buy again if its gonna be a drastic fall
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:44:20
But thats exactly what people are doing right now
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:10:44
i guess i can just wait for this dip everyone is talking about to buy one month's worth instead of going every week. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:33:07
Will never crash back down to that price
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:17:01
alright i went ahead and bought 50 right now. Saving rest to see how this plays out
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:08:20
Doesnt really answer my question 
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:07:31
anyway to set coinbase to automatically buy if bitcoin drops to like 600?
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:16:56
Yeah but not really. The more people that buy, the more the price goes up. Its not just some guy or company sitting there typing in the price. And it seems like these days more and more people are investing seeing how much its going up. I personally dont see it dropping back down to 500 or 600 but ill put the buy order in anyway.

@_date: 2017-05-07 04:47:11
being sarcastic?
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:20:18
Already verified 
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:34:03
No idea if youre being sarcastic or genuine 
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:59:08
You really think at this point bitcoin will ever drop back down to 500 in the near future? 
If that's the case, I rather wait for it to drop in order to invest. But I dont see it dropping anytime soon back to..500.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:43:33
I use vpn with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:20:00
Around 1500-1700 most likely 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:23:47
About the other questions?
@_date: 2015-03-04 13:34:54
I just used a VPN to change my IP and it worked. Thank you

Well the thing is, last month it was 800-900 and it's rising almost 100 dollars a day currently.
All that im asking if this is a temporary thing or if this bubble will burst. I know I want to buy and hold, everyday technology is advancing, when i grew up, barely anyone had phones or computers. Kids today almost all have access to the internet, i believe in bitcoin to keep rising as we advance. 
You could say im scared, well yes i am. 500 dollars is a lot of money. I just want to find out when to invest this 500
General consensus seems to be that the best time to buy was yesterday. 
I'm willing to be patient, but at the same time..
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:42:19
Logging in is a pain tho
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:03:32
Yeah but i delete cookies and shit
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:09:41
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:10:18
Was it a mistake to buy 150 last night?
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:06:15
I got 250-500 dollars ready to invest. I hear everyone saying this bubble is going to burst. Buying as soon as price drops. IT WAS UNDER 1K LESS THAN A MONTH AGO
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:00:28
the exchange one does
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:46:16
Decades 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:03:23
Since the prices are dropping right now kinda hard to setup a limit order, how bad are the fees for using market. how much would i lose lets say if i wanted to sell .05?
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:05:51
Do you use GDAX? Do you have steam or discord? i have questions id like to ask
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:56:38
I just placed a limit sell order for .05 at 2970. Where do I see it?
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:11:10
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:08:04
Can someone add me on steam or discord for some quick questions?
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:16:04
Should i sell and then buy when it drops?
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:34:00
Jeusus fucking how happy are you right now
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:14:11
I just sold .05 on the market because i saw the fee was .25% and that doesnt seem like much.
Is this a mistake
edit: sorry im new to this
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:17:44
Thats why i use blockchain as a middleman. Common people 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:52:33
So if I sell using limit they wont charge me anything?
but if i use market i will be charged
