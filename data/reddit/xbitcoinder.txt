I use coinbase to temp store BTC. Because I think China exchanges are too easily to be shutdown..

That looks exactly like me(right) and my friends(left) when I talk about bitcoin to them. Still early adoption phase my Bitcoin!

Can anyone explain what software should I run now? I am on BIP148(since before the HF), but should Segwit happen, which software should I run?

After I read the white paper I spot the "block chain" shares similarities of "chained cyphers" that I always played with in University time. 
Now each time I explain to others what is bitcoin I enjoy the phrase "irreversible transaction" and "I control my money(value), not my banker".
Now I have the chance to enjoy the freedom of storing my value that I worked for, freedom of spending it when I see proper, and the freedom of moving it wherever I like to spend rest of my life.
We believed in God, believed in Gov, believed in paper money, now we have a protocol that allows trust to be forged between strangers. It is far from perfect, but it is working.
I think the future of Bitcoin is like this:
Since the core of Bitcoin is "broadcast" then the satellite program is necessary. To enjoy the ultimate freedom, Bitcoin may get banned or network block on the ISP. We need a method to over come this. Satellite is a good solution. 
Who knows? in 50 years we may already set our foot on Mars. We need a trans-planet system of broadcasting and transaction that can be trust in the whole sola system. 
Bitcoin ( and its leading tech ) is the end of central authorities. Good job!

Because BTCC is a Shanghai based exchange, other 2 are Beijing based. Shanghai Finiance officials has got the instructions from above ahead of Beijing. And talked to BTCC immediately. That doesn't mean Okcoin and Huobi won't get it in the next few days. Shanghai - Beijing follow the same rules tightly, that is how politics work in China. ( unlike USA, the states can say f-ck the fedral rules )

Nice! Thank you very much! Review the code later!

Interesting... Monopoly of protocol. So the devs are the powerful guys?

"one person". For companies no limits. My uncle runs a electric fan company and they have tons of export. They have all debt in RMB, all income in USD. Business model mate. Mining is simply "virtually" exporting coal, electricity and gain USD.

No, it is not a FUD, it is simply a news. And the exchange is announcing shutdown. BTCC is closing business on 30th. Almost hit 3000 USD on the temp dip. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:45
hmmmm, interesting. Where comes the number?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:21:37
NONONONO, you only think of it as a single exchange, to be honest, the gap of price is 10% - 16% between exchanges in and out China. That's why someone has the power of moving money just buy buy buy. They won't keep coins over night, just sell it and get the traffic fee of 10%
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:51:53
Well, if so, let's see the reduce of hash power and the doom day of BTC!
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:59:53
I think the 23000 YUAN is the bottom of any news that comes in the future. Hopefully. No further harm can be done to Bitcoin any longer!

I simply convey the news and do a translation. Ask PBoC if it is true or not. But everyday 16:00 China time is scary. But I really don't think it is a FUD: when the boots finally on the ground, the price shall back to normal.

USD-&gt;RMB is welcoming in China. But RMB-&gt;USD is not. That's called capital control mate....

No need to thank, all hands to the deck! I am now running the UASF for over a week now. 
Now let up keep it up till and beyond 1st Aug.
my UASF post:

Well, at least you could speak peacefully and nicely rather than the f word on Reddit, maybe?
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:14:27
I think the only way to guard the happening of SegWit (regardless of who propose it) would be running the real full node and keep running it passing the Aug 1st. To safe guard our decentralized principle.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:09:32
I actually laughed.

These are your servers? or your connected peers? Seems Windows?
