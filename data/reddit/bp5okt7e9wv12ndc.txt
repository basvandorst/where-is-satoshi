Too much money to trade hands. My bank would freeze my accounts trying to deposit that much money.

I'd be afraid that would raise a flag and cause an audit. But if you don't have any proof of cost basis, that's the best you can do. Did you consult a tax professional yet?

I understand, but it's different. There are law enforcement agencies following bitcoin addresses and arresting people who convert to fiat. Although similar, there is quite a difference than using a dollar that was used to purchase drugs.

Bitcoin, as used by most people, is traceable - it's been proven time and again. Using mixers makes it much more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:16:34
I agree. but I would think any use of mixers before the bill becomes law will be grandfathered in as legal.

But if you are a US citizen you are still required to file the trade with the IRS.

What's the kool-aid in his comment?

Well if you bought bitcoin back when it was cheap and you own 100k worth worth of coins and want to cash out the only feasible way is to transfer to a bank account and pay taxes. Not easy to do without your bank asking questions, IRS asking questions.

No problem if you hold the coins forever. But if the coins are ever going to serve any practical or useful purpose in your life then you'll have to convert to fiat, convert to another crytocurrency, or make a purchase. All of those require filing a gains report (if you have a gain) with the IRS.

You're right about a mixer not being a crime, but talking to some people and reading comments from lawmakers makes it seem like a money laundering activity. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:09:21
But then how do you convert back to fiat in the U.S. without the IRS and US government accusing you of fraudulent activity? Privacy is nice, but some of us who acquired coins back when they were less than 100/per have to be careful because we don't have a paper trail showing how we got the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:59:13
In the US you pay taxes on any gains from any conversions, purchases, or sales. Read that carefully - conversions, purchases, or sales.

Agree with everything you wrote.

I don't have any records from localbitcoins, or the lost coins. I lost access to the account and that computer 4+ years ago. I only have my records from coinbase and the coins sitting on my paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:13:07
That's an excellent point. Thanks for the rational thinking.
Edited to add: I guess my concern or paranoia comes with anticipating the possibility of having to explain what I believe is 100% legal activity but that is viewed skeptically by the government as illegal activity. Listen to lawmakers and they act like only drug dealers and terrorists use mixers. I've read stories of federal law enforcement beating down doors of people who ended up with tainted coins and tried to cash out and that's what I'm trying to avoid.

Don't forget purchases. Buy a coffee with bitcoin? That's a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:56:26
I'm in a similar position. So what are you going to do?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:19:41
People are making huge profits and taking risk with prison time. Makes no sense. Pay the taxes and enjoy the once in a lifetime profits. The IRS does not mess around. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:58:37
You call this a crash, son? You must be new to bitcoin. I recommend you turn off the news, ignore the bullshit, and go enjoy your life. See you back here in a couple years and we'll either be celebrating or still working our meaningless jobs. That's the risk we take with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:18:40
Why is that funny? I'm basically asking is there a way for governments or police agencies to access those wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:22:19
That's what people don't realize. The U.S. could easily squeeze people out of bitcoin by making it inconvenient and difficult to use. They don't even have to make it illegal. They already make it hard by taxing use. Want to buy something with bitcoin? You have to file it on your income taxes. They can make it difficult, inconvenient to the point that "regular" people won't want to bother with it. Sure, the enthusiasts will find a way to pursue the hobby but bitcoin won't flourish if the U.S. moves against it. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:25:11
Thanks! That's what I thought and wanted to confirm. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:26:25
I understand bitcoin. My question was about the Bread app, not bitcoin nor the underlying technology. I wanted to know if there was a way for the developer or anyone else to get into the data (backdoor) in the app.
