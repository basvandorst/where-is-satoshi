I wouldn't say it sacrifices security, more that it's more open, which allows developers to make mistakes. You can do more with it, but that, of course, leaves attack surface.
Now to be clear: I don't see any reason that Ethereum's blockchain itself is any more or less secure than Bitcoins - I'm talking purely about smart contracts.
Neither ETH or BTC is more secure than the other when used purely as a PoW P2P currency. But where BTC's attack surface is basically limited to your wallet having a bug, your PC having a virus, or the exchange being hacked: ETH has those problems plus the risk of a mistake when programming a smart contract.
But smart contracts are also why ETH is unique and powerful, and properly developed, tested, and audited smart contracts are just as trustworthy as an open source wallet, for example: and significantly better than an exchange.

Considering that Bitcoin has twice "crashed" to 20% a couple of times, I'm happy that even if we saw another such "crash", my crypto net worth would still be &gt;90% of what I put in.
The longer you're here, the less a crash matters. Those worried about a crash are therefore almost certainly new to be worried about anything less than a 50% drop in price: hell, if you bought in before October 16th, you can handle a 60-65% crash before you're even out of pocket: that's just over 6 weeks ago.

I've never  understood the "But it's not backed by anything" thing
Currency exists as a medium of exchange. It exists to allow me to trade my goats for your bananas, when you don't want goats, you want pigs. It allows us to make that trade without having to first find someone who wants to trade pigs for goats: we can use money instead, and I can sell my goats to anyone, then give you the money which you use to buy pigs.
Money exists to represent value in a fungible, consistent, easy to use and understand way. It exists so we can trade  with each other without having to find a middleman who wants/has the goods we do.
I don't give two shits that my Bitcoin isn't "backed by the government" - I don't see the government giving me back my money if I lose it: all I see is them printing more, so my "backed" money is worth less.
My money exists so I can sell you things, buy things from you, and do the same with everyone else. That's it. Bitcoin does that
I don't know when, exactly, money became a "thing" in it's own right. Money isn't valuable, money just allows us to trade valuable things without carrying goats around, without stupidly complex "chains" of trades, and allows us to compare commodities directly.
I don't need the government to back my money: I just need other people to accept it.

Sure, but the point is that stores will have an incentive to accept Bitcoin because they can either
- Provide cheaper prices to Bitcoin users
- Or (more likely) simply make a larger profit
The former would be better for Bitcoin users in that users would get better prices, the latter would encourage store adoption. Overall, I'd rather see the latter for Bitcoin overall, and I think it's far more likely to materialize.
If you owned a store, would you rather make 3% more money?

This is a different comment to your one above.
Majority miner support definitely isn't enough, in the day of ASICs, to define Bitcoin.
Miners, in conjunction with nodes and (most important of all) economic activity? Yes, that's much closer to the mark
Either way, the name shouldn't belong to the Exchanges any more than it belongs to the Miners.

I’d say it means that the day to day running of the currency is decentralised: eg the nodes and possibly miners, such that it is possible to monitor the system from outside the government, with or without transactions being run by the users 
But the emission can be controlled by a single party, and therefore be centralised.
Whether the running of the currency could therefore ever be truly decentralised is an interesting question. And to be clear, I don’t think this currency is in any way equivalent to Bitcoin - I’m just saying that I don’t think that government involvement and backing automatically prevents a currency from sharing any traits with bitcoin or being considered a cryptocurrency on at least some of the defining aspects.

I wouldn't even call it a "correction" - a correction is where things have moved a little quickly or slowly for a few weeks and then adjust back to where they should be. A brief dip isn't even a correction.
A correction would be, for example, the jump in early August when the price had been depressed a little by wariness over the BCH/BTC fork, and then corrected upward once the market realized nothing bad happened. Similarly a correction now would be a drop of perhaps 5-20% due to the crazy growth we've seen lately (above recent trends) followed by a continued steady upward growth rather than a recovery. A recovery suggests it was either a mini panic, or a localized (£9k or €10k) selloff, IMO

To be fair, "cryptocurrency" doesn't necessarily mean "decentralized" or "non-government backed"
Bitcoin is those things, sure - but a cryptocurrency is one where balances and transaction integrity are enforced by cryptography. It doesn't even necessarily need to be on a blockchain.
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with a government-backed cryptocurrency as a technical concept, although I think we'll all feel like our "thing" is being hijacked a bit.

What part of “decentralised” is so hard for you to understand? If I wanted some random authority to decide everything for me, I’d just let my government run everything and use fiat: at least I can vote for them

Well yeah, exponential growth simply can't happen forever - I entirely agree.
I thought you were talking more real term. But to be fair, I agree that the 12-13x growth we saw last year is unlikely to happen again - and certainly nothing resembling it for more than another few years.
But 1500% is 15x, not 150x: which would be 180k in 1 year, and 2.7 million in 2 years: not 1.7 and 253 million as you stated.
We can maintain something *resembling* this growth for a year or two, although realistically I think most of us are expecting it to tail off over the next 3-12 months into something a little more steady: if still impressive

No: but as someone mentioned on a video recently added to this sub - there are 15 million millionaires in the US.
Let's assume that each of them decides to put 1% of their wealth in Bitcoin. And that each of them is "only just" a millionaire (eg they have exactly 1 million dollars). That would mean each wants $10k worth of BTC. For the sake of argument, let's say that's the current price of BTC (since it's been the price in the last week)
So each of them tries to buy $10k worth of BTC, or 1 BTC each... but there are probably not enough in the world (once we remove those known to be lost) for them to have one each. And many of those who currently own them, aren't going to sell them for $10k each.
That means demand outstrips supply, which pushes up the price.
And that
- Assumes nobody has more than $1m
- Assumes nobody with less than $1m wants to invest in BTC
- Assumes nobody is buying for *any* other reason
- Is based on only 1% of their net worth
- Is just the millionaires in the US
Now to be clear, I don't think that every single millionaire in the world is going to suddenly decide to put 1% of their net worth in Bitcoin. But if even 10% of US Millionaires over the next 5 years decide to take a punt, that's going to increase the price significantly. And that ignores the rest of the world, ignores non millionaires, and ignores every other potential use or user of Bitcoin.
There are no guarantees here, but there a lot of reasons Bitcoin could and should be worth a lot more than $10-12k each

I will be holding 30% minimum until 2020+
However, if the price rockets:
10% will be removed if we hit $20k, and will mean that no matter what happens, I’ve made a very good profit off my Crypto investment. Then I’ll take out up to 30% when it can pay off my mortgage or most of it, and another 30% when it can pay the difference between my house and my ideal family Home.
HODL is a great meme, but I have goals and will certainly be cashing out some of my holdings to achieve them.
That remaining 30% can stay until either we hit the moon or I’m given 6 months to live and spend it on hookers and blow. It probably won’t make me rich, but it might be enough for a few years off my retirement if I’ve already paid off my house 
If we don’t hit the moon, or even increase in value much, I’m on a profit regardless. If we crash to zero, I’ll be a bit gutted but I’ll still own a house with a manageable mortgage, and I’ll still have a car and a reasonable pension scheme etc

Exactly, because they keep printing money, devaluing money. This is an issue because their currency is fiat.
They are talking about launching a currency which is **backed by commodities**. This is far closer to being equivalent USD on the Gold Standard than it is to the current Venezuelan Bolivar, for example, because it's basically trading gold/diamonds/petrol (crude oil?).
The Gold Standard was actually quite a good form of centralized money. This should dramatically reduce Venezuelan inflation

I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert, but my understanding is that when you receive/accept a payment, you authorize other payments (and check the payments they authorized). These payments are chosen deterministically, so you can't just choose your friends' or your own transactions to authorize, nor they yours. Your incentive is that when you try to spend the funds you received, your own payment is checked by another node. If you authorize an invalid payment or a chain with invalid payments in it, your own received funds are forfeit and/or your transaction will not be accepted. This is roughly akin to the way BTC miners are disincentivized to work on an invalid block, because their own block will be orphaned and they will not receive the block reward.
The work done to authorize the other transactions is, essentially, the transaction fee for receiving/sending your own transaction: you "pay it forward" (or backward?) by validating the previous transactions in exchange for the next person validating yours
That's likely heavily simplified or even factually incorrect on the specifics, but I believe it to be the gist of the idea.

Which is fine when the mempool is consistently clearing and that you can trust the transaction will eventually hit the blockchain. Eg it’s good for confirming a transaction that will hit the block in 10-20 minutes.
It’s not so good when the mempool is full and low fee transactions are not even guaranteed to get into a block.

The problem here is that you're assuming you, I, and anyone else here, will always agree with whoever controls the Bitcoin GitHub.
Before you hit downvote, I'm really not being negative towards the Core Devs here: but it's shortsighted and naive to assume that, even if you 100% agree with and support them in every decision they've ever made (and I doubt anyone here can honestly say that), there is absolutely no guarantee you will agree with them in future. Or that the team won't leave and be replaced by others. Or, in an extreme example, arrested, taken to a secure facility and forced to give up their user accounts, putting Bitcoin under the control of an unfriendly government regime.
The idea that we will all always, no matter what, agree with Core and the "status quo" (ie no fork) is, frankly, a dangerous one. To be clear, I think the days of "Bitcoin is whatever has most hashpower" is behind us, and is out-dated in the era of the ASIC... but realistically what is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is whatever Bitcoin-genesis-block coin is used, chosen, supported, and run, by the community and our nodes, miners, and most importantly our economic activity. Nothing more, nothing less.
The day we start saying that the current fork is inviolable, that the current devs are infallible, and that we want exchanges to police the naming convention... is the day we may as well all give up and go back to fiat... because that's exactly how governments work.
If we want to take the power to decide which coin is Bitcoin and put it in the hands of a few exchanges, we fucked up even harder than if we put that same power in the hands of a few large scale miners.

Sure it’s possible I’ll lose it - but it’s no different to carrying cash and much less hassle than worrying about having my Ledger with me (and then the hassle of replacing that if I lose it), or having to keep more seeds safe.
I’d certainly not recommend keeping larger sums on an exchange

1. Incorrect.
There is no way to get the key from the device, but you can get it from the seed. Pedantic perhaps, but I think this nuance is important to make users aware of: the security of the seed (eg where you store it) is of paramount importance

There are tons of schemes you can come up with too:
Take a set of playing cards. Put the playing cards in order like a new set.
Take a number that only means something to you, eg your childhood phone number, then start selecting cards according to that number
Eg 555-1234 would be the 5th, 10th, and 15th cards, then 16th, 18th, 21st, And 25th. Then just repeat, starting again at the beginning if you reach the end of the pack.
As you get to each card, write the next seed word. Then when you’re done, just fill in the rest of the pack with random words chosen from the word list (generating a new wallet is a good way to randomise the words)
Make up your own schemes, use different objects etc.

I'd argue it's more that the terms aren't really all that well established.

I don't think there are any all-encompassing definitions for cryptocurrency, and I'm not convinced all uses of "decentralized" as used in crypto are even consistent with each other.
Realistically I think we have to accept that "cryptocurrency" will inevitably be co-opted as a term by governments and banks, at least to some extent

Not parent, but no - that's fine. It's often called DCA (Dollar Cost Average), and it's a good way to buy long term while reducing your risk.
The higher the price is by the time I finish by long term monthly buy, the more the first amount will be worth. That's a good thing, it means you've made money
As long as the price isn't significantly lower (10% or more) after 5 years, you've still done as well as putting the money in your bank account. And if the price gets to the point where your last $500 is buying significantly less than your first $500, such that you're noticing the price difference... you're probably quite wealthy

The government will hold a fixed amount of those resources for each "Petro" they mint.
It's basically like the Gold Standard, but using Gold, Petrol, and Diamonds. Eg for every Petro you have in your hand, you can swap it for a fixed amount of Gold, Petrol, and/or Diamonds (see last paragraph), much like under the Gold Standard you could trade your USD for a fixed amount of gold.
I'm assuming he actually means crude oil rather than "petrol" (petroleum gas), but perhaps not.
The interesting thing is that the currency is backed by more than one commodity at the same time: does anyone know whether they will be backed in a fixed ratio, or whether the ratios of each commodity can vary?
I believe it to be a fairly sensible move for a government struggling with hyperinflation: a currency backed by global-market commodities is unlikely to see much price fluctuation.

PM me your case reference?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:42:33


I mean, let's go straight to the one part of the whitepaper that mentions decision making: Section 4


That seems pretty conclusive. Where there is a decision to be made, the majority decision is represented by the longest chain.
If BCH, SW2X, or any other fork in future, has the greatest proof of work invested in it, then BCH **IS** bitcoin, and the decision for the scaling debate **has** been made. Whether I like it or not, whether you like it or not.
In fact, this section (detail quoted below) **specifically** goes against "nodes make the rules", and acknowledges that someone like Amazon or Google could easily spin up thousands of nodes in seconds. There are 9000 Bitcoin nodes. Amazon owns 1.5 MILLION servers, and each of those could host dozens of virtual machines to act as nodes.


Tell me how that's wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:14:48
But the consensus would have been different... I'm talking about if the nodes had been up for 18 months or something 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:48:57
You're surprised that the brand new BCH chain has had fewer transactions than BTC? Of course you are, that's not dodging the point at all ;-)
Either way, the point stands that it would take literally years of 8MB blocks before my $5 VPS can't handle a node, and that's assuming I can't upgrade to a more powerful VPS for similar money.
This whole "OMFG huge blockchains mean you can't run a node" is just a complete nonsense. I run BCH and BTC nodes, and I pay a total of $10/mo
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:32:24
Yeah. I've read a lot of FUD about a lot of stuff, but this is the biggest nonsense
SegWit I'm sceptical is the ultimate answer, but I can completely see how it's seen as one alternative: it makes sense, and doesn't have to be perfect to make sense.
8MB blocks I'm sceptical is the final answer, but again I can see the current use.
Between the two, I can understand why the community is split.
Lightning network I can see the logic of
But 1MB being some kind of religious imperative is just nonsense. It feels like people are hating it right now just because BCH prefer bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:22:36
Yeah, ETH has promise but is already at something like 50% of BTC value because although it's 1/10th the price there's 5x as much in circulation with higher inflation/production, so it's not like buying BTC at $200 - more like $1000 assuming their values follow similar trajectories. Certainly worth looking at, but not an order of magnitude put on BTC
As for the rest of the altcoins - I agree with you, it's a lottery. Either you take a punt on a few and risk missing out, or you invest in them all and make a high % on a small investment on some, which is partially cancelled out anyway by the others.
IMO it's a case of BTC and ETH for steady but respectable gains, then pick a couple of the more likely candidates for speculation and hope for the best, and throw a bit at a random couple of shitcoins as a lottery ticket.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:53:53
It's about scaling for the future, not about what is needed right now: although BCH has had 4MB and 8MB blocks actually produced.
It takes months to implement any scaling solution: If we wait until we actually need TX capacity to implement it, it's too late and we're going to stifle growth and lose momentum right when BTC is gaining traction.
Solve the problem early, reap the benefits later
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:10:57
It's not LN compatible yet. Right now (until SW), neither is BTC... there are plenty of ways BCH could solve transaction malleability (BIP140 for one) without SW.

Low difficulty doesn't reduce security, that's utter nonsense.
And billions were created: that's the problem of using "market cap" as a measure, it's completely irrelevant to crypto for anything other than measuring crypto against each other - and even then it's a shit measurement and should be replaced by a price velocity type measurement (price x daily volume, preferably averaged over a few days)

That's not what cumulative proof of work means. You aren't taking difficulty into account.

I disagree, I think this quote actually proves nothing of the sort.
1. ViaBTC state they will have a new service that allows you to auto-mine the most profitable chain
2. Someone asks if you can choose which to mine
3. Bitmain answer that you can
Bitmain's answer appears, surely, to be wrong? ViaBTC's project here clearly states that it will **automatically switch**, and that the user therefore **will not** be choosing which coin to mine. Bitmain's answer states that the user **will** be choosing which coin to mine. That answer is clearly wrong.
If Bitmain and ViaBTC were the same person switching accounts, surely they wouldn't contradict themselves and provide an incorrect answer? I know social media users can sometimes be confused, but this is such a fundamental part of ViaBTC's offering in the tweet that I'd be stunned if they misunderstood their own tweet so badly to answer as the Bitmain account did
This looks far more like Bitmain trying to help out but misunderstanding the question: and if anything, shows that the two accounts are **not** the same

First up, while that could work in the very short term while there are only a couple of pools mining BCH, in the long run (when difficulty is at ~15 minute blocks), 87.5% of miners to force that difficulty dump. That's not going to happen beyond this initial mining phase.
Once BCH mining is profitable, other miners won't ignore that: that's a huge opportunity for profit for them if they move their own miners accross to mining BCH.
Also, when the difficulty drops by 20%, again, miners will move accross from BTC mining: even if you support BTC and dislike the BCH fork, you aren't going to turn down a bunch of extra, surely? I'm fairly confident there are enough people in the world who are neutral enough on this issue to do so.
You'd be missing out on 12 hours worth of profits, only to give yourself more competition and less profits afterwards. Any rational miner would be better off keeping the difficulty at the correct level for the price, and retaining a higher proportion of the network hashrate, giving you higher consistent profits.
I mean, if I saw a 200 PH/s network doing this, I'd spin up some cloud mining and scoop up the profits myself.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:25:12
Bullshit. Running a node costs ~$60/year for a basic VPS with decent bandwidth, and can be bootstrapped in under 12 hours. The size of the blockchain isn't even slightly concerning as a barrier to entry.
Other than a few people in the third world on $1 a day wages, anybody who doesn't currently run a node, simply doesn't want to.
If we found some clever way to compress the blockchain to 10% of the current size, I doubt we'd even see a measurable increase in node creation

And you don't consider this dangerous to a decentralized currency?


Again, you don't consider this dangerous in a decentralized currency?
In both of these scenarios, you're talking about the entire currency being driven by a small group of people.
Although to extend the question, then - what happens if the developers are split 50-50 too?
Surely the correct answer is that whichever chain collects the most nodes, miners, and users, is Bitcoin? Why are we relying on a handful of people to decide the rules for the planet? It's not even like we elected them (although moving away from elected officials is part of the reason we're here)
I'm trying to steer away from concern questions and comments here, because concern trolling is a thing - but I do think there's a genuine question over centralization here: You're talking about a handful of people making the decisions, and I can't see how that's right. Bitcoin shouldn't be a trademark linked to the .org site, it should be decided by the blockchain itself: the one with the users, miners, proof of work, nodes, market value etc etc

Node count means basically nothing - I could spin up 10 nodes right now with low data caps, for less than $10/month total.
With 9000 nodes then even using $5 VPS for every node, I could double the BTC node count for less than $50k a month and have 50% of the node "voting" power. 
That's 1 block reward, to run the entire BTC node network for a month. People were spinning up 500 nodes at a time on AWS during BCH's first couple of days. Node counts mean almost literally nothing.

Yeah, I'm in agreement that some kind of off-chain scaling is probably inevitable: although I don't think "We have off chain scaling" is a good excuse for high fees.
IMO users are being forced to L2 by arbitrary fees, though - that's not the right way to do things.
If L2 is to compete, it should do so because it is a good solution, not because it's the only option.
I've got no issue with L2 solutions, but they need to compete on their own merits, not just on "Well, it's cheaper than $5 fees", especially when those $5 fees are the result of an arbitrarily chosen number

@_date: 2017-08-21 23:34:31
Internet bandwidth certainly did for many. In 2009 I had 1Mbps internet, now I have 100Mbps and could get 300Mbps. That's two orders of magnitude, and that's fairly common in the west. And although the developing world is slower, there's no requirement to host a node now like in 2009. Also, where internet is coming to the developing world, its skipping straight to higher speeds than the 56k modem I still had in 2003
And if your node is using 1TB then you're not setting limits and almost certainly using a fairly high connection count. You can run a node with limited bandwidth and usage limits. Mine is running at 10Mbps with a 500GB data cap. This is an option for anyone, even at lower speeds.
And as mentioned, not everyone needs to run a node. Those who wish to do so can donate as much or as little bandwidth as they like and can afford.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:46:59
That will indeed be slow, but surely anyone with any intent to trade today/tomorrow immediately after the fork, has done so knowing full well that this would be an issue and has pre-moved their coins where they need them?

Both start from the same genesis block, and BCH is, technically speaking, clearly closer to the original white paper than SegWit is.
That said, the chain with the "real Bitcoin" claim is the one with the greatest cumulative proof of work, that much is clear to anyone and that's clearly BTC unless things change dramatically 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:16:55
That seems like a problem with SegWit, then, not a problem with larger blocks.
You're saying that's justification to avoid 2MB or larger blocks, I'm saying it's justification to fix the original problem for all transactions. If BCH can do it without segwit at all, surely BTC can do it even more easily?
That's a very weak justification for avoiding a block size increase
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:20:20


I think you're over-thinking it. BTC has rocketed this year: on January 1st it was worth less than a cellphone, and most people could buy it with a bit of their savings. Now, for most who aren't middle class professional types, buying one outright is probably out of reach
Also, at the current rate of growth, even buying $100/month won't end up with owning a full BTC
I think for many people, the idea of owning a "full" BTC has some attraction. I'm not sure what the psychology behind it is, but I definitely felt the same before I had my own first BTC: and right now, my original target of joining the 21 club is feeling out of reach for the same reason
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:40:38
You're working on a couple of dubious assumptions though
1. That BTC1 supporters would bother running nodes before the fork (why pay for it when you don't need it yet?)
2. That users and node hosts are the same groups/people
Now I'm not saying either of the above are necessarily true, nor do I have any evidence either way: I'm just pointing out that they are assumptions with, as mentioned, little evidence to support or refute them.
At the end of the day, assuming the fork does happen, the markets and miners will assign the value. After the "BCH will crash and burn lol" mania in this sub prior to August 1st, though, I'm wary of anyone announcing time of death of something that doesn't exist yet.
Either way, if we return to the original point of the discussion for a moment:
I agree that it should be the responsibility of the splitting entity to protect user balances. However, I also believe it is incredibly irresponsible for the splittee(?) not to take prudent steps to ensure user protection.
"But they're the ones splitting off, so we shouldn't have to do anything" is a terrible argument (and I apologize if my paraphrasing here is putting words in your mouth, but I believe that to be the essence of your above post). If someone is about to crash into my car, I don't say "Well, *they* are the ones having an accident" and carry on driving in a straight line without braking: it might be the other person's fault, but my passengers are still my responsibility and I should take any steps possible to protect them, even if the situation is not of my doing.

There's a lot of nonsense going around about SegWit2X. When talking about SW, we need to talk about "Equivalent to", in terms of non-SW blocks.
- SegWit: 1MB blocks, with segregated signatures which means each 1MB block holds the equivalent number of transactions as a non-SW ~2-3MB (4MB in ideal circumstances, but unlikely to be seen in the real world)
- SegWit2X: 2MB blocks, with segregated signatures as above meaning the 2MB block holds the equivalent number of transactions a non-SW 4-6MB block (8MB in ideal circumstances, but unlikely to be seen in the real world)
The signatures are available to full nodes, so they would store 2-3MB/4-6MB for SW and SW2X respectively, but the actual block sizes are 1MB (SW) and 2MB (SW2X). Lightweight nodes would "see" 1MB blocks for SW, and 2MB blocks for SW2X.
In the real world, SW2X is equivalent to a 4-6MB block, with a theoretical maximum of 8MB that you are very unlikely to ever see under real world conditions. It is absolutely not an 8MB block. Realistically, I'd consider SW to be equivalent to a 2 or 3MB block, and SW2X being equivalent to an 4 or 6MB block
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:13:38
This can happen, but without miner, user, exchange etc support they'll all rapidly die out
The idea that each will dilute the value to 1% of the original is nonsense - BCH survived because it had significant minority support. Both SW and SW2X may survive. Both may die off. More likely one survives and the other limps along for a while
The point being that while the ecosystem can fracture to some extent, only a very limited number of coins will actually survive

@_date: 2017-08-23 14:06:07
Exactly. So right now it's "useable" for most people.
But BTC is valuable as a speculative asset because of the value of it's intended use. The intended use is as a currency.


If fees are $2-5, BTC will not reach that potential because it will not be used as a currency. That absolutely makes a difference from an investor's standpoint, because without being useful as a currency, BTC is nothing more than thousands of small SHA256 heaters in China.
For a typical speculator now, $2 fees isn't a problem in terms of "OMFG, this costs me so much!" - it's a problem in terms of "Well, clearly this isn't going to work as a currency"
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:32:14


This is a really bad way to look at it. Sure, you spent something back then which was worth $5 and is worth $32 now... but equally you could have bought $10 worth of BTC.
Money has the value attributed to it at the time. I don't regret saving GBP last year despite the fact GBP has dropped against EUR and USD.
If we don't USE our crypto, then that $5-&gt;$32 growth isn't going to continue.
Spend it and replace it.
My personal policy is "Spend $5 buy $6, spend $10 buy $12". Whenever I use BTC to buy something, I buy 20% more than I spent, increasing my overall crypto holding while supporting the crypto

@_date: 2017-08-22 16:30:26
Can you actually hold a conversation without insults?
People are choosing to use it, fine. That's demand. There is a 1MB block limit, that's supply.
We can either reduce demand with high fees, or increase supply by increasing the block limit or otherwise scaling BTC.
Since other scaling options are not yet ready or tested in real-world use cases, it appears that the obvious solution is to increase the block size **moderately** (I'm talking 2MB, not 32MB here), to give reasonable time for proper evaluation of LN etc.
There's nothing stopping the block size being reduced back to 1MB in future once off-chain scaling proves it is reliable, secure, and useful

Sure, according to the nodes on that fork.
So how do you decide which fork's nodes are "right"? Well that's easy, it's the one with the greatest cumulative proof of work.
Most cumulative (difficulty adjusted) proof of work = longest chain. Longest chain = Bitcoin
Whichever chain has the most proof of work is Bitcoin, and the nodes on that chain decide the rules of Bitcoin
Nodes setup the rules, and where they differ hashrate decides which rules are "Bitcoin".
So "that linger chain doesn't count because it doesn't follow the rules on my node" is literally nonsense - if your node is on a chain with less proof of work, your node is wrong, not theirs.
If you don't understand that, go read the white paper - this concept is probably the single biggest foundation stone of Bitcoin. Most proof of work = law

I think the fact that Blockstream has never stated their business plan is a clear cause for concern. We know exactly what the miners want, we know exactly what users want... but Blockstream are a closed book
Are we meant to assume that they're working on BTC out of the kindness of their hearts? Are they holding 10,000 BTC and stand to make a large fortune by improving it: what are their motives? There's a lot of money been poured into the company and none of us really know what they're trying to achieve
I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I would like a better idea of Blockstream's intentions

I understand why Core would rather avoid a hard fork, but if one is necessary to ensure security, then sometimes you have to accept that the ideal option is no longer possible.

Which would you prefer, a hard fork, or an unprotected blockchain where your transactions can be double spent?

They'd have to sustain their attack for a long time then, which will cost them as much as anyone else mining BCH...
BCH is already under the 6 blocks per 12 hours "trapdoor", so all anyone is doing who mines on BCH now is slowing down how fast others make a profit, by making a loss themselves.
The BCH network already now has as much capacity as BTC, so they won't damage BCH pricing other than a small impact from slower confirmations

Yes. That's the point of a decentralised currency... let the community, users, and market decide who lives
Although the idea that SegWit alone is a sustainable solution to the scaling debate is laughable: the equivalent of 3mb blocks will last for a while, but not long enough that we can stop thinking about it: 2x is needed unless someone has a bright idea of how to compact the transaction data
As for off chain transactions - well, that rather defeats the point of the blockchain, I don't get it, unless I'm missing something there's no guarantee every transaction ends up on the blockchain, so what's the point?
Also, I don't understand the objection to 2x anyway: the main objection to 8MB appears to be data use etc, but 2x plus SegWit gets 75% of the capacity with 1/4 of the data use, why is that a bad thing?

My main concern would be that while it becomes much easier to run a lightweight node, the costs to run a full node are just as high.
That means we're likely to see full nodes fall as a proportion of all nodes, making an attack from that direction easier.
My other concern is that SegWit is, technically speaking, pretty huge - that's a lot of places a bug could sneak in. This is, obviously, only a problem if there are bugs which cause problems or enable an attack: but I've spent long enough developing software that I prefer to assume there is a bug until proven otherwise.
Neither are showstoppers, but are certainly concerns for me

Of course people make that many transactions a week. We're adults with bills and daily expenses.
My bank statement shows well over 200 transactions this month, including bills and debit cards, and that doesn't include cash (another 5 a week just for lunch at work)
I make a minimum of two transactions a week just buying Crypto, never mind anything else.
Admittedly some channels could be reused (5 lunches at work) - but equally my power company is not going to wait a year to collect their 12 transactions from my electricity bill.

You just entirely moved the goalposts back to the original scaling debate: we were discussing the lack of replay protection, and the time taken to implement it securely.
Whether the fork should generally be undertaken is entirely out of scope of the discussion we were having: you used replay protection as a justification not to fork, and now you're returning to "forking is bad" as some kind of justification for not doing the replay protection? Do you not see how that's a paradox
There are many arguments against the fork (as well as many for it).... but replay protection is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:26:27
In my opinion, neither can justify *currently* claiming the Bitcoin name. To me, that defaults to the chain which can consistently and legitimately claim to have the greatest cumulative proof of work, value, daily volume, market penetration, or some significant combination thereof such that that coin is clearly more valuable than the others.
Right now, out of BCH/BTC(-SW)/SW2X, that's clearly BTC-SW. If BCH clearly surpasses BTC-SW, though, then to me that is a clear indication that the community and markets have decided upon larger blocks for Bitcoin. At that point, I would consider BCH to be Bitcoin. Equally if the same happened with SegWit2X.
Or, naturally, if BTC retains market position then I would continue to consider BTC/BTC-SW to be Bitcoin, as I do right now.
My question here is more to others: do you agree with the above concept, or would you consider BCH to be an altcoin even if BCH overtook BTC-SW next year and spent the next decade clearly out-performing it? Where is the line? At what point does perspective change and SegWit becomes the alt coin, if unsuccessful?
I'm no BCH shill here - I legitimately don't have a horse in this race, or if I do it's BTC: I've kept my BTC and BCH holdings from August 1st, and bought more BTC since. In terms of dollar value, I'm much more heavily invested in BTC (Something like 8:1). I'm just genuinely interested in the perspective of both groups on how consensus and management of decision making should be handled.

There would be absolutely no benefit to doing that inside a live block on BCH right now. The 8MB block was pretty clearly the result of someone trying to spam the mempool.

300 PH/s is around 5% of the BTC global hashrate. That would be 3.6 blocks per 12 hours, or around 45 BTC. Obviously we can't know if they would have mined 3 or 4 (or potentially outside this due to luck and variance) but it would average out as 3.6 blocks

No, but it helps avoid bad publicity at an important time.
My personal opinion is that 2MB now would alleviate enough of the pressure to allow other solutions to be better explored and implemented, while having a clear reasoning behind it and not, therefore, risking a slippery slope to 100GB blocks.
I can see the justification behind not wanting to exponentially grow the block size for years, but I just can't understand why 1MB blocks = good, 2MB blocks = bad. We're talking about a small arbitrary increase: Satoshi could easily have chosen 2MB blocks when he added the limit to reduce the risk of spam

Okay, so they end up with their own version (eg a version of BTC without SegWit) - and as we've seen with BCH, they become an altcoin apparently.
That's literally my question: How much of the community has to split off from the developers before they can claim the "name" of Bitcoin?
I'm literally asking this: If BCH ends up with a higher price, daily trade volume, market cap, node count, miner count, and a longer PoW chain than BTC, is BCH now Bitcoin according to this definition?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:49:47
They didn't, in this specific context: the auto-switcher is automatic.
Now if they interpreted the question as "do we have to mine on the auto-switcher, or can we choose any coin" then the answer is pretty fucking obvious, surely? It's fairly clear to anyone who's reasonably fluent in English that this is offered by ViaBTC as an additional feature, not a replacement to mining individual coins
As to why they would answer, I've covered that in another comment: growing a highly profitable market.
There's also the possibility, unsurprisingly, that Bitmain had opened ViaBTC's tweet in a "researching the competition" capacity, and then mixed it up with their own tweets and accidentally replied.

I trust Bitcoin, because I trust the underlying technology.
My problem is that, without a full history, how do I trust Bitcoin in future? What's my guarantee that Lightning Network (or any other implementation) is fully trustworthy?
Now, I do agree with the concept of aggregating transactions between two parties, for example, and only putting the "final result" on the blockchain. That seems sensible.

Mining in a pool with inefficient hardware is just throwing money away - you'd be far better off just spending that power bill money on buying BTC - the power costs are low, but the rewards are even lower, it's pointless. These older ASICs only make sense with free power, and/or as a lottery
Personally I run a little U2 solo mining. I'll probably never get anything back, but if I do it'll be a good chunk of money.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:14:15
Again, you are assuming they are mining at a **loss** not just a a **smaller profit** or breaking even. As long as they are breaking even, they don't need to worry about paying the electricity bill, right?
They do not have to predict the markets if they are breaking even. Let's assume that they are mining at break even with regard to their power costs, even if they have extended their expected ROI timeframe on their hardware.
The question is how they calculate their greatest profit. They do not need to worry about the electricity bill, because they can sell enough mining reward to pay that.
And their profit incentive is discussed above. If they have large investments in BCH, they may decide that keeping the chain alive is worth more than the instant reward for mining BTC
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:35:45
I mean, that's literally the idea - that miners act rationally and mine the most profitable chain, therefore following the market

Ethereum has ~15 second blocks and this isn't a problem there. There would obviously be a point where it becomes unworkable, but considering BTC is **already** mostly mined by massive pools, it's not gonna matter too much anyway. And we're still talking about a MASSIVE difficulty adjustment to hit that point.
Bitcoin's hashrate has more than tripled in a year, and 30x in 2 years: BTC wasn't insecure a year ago, nor even 2 years ago.
Honestly, I don't think a small difficulty drop would be something to worry about. Hashrate massively increasing or decreasing can be a problem, but difficulty is a related, but fairly unconcerning, part of the mining equation.

This doesn't add up.
While it's possible to test what happens with 0-fee transactions, that isn't the same as spamming 83k $10 transactions ($830k per 10 minute block).
Nobody is going to be fooled by 0 fee transactions clogging the mempool. Nobody was fooled by that on Bitcoin either, the concern has been that $4 transactions weren't being processed

It's the most promising I can see for when you have a pair of entities (people, companies, funds) who wish to trade back and forth between them. It makes perfect sense to me for, say, a company and their supplier.
But for general scaling, I'm not as convinced. I really don't see how it solves the "1000 people buying 1000 cups of coffee needing 1000 on-chain transactions" problem.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:43:46
Difficulty adjusts how fast blocks can be produced, but regardless if difficulty is 1, or 2x10^^18 then you need 51% of the hashrate to attack BTC.

Nobody promised free transactions, but low transaction costs have always been part of the idea. BCH are managing it, ETH manages it, XRP, XMR, ZEC manage it.

How the fuck do you think cash works?
Bitcoin is about escaping the banks entirely, not just escaping them for large transactions.
I want to pay for my coffee with BTC. I want to pay for my house with BTC, my food. I want to do all of that without worrying whether my bank is printing more money and making me poorer. I want to do it without worrying that any money in my bank is being loaned out on sub-prime mortgages and will send my bank to the shitter along with my savings.
Bitcoin is not solely about paying for stuff? Of course it is, Bitcoin is currency, currency is about paying for stuff. What's the fucking point of escaping from the current banking sector if you don't care about paying for stuff?
Utter nonsense. Bitcoin is about paying for things.
Besides, I don't want to pay $1 for a $1000 transaction any more than I want to pay $1 for a $3 transaction.... why would I use BTC for either if other currencies (crypto or otherwise) can do it with a $0.05 fee?
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:24:45
You've got one major factor wrong here. It's not a case of "see if the last 6 blocks took &gt;12 hours, reduce difficulty 20%, then wait for another 6 blocks at 80% difficulty" - rather, the difficulty adjusts in a **rolling** 12 hour period.
So after 6 blocks, the 7th will be -20% difficulty. If the delta between blocks 1-7 is still above 12 hours, block 8 will provide a further 20% difficulty, repeat until the 6-block time is &lt;12 hours.
- Block 7 = 80% of original difficulty
- Block 8 = 64%
- Block 9 = 51.2%
- Block 10 = 40.1%
- Block 11 = 32.8%
etc etc etc. It drops very quickly once started
So after 3 blocks from block 7, you've already halved the block time.
This means BCC/H will drop to 2 hours per 6 blocks within a few days. After which point regular difficulty will take over.
It's worth noting, though, that with 2 hour blocks, BCC/H has the same transaction capacity as BTC does with 15 minute blocks.
So throughput is around the same within a few days, although confirmations will take longer.

That's rather my point, though - the main scaling problem, as I see it, is lots of individual, unlinked transactions... not a few pairs of entities with a large number of transactions between them
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:32:43
On the BTC blockchain, blocks were being solved every 20 minutes.
On the BCH chain, blocks were being solved every 2+ hours.
With the same difficulty.
It's nothing to do with having a higher probability on the billionth try, it's to do with having 6x more tries without someone else solving the block first, because there were fewer other people trying.
You have the same chance every attempt: first try or 1 billionth try. The difference is that you don't get 1 billion tries, you get 6 billion.
Of course, I'm ignoring variance here and assuming that luck plays no part, because otherwise we massively over complicate things outside the scope of the discussion, so let's just assume the miner would have had equal luck regardless, I think that's fair.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:42:38
If you don't understand the real value proposition of Ethereum, it's because you haven't looked at it properly.
Go look at the companies hiring Ethereum developers right now. Go look at the foundation's partners. Go look at the fact Etheroll is making money and paying dividends out, right now, based on smart contracts.
Ethereum has value all of it's own.
As for the rest - I think most are hanging on the coat tails of BTC, but Monero certainly has it's own unique selling point of enhanced privacy. I can certainly see it, or another crypto like it, surviving: I'm just not sure which.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:21:22
I'll concede the point on hard fork vs soft fork, then, and that SW doesn't move away from the consensus rules. But it clearly moves further from the technical spirit of BTC: and although some of the that is "careful engineering", there's also a chunk of luck that it can be done that way without requiring a hard fork.
So okay, I'll agree that in this one particular example, SW manages to work within the framework of consensus rules: but I think it's a rather pedantic argument that a soft-fork gains precedence over a hard-fork. Both BCH and SegWit are going to fundamentally change the way blocks scale, they just do so in slightly different ways. I don't think it's possible to honestly, with a straight face, argue that an 8MB block is somehow more of a technical divergence than SegWit.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:33:02
I can see the logic behind that, but my argument would be that after major splits in both BTC and ETH, it should now be an assumed part of crypto that some kind of fork ID is inherent to the implementation.
If you want to lay claim to being the original chain, the obvious solution would be to add a "ForkID: 0", "ForkID: BASE", or "ForkID: BitCoin", and then anyone else would have to use a different identifier, showing that they came later?
The point is that "I don't want to lose face" seems, to me, be a terrible argument for avoiding a technically sound, minor change that provides significant protection for your users.
I do see that it's a tacit admission that you acknowledge forks are possible... but BCH happened, denying that isn't going to change anything. I'd rather build a robust BTC that users can trust, and let other forks/chains succeed or fail on their own merits, or lack thereof: they aren't BTC's problem, BTC users are BTC's problem - and solid replay protection benefits them.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:47:49
I'll use a Ledger here for the example, rather than the Trezor, just because I don't own a Trezor so can't comment as confidently on it. This is roughly my technique for securing my HW wallet, and although it takes a small amount of preparation and thought, it probably took me less than half a day and now I can basically forget about it.


I put a small amount of money in the "main" wallet and use the "plausible deniability" PIN - which has 100 million possibilities and resets with 3 PIN entries. But even if I did assume the Ledger was going to be compromised, 100 million guesses would take more than enough time for me to discover the break in, restore my wallet elsewhere (or use my spare) and move the funds out.


I use the spare Ledger stored at a family member's house, or I restore either a desktop wallet or a new Ledger from the seed, no problem


My family member's house with my spare Ledger burns down on the same day as my house, 4 miles apart? Okay, that's unlikely - but I retrieve portions of the seed from my families and friend's houses and rebuild a new ledger or desktop wallet from it. No problem.
*My seed is split into thirds, A, B, C. No person has more than two of these thirds, eg AB, BC, or AC: so I can reconstitute them from any 2, but not from one alone. No two people who know each other have different pieces. For the whole "Your house burns down, their house burns down" thing to affect me I'd have to lose a minimum of 4 different houses (plus my own), 2 of which are in different towns entirely,  plus my solicitors office. If that happens, fuck it, destiny wants to make me poor.


None of my passwords are only in memory. The seed is stored as above, and the PIN is stored with my solicitor, with strict instructions to release it only to me on request, or on my death or situations like the above. No problem.


As above: reconstitute the seed as explained in my will (the solicitor has the PIN and information on who holds sections of the seed). No problem.


No single friend or family member (or even close group of these) can ever put together 3 parts of my seed: this would require my closest family working together with one of my best friends, or my best friends working with others of my best friends they will never meet. Even if they manage this, they need to persuade my solicitor to release the PIN. No problem.
In my case, I do have one member of my family with a spare Ledger, but I'm 100% sure I can trust this person: if I didn't have that, I'd forego the convenience of a spare HW wallet


Irrelevant in this example, since I'm discussing the Ledger which uses a proper secure element


Ridiculously unlikely, but as mentioned it would take 4 different houses plus my solicitors office. As above, if that happened I'll just chalk it up as destiny: we've probably been nuked anyway, who gives a shit?
The only real risk I have is that my most trusted family member (the one with the spare Ledger) manages to persuade my solicitor to release the PIN. Realistically, that's not going to happen: but I absolutely 100% trust said family member. Frankly if they needed the money that badly they'd ask for it and I'd give it to them. If you don't have a family member you can 100% trust to hold a spare wallet, though, the above all works perfectly without it: that spare wallet is purely a convenience measure for myself
The second biggest risk would be that two different groups of my best friends and close family group together to reconstitute my seed: even then, they'd have to get hold of the PIN
So we're looking at one of my friends or closest family
1. Work out how my plan for the above works
2. Identify the other groups holding the PIN (they don't know anything about it, other than "This is super important, keep it safe for me even if I die")
3. Contact them, and persuade them to betray me too (and remember, we're talking about my closest family, and closest friends in two entirely separate groups)
4. Understand how a Ledger works
5. Reconstitute the seed
6. Retrieve the PIN from my solicitor
7. Steal my money
If they are willing and able to go to those lengths to get my money, though, I'm pretty sure it would be faster and easier to come put a knife at my throat and tell me to send them my money... and again, if they need it that badly they can probably just have it.

Bitcoin has a scaling problem. We all know it, the community has been in turmoil over it for years... so his solution is to activate Segwit (giving ~3x more capacity) and then immediately cut the capacity back to where it is now by cutting the blocksize by ~3x?
Utterly crazy.

Not really - the legacy transactions would just end up expensive by comparison and market forces will push people to move.
We'll see this with SegWit and then later with an improved signature system. I don't think any of these solutions are the full scaling solution, but they can minimize the block size increases required and that's generally a good thing.
At the end of the day, having to make one transaction to the new system isn't a big deal

Some do, others don't: from what I can see, all the wallets I use base theirs off the mempool. I can clearly see the fee rise and fall in proportion to the mempool size even when actual mined transactions are higher or lower.
And let's add in the fact that it makes no sense for miners to waste fees by sending funds to themselves... all they're doing there is losing out both on the fee, and on the opportunity cost (it takes slightly longer to build a full block: that gives a tiny amount of time for other miners to find the block while you're processing your own transactions)

I work in software. I work in tightly controlled medical software, in fact.
Replay protection, however, needs very little work to be done securely. Look at BCH/BTC protection: it's literally a tiny change to transaction inputs. That's literally all you need: you change the transaction format on both chains, which changes the signatures such that neither can be replayed on the other because the signature doesn't match.
If you're telling me you work in software and couldn't make and thoroughly test that change in 3 months, you need a new career - replay protection isn't complex.

I can't say for sure, but most reputable exchanges keep your BTC in cold storage and use their own funds to "bridge" your transactions - e.g. You send 1 BTC, but they actually send one of theirs and then retrieve yours a few hours later from cold storage to replace it.
With unusually high volume they may run out of "hot wallet" coins and have to retrieve more. Sometimes this may take longer than normal, especially if the timing is unexpected (even something as simple as the person needing to authorise it being on lunch). Normally you'd never notice delays because they use their hot wallet, but on this occasion you do for the reasons above
Although that's just my speculation based on how some exchanges run, feel free to put a foil hat on :)

I agree that perhaps how fees work should be looked at - but at the same time, fees should be set at a level to make mining profitable with whatever demand the market currently has.
Supply and demand makes sense with a naturally limited commodity - but block space is artificially limited. If fees are high because of demand, just increase the supply.

Yes. In fact, forget "credited" - nobody credited anything, it just happened as part of the nature of the fork. BCH took a direct copy of the blockchain, with ALL previous transactions and balances.
Any transactions before the fork exist on both. Any transactions after the fork exist only on the blockchain it was made on.
Your key now works, entirely independently, on both blockchains with the balance based on the blockchain at the time of the fork, plus or minus any transactions made after the fork.
Imagine we both have a piece of paper that says `Audigex, 10, ImAjustin 20`, and our keys allow us to access that balance.
We both take a copy of this. I call mine AudiCoin, you call yours JustinCoin.  You have 20 AudiCoins (on my chain) and 20 JustinCoins (on yours). I have 10 AudiCoins (on my chain) and 10 JustinCoins (on yours).
We can both see our balance on either chain with our key, though, because it's just a perfect copy. Up to now, the balances are the same, and work with the same key, but they're only the same because nobody has done anything yet.
I then sell you 5 of my AudiCoins for one JustinCoin, and we both update our balances.
My piece of paper now says `Audigex 5, ImAjustin 25`. Yours says `Audigex 11, ImAjustin 29`
You can check either balance with the same key, but the balances are no longer related - they are different coins.
Now let's say on my chain, I add a new user who just mined an AudiCoin. Now my paper has `Audigex 5, ImAjustin 25, MinerDude 1` - but your paper doesn't change, and MinerDude doesn't gain a JustinCoin just because he got an AudiCoin. His new key doesn't work on your chain at all (well, it does, but it has no transactions, so it has a 0 balance)

You're assuming their economic incentives are as simple as "profits from the next block". This is clearly a flawed assumption.
Those miners may believe the BCH chain carries other economic benefits for them. For example if they hold a large amount of BCH, or if they feel it has greater long term potential and that therefore the BCH they mine at a loss(/small profit) now, will in future be worth more than the BTC they could mine at a profit(/larger profit) now.
You're oversimplifying the concept of economic incentives. If those miners had 500 BTC and exchanged that into 5k BCH (plus their 500 from the fork), they may have very strong incentives to see the BCH chain survive.

Then BTC difficulty would drop later
People are getting far too hung up on hashpower balance IMO. As long as BTC hashpower doesn't crash to the point the network is unusable (unlikely), then it doesn't **really** matter: BTC currently has 30x more hashpower than 2 years ago, we can afford to lose some.
The only likely difference would be that markets may re-evaluate their confidence in each coin a little based on the hashpower: but BCH is still only at 25% of the total BCH/BTC hashpower, so it's unlikely to produce a "flippening" of value

People are not generally "using" bitcoin. Most of us are holding it, and sending a few transactions around to move funds... but BTC is far too expensive to "use"
If I "used" BTC like I use my credit card, I'd have clocked up $50 of fees today. That's $1500 a month just to be able to spend my money.... you're seriously saying that people will be willing to do that long term?
For one transaction to move my funds from an exchange to my hardware wallet, or from my hardware wallet to an exchange... yeah, I might take the hit, but I won't be pleased about it. But if it comes to a point where I have to actually **use** crypto day to day, I'd make one transaction to an exchange, swap my BTC for something else, and use that instead.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:50:26
To be honest I'd rather it didn't - if we hit $5.8m Bitcoin is worth something like the entire value of current money or something ridiculous... in which case something has gone very badly wrong in the world economy and we have bigger problems
I go with $100k as being optimistic-sensible, and somewhere north of there is where I'll be taking most of my investment, and $1m being the "I will leave 1 BTC invested just in case, no matter what".

It's only due in 3 months, so replay protection can be improved rapidly. BCH has shown how easily replay protection can be done. I'm not sure that stands up tbh
As for the lack of immediate need: there's also the question of potential capacity to me. If somewhere like Walmart announces tomorrow they will accept BTC, we'd likely see an influx. Admittedly that's an extreme case, but I think we need to be ready for more capacity ASAP: anything else smacks of lack of ambition and foresight
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:21:49
Most people aren't using BTC as a currency, we're holding it and speculating on future value. But for that to make any sense, we need to actually ensure BTC **HAS** future value. And that means being able to use it.
Admittedly 24 channels per day sounds excessive: but 1/8th of that would be 1GB blocks, for 4 channels per day. That sounds more reasonable for a typical user

If ALL miners were on board with this then yes, it could be manipulated
But as long as some remain honest, they will simply snap up the abandoned profits during the periods the bad actors are trying to "game" the system. The hashrate of the honest groups would counteract the dishonest hashrate.
It would basically need one moderate sized pool to act against the gaming, and that would dampen the manipulation enough to make it basically pointless

Warning: this post contains back-of-napkin math, please don't take it as being a detailed accounting
Current 1MB non-SW blocks hold ~2k transactions. Let's, for the sake of argument, take away the "newly minted BTC/BCH" as part of the block reward, and assume that we have to cover the current ~$50k reward using only transaction fees. We'll ignore inflation too, for simplicity.
So the proposition: Using only a standard, 100% full BCH or BTC-SegWit block, how much would each transaction fee have to be to maintain the current $50k block reward?
32MB blocks, as BCH is expected to reach at some stage, would hold ~64k transactions. So that would be ~$0.78 per transaction for BCH to reward $50k per full block.
For equivalent BTC-SW1X blocks, though, that's 4k transactions per block, each transaction would  have to pay $12.50 to reward $50k per full block. That makes BTC ~16x more expensive.
Lightning Network would help, of course, assuming it works as advertised... but there's nothing stopping BCH implementing BIP 140 and using LN too, and opening/closing LN channels would still be 16x cheaper on BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:00:34

The Walmart thing was just to make the point that what appears to be a large amount of spare capacity can suddenly vanish with a surge of use: I've seen crazy BTC growth in terms of mentions on the news and various other news-like channels on social media - to some extent, that's likely to convert to usage.
LN may solve some problems, my personal opinion is that 2MB blocks aren't unreasonable. I can certainly see the reasoning for not wanting to increase like BCH has (and equally I can see the logic behind on-chain scaling), but 2MB seems pretty reasonable to me.

That's the difference between being an early adopter and a very early adopters.... less risk now, but much smaller chance of ridiculously large rewards.
Still, I believe there's a healthy profit to be made from Bitcoin: you just need to invest more money to get it, and therefore risk more. If you can put down a few thousand dollars now, my personal prediction is that you'll be able to buy a new car with it in a few years time. Maybe even upgrade a larger house (but probably not buy a whole house)

Those of us who think that it was quite a good compromise
I can see the concerns behind 8MB blocks: but Segwit2X gives the transaction throughput (for lightweight nodes) at the equivalent of 6MB blocks, but in 2MB blocks... that seems like a good thing to me.
IMO, Segwit2X isn't necessarily "big blockers", there are a lot of people who don't believe 8MB was necessary, but think that even with Segwit, 2MB would be beneficial in the medium term.
LN potentially solves some problems, but not all.
IMO, Segwit2X is the most "sensible, but attached to reality" approach: there's a reason it was chosen as a compromise.
In a good compromise, nobody is happy: but you normally end up with a better end result. IMO, 8MB and Segwit1MB are both worse solutions long term than Segwit2X was.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:20:11
That link is factually wrong. Segwit is not a block size increase.
Segwit increases the number of transactions in a block, which produces a similar end result to increasing block size: although only if the transactions included are all SegWit, and the actual end result varies based on the transactions.
But for the sake of clarity, you should really include some of the context of the quote you give above. The next line contradicts the one you quote.




Blocks mined on Testnet suggest **2MB** is more realistic than 4MB, for a SW block. Which would suggest 4MB for a SW2X block. That 2MB/4MB may become 3MB/6MB under good conditions, but 4MB/8MB will almost never be seen except under ideal circumstances

I think the thing people forget is that you can spend and hodl at the same time.
My theory is
- buy new BTC to the value of what I want to buy
- use the BTC to buy it
That way I'm still holding the same investment, but I'm promoting crypto.
If you can buy it with Bitcoin, and can afford the TX/exchange fees, buy it with Bitcoin and you're helping your own investment
I even use different wallets: my investments live in cold storage, and I buy smaller amounts of crypto to spend each month. Anything I don't spend, goes into cold storage when I buy the next month's (and usually buy some more for my investment, too)

With 1% of the BTC network hashrate, it would be something like 3 days before 1 hour blocks (1 hour blocks having 33% more throughput than BTC did yesterday, albeit with higher transaction latency). That means &lt;3 days for a useable network.
Right now it appears that BCC/H has ~2.5-3% of the BTC hashrate. That should mean a ~11 hour first block, and a useable network within a couple of days.
The first 2-3 blocks are the big "painful" part: after that, although the next few blocks are not "useful" in terms of latency, they are short enough that the rest of the process speeds up significantly.
We're looking at a couple of days of long blocks, then a few more days to adjust properly, after which BCC/H is up and running

Even if you got in at $50, by the time it hit $50,000 you'd probably be taking financial advice
I think the issue here is that if you invested enough to be making $1m by now, you'd be aware of your investment (not many people will forget about a $500+ investment)
Those who are likely to make $1m are therefore probably those who invested more like $50-100: but if you invested little enough to forget about it and return 6 years later, you probably didn't invest enough for truly crazy gains (although $100k is certainly not to be sniffed at)

I'll agree that's probably my third risk. Although I make a policy of not using my cold storage wallet after Ledger firmware upgrades for a few weeks: that's what my "day to day use" phone wallet is for. That massively increases my chances of someone noticing the hack first.
Since we're talking about retirement investment, I figure the subjects of this thread are probably going to hit their cold storage wallets even less often than I am, so that's a fairly low risk attack vector
The point is that, as you seem to have agreed, the above is probably "secure enough" for a moderate holding. If my holding increased, I'd likely reduce the proportion of my seed in any given place (eg any person has at most 6 words) which makes recovering it slightly more of a hassle, but massively increases the security in terms of needing to be betrayed by 3 or 4 of my friends and family.
Nothing is without risk, but IMO the above setup (which took me an hour or two to setup) is probably safer than trusting a third party company not to get hacked and lose all my funds.

A technically coherent case to make? There's no technical question here - Bitcoin began with 32/36MB (or ballpark there) block sizes, and the 1MB limit was added as a temporary measure while BTC was growing and spamming the chain was as close to free as to make no difference.
1MB is an arbitrary temporary figure, why does there need to be a "technically coherent" case made for increasing an arbitrary limit slightly, but remaining between 1/18th and 1/16th of the original value?

With 300 PH/s, out of a global 6000 PH/s, he would expect to mine 5% of the blocks in a given period. In 12 hours, that's ~72 blocks, so he would expect to mine 3.6
I can see where your logic comes from, but you aren't factoring in that the BCH blocks took much longer than 15 minutes, so his pool had longer to find them than they normally would. Around 1/3 of his blocks from BCH would have, on the BTC network, been found by someone else first, leaving him with 3.6 blocks

Audi is from the root audio (Although I do happen to drive an Audi, I'm not a car buff and the name is unrelated.
I'm a developer by trade, and I'm not saying there is no technical discussion to be had: but what I am saying is this
Bitcoin was created with a 32/36MB (I'm never quite clear on which) block size. The 1MB limit was added as a temporary anti-spam measure, and was clearly stated as being temporary
As such, I'm baffled by the opposition to 2MB, considering that no technical explanation has ever been given by Core as to why they are unwilling to increase the block limit when it would still be 1/16 or 1/18th of the original block limit. Surely the default position is that removing a temporary anti-spam limit is fine, although perhaps it's worth doing so slowly to avoid allowing spam back in if that's a concern.
If the temporary limit is not to be lifted when clearly needed, it seems to me that the justification needs to come from the side opposed to it.
At the end of the day, I will be entirely unsurprised if it turns out that one or more of the Core devs stand to make a lot of money from off-chain transactions of some sort. I can entirely understand objection to huge blocks, but I'm yet to see a single reasonable argument for avoiding 2MB blocks.
My technical argument for &gt;1MB blocks is simple: they were the original plan, already tested and known to work, and would solve current problems in a simple way. Take a problem, solve it in a simple way: that's the basis of most programming. I do concede to the huge blocks argument and agree that 100MB blocks could quickly become unwieldy, but 2MB is not a huge block, it's a very modest increase and would pair well with SegWit to give 5 years worth of headroom while we properly evaluate off-chain solutions and other potential ways of scaling on-chain, if there are any

You don't, but it would make them instant suspects if someone's wallet was stolen from, and would have a hell of a job laundering it enough when it can be traced from both ends, source and withdrawal
But what you CAN do is generate a BIP44 seed (I think it's 44) on another offline machine and import it to the ledger, before reformatting the machine to ensure security
That seed is newly generated but not generated by the Hardware Wallet. This means the provider would have to send it back "home" and you can see this attempt on your network

It's extremely unlikely to come under Income Tax in the UK if the coins were mined. Income Tax would only cover if your main income is trading.
In fact, HMRC generally doesn't count coins from mining at all, though, as noted in Brief 9


But if they do you'd be looking at Capital Gains Tax and we used a "£1" purchase pricefor BTC now worth £4m, worst-case CGT liability would be about £1.15m. $4m would be sligthly different, but that's roughly ballpark

BitPay seems sensible - can you use it for (customer side) non-BitPay wallets and cards, though?
It seems good in that you can receive some of your income in BTC and some in fiat, but if it only works with their own wallet and card it seems limited at best: As a customer I'd prefer something where I can pay using a QR code from any wallet I like

I detailed my thoughts a little above, but TL;DR
The Ledger has a nicer feel and "feels" nicer (both hardware and to interact with), but not by a huge amount. Considering it's €20 cheaper, that's basically a decent reason to own it anyway.
The more contentious reason is the recent messing around in the BCH/BTC fork. If you really hate BCH, this may even be a positive: as a neutral observer who just wants to use my crypto, though, I found it distasteful and unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:05:09
The first one, sure - I can't work out how it does the second though
On the first point, both parties create the channel and can then make various off-chain transactions between them, only submitting the final (or rather, current) total at any given point
On the second, though, you'd still presumably need a transaction for each (or at least, a large transaction combining all those inputs): it doesn't compress in the same way other than perhaps not needing to repeat the output address for each input: but that's a relatively small saving

SegWit saves roughly 2/3 of the space, meaning SegWit 1mb blocks are roughly equivalent to 3mb blocks, although there can be variations

The thing to get your head around here is that your wallet doesn't hold your funds. Your wallet holds your private key, which allows you to access your funds.
It's like how your debit card doesn't actually have $100 on it: your debit card proves to the bank that you are the person authorized to take $100 out of the account.
The blockchain is on every node in the BTC network, and that's where the details of how much money is "in your account" lies

You can choose your fee, but blocks are currently (possibly always, we'll see) 1MB. So the miners start with the most expensive fee and include that, then the next, and keep going until they have a full block.
If your fee is lower than 1MB worth of other transactions, you have to wait until the next block, but there's no guarantee you'll actually get picked up at all if transactions are added as fast as they're processed

Okay, that's entirely out of scope here... nothing here is about transaction rates. BCH has 30k transactions a day. But my point is that BCH isn't having problems with the bug described above, despite larger blocks. If the argument against larger blocks is "But that's twice as much space for these buggy transactions", but BCH has fixed the bug... why can't BTC fix the bug for non-SW transactions too? And then the objection goes away


It has 26% of the hashrate, and more than BTC had a year ago. It has plenty


Not really. "Unknown" miners do account for 50% of the last 100 blocks, true, but it's fairly apparent that "Unknown" is at least two major players and at least some others. BCH has 5 major pools actively mining, and considering it has only been profitable for a few days, that really isn't a sensible measurement anyway. Ask that question again in a month.

They'd need to produce &gt;6 blocks per 12 hours, which would require enough hashrate to produce 7-8 to cover typical variance. That's a lot of hashrate wasted that could be put to better use making profits on the BTC chain.
Why would they want to lose money in order to lose money in the future? Whoever did this would have to do it for long enough for the normal difficulty adjustment to kick in (well over a month), and would lose a lot of money doing so.
It's possible, but you'd need a lot of spare cash

2X is, to my understanding, 2MB (2X larger than 1MB) blocks with a number of transactions equivalent to ~7-8 MB due to SegWit, and a total payload of ~7-8MB due to the witness section: although I might be confusing teminology here.
Segwit = 3-4x as many transactions per MB, 2X = 2x 1MB blocks, for a total of 2MB blocks. That's my understanding of the term Segwit2X
As far as I understood, the core "block" is 2MB, and that's what would be present on all nodes: while the full 8MB (block + witness data) would only be held on full nodes.

So your entire argument there is "They are the ones forking"
Again I'll ask - why does responsibility for securing the network fall only on the forking side? Surely any vaguely responsible group should secure things for **their own** users, even if that security is only needed due to the actions of others?
I lock my house to stop a 3rd party from stealing my TV, not to stop myself stealing it.
Regardless of who is instigating the fork, it is the responsibility of **any** party involved (even unwillingly involved) to ensure the system is secure for their users.
"But they're the ones forking" is whingey bullshit that solves nothing for users and will cost real people, real money

It can if EVERY miner is on board with the play.
But if even a fairly small amount of hashpower doesn't want to jump on board, they will switch to the more profitable chain and scoop up the profits.
So while the system is possible to "game", it only works if nearly everyone plays: otherwise those trying to manipulate the system may find that all they did was throw away profit

So what happens if 50% of your nodes disagree with the other 50%? Which 50% are correct? The ones with the unchanged rules? Why?
What happens if 60% of nodes choose the new rules? What about if 50% choose new rules, but spin up another 1000 nodes and therefore have 60% of the total (despite there being 110% the number of nodes) - the network has no way to know the difference.
Or perhaps the truly tricky question: What happens if all your nodes change to new rules because of some previously unknown bug, but 50% choose one solution and 50% choose another?
Both of these situations create two forks with valid blocks according to their own rules. You aren't answering the question of **which fork is correct?** - Nodes enforce the rules, sure - but where the nodes disagree, how do we as a community know/decide which nodes are validating the correct rules? How do we know which is Bitcoin and which is the altcoin?
Price? Market cap? Daily volume? The person with the Github account ownership decides? Or is it, as the whitepaper says, the chain with the higher Cumulative Proof of Work? If not, why not?
So yeah, answer this
**What happens if all your nodes change to new rules because of some previously unknown bug, but 50% choose one solution and 50% choose another?** Where neither option is in the whitepaper, and both appear to be technically sound from a security and usability perspective: they're just different approaches. How do you choose?

Nope, worst case is that the sector is over-valued and you lose almost all of your investment.
I personally think that's unlikely, but if I thought it was likely I wouldn't be here, so be careful of potential echo chamber risks: none of us would be here if we thought BTC would fail.
20% of liquid assets is fairly sensible, though - worst case you lose 20% of your accessible savings: unpleasant, but unlikely to ruin your life.
Altcoins could give larger rewards, although I'd suggest that people have caught on and that most of them at least roughly reflect their current short-medium term risk/reward. The problem with alts is that there are a lot of them, you'd have to put a little money into all of them for low risk, or a lot of money into a few of them for high reward: but you probably can't do both.
Still, your approach seems sensible enough to me, with the caveat that "Don't assume BTC/Crypto is a guaranteed store of wealth"

Yup. I bought both to test, sold the Trezor because the Ledger felt more premium and the apps are nicer to use. It's also €20 cheaper: I sold the Trezor and got more than I bought the Ledger for.
If you don't care about BCH/BTC drama, stop reading here (although I'm not a BCH fan whining, nor am I an opponent)
Recently, I decided to get a second for convenience. I was originally going to go with the Trezor (on the theory that using both gives me more backup if one company goes bust and their apps die), but Trezor's customer service has put me off.
Specifically, and although I know this may not be a popular opinion in this sub, I've been annoyed at Trezor playing politics in the BCH/BTC split. I don't care which they support, messing about with naming conventions and arsing around on whether they'll even support the other coin isn't okay.
I seriously don't have a preference on the BTC/BCH split, but I do expect companies I purchase from to keep their politics (whether that's government or Bitcoin) to themselves and focus on supporting me as their customer.
Trezor didn't do that, Ledger did, so I bought another Ledger. For all I know, Ledger support one side of the fork more than the other, but if they did then they didn't shove it in my face, they just supported my needs promptly and effectively.
To be clear, and in the interest of fairness, the devices are both good and are down to preference. I had a slight preference purely on the devices, and now have a further preference based on their customer service games: but if the latter doesn't bother you, you won't go too far wrong with either choice

I know the difficulty will increase: but that's in line with current hashpower. If the hashpower stays the same, then profitability over the next few difficulty adjustments will just balance out with the hashpower.
If hashpower migrates back to BTC due to lower profitability, BCH's difficulty parachute will kick in to reduce block times.

For the relatively small amount of work required, though, surely that's not unreasonable? Especially considering it would only need to be done once.
The change could be introduced now and set to activate a month before the fork, giving wallets 2 months to incorporate it in their next update, and then a month where those wallets are basically useless unless updated.
I know it's not ideal, but it seems like that would be far less of a headache to do now than later. If done now you eliminate the "no ForkID" chain entirely, because all implementations will default to using it. If done later, the first fork to refuse to implement replay protection could be a major problem and could even lay claim to the "no ForkID" implementation if BTC is forced to implement replay protection after the fact. I know that's unlikely, but who has more to lose from the chaos: an unknown new fork, or established BTC?
Remove the attack vector now, make things secure long term, and then it can basically be forgotten about in future.

Since the fork, your BCH and BTC are entirely unrelated. There's absolutely no differentiation between your pre- and post-fork BTC.
You have a BTC private key, which relates to an amount of BTC on the BTC blockchain. That's your BTC balance and has no relationship with the BCH blockchain
You also have a BCH private key, which relates to an amount of BCH on the BCH blockchain. That's your BCH balance and has no relationship with the BTC blockchain
They are entirely separate entities with a shared history. The only connection right now is that those two keys may be the same.
If you mix pre- and post-fork BTC, it makes literally no difference - neither is linked with any BCH any more, neither will create any more BCH. Your BCH already exists on an entirely separate blockchain, within a different wallet that happens to have the same private key.
The only reason to move either balance is to avoid one compromised key being able to steal both your balances, if either key is compromised.

100GB SegWit blocks could handle over 1000x the peak transactions that the VISA network handles. Even for the most ambitious of Crypto supporters, that's a little on the excessive side.
Pull that back to 1% (10x VISA peak) in 50 years, and I'm sure we'll have the network infrastructure to propagate even 1GB blocks in a reasonably fast time: enough to support a dozen larger pools, at least.

Yeah I'm British so I'm fairly sure this is the case - we only pay tax on capital gains (e.g. I buy 5k, then later sell 10k, so I pay tax on the 5k gain)
The tricky part is working out what's gain, and what's spending or purchasing etc. If anything, the hard thing to avoid is accidentally (fraudulently) reducing your liability because your additional crypto purchase would appear to be an investment (reducing the delta between purchase and withdrawal) but is actually money you're spending on goods or services

Otherwise, you just appear to be either a troll, or a shill who's bailing out because you have no coherent response to a reasonable question.
If the question is intellectually dishonest, point out why: I've got no ill intention here, if there is a way to secure BTC without either BTC implementing replay protection, or requiring SW2X to do so, then I'd love to hear it.

Yes, ~130 PH/s from ViaBTC, ~30 PH/s from Bitcoin.com. Presumably some from other sources too, but those are the verifiable numbers, for ~2.8% of the BTC hashpower
Considering these first few blocks are almost certainly not profitable, and are therefore supporters of BCC/H rather than actual profit-driven miners, that's a very positive sign for BCC/H.
Once the difficulty adjusts to the hashpower, then assuming BCC/H has some value, the difficulty should adjust to make mining profitable again. The only real risk is that the value/margins are tight, meaning the rewards can only support a small number of miners. That isn't a problem of the block size, though, that would be a problem of the (BCCUSD value : block reward : ASIC hashpower) ratios.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:49:59
That's purely about the hashrate, not the difficulty.
I think people are getting bogged down in difficulty discussion here - hashrate matters: hashrate is what lets you perform an attack. Difficulty relates to price and profits, and is simply a function of hashrate.
BCH could have 1% or 200% of the BTC difficulty, it makes no difference: to attack BCH you'd still need (BCH hashrate + 1 miner) to attack it.

I think it goes without saying that decentralized systems don't scale as well - by definition: that's just the nature of them.
Equally though, I'm concerned (in a personal fashion, hopefully, rather than concern trolling) that he and the other devs are pushing us towards centralized solutions, rather than simply scaling a decentralized system as best as possible.
At the end of the day we're here to move away from centralized systems. Using Bitcoin to recreate VISA via LN (I know, gross simplification/misrepresentation - but hopefully you get the gist) just seems like a sideways step

This was true a week ago, it is no longer true.
Bitcoin Cash is 3 weeks old and rapidly becoming decentralized now that mining it has stabilized. Judging it on the first two weeks is nonsense - Bitcoin spent far longer than 3 weeks being mined by a couple of people.
[BCH last 144 blocks]( - [BTC last 24 hours]( BTC is more diverse, sure, but BCH has 7 active pools, none of which has &gt;25% of the total hashpower. That's reasonably healthy

Wow, an impressive display of "resorting to insults"
Let's work through this, then, for me and my poor thick skulled useful(?) idiot brain
- Without replay protection, everyone is vulnerable
- SW2X have stated they will not implement replay protection
So that leaves  you with two options
1. Ignore SW2X and leave yourself vulnerable, but that's okay because it's not *your* fault you're vulnerable
2. Implement the protection even though it isn't your responsibility, to keep yourself safe.
I know that ideally we'd have option 3: SW2X implements replay protection... but that's out of our control. Options 1 and 2 are the only ones in our control
So go on, which would you prefer? 1 or 2?

The more I learn, the more I'm coming up with the same query.
Lightning Network seems to do a great job where two parties wish to make a variety of payments between them, with them being able to submit it back later: eg I can make 100 transactions with you, and then we only put the net result of that on the blockchain.
But I'm still not understanding how that actually helps when 100 people wish to make a single transaction each to, for example, a coffee shop: how does LN help here? Because these seem to be the kinds of transactions that REALLY cause the scaling issue. Payments like this seem like a far more likely scenario than two parties making 100 transactions back and forth

I entirely understand that
But the problem here is that supply is not a fixed commodity: supply is blockspace, and it was only ever meant to be a temporary addition to BTC. If the supply is arbitrarily limited, increase it.
I'm not one of the "OMFG fees should always be $0" crowd, I understand and support the idea that fees should support mining: but fees should be set based on making mining profitable, not based on an arbitrary fixed block size

I'm asking the question: if not one of my three suggestions then what would your alternative be?
The white paper states that the chain with the greatest cumulative proof of work *is* Bitcoin. If Samurai, or anyone else, says otherwise - then the question is simple: If not through CPoW, how do you decide which is the valid chain?
Is the valid chain simply the one that never hard forks? Is it the one that the owners of Bitcoin.org say is valid?
I'm struggling to see how there's any way to know which is the valid chain, and am asking, in all sincerity, what you consider to be the correct answer to the question:

Parts of a transaction are not held by every node, the block itself does not contain the entire transaction. That's a clear and fairly fundamental change from the Bitcoin/Blockchain philosophy.
I'm not necessarily saying it is a bad thing: I'm not against SegWit, although I'm interested to see what happens with the porportion of full nodes to all nodes, but that's more of an academic "Who was right?" interest myself: I don't care which the result was, I'm interested to see if either BCH or SW actually fulfil the centralization fears presented by their opponents in the last year or so.
The simple fact for meis that Bitcoin originally had larger blocks and all signature data in the block. That makes Bitcoin Cash very obviously a coin which is more inline with the initial releases of Bitcoin.
It doesn't mean Segwit becomes a different coin - but where SegWit changes the blockchain/block structure, while BCH only removes a temporary restriction, I really don't see how anyone can argue that BCH differs from BTC by a greater extent than BTC-SW does: that just doesn't add up.
Although I'll add that I don't see how Satoshi's comment suggests changing the block format: it appears to refer more to the fact that a transaction can contain additional data: for example by expanding OP_RETURN, or by adding additional data fields. That's rather out of scope of this discussion though.

You need to answer this for yourself, there are no patterns here.
What do you think the market is doing? Where is the bullish sentiment coming from? Is this climb a result of people thinking "Okay, that wasn't so bad" after the BCH/BTC fork, for example, or is it a new wave of speculation and media attention because of the WannaCry Virus "profits" being in the media because they're being moved from their original wallets?
The former probably means we'll bounce off a price above $2700 (but your guess is as good as mine, in regards to what that price will be), and settle a little below it. But depending on the velocity of the climb, it may just slow down and settle on the "correct" valuation
The latter situation probably means a steep climb followed by a retraction when the attention drops.
But there are never any gaurantees: patterns in the past don't mean patterns in the future

Two weeks of mining. And the miners could easily have had enough BTC holdings to make theIr BCH worth supporting... if they even had a couple of hundred BTC before the fork, they've made a tidy profit already and now stand to profit further. The next two weeks, assuming the price stays stable, will put their mining back to break even over a month even compared to if they'd mined BTC for a month - and they can now move more hashpower over to the BCH chain which is itself more profitable that BTC right now
Frankly I think the whole "ridicule them for making a loss" thing is naive... if they haven't already made a net gain vs mining BTC during that time, they will very soon

Because despite all the promises about SW and LN reducing fees, suddenly in the last few days this sub is full of people saying "Oh wait, maybe those fees won't drop"... LN is not looking like the miracle it was originally presented as: it has potential, but it's going to take literally years for the services and scale to emerge.
A road map is all well and good, but a block size increase now would give BTC the breathing room to develop those services and protocols.

If in 2011
- You put a few hundred bucks in an experiment priced at a dollar
- Didn't sell it for $31/each
- Didn't keep it in MtGox or similar
- Never lost your wallet keys (easily done when they're taking up disk space and not worth much)
- Didn't sell in any of the subsequent bubbles etc
- Remembered whatever PINs or passwords you needed
- Didn't spend them on drugs or pizza (or drugs then pizza, if you buy the right drugs)
etc etc etc
Then yes, if you managed to avoid all of those, or if you bought $500 worth and then forgot about them in a backup, then you'd have $1.25 million.
Whether $1.25 million is enough to be set for life depends on your lifestyle and age, but I'd suggest that very few people were willing to put $500 on a $1/coin experiment, and of those, most likely sold in a previous bubble for a healthy profit, but not $1m.
But yes, those who invested $500 in 2011 and held until now probably have good money. For 2010, on the other hand, you could have bought $50 and forgotten about it in a backup, and likely have some good money lying around

I've never quite worked out why people think price follows block reward: most of the daily volume is not block rewards being sold, the supply won't suddenly half, the halvening has far less impact than that

So the devs have noticed something very important and fundamental which prevents a the 1MB limit being used, but
1. They've decided it's not worth mentioning, despite the fact it would instantly cut out a whole bunch of the scaling debate because people could look at the code and explanation and see it makes perfect sense
2. It hasn't become a problem for the BCH 8MB limit
That makes no sense on either account.

Now look above that point... very clearly the higher fee Tx are dropping away and lower fees become more feasible.
You're seeing conspiracies where it's actually market forces at play. People notice the high fees clear out so start sending lower fee amounts
Also, this could easily be something like Coinbase automatically calculating a low fee to use (Coinbase like using low fees, because it's more profitable to them). One or two exchanges adjusting their base fee downward can easily show this kind of linear increase

If the bug is fixed in SegWit, it is fixed in SegWit2X surely? And outside the superlinear validation time (solved for all implementations), you're talking about fractions of a second of extra propagation time over 15 minute blocks.
It appears to me that the issue you discuss theoretically matters with big blocks if not solved, but that both BCH and BTC-SW (and by extension, BTC-SW2X) solve the problem?
I agree that naively increasing the block size without solving that bug would have been a problem, but with it being solved then surely the objection is lifted? Of course, slightly larger blocks cause slower propagation - but that's intrinsic to higher transaction numbers: Segwit still has to propagate the full up-to-4MB block+witness data to the network, that's no different to an up-to-4MB block.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:02:31


Citation needed. Some nodes don't hold the full history (eg reduced history) but they hold the full transaction


Well it depends on how you define the block. The block that goes to ALL nodes is the 1MB without witness data.


Erm, I don't dislike SegWit? I'm not entirely convinced it's any better than BIP140 transaction format plus 2MB blocks, but I'm not against it either.


I post in in much the same way I do here - asking questions, finding interest in people's opinions. I believe neither the "miners are out to make a profit no matter what and want to manipulate us" conspiracy theory, nor the "Core only want small blocks because of their patents" conspiracy theory. I suspect both have some element of truth to them, but that neither are close to the level of conspiracy suggested. Both miners and Core could do with a bunch more transparency.
I believe I have a reasonable understanding of how SegWit works (although if you have a source for the "not all nodes hold the full transaction" then I may have to revisit some of my understanding of non-SW transactions), my questions revolve more around people claiming that large blocks have some intrinsic downside or risk other than bandwidth usage.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:36:31

@_date: 2017-08-21 16:34:27
I haven't chosen a number, and I've got no emotion driving anything here. Financially, and technically, it's clear to me that 1MB limits (or any fixed limit) are nonsensical. The system should be designed to scale with use, not based on a hardcoded limit.
Personally I believe that the block limit should be lifted and anti-spam methods should be implemented in other ways: perhaps by something resembling the difficulty calculations, whereby transaction fees are decided programatically based on some combination of transaction volumes, transaction values, and block sizes over the last x blocks.
A hard limit in code is usually a sign of an "Oh shit, fix it" response to a problem, and needs to be replaced by something better thought out.
Other types of limits would not block Lightning Network and similar off-chain solutions, but would require them to compete directly on their own benefits, rather than being a necessary default
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:06:44

1. segwit does not add a "tiny bit". It nearly doubles capacity which solves scalling problems immediately. This is not the main point of segwit but it certainly comes handy
It solves them very briefly, but we need to think long term here. LN solves some problems, but is untested and it's unclear exactly what will/won't be solved, and exactly how decentralized and trustworthy it will be.
2. and in a few years syncing, say, 1TB of transactions every 10min is madness
That's slightly ridiculous: 1TB would be a 1000000x increase in capacity: are you seriousy expecting that kind of volume "in a few years". Backbone and individual line fibre speeds are stalling, but the rollout of the fastest fibre lines has barely started. Research level fibre speeds are stalling, but real world fibre speeds are still increasing rapidly.
VISA handles 2000 transactions per second average. Bitcoin can handle 7. That means BTC needs to scale 300x. If we take SegWit as being equivalent to 3MB blocks, that would mean we need SegWit plus 100MB blocks. That's 10,000x smaller than the 1TB you're suggesting. 1TB per 10 minutes would be ridiculous, but 100MB per 10 minutes is already less than my phone can handle right now. Even for full nodes which would hold 300MB per 10 minutes, that's not too unreasonable.
Your 1TB claim here is ludicrous. 1GB blocks would be more than 10x higher than current VISA capacity, and would still be 1,000th of the "1TB in a few years" you're claiming. Please don't spread FUD
3. verifying transactions is a good point but i dont think it is that relevant. Do you verify transactions with fiat?
And this is the one I have the real problem with.
First up, if I hand you cash and you give me my change, you're damn right I verify it. I count the coins and notes myself to ensure you're giving me the right amount.
But if you're talking about my credit card then no, I don't verify transactions with Fiat: VISA does. I have to trust a third party, which most of us see as a bad thing. **That's literally the entire point of Bitcoin**
I can't verify fiat transactions, and that's why I don't trust the damn thing. I can see for myself that when I trust my bank or another third party to verify a transaction, they pull shit like fractional reserve banking etc and crash the entire economy with bad loans.
The entire point of Bitcoin is that I **CAN** verify and trust the blockchain, rather than having to rely on third parties. Your answer for that question goes against literally the whole reason I'm here: I don't want to have to trust third parties, I want to verify my transactions myself.

And how long do blocks take to propagate? How much of that is actually related to the size of the block?
All I see is the concept of "It's slower" being thrown around - is there any evidence that larger blocks propagate significantly slower? Above the order of 1 second (0.16% of income). Because I'm not sure that 0.16% of income is enough to matter to a small solo miner. And even to larger miners, that will only mean they want to be in one of the major pools... that's already the case for most, because it comes with other benefits.

How does big blocks require testing? Big blocks was how Bitcoin started, it's already tested. 1MB is an arbitrary limit introduced to minimize spam when transactions were literally free

My point is that there are 8600 nodes.
They could easily set up a bunch of servers or hire VPSs - even at $20/node/month (which would be expensive per unit), it's only $180k a month.

I've stepped back and considered it.
But we are **not** talking about miners attacking selfishly. We're talking about a **clear split in the community**.
How do you propose a clear split in the community should be handled? Do the people in control of the Github get to control the name no matter what?
What mechanism do you propose for deciding, now (BTC vs BCH), soon (BTC vs BTC2X), and well into the future for as yet unknown debates (BTC vs ???)
I'm considering things fairly, I'm not particularly a BCH, BTC, or BTC2X supporter (my own personal disclosure: I'm currently holding all the BTC and BCH I had on July 31st, and have bought more BTC since but not BCH).
So you tell me: when the community splits in 10 years on an as yet unknown question, how do you propose we decide which is the "real" bitcoin and which is the "altcoin"?
Is it based on who controls the Github and .org website? Is it the number of nodes? Market cap? Price per coin? Greatest hashpower? Greatest cumulative proof of work? A vote on Twitter?
There needs to be a mechanism to decide which side of a fork is the "real" bitcoin: what do you propose, and on what basis do you justify that choice?

While I agree that the fees need to be high enough to give a sufficient block reward, that's more of a "Tx * fee" equation.
Somehow "Tx * fee" has turned into "fees in a 1MB block" for many.
Scale to the number of transactions, and then everyone can pay a lower fee but produce the same block reward

Are you just following me around and trolling me? Nothing I said there is a rule of thumb
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:09:23
Core is blatantly, vehemently opposed to a blocksize increase.


Because there is a clear desire for it among a large proportion of the community? To me, solving that uncertainty carries great benefits, for little to no risk.
Why not lift this cloud from above the community? I can see the objection to eventual 256MB blocks, for example - but 1MB to 2MB? Not really - it's clearly an arbitrary limit, and was even stated as being temporary. 256MB may be too high, 1MB seems quite obviously too low.
And while I can see the point of saving it until another hardfork is required for a different reason, I'm also a fan of keeping things simple. I'd rather test and implement two individual changes, rather than combine them into one fork with more uncertainty
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:48:05
Of course. But the vast majority of propagation time is physical network latency, not bandwidth and processing time.
From the information I've seen, the time to validate a block is roughly 20 to 50ms above the speed of light propagation time through fibre (and that's a constant based on how far apart the nodes are). Even if we assume that scales linearly (I'd be surprised if it does) with block size, that's 40-100ms for a 2MB block over a 1MB block.
We're talking about less than 1/20th of a second extra, every 10 minutes.

I think that's a tenuous argument. BTC started with &gt;1MB blocks, the limit was added later. BCH has proven already that the limit can be removed without issue.


How? Node counts are increasing even out of proportion with other usage.
As for the rest - miners spamming blocks doesn't add up, unless they're literally all doing it: otherwise the amount they'd lose to other miners wouldn't be compensated by the amount they gain. Either way, there are simpler ways to deal with this, or complex but more comprehensive ways.
Spam is certainly an issue, but should be dealt with independently of scaling. Perhaps setting minimum TX fees based on average volume, and burning fees below a certain limit, to disincentive spamming the blockchain in order to increase that volume. Off the cuff suggestion, but the point is that spam should be dealt with as an entity itself, rather than used as a reason to avoid scaling.

Not really - mining pools aren't competitors in the same way as KFC and McDonald's. They do compete in that they want to attract more miners, but not in the same consumer bullshit way... and both are aware that it's in their interest to have a relatively balanced and diverse set of mining pools, so they have little reason to try to destabilise each other
In fact right now, it's of benefit to both to improve BCH hashrate, to give them more coins to mine in future... so working together **does** make sense here.
To use your own analogy, it's more like McDonalds posting about a petition to stop the government banning fast food, and KFC answering a question about it. Or perhaps both commenting on an article about improved welfare for chickens bred for the fast food industry.

How is BCH centralised? Since mining has been profitable (e.g. Ignoring the first 2 and a half weeks of "bootstrap" time), BCH has had a reasonably varied mining pool - right now no group or pool has &gt;25% of hashrate 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:27:44
Oh I'm certainly not suggesting the mempool is entirely legitimate: it certainly seems to fit on the timing. Just that I don't think this reasoning makes logical sense
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:20:09
Okay, so follow up question
BCH has broken from existing consensus rules with a larger block size. BTC-SW has broken from existing consensus rules with SegWit. So which one is Theseus's ship? It appears to me that this is exactly the situation you describe - BCH have taken the hull and the compass, BTC-SW has taken the masts, sails and rudder (or vice versa, no metaphors here regarding rudders and compasses), and now both are claiming to be the original ship.
Fundamentally, SegWit is a larger change than an 8MB block, considering that BTC originally had larger (36MB?) blocks, but that SegWit is entirely new.
In my opinion, neither is truly Bitcoin continued, but the one with the higher eventual proof of work and daily traded volume is the successor to Bitcoin: but I feel like whichever side loses will be trying to find new measures by which to justify their own existence. For Core, that will be ownership of .org and the GitHub, for BCH that will be the similarity to the whitepaper... but either would be wrong without users, hashrate, and trade volume

Mining costs (hardware, power) exist in fiat, and as such only make sense in fiat.
Until I can buy mining hardware and electricity in BTC, using BTC block rewards is complete nonsense... I don't care if I'm making 0.0001 BTC or 50 BTC, I care that I can exchange enough of that BTC to fiat to pay my electricity bills and hardware costs, and leave me a profit (which I can exchange to fiat or keep as BTC)
The same applies to users: I can buy some things in BTC, but 99% of my actual real world purchases are in fiat (or using something like a BitPay card to convert to fiat, which boils down to the same end result). While I agree that sat/B is the official denomination, what matters to me is how much I'm paying within my real world frame of reference: GBP (fiat). This is the same reason the front page is usually full of fiat-based price discussion. We'd all love to use crypto day to day, but the reality is that it's mostly an investment and novelty to the vast majority of us
TL;DR: Electricity bills demand fiat. Until that changes, fees only make sense to miners in fiat. Most people need fiat to pay their mortgage, bills, and food costs. Until that changes, fees only matter to users in fiat.

Apart from that whole thing where Satoshi specifically stated that that would be a problem, because it's easy for a bad actor to spin up a bunch of nodes. There's a reason Bitcoin is based on Proof of Work, not just one-vote-per-IP... and that's because the latter is cheap and easy to attack

My only opinion in this whole thing is that SegWit seems a little over complicated for the benefits. Not "fatal flaw" levels of over complicated, just "hmm, is this not a tad over-engineered?"
Other than that I'm holding both coins, and learning about the nuances of the directions they're likely to go.
Which part of that is triggering?
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:25:51
Two comments on the front page are Bitcoin price discussion (new highs), one is a sensible discussion of how SegWit works, one is a discussion of block size increases in BTC. And one is an (admittedly possibly negatively spun) discussion of the fact that if you send a SegWit transaction, the change is sent to a non-SegWit address, which kind of defeats at least part of the low fee argument.
That's 5 on the front page - Those seem reasonable enough?
It's clearly more heavily weighted to BCH, and there's also a fair bit of anti-Core and anti-BTC sentiment - but there is also genuine discussion of Bitcoin too
I do agree that it's becoming more of a circle jerk, and only time will tell if that's a temporary situation after the fork, but there is still plenty of actual Bitcoin discussion on the other sub
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:28:08
He saw the problem and implemented a TEMPORARY limit. Emphasis temporary.
BCH traded more a couple of days ago than BTC did, so the "nobody uses it" argument doesn't add up. 
And if you're using exchanges as an example of off chain scaling being the answer: BTCe, MtGox are very good examples of why that's a terrible idea.
I will never support off chain scaling that relies on third parties rather than my own private keys. If I wanted a third party trust model I'd use my Visa card. That's why I find lightning network interesting, but my opinion is that a short term 2MB block size wouldn't make any significant difference to security or centralisation, while giving enough time for the community to properly look into second later solutions and do them right.
As it is, most people barely know what LN is, and almost nobody in the general community truly understands it. 2MB gives us time to digest and understand it properly 
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:44:12
That's because Ethereum grew with fewer pools, not because of the faster blocks. ETH is much younger than BTC, and only recently exploded onto the mainstream (within crypto) scene: ETH is diversifying, and it will soon need more than 2 pools to 51% attack ETH too. I can't see how that would link back to difficulty: it's correlation, not causation.
I do see your point that miners may coalesce into pools more (eg less solo miners) but equally I don't see why pools would particularly need to combine. If blocks get under 10 seconds then yeah, propagation times can start to cause more problems: and under 1 minute we may see a few more orphaned blocks.
My main point here, though, is that nobody's intending to drop BTC blocks to &lt;1 minute: we're just talking about reducing the difficulty enough to keep block times at the current ~15 minute target. I agree that if the block time plummets then there could be problems of miners combining into pools - but not if the difficulty reduces to balance dropping hashrate
It's really not that long ago that slushpool had a huge proportion of BTC hashrate
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:00:32
That doesn't add up - blocks are going through, and each has more capacity than the current requested transactions
If you believe BCC will crash, then you could argue that exchanges who haven't enabled deposits and trading are the only thing saving it. But slow blocks don't add up - there have already been about 10, none close to full - and most trading doesn't rely on block based transactions anyway - exchanges handle their trades off-chain
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:14:10

I don't need to audit their books, but I need to trust that the second layer is guaranteed to be accurate. I do believe this will be the case, I'm just yet to see exactly how it works.
My main concern, though, is that it's not actually going to be particularly useful for "cash-like" payments. I don't see how 100m cups of coffee at $1 each actually fit LN's proposal: LN seems to fit perfectly between, for example, the Coffee Shop and their suppliers, with lots of transactions back and forth - but how do 100 million individual $1 transactions fit in?
I can see it working with intermediaries like BitPay, but that requires trusted third parties, in which case... why bother with Bitcoin at all?
What I'd really like to see is someone present to me how side chains solve the problem of 100 people paying $1 each to a merchant, requiring 100 transactions.
To be clear, I've got no particular reason to dislike LN and similar side-chain technology: I'm just not sure it's been shown clearly to the community, how they solve some of the problems they are being presented as solving.

Hypothetical scenario:
A bug appears in Bitcoin. There are two possible solutions, both of which deviate from the original specification by the same amount.
For the sake of argument, let's say that solution A involves adding 1 to the block hash, and that solution B subtracts 1. I know this is silly, but for the purposes of making it clear that there's no technical, security, useability, performance reason to prefer one over the other, and that they both differ from the status quo to the exact same degree. Let's call these BTCA and BTCB
So we have two solutions which both differ, but we have to choose one because otherwise our money can be stolen (curse those people who can crack SHA256 but not add or subtract 1 from the result).
Precisely 50% of nodes and 50% of miners pick each solution. No users move their money between the two chains because we have no idea which of BTCA or BTCB will survive.
How do you decide which is "real"? Nodes? Miners? Price? The person in charge of Github integrating one or other solution?
The whitepaper suggests that this decision is made using the longer chain, with no 
mention of most nodes, highest price, most users etc.
I'm struggling to see why that, therefore, isn't the case for BCH vs SegWit? Surely SegWit differs from the status quo by a greater degree than 8MB blocks do - so if BCH gets more hashpower and spins up more nodes, is it Bitcoin? If not, why not?

Okay, I can see that being a reasonable argument.
But wouldn't basic replay protection (eg using a FORKID type flag like BCH) be fairly quick to implement? If starting right now, that's 2 months to make major inroads on upgrading nodes. I'd also assume that the replay protection could be setup to only activate once 95% of nodes are signalling for it?
Worst case: 95% of miners don't upgrade and the flag isn't activated, no harm done and at least we tried
Best case: People realize the danger, upgrade their nodes, and we have replay protection.
I can't see any reason not to at least make the attempt
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:30:10
As long as you owned the keys prior to the first post-fork block, you can do it at any time.
There's absolutely no rush unless you're desperate to trade BCH: take your time and do it right.
But it's pretty simple
- Open your wallet
- Send your BTC to another address with a different private key
- Copy your old private key/seed into a new wallet
- Send your BCH to a new address, or use that address (your call on how much you care about security)
- Use both
You don't even necessarily need to do this **as long as you trust both your wallets**. If you trust them both, you can just import the private keys and use both. The problem comes if you don't trust one or the other... although then I'd ask, why are you using it anyway?

My assumption would be that the other coin is likely inflationary (or possibly with variable inflation rates) with a focus on keeping prices relatively stable and avoiding the kind of 0.00001 BTC transaction we see.
Gold has only recently become valuable in the industrial world - and I'd argue that it was used for jewellery because it was valuable (that is to say, to show off your wealth), rather than being valuable  because of any inherent cosmetic trait.
Perhaps we'll all start wearing necklaces with a built in display that displays our Bitcoin wallet balances, replacing gold.

I understand what you're saying, and there's certainly variance within "typical" - but it's reasonable enough, IMO, to take a typical single-signature transaction, a single change address, and choosing a reasonable fee in order to get into one of the next few blocks.
I do agree that the stated price won't ever cover all the bases, but it's a sensible enough frame of reference to compare over time.
At the end of the day, I think we all understand what's being said when we talk about $4 TX fees

I don't hold XMR: I may well do so once the Ledger has a wallet for it, but for now I'm entirely happy to disclose that my portfolio is, according to Blockfolio right now, ~75% BTC, ~15% ETH, ~9% BCH, and &lt;1% in a few shitcoins and ERC20 tokens just to play with
Not that I think many people in Venezuela are looking at my posts on Reddit for financial advice.
I love this sub though. On one hand I've got people bitching at me for the fact most of my post references BTC and the current high fees probably don't suit Venezuela, and then when I suggest an altcoin as being more suitable, with clear justifications, that's not allowed either.

So it's more of a "A whole bunch of people are involved" like the Internet, rather than "Everyone is involved" like BTC?
Personally I'd rather see side chains as a mixture (depending on the nature of the transactions) of
1. Smart contracts between two or a few parties (easy enough)
2. Aggregation of small transactions between many users (many-many, and/or one-many, and/or many-one), in a way that they can be recorded in fewer transactions but are historically verifiable.
I'm not going to pretend I've worked how to make the latter feasible, but it smacks me as the biggest "This is what crypto needs"
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:58:00
I'm assuming that the $450 price is artificial, and that unless your BCH are already on an exchange they will not make that price. By the time you've transferred those BCH to an exchange with 20 transactions, I can't see that price holding
Now if he wants to hodl, he may get a higher value - but still significantly less than $120k
And any losses are still going to end up coming off net, not gross, so are disproportionately large with BTC/BCH mining margins being so thin anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:22:00
$/$/€/etc per transaction is absolutely the correct measurement to use while 99.9% of the community uses fiat as a reference.
Unless crypto overtakes fiat (unlikely with $5/tx fees...) then this will not change.

It will vary a little, but on average you'd expect something in the region ~11-18, compared to ~7 today (based on around 1.6-2.5x as many TX per block)
If you take 14 tx per second on average, you probably won't be far wrong.

Transactions on an exchange don't need confirmations: the exchange already holds both sides of the transaction and can authorize it themselves: they don't move the crypto from your wallet to your trading partner's and vice versa. Confirmations only matter for deposits.

I'm not disagreeing with you; the onus should clearly be on 2X to add replay protection. I'm not even slightly arguing with that, I entirely 100% agree.
Please be clear on what I am saying here: 
2X have said they will not be implementing replay protection. I am not supporting or condoning that, or even commenting on it.
**All** I'm asking is "If THEY won't do so, despite it being their responsibility, what do WE do? Do we ignore it and hope it goes away? Or do we take the unpleasant decision to fulfil their responsibilities because otherwise we're at risk?"
If you consider that to be trolling, I guess we're at an impasse - but I'm not sitting here saying it's the responsibility of the 1X chain - at least, not in terms of "1X should do it rather than 2X"
The simple fact is that if nobody does it, we're likely to run into trouble.

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:15:34


First up, I'm discussing mechanics here, not supporting anyone attacking other chains.
The problem for anyone trying to do this, is that when mining low numbers of blocks (eg just over 6 in 12 hours) you have to account for variance. With low hashrates, variance can be quite dramatic: to near-guarantee enough blocks, you'd have to add a fair chunk of extra hashrate, enough mine at least 7 and probably 8 blocks in a typical hour. And even then, you're likely to eventually hit the EDA by chance, so you can only delay it. 8 blocks in 12 hours is one per 90 minutes, more than enough to run the chain: BCH would still actually have more tx capacity than BTC, albeit with 9-12 hour confirmation times.
And of course, by doing so you make BCH unprofitable to mine: so more of the other miners leave. That's the idea, of course, because you're sabotaging BCH.... but you can't just do this until some miners leave, or the EDA will kick in for the rest. So you have to add hashpower to counteract those leaving. And you have to do so until you control &gt;50% of the BCH hashpower and can "properly" attack the network.
That's a lot of hashpower you have to leave mining at a loss, for quite a long period of time. And until you get &gt;50% of the hashrate, you're basically massively subsidizing BCH.
If you want to spend a few tens of millions of dollars attacking BCH... you probably have better things to do with your time and money.

I was actually referring to wallets, although I missed one step of adding the anti-replay parameters. 16 minutes, perhaps.
For exchanges it's potentially more work, but no different to adding any other coin (and significantly simpler than most). I can understand exchanges saying something like "We will not support it immediately, but *will* support it if xyz criteria are met in 1 month after launch" - that seems reasonable, limiting their initial risk of wasting development time, but supporting their customers.

The fact for me is that Coinbase claimed it was network congestion and blamed the BTC network, despite the fact we could clearly see the transactions weren't being sent to the blockchain.
If they'd come out with this perfectly reasonable explanation initially, I'd have said "Yeah, fair enough"

No, they need to earn it. Both from other people in the country who already have it, and from external sources
"Hey, Starbucks - forget Venezuelan money.... I'll pick your coffee beans for 0.02 BTC a day"
Then when you need to buy something
"Yo, farmer. I'll give you 0.002 for a leg of lamb"
That's how money works: you trade something you have (or your time/skills) for money, then you trade the money for something someone else has (or their time/skills).
You're entirely correct that buying BTC with VEF is hard because nobody wants it... but there's nothing to stop exporters cutting out the middle man entirely. Starbucks wants Venezuelan coffee, and Starbucks is losing out on inflation as much as anyone else: they convert their USD to VEF, but by the time they use it they get fewer coffee beans for their money.
Although all things considered in Venezuela, they'd probably be better off using Monero instead: lower fees, anonymous (less chance of hassle from the government) and they can mine their own if they have PC hardware, especially with cheap power.

On an individual case-by-case basis, sure - there will be outliers.
But if we're talking about a typical fee range of $3-5, that's not unreasonable. Of course there may be very simple TXs at $2.50, or ones with a huge number of micropayment inputs at $8... but if the majority of users are paying $3-5 for the majority of their transactions, it's neither dishonest nor misleading to refer to that range as a typical transaction cost.
We don't need to be precise to discuss the general situation, surely? "Typical fees are $3-5" is a perfectly reasonable point of discussion

Then you walk into their store, you both make a transaction (2x $2 tx fees), you make on LN transaction, then the store commits the result (1x $2x tx fee)
Overall you pay 3x transaction fees to make a single transaction.
LN does lots of useful things if you're a large company who wants to pay suppliers etc in BTC, but I'm yet to see how it makes the "buying coffee" problem any better
Right now, to my knowledge, LN makes no sense for small one-off type transactions. If you buy coffee every day at the same store and the store is happy to take payment once a month, like an enforceable tab, then yeah LN can make sense: but that's about it.

Almost. And it will continue to look like that until one day it doesn't any more
Just because history has repeated of there looks to be a pattern, doesn't mean there is: things chance.
Early investors tend to act in different ways to speculators, who are different to users, who are different to hedge funds etc. As Bitcoin evolves they will interact in ways to change patterns, stop or add patterns, or just make things look like a vague pattern

@_date: 2017-08-20 23:25:26
Not really - a faster block time just means... faster blocks.
The only downsides would be
1. Faster inflation because more block rewards are received in the same space of time, although we'd also hit the block reward "halfening" points faster, so it would at least partially balance out over the long term
2. Faster growth of the blockchain (although if the number of transactions doesn't also increase, this would be minimal). And even here, it's only really a long term problem
If anything it should promote **less** centralization, because the lower difficulty with the same block reward would massively increase profitability and mean older ASICs, those with higher power costs, and even potentially making GPU mining possible again (if the difficulty **really** dropped, but we're talking orders of magnitude for that one)
So while there would be potential downsides, I don't see any reason to be concerned about greater centralization with a lower difficulty. Difficulty really only affects block time: the entire point of it is to balance the global hashrate against the target block time, to make sure blocks don't become too fast or slow

Not at all: price follows value, hashpower follows profitability. The two are loosely linked, but not directly.
The market does not see significant value in Namecoin. The market is clearly still judging the relative merits of BTC and BCH (and is likely to be doing so for some time).
Something significant like hashpower staying with BCH despite being less profitable would naturally have some sway in that judgement: we can see that in the fact that BTC has not dropped significantly in price in proportion to the BTC/BCH hashpower split. The market can see that many miners are sticking with BTC even though it's more profitable to mine BCH, and that increases confidence in BTC. It works both ways, to the benefit or detriment of either coin

Without knowing what his profit margin was, it's impossible to judge beyond that... but I doubt he's running at much more than 5% profit margin on BTC mining. In which case 1/60 of gross would be the equivalent of losing 1/3 of his monthly profit.
And let's be honest, most BTC miners aren't running at 5% profit margins. Either way, it's $120k off his profits. One hell of an expensive joke.

No it doesn't? I'm sorry, but you clearly didn't read my comment
The miners just mine at their regular speed, and the difficulty adjusts over time.
I don't think you understand how mining works - read up on that, then read my comment again and it should make sense. The simple answer, though, is that from this point onward every block will be at 20% lower difficulty (ie 20% faster than the last) until 6 consecutive blocks are produced within a 12 hour period.
No tricks, no weird accounting or 12 hours "turn your miner off" periods - the miners mine, the difficulty drops until blocks are being produced on average every 2 hours (although the end result will be a difficulty that produces blocks of 1h - 1h15, because the last block of the 6 will be faster than 2 hours)

Just because a currency isn't legal tender, doesn't make it illegal. There's no such thing as "illegal tender"

Eg instead of 1 MH for 1000 days, you buy 1000 MH for 1 day.
That means you aren't worried about difficulty changes screwing with your numbers, you aren't worried about global hashrate going up, and you aren't worried about the price changing and leaving you down on your investment.

There's a valid point that 12 days ago, it was harder to tell (at a glance) whether BCash was an attempt at an attack on BCH marketing, or a genuine abbreviation.
Since then it's become far more apparent that anyone using "BCash" without irony can be immediately placed in a "biased fanboy" box and safely ignored.
That means some commentators may have used "BCash" until the latter became obvious, and since then have switched to Bitcoin Cash to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality (or at least, not joining in the political games)

Then Bitcoin would be compromised, and presumably the value would drop to zero while users would fork off their own coin with the non-"stolen" blockchain ledger.
Although in the scenario you mention, someone has &gt;51% of the hashpower of the chain with the most hashpower... by definition, then, they can attack any chain and the experiment is probably dead.
To do so, though, they would have to invest literally billions of dollars and would only really achieve the ability to crash the value of the coins they just stole. If it happens, it's because a nation-state level actor wants to kill Bitcoin.

You can restore your seed on any wallet (hardware or software) that uses the BIP39 and BIP44 specifications for generating a private key and addresses from a seed.

That applies to... basically the entirety of Crypto.
They haven't lost their money, though, so it can't be a scam. Their funds aren't taken by someone else, their funds aren't converted to BCH, and they still have full access to their funds by pressing about 4 buttons

Basically Bitfinex is adding "USDT" to their exchange. The idea of USDT is fairly good: You give Bitfinex 1 USD, and you get 1 USDT in exchange. You can then use the 1 USDT to buy cryptocurrencies, but can move it around between exchanges or wallets like a cryptocurrency.
This is fine as long as USDT is only being created in exchange for 1 USD, and as long as you could, right now, cash every single USDT back out to USD.
The problem is that we aren't actually sure the above are actually true. Bitfinex lost, quite publicly, their USD bank accounts and banking services: and have never actually explained since how they can receive USD, nor hold it. This is certainly suspicious.
They have never released a proper audit proving that they hold USD equivalent to the USDT they have released. They are also producing huge numbers of USDT (tens of millions a week), without these reassurances. Their own terms of service even specifically state that they do **not** back USDT with USD, and that you have no guaranteed right to convert it back to USD
Basically, the concern is that they're buying BTC with fake money that they just invented. Which, obviously, means that a lot of BTC demand ($600 million ish) wasn't real and the real demand is lower. When the demand is lower, that must mean the price is lower, which would mean that the current BTC price is artificially high.
TL;DR: We don't know if Bitfinex actually have 1 USD for each USDT they released, they refuse to prove that they do, and the only evidence we have either way is that they had their banking services removed, which can only be taken as evidence against them until proven otherwise.
I'd be surprised to find Bitfinex had $630m in USD in a bank account. I'd be entirely unsurprised to find they're running something resembling a fractional banking system (the exact type of crap many of us are in Crypto to avoid)

I'm mixed on this
I still consider Bitcoin to be relatively high risk (no regulation, lots of volatility), and therefore advice that it's a risky investment and shouldn't be the majority of your portfolio unless you have a very high tolerance to risk is fairly valid advice
However, the way they tend to entirely shut it down is silly, and inward looking. Personal Finance tends to have a much better stance on Crypto (namely: Don't get greedy, think about your personal goals and balance your risk appropriately) which is far more reasonable

No it doesn't, because you can't measure empty wallets. All BCH wallets already exist, because a wallet is just a key that nobody's found yet.

“Early” is always going to be a moving target based on the current price, and depends on how much you put in and what your goals are, but I’d maybe loosely define it as the point where a sensible investment is now worth 6 or 7 figures.

If you want to pay 10sat/b, then yes you need to complete with all those 10sat/b transactions.
But if you just want to beat them, you don't have to pay 300 sat/b.... you have to pay a whopping 10.1 sat/b. Or about $0.002 more ($0.022 rather than $0.020).
The thing is that while there are lots of low fee Tx sitting doing nothing (because, of course, they're being out-competed for block space), those aren't the ones blocking your 300 sat/b transaction. That's being blocked by thousands of other 300-400 sat/b transactions from other legitimate users.


Yes. Either wait for the backlog to clear, or raise your fee. Normally (/historically) this works, because the "high" fees (to guarantee next block) are still &lt;$1, and $0.20 guarantees the next couple of blocks. But lately, unfortunately, you're looking at more like $5-8 to guarantee the next block or couple of blocks.

Apologies for my friends here taking the piss out of the amount you’re buying
If in doubt, split your purchase into chunks and buy on a regular basis over the time scale your considering
Eg if you’re wondering about a dip at the weekend, split your buy into 4 and buy 1/4 of it for each of the next 4 days. That way you’ll get the average of the price now and the dip, but if you’re wrong and the price goes up you’ll get the average of the price now and the higher price
That said, I’d generally recommend just buying and not worrying about it. You’re either going to be a little high or a little low - but there’s no way to know which now and it’s just a coin toss as to which it ends up being. But you aren’t here for 10% Gains, presumably - so just get it bought

Exchanges will never be the exact same price: they can vary by a few percent due to different demographics being present on each exchange.

I've thought about this one quite a lot, and I really don't think "I can pay taxes with it" gives fiat an intrinsic value.
If we stopped using fiat for literally everything other than paying taxes, how big a desire would you have to accumulate large amounts of fiat?
Not very much, I assume? So the value of fiat drops sharply due to lack of demand. I can see the logic of "But people will always want *some* to pay their taxes, so there's a minimum value" - and it does carry some merit. But so does the argument that governments would realize they're losing out by insisting on receiving taxes in an unused currency, and would instead start demanding we pay our taxes with Bitcoin.
And add in the fact that the government has to actually spend that fiat on services, wages etc. If the fiat value drops sharply, because nobody wants it, the government is going to struggle to recruit people and buy services. In order to do so, they'd have to print more, devaluing it further... or just start taxing and paying people in fiat.
While I do agree that government taxes and spending are a major part of our uses of currency, I don't think they're an impenetrable barrier to fiat ever being destroyed. Look at the times major currencies have been replaced (Deutschmark-&gt;Reichmark), for example: being able to pay taxes in the old currency didn't stop the value plummeting when outside market forces dictated it.
Now to be clear, I'm not a crypto-anarchist who thinks fiat will be dead in 3 years: just that I disagree taxes/government wages give fiat an intrinsic value. They certainly give it a certain resilience of value, but that's not quite the same thing

Exchanges, like banks, only end up having "premium prices" as you phrase it, once people are questioning how solvent they are. When there's a "run on the bank" so to speak.

2. The price is going up: when people are buying, few people are cashing out to USD anyway
3. When people "cash out" on Bitfinex, they don't get USD in their bank... they get USDT in their exchange. Traders and people who are "buying the dip" won't ask for the USD, so their "cashing out" doesn't actually matter to Bitfinex even if the latter is not solvent
The real question is what happens if/when there is a "run on the bank" (lots of people withdrawing to *real* fiat, not to USDT) on Bitfinex: if they're solvent it will be fine. If they aren't, it'll be Mt Gox all over again, when people realize they can't actually pay everyone who supposedly has assets on the exchange.

It would absolutely affect the price.
However, nobody with 30,000 BTC is going to be stupid enough to sell 30k BTC at $8k in one go. All you would do by doing so would be to sell the first few hundred at current market rate, and then for each additional coin you sold, you would get less and less money because you are pushing the value down by selling more than the market demand can handle. And that's assuming you don't cause a panic and a crash by selling 1/4 of a billion worth of BTC.
Anyone with any sense would sell chunks of 100 coins at regular intervals to avoid panicking the market into thinking a major event is going on.

Apart from a significant proportion of the attacks on people like Jihan and Roger are not factual, are not substantiated, or are just blatant personal attacks
I’ve never objected to someone stating a clear reason to believe the above are acting in their own interests (although I think the concept that anyone here is acting for anything else is naive at best, we’re all here for ourselves). or reasonably discussing their actions
But when we’ve got “Roger sold explosives from a residential building!!” Without any context at all, or relevance to Crypto, that’s a witch hunt rather than an attempt to present an argument about Bitcoin. And before we get into the argument I’m sure my previous sentence will probably provoke, it’s just the first example that comes to mind

I don't work for them, I just understand how T&amp;Cs work.
The link you quote is a blog post/guide, not T&amp;Cs. Where they differ, terms and conditions override a blog post. You agree to the terms and conditions when making a transaction, you do not agree to the blog post. The blog post is not a legally binding document, the terms are.
Even if we do refer to the blog post


That's ambiguous, it doesn't specify whether the "sent" is "into the mempool" or "on the blockchain" - legally speaking there's no definition, so we need to find one. Where else can we find a definition? Well, in the legally binding terms and conditions
But if it ever came to contesting ShapeShift's actions or bringing a claim against them, that blog post means nothing: The terms and conditions are the legal basis for the transaction. If you don't agree with them, don't use the service. It's that simple.

It does, the graphic is from cash.coin.dance and includes the whole block reward (coin base plus fees) into account, along with difficulty, to estimate the profitability.
It will never be 100% accurate because it can only use recent fees in that estimate, but it will almost always be something close to the true figure
Note that I believe coin.dance uses a recent typical fee, and fork.lol uses the last block - this means fork.lol is a little more sensitive to variance in block times.

He sold firecrackers without a licence
“Sold explosives” while technically correct, is clearly intended to make his offence much more sensational sounding and invoke prejudices.
If that pictures said “sold firecrackers on eBay without a license”, suddenly it takes on a very different slant, and much lower and less viscous levels of condemnation than the “sold explosives” phrasing which is clearly intended to make Roger sound like a very dangerous and violent criminal.
It’s classic political “technically correct, but clearly bullshit once explained”. You’re trying to make him sound like a terrorist, he sold fireworks.

Yes. That reason is that car steering was originally mechanically linked, and more recently usually hydraulically linked. As such, you needed a certain amount of strength to turn the wheel at all times (mechanical steering) or if the hydraulic pump failed (hydraulic steering), and the wheel provides that leverage. Also because of the nature of the steering, you need ~3 turn lock to lock, which is impractical without a wheel.
In modern cars, though, it's often electronically linked: either fully or partially. If the steering is not mechanical or hydraulic, but fully electric, you don't need a wheel at all - you can use this type of wheel, or even something like a joystick if you wanted to: although the latter would be a little counter-intuitive.

In the U.K, unless you dispose of &gt;£44k (approx) per annum, or profit &gt;£11,000 (again approx) per annum, you do not need to report any gains whatsoever to HMRC. This is very clearly, explicitly stated on the Capital Gains Tax information on the HMRC website. The Cryptocurrency memo also clarifies how cryptocurrency works under the UK tax system (short answer: mining and day trading as your day job come under Income Tax, anything else is under CGT)
I can’t comment on how things work in the US, and perhaps there are people who are avoiding declaring their own income and chargeable events - but regardless you stated that Bitcoin transactions were illegal. This is entirely untrue, the transactions are legal. Avoiding declaring them if you are obliged to is indeed illegal, but that’s a tax issue not a Bitcoin issue, and is no different to the fact that being paid in cash is legal even though some people avoid taxes by doing so.

Part of the issue is that as soon as one exchange goes down, the traffic flocks to the other exchanges which are already heavily loaded.
So even if all exchanges but one build in 30% extra capacity, they can be overwhelmed even if their own organic traffic increases by 15-20%, just because of an influx from other exchanges.

Pretty much. Then they trade that USDT for people's actual real Bitcoin.
Those people think they can trade the USDT for USD at any time and withdraw it to their bank account... but there's no evidence that Tether actually own any USD at all, never mind the ~600 million they would need to back USDT 1:$1
Which is all beside the point, because Tether don't even actually promise to trade USDT for USD anyway. In fact, their terms of service specifically state they don't guarantee that.
So basically Bitfinex created 600 million tokens, told everyone they have $600m in the bank, and started offering people a swap of their tokens for Bitcoin (without actually promising to give $1 for each USDT). Some people are apparently stupid enough to accept this trade: either because they believe Bitfinex has the USD (despite absolutely no evidence that that's the case), or because they simply don't realize USDT and USD are different things.

It's more the plausible deniability: if all your Monero transactions are anonymous, there's no need to explain any of them. If you only make a few anonymous BTC transactions, though, they're conspicuous.
I'm generally of the opinion that a privacy based crypto which is always private, is better (speaking purely in terms of privacy) than one which is opt-in
Bitcoin also has the question of whether things like Lightning Network support anonymity/private transactions. If they don't, then you'd be looking at relatively high fees on the main chain (because the idea of BTC at that stage would be to use 2nd layer solutions for cheaper transactions, and on-chain transactions would be expensive by comparison)

The fact is that they’re quite generous by offering fixed-price orders at all - use any other exchange and you’d have to wait for 1-6 confirmations before you can trade it at whatever price was available at that time.
ShapeShift allow you to lock in the price a block early, try that anywhere else and see how it works out 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:15:04
For what reason?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:44:55
Sure, although I suspect I'll always prefer Monero or another "always private" cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is likely to only ever have opt-in privacy, which by definition reduces the amount of privacy. This is fine, and certainly not a complaint from me: I can completely see the logic of retaining backward compatibility and keeping fees low (more privacy generally requires larger transactions, for example)... but it means I don't think I'll ever be 100% BTC when I want privacy later.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:42:14
No they didn't. BTC is still the default as has always been the case.
Previously you had to manually create an additional BCH wallet if you wanted one. Now it is created automatically as a second wallet on the app.
For most people with a BTC wallet who also use/hold BCH (or just anyone who had BTC before August 1st), this is actually very convenient.

Also covered in their terms:

No, but equally governments do not accept other fiat currencies for paying tax either. That's the nice thing about currencies: you can exchange them

It's more the fact that we're all aware that the total amount of Tether is something like 0.5% of BTC's total Market Cap, and nearly 30% of all BTC trading is done in BTC/USDT.
So *if* USDT is dodgy, and therefore that demand is mostly fake, somewhere between 0.5% and 30% of demand is fake... but markets don't work like that, they work on confidence. If suddenly a lot of people lose confidence, the price plummets by more than you'd expect: Look at the China panic: the price dropped by significantly more than the % of trade done in China.

Because that’s literally the entire point of “trustless peer-to-peer cash”. It’s the point of Bitcoin.
All transactions are on the blockchain, nobody has to trust anyone else.
If you want to trust someone else to run your currencies, I’m sure PayPal and VISA will be delighted to receive your patronage.
But again, I wasn’t discussing scaling here - I was discussing the way the OP is claiming to “Call out BS” while being dishonest himself in his claim that fees are low.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:55:28
It was always possible for it to happen: just not necessarily via SegWit - there are many other ways to solve transaction malleability (the barrier to LN previously). It's not that BCH supporters, for example, were opposed to that - BCH actually added changes during the fork to fix quadratic hashing.
The idea that someone who truly believed in the concept of 2nd layer solutions would just halt development until SegWit was activated seems strange: if they believed in it and lost the debate, surely they'd be the one forking off when the time came, to follow their own ambition.
Both groups believe the other will eventually fail, so should keep their own vision alive ready to take over when the other falls. Stopping development for a year doesn't tally with that

The node being used by the website showing the mempool stats was probably restarted. When it restarted, the mempool empties. It will receive current recent mempool transactions from its peers, but that tends to only be the newer transactions - not ones already dropped by the peers.
The stats node will likely have a long timeout on mempool transactions to keep the data accurate, but other nodes will drop transactions faster to save memory. How long you keep transactions is a choice for each node

It's not faulty wallets, it's wallets acting normally but the situation being unusual.
They're choosing a fee (200-300 sat/b) that is perhaps 30% below the current block average. Under normal circumstances, that's a good way to get a relatively cheap (compared to current averages) economy transaction into a block in the next hour or two.
When things are flowing normally, that works fine. At the moment, though, the fees are staying so high that those economy transactions just still aren't getting through, because there are so many non-economy transactions going in ahead.
It's wallets acting normally in an abnormal situation

Only on lite nodes. Full nodes it makes no difference.


I still don't understand the vehemence against hard forks. Done properly, like ETH does, they aren't even slightly an issue.


So does BIP140, and BIP140 does it for every transaction, rather than just those who choose to use it. SegWit doesn't (and cannot without a hard fork) enforce non-malleable transaction IDs.


Mostly (entirely?) through the removal of Tx Malleability
To be clear, though, I'm not actually opposed to SegWit: I think it's a clever way to allow lite nodes not to store as much data, and provides an option to have "very lite" (pruned history + pruned SegWit) nodes which is nice. It does provide one solution to Tx Malleability: albeit not a complete one, and it allows more transactions without a hard fork.
But to truly "solve" transaction malleability you need a hard fork anyway, at which point "provides some scaling without a hard fork" doesn't carry as much weight anyway. So at best it's a partial solution. It's a very good, clever partial solution... but we still need the rest of the solution.
SegWit is great if the second layer solutions truly solve the scaling problem, reliably, without centralization (ie no "supernodes" that act like a mini PayPal), and if they mean that users retain control of their coins without having to lock them away with third parties. We won't actually know if 2nd layer achieves those things until we see them in the real world though: at least several months away, and likely years for all use cases to be covered, since they can't all be covered by a single 2nd layer paradigm (1-many, many-1, 1-1, many-many, and then all those variants with single transactions and multiple transactions)
I truly want 2nd layer to succeed, but it's not going to happen overnight. Equally I truly think SegWit is a positive and clever addition to Bitcoin, but it's not going to solve every problem.
That's why I genuinely supported SegWit2X. Both parts of it: SegWit for the benefits it adds now, and the potential for others later. And 2X for immediate short term scaling without being on a "slippery slope" to 1GB blocks, just to tide us over until 2nd layer can come online. I would have also added BIP140 to this list, to solve transaction malleability entirely.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:29
I think they’re good ideas although I’m not sure how well they’ll solve all use cases for the scaling problems we’re currently having.
I continue to hope they’ll work well, I’m just a little wary of the way they’re being touted by some as a perfect, flawless solution when they’ve never been real world tested

@_date: 2017-11-14 14:22:01
I think it's more the fact that people are focusing on "how full the mempool is" - which is basically irrelevant.
The only factor that matters is the fee
- How much does it cost to get into the next block?
- How much does it cost to get into one of the next few blocks?
Those things are not affected by spam-dust transactions
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:39:41
No they don't: they create one wallet. Previously BTC, now BCH.
You can then, yourself, create the other by importing the keys from the other. This is easy, but you have to manually do it.
I'd like to see the app create both wallets from the first seed you generate, so you start with both a BTC and a BCH wallet
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:19:12

2. Nobody makes a fuss over things being as they should be
3. It's over a week later
4. You don't have to be a "hater" to be pissed off at spending $7 per transaction
Why would we talk about things being as they should be, a week after the problem?
But please, stop trying to place anyone who complained about high fees, at a time where fees **were** high, as a "hater" or some kind of concern troll or enemy of Bitcoin. It's a legitimate problem, and people had legitimate complaints about it.

I think the concept of 2nd Layer is excellent.
I think the reality is likely to be very, very difficult and throw up problems nobody was expecting. Routing is one hell of a tricky problem, and the difference between "decentralized" and "distributed" is an important one (I know this is central to a BCH meme picture, but it's also a valid point of discussion).
I think the idea is good, I suspect the practicalities are going to mean they do not fulfill as many use cases as they are currently being put forward for: 2nd Layer protocols are not a magic pill, they are part of a solution.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:58:49
You use emotive language like "terrified" to try to belittle the discussion.

My issue with the whole "But fees are low again" thing is that this is now the 4th or 5th time in my (fairly brief) involvement in Crypto that fees and confirmation times have rocketed for a few days, making it almost unusable.
Yes, fees are low now - at a time of low demand - but a payment network has to be able to handle the times of high demand, not the times of low demand. VISA scales to handle Saturday afternoon week before Christmas, not a random Tuesday morning in March. Similarly Bitcoin needs to scale for the busiest times, not the quietest.
I suspect that neither a 1MB block, 8/32MB block, nor 2nd layer solutions, are the full answer. Personally I'd like to see some kind of smarter block size, which takes into account the size of the mempool (in terms of no of tx, size in MB, total fees, median fee etc), such that a bigger block isn't just empty space to be filled for free but instead is a way of keeping fees and confirmations consistent.

I think that very much depends on your circumstances.
For someone in their 50s with most of their life goals achieved and a $1m investment portfolio, a percent or so into Crypto was (and probably is) a safe, but interesting bet.
I'm not quite so sure that it works as blanket advice, though. For many of the younger generations, crypto may be more of a dice roll on having the opportunity to, for example, own their own home. If they put in 1%, they're not going to make enough to care. If they put in 50%, they might.

It's a domino effect: one big exchange goes down, so the traffic flocks to the other exchanges which are, themselves, under heavy load.
When they're already dealing with a heavy load and then suddenly have to deal with a load of traffic from another large exchange that just went down, that's when they have problems. And then once the second goes down, the same happens again but even worse

SegWit adoption alone isn't even close to enough. We're currently at a point with today's user levels where we can hit capacity bottlenecks for a few days. That's with 1.05MB equivalent blocks. The realistic maximum for SegWit is about 1.7MB equivalent.
We have, at most, 70% "peak" capacity available if literally everyone uses SegWit. That's not a lot if the number of users increases by an order of magnitude

Even the largest miners would only get back a proportion of their own fees. That’s still a lot of money to donate to your competitors
And if you mine your own spam transactions, you’re actually losing more money than if you just mined the higher fee transactions above it.
I’m not saying spam has no effect - but go actually look at the mempool and the fees waiting in it, there’s a lot of normal, high fee transactions sitting there.
The idea that this is all spam is nonsense. There’s definitely some spam, there’s also definitely an impact from the hashrate bouncing all over the place with BCH lately. But there are also thousands upon thousands of legitimate transactions paying high fees and still not getting into a block
Go look at daily volumes over the weekend - crazy high amounts of BTC were being traded, exchanged, and transferred. This wasn't someone making 100,000x $1 transactions: this was tens of billions worth of BTC being traded and transferred.

If this is a crash, I’m pretty okay with it
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:28:58
Not really, their update is basically just a faster version of the current difficulty adjustment, with a couple of extra bits to ensure it doesn’t over-compensate and start to fluctuate like the current EDA they have. It doesn’t affect block sizes or change on chain capacity based on demand, if anything it does the opposite and makes the available transaction throughput much more consistent

But if another miner (which does have a timeout) has dropped the low fee transaction and therefore is happy to mine the higher fee transaction, that will get onto the blockchain.

I'm not talking about earnings in Bitcoin, or capital gains from Bitcoin you hold. I'm talking (as I thought you were) about the concept of "Fiat will never be worthless, because the fact governments accept it to pay taxes means it will always have value"
You repeat that in your comment, and that's exactly the part I'm disagreeing with: there is nothing to say that governments would always insist on fiat, they can change to accepting anything they like
Remember that the government has to spend their fiat too: if nobody wants it, the government will start looking for other currencies to use, just like everyone else.

The BTC would arrive. The recipient just can't see it with their misconfigured app: the recipient would have no grounds to say that the funds didn't arrive if they asked for BTC at an address and you sent BTC.
The problem is simply that it's potentially confusing for new users, but there's no legal issue here.
Besides which, if you got a BCH wallet and then started trying to send BTC with it, you'd notice at the point you tried to send BTC to your own wallet ready to use, not when you tried to send it from that wallet to a business.
Eg you create a BCH wallet by mistake, you load it up from your Trezor/Ledger... the funds don't arrive from your Hardware wallet, and you import the keys as a BCH wallet. Job done. You'd never get to the stage of accidentally sending BTC to someone else and accidentally sending BCH, because you'd never be able to load your BCH wallet up with BTC in the first place.
Although I do entirely agree that Bitcoin.com should create *both* wallets when you first create a wallet. I've run into this exact issue myself and it would have saved a bit of effort

I have multiple use cases for Crypto. One of those is a speculative investment based on media attention and my prediction that a store of value cryptocurrency will be used and most likely be Bitcoin
To that end, I hold BTC. I also think Crypto will have uses as an anonymous currency, and as “peer to peer cash” as was the original point of it.
I’d prefer if one Crypto could cover all these cases (and others beside) because it would be convenient and valuable and easier to “sell” to the public and financial institutions.
Bitcoin still suits some of my needs, but we’d all likely do much better from our investments if BTC could scale properly and quickly.
I also hold BCH, ETH, and XMR because they fit well with other things (cash, smart money, privacy) that I feel work well with cryptocurrencies.
The world isn’t binary, nor is support for a crypto currency. I can still have a use for Bitcoin while wishing it was better.

We are. And they're refusing to provide any evidence.
I'm drawing my conclusion from that. My conclusion is that they may be "solvent" but do not have $1 for each USDT they release.

You don’t necessarily have to declare every transaction, or even most.
If I send funds between my wallets or to an exchange, I don’t have to declare that because I haven’t disposed of my Bitcoin.
And even if I trade my BTC, I don’t automatically have to declare the trade. For example here in the U.K. If I trade less than £44k/year, and make less than £11k profit/year (only including the amount I dispose of in that year), I don’t have to declare it.

The two chains forked from the same codebase (and block chain), and use the same address/private key format (or at least, the default addresses: SegWit adds a new address format, and these addresses will not work in BCH
If you generate a BCH private key and address, you also, by definition, create the same private key and address on the BTC chain. And vice versa.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:59:56
This was at the point of the fork happening, but before the DAA had actually changed the difficulty. It has now done so and the current difference is that BTC is currently 3.7% more profitable to mine
Expect this to continue to vary for a few days as miners settle into the new relationship between the chains and difficulty algorithms, but it should stay somewhere between +/-5% most of the time.
Edit: now 4.5%, it appear AntPool have moved a fairly large amount of hashpower to BCH. As above, expect this kind of variation, but we shouldn’t see the +150%, -40% etc kind of nonsense we’ve been seeing in the last couple of months, nor times where average block times hit 30-80 minutes etc for a day at a time

Yeah, real men like to drive slower
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:33:28

Unless miners are idiot, the price, hashpower, block reward, and difficulty will stay roughly in proportion for each chain. 
Even if just a small number of miners move back and forth to the most profitable chain, the hashpower and price will remain approximately constant in their ratio (that ratio being the difficulty)

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:57:19
You jumped the gun, it was widely known that it would take a short time to adjust: but now the two chains should stay within 5% of each other (and usually &lt;2-3%) assuming sufficient numbers of miners move between the chains for profit, which will balance the chains similar to exchange arbitration.
Currently it’s ~3% more profitable to mine BTC, but expect this to vary over the next day or two as miners settle after the upheaval of the last couple of days. Once settled it shouldn’t ever go beyond about 5% in favour of either chain for more than a couple of hours.
It’s actually done a very good job so far of damping the initial swing and the oscillations since, which is a positive thing for everyone. Ideological miners can now mine their preferred chain without losing out on huge amounts of money, and profit-driven miners can switch for a little more money but not crazy amounts, in exchange for a little more work, and keep the chains in balance
Roughly speaking, the hashrate should slowly settle in a similar ratio to price (eg at the current BCH/BTC price of 0.2, we’d expect roughly 1 BCH miner for every 5 BTC miners). Although it’s actually likely to end up slightly more heavily weighted towards BTC because the block rewards aren’t directly proportional, it should roughly resemble the price ratio as long as enough miners are profit-driven 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:26:23
Long term, good. Very good - the two chains will mostly stabilize and we won't see these huge swings where either chain drops from 10 minute block times to 2 hours.
Short term, still good: we're still going to see some fluctuations for a while as the miners and hashrates settle, but where the previous corrections took weeks, these will now take a day or two at most, and correct much more gently.
It's not going to be perfect, but after a couple of days of volatility it should be good

Mars roundtrip communication is already ~25 minutes away, anything beyond that significantly more so (in the order of 10 hours round trip to Pluto)
Anything further than the moon is basically unfeasible if network latency is an issue.
That said, it depends whether you need to mine on other planets: mining is far more vulnerable to latency than transactions are.
Realistically, assuming we didn't have something resembling quantum-entanglement based communication (but that actually worked) we'd probably want a cash type currency on each planet, with a much (much) slower ledger for store of wealth.
Which is to say, you'd use something like MarsCoin, EarthCoin, PlutoCoin on each planet, either with variable or fixed exchange rates, and then keep a much slower centralized ledger of transactions between them. You'd be limited to moving funds in and out of the centralized ledger at a rate of ~1 hr-10hr transactions (depending if we're talking about scaling to Mars or to Pluto), but that's not too big of a deal: you just keep enough "cash" on hand.
And it's not like you'll be travelling back and forth any faster than the speed of light, so as long as nobody runs out of money there's little in the way of practical problems

# Dear everyone complaining that they were stuck in LA traffic at 5pm yesterday: Los Angeles traffic is fine, I drove around at 2am and there was almost no traffic. Stop the BS
I love how you post a week **after** the worst of the backlog with "Stop the BS". If you'd sent this transaction a week ago, you'd have been waiting literally days for your transaction to confirm.
Commenting like this a week after the worst of the backlog is more BS than anyone claiming they couldn't get transactions through with 250 sat/byte last Saturday. You're being deliberately disingenuous, they were stating a fact.
Also, when you blank out the time received it just looks like you're trying to hide that the transaction sat in the mempool for 10 hours. [That doesn't appear to be the case, however]( so I'm not sure why you'd hide it....
Unless, I suppose, you don't want us to see that **the effective fee was 44%** and you spent $0.88 on fees to send $1.99. Because I guess that takes away a lot of the force of your argument when you're saying fees are low and other people are BS'ing.
So yeah, you managed to send $1.99, paying "only" $0.88 (44%) in fees, a week after the worst of the transaction backlog... and those complaining about high fees are the ones BS'ing? Makes perfect sense. In fact, if you'd sent that transaction last Saturday, you'd have paid 3x as much on fees as you were trying to send, and waited at least 27 hours unless very lucky

Sure,  but an important thing to remember (and one often overlooked) is that people have very different tolerances on what they're "okay with losing"
For example I have a very manageable mortgage, secure job, and defined benefit pension - I could essentially afford to lose everything but this month's bills and the emergency fund I keep in case the roof leaks.
If you live at home with your parents at 14, you could afford to lose even more (percentage wise) of your savings than me. If you're a contractor who's expecting a new baby next month and are about to buy a new home, you probably can't afford to lose anything.
As long as we keep in mind that what everyone can afford to lose will vary wildly, it's good advice: but too many people jump down the throat of someone else taking a risk they themselves wouldn't tolerate, ignoring the fact that the person they're speaking to may be fine with it.

Well it's true, but equally it's worth noting that there's a minimum fee at any given time (albeit one that varies over time) even for non-urgent transactions.
But yeah, I think it's best explained to newbies as being a "per transaction" fee, where you have a minimum to actually get the transaction through the system, and then can add to it for a faster transaction.
This makes more logical sense than the one sometimes put forward of "If it's less urgent, pay less", because the fees don't usually scale to zero - the mempool has only been &lt;1MB once this month, and close once. There's rather a fluctuating minimum recommended fee for inclusion in a sensible number of blocks, and then you can increase that for urgent transactions
But yeah, the "It's per transaction" is the first step to understanding. Then understanding how the number of input/output addresses is the next: the only analogy that I've found works is if you explain it like cash, and the fee is "per coin/note". Eg if you pay for $10 worth of stuff with a $10 bill, the fee is lower. If you pay with 10x $1 bills, it's higher. This is counter-intuitive to most people used to dealing with cash or credit cards, so explaining the way it's "You're paying for space in the block, and your transaction has to include where the money comes from (the coins from our analogy) to be valid" is usually the last step, I've found most people "get" it after that

Only slightly - it doesn’t matter if you add 100k or 100 million $0.01 fees, that still only pushes the fee to $0.02
Bitcoin isn’t a first in first out queue, higher priced transactions are taken first, and only those lower than the top ~2000 are ignored
You could add 1, 1000, or 1 billion $0.01 fee transactions, but that wouldn’t change anything for the transaction above that. Transactions of $0.02 would still get into the next block. The same applies even if the spam is $1/Tx - that only pushes the fee to $1.01
So unless these “spam” transactions are paying fees of $5 or $10 each (or whatever it takes to get in the next block currently) then they make no difference - they just sit in the blockpool and get ignored
The problem is that there are currently more than 2000 legitimate, fee paying transactions trying to get into the block. That’s a scaling problem, not a spam one.
The spam is a problem too, but not the cause of $20 transaction fees.

While I can see the ideology here, the practicality is that the base Model S/X are already very fast cars: you're only really unlocking a modest amount of extra power well beyond anything useable day to day.
Once you get below a 6 second 0-60mph, you're more than fast enough to not actually need more power: beyond that it's just there for fun. In fact, I'd argue that an 8 second 0-60mph is sufficient to never feel like you need your car to be a little faster to get you out of trouble when you make a mistake.... but that's irrelevant when the Model 3 and Model X do it in 6 seconds, and the Model S and Roadster are much faster.

I don’t see how they can be expected to do anything else - they can’t control Bitcoin’s DAA, and the one they’ve chosen also indirectly benefits BTC by avoiding the swings we’ve seen lately. That’s about the best they could do in the situation.
But a slow move over wouldn’t hurt BTC as much, anyway. If they wanted to hurt BTC they could move all their hashpower immediately and leave BTC with very slow blocks for weeks until the next difficulty adjustment kicks in. BCH would be back to normal within hours, BCH would take weeks or even months depending on the hashpower moved
The best thing that can happen for BTC is that miners either stay with BTC or, if they are going to move, they move slowly. BCH can now handle short, sharp shocks to hashpower, BTC still cannot
Basically, though, this change means that BCH’s EDA stops negatively affecting both coins. Miners can now move wherever they want, based on ideology or profit (their choice) without throwing everything into chaos. I see that as a very good thing.

1. There's no evidence yet as to which chain is the "minority" chain. And, in fact, it varies depending on the metric you use. Miners? S2X wins. Value? According to futures, BTC wins. Users? There's no clear evidence either way, other than futures but they reflect the money of risk takers, not necessarily sentiments of users.
2. Nobody "thinks they will lose", and even if they do they aren't going to announce it to the world and guarantee that they lose by showing a lack of faith in their own vision
3. Even if we knew ahead of time what the result was, why should only the smaller, losing chain care about it's users?

Yes, OP
A mempool full of very low fee transactions isn’t a problem, they’ll just be ignored. This kind of spam is only an issue in that it fills up the block (**after** real transactions) and therefore takes up space on node HDDs. At most it affects fees a very small amount
The problem is that real transactions are not getting through for hours. Real transactions from real people with real, non-dust fees.
When the “spam” is worth half a million dollars worth of fees, it probably isn’t spam...

It doesn't "prove" anything either way
But the "omfg 60%" attitude is nonsense - of course the backlog is mostly made up of low fee transactions: they won't be processed during a peak time. That's not unusual, it's expected, so of course they build up.
If you're in line to get in a bar, and people keep coming along and paying the bouncer to get on the guest list, you're going to stay in the queue a long time with the other people who don't want to pay for guest list.

Because SegWit was added afterward and the ledger will create a different set of addresses and keys if you chose the SegWit option
For you, making your first wallet, that’s fine. You can choose SegWit and never use the non-SegWit option
For anyone who already has funds in the nonSW wallet, though, they still need their Ledger to be capable of generating the non-SegWit keys so they can access their nonSW wallet.
The Ledger software allows you to choose, but it’s mostly for backward compatibility

1. Not an attack on SegWit, nor a discussion of scaling. I was purely talking about address malleability. BIP 140 does solve that better (or rather, much more simply) than SegWit. BIP140 is not about scaling, and not was that part of that discussion.
2. A discussion of the semantics of “how does the world know which side of an arbitrary fork is Bitcoin and which is the altcoin, if not proof of work?” I’ve also agreed many times that proof of work (longest cumulative proof of work chain) no longer works for measuring community census. Either way, that comment was nothing to do with SegWit, it was a general discussion of how to measure consensus.
3. Not anti-SegWit, simply stating that increasing the block size is, from a code point of view, very simple, when people were asking why there wasn’t more development going on in the S2X branch. I was discussing the 2X part (neutrally), with no reference at all to SegWit.
So you’ve cited three examples of how I’m anti-SegWit for scaling where I don’t actually say anything negative about SegWit for scaling.

Legal tender can't force anyone to use anything other than the fact it can force people to pay government debts in fiat, as discussed already, and the fact that it can force you to accept fiat as payment for other debts.
So yeah, the government and individuals could, if they really wanted to, enforce a certain minimum usage of fiat by standing by the "legal tender" use of fiat. But they'd be completely shooting themselves in the foot to do so. And the definition of legal tender can be changed with a single piece of legislation: it only takes one administration to realize how much they're losing out and add Bitcoin to the list of legal tender to take that away.
I do agree that the government has an incentive to maintain fiat. I also tend to agree with you that having government involvement in currencies can be a good thing: my objection to fiat isn't actually the government, it's the banks. I mostly trust my government: not so much with policy, but with regulation (being European helps, our governments are often more sensible).
I don't really think fiat is going to go away, if I'm honest, I just disagree that it has "intrinsic" value. It has value resilience, sure.

90% would be a block about every 90 minutes, not every hour. And it would take 3-6 months or more to recover.
And that assumes the remaining 10% hang around in the inevitable price drop if that kind of hashpower drain happens.
I'm not saying this will happen, and it's certainly looking less likely now that some of the major pools have backed out of S2X: but it's possible and it's a major potential risk if it does happen
As for second guessing the relative value of S2X if it survives... neither of us have any real idea about that

Investing $10 is almost certainly a waste of time
The current price is about $3800. A realistic but high estimate of the medium term price would be perhaps $100k
That would give an increase of something like 20x - for around $200 return on your $10, which doesn’t feel like it’s worth the effort 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:04:56


The important thing here is to ask *why* you think you should invest.
Look medium-long term: look 3-10 years out and ask yourself what you reasonably think Bitcoin and Crypto can achieve, and what you think that would be worth to people.
Forget the short term ups and downs, forget the "omfg $1m soon!" shills (it's possible, but unlikely) and think instead about what you actually want to risk and what you think is reasonable.
If you're here for $20k next month, or $1m in 10 years, you're probably looking at things wrong. If you're here for something in the range of $10-100k in 3-10 years time, you're probably being reasonable 
More importantly, be here because you believe in some of what Bitcoin is trying to achieve, not because you think it can make you some money.
And most importantly of all, be aware that this is still a risk and you could lose your money. The longer things go on, the less likely a crash to zero becomes - but it's always possible if something extreme happens to really destroy confidence.

Japan's economic problems result in deflation, they aren't necessarily caused by deflation.
A massively ageing population is a huge part of their issue - old people are savers, young people are spenders. A large retraction in manufacturing, without being replaced with enough serviced based industry, is another: Japan went from being a major exporter to a hefty importer in a matter of years. That kind of change will shock any economy.
It's also a result of daft government policy. The Japanese government's spending is actually dropping too: they're acting like savers, not spenders. The best and fastest way for the Japanese government to get rid of this deflationary tendency would be for them to start investing heavily: which is to say, spending money, paying wages, inflating wages etc. Combine that with increased taxes on savings and property, and people will have more incentive to spend their money, while the government itself causes inflation.
The important thing here is that Japan's deflationary death spiral is not the result of a deflationary currency (their currency is inflationary, just like the rest of the world): it's the result of other factors. Their currency is just as inflationary as USD/GBP/EUR/CNY, the currency has nothing to do with it.

You'll note that I said "When their own holding hits $1m" - eg if I have 20 BTC I'll cash out at $50k. If you have 10 BTC you'll cash out at $100k. I'm not talking particularly about 1 BTC = $1mill
You may also note that when I did mention it, I said "If we ever hit some huge number like $1mill"
This is absolutely not a price prediction - if anything I'm using the "$1m would be crazy high" point to show that even though that kind of level would cause anyone still invested from now to cash out, it's probably not going to matter if we ever got there.
The point being that most people do not hold exactly 1 BTC, so even if we hit the rather infeasible $1m/BTC point we aren't going to see everyone cash out at the same time

That car analogy pretty much nails it, yeah. I don't mind the government being involved with some regulation, I just don't want the government in control.
I'm not an anarchist, I don't want the government to disappear - I just want the government to be slightly more detached from direct decision making about the economy, and to police it instead.
Kinda like economic/currency secularism, I guess, if that was a thing?
I can see why people want a completely government-less currency, and I guess there are reasons to want that: similar to internet privacy/encryption etc... but I don't want it to be the default.
eg I wouldn't mind if something like Monero exists as a wild west where money can't be traced, but I like that Bitcoin has some oversight.
That might be against the general feelings of the sub, and I'm certainly not suggesting it as policy - it's just my own opinion on how I'd like to see regulation applied. At the end of the day, regulation is rather inevitable: it's just a question of how much we'll see and how it will manifest

The simplest solution is to split your funds
1. Make two new wallets
2. Send all your funds via a tx on the S1X chain to one wallet,
3. Then send all your funds via the S2X chain to the second wallet
Your funds are now separated, because they are held by different private keys and therefore a transaction from either wallet cannot be replayed on the other chain (because that wallet on the other chain contains no coins)

The risk for BTC is that the S2X takes &gt;90% of the hashpower immediately. If it does, BTC will suddenly have no blocks and will struggle to recover. In that situation, either the money floods to S2X, other alts, or out to fiat

Think back to when you bought at that point. What was your reason?
Has that reason changed?
Sure, you could have bought in now for less, but the fundamental reason you thought BTC was valuable has presumably not changed, unless that reason was "Heck, this thing is real popular in China"
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:35:08
There are a whole bunch of things to look at here
One is that the two sides of the fork now have an equivelent of ~10x as much space as before.
Another is that BCH is not "Bitcoin with 8MB block" - they don't just inherit all Bitcoin accepting merchants etc, so therefore they've taken several steps backward in adoption: comparing BCH now to BTC in July is disingenuous for that reason alone.
And we probably shouldn't forget that BTC merchant adoption itself has dropped, possibly (/probably) due to higher fees and network congestion.
I really don't think it's as simple as "The blocks aren't full, therefore BCH supporters were wrong"
This thread would have a possible valid point if BCH blocks were hovering at around 1MB, which would look a little silly considering their argument was "1MB isn't enough". Equally, though, this is a **scaling** debate. The entire point is that it's about scaling for the future.
The "It needs to be now" aspect is not "The space is needed immediately" but rather "The change needs to be made now before it's too late and we kill the whole project because people get frustrated and ditch it"
This whole thread is ridiculous: the scaling debate was not "*do we scale?*" it was "***how*** *do we scale?*". People disagreed on the approach, not the concept. Taking this back to some kind of alternate reality where Bitcoin doesn't need to scale is just blindly attacking the other side of that debate, with no pretense at even having the vaguest clue what you're talking about. Bitcoin has to scale to succeed. I don't normally descend to directly insulting people in this debate, but if you disagree with that you're actually an idiot. I'm happy to discuss the merits of the various proposals on how we scale, but claiming we don't need to scale at all is either genuine stupidity, or trolling

Why would SHA3 be any more resistant than SHA2?
Short term, any PoW change would remove the head start chinese miners have... but I don't see why SHA3 is any better than SHA2, because neither are currently breakable. The concern is having &gt;50% of the hashpower, not breaking SHA2
That said, if BTC does change PoW algorithm, I'd target something much more ASIC resistant: that seems like the best way to reduce centralized mining. Ethereum is still mostly mined in people's home PCs, for example
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:04:31
Because I'm not sure the two have to be mutually exclusive, and I'm not anti-government or anti-regulation
What I like about Bitcoin is that the government doesn't control the currency itself. Neither my government nor anyone else's can control Bitcoin's inflation, value, production etc.
I don't actually have a problem with the government regulating Bitcoin-related companies and potential scams: I see those things as being beneficial - right now I won't support any ICO because I can't tell which are scams etc. Regulation would at least let me make a relatively informed decision.
I want a currency outside direct government control, that doesn't mean I want a wild-west anarchy as a haven for tax-evasion, fraud, crime, and scams.
You're entirely welcome to disagree, of course - but I think unregulated, mostly-scam ICOs are detrimental to BTC

A post history of trolling against Bitcoin?
If you look carefully, I have a history of calling out both BCH and BTC supporters for bullshit claims: and IMO Rodolfo's statements here do not reveal anyone's true motives. He's putting words in other people's mouths, at best.
You may also find in my history a reasonable amount of helping others with crypto, hardware wallets etc. Or are you basing this entirely on a few comments saying (to supporters of both sides) "You're being unfair" or "You're twisting facts to suit your narrative" - I don't think those count as trolling. Or alternately if you're basing it on my single post titled something like "I don't understand why Bitcoin has value?", try reading the full thread and you'll see that wasn't trolling, but was a genuine learning exercise which led directly to my involvement in the community and holding BTC.
I hold BTC, I've got a reasonably strong interest in things working out well, I've got nothing to gain from trolling. I also use my real account with significant history, because I feel there are too many people hiding behind alt accounts, new accounts etc (strange how your own shows no history when I click your name?). I've got nothing to hide here, I'm just giving an opinion that this post is, at best, jumping to conclusions and grafting incentives onto inconclusive actions

I'd call it more like 1%
Most are scams, most of the rest are ambitious startups that have the best of intentions but will fail anyway
Startups fail all the time, either because someone else does the idea better, because they missed an important factor, it isn't as popular as the company hoped, or it just doesn't work as well as it sounds.
The first questions I ask myself are these:
- Is there a reason this needs to be on the blockchain?
- Why haven't they chosen more traditional venture capital funding?
- Is there any actual benefit to tokenisation
On the last point, I consider "you can use the token as currency on our network!" To generally be a DISadvantage,  because it's a barrier to entry for new users. I'd prefer projects like Etheroll that uses their token for a simple dividend rather than as the actual currency.

Go look at a price chart. BTC has literally always retreated slightly from $1000 increments, typically for &lt;24 hours.
But you somehow managed to miss the fact that the section of my post you quote is merely supplemental to the main point of the news of the Chinese ICO ban, in a "This other possible factor probably didn't help" way, not a "this is the reason for it"
Why are you even posting here? You're adding nothing to the context - are you disagree with me that yesterday was not a big crash, but instead was just a bit of volatility after a new ATH and some slightly concerning (but in the end not too significant) news? If so, perhaps consider discussing that. If not, fuck off, you're clearly just being a douchebag.

Sure, but the volume is already half compared to the previous halvening (unsurprisingly) which means the pressure is already by default halved. But then you take into account several years worth of extra coins, and the much greater ease of exchange now, and you see that the new coins are actually pretty insignificant 
If we see a major price change at the halvening, it's an overreaction 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:25:18
Is it possible? Maybe
But generally even now, people need jobs more than those jobs need specific people. Other than a few highly skilled roles, and a few high-level management positions, the government can afford to say "No problem, we'll hire someone else". Whereas most people, even now, can't afford to say "I'll go get another job unless you pay me in this non-standard currency"
And that's only going to get worse in future with far greater automation and reduced job opportunities
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:07:43

Segwit blocks != "bigger blocks"
They are a different form of scaling. Stop equating them. They do a similar thing, but not in the same way: it is entirely possible to have reservations about one and not the other.
Roger believes, as far as I can tell, that we need 8MB blocks, or SegWit2X (theoretical 8MB blockweight)
Why does that mean he should support SegWit1X (4MB theoretical block weight) when he considers it doesn't go far enough? Why should he support something he doesn't believe in
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:07:30
Yeah this is very much my thought process
Most people do not hold exactly 1 BTC. Even if everyone cashed out when their own holding hits $1mill, that would be spread out over a large range of pricing 
Now I would assume that if we ever hit some huge number like 1 BTC = $1mill, there would be a large scale cash out - but not enough to cause a crash. And most of us would probably have already withdrawn enough to make us wealthy by that point not to be exchanging huge amounts of BTC

I'm sorry but this is misleading. The complaints of the past ~2-4 weeks about high fees were NOT FUD or people overpaying, they were required to get your transaction confirmed in a reasonable time.
They are not necessary *now*, I'll agree, but to classify weeks worth of legitimate complaint and concern as FUD based on a current snapshot of fees, rather than the context at the time, is at best misleading, and probably closer to an outright lie. Fees have been high, please can we not try to whitewash over that fact?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:39:08


No, I can't quantify it better, because **I'M NOT PERFORMING A FUCKING TECHNICAL ANALYSIS HERE**. Jesus fucking Christ. ALL I said was that there normally a retreat from a new all time high.

@_date: 2017-09-10 15:07:23
Because that's an extremely short sighted view
The problem "no longer exists" short term, sure, but long term it relies on LN and similar second layer solutions kicking in and solving the problems faster than transaction growth grows.
I don't think open-ended blocksize increases are necessarily the way forward, 2MB would be a prudent, sensible move to increase capacity over the short to medium term while we, as a community, **properly** evaluate second layer solutions 
The Lightning Network specification isn't even complete yet, and it's being hailed as the guaranteed saviour of the scaling debate. That's ludicrous. It may be the saviour, it may not - but we have no idea which will be the case.
IMO, 2MB would be a reasonable compromise giving us enough time to develop, test, and rollout more second layer solutions and ensure they cover most/all use cases.
Right now, we're putting all our eggs in the LN basket, and that just feels risky

For most people, it probably equates to "The point where the amount of BTC I hold is worth $1 million" or something to that end. But to put a number on it, $50-500k per BTC probably fits for most people. Somewhere between 10 and 100x the current ATH.
I'll withdraw half my "long term hodl" BTC if it ever reaches the point I can pay off my mortgage. Obviously the longer it takes to rise, the more I'll have paid off anyway - so it's kind of a self-moderating target: it may be that in 18 years time I just pay off the last $300 payment with BTC.
The other half will wait until it's worth $1m (not necessarily $1m/BTC, just my holding is worth $1m). Other than that, I'm on the same "to the moon, or to the grave" train.

I didn't say it was big, I said it was small.
And I'm not pushing the technical analysis bullshit - I don't sit drawing lines on graphs. I'm merely pointing out a historical **fact** regarding the price retreating for a day after every major USD milestone.
No pseudo-analysis crap here, I don't believe in it and I'm not performing it. I don't sit talking about "5th wave", nor imagining "support lines" that don't exist. I am stating a verifiable fact that BTC has, until now, always dropped in price shortly after hitting a $x,000 milestone. Go pull up a chart and you can see for yourself. That doesn't mean it always will in future, but right now there are people who are acting based on the fact it has done so historically.
**ALL** I have stated here is that Bitcoin, historically, retreats temporarily on bad news, and shortly after $x,000 milestones. And **ALL** I have drawn from that is "This wasn't a big crash, it was a small fluctuation based on known events"
You're putting words in my mouth and twisting my comments into something they are not. I can categorically state that I do not believe in technical analysis: perhaps I triggered your sensitivities by the use of the word "test", but that's all my post has in common with those.

Of course not. If nobody wanted to buy, the price would be $0
Prices fall when more people want to sell than buy, they rise when more people want to buy than to sell.
The simple fact is that everyone has different attitudes to risk, different information, different goals, and different bank balances. That means we all act at different times in different ways.

Because the costs of moving the world to Bitcoin from Fiat are huge, and why bother when fiat does the job just fine?

Price - not really. Price measures risk, not preference. Most users probably aren’t traders, nor are they good at second guessing the future.
It may be accurate to say that those users who like to try to trade futures oppose S2X, but that really takes a leap of imagination to extend that to “users” - do we have any evidence what proportion of Bitcoin is being traded against those futures? From what I can see of the volume alone it looks to be single digit percentages

As long as you can convert to fiat *somewhere* in the world, though, you can convert it to the fiat of the country you live in.
And the last few countries who don't ban Bitcoin would have a great disincentive to do so, because their currency would likely grow in strength due to the demand of being the BTC gateway.
Most governments are sensible enough to realise that they retain far more control by controlling the exchanges, rather than banning them

Why would he mine blocks he disagrees with? He supports BCH, he supports Segwit2X. He doesn't support Segwit1X.
The entire point of a soft fork is that nodes, miners, and software, all have a choice about whether they implement the rules of it. If you don't like that, promote a SegWit hard fork....


I think you answered your own question. He doesn't support SegWit1X, so is happy to make it look bad. Don't like it? Add your own hashpower to the chain and drown his out. Bitcoin has no governing body, it's decentralized: if you don't like something, compete with it.

I didn’t even support S2X. Literally all I did was clearly delineate S2X and BTC/S1X. S2X will call themselves Bitcoin and BTC too, if they exist, and S1X is a reasonable descriptor of the chain that will have SegWit with 1MB blocks.
I hold BCH and BTC, I’ll likely hold BTC/S1X and S2X (whatever the ticker ends up being) too. I don’t have a dog in the fight here, I’m very literally just specifying whether I’m discussing the 1MB or 2MB chain

I think this (along with crazy high student debts and house prices) is one of the main reasons millennials have such low levels of savings in general.
Saving just seems pointless when prices are going up at 2-3% and your savings are going up 0.25% - I'm just losing 1.75-2.75% of my money every year.
When you feel like you're losing out by having savings, it's easy to justify dipping into your savings account to buy something. When you feel like your savings might double in value at any moment, though, you're more inclined to leave it invested.
I'll withdraw money from Crypto when it allows me to pay off my mortgage or buy a bigger house, because those things seem worthwhile with advantages that go beyond pure finances. Other than that, I want to keep saving. It's the first time in my life I've felt properly incentivised to put money away for the future.
That said, it's important to keep in mind that this is still a gamble.

Sure, but there are already millions of CPUs in the world
The differences being
1. That normal people can CPU mine without investment, using hardware they already own
2. Although rich folk could out-scale me with their money, at least it's still a level playing field per hash. It's not just the investment cost, it's the power cost: 10x more hashpower with an ASIC doesn't use 10x more electricity. ASICs ruin the ability for CPUs to compete economically, even on a smaller scale.
CPU-only mining would be intrinsically more decentralized simply because more people can do it (investment) and can do it profitably (power costs).
ASICs provide a triple whammy of advantages of "reducing decentralization" compared to CPUs:
- Most people don't already own one
- They're expensive
- Once purchased, they out-compete any other mining method on power efficiency (H/w)

At the moment, Bitcoin isn't just deflationary, it's speculative. So $1000 you spend now may be worth $10,000 in a year, if you're bullish. So right now, absolutely - you'd expect Bitcoin to be a bad currency.
But Bitcoin can't maintain exponential/speculative levels of growth forever. At some point, even long before we hit the 21 million coin level, Bitcoin will stagnate. At that point, it works fine as a currency.
Right now, that $1000 you spend may be worth $10,000 in a year. In that case, of course you aren't going to spend it without replacing it.
But what happens when Bitcoin stops growing and plateau's at a future value, and USD has ~2% inflation? Your $1000 worth of BTC now would be worth $1020 in a year's time.
I don't know about you, but the chance of having another $20 in a year isn't going to stop me buying an iPhone now, if I want an iPhone now. And that $20 is actually more like $10, because my fiat account gains interest anyway (well, *my* fiat account currently has 5% interest for the next year, but we'll stick with a more sensible 1% for a real world comparison).
And remember that the store pays 1-2% fees to receive VISA/Mastercard payments currently: so it may well be that paying in Bitcoin is 1-2% cheaper in future, because of that saving...
During the growth phase, I absolutely agree that spending Bitcoin has disincentives if you believe BTC will grow in value compared to USD. After that phase, though, there's really not a huge difference.

No, because those things are not directly comparable: the NASA budget is not intended to all but replace the rest of the budget.

Also, the Wikipedia NASA graph is a bar chart showing the year on year change, not the over-time proportion. It's not trying to display the same type of data as the SegWit chart: if the SegWit chart was a month by month (/week by week) chart trying show monthly variance, it would be fine because that's a fundamental change in the data being shown, and the purpose for showing it

Other than the network effects and much greater public awareness, nothing particularly: BTC is currently about 75% of my crypto holdings, and that's likely to decrease as a proportion over time.
I'm personally about 50-50 on whether BTC will be "the" major blockchain currency we end up with, or whether Bitcoin is the MySpace to the Facebook that will come later.
I'm expecting at least 3 major cryptocurrencies. A store-of-value BTC-style major player, an Ethereum-like smart currency, and a privacy driven cash-like currency like Monero. But I don't necessarily think Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero will be those currencies.

Naive at best
Why would you not *entertain* it? Surely the sensible approach is to develop (it's really not complex) and test it - so that it's ready *if* it's ever needed?
Any sensible project should be ready for a major event like this well before it's actually needed. Sure, it might not be needed - but preparing for such an obvious problem and discovering you "wasted" a little time developing and testing it is far better than needing it and having to rush it through, with the huge inherent risks of failure.
And seriously, this is not some huge development task that needs years of testing: suggestions that it's more than a few lines of changed code are utter FUD. Testing it is prudent, and does take some time - but BCH has already implemented and tested it quite thoroughly for us, which is generous of them.
Develop and test it now, then it's ready if needed. This also gives the possibility of including the block size increase if/when any other hard fork is needed for other features, upgrades, or security fixes as yet unknown. Avoiding an unnecessary hardfork makes a lot of sense... but having this change ready in case it's needed, would allow us to implement it in whatever necessary hard fork comes along

The hashrate can spin up their own nodes.
A node can cost $5/month. $50k/month will buy you as many nodes a Bitcoin currently has.
Nodes are cheap, hashrate isn't.
To be clear, the market and price will determine the winner - I'm just saying that "Run your own node" means virtually nothing. It's hashrate we need next, to ensure the chain survives.

I've seen little evidence of this... the market crashed 30% on a rumour that China was banning Bitcoin. And that was abuut the 7th time.
And if the price crashes fast enough, suddenly mining stops being profitable and gives other miners an incentive to leave too.
Now I'm not advocating this as a most likely outcome.... but I think it's sensible to recognize it as a risk

I'm not going to argue with your analysis of their talents (I've not looked into the various code bases enough to comment), and donating or applauding their efforts seems reasonable... but making decisions about your own financial holdings should not be based on "Giving the developers a pat on the back".

15x would require BTC replacing the equivalent of USD.
10x that, or 150x current prices would require replacing every single currency in the world entirely, plus about another 20-30% depending on which estimate you use.
385x would mean BTC is nearly 3x as valuable as all the currency in the world, plus all the gold in the world.
When people were saying "That can't happen" at $13, they were being unimaginative. But as the value increases, it becomes more sensible because we start to run into actual human-scale limits
If someone had said, at $13, that BTC would go up by 148225x I'm sure you'd have laughed at them too... but that's exactly what you're talking about by saying BTC can go up another 385x
BTC is currently worth circa $100bn. To go up 100x would mean BTC is worth $10tn. That's about as much as all currency currently in circulation. And that's still only just over 1/4 of the 385x you're asking about.
To hit $2m BTC would have to replace all currencies on earth, all gold, all stores of value, and a whole bunch of other stuff. All without other cryptocurrencies taking any of the market.
10x ($50k/BTC) is reasonable. Possibly optimistic, but reasonable. Similarly anywhere in the 10x-50x range is getting more and more optimistic, but it's sort of justifiable if BTC takes a huge chunk out of other currencies. But anyone suggesting 100x ($500k/BTC) probably doesn't actually understand what they're saying. Never mind 385x ($1.9m/BTC)
So going back to the crux of this comment chain: anyone with $300 invested would, even with that 100x estimate, only get $300k back. More realistically they're looking at $15-30k, if everything goes well. It's nice to have, but it's not gonna do much more than upgrade your car, or pay for a few vacations. IMO the main people who would benefit from this are those hoping to buy a house in 5-10 years, at which point $500 now might help you with the down payment and make a significant difference to your life
At $500 last year, 385x would have returned $200k. That was about the last time it was reasonable to hope for 400x gains on BTC. Since then we've gone up 8x, making 50x more reasonable. Even those are very optimistic, though.

Nobody said "longest chain" - greatest proof of work is different to the simple longest chain, and takes **difficulty** into account. The white paper is quite clear on this. Bitcoin has the greatest cumulative proof of work (block height * difficulty)
And how do you define the consensus rules? What we have right now? So any coin that forks is different to Bitcoin? What if we have to hard fork? What about a soft fork?
SegWit changed the consensus rules, does that stop the current coin form being BTC? What about when we want to hard fork to introduce a new feature?

Which really won't make as big a difference as people are suggesting. It's already a fraction of daily volume, and that's before we include 3 more years worth of coins produced.
As we go along, each halvening becomes much less significant: and no, not just half as significant as the last - because of the coins minted in between diluting the mined coins even further.
It might make a small change, but it's not going to change anything fundamental by that stage

NOT adjusted for inflation (by which I mean, if I say $100k, I mean $100k plus inflation) I would say something along the lines of
- Conservatively/Sensibly $10-25k
- Reasonably: $50k - although it would take a lot of things going "right"
- Optimistically: $100k, particularly during a short term liquidity spike. I'm  not sure this is sustainable any time soon though.
Anyone suggesting above $200k is probably looking at past growth rather than the realities of what that would *actually* value BTC as.
Anyone suggesting $1m is dreaming
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:13:00
Unless specified otherwise, I'm usually talking "Per bitcoin" (so a ~$4200 investment right now)
I'm aware that could be a very conservative "prediction" (although I'm not really predicting, as far as it's possible to name a figure without it being a prediction), but I feel that it's a more sensible, if broad, range to base an investment on. $10k is very achievable, $100k would be a very good sum for most people invested now but involves 25x growth from current levels, which would be impressive even at this stage of Bitcoin's development. And while I think crypto is likely to hit a market valuation high enough for $250k BTC, I have my doubts that BTC itself can maintain *such* a dominant market position.
Of course we could one day hit $1m, but I think that kind of figure is bandied about with far more confidence than it actually warrants
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:04:16
Long term, miners will follow users and price: even if they aren't the *same* miners, someone else will come along and provide hashrate because it is profitable.
The question is whether, short term, a loss of hash rate affects the price enough that the price/usage moves to a different chain (BCH, S2X, or possibly a non-BTC-genesis-block altcoin). I think this is looking progressively more unlikely now, as BTC looks to have enough hashrate "staying" to avoid this, although it was looking a little iffy at one stage
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:11:10

The OP_RETURN method is strong if it is required on one chain. The BCH implementation did not require it as first proposed, so it was not strong nor 2-way.

@_date: 2017-10-07 14:40:48
That would be more confusing though, because people have come to understand the 2X to indicate a doubling of block size
BCH2X would suggest the coin is a 16MB blocksize fork of the BCH chain, when it is clearly neither of those things. At best it looks like a 2MB blocksize fork of the BCH chain. It is not that either. This discussion is already confusing enough without being awkward and political about it
B2X is clear enough, please can we not be petty over this and instead be glad people aren’t pissing around trying to refer to both coins as BTC (or inconsistently using BTC/S2X and S1X/BTC or some shit)?

You're quoting laws about "hacking"


How is S2X in any way hacking when, as above, it doesn't involve accessing anyone's computer unless they install the software?
If your focus is on replay attacks, then you need to find laws that prevent someone copying a publicly transmitted transaction onto another chain they control. None of the laws you quote here do that.
You're barking up the wrong tree. You need to be looking at financial laws, laws around trading and securities, not computer hacking.
S2X is a competing standard, the fact it is compatible with another standard is never going to be considered "hacking" in a court.

But that's the "difficult" (I'd argue impossible) part... how do you detect manipulations? Admittedly this specific one is easy, since 200 were spun up in a few hours, more than doubling the count.
This is exactly the reason that the Whitepaper stated nodes shouldn't be used for voting: because IPs are easy and cheap to obtain, the whitepaper stated proof of work miners would vote (because they're proving, through their PoW, that they have a significant stake in the result)
The problem in the whitepaper is that it didn't account for the rise of ASICs in keeping Bitcoin decentralized, meaning miner voting isn't as good a technique as suggested - but that doesn't make node voting a good idea again either

Nothing has elevated (increased) my fear of this type of event. If anything my concern over it has been alleviated (reduced) by a couple of large pools ending their S2X signalling. This means less hashrate is signed up to S2X and there is therefore more hashrate support for BTC
BTC has the “incumbent” advantage in terms of price and economic activity, so can likely survive with less hashrate as long as there is still a good amount of hash power available - enough to ensure blocks are regular and the difficult adjustment will take weeks rather than months.
These additions pools backing out of S2X make it more likely that BTC has “enough” hashrate to survive long enough that economic incentives win out over S2X support from miners, by ensuring “floating” (“greedy”, but in a good way) miners stick with BTC rather than moving to S2X in the scenario I described originally
(Note: when I say greedy miners above, I simply mean that they mine on the most profitable chain, not that they are unethical. I’m referring to the actions we would expect a non-political miner to take)

Don't be ridiculous. Flipping a coin is gambling, and has a ~1:2 (50/50) chance. But Roulette has a 1:37 odds, and is still gambling. The lottery has 1/100,000,000 etc.
Just because BTC is not fixed-odds gambling, doesn't stop it being gambling. All investments are gambles.


**HAS** outperformed. Not **WILL** outperform. Assuming the past will repeat itself is the easiest mistake to make when investing.
Now again, to be clear, I hold BTC: I do not thing BTC is a bad investment *in the right circumstances*. But it's still a gamble. If it wasn't a gamble, it wouldn't be worth investing in.
The market isn't stupid: if BTC had a 100% chance of being worth $100k in 5 years, it would be worth a hell of a lot more than $5k now, because people would realize there's $95k profit to be made.

I believe it’s the same thing from a different angle. 2032 is when the block reward period that gets us to 99% happens, but at that point 99% have not been mined.

Of course not. If nobody wanted to buy, the price would be $0
Prices fall when more people want to sell than buy, they rise when more people want to buy than to sell.
The simple fact is that everyone has different attitudes to risk, different information, different goals, and different bank balances. That means we all act at different times in different ways.

Long term, of course economic activity matters most. But we're talking about the immediate shock of a high % of hashrate leaving a chain within the space of a block. There's no feasible amount of economic activity that could counteract that level of uncertainty.
But are you telling me that Bitcoin wouldn't have been in serious trouble if, for example, 95% of hashrate had moved to the S2X fork, with one block every ~5 hours, and months until the next difficulty adjustment? You're telling me the market wouldn't panic?
Fortunately it looks as though it's now impossible for things to be that extreme, since enough hashrate has confirmed it will stay on the BTC chain... but if it had, economic activity would have all but stopped. At that point, with potentially months before a difficulty adjustment, the market would have had to face up to a possibility of BTC losing to S2X

With $100, probably not
Diversify once you have enough invested (across all areas of your life) that if \*whatever you're invested in\* vanished overnight, you would be in financial trouble.
At that point, you should start spreading your money around, for example in different stocks, shares, bonds etc (ideally in different economic sectors, not all in airlines or pharmaceuticals), property, savings accounts etc.
When people talk about diversification within crypto, they often mean ensuring that you don't put all your eggs in a single basket - eg in a single altcoin. The principle is exactly the same as above, but you're still at risk if the entire sector (cryptocurrencies) tank: that's why you want to diversify on a broader basis too, with non-crypto assets.
That said, you shouldn't invest more than a couple of hundred dollars in Crypto unless
- You have no unsecured debt
- You have a plan for retirement
- You have an emergency fund of at least ~3 months income/salary
If you do not have these three things covered, stay the hell out of high risk investments. A couple of hundred bucks as a "roll of the dice" to see what happens is one thing, but don't invest anything it would hurt to lose.

The problem with ASICS is that it moves BTC away from the "everyone runs it on their home computer" original kind of intention. (Perhaps a little over-simplified, but you get the idea)
Newer ASIC competitors will improve things, but mining will always be more centralized with dedicated miners rather than commodity/consumer hardware. Even with the latter, it will be geographically biased around low power costs, but ASICs make that much worse.
It's not so much "OMFG too much centralization" - just that the "votes" will be coming from a smaller sub-set of users, rather than pretty much everyone voting

Long term, a good development is absolutely vital - and is certainly a factor to take into consideration for your own choice of which to support... but short term it has very little impact on price if one chain loses too much hashpower.
To be clear, I'm not saying this: 


I'm saying that in the days immediately after the fork, hashrate is important, particularly for BTC. If you can add hashpower to BTC, that's worth more than a node, or developers are **in the short term**.

Bitcoin can survive a lot, but I'm not convinced it can survive 95% of hashrate leaving in one go, to another chain with the same transaction history.
Thankfully it's looking like that isn't going to happen, and more like ~20-30% of hashrate will stay (enough to ensure survival long enough that, assuming BTC will have the economic activity, the price will remain high and miners will be forced to return).
We're fortunate that we're discussing what's looking like a hypothetical situation: but even 80% of the hashrate leaving at once would be painful.

"Bitcoin won't replace fiat" is not the same as "Bitcoin can't succeed". Don't put words in my mouth
Success can be defined in many ways, and Bitcoin can succeed in a huge number of ways without replacing fiat. By complementing it, adding to it, performing services and tasks that fiat cannot, and by providing access to areas of the world without financial infrastructure etc.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:17:56

That's the part that's hard to work out: this sub is an echo chamber, and I don't think it's a secret that dissenting opinions are liable to removal. The other sub is no better.
There's no real way to measure support: the original intent of Bitcoin is that the miners vote (cite: whitepaper) but that didn't seem to envision relatively centralized ASIC mining farms in China, so isn't as inclusive as intended.
Gauging Reddit or Twitter for an idea of how much support there is can be *very* misleading (take any recent political event, Brexit, Trump's election etc), since Reddit and Twitter by definition only capture the thoughts of their users, and both are very vulnerable to brigading, spam accounts etc. With, again, no real way to measure how much support is organic and how much is manufactured (and I apply this to every side of the debate)
The BTC/BCH fork is a prime example on this: to browse Twitter or this sub, BCH didn't stand a chance of surviving a week, and should be dumped ASAP. Now, it's definitely too early to call it a success... but it's certainly still here 2 months later. No July estimate of the support for BCH based on these factors was even close.
Nodes don't work for the same reason as Twitter/Reddit, since anyone can spin up 1000 nodes for $5k/month and have 10% of all Bitcoin nodes. 10 people/banks with $5k a month can therefore take a "majority" of node votes instantly.
Mining signalling is still the only vaguely accountable voting system Bitcoin has, since it proves you are spending significant (much more significant than running nodes) money to run the network, and have a vested (hardware) interest in Bitcoin succeeding... but that has the problem of skewing the vote towards whatever is in the interests of those who mine.
The only real way to find out how much support there is, is to fork and see what happens. As for "is it worth it" - well supporters will say yes, opponents will say no... but then we're back to the "How much of that support is fake for each side?" question, and still have no way to measure it other than to fork and find out.
The only other way I can think to try to measure support is to use some kind of Proof of Stake system, but then it just becomes "the wealthy decide everything", and, well, what's the point of moving away from fiat?

It's an obvious excuse to use to push an agenda. The same as how terrorism is used to scare the public into allowing various anti-privacy laws through.

The OP_RETURN method is strong if it is required on one chain. The BCH implementation did not require it as first proposed, so it was not strong nor 2-way.

Split it into thirds, ABC.
Give AB, BC and AC to three different people/three different secure locations (eg two family members and your lawyer)

Just make sure that no one (or two, if you’re paranoid) people/locations can retrieve your money, and that you can absorb the loss of at least one of the copies.

So what about the hard forks that have happened since the first BTC release? Do they mean the current chain isn't Bitcoin? What about when we inevitably need a hard fork for another reason?
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:42:16
Yes, but going from $13-$5k is very different to starting at $5k. Bitcoin is still likely to increase in value, but we're not going to see it go up 385x again. $2m BTC in any timeframe worth talking about is just ridiculous: it's not gonna happen in our lifetimes, because BTC would have to literally replace most of the world's currency without even losing any ground to any other Crypto.
Comparing the move from $13-$5k to a move from $5k-$2m and expecting the latter is naive at best. Bitcoin now is very different to Bitcoin in 2013
If you currently hold something in the $5-20k range, you're likely, all going well, to see good returns. You probably aren't going to be a millionaire (maybe, just about, at the $20k end), but you might be able to pay off a chunk of the mortgage or buy a bigger house. That kind of money that makes your life much more comfortable, but you still have to work.
If you hold $500-1k, you're unlikely to see enough to change your life, although you might be able to buy a new car. Nice to have, sure, but you're not going to live your life "like most people can't"
A 10x increase is reasonable, 50x is possible, 100x is a pipe dream. If you hold less than $1k, you're probably not even going to pay off the mortgage.

While your last point is true, remember that there's a big difference between jumping from pennies to thousands, compared to thousands up to millions.

**NO YOU CAN'T**
In the US (and most other countries with capital gains taxes) you pay **when you dispose of the asset** not **when you cash out to fiat**.
When you sell Bitcoin, for **anything** (crypto, USD, other fiat, a house) you have encountered a taxable/chargeable event.

But this thread is talking about most people ("many") having to run full nodes, when that's really not needed. And either way, individuals running nodes isn't going to make a huge difference.

The point is that when there are 3 chains using the same proof of work algorithm, any chain with the original BTC difficulty adjustment algorithm is very vulnerable to a “death spiral” (a bit of a melodramatic name)
If either chain has too little hashpower, the miners can move to the other chain, or BCH. At that point, 101 blocks could be a LONG way away, when blocks are taking ~90 minutes.
If I were a miner I’d avoid a chain with a reward that far away until things settled a little - and if others did too, it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:18:22
I'm not trying to coin anything, S1X and S2X are clearly useful acronyms to (temporarily) differentiate between the two potential forks.

Claiming either as the winner now is far more biased than you're trying to suggest I am being by saying S1X

Because when you spend and replace BTC, you may cost yourself a 1.5% fee to re-buy, but you also help stimulate adoption and growth.
If we all spent (and re-bought) 20% of our salary each month in BTC, we'd probably see the price rise a lot because of the extra activity and adoption... for the cost of 0.3% of your monthly salary in Coinbase fees.

NiceHash is a good way to do the latter: a modern GPU will get something like 0.01-0.02 BTC ($60-120 at current prices) per month. From which you need to subtract electricity costs, of course.
I wouldn't recommend buying hardware to mine, but using hardware you already have can be a nice little bit of BTC.

That hope is rapidly vanishing
- Development is centred around one group of developers (not intended to be contentious: I'm not commenting on their capability or intent here)
- Mining is predominantly in a few large pools in one country
- Most trading activity happens on a few exchanges
Some of that (exchanges) will improve over time, but some appears to be getting worse (mining) or staying about the same with little sign of change (developers)
Nodes are mostly decentralized, mining is still decentralized enough to be functional, and all have scope to improve... but also to get worse

Pro-tip: disagreement and trolling aren't the same thing
Although to be clear, I think much of the content in btc is orchestrated nonsense and focuses far too much on "We don't like Core, so everything they do must be wrong" crap. I disagree with that automatic opposition just as much as I disagree with the automatic support shown here
[Here]( are [some]( examples [of]( me [calling]( rbtc [out]( for things like blindly supporting or attacking a group etc. In several of those links I call out rbtc posters for attacking Core.
tl;dr: I consider both communities to contain toxic elements at the moment, and try to call out BS on both sides.

The price pumped a couple of times, dropped a couple of times etc sure - but it didn't crash as people flooded exchanges with the coins, and it's held a fairly constant value
You're confusing the above with the fact that BCH was never 1:1 with BTC's USD value. That's a very different proposition
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:22:54


Why? Has anyone else even suggested they may?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:28:21
The exchanges can efficiently split all their coins in one go with a single tainted transaction. You can just make one huge transaction of all your funds, plus a tainted coin 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:32:20
That sounds very sensible.
A Ferrari sounds a lot more fun though. Specifically, a Ferrari sounds like *neeee-awwwwwwwwwwwwww*
Maybe your life is about accruing assets. Mine is about being happy and having fun - if BTC one day pays off my mortgage and buys me a Ferrari, I'll be pretty happy.

You can split the coins yourself. There are at least two ways to do so
1. Get hold of some newly mined coin (even a few satoshis is enough), and "mix" that in with your existing transaction as an input. Since you didn't own the newly mined coin before the fork (and can't own it on both chains at once), the tx will only be accepted by one chain
2. Create a transaction to different addresses on each chain (note: addresses you control). Send the transactions simultaneously, and you'll have send your funds to different addresses - at which point they cannot be replayed on the other chain because they do not exist in the original address
1 is more guaranteed, but harder since you need to get hold of newly minted coins
2 is easier, although only works if someone doesn't maliciously replay **all** transactions to both chains. Even if they do, you only lose the transaction fees on both chains because your funds just go to one of the addresses you own.
Replay attacks are only really a threat when sending funds to an address you don't control
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:30:55
You understand that the whitepaper **explicitly** states that nodes don't **decide** the rules, only **enforce them** right?
It's mentioned at least once, and I believe twice, that due to the fact nodes are basically zero cost, and to avoid the 1-IP-one-vote problem, nodes don't get a say in the new rules?
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:01:08
Sure, but considering this change has been made in direct context of the discussion of full replay protection, and it was mentioned (see the commit comment in this thread) directly in that context, it would be very surprising if it wasn't implemented

That isn’t what he said, though.
He’s saying, basically, that the blockchain makes it easier to verify something is true
You no longer have to contact the University (or, if we extend it a bit, previous employer) to, for example, get a reference or check qualifications: instead you can prove to a new employer that you have the qualifications/experience by showing them the evidence on an immutable blockchain.
It’s the distributed and immutable properties of the blockchain that provide the trust, and the trust that allows the blockchain to prove something is true.
TL;DR: he’s talking about trust, not truth

They already are. The ones signalling S2X are the ones who support S2X. That's literally the entire idea of signalling


Users can switch pools, there are already pools who oppose S2X. Trying to allow people within one pool to signal for either would be messy and require development work - the far simpler solution is for users to move their miners to pools that support the same side of the debate as they do.

@_date: 2017-10-12 15:20:04
That isn't true
Without replay protection there is a **risk** that someone will replay your transaction on the other chain. But unless they do so, the coins aren't "stuck together".
Say I have 1 BTC in address A. I create a BTC transaction X to address B. I also create an S2X transaction Y to address C. I own/control all 3 addresses.
I send transaction X to the BTC network, and transaction Y to the S2X network. If they go through okay, my coins are now split and **can never be replayed again** (because the coins are not in the same address, a new transaction will not be valid on both chains)
Worst case scenario is that someone trolls me and replays transaction Y on BTC, or replays transaction X on S2X, moving all my coins to address B or C respectively. I still control all my coins.
The risk of replay attacks are
1. You lose your TX fees if you try the above
2. You cannot send to a wallet you don't control until you have split your coins.
You can also split your coins by "tainting" the transaction with coins mined since the fork. If you create a TX on BTC with coins that were mined after the fork, that TX cannot ever be valid on S2X, and therefore cannot be replayed. And vice versa.
If the fork goes ahead without replay protection, expect exchanges to provide a service whereby they allow you to send coins to them, they replay the transaction (to send the other coin to them too), and then split your coins for you using newly mined coins.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:05:28
No it isn’t
Banks have myriad uses for blockchain technologies without having to use Bitcoin itself
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:36:00
They are, and for example coinbase uses XBT for Bitcoin
But most people tend to settle on one and it becomes less confusing. Eg BTC, BCH, B2X would seem to work quite nicely to refer to the three scaling forks 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:47:07
The biggest issue is that the change is contentious.
It's contentious precisely because some people have claimed it's unreasonable, thereby making their prophecy self-fulfilling.
If Core was clearer about a block size increase timeline, there would be no contentious hard fork - there would simply be a date at which we'd see an uncontentious upgrade to BTC, probably along with some nice other upgrades which also require a hard fork (therefore slotting the upgrade in with some other things, avoiding an extra hard fork etc)
A badly done fork in a contested environment is a bad thing, sure: but it wouldn't have to be if Core could be clearer on the timeline and criteria for block size increases, and start developing it and testing it now (or rather, a year ago) so that it's ready when needed.
The common sense solution to this is to develop and test the block size increase now, and have publicly acknowledged criteria and timings for when it will be implemented. If that was done, there would be no S2X
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:51:01
I’d always make decisions based on events at the time
But at the point 1 BTC matches my actual cash investment, one will be sold to recoup my entire investment. This is looking quite achievable. Then at $100k a couple of BTC will be sold to pay off my mortgage and buy a bigger house. This looks possible, if a little ambitious.
Other than that, I’ll sell if I need fiat, or if half my holding becomes enough to be genuinely wealthy (a couple of million). The latter needs an improbably large increase, if I’m honest, so it’s more likely it would simply be sold if I need the money for something else.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:34:23
That's how you decide whether to follow Bitcoin or an altcoin.
But Bitcoin's rules are decided by the method prescribed in the white paper.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:10:55
Sure, unless the price follows the hashrate first.
The risk for BTC is that too much hashrate moves to S2X, slowing down BTC transactions until the next 2016-block difficulty adjustment. If that happens, it's possible that the price difference we're currently seeing on futures could start to reverse, at which point the "floating" hashrate may follow it, making it worse
By "floating" hashrate I mean the non-politically aligned, profit-driven hashrate. Some hashrate supports BTC (the current S1X version, if you will), some supports S2X, and some doesn't care and will just mine whatever's most profitable.
Hashrate absolutely follows price long term. But short term has a caveat - hashrate follows price *as long as the price is supported by the existing hashrate*. A too-severe lack of hashrate immediately after the fork could scare the market, at which point the price will follow the hashrate (short term) due to long confirmations etc causing a panic. If that panic moves into S2X rather than fiat, it becomes self-reinforcing until the S2X price is higher and the hashrate moves to S2X rather than BTC
I'm not saying this will happen, it's just a potential risk if, short term, BTC loses so much hashrate that the price can't be supported. I was more worried about this a month ago than I am now.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:01:13
Why? S2X is going to be the battle of the hashrate, not the battle of the node count
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:19:32
That has nothing to do with what I'm saying?
I don't believe a blocksize increase is needed right now. I don't even necessarily believe it will be needed in future. I certainly believe that it *may* be needed, and I believe that we should be prepared for it.
As to the question of whether it's necessary in future, I'm happy to leave that until we can see how 2nd layer solutions are performing unless transaction numbers increase to the point it's unavoidable, in which case an increase may be justifiable. I don't see the latter being likely unless 2nd layer solutions are delayed.

1. Faster, less political support for things we want. Even if you oppose BCH, it's annoying when your hardware wallet maker starts "picking sides" in things. Like, stfu and support your customers. My problem here wasn't that Trezor didn't support BCH eventually, nor even that they opposed BCH - my problem was that they did so publicly. It's more the precedent that I can't rely on them if they ever take the "other" side of the debate. Ledger, on the other hand, calmly supported both (although if you dig down enough, their CEO also opposed BCH, he did so privately)
2. Price. The Ledger is cheaper, they do the same thing
3. Availability. I ordered one Ledger, received it, ordered another, and received that too, in the time it took my Trezor to arrive
4. Wider support - the Ledger supports more coins, and is adding Monero which is something many of us have been crying out for
5. The Ledger has a better security element, as noted. It's never been hacked that we know of, the Ledger has. I'll take secure over open source
None of those individually are a deal breaker for Trezor but, taken together, they're the reason I'm a Ledger user who owns a Trezor for redundancy, rather than the reverse.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:41:08
They removed weak opt-in (optional, defaulting to not used) replay protection, as part of adding proper, strong, 2-way replay protection like BCH uses.
This is a **very good thing**. This is S2X's developers bowing to community pressure and making things much safer for **both** communities. For fuck's sake don't discourage it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:44:13
There's no strict definition, because it isn't a real world - but I'm pretty sure most people see "hodl" as "don't trade or sell" rather than "control your private keys"
You can control your private keys but not hodl, and you can hodl on an exchange. It's probably not advisable to do so, but you can do it
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:15:43
Eg? I just agreed with you... developers can reasonably state that they oppose S2X because they’re speaking for themselves.
I’m not putting my money anywhere because I don’t understand the market (ie the actions of others) in enough detail to gamble on them, but I don’t accept that futures prices with such small volumes truly reflect enough definitive user preference to state that the majority of users oppose S2X

While true, Coinbase is still huge: it's not as much of a monpoly as MtGox, but it's by far the biggest fiat-&gt;crypto exchange. A sizeable portion of the crypto being traded on other exchanges was likely purchased via Coinbase
I'm not saying it would necessarily be *as* big, but Coinbase failing would be huge. The point being that a blip from "China bans ICOs" isn't comparable, so the idea that "it recovers more quickly every time" doesn't stack up.

Double. When we talk about block weight it’s essentially “equivalent” to block sizes

This seems like a naive statement.
Regardless of whether you support Core on the **current** debate (and I'm not saying they shouldn't), it's a little strange to declare this kind of perpetual support in future as though the Core team are infallible and things can never change.
I'm rather wary of anyone who makes such a statement - I want my exchanges to analyze each situation as it arises and take the best path for their users and customers.. not just blindly support one group regardless of the situation.

Thanks, there's certainly stuff to think about here: I can see how there's a lot of potential utility involved.
I'm still not entirely convinced that it creates the value we see... but then I suppose the thing is that since you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, you don't actually have to care what the BTC exchange rate is... I can buy 1% of a bitcoin and use it like $20 today.
I think I'm starting to see the benefit of *using* it, if not holding it as an investment. But there again, if there are benefits to using it, that's starting to imply value.

Well, some of the point is that the BCC group think that BTC should be for dust transactions.

Patterns aren't necessarily predictable, and just because something looks like a pattern doesn't mean it is one. Bot trading can work, it can also be an excellent way to fuck up: bots can't react to world events etc.

@_date: 2017-05-09 14:28:56
But don't governments presumably have quite a large potential influence on the currency?
Less, of course, than their influence on Bitcoin - but I can't imagine that if China (where most are created) or the US (where, I believe, most are used and stored) decided to influence BTC, surely that would have a massive impact?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:21:32
It's possible that will end up being the case: but there's no reason it has to be.
It all depends on whether money flows into BTC/BCC from fiat or other cryptos, or whether people only trade on the BTC/BCC pair.

The slight difference there is that CoinBase, prior to the ETH/ETC fork, didn't state explicitly that they would only be supporting ETC. As such, they were on shakier ground.
They're probably still on shaky ground, if BCC forks from BTC and gains value, but less so.

But wouldn't they then rise quite significantly to make up from the loss of mining income, meaning there's less incentive to actually spend money?

I don't think currency is *only* to pay off debts to the government, but as far as I can see it that's the main guaranteed, necessary use of it. Everyone will owe taxes, therefore everyone needs money. Because we all need it, it has value.

I don't have a fantasy world, I just think it's silly to state things like "They were smart for making the right decision"
Well yes, but they were guessing. Perhaps a slightly more educated guess, but they also took a risk. It's standard risk:reward. They took a risk, they got the reward. Others around that time will have taken the wrong risk and lost out, and the OP didn't take as big a risk, so reaped a smaller reward.
The problem is that while you get a bunch of people coming on here going "Lol I sold at $3000 and bought at $1800" you don't get very many who admit they bought at $2700 and panic-sold at $2000.
So yeah, those lucky ones who made a big profit may have been making an educated guess and taking an educated risk, but they were lucky as much as they were smart.

A fork doesn't have to be destabilizing: ETH hardly took a hit at all with the ETC fork. Admittedly that wasn't very contentious within the community
But I maintain that there's a fallacy that a fork can "take over" - any fork will always be an altcoin, by definition. I think most people are smart enough to realize that the spin-off doesn't just scoop up the original value unless it adds something new
Altcoins which aren't forks don't detract from BTC value, because they add their own value and USP. Altcoins which don't have a USP or their own added value... fail
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:21:48
I'm not sure that entirely stacks up - it appears to me that both sides have a valid point: they're both right, they just have slightly different goals
I don't think BCC is throwing away decentralization, nor (surely) does anyone believe SW is the entire answer to the scaling problems of BTC?
To be honest I think the developers behind each vision are acting entirely in good faith, my criticism is of the meme-tastic shitposting going on by people who mostly don't even understand the technology: they just want to see the price rocket immediately

- 100sat = 1c seems fairly likely ($10k/BTC)
- 10sat = 1c seems possible, although reliant on significant changes within the financial world ($100k/BTC)
- 1sat = 1c is possible, but feels like a bit of a stretch ($1m/BTC)
The latter already sounds like a stretch, I can't see anything beyond that being reasonably plausible. That said, most of us would be laughing our way to our desert island if we ever hit $1m/BTC

That isn't really the reason Linux isn't common: the reason Linux isn't common is because none of those distros have been given enough support and development. Fragmentation has been one factor in that, but it's not, IMO, the driving factor.
Ubuntu has been excellent for a few years now, well within the "Replace Windows Vista on your grandparents laptop" territory: my mother's laptop runs Ubuntu, my sister's runs Elementary OS. Linux has been good enough quality for the mainstream for a while. The barrier for Linux is Windows paying OEMs to put Windows on their machines...
I follow your logic, but I think it's based on a flawed assumption. Linux hasn't died off, and has grown significantly. It's also in just about every house in the country - chances are your home has more Linux installations than any other OS. Your TIVO type box is probably Linux, as is your network router, and almost any "smart" device you have. Just because they aren't on desktops, doesn't mean those forks are unsuccessful: in fact, they mostly exist because the companies involved can take Linux, fork it to make it do exactly what they want, then use it. I just counted and I can see at least 8 Linux devices from the chair I'm sat in (and I exclude the home server I built myself, since most people don't have one)
Just because they end result wasn't to make Linux ubiquitous on user-grade desktop computers, doesn't mean that forking hasn't worked: Linux is everywhere. The servers Reddit uses to send this exact conversation to each other are almost all Linux based, as are the vast majority of the servers and hardware between each of our Windows computers and the Reddit servers. And Red Hat is hardly doing badly with their Linux fork.
In fact, the more I type, the more your response seems to support my point: forking has flaws, but generally does a massive amount of good by providing freedom. Freedom not to have to do the exact same thing as everyone else, freedom to tailor things to how you need them. The ability to fork the Linux code base has given Linux an extremely rich ecosystem of different variants. Many of those variants have died off along the way, (Knoppix anyone?) but others have gone from strength to strength.
And let's not forget what happens when a Linux fork is taken and developed, marketed etc properly for a single usage... Android is hardly doing badly, last I checked, with over 2 billion active monthly devices.
Is forking the ideal method for resolving problems? Probably not. Is it the best possible way to promote Bitcoin as a ubiquitous global currency? I'm gonna say no again, you're right... but in terms of providing freedom and decentralization (which, to me, are **the** cornerstones of Bitcoin), it's perfect.
And if that means the value drops in the short term, so be it - I'm here for the technology I believe in, not to make a quick buck (although I believe that even if the fork does create short term volatility, the long term is still rosy for crypto and BTC in particular)

If the market cap splits 50-50 as in your example, I'd still have the same total share of the market cap because the coins split too, and I'd have some of each.

An attitude which is helpful to neither side 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:16:14
Yeah: the main problem I have with market caps is that it assumes every coin has the same value at any given moment.
For the sake of argument, I'll ignore bitcoin divisibility and assign a nice 1000 dollar price right now.
If there are 21m people with 1 BTC each and the price is $1000 per coin, it's easy to say "Okay cool, the market value is $21 billion"
But the reality is that if those 21m people all wanted to sell their 1 BTC, only the first few would actually get $1000 for their bitcoin. The price doesn't actually reflect the value of all bitcoins, it reflects the number of people who want to buy and sell right now
Unless 1 million people want to buy a bitcoin at the same time as that 1 million want to sell theirs, the $21b valuation doesn't make any real sense.
Then again, you could say the same for stock prices: so I think it works "well enough" for comparisons, as long as people don't think that's actually all there is to it. The risk is that some people genuinely believe that the value is intrinsic, rather than a function of demand
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:06:53

NiceHash tends to be slightly less profitable than mining for yourself. You're paying for the convenience of not having to handle 7 different cryptos and convert them to BTC, though, and also from the fact you get regular payouts in BTC, rather than each of 7 different coins once every 2 months.
It's less profitable simply because you're selling hashrate to other people. By definition, then, they're only going to pay less than it costs to buy the coin they want directly. And then NiceHash takes 3% of their money, and 3% of yours.
NiceHash is convenient, but if you're willing to put the work in then you can make more by doing it yourself. The downside being that you get paid less regularly, have to do more work to convert, and that you can end up with a mining pool where you have less than the withdrawal amount.
Eg right now I have 0.046 ETH in NanoPool: I need 0.05 to withdraw. That means at some point, I'm gonna have to mine ETH to get that to 0.05, or my funds are locked away where I can't use them. That's fine for me, because ETH is reasonably profitable anyway: but if that coin had dropped in profitability since I started mining, or if other coins have shot ahead, then it means I'm losing out on daily profit today, to retrieve my money from a week ago.
NiceHash solves that by aggregating the smaller amounts into a single BTC payment. You have to choose for yourself which is most valuable to you. I've ended up sticking to NH for that convenience, but I guess if BTC hits $1m one day, that's $10-40k I've thrown away by losing 1-4% of my earnings. I'm hoping that if BTC hits $1m, though, I'm not going to give two shits about $40k

I've just made a genuine effort to buy BTC though, just a small amount as a test, and so far I've had one exchange (?) tell me I'm not buying enough (£10 seems a reasonable amount, I'm not trying to exchange pennies), and another that won't accept me without a driving license, and a third that won't accept any kind of payment other than a bank transfer.

You can't hard fork BTC and remove Segwit when BTC doesn't have Segwit...
BTCSW and BCC are both forks from the existing BTC trunk: One adds segwit, the other doesn't.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:18:57
You literally don't understand what a fork is. It doesn't stop being a fork just because it's not 50-50.
Also, this is *meant* to be part of the technology, and it's *meant* to be a way to solve un-resolvable problems. There's a reason forking is such a big part of, for example, open source software: it works.
Why is this sub hating so hard on one of the big advantages of decentralized currencies? It's great: if you don't like how something works, you fork it and see if your idea is better. If yours is better it will "win" or survive, while if it's worse it will die off. That's the idea, it's good, it works, stop hating on it.
I feel like people bashing the BCC fork aren't actually interested in the technology, they're just speculators who are only interested in the price of BTC rather than what it actually does.
Having the ability to fork is healthy for a decentralised currency: it means nobody can ever take control of the currency, because the community can simply fork away from them and carry on: and that applies to people on both sides of this debate - your opponents literally can't take your ability to implement your opinion away from you, that's a good thing.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:36:08
I don't "want" anything specific with regard to SW or Big Block (genuinely, I have no strong preference). I want Bitcoin to succeed.
So do the Segwit supporters. So do big block supporters.
The problem is that the two latter groups disagree with the best way for BTC to succeed. And as you prove with your reply, each side is very, very biased towards their opinion (as you'd expect, if they think its' the right answer)
The fact is that nobody right now knows for sure which is actually the best idea for BTC. And the only way we'll ever know is to try both.
But I'm not sure how you think BCC "removing" (how can you remove something that wasn't there in the first place?) SW is reckless? You're aware that BTC+SW will continue to exist, right?
If BTC+SW is better, BTC will succeed. If BCC is better, BCC will succeed. If both are good, both will succeed...
I think you're still missing the point. The market will decide which idea works: that's the beautiful thing about it. All this shouting and memeing going on on both sides of the debate is utterly pointless: we don't **need** to solve this with words, we can solve it by hard forking the currencies and trying both.
What's happening right now in BTC/Bitcoin subs is the equivalent of two scientists arguing over the results of an experiment, when they could just run the experiment and find out.
May the best coin win, and can we please all stop yelling at each other?

A tricky question to answer because there are two things to look at - inflation, and value compared to something else.
Relative to itself, 1 BTC will always be worth at least 1/21millionth of the total amount that BTC is worth (In reality more now, because we aren't at 21 million BTC yet, and because some have been lost)
Relative to fiat, it depends on how much demand there is for BTC in another currency.
While food is priced in fiat (USD), then BTC can always fluctuate based on demand (but never on inflation).
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:57:02
I don't quite see how that stands up.
I agree that it would be sensible for CB to support BCC if there is demand. I also think that exchanges shouldn't be dictating Bitcoin politics to their users.
But at the same time, it's their business - how they run it is up to them. If you don't like the way they're acting, switch to a different service. That's what I'm doing: not because of a particular affinity for BCC, but because I dislike the way they're dealing with the whole situation, and would prefer to support a more customer-centric exchange

It's the really great thing about crypto, to me: it doesn't have to be a democracy, it can be an everything-ocracy
Democracies are great when everyone has to work within one system: you follow the majority. But there comes a time when you realize democracy has failed in some way, and instead you split off and make your own version. Think, American Revolution, splitting off from British democracy.
It's not that British democracy was bad: it's just that it didn't work for America anymore: they needed their own democracy.
IMO, that's how crypto forks work: some proportion of the community disagrees with the majority consensus, so they split off and do their own thing.
I don't see why we can't hope it works out for both: at the end of the day, they're aiming to do slightly different things (otherwise, there wouldn't be an issue on the repercussions of different scaling strategies), so it's not even like they have to directly compete.
If anything, I'd call BCC more of a threat to LTC/DASH than to BTC, because it's trying to be cash

I'd agree with that definition.
At the end of the day, neither BTC+Segwit nor BCC/BCH tomorrow will be the same as BTC today: I'd argue that both are new currencies.
Bitcoin will fork into BCC/BCH and BTC+SW. One of those will keep the BTC ticker, but neither are actually exactly the same currency.

@_date: 2017-07-28 19:30:26
That's not what I'm saying: I'm saying that the ability to hard for is good
Whether a hard fork itself is good is generally decided pretty damn quickly by the community: as you can see from the Open Source world, where forks for bad reasons (technical, political, whatever) almost always either die off quickly, or limp along for a while but with no real backing
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:37:56
Why does it have to be a competition?
And the idea that "everyone is doing better than me" is laughable. I have good returns. Some people do better, others do worse. There are stories in this sub every week of people doing significantly worse, and stories of people doing significantly better. Both groups are taking bigger risks than I am.
I don't think their success is luck, I just think that attributing a risky play to "being smarter" without accounting for the fact they also got lucky is silly.

I'd still have 65GB a day to assign to upload. 
And remember, that block space isn't wasted - if it's full it's because it's useful and people are using the network. So we'd need more nodes regardless. This isn't wasted bandwidth, it's useful bandwidth

No, but then you're singling out a very small niche (&lt;10%?) of global operating systems and declaring Linux to be a failure. Linux is successful, even if it isn't successful as a desktop OS.
By that measure, BCC may become fantastic cash-like currency, while BTC becomes a fantastic store of value. While both continue to suck as physical coins and notes. In fact, let's explore that possibility of two forks diverging from a shared origin.
Linux may not be the desktop OS of choice, but OS X is a fantastic desktop OS. Admittedly my metaphor hits a slight snag here because OS X is UNIX, but Linux basically started out as a Unix clone - and although they don't share a code base, they do share a large amount of software and approach...put me in an SSH terminal on OS X or on UNIX and I'd have to go deliberately take some actions to work out which I'm in. That's close enough to a "fork" for the sake of this already-stretched metaphor, I think: they started in the same place, and diverged.
So assuming the Linux/Unix purists will allow me that slight stretch, Linux and OS X both grew out of UNIX. From a very similar base (UNIX-like operating systems), OS X became a fantastic desktop OS and Linux became a fantastic appliance/server OS. And both became superb mobile operating systems (iOS and Android)
Just because you start in the same place, and take a different path to a slightly different goal, doesn't mean you can't both succeed. Nor that you can't come back to the same end result, when we look at how both converged again and became iOS and Android, the two most popular operating systems in the world
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:39:05
That very much depends on the hashrate BCH attracts.
With 1% of Bitcoin's current hashrate, 3 days. With 5%, just under a day. Absolute worst case is probably about a week, but I think that's unlikely as it would require something like 0.3% of current hash power.
Although it's probably worth noting that, to some extent: if BCH appears to have value, miners may move to it. If BCH doesn't appear to have value, nobody will be trading it anyway and the capacity doesn't matter.
There will definitely be some delay at the start, but you're looking at 1-7 days to stabilize. And there's no real rush to stabilize, as mentioned: August 1st is a completely arbitrary date.

That's definitely a fallacy: BTC and BCC do not have an A+B = 1 relationship.
If the markets decide both currencies have a future, the BTC and BCC price on August 2nd could easily be higher than BTC was on July 31st.
Equally if the markets think this fork damages the future growth of BTC, or investors think it introduces risks to their money BTC could drop in value, without BCC gaining that same value.
Why? Because price is based on current demand and future value.
Now, you'd expect the current BTC price to roughly reflect BTC+BCC future prices together, because the market is aware of the split: but that's no guarantee it's the case.
We could just as easily see both coins hit $10k from the mainstream media attention, as see both drop to $0 because everyone decides the crypto idea doesn't work. In reality, we'll see something more sensible in the middle, but the idea that BCC being worth $100 causes BTC to drop $100 just doesn't stand up to scrutiny
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:11:14
To over-simply your answer here, then - would it be fair to say that at least a proportion of the value comes from the fact it is not government controlled: in essence, it's free from outside influence, other than the risk of people potentially spending lots of real money to create more of it... so people feel they can trust it, in much the same way that gold prices tend to rise in times of crisis?

Exactly - I genuinely don't care which wins in terms of the technology: I think both concepts have positive and negative outcomes and that there's no "right" answer. But as you say, pragmatically I will see a potential opportunity if the BCC price is low enough, and will invest to some extent.

The limits don't stop you moving your BTC to another wallet, do they? Only converting back to USD.
As for the dividend/share argument, it will depend on where you live whether that legal argument holds water: in the US, it may do so, because BTC is counted as "goods". In the UK, where BTC is seen as a foreign currency, it may not.
That said, CoinBase have specifically stated that they will not take option (2): if they start supporting BCC, they will give you access to BCC equivalent to the BTC balance you had at the moment of fork split.
Option (4) would be utterly stupid of them, and I can't see it happening.
The option they have stated is that they will go with is (3), they will simply never touch the BCC - unless they later decide to support BCC, in which case they will present you with a wallet containing the BCC as described above.
(1) is not presented by them as an option, although you can implement it yourself by withdrawing your coins now

The first few blocks will be slow, yes: but August 1st is an arbitrary date anyway. Being launched on Aug 1st but not particularly useable until Aug 3rd isn't a huge issue surely? It's functionally equivalent to launching on Aug 3rd. And remember that their blocks have a higher capacity: so although transaction latency will suffer badly, transaction throughput will only be affected by a ratio of 1:8 compared to the latency.
Either way, it's temporary:
Once they get down to 1 hour per block, the BCH 8MB blocks will have ~33% more capacity than 6x 1MB blocks per hour we have now.
Some transfers will be slower, but hourly capacity will be higher.

I agree, but that isn't a direct "+$100 on BCC is -$100 on BTC" situation, that's people playing the market.
It's a related influence, but not the same as the idea that 1 BTCSW + 1 BCC = 1 BTC now
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:30:41
I'd agree, although there's a valid point that we know exactly how much BTC has been mined, whereas we have no real idea how much USD/EUR is in circulation: only vague guesses.
So to some extent, it's also significantly easier to calculate a "market cap" for BTC than for EUR/USD, which may be a factor in why it's quoted. Working out the same for USD is pointless
Also, BTC is still a kind of minority currency that people don't work with daily. As such, it's helpful to give a frame of reference within a currency they do understand: BTC's "market cap" is really more of a "What is Bitcoin (rather than 'a bitcoin') worth".
Bitcoin Market Cap is mostly used to give people an idea of the scale of the project and currency
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:42:54
No it couldn't - VPN is a specific thing
But I think this is being blown out of proportion: VPN as a concept/protocol hasn't been banned. Public "Pay us $6/month for anonymity" VPNs have
I've been talking about this for months: NordVPN/ExpressVPN etc are going to be the next targets in the anti-piracy fight governments have been waging for a couple of decades.
They don't need to ban VPN users, or block the VPN protocol - just shut down the companies running these types of services (easy, inside their own borders), and block access to the ones outside their own country (harder, but they can do enough to dramatically reduce the number of users)
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:28:53
Yes you could: You'd just need a shitton of hash power.
As long as you can keep your hash power slightly higher than the BTC hash power for a sufficient amount of time, you can attack BTC. That's how a "51% attack" works (although 51% is a bit of a misnomer, it's actually a &gt;50% attack)

The altcoin is the one with less initial adoption, surely?
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:21:15
Yeah it's hard to find a true apples-to-apples
IMO the real comparisons are rent/wage and house price/wage ratios,  the price of a typical "necessities" food/toiletries etc shopping basket to feed a family for a week, and the difference between minimum wage and the 50th/80th percentiles. Those things give a better indication of how "healthy" the economy and currency are for a normal family
In the US, I'd add healthcare costs/wage ratio to that
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:56:13
That isn't really how it works.
Having 1% of the BTC hash power isn't a big issue unless the BCH chain appears to be under attack. Lots of coins work just fine with a fraction of 1% of the BTC hash power: hash power isn't an absolute thing, it's a relative one. That's why difficulty exists.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:37:07
That's nonsense. The current proposition is 8MB blocks, which wouldn't be full for a long time.
Even when full, with 8MB blocks every 10 minutes, you're only talking about a little over 1GB/day, or about 34GB/month.
My phone's data cap is 2x larger than that. My iPad's data cap is 2x larger than that. My home internet data cap is infinite. My $7/month VPS server's data cap is 57x larger.
So I currently have, just on my VPS server (which, let me re-iterate, costs me $7 per month), enough monthly bandwidth to download 5 years worth of blockchain data per month. Assuming it was actually maxed out at 8MB, which isn't likely to happen for years. And that isn't including my home connection, which is unlimited.
The bandwidth argument is bullshit: I've literally used use more than 34GB of data this month just by watching Game of Thrones and Formula 1.
There are arguments against 8MB blocks, but the bandwidth one is a load of crap: it's already irrelevant for most people, even if we ignore the decade or more before the blocks actually grow that large. Even internet speeds in most of the 3rd world will out-strip blockchain data growth.
And that's only if you want to run a node. Most people don't.

@_date: 2017-07-24 16:53:34
I think you're coming at this from the wrong direction.
The real question should be "Can CoinBase be obligated to provide you, on demand, with the private key to a wallet containing BTC to the value they hold for you?"
This would deal with the issue you mention, because they don't have to provide you with a service for every Tom, Dick, and Harry BTC fork: they just have to give you "proper" access to the private key of your wallet on demand.
Now, this could raise separate questions regarding security, but morally I think it should be the case. Either that, or they just remove withdrawal limits, since withdrawal limits seem like a fairly ridiculous concept for cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:49:05
First up, I'll argue that market cap is a nonsense
But if you mean "The amount of money invested in crypto" stays constant, then you'd assume BTC would drop. At the same time, it's entirely possible that people hold their BTC and instead swap existing altcoins for BTC.
Eg if BCC is $50, I'd probably dump a couple of ETH to buy a few BCC. I mine ETH, so I have a nice ready supply, but equally you could argue that BTC is going to be most volatile in the next few weeks, so I'm more beneficial using the relatively stable (right now) ETH or ZEC instead.
And you're also assuming the total investment in crypto remains constant. I've got $500 I'll be investing around August 3rd-10th depending what happens: I doubt I'm the only one who sees this as a potential opportunity and is looking to invest a little.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:10:26
To some extent, it's people who figure that BTC will retain value after Aug 1st, but that BCC will exist and have at least some value. For the sake of argument, let's call it 10%
If you have $1000 in BTC and $1000 in altcoins to keep your portfolio diverse, you will end up with $100 worth of BCC. If you move your $1k of alts to BTC, though, you'd have $200 worth of BCC (in exchange for a risk in the form of the possibility that BTC price tanks and your total $ value drops)
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:18:17
There are already hundreds of crypto's, I don't think hundreds of forks would necessarily be much worse.
But that aside, you're assuming there would be hundreds of successful forks. Most forks will have no reason to exist, and therefore are dead before they even start. Most forks which do have some reason to exist, also fail.
Like with altcoins, only a few can succeed: and only where they add something that the others don't. Litecoin has fast transactions, ETH has the Eth VM, ZEC/Monero/DASH have privacy (and are fighting to see which "wins"
Quite simply, we won't end up with hundreds of forks. Two, maybe three tops, are the most we're likely to see - and even then, all but one will always be clear second rate citizens.
People aren't particularly confused about the existence of ETH/ZEC etc, nor about ETH/ETC... I'm not sure it's a big deal
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:19:49
ETH already has 4.33x as many coins in circulation as BTC ever will, and that number will continue to increase.
ETH's market cap may beat BTC's in future, and it came reasonably close recently. But the individual coins are very unlikely to hit anything resembling $1m
If BTC hit $1m, **and** ETH doubled it's market share, **and** ETH stopped producing more coins right now, ETH would be worth about $350k.
That's one very ambitious assumption, one fairly ambitious assumption, and one "literally not-gonna-happen", which would all have to happen at the same time for ETH to even be worth 1/3 of that $1m.
Realistically, even if Crypto takes off heavily, ETH succeeds, and BTC hits $1m, we're probably looking at an ETH value of $100k. Which still makes it a pretty damn good investment if that happens.

@_date: 2017-07-28 21:51:55
No, the original would still be Bitcoin, the other would still be an alt - it would just be an alt that has surpassed Bitcoin in value and adoption
If you mean the fact that the currency can change... well, that can happen with Fiat too. The Dollar didn't always exist - until 1775 the British colonies in America used Sterling (or rather, the variant of it that existed then), although Spanish dollars were often accepted. Then Continental Currency was used, before the introduction of the US Dollar.
The same can be said for the relatively recent switch to Euros in much of Europe.
And that's not even including the fact that Bitcoin itself is already supplanting Euros and Dollars in some uses.
I take your point that when there's a fork, it can add some confusion or uncertainty: but for most people who will hold both currencies after a fork (unlike with a fiat currency change, where you own one or the other), it's not actually that big of a deal.

If used properly by "real" projects, they could be a great asset. But right now, it feels more like a bunch of fancy looking scams hoping to sucker in some speculators.
If their ideas are so great, why are they trying to crowdsource their funding $100 at a time? $20m is small fry in the investment world
Some ICOs may do well, but I strongly feel that overall, ICOs are a huge bubble. It feels exactly like the Dot Com bubble of the 90s - massively over-ambitious ideas trying to get regular people to invest small-medium amounts. Unfortunately, they're being targeted at the generations of 15-35 year olds who don't remember the Dot Com bubble.
Some ICOs are, I'm sure, genuine and will become profitable. Some more, I am equally sure, are well intentioned but destined to fail despite the good faith of the developers, just because the idea isn't good enough, or won't catch on. And the last group is "me too" scams, by people who've noticed the trend and realized they can make a quick buck with a fancy website, a few diagrams, and a whitepaper.
You're talking about a couple of weeks work to think of something plausible sounding, write a whitepaper (most of which are below the technical quality of a Computer Science undergrad dissertation proposal, and below the economic quality of an Economics or Business Studies undergrad dissertation proposal), put both on a professional looking website, try to build some hype, then create a contract and dump as much of your own money in as you can in the hopes other people think it's popular.

Deposits need to be confirmed by the exchange.
Exchange transactions within the exchange don't. They already know your BTC balance, so they credit you with a BCH balance. They don't need to wait for any confirmations beyond that, because they control the BCH: there are no blockchain transactions going on, they just update the numbers in their own system.
Deposits will be potentially slow, but if you send your BTC to the exchange now, your BCC should be tradeable as soon as they activate it, regardless of the block time on the BCH network

IMO, both groups have their flaws, but I'm not going to pretend I understand the politics of it enough to truly comment.
At the end of the day, the blockchain has to scale if BTC is to grow. The two groups seem to disagree on how to do that: I'm of the opinion they're both being childish about it and are focused to much on one group or one use case.
ABC could be accused of being miner focused, BTC Core could equally be accused of not making BTC useful as a cash-type currency and focusing it on large scale enterprise use, international transfers etc. Neither group help regular users, but I'm not qualified to decide which group is most right or most wrong.
With ABC's vision, I think we'll see BTC gain more "regular user" adoption, particularly in the developing world, but lose out on a lot of the large scale market value of things like international transfers and store of wealth: giving us a more "useful", but less valuable, crypto currency, with the obvious "this is good for miners" point that it would increase transaction rates hugely and give them big profits.
With BTC Core's vision, I suspect we'll see BTC become "CryptoGold" to ZEC/XMR/DASH's "CryptoCash". We'll hold our wealth in BTC with relatively stable value, and then convert to ZEC/XMR/DASH etc to use it day to day, but not as a store of wealth. That makes it a relatively good investment, but not so great for users.
But that's just my 2c, a fairly naive (technically speaking) interpretation, and in no way suggests I can see why either is intrinsically better than the other, or more deserving of being called BitCoin.
Maybe we do need a split, into equivalents of BitCoin Cash and BitCoin Asset. That said, if we're going to pick one or the other I think I'd prefer BTC Core's direction, assuming I'm right about the result, because I think XMR/ZEC/DASH can pick up the "useful day to day crypto cash" side of things better than BTC can.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:12:00
Of course. Although initially I'd suggest you avoid and - right now both are embroiled in a meme-tastic debate over blockchain scaling (something you probably don't care about yet, since it's about some of the intricacies of the technology)

@_date: 2017-07-31 15:17:53
That's an attack, though, not an intrinsic issue.
You could do that to any crypto currency, it's just a lot more expensive for some than for others
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:26:57
Fundamentally it's the same thing - both values are simply a description of how much people want them, compared to their availability.
The reason people come to their valuation is rather beside the point.
Bitcoin itself has value, based on prediction of future use and usefulness. Just like any other currency.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:06:17
That's down to the exchange operators - the fact is that as long as it's under their control, it's up to them to split it/replay it etc.
If you're running an exchange and don't have the technical ability to split the funds yourself, nor the confidence to do so, then you shouldn't be running an exchange.
I could understand the concern if BCH didn't have replay protection, but it does.
And as an aside (although not directly relevant to this discussion) exchange, you don't even need 2-way replay protection to be confident that your own supply has been properly split: you can just "attack" your own funds to split them.
Replay attacks are a problem for those who aren't aware of them, in systems which don't have 2-way replay protection. If you're an exchange, and for this particular fork, neither of those things are relevant.
Your position is "I wouldn't allow BCH/BTC trades until I'd split my funds", which seems over-kill. My position would be a simpler "Trade all you want, but no withdrawals for the time being"
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:13:53
It might, but if the 8MB is full then that's because BTC is popular and people want to make 8MB worth of transactions... at that point, the question isn't "Is 8MB good" the question is "How do we scale to 8MB? (And beyond)"
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:19:10
Well no, but a lake next to a river wouldn't be a fork either... whereas a river that splits into a small stream and a larger river would still be a fork.

There are two ways to look at mining
1. Short term, maximising profits
2. Long term, trying to direct a coin you believe in, in the direction you believe it should go.
You may decide to mine the less profitable coin now, because you believe it has greater long term potential. This may particularly be the case if you believe in the coin itself and have invested in it directly

@_date: 2017-07-24 15:36:43
Sure, but which is the clone?
Being able to split the chain is, to some extent, one of the strengths of BTC: being decentralized is a core idea of BTC, being limited and deflationary were never the original USP. No one group (miners, users, developers) should ever be able to dictate the direction of Bitcoin.
And deciding which is the "original" and which is the "clone" is up for debate: BCC claims they're following the original whitepaper, Segwit2x can claim the "main" development team. Depending on your perspective, either could reasonable claim to be the original.
To be clear, I have no "side" in this debate, I don't actually have a  fully formed preference for any of the proposed options: I just don't think it's as clear cut as you're making out
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:21:56
I can see why they feel they should do this with their existing pools, considering they've signed the agreement.
But to me, that means they shouldn't move their existing pools away from BTC1, not that they can't create a new pool for BCC.
Anybody who supports the Bitcoin community should, IMO, provide both options: not because they explicitly want to endorse either option, but because their customers/users deserve the ability to choose.
I know other pools may exist for BCC, but the same providers as we currently have providing BCC pools would provide a much healthier ecosystem.
Supporting the technology doesn't mean you support the politics, just that you're helping your users.
I suspect BCC is dead in the water, but I dislike the fact some people are making that a self-fulfilling prophecy, rather than actively helping the community decide, which feels like more of a "Bitcoin-ethos" approach.

This is just childish
If you oppose the coin, let them succeed fail on the concept and technology (thereby proving them wrong on the fundamentals), rather than because it's hard to Google.
If the coin fails on it's own lack of merit, the question is answered. If it fails because of FUD, manipulation, and nonsense like trying to propagate a poor choice of name, then the debate continues for years with accusations of interference.
This applies for both sides of the argument: the fork is apparently happening, let it happen and let the market decide. That's the idea

Which is a great ideology. The practicality is that, at least in the short-medium term, debit cards are the way to get widespread adoption.
Get shops and businesses accepting BTC via VISA now, and they'll soon realize that they're wasting money on VISA fees, after which many will probably start accepting BTC direct (and VISA will have to start offering something more in exchange for their fees)

Wow you're toxic as hell. I'm doing just fine, thanks, with no need to be envious: I don't judge myself by the success of others. I could probably have made more optimal decisions, but I balance my own risk:reward and am happy that thus far I've made pleasing rewards based on risk levels that I'm comfortable with
If they did well out of them, then I'm delighted for them: it does me no harm that they've played it well. I just think calling someone else an idiot for not taking the same risk is pretty low.
Then again, you're proving yourself to be a troll the more you reply.

A developed economy grows at a typical 2% a year. That means roughly 55 years to triple in value.
An American aged 23 now should, therefore, expect to see the economy triple between now and the time they die, assuming growth rates stay the same and they live to their life expectancy

Individual value, or market cap?
On individual value, I doubt more than ETH (Ethereum), XMR (Monero), DASH, or ZCash (Zero Cash) have much chance of actually beating BTC due to the first mover advantage.
BTC has first mover advantage, so any other coin needs a significant unique feature, otherwise they're just a "me too!" copycat hoping to ride the Crypto train. If a coin doesn't have a unique feature, there's no reason to use it instead of BTC, and it exists purely because someone thought they'd try to cash in on the hype without adding any value. They mostly exist because the creator pre-mined a bunch of coins and is hoping it'll get a speculator bubble they can cash out from.
Those four coins I mentioned have a chance because
- ETH is a different concept with it's own intrinsic value regarding the turing-complete computing power it provides. Although the lack of a fixed coin cap means it's more susceptible to inflation. There are various ways this could resolve, but right now there's no known answer. ETH already has over 4x as many coins in circulation as BTC will ever have, which means it would have to capture 4x the total crypto market cap before an individual coin was worth more than BTC. That said, it doesn't directly compete with BTC because of the DAPP feature.
- ZEC, DASH, and XMR because they offer anonymity and faster block times, making them potentially good replacement for the "cash" side of BTC. DASH has a further feature that the development of the coin is directly paid for by 10% of the block reward: that means that as long as DASH has value, it will pay to develop itself: although I'll leave it to you to decide if that's an advantage or disadvantage.
ETH does have competitors, but currently has a fairly large lead in the DAPP world, so I think it will enjoy the bulk of that sector's profitability.
ZEC/DASH/XMR are riskier investment propositions, because they compete with each other I suspect only one of them will truly succeed. Any one of them could surpass BTC's market value or coin value if widely adopted. Their biggest problem, other than competing with each other, is that they may be seen as the "cash" to BTC's "gold". Eg BTC will be very valuable as a store of wealth, while ZEC/DASH/XMR will be used as currency with fast transfers. Eg you convert BTC to one of these cash coins, spend it, the recipient converts it back to BTC. The value stays low, and the utility is in fast, transfers and/or privacy.
These are the main 4 that I believe currently have potential. Some other coins have good levels of usefulness too, eg SIA, but they have a vested interest in having a relatively stable value compared to fiat. While I think they have good market cap potential, they don't have great individual coin value potential (eg investing now).
You'll probably notice that the above is absolutely chock-full of caveats and "maybe" and "if", because nobody can predict the future: we can only apply our own opinions and make a guess. The above is my guess for the current most likely candidates to surpass BTC in either market cap or individual coin value, although I suspect BTC will remain the most valuable individual coin for at least the medium term.

My total tax rate is within a few percent of what I'd pay in the US on an equivalent (roughly average in each country) salary. Once you include healthcare, I actually pay less here than I would in the US
More children are murdered in the US than Europe. Significantly more, in fact. Rape rates are about the same.

Why can't an exchange follow both forms?
At least one exchange is applying new designations (BTS and BCC, I believe) to the two forks, and taking a neutral stance

The point being that it's still a fork, and should be called a fork.

No nerves struck, it was an interesting avenue to take the discussion down :)

16 million BTC. But BTC is currently divisible down to 8 decimal places (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC)
That means there are actually 1,600,000,000,000,000 satoshis in circulation
This isn't a fixed limit, though - if it ever got to the point that 1 satoshi was $300 and we were buying a car with 100 satoshis or something, we could add more decimals to make it manageable and more divisible
But there's nothing to say we have to give a shit about the number of decimals: they only exist to allow the currency to be shared according to the number of users. We could easily re-adjust it so that what was 1 sat (0.00000001 BTC) is now called 1 Satcoin, and you'd now price that car as 100 Sat.
Like if USD tomorrow became 100x more valuable, you could start pricing things in cents and add a new coin underneath to divide the cent into change.
The actual names/decimals used don't matter, they exist only to make sure we're always using consistent numbers.

That doesn't contradict me? That article actually suggests August 1st BTCSW + BCC values together may be less than the current BTC price, not that they have to be the same as the pre-split BTC value

In terms of bandwidth, a full node of 8MB blocks would be 34GB/month.
My $7 VPS server could therefore download 5 years of history per month (plus this month's data). And you can probably find a 2TB/mo server for $5, I just need more RAM.
And that's right now - an actual requirement for 8MB blocks is years away. But let's assume that Bitcoin had been running 8MB blocks from launch in 2009, and we're starting a new node today. So let's find a server with plenty of bandwidth.
12TB Bandwidth would be &lt;$100 month right now. 12 TB would be enough to download 29 years worth of 8MB blockchain (plus enough to spare to download the existing 100GB blockchain we have today). Well, that's blatantly overkill.
We'd actually only need 8 years worth of bandwidth, or just over 3TB of data. A 4TB data vps is something like $30 per month, and would give you enough data for about a decade worth of 8MB block history.
And, of course, you'd only need to pay that for one month, after which you can downscale to a $5 server again.
Or if you want to start running a node now with 8MB blocks, you could use that $5 server and download the current blockchain history, and still have enough 56.5x more bandwidth left than you need this month for your 8MB blocks.
**TL;DR: How much would it cost to run a node? Not enough to give a shit** I already have a server capable of running one, and I used more bandwidth last month downloading steam games.

Karbon looks like a massively over-ambitious "DotCom bubble" type of "me too" ICO. And the 24 hour sales absolutely reflect this: they've raised something like $4000 so far.
Ethereum has a good chance of beating BTC's market cap, but a very low chance of beating BTC's single coin value because ETH has no 21m coin cap: it currently has something like 90m coins in circulation, compared to BTC's 16m.
Why do you consider ZEC/DASH/XMR not to have value?

That isn't a thing
Either demand will be high and BCH will sustain a value, or it will immediately crash as people look to sell while there's still some speculative value
The idea that people are going to avoid a guaranteed quick buck and somehow mislead buyers into slowly trickling funds to them at a higher price is total nonsense: If you try this and are right about BCH having no value, then you're just going to find that someone else sells first and you're left holding value-less BCH
OF course, that assumes you're right

There's nothing to stop them creating a wallet and transferring your balance to it, though, at your own risk.
That said, I don't see why there's any real need for this: it's functionally equivalent to simply withdrawing your BTC.

Demand of Fiat in Venezuela is presumably proportional to the supply. Demand of BTC worldwide, though, can vary wildly.
