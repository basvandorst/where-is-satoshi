Technically the public private keys can be identical. You could have BTC LTC and DOGE stored on the same public key but on three different blockchains.

He won't actually be doing this, instead he will be forking the chain, and until the core devs make a decision. 
By the way - the chain gets forked everyday - it just ends up following the longest chain. Any one of those forks could be mined further if someone decided that's what they wanted to do.

The point is that even with large debt, a default sets a precident of not having to pay the debt. So in effect they get out of the debt by defaulting.
The consequence is that going forward they will not be able to borrow anymore, and that would normally cause liquidity issues. Not having liquidity, means social unrest, and everything that follows.
However using something like Bitcoin or litecoin or Dogecoin gives them immediate liquidity - completely out of reach of the central banks, who are playing the liquidity game, and if they declared this use, the price would skyrocket - allowing them to pay their creditors anyway.
I don't know why Varoufakis hasn't realised this sooner. Unfortunately if I had to pick one coin it would not be Bitcoin though, because the potential gains in litecoin for example are orders of magnitude higher than Bitcoin.

And that my friend is the analogy which is useful when trying to explain why Bitcoin is both a revolution and important for the future. You don't have to get into all the convoluted discussions about private keys and such like. It's just an analogy that most people can understand easily.

I think what is happening is that the word "BlockChain" will be increasingly used as a euphemism for Bitcoin. It lets people talk about "it" without having to deal with the controversial aspects. It doesn't mean they are ignoring or not using Bitcoin, it's just that they now have the freedom to express themselves without controversy. 
That is frustrating to nerds like us, but it is a welcome development, especially as we all know, you cannot have BlockChain integrity without the coin reward mechanism.

Ok I don't buy this at all. 
What is true however is that almost all lending to countries is made by private organizations and pension funds - the bond market as it is known. Lenders were secure because countries control tax, austerity and the printing of money, which meant there was always a mechanism in place to get their money back. It was always seen as a sure bet, and very very lucrative.
When the Euro was introduced this mechanism was ended. It was done on purpose BECUASE that mechanism is fundamentally evil and ultimately ends in countries using tax money to pay debts and not pay teachers for example.
Currently there is no such thing as a Eurobond, meaning these private organizations cannot directly lend to the Euro region.
They continued to lend to individual countries in Europe, but with no direct guarantees as they had before because individual countries cannot issue currency, or print money. They can however introduce austerity. As austerity puts direct and political pressure on governments to accept lenders terms or face social unrest. Greece is a textbook example.
But if you regularly read the Economist or other such Financial industry papers you will see that they are lobbying hard for the creation of a Eurobond, an Germany is point blank refusing, which as much as the Germans are made out to be bad guys, is IMHO the right thing to do by the people.
Given that Eurobonds do not exits and that there is no guarantee for financial debts, the agenda has to be a return to the good old days, and that is the underlying reason why Cyprus happened, why Greece is happening and earlier, why UK left the ERM (exchange rate mechanism precursor to the Euro). The lenders who are mainly UK and US based do not want the Euro and are using the markets and Austerity as their weapons.

I am in Brussels - the sentiment from people in the commission was that the IMF have been unreasonable at every turn. I hesitated to post that information before because it is hearsay, however today's various media reporting says exactly that. 
Strangely this also supports Varoufakis who said two weeks ago that the "deal" presented to them "was the kind of deal you propose if you don't want a deal".
I'm speculating if I conclude that the IMF may have an agenda to screw the Euro, and that would be the way to do it. If you simply refuse every effort by another party to compromise you kill them, especially if you hold the purse strings.

Contrary to all the comments here, running a full node can be incentivized. 
All point of sale systems run a back end of some kind, you can think of a full node run by a shop as a back end POS for Bitcoin, and on that basis the shop can include a small fee with each transaction they process at the point of payment.
This gives the shop owner an incentive over and above zero fees and better profitability. I would not care about paying another near zero fee into a brick and mortar transaction for the good of the network.

OK I'll give you my view too, because I think the stack exchange answers didn't see the bigger picture.
This is going to be a little bit technical.
Every Bitcoin transaction is a small signed message. 
All that is required is to be able to send that message to the bitcoin network.
It does not necessarilly have to be to a Bitcoin node in china.
It does not necessarily have to be transmitted by internet protocol. It could be by email.
You could email a signed transaction from china to somewhere else and the recipient could transmit it for you.
I'm not going through the options on how many different ways there are for getting transactions out of china, but China only controls china, and if you can send a string of text anywhere you have a chance of getting your transaction made.  
The point is **you cannot prevent transactions from propagating**

I think you miss the point completely. Taxes are only due when you declare them - and in some countries you are not even obliged to declare gains as I have said elsewhere. 
Given the undeniable complexity in linking a human identity to a specific bitcoin address (try doing that with a cold wallet), and then proving that a person has possession of the keys to that address is a whole different story. But it is this story which is the important one, not the law or the idea that you must pay taxes. 
In fact many people don't pay taxes at all - mainly the rich who hide all their wealth in offshore accounts, but nobody seems to be making a point of forcing them to be honest - so why a couple of million bitcoiners with a few cents in bitcoin?
If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for us too. Now we have the power to do it, let the govt fugure out how to crack it.

This discussion is all the same as the PC/Mac stuff used to be : two sides with different views. In the end it doesn't really matter, something will happen that will make these polemics irrelevant. 
Probably the vast majority of people in the west where life is comfortable do not see the added value from what they already have. I can't argue with that.
But if I was in a country or region that consistently debased my money year after year, or already provided very strict currency controls, then crypto currencies are orders of magnitude better. Those consumers are already dealing with cash very often, simply to survive. If Bitcoin can help them (and by the way they are the majority of the planet) then it undoubtedly will change things in our comfortable western bubble-wrapped lives.

Actually this is not anything to do with quantum computing.
It is about the way in which you expose the private key. For example if you have the private key stored on paper (encrypted or not) you will generally need to load it onto an online device to make a transaction. Once this happens you can assume that the private key has been compromised - if not now, but potentially in the future therefore moving all your remaining coins to another cold storage address reduces the risk to zero.
On a side note it is possible to make a transaction on an offline device - armory wallet allows you to do this but it is technical, an still the private key has been exposed.

A wallet is a container, that holds addresses.
You can have one or many addresses in your wallet.
People say that an address is like a bank account number of sorts, and your case this would be a good analogy. However it can get more complcated than this.
It is the address that you will post on your blog, or indeed the QR code. 
The address is long and complcated, unless you copy and paste it correctly you could find that your donations are just disappearing to an incorrect address, and in all probability, lost forever.
The wallet performs another task, it allows you to spend the coins that you have.
I like using Multibit alot. It is a "lightweight client" as they are known suitable for beginners. Create a wallet, which automatically creates one address. You can name the wallet "Donations". You can create more addresses but this becomes much more complcated to use, so just stick with the basics.
When someone sends you a donation, it will just magically appear in your wallet and you will be able to see the transactions on the trabnsactions tab.
Each wallet is always up-to-date as long as it is connected to the internet.
As you are new, I would recommend creating a backup. Again Multibit guides you through the process.

Whoa there! Mining in your context (PoS) is completely irrelevant.
Just to give you an idea :
When I pay you, in fact I am not paying you.
What I am doing is signing something which gets recorded into a public ledger. Nothing more than that.
In fact you don't even have to be notified that I have done that.
By design a bitcoin client will receive the information that a new ledger entry has been made but that is not a necessary part of the process. Indeed you don't even need to have a client to check that this has occured - you can do it on the web.
Mining as such has nothing really to do with that process. Mining is about making sure that the ledger is consistent. My transaction will get included in a block (it gets "confirmed") at some point from seconds after the transaction got relayed (if I'm lucky) to 10 minutes later or if I'm really unlucky later. 
But in any case it is a pretty difficult thing to acheive a double spend once a transaction has reached all nodes - which btw happens in under 3 seconds.  
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:41:47

@_date: 2014-03-28 11:12:26
But that has nothing to do with bitcoin - that is an accounting practice, and I have nothing against that. 
Bitcoin can be accounted for in exactly the same way any merchant would deal with cash, the protocol does not have to change or be adapted in anyway. In fact Coinkite, and Coinbase and Bitpay all provide that information, without anyone having to change Bitcoin.

Firstly, try to get your head around inputs and outputs (I don't really see that in your diagram) 
Secondly, transactions aren't directly broadcast. They are advertised (by your client broadcasting its inventory) and if another node wants to it requests a transaction or a block from your node/client it does so. Of course this wouldn't work if nodes weren't interested, but they are and that's how it works.
Construction of a transaction is complex and variable. The bitcoin client attempts to optimise a lot of things including which unspent outputs to choose as inputs to the transaction. It's not a first-come first-served basis for selection. And only then are signatures made.
I could go on....

Debt needs to be serviced - first of all taxes are used and when that is not enough, then more debt is used. Nobody is suggesting that this is ever a sustainable model.
When one or two countries go through this there is a substantial price to pay, think Argentina Greece Cyprus and yes Japan.
But the fact that the major players in the world are nearing that point has never been experienced by the world as yet. When all of the major players are there ( and this is not open to doubt, it will happen soon) then the world will have a crisis like nothing before. That's what always happens when debt exceeds GDP

This is a simple mistake from noobs. A confirmation is not the same as accepting a payment. 
A confirmation is given, when a payment is included in a block. Prior to that the transaction is sent to the network within milliseconds.
The merchant receives the payment in milliseconds, and it is up to the merchant to accept zero confirmations as proof of payment or not.
Is there a risk?
In reality zero confirmations are fine. The merchant is basically saying "is the person paying me capable of issuing a double-spend and broadcast it to the network faster than they are able to pay me". The maths of this mean that it cannot be done if the merchant is running their own bitcoin node (because they would be aware of the double spend at the point you attempt to do it).
So to answer your question you can have your product.

How exactly are they doing that? They can't unless they own the private key to sign the transaction. In which case you are not the owner of the bitcoins, but Xapo are. That's my point: it's bs.

It accomplishes the task perfectly - you can't argue with the maths. 
A file that cannot be read or listened to by anyone without the owner's permission to do so. It doesn't matter that the file in its encryted form can be copied millions of times - the point of the art is that you need to be able to see it or hear it. 
What don't you understand about that? Not being able to see or hear the file would be utterly pointless. 
I said I agree that an owner can choose to allow the digital file into the public domain, by making or allowing copies of an unencrypted version, the financial consequence is obvious but that would be their choice and nobody elses.
This is exactly how the (non-digital) art world works and it would be no different for an encrypted digital piece.

Most of what you suggest is the convenience versus control argument. It is convenient to have one click payments, but you have given away control of your money in order to do this.
I get the convenience argument and there will be companies that offer what you say, *for a price*, but you have to remember that's what banking is, and all that ends up being, once you give control to someone else.

Using that logic, you could also say that going to work for a company as an employee is a gamble, because you have no control over the future of the company or sufficient power to change its direction if you think it is not moving in the right one, and ultimately because of this the company could fold tomorrow having spent it's earnings unwisely.
You can just turn everything into a gamble if you make the argument for it, but that's just the whole of life's experience.
Then there is working voluntarily for something you believe in, without risking your future is not a gamble. It could be considered a waste of time, but it's not a gamble.

What you are suggesting is not directly possible, but also I'm not sure what your intention would be, also different countries have different succession rules so sometimes what you intend as your legacy may not be legally possible.
If it is to make your entire will and its contents a public document, then simply post it on any forum or blog post is sufficient.
If your intention is to prove that you made the will you do not need to post it anywhere, but you can use a bitcoin client to cryptographically sign the text of the document with a private key that only you own, and that will go with you to the grave.
Take that signature and print it out along with the document and the public key.
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:25:19
What are you talking about? You can't insert something into the blockchain in the past. 
But you can insert it into the blockchain the moment you take the picture, thereby creating a permanent record of both the picture and the data locked in time.
Imagine you take a picture of a UFO, and your camera hashes the image and the EXIF information to a 40byte hash. You make a transaction and include the hash in OP_RETURN. Now you have a permanent proof that both the image and the EXIF data has not been tampered with.
This has nothing to do with signing the picture (which the OP originally postulated would work, and which I say cold not work because it is not the signature that locks the information, it's the fact of there being a transaction).

I don't care about debating - but I do care about "sitting back", which is IMHO complacent.
Bitcoin has got a very long way to go, and it still needs the infrastructure to be there to make it happen. Of course it won't stop people trying it once, which contributes to adoption figures, but we need them to do it again and again, and in the long term that won't happen if we all sit around waiting for it.
A good example of this is litecoin, which in my view has no devs at all. Where would Bitcoin be without BitcoinJ? Somewhere like where litecoin is now.

There is no current standard for building payment services of the back of bitcoin on the Web. Indeed it requires a lot of care when dealing with the architecture in order to avoid the kind of hacks that exploit insecure websites.
That's why the person earlier suggested using existing services. 
You need to know:
How to set up a node
Where to set up your node
How to talk to it securely
How to define your private keys and where to keep them
How to create your public key (address hashes) on the fly
How to check that a payment has been made and what criteria before it is considered accepted
How to stop DoSes on your site (you will get a lot of this)
Much much more...
I'm not saying it can't be done, of course it can, but you sound like a beginner, and I would give it 6 months before you start to understand the risks involved (we are talking about your site becoming its own bank) and how to deal with those risks.

It's not about the convenience. There is a far bigger picture to do with the way in which governments manage the economies. 
Recent laws have come into place that allow banks to simply take your money without warning you in advance, and the reason that they are being given this power, is that the countries no longer have the ability to pay their debts to banks.
Are we entering a time when the banks will need to use those powers? We already have. Cyprus, Belgium, Spain have all done exactly that in the last 12 months. Do you want convenience at the risk of losing everything?

Yes bizarrely when the price was sky high people just sent me money asking for me to buy on the exchanges so that they didn't have to register. BTC and LTC.
The craziest thing was that it all happened so quick that it took me a while to realise I should have kept meticulous accounting records, and even more time to do that retrospectively. I still hold a small amount for my dad and another friend, but I realise this is pretty dangerous, and I need to do something about cold storage.

This is easy and hard. Normally Bob first publishes his public key in a public forum like on his website or in a blog, twitter, Facebook post or whatever. In effect he is letting the world know of his public key before anybody needs to use it. 
The main issue with this is that there is no standard for publishing it and anyone can publish a key claiming to be you. Gavin Andresen has recently been impersonated by someone publishing a fake public key claiming to be GA and it was believed that the intention was to substitute a fake Bitcoin software signed by the fake GA keys. We can only speculate why.
Interestingly there was a discussion on the Bitcoin devs list recently about a potential solution using a distributed ledger of sorts to solve exactly this problem. I believe it was from the Meek team.

The point of Bitcoin is that you are the only one who can sign a transaction. You can't let someone else have permission to automatically sign your transactions otherwise they will just empty your account. This includes your wallet. You don't ever want to automate that!!!

This is not strictly true. Bitcoin offers you the possibility to cryptographically sign contracts, which means that you cannot deny agreement.
One side-effect of this is that honesty will have to become the norm. If you absolutely do not agree with all the terms, you absolutely won't have to cryptographically sign. This gives an incentive to the business or other party to either negotiate or play fair, or lose everyone's business. Right now they don't have to play fair and it becomes a costly exercise to defend your rights. Bitcoin will change that.

What a crock of shit. Whenever I read or hear "it's to protect you", I know that it is the exact opposite.
It is to protect their business model, which is to actually be the custodians of your bitcoins on the premise that it is for security reasons. 
I doubt very much that for every withdrawal request they will ask you to send a photograph with today's newspaper and the original ID, and that someone at Circle will manually verify this - which is by the way completely shoppable.

I think you should speak to the people that do this in the west - forget about how difficult it is elsewhere. The problem is not collecting the taxes, it is knowing what taxes are due. That's not due to avoidance, or plain non-declaration, but it is in fact due to the complexity of the rules, and the difficulty the authorities have in policing this. 
You can pick any western country and ask the right questions, and you get some quite scary answers back. The bottom line is that even the tax authorities freely admit that they have lost control of the whole system.

Holy shit now I get what they are doing, and IMHO it's fucking dangerous.
So you transfer all your bitcoins to them, and set up a bank-like account with all your cards.
They take your bitcoins and just exchange it for "a token", and if you want more bitcoins they take your cash and then credit more "token BTC" to your Circle wallet.

You should also say exactly what $1 can buy today. For example use the classic Mars bar test. How much of a Mars bar can you buy for $1?
Also do comparisons with larger priced items like a house. Work out what area (in square metres) $1 will buy you today. So even though the price of a house goes up the amount of space you can buy for that dollar is actually less and less.
And do the same for Bitcoin.

That is 1 bitcoin according to breadwallet.
You see the problem is that greed is being used to define the unit rather than anything else.
The definition of the unit is not what is holding Bitcoin back. It's the fact that it is far too complex for merchants in bricks and mortar stores to accept.
Try this... Go into a medium size store, try to get hold of the owner, try to set up 10+ payment terminals linked to his / her already antiquated POS. Now you have to contact his accountant and start to explain how Bitcoin is perfectly acceptable except that there is no GAAP, so the accountant will have to make up his own rules, and provided that you have been able to convince both the owner and his accountant and you have dealt with the technicalities of reconciling all the payments between the POS and the BlockChain, and you will immediately see what is holding Bitcoin back. 
All this talk of units is a waste of time. We should all be focussing on what I just described.

But I think you are completely underestimating how much trust is placed in banks now, and what the risks are if they go wrong. This absolutely dwarfs any risk that Bitcoin poses even if a company just says it is accepting Bitcoin. 
There are two ways to look at this: 1) a company that  integrates Bitcoin is spreading the risk and opening up to better margins.
2) a company that doesn't integrate Bitcoin is placing all it's eggs in the current financial system - most of which will come to a sticky end if governments continue to borrow as they are now, and the economies to not turn around. Actually I'll lay my hat on that happening in 2019.

This is FUD. If your phone gets hacked, you have more risk with a bank auto-payment device like this because the bank will simply deny any responsibility when your money starts disappearing. The fact that you have a limit is tantamount to admission that it can be done.
On the other hand Bitcoin is fully recoverable, because your bitcoins can only be moved if you have actually signed for them using your private key which is not stored on the device when you have an HD wallet and the like, and they are not stored on your device but on the blockchain.

France has always had a problem with a black market. They simply think that with the current system it doesn't exist. It is more likely that they can plausibly deny that it exists "because of current regulation" in front of the european union.
One example of how the french missed the point is in house sales. Everything has to pass by a lawyer, but in the past the lawyer used to leave the room whilst large bags of cash were exchanged. Therefore the french "banned" cash payments for houses.
Of course, the practice still goes on, you just do it differently ie not at the offices of the lawyer any more.
So ask yourself - is this stuff actually workable. The answer is no. I can think of several workarounds already (cash payments for bitcoin for example, bitcoins transferred using multi-sig under the noses of a lawyer for example.
All that the french are doing is providing ways for people to think about how to work around the system, which is good for bitcoin, and bad news in the longrun for the french government.

Mister Cash or Bancontact, is the MAJOR payment method used by all banks in Belgium. It trumps credit card payments by a very long way, and everyone in the European Institutions who live and work in Brussels will know of this.
Is this good news for Bitcoin? I don't know, but I can say that at least people will get used to the idea of making payments with a QR code much faster and that is a good thing.

Because NFC is non directional and has no id mechanism indeed all radio reception is based on "strongest signal" that means a malicious actor standing next to you with a powerful transmitter can simply hijack the signal. You won't know something has gone wrong until much later.
Imagine this, you receive the message, you sign and the cash desk says "have you signed yet" you reply "yes" but they say "it doesn't appear to have worked, do it again" by which time your attacker is long gone with you first fully authorized transaction.

I chose my words carefully - I did not say that they need to understand anything. But with every product the user has to understand the USE CASE. Otherwise they simply don't use it.
The message about the use case for Bitcoin is very muddled at the moment. There are of course many many use cases, but the man in the street for example has no idea why they would ever need a smart contract. 
Therefore it is obscure. The man in the street needs a specific and common use case, that they can relate to.

That's not how it works. Firstly bill of materials comprise multiple materials from multiple sources and in the case of retail or restaurants these are extremely complex, indeed sometimes you cannot directly trace a product sold to a purchase order.
For example a supermarket receives a whole cow. It chops it up and attempts to sell the fresh meat. Failing that the meat gets re-packed with other unsold meat from another cow. If that doesn't get sold it gets minced. Then if that doesn't sell the cook mixes it with pork and a tomato sauce (which includes partial onions partial tomatoes partial oregano and water) and is made into a spaghetti sauce. Get it now? This is the practical issue that won't be solved by your solution, and by the way the accounting part happens after the sale, and this is loses any of the details I mentioned above.
Accounting, only sees the outstanding on both sides. It does not see the detail of what makes up those sides. I have worked in many companies that try to extract what you think is possible after the fact and never have I seen it work.

You love the idea behind bitcoin.... but you don't seem to understand that the idea is that you cannot trust other parties to hold your money.
In the original white paper it is explained that this trust in third parties *is* the problem that bitcoin solves. (Amongst other things of course)
Maybe your grandma won't get it, and not surprising too they have been conditioned, nay, indoctrinated into the way of thinking that you call "simplified".
I'm not saying that there doesn't need to be developments, what I al saying is that it goes hand in hand with doing things in a better way, less open to corruption.

There is nothing to say that your own bank is operating on a fractional reserve either, but the method is the same. A bank will want to have all your assets under their control - banks also claim that they offer insured deposits. 
This is a simple case of being able to offer insurance because they pay out of other people's deposits. Ie the chances of a theft on all wallets must be considered very low, so they could easily pay one claim from funds which are under their control. This is exactly the same model as banks use now.
Indeed, once you give all your coins to them, there is no telling what they might do to "invest" (read gamble) them. 
The WHOLE POINT of Bitcoin was that YOU control your coins. The whole point of traditional banking was that they control your money, and once they did that it was far too tempting to go all fractional reserve on you. The whole point of circle is that it wants to control you money. Do you see now?

You cannot sign a transaction without knowing where the transaction is going and for how much. Therefore I do not see how you think you can "pre-process" a transaction.
Getting the UTXOs is a problem, because if you do not keep your device up-to-date you have no idea if your transaction was confirmed or not, and in the case that it wasn't you would not be able to re-use the UTXO. This becomes a complicated mess and you will need to have a seperate trusted UTXO tracking mechanism on the device.

Bitcoin is technical and complex, and there is no getting round that - all bitcoin businesses have to have a level of expertise for them to work.
I met Danny in Amsterdam last year. He opened the conference, but I found it very strange that he could not answer even some basic technical questions from the audience with any credibility. 
I didn't invest from gut feeling, and I was amazed how quickly they were able to get support and their image and brand accepted here.
I think a good test for any of the businesses that launch here is does their leader know what the hell he or she is talking about? Can they explain bitcoin technology in plain language  - that's always the test of someone who knows the subject.
After that, can they pull the project off - well that's either gut feeling or experience, but if they fall over because they don't know the tech - forget it.

Luckily this rather depends on what country you live in. 
There is a little country in Europe where the tax man says that if you have gains on any commodity, you don't even need to put it down on your tax return, unless you actually declare that you are a day trader as a hobby or profession. The tax office doesn't even want tio know that you may have gained, and you can legitilately put the funds on your account, buy a house, a car whatever you want. 
I know this sounds crazy, it sounds unreal and illogical, but this is actually the law, and many many rich people move to this country simply to make use of this law when they expecxt huge capital gains, from selling businesses and other stuff. The country is Belgium.

The whole purpose of a BlockChain is accounting accuracy. A company using a chain of interconnected events (stock movements, goods receipts, GL account posting and more) would undoubtedly be revolutionary in any business reporting. But it does not necessarily *require* either mining or Bitcoin - these would be completely surplus to the aim of the mechanism. A ledger works perfectly well today in every company.

So what is the advantage? How does a user know that they have received a payment request from the shop an not someone standing next to them? 
NFC as far as I know does not contain ID info and can be locally intercepted. If it is just transmitting the http address (as in BIP70) then NFC is a hugely unsafe protocol to do this. I could be standing next to you and transmit my own Signal and your device has no way of knowing that it is not the shops signal.
That's basically why QR is better because the person taking the image knows what they are pointing at and it eliminates local hacking esp if the QR is on a till receipt.

All that proves is that the message was signed with a wallet containing some funds - that is not sufficient proof IMHO. The very most that this could show is that there are sufficient funds in that specific wallet to cover the demands of the individuals, it does not say if there is sufficient funds to cover all the individuals involved.
The point is to have the specific funds seperately visible for the 4-5 people he says he's holding them for, and watch them get collected, or not as the case may be. At least then everyone will know if he is speaking the truth or not.

There is no such thing as a centralised blockchain. The blockchain is a ledger with special properties that *require* mining to secure the state of the ledger across a decentralised network. 
A ledger that is centralised is your bank, meaning it is open to abuse, one transaction does not have to be linked to anything else.
The blockchain is the revolutionary step.

The presumption in your question is that there will continue to be loans, but you have to understand that loans are only the answer to the question of inflation.
Your house price appears to go up in value (compared to what you paid for it in absolute $ terms), but ask yourself why the price is increasing? Is it because you are paying so much interest that when you eventually sell the house, you at least want to have the feeling that you made some money from the sale? Or is it because inflation is causing all prices to appear to rise relative to the price paid in absolute terms? Or is it a combination of both?
The question you should be asking is not how bitcoin would cope, but rather if you remove inflation, and you remove loan interest what would market price really be, and would it rise at all?
Removing loan interest is simply because there are no possibility of "loans" simply because you cannot invent Bitcoins. If the bank does not have the bitcoins to lend you then it cannot make a loan to you, and even then there is absolutely no guarantee that they could ever get their money back, neither would it be possible to seize your house and property, because simply those would be on a blockchain somewhere too.
So given that there were no redress for a bank or other organisation to give you the money, there would be no loans. Look how even today, the banks refuse to give home loans even though in the UK for example, they are bound by law to fulfill a certain amount per year.
Banks would reject anything which to them would be a high-risk with no means of recovery. A bitcoin loan would be just that.
The result would be a re-adjustment of all house prices, to a level where people could afford to buy a house from savings alone.
Therefore the elephant in the room with bitcoin is the massive re-adjustment of values of everything. Those who hold bitcoin today will be fine, those who don't and continue to refuse to will probably end up with a big headache.

You have to trust a custodian. That is the problem right there. As for your "sigh" it shows that actually you don't get why this problem is a problem. Let me just put you straight: it's called temptation. There is no way in the world to stop any custodial business from being tempted to do anything I describe, and in time, as we have learned from bankers, custody is in their eyes ownership. Regulators cannot stop the abuses they have done, so let's just say we should avoid going down that path with Xapo shall we?

The ripple network basically allows them to make cross continent currency payments without going through the traditional banking network. For example if you are trading in dollars but want to withdraw to euros it would normally take up to a week to transfer the money from a dollar account via the various international payment processors to your bank. 
With ripple they only need to find a ripple gateway that has enough euros to cover the payment. Bitstamp issues an IOU to the euro gateway and the euro gateway pays you. Effectively Bitstamp made the conversion from dollars to euros instantly and because the payment is now to be made from inside the euro zone the cash arrives far faster on your account with less charges.

Apart from not understanding that Bitcoin is both a commodity and a unit of exchange, you completely missed the point.

As the market grew, so did the price stabilise - that how markets work.  I'm ok using bitcoin now, just like the early pioneers of the last century. If you only looked at the market price you would dismiss the obvious.

This is exactly the problem the BlockChain was designed to resolve. Ie the idea that property can be assigned without requiring a trusted third party.

If you understand Bitcoin, what you have is a piece of the internet of money. Now imagine if there had been an equivalent piece of the actual internet back then.

No. The specific issue was that bread issued a message stating that the word "sway" was not in the list of words. 
I think people are getting two things mixed up. A deterministic wallet is subtly different that a hierarchical deterministic wallet.
Deterministic means you can recreate a seed from which a single private key can be made.
HD wallets go one step further creating an extended private key from a deterministic seed which you can create trees of public and private keys.
The root problem here is in the compatibility of the seed recreation process.

I am guessing you are a noob, but I'll give you a pointer: find out exactly where the banks get their money from to pay interest - don't just assume that it appears magically, or that it comes from banks "making your money work".
Also one thing you should be aware of is that Banks will never pay you interest at a rate that is greater than the actual inflation rate. Which means that any money you invest in a savings account - even if it appears to earn interest - will always be reducing in value because of the effects of inflation.
The government published inflation rates do not use inflationary figures from every industry sector, instead they cherry pick the ones that will give them the lowest amount of inflation as a measure.
Just be warned, as soon as you start to learn about these mechanisms, you will quickly realise that holding your own wallet, and being your own bitcoin bank is the most effective thing to do to protect yourself against inflation.

BTC-e used to have a much higher volume, but they went through a bad patch where they simply kept blocking people's accounts, and not repsonding to support message. There was a suspicion they were running fractional reserve, but considering the volume now, I doubt if they even need to try. They made a bucket load in the early days.
Deposits with Fiat cost a whopping 100 euros on top of bank charges, just to go through their russian banking partner, and I think this was just too much for most people.
It's actually a real shame, because I honestly think they could have been easily the biggest (non-chinese) exchange by now, and their interface although ugly, is very easy to understand.

Bitcoin is the biggest hacking prize in history. Every minute of every day for the last 5+ years the best minds in the world have tried to hack Bitcoin. It is going on right now. Don't think for one minute that this is some way off in the future. It is now.
So are your arguments founded?
Your argument seems to stem from some assumptions about what would be acceptable for an individual, but this is in contrast with your insistence that you are talking about big business. Let me give you a few examples about how big business works:
Business to business has a better case for bitcoin than individuals, because - if you have ever worked inside a large organisation - you will understand that bean counting is difficult, and moreso when you have multiple currencies and terrible software (I'm looking at you SAP). A blockchain literally solves this problem overnight and in one currency. 
Imagine each cost-centre and profit-centre and GL account had a unique bitcoin address... an entire and completely outdated industry is destroyed overnight and replaced with a blockchain. That's why big business will embrace bitcoin.
Let me give you another example: Company currencies? Ever heard of that? Yes all companies operate a company currency for reporting, that means if they designate the Norwegian krona as the company currency, then they don't care about the Euro even if all their sales are in Euro. What they care about is the bottom line reported in Norweigian krona.
Also big businesses are far more interested in price fluctuations than you know.
Now all you have to do is substitute the words Norweigian krona for Bitcoin. Same problem, far better solution. Big businesses actually love a currency when it goes down because they do "swapping" and they make literally huge amounts of money like that - *when a currency goes down in value*. I know because I worked on such a system for a medium sized company.
On the other hand when the price goes up, if you hold you win. So big businesses absolutely love volatility - it's not a bad thing for them. Whole departments are dedicated to making this kind of money.
On the 51% attack you haven't even considered the economics of doing it - that's all that counts. Finding the next block is 10 minutes away, meaning you have ten minutes to win 25 bitcoins (oooh not exactly big money) - but even then there is no guarantee that you can stay ahead of the competition or that you will find the next block - that's the problem. How much computing power and energy is required to consistently win 25 bitcoins again and again and again? Isn't it cheaper to just *buy* them? Of course it is, and that's the point. Let's not forget that the moment a 51% attack is discovered, the price hits the floor, so what was all that effort for? No miner would ever risk the value of what they are mining for just to be part of a 51% pool. That is just stupidity.
Lastly you make a whole thing about trust. Bitcoin is trustless, it is designed to be, there are markers in the blockchain to avoid 51% attacks, there are ways in which Michael Dell has protected his bitcoin from hackers - it's all there. You just have to look for the information. 
My answers are pointers as to where to look.

BItcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. If Bitcoin ever has a value like you say, it will be because the Dollar has collapsed. In which case $1M dollars will be worth very little.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:14:10
The stupid comment means that if you wanted to do everything you suggested and have total freedom to do whatever they wanted in terms of issuance, then they would have to be stupid not to realise that this means starting their own alt-coin.
The concepts you mix up is the current market value of Bitcoin, and the "assigned" value of your 100 million satoshis.
Lets say you buy one BTC for $650. How do you then divide $650 by 100 mil and end up with a valuation of $10 per satoshi. Or to put is another way, the person receiving a payment of your micro transactions has no way of acheiving the sale value at $10 per satoshi.
No matter what arbitrary value you assign to the fragments of bitcoin, it still has to mean something when someone wants to convert to fiat currency. Therefore you have probably mixed up the importance of a market value that is more-or-less the same for each unit.

Contrary to what others are saying here, yes you can do something that would ensure a kind of singularity of a piece of digital art.
This is how I would do it:
1 create my piece of art and encrypt it with my public key.
2 this would ensure that only I could actually see the piece of art and nobody else.
3 Although the encrypted file itself could be copied nobody else could decrypt it and therefore could not see or hear the file.
4 if I wished to pass the art to someone else I would simply decrypt it and then re encrypt it using another person's public key
5 unless I kept a copy of the unencrypted version - which incidentally would render both my version and the new owners version worthless, I would no longer be able to enjoy the piece of art. Ie the unencrypted version must be destroyed at some point.
I could imagine that sometime in the future a block-chain will be created that will do exactly this.

Of course there is credit card fraud simply because that option is open to them. Imagine a bitcoin world without chargebacks, where the criminals HAVE to spend the money, and you see it disappear overnight.
But I also see the other side of the argument. What protection is there for the consumer? Well simply that's where multi sig comes in. Imagine the carrier(UPS DHL etc) being one of the mutli-sigs on the transaction. They simply sign the bitcoins over when the goods are delivered. It could even be programmed into one of their portable signing devices.
Or how about multiple payments and pay to scripts?
This is how it will be done in the future, consulers will get BETTER protection than they have today. That's the real point.

I did not say that your words were propoganda. What we have to remember (as it is so easily forgotten) is that the start of this crisis was the rejection by the Ukranian government of a supposed "peaceful" EU trade agreement, that also happened to contain an agreement that the Ukranian military should fall under direct control of NATO.
I'm not surprised the Ukranian government rejected it, but somehow the media has managed to skip that bit in their reporting, because they want to make out that Putin is bad. He's no angel, but in this case he absolutely did not cause the crisis.

What you are asking assumes Bitcoin is one thing. In fact it is a modular program with many parts - all of which require different skill sets.
Bitcoin has it's own API based which allows programs to interact with a running node on the Bitcoin network, however, you may only need to interact with the BlockChain database and that can be done directly without having the node running.
There are frameworks in existence that have been developed that allow you build applications, and the Bitcoin software has been implemented in different languages.
 BitcoinJ is a Java version used in a lot if wallet applications.
Bictoinjs is the JavaScript version, and there are others including python versions.
Bitcoin as far as I know cannot be securely implemented in PHP due to the lack of support with elliptic curve cryptography.
The original Bitcoin code was written in C++ and contains it's own stack based language (similar to Forth) and there is an alternative ground up re-write called libbitcoin.
Choosing the best way to build an app in any if these languages is not so easy as each has its own peculiarities.

I'm pretty surprised that as a "miner" you have no understanding of the basic technology. This is of course the easiest way to lose everything, so can I suggest you read a bit more about cryptography, cryptographic keys, and how they are implemented in Bitcoin.
To answer your question, you cannot simply automate one wallet sending bitcoins to another, unless you write a script to do so, but if you are scared about your computer being compromised (and that is the reason why you want an offline wallet) then a script is a very useful tool for a theif - my advice is DONT WRITE A SCRIPT THAT CAN DO THAT.

I recommend talking above all to Bits of Proof (BOP) Tamas Blummer. He's been doing business specific stuff since the beginning, and has developed some very interesting enterprise level projects. Sadly his presentation skills rarely get that message over.

The issue is whether you believe a journalist ( and we all know how accurate they are) or a qualified lawyer. 
Pretty sure from their answers the OP is a lawyer. Heqvist, is not, nor are Coindesk. 
What is at stake here is understood by legal people and it is completely foolish to suggest that this is not  very serious indeed.
Heqvist is making statements that appear to play down the seriousness and more fool anyone that goes along with this advice. It is the worst legal position in front of the ECJ.
My understanding is that there are well known Crypto tax lawyers from the UK and Belgium who are calling for support on this because it is serious and must be taken seriously.

If they are insolvent in bitcoin, then buying back on another exchange means they have to have bought back at a huge and un recoverable loss.
If they are insolvent in fiat then even if there are exchange trades, there are no deposits, so round and round they go.

Some simple maths should set you straight 
Only invest 10% of what you earn. Why because that 10% may dwarf what you earned in the long run and you get the best of both worlds. You are not getting yourself into financial trouble and investing a small risk amount in the future.
Your argument that spending more now will make you richer than the 10% is flawed logic. It may not happen when for many years, and getting yourself into trouble will inevitably mean that you will have to sell your coins without profit.

Agreed. For those who don't understand the comment this is not public key encryption. This is a way of deriving a common key, however the weakness in this system is that you do not know if you have actually received your first message from Alice or Eve. Eve could have been waiting for Alice to send something to Bob, intercepted it and substituted the information for their own key.
Bob would be none the wiser and Alice in turn would also receive replies from Eve thinking it was Bob.
Eve would therefore have access to the entire conversation.
Public key encryption is different. With public key encryption there are two parts the public part and the private part. When Alice wants to send bob a message she uses Bobs public key to encrypt it. Only Bob can decrypt the message. Once encrypted not even Alice can reverse it. Therefore letting people know your public key is important especially if you want to keep communications private .

I had the same problem recently transferring in person from one account to another at the same branch. They did the paperwork and told me the money was available - I specifically asked them to confirm this - but when I went to use my card it was refused with "insufficient funds"
I called the bank an asked wtf - their first response : computer is down can we call you back?
Second response " we think you have passed the amount you are allowed to spend using your card" a) wtf this was not a credit card but a debit card on my checking account and b) when they (manually) added up my last weeks transactions discovered I had not passed this "security limit" which incidentally I had never heard of before, an that the payment I was trying to make also did not pass the limit. Can we call you back?
Third response "we have fixed it try again"

Forget about trying to convince consumers.
Only talk to merchants. Once the merchants start to realise how much better it is for them, they will start to push Bitcoin to the consumers, simply because it is in their (financial) interest to do so. Compare how much merchants pay for their transactions to Bitcoins "BIG ZERO" and they get it immediately.

The simple answer is that you can never trust everything. So in effect you will have to decide what you consider to be big risks and what you consider to be small risks.
Offline hardware running self compiled software is still not risk free if the random number generator is weak or compromised. So you can never get a perfect solution.
Trezor may have been compromised, but it's a much harder task to compromise the supply chain than you think. By comparison it is relatively easy to compromise a machine that is connected to the outside world.

@_date: 2014-08-26 14:19:02
I think you are deluded about "interest" or just uninformed.
Here's how fiat "interest" works:
If you store your money in a bank account that pays interest, what is actually happening is that the bank is taking your money and making it their own.
They then play the markets with it and use it to pay everyone a little bit back to make them think that their money is working.
When the interest rate set by the central bank is low (as it is now) there is no incentive for the bankers to take your money and lend it out. So they just play the markets instead.
When the central bank interest rate is higher, or more precisely, giving a higher return (yield) than the markets there is an incentive for them to lend it out to businesses and the like.
Here's the rub, they lend out much more than they have in deposits - many many times more in fact, because if they can lend out larger sums (which is a simple accounting trick not real money) they earn real money interest on fictitious money. They pay you a tiny percentage based on real deposits, and keep the huge difference between the two.
Your money is never actually every working *for you*. It is an illusion, and if anything can be described as a Ponzi scheme, then this banking model is it. It's called fractional reserve banking.
Now do you see why Bitcoin is better?
The elephant in the room in case you hadn't worked it out is the fact that house prices have been artificially inflated, by banks lending ever greater sums of virtual money (to gain them ever greater real money interest payments) which means that when (not if) bitcoin goes mainstream everything will start to get back it's true value. As someone said here on this sub before.... there will be blood. House prices will crash as they adjust to the real value.... things will get crazy.

Bad idea. Politicians don't get bitcoin, and even if they did get it, it would be years before it could be used by the public as a national currency. Forcing the issue won't suddenly make it happen.
You need the infrastructure first.
But even if we assume that everybody in Scotland has access to the infrastructure, you still have the issue of what to do with the inevitable debt that a country builds up? Bitcoin is the nemesis of Debt and Credit based currency systems, for it to be widely used, means a somewhat obvious "adjustment" (read devaluation) of *everything*. And that alone will be the most painful experience for those outside of bitcoin.

It's Sweden saying "Fuck You" to the guy.
Let's be very clear - if he is unable to defend himself properly, the court will rule by default in favour of applying VAT on ALL Bitcoin transactions in Europe.
This is a simple point of law, it is not an opinion, but this will be very bad for all exchanges based in Europe including Bitstamp, Kraken and the like.

t9b acutally.
You are swapping your holding for a better price. It's what currency traders do when the price is falling. It's like selling everything, and then buying when the price drops, but less risky. You sell an amount to give you capital to buy back tiny amounts at pre-determined steps as the price drops. When the price reaches your target low price, you either keep your winnings or repeat.
Warning! If the price goes above your original starting price (ie it's moving up) you can rapidly lose a fortune in coins, very very quickly.

You've just encountered the  brickwall for bitcoin adoption. What you are about to experience is a lesson for anyone serious about getting merchants to adopt.
If your merchant is computer literate that will help, but I doubt it. Assuming they are what options are you going to provide them for cold storage? How will you integrate their accounting systems? How will you train their staff? How will you ensure that they have regular customers, and not just YOU, paying with bitcoin? How will you make sure their private keys are safe? How will you determine if they should use HD wallets or just a simple address? How do you stop the staff from replacing the QR code with one of their own...
I could go on and on.
Look I'm a bitcoiner since a while, but unless you face this reality and have a plan to deal with it, you are not going to give the merchant any benefit over all the rest of the payment solutions, because they all offer a huge range of support and bitcoin is starting from scratch.

This is true of any position in the early adopter phase of any product.
But when a product is successful someone other than yourself creates a killer use case that is a perfect match for the man in the street. We don't know what that is yet... But there are thousands of the best minds at work on this.
You should recognise that you are an early adopter, your problem is that you have confused early adopter with investor. Nobody has ever said invest in Bitcoin with the intention of cashing out to fiat. That is where you are mistaken.
By all means look at other investments but don't for one minute think that Bitcoin is one of them. You are either in for the longhaul in which case you have no intention of cashing out, or you are out. Nobody will chastise you if you decide Bitcoin is not for you.... I hope.

Firstly this guy is right, but don't worry about it.
What the block chain mechanism does is allow a provable incorruptible assignment of a property from one person to another. 
The first example of that is with the movement of an asset - money - which is, if you like, a proof of concept that has gone on to become the thing itself - Bitcoin.
So block chains can be created for any reason there does not have to be "just one BlockChain".

"So basically I have a combination of words that if anyone else gets hold of they can take all my Bitcoins?"
Yes. But that is also true of your car if someone gets hold of the car keys. Point being, if you have something of value, you need to look after it well, and learning about what that means is part of the process. 
"Firstly, let's say I print out the recovery seed and store it in a safe place."
Do this more than once. This is good disaster recovery practice. Also, these are just 12 words. Try to remember them too.
What is the advantage of the list of words that Trezor uses?
It comes from a standard dictionary of 2048 words, that is also used by other wallets (bread wallet for example) to create a seed. This means that in an emergency you can recover your coins on another wallet even if there are no more Trezors left in the world.
"Secondly, let's say I keep the seed on an encrypted USB... "
I would never keep my coins on a USB stick, and especially one that I use even if it was encrypted.
There is no guarantee that USB will be around in 10 years time (remember floppy disks?), and flash drives have an unknown archival status. Will you be able to get your flash memory to work in a few years time?
So, just to be sure, that you really lost your coins, can you send us a link to the transaction where you coins got moved. Not saying I don't believe you, but you may be overlooking something.

 Your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:37:00
1) Wooah there! you are mixing a lot of problems together. This is not a single problem so lets go through them.  
a) "Human error." In business human error is more often than not corrected by mutual agreement. Why should this be any different for bitcoin? It should not.  
b) "Businesses who lose customer data suffer." - this has nothing to do with bitcoin.  
c) "... Insurance...credit cards are protected and the person is not liable for the loss" - actually this isn't what happens. The merchant simply has the money taken right out of their accounts. No insurance, no discussions. So the consumer is supposedly protected by theft. What is the bitcoin answer to this? Multisignatures and escrow payments. Imagine DHL is the multisignatory on the payment from the customer... when the goods arrive, the payment is made. End of story, full protection.  
d) "If someone or some-malware hacks into a company's wallet" - there is a thing called cold storage. Impossible to hack because the device that generated the wallet has never been connected to the internet. Bitcoin's answer is safer than your bank.  
2) Again many issues and many "what ifs?". You cannot use "What if" as a point of view. ie What if an asteroid hit the earth and killed everyone, then Bitcoin would be dead. Anyone can invent a hypothetical catastrophe for anything.  
a) Consolidated mining is a potential issue nobody denies that, except that a potential issue is never an issue until it happens. The fact is that although it came close, it has not happened, and those that care about the value of their investment do not want to lose that. It's better to pull out of a mining pool to keep the security, than it is to stay in and risk losing it.  
By contrast retail banks have a far easier issue of abusing money supply than bitcoin - they already have 100% control. It is orders of magnitude easier for a bank to create debt money (ie no money at all) and this is a huge, no, massive risk to the economy. If you really know about this stuff Bitcoin is by a long way far less risky, it is one of the reasons why people like bitcoin.  
b) "there is no way to tell that the miners are not criminals" except that it makes very little economic sense to even attempt a 51% attack - just run the numbers. So in conclusion having 51% of the hash power and abusing that power are two different things.  
3)  
a) "price volatility" - this old nutshell. Listen, start using BTC and once you are inside, you don't want to come out again and the price fluctuations are meaningless. I don't know where you are from, but in any case if you use the dollar or the pound or the euro, then you are "inside" a currency area. The Bitcoin currency area is the world.  
 
b) "trading services or products for BTC and then holding BTC very risky" Why? it's only risky if you intend to cash out, but if you do not intend to cash out, then there is zero risk. In any case, the price is rock bottom compared to what it might be if it becomes successful. Every business that chooses to accept bitcoin is making a big contribution to the long term success of bitcoin, and at the same time reducing their long term risk.  
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:28:50
That's not a proper answer. You need to explain precisely what is wrong in your opinion with the size of the blockchain.
The reason I'm pushing you to give a proper answer is that either you understand the technicalities of the blockchain and bitcoin communication, or you don't. 
So far it seems like you don't understand these things, unless you have spotted something that nobody until now has seen. 
If so please share your observation, or else make your point more clearly.
The things you dismiss in your post are perfectly valid at answering (probably) all your concerns, but of course if you don't know what you are talking about how can you judge the answers you are given?

You have missed the bigger picture in your reasoning. In a world where you cannot just print money or write zeros to an account, things have to be valued **appropriately**.
The elephant in the room is that in a bitcoin world everything, and I mean EVERYTHING has to be valued according to what people can afford to pay, loans cannot exist, therefore like it or not your house will only have the value of what someone can pay for it. If that means the value has to be adjusted - then the market will probably do that for you.
If you are interested fundamentally speaking loans (and most all "credit based" financial products) are the whole reason for the extreme economic situations the biggest countries on earth face right now. They have borrowed so much that tax revenues are almost hardly covering the interest payments. Printing money is the only answer that is given, and most economists insist this is the answer. But we are entering uncharted water, and so the risk is pretty high.
Most people here believe Bitcoin is probably the only way out of this - and those who have looked at the fundamentals with honesty are pretty much in agreement about this. Economists have far too high a vested interest to be honest with themselves which often leads to polemics here.
And yes revaluation will be a consequence.

I don't know if you are reading this Mike, but I get the whole overload idea, except that I don't see any discussion of the automatic adjustment of difficulty playing a role or not as the case may be. I guess that is too slow a mechanism to deal with the inevitable longer block times.
I'm guessing of course, but I'm wondering also if the miner who discovered "the last block before the network fell over" would have a distinct advantage - perhaps for some considerable time, whilst the network recovers. It would not matter that they were not receiving transactions they could keep mining regardless. In fact this would lead to multiple forks of the BlockChain because all miners may be in the same situation.

Ok you missed the point. Regulation applies to point where the use of fiat currency is in place.

Everything else after that is outside of the authority of the regulator. But you have to use Fiat to get there even if you do not intend to go back.

But ripple is a house of cards the same way the current financial system is: it relies on IOUs from "trusted" parties. 
I'm pretty sure the banks will go for ripple in a very big way probably because it's like looking in the mirror. 
Ripple effectively solved their mining problem, by premining everything. I have often wondered if that is their weakness however. When banks actually find out it's centralised and they can't get their greedy hands on all the coins, they may just back away.

Insider trading requires prior knowledge of a companies accounting position before official publication.
The blockchain would not stop this even if the company was 100% bitcoin (customers and suppliers and staff). This is because with HD wallets you are able to generate pay-to addresses that are unique for each payment, and therefore this obfuscates public tracking(read public auditing) on the blockchain.
Company results would therefore always be private until they decided to make them public.
But this is a fundamentally old world view: a world where profitability is king because companies are forever chasing debt and inflation.
In a deflationary bitcoin only world, companies would live or die, not on profitability, but customer adoption. Prices would be constantly falling, therefore quality/speed/reliability/fairness and such like judgements would be made by customers and keeping customers happy would be a much better guarantee of survival. Indeed the profit motive might end up killing your business, simply because you could not compete on price.

This is possibly the most ill conceived post ever.
The lesson for anyone in the public domain should already be clear:
Don't try to answer rumours  on Reddit, unless you are also prepared to provide cast iron proof of what you say, don't discuss your family affairs on a public forum, and especially don't mention your children - this is stupid beyond belief. 
The best thing you can do is hire a lawyer and go back to Cyprus and have a conversation with the police to clear this up.
If you are holding coins on trust as you say, do this: inform reddit where the coins will appear, (ie publish the empty addresses) and then make the payment so that Redditors can witness that you have done this. 
Then ask those 4-5 people to contact your lawyer to collect the encrypted private keys in any way you want, but also post the notification here. 
Follow up by notifying both the police and Reddit when those people collect the coins, so we can witness the transfer from the addresses.
Regarding Neo &amp; Bee, it is either insolvent or not. Have a conversation with your accountant (you have one of those don't you?) and if you really want to be transparent, publish the management accounts here, signed with PGP.

The 'not Bitcoin' attribute.
Look I get the fact that Bitcoin is like a poison pill to everything else, but that could also be true of *coin, if a major player supports a killer app not offered to the Bitcoin community. By the time the effect of the app is recognised it will be too late for Bitcoin. 
Imagine for example that dark coin gets bought by bankers. Fantasy I know, but it would blow up. And every bank starts using it Bitcoin would struggle.

Well this is speculation, but if it costs as much as the link says it costs to build a supercomputer, then that's what it costs. The difference for Bitcoin is that the cost (probably a lot lower) is spread across the thousands of individual miners and some bug ones.

Ghash.io is a mining pool. For it to "go it alone" as you suggest, requires convincing evryone in the pool to do the same, which BTW means giving up block rewards, whilst they are spending huge amounts of energy on mining for free.

@_date: 2014-08-01 01:13:25
Nope. The real value of objects and property would come out when debt is removed from the system. That means that things like house prices in fiat will tumble hugely to match the available supply of bitcoins. Bitcoin only needs to match the actual supply of physical money, cash. It cannot be used in debt based trading. Sorry but that will not make Bitcoin worth 50M+. Cash in use it 4-5trillion dollars, not 1000trillion.
House prices for example only needed to go up to deal with the effects of inflation. If there is no inflation the house price does not need to go up. Indeed it is only because money was produced via debt that people were even able to put the house prices up. Same principle applies to everything.

Interestingly what got me into Bitcoin in 2010 was doing a site with a similar model, the difference was that we were focused on the merchant benefits, because otherwise your site is competing directly with google, and why should they give you the money instead of google? When I posed that question we came up with the idea of a virtual currency, which paid a percentage of profits back to the merchant and charged no advertising fees. 
Then I discovered Bitcoin and that was the end of that other project.

I disagree. Only one has to be compromised, and let's face it with GSM that's a pretty big vulnerability. I guess their young team doesn't have any real world sec experience yet.
EDIT To clarify, the comms between the device and the server carry everything you need to spoof authentication on their backend, plus the address to pay. So I'm guessing it would take me about 1 day to break that if not less.

That's an assumption we don't know that for sure, and secondly they may be relying on the encryption used in the GSM network, and we all know what that means.
All I this is actually besides the point if their servers are unavailable. They are basically making a centralized service that means you cannot sen money I their service is unreachable or to out it another way, the devices themselves are subject to DoS as much as their servers. 
Oh and another point - if big govt wants to shut down a GSM network, it goes right ahead and does it.

Pretty sure this has everything to do with being a ripple gateway. This was the weakness of ripple that most people saw. I'm pretty certain Bitstamp was using the ripple network to facilitate speedy currency withdrawals. This is fine when everyone is solvent but when the price of a ripple tumbles the network as a whole collapses and everyone will convert and withdraw just like a bank run.

"As volatility is stopping mainstream adoption right now..."
This is not a barrier to mainstream adoption and is a huge presumption as to the real reasons. It is one factor, but not **the** factor. 
Studying the adoption cycle you will realise that we are in fact about 4-9 years away from what would be considered "mainstream" adoption numbers, and right now we are still right on track for that target - so don't panic - you are an early adopter.
Lack of widespread infrastructure is a much more important barrier, and this will take much time to resolve - but it's important to know there are many companies working on this. 
Also many people still haven't heard of Bitcoin we need the word out there first, and even if they have, it will take time for them to forget the MtGox fiasco, and not associate Bitcoin with a bankruptcy or SilkRoad (no thanks in small part to lazy journalists).

Thanks that's more or less what I thought - but also given the nature of failed nodes it would also be hard to broadcast a found block meaning that miners everywhere would probably be creating forks of there own with no ability to reconcile their version of the chain against another's, right?

But this is just nonsense and you know it. You cannot have deflation or even hyper deflation unless you are comparing it to outside currencies. Hoarding is only a problem if there is a limit to the divisibility of the money, and where there is no stable predictable monetary controls. Of course monetary controls are programmed in to Bitcoin and it is massively divisible. So the conditions under which would cause hoarding to be a problem don't exist.
Certainly if I and any normal person on the planet automatically got richer as time went on and there was a guarantee that this would always be the case if course you would spend very regularly keeping the economy super buoyant with literally no debt problems. I don't know about you but this is appears to be a better world.

This is actually the functionality of cryptography it is not specifically Bitcoin.
You simply need to encrypt the person's full name and then create a hash from that encrypted hash. This is their private key. This allows you as the administrator to be able to recreate their private key at will but nobody else. Ie it doesn't even have to be stored in a database.
All you as the administrator will need is your own public key with which to carry out the encryption.
In fact you do not even need to store your private key anywhere except on paper.
But you will run up against many problems with doing this, not least that anyone can create a private key and send their coins there, and then everything will be out of your control.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:06:28
I find these arguments absurd. 
Mining rewards with the creation of coins and transaction fees. The ratio of one versus the other changes on the long term but rewards are always there. That is the mining incentive.
The difficulty does not ensure mining rewards go to zero. I have no idea where you get that idea from. What the difficulty does do however is important: it regulates the arms race of powerful chips. It does not however level the playing field - obsolete chipsets remain obsolete and whatever you might suggest Qualcomm are capable of, is equally true of half a dozen other chipmakers. Micro miners are a fictional invention. Don't you know how the big miners work? They already have thousands of machines all micro mining fractions of the process to try to identify likely candidates for the rewards. Decentralizing that setup adds latency to communications and therefore it cannot succeed.

Tax money is currently entirely used to pay interest and capital on the debts that the western world has run up. Do people know this? No. And government want to keep it that way.
What government will not want is you paying in Bitcoin and then looking on the BlockChain to find out that your tax money did not go to pay for roads, schools and the rest of the stuff your government wants you to believe it is used for.
Don't get me wrong, government should be that transparent but it is a long way from that ideal.

You would have an exchange account if you were concerned about swapping between crypto currencies or you were doing it as a trader.

Let me tell you why decentralization is better. One word. Security.
The centralized security model is inherently vulnerable. It concentrates power and is open to abuse and attack. The most important thing about storing money is to trust the bank not to abuse the ledger or cover-up hacks and security issues. Bitcoin protects the ledger by giving everyone a copy and give the network a way to achieve consensus on the ledger meaning it's contents cannot be abused or changed. As a security model it is unquestionably better, and after all I want to put my money somewhere safe.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:21:02
I think you have not understood Bitcoin at all.
Bitcoin is not a company or an agent in the same way that the internet it not a company. With Bitcoin you do not need to trust anyone or anything so your comment is grossly misrepresenting something you clearly don't yet understand.
To put it in simple terms, you become your own bank, and you have the keys to your own vault. You do not need and online company to manage those keys, you do not have to ask permission to access your money or even ask permission to spend it.

Like I said you seem to be the only person on the planet arguing that Moore's Law is over. Perhaps you forgot that graphene changes everything?
Simple algorithms do not have "a plateau" this is total bullshit. The algorithm's speed is determined by the speed at which the chip can perform the basic task of moving bits - Moore's Law is directly related to the speed at which bits are processed. It doesn't matter if it is done on a piece of paper or in a computer, but one is clearly faster than the other. If you improve the speed at which this task can be done by changing the materials you have a technical advantage, but not for long and nowhere near as long as 21 would need to make a viable business model.
And just in case you hadn't realised it - changing the material is one aspect, changing the distance is another - when 28nm chips were discussed as being a breakthrough back in the day - it was important because, literally the electrons have to travel less distance and therefore were technically faster (in computing terms bits are also related to voltage but that is a whole other discussion). So when 21 imply that distributing their chips over huge geographic distances is somehow an advantage they are ignoring the necessary latency that would be introduced. That's why miner farms are mainly all under one roof.
I guess you are buying this stuff, it's more than a difference of opinion, but if you are right I will admit it come that day, but right now this is technically pie in the sky.

It isn't a question of numbers. As long as there are better performing chips out there you lose. That's just a fact, and by the way the end game is more than 20 years from now, even if it did make sense to have so many devices mining, you have to wait 20 years to make a chip worthy of that year's technology and roll it out quickly.

The problem with the idea that millions of miners are out there is that they cannot hope to make any return at all. Today miners optimize but getting their pools to concentrate on working "likely candidates" for the block. This requires consistent coordination to work, but as I said it also requires many small miners to be doing the grunt for love and if you then split the rewards by a large number if small miners you end up with dust - un spendable dust.
Finally I'm all for open standards and whatnot, but nobody is going to waste money installing chips on their boards that give no measurable benefit to consumers. If I was a hardware guy, this would be the first thing to be dropped.

Ok this is common misunderstanding about what encryption is.
If there is a man in the middle all you might be doing is sending an encrypted address to the man in the middle using their public encryption key not your intended recipient's public encryption key. This happens because you are exchanging public encryption keys at the point of needing to obtain the Bitcoin address.
The only way to be 100% sure that you are encrypting anything to the intended person is if, and only if, you have exchanged public encryption keys a significant time in advance of your need to use them.
What this means in effect is that you are using time itself to give you security. The shorter the time is between your encryption key exchange and the need to use the key, the greater the risk that you are performing a key exchange with a MITM. 
So how do you solve this problem?
A common (but rather techie) way is to post your public encryption key in a social media or forum post. This provides a timestamped entry that is almost pointless to tamper with, and anyone can know that you sent the Bitcoin address if you also sign the address using your time hardened public encryption key to check the signature. Nobody could tamper with the Bitcoin address because they would also have to tamper with the signing mechanism. 
But that is not user friendly.

So how does someone else validate against your hash? That's what I think Factom is providing, that your hash wouldn't.
However, you cannot reverse a hash to obtain the original data, so even if you could prove that the library was tampered with, you cannot sadly retrieve the original. Unless what they are proposing is keeping a copy of the original, either on a centralised or distributed database, but even then that would be problematic.

Which century are you from?
The first two are just odd and completely meaningless. There are many elements on the periodic table that also have industrial use. But to be specific the industrial us of gold is a minuscule fraction of the gold held by countries as assets. So this in itself is bullshit.
Regarding Bitcoin "not staying the same" I'm not sure what you mean and I'm not sura that you know that entries on the BlockChain are a permanent record stored on millions of computers around the world. As a matter of fact that storage is far less of a size than most people's photo collection, and to destroy that record requires destroying every computer and back-up system that has ever had the BlockChain on it. 
That's a pretty robust thing you have right there.
Lastly reputation is something earned with age, Bitcoin is only 6 years old, and yes it might fail but if it does it won't be because it isn't gold. 
Gold is actually shown to be useless as money, you can't transport quantities of it easily, no does it have any practical use in making payments. If it is deflationary it causes a huge problem of giving change from blocks of the stuff (that's why silver was needed) and it is a huge risk to hold any quantity of gold at home. You can't cross borders with gold, you can have your gold confiscated need I go on...?

Personally I don't think the Ripple model is long-term good on the basis that it is a crypto version of traditional banking with IOUs being the backbone.
But on the other hand, there is a lot of money in banking, and if they are looking to have something crypto that suits their mentality, it will be Ripple... untill the banks fail and then they'll dump everything including Ripple.
If you are looking for speculation then Ripple has the ingredients, just be prepared to move  when the signs are there, but if you are looking for longevity, stability and fairness Bitcoin (or even dare I say it Litecoin) is better long-term bet.

So following your logic: you have several addresses with Bitcoin in that you control the keys to and that is not centralised point control? Of course it is.

There is one considerable advantage over alts - the ability to interchange with Bitcoin without requiring an exchange (third-party).
This means you can create an alt the can be swapped to and from Bitcoin or two and from other side-chain alts transparently.
Imagine you go into a shop that issues their own coin on a side chain. They want you to use this because they don't require huge investment in Bitcoin to do so. What advantage is there to the customer? Well they can spend this anywhere, even in other shops, who might in turn give change in their own coin simply because it is pegged to Bitcoin. I can see why a shop might want this, but I can also see why the customer would need this too. They don't even have to know that all this crypto is going on behind the scenes.
What is interesting is that they don't need separate wallets for separate coins as is the case now with alts.
The outcome of this is far faster transaction speeds (zero confs) and far more coins in circulation, and a far more solid position for Bitcoin. Alt coins in the current sense become redundant.

No it isn't. That's just a distributed database. 
The breakthrough is THE COMBINATION of the distributed ledger AND the incentive (Bitcoin) to keep it secured from corruption.
Banks either get this or they don't. By trying to focus on the ledger alone they are not addressing corruptability of the BlockChain because there is no sum of fiat money big enough to stop a wealthy group from achieving corruption. That's why a whole new currency was required to provide the incentive that had value in the ecosystem itself.

This is undoubtedly true for Bitcoin as it is for litecoin - but not necessarily all alts
@_date: 2015-04-03 07:47:02
I'm going to state an undiscussed fact: if you understand the reasons why Bitcoin's BlockChain is indestructible - the same thing applies to litecoin and all the alt coins. Therefore in some respects if you are looking to storage for a long time, pick the one you think is most likely to be around.
I think Litecoins and Dash have a very good chance of staying the distance... But that isn't your question, your question is about investment.
It is a mathematical fact that investing in litecoin will give better returns than Bitcoin simply because litecoins measure in single digit dollars. But you will also lose more faster it goes south... 
Personally I can't see litecoin going any farther down, and if major players start looking at the lat coins again when Bitcoin spikes again, then you are quids in.
But if Bitcoin dies, your hedge with litecoin will not be a hedge, it will die too.
If you want a hedge try fiat - seriously - that's the point right?
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:39:08
One point I haven't seen raised is that the gap tracks the deposits but  later returns with a significant difference from the expected amounts. 
My view is that cold storage was being used during that gap, but when the coins reappear it is a fraction of the expected amount. Already at that point the graphs show that somewhere there are coins not accounted for.
Additionally I don't understand how the fees are accounted for.  would it be entirely feasible for the leaking BTC to be fees?

A side chain can operate with any policy it decides to implement, monetary or otherwise. So imagine that you are issuing a currency but that your ledger is centrally controlled. It gets the benefit of making the decision to allow a payment or not. Therefore it does not need to follow bitcoin's rules over confirmations, so you could have a proper zero confirmation transaction in the side chain.
Likewise if your side chain is issuing coins pegged to Bitcoin then you are adding potentially spendable coins. Let's say your side chain is pegged to Bitcoin for the price of x, and then you issue your currency at factors of x in quantity. They circulate in your side chain but not in Bitcoin so you are in effect adding to Bitcoin via an altcoin.

Both these points are wrong. The answer is yes this was planned. The original gold standard was not broken, it was replaced with a pseudo gold standard, that started the decoupling of gold from fiat currency. It allowed the federal reserve system to come into play and eventually the use of a global reserve currency - the US dollar - that came out of Breton Woods. This reserve currency replaced gold as the common global unit of settlement.

Again wrong. Banks make you list out your expenses as well as your income. But granted, when banks started to get lax about considering the customers ability to repay based on this information, and in some cases did not validate the customers income declaration - you end up with the mess of the last financial crisis.
But to hit the point home: a bank would never lend more than your income. But in the current crazy country level lending, they do on the understanding that if the countries cannot pay they will take money directly from the people - you might know that as Austerity, a deal for the people without their agreement.
When the Europeans moved to the Euro they removed the mechanism that made it possible to lend directly to Europe, with a long term vision of eliminating the need for loans to countries altogether. The problem is that there were legacy loans, and no agreement to ban further loans. So countries continued to borrow more and more betting that the ECB would cave in and bail them out. The lenders have known this for a long time, and if you think the Germans and the Greeks are on different sides, you are mistaken. They are both fighting the same enemy: out of control state level debt.

At 7 transactions per second it is not built to scale. And given the fact that nobody can agree to change this is problematic. You can't force the change through because it is a decentralised system.
So if you can't adjust the nr transactions per second because nobody implements the change it's a stalemate - hence it is not scalable.

Yep you bought the GDP koolade. Just think about this for a second. If GDP is the total sum of everything that the country generates, what percentage of that does your government have access to? Ah yes, a very small percentage and that percentage is called tax revenue.
So the real calculation is "what is the debt as a percentage of tax revenue" and you will find that this is far greater than 100%.
That's the real story behind the numbers. Make of that what you will but my conclusion is that using GDP as justification for country debt is like me asking for a loan on saying that the total sum of all salary in my street shows that the debt is manageable.
Of course you can call that what you will but Bitcoin or not, that's a fucking crime.

Are you absolutely sure what you pay in taxes is being used in the way the believe it is? The reality is I am afraid somewhat different, when you start to look at the debt. Those things are bought on the never never, and to maintain them obliges your country to borrow more. So your taxes are being used to repay the borrowings, until that is not enough, and then the lenders turn your country into Greece where they are not able to obtain basic medicines in hospitals, and the rest.

Frankly it doesn't matter what you said here because you don't understand how a decentralised system works. 
Let me explain: even if the code is implemented, it requires the majority of the network to agree and adopt. In this case we are talking about a hard fork - it is very difficult to get the network to agree to this on the basis that it is not a bug fix like the example you gave, but a supposed enhancement. Even your own comment seems to suggest that you don't think it is necessary, so think carefully: you have to convince literally thousands of people that a hard fork is necessary AND you have to get them to adopt which includes adopting an unknown risk to them.

Part of this history is not because of bad monetary policy, but the fact that the "winners" of WWI sent a bill to the "loser" as a punishment. 
Hyperinflation was a tool used to decrease the value of the invoice, and arguably the next thing the "winners" did - asset seizure, lead to the rise of right wing patriotism in Germany - later fascism, and Hitler. Ultimately it lead to WWII.
So it is not really anything to do with hyperinflation that may be caused by current monetary policy.

To answer your question, because the money that you think is your is not yours once it has been deposited. You might be under the misunderstanding that you are even protected up to a certain amount, but that is again in reality that is no longer true.
The recent G20 meeting in Australia agreed rules that would change how depositors money was legally allowed to be used, and now all depositors regardless of the size of deposit are creditors. This means that if the bank fails, they simply close your account AND TAKE IT ALL. 
The trouble is that most people simply don't believe this could happen and believe that they have protection. You only need to ask the people of Cyprus how it feels to wake up one morning and find you were completely wrong.
Check your bank's small print. I guarantee that some form of capital control is already in place.

Because when you sign a transaction you have to sign the entire raw transaction. If you are proposing to cluster many inputs all of the involved parties must all be aware if the entire contents of the transaction.
If your service is proposing to do this at some later time - as explained by your clustering - and not at the time of payment, then your service must have the private key to do this. The customer cannot sign because they cannot possibly know the future content of the cluster.

I think you are assuming that QR codes are the way to go. They have been around for ages, but are far too limited in scope to be useful in the long run. You just can't get enough information into them.

Another view is that deflation is a correction in both demand and prices. The problem is that when you get used to seeing high demand because that demand is created from borrowing, any correction should be welcomed.
The elephant in the room with Bitcoin is that it forces the issue - there must be a forced correction to the price of all goods and services in order for us to have back control of our economies.
This is a nightmare scenario for those who preach borrowing as a means of growth, and these are the self same people that have a huge amount to lose if Bitcoin becomes successful.

You are somewhat deluding yourself that if Bitcoin is successful the other currencies will still be needed or have value. Your insistence that you need to make some future value comparison this way is misleading your reasoning.
That being said there is a view that Bitcoin was designed specifically not to be workable in a debt based economy. What you are trying to do is compare a debt based economy (getting a mortgage) with a non-debt based one (buying the house with what you have because there is no gov to create money from nothing). Yes, under those circumstances there will be a re-valuation of everything, and it will be very painful for those people who have a lot of fiat currency and who don't have or want Bitcoin.
Don't fall into the trap of believing that there is scarcity either. 21M multiplied by 8 decimal places is enough slicing to replace the entire global cash supply, and then some. Just think of it this way: you hold a Dollar for 10 years and the decimal place moves in the WRONG direction.
Lastly, Bitcoin is cheap now. Cheap enough that almost everyone - and I mean mostly the people with no money at all - can afford to buy 1 BTC. If it fails, then it won't break them. If it succeeds it will change the balance of financial power in the world forever. 
I tell everyone I know, that if they buy Bitcoin and later change their minds I will buy it back off them regardless of who they bought it from.

This is what Ponzi naysayers simply don't get.
It is because of these possibilities that that bitcoin has a value that is rising over time. It is because there are literally thousands of people working on producing products and services that will permit Bitcoin to make use of these features, that Bitcoin has a long term value.
It is only partly speculation, and nobody ever said you were guaranteed to make money with bitcoin. It just is turning out that way.

The BlockChain is a public record of who had what at any point in time. That would not change. So we have a roll back possibility.

I'm going to answer this more thoroughly again because it requires it.
The line is based on **product** growth, and that information (sales data) is always hidden to outsiders but available to people inside the business. It has nothing to do with past price (of shares or anything else).
*The reason why we have rules against insider trading is exactly because this calculation exists and can be used for profit.* 
If you want to know, then if you had even six months accurate sales data for the iPod you would have been able to predict the growth curve, from which you could have inferred the share price accordingly. You would not have been far off at all, and yes you would have made a fortune, because you would have had insider knowledge not just on the current sales, but *all future sales in the cycle*. That's just the way it works.
With Bitcoin this data is public, it is everywhere, there is nothing to stop anyone performing the same calculations. There is nothing to stop anyone from making the connections. It's perfectly up to you what you decide to believe, but even as we speak, the November prediction is coming into sight.

I haven't said speculation isn't happening, in all evidence it is. But it would only be a bubble if it was overvalued. The long term outlook is far higher than even today's price, so the market is just doing what markets do and moving to the correct price.
I'm not sure if you were also convinced it was a bubble on the other occasions, but like most people who say this you give no Bitcoin related evidence that demonstrates your belief. In the other hand there is plenty of empirical evidence to support the view that this is not a bubble.
If it is a bubble what price do you think it will have to fall to, on a permanent basis for you to consider it burst? Just for the record.

I didn't need to read any further. "Most people who save" is in fact hardly anyone at all. I don't know who you are speaking on behalf of but it isn't the human race. 




What's your point? That somehow I don't understand how or why companies try to mitigate losses on currency exchanges? That somehow bitcoin won't solve this huge problem? 




I am not hoping anything. I don't think you have really grasped the reasons why fiat currencies lose value over time.


I believe you said they were "absolute". Now you've changed your mind. 


I don't disagree with this, but if you insist on applying debt based economics to a non-debt based currency, you will of course come to the wrong conclusion as to how or why this is achieved.






You seem to be stuck in a fixed point in time where you cannot think beyond your current time-frame. If you are going to understand bitcoin, you'll have to be a bit more creative than that. Gold cannot do the things that bitcoin can. For example you can't transport gold across the world in an instant neither can you divide it up and make payments with it. It is complete nonsense to keep referring Bitcoin as "a commodity" or being "treated like gold". I don't see "commodities" being used to buy books or shoes, neither do I see gold being hoarded.
I do grant you that at this time, you cannot use Bitcoin everywhere, and it is difficult to get hold of, but that does not mean it is therefore "a commodity", neither does it mean it is being hoarded and therefore scarce. These are the two central points you seem to be making and neither of them are correct.

The economic output cannot be taken in isolation. You also have to factor in the debt, and the ability for that output to "overcome" the debt.
Printing money to augment "output" is demonstrably not enough to overcome the debt.
If the total debt is greater than the output, the dollar is  backed by words, not any thing real. If the US was a company it would be bankrupt a long time ago, and you would not trust a bankrupt company with your goods, why therefore do you still hold on to the idea that an insolvent nation is somehow more solvent than evidence would suggest?

I don't want to upset the applecart but this misses the point: once we are in a Bitcoin world, the other currencies become meaningless much like the French Franc or the German Mark, now that there is Euro.
I'm not saying the Euro is superior or anything like Bitcoin, just that a prominence of Bitcoin means that people will start to abandon fiat. You won't care about transferring your bitcoins to dollars or euros if those currencies, and why would you? That would be like selling your bitcoins and investing in something that you can absolutely guarantee will lose value.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:25:45
Agree. Currency collapse is a consequence of the success of Bitcoin. The other consequence which economists absolutely freak out over is a non-debt based society. They freak out because everything would have to be revalued. I mean everything. 
My house will be worthless in fiat, if the only buyers have Bitcoin, and they sure ain't going to pay the fiat price. That is scary but at the same time worth the pain.

I try to explain this to people all the time. They are interested, even shocked, and then promptly forget everything. I hate to say it, but it weighs heavy on me that people don't get this. 
I walked through London the day after the Bitcoin Conference, I had lunch with a skeptical Civil Servant, who had heard of it, but was dismissive, and as i looked at everyone, I couldn't help thinking, "you really have no idea". I don't want this to get all messy, but I have to say I totally agree with you when you say it is inevitable.

I have argued elsewhere that Bitcoin only *appears to be* deflationary, because we are viewing it from inside an inflationary system.
That is to say that because fiat currencies are *designed* to lose value over time, and because actions such as Quantitative Easing (printing money) add to inflationary issues, anything that holds it's value, by comparison, could be said to be "deflationary". You have to make your own mind up about that, but let me add another point.
If you change your perspective and imagine that you are inside the bitcoin economy, looking outward so to speak, you would be unaffacted by the loss in value of other currencies due to *their inflation*. It does not follow that you are in a deflationary economy just because everybody else has a monetary policy that causes their currency to lose value. So it is very misleading to assume this, perhaps because you heard someone say it.
So the question is firstly, doesn't it make sense in the internet age to have one currency for the world? Politics aside, assuming that the power of the masses decides this fate in favour of bitcoin, what reason would there be for prices to change over time either up or down? It comes down to market forces against profiteering. In a world with endless suppliers, and one currency, if you don't like the price somebody gives you here, you will be able to buy it there at the price you think is reasonable. The market would adjust itself.
Lastly you touched on the savings point. This always comes up in discussions, but it pre-supposes so many things that are just not true, in order to make the hoarding point.
* it presupposes that nobody has to eat, shit, or get buried.
* it presupposes that everybody is saving at the same time for a future date x, and that everybody is the same age and has the same needs already satisfied right now.
* it presupposes that the reason for saving money is not - as you state - to have a reserve of buying power.
* it presupposes that human nature means that we actually want to save instead of buying, even though the entire western (and arguably the entire world) economy is based on the notion that the majority of people spend it when they have it, with no regard for the future.
To answer your question, I don't class Bitcoin as deflationary, for the reasons above, but I do see people spending bitcoin and using it as real money when they realise that it does not lose it's value over time.

I'm not going to discuss this further if you don't see the underlying problem with both those scenarios. It may sound like you are promoting growth, but the motivation for doing both of those things should not bee to be there. 
It's only because debt is there that what you describe becomes "necessary".
Why would you have to work (to repay your debts) if there was something in existence that provided cross generational wealth storage? You could work because you wanted to not because you had to.
Why do you need to risk *other people's wealth* in arbitrage? What is making it necessary to have to do this? People's money is not game, but you (like most economists and bankers) seem to think it is.
Want to talk about being shafted? How about my fathers pension fund which he could not touch because that's how it works, being reduced to nothing, him getting nothing and the fund managers year after year taking their fees? 
Want to talk about loans taken with*payment protection* totally worthless.
Want to talk about insurance companies that make it their business not to pay out most claims? Insurance that is legally required.
Want to talk about how money in the bank becomes worthless over a very short period of time.
Almost all of those things are beyond yours or my control. With Bitcoin none of that needs to happen.
Either you get it or you don't. But don't ask me to explain anything more.

It does not clear the government of :
A) recognizing that bitcoins have a market value
B) authorizing a transaction in bitcoins to take place
C) setting a legal precedent 
Update : and another point is that for the last 9 months the government has been sending the message that it wants companies that convert Bitcoin to fiat to register as a money transmitter. They will have to ask the auction house tondo the same otherwise they cannot sell the coins.

Actually I have argued elsewhere that Bitcoin is not a commodity at all.
From Wikipedia:


The more specific meaning of the term commodity is applied to goods only.
The only reason why it is called a commodity is because we haven't yet seen widespread use as cash *at this point in time*. This makes economists try to fit it into the category of "commodity" because it 
a) helps them get their heads around bitcoin
b) allows them to apply old world thinking to try to predict a value against existing currency
c) allows them to discount/denigrate/otherwise rule out a future where bitcoin is the only currency

I'm not talking of the IP on Blockchain.Info - i'm talking about someone looking at outgoing traffic from general IP addresses to check - for example - if that address is sending anything to others peers. Node discovery has to happen with a bitcoin client (unless I'm mistaken) and it is known what the client goes through to do this.
Assuming you have identified an IP address by this method.... I know that your wallet is (initially) a collection of (empty) addresses. But the moment you start to use them, if your IP is the same as the one already discovered and it is not just forwarding but receiving you could draw the conclusion that someone in the household is using Bitcoins. 
It won't tell you who, or anything else about who owns the wallet, but law enforcement doesn't really care about that.

This is not an "obvious bubble", that's just a point of view, and actually not based on reality. Indeed the curve such that it is does not point to a bubble, but to steady predictable growth. You obviously have not looked at the adoption figures in any detail, nor have you applied the standard well established formulas to understand this. Market price has exceeded growth in the past, but as yet it has never "burst", if anything it has just re-joined the predicted path.

I'm glad for you that you are an early adopter, but I'm not bothered about being weathly, I just want to have my money under my control, and not have it eroded in value by design. I want other people to have this same chance.


Of course it matters what causes it - that is the *whole point*. That's why bitcoin was designed the way it was to retain value when governments debase their currencies. 


Isn't this exactly what a deflationary currency will do, without the work bit?
I think you missed the point about expanding goods and services. It just didn't happen when the Euro was introduced, it isn't therefore an argument against Bitcoin adoption. It's irrelevant in fact.

I thought the whole point was that it *did propogate*. So if you accepted coins into your wallet that had taint, you were screwed.

Combatting scammers is one thing tax evasion is another.
Personally if the taxes we pay we're going into all the social projects that government is supposed to manage, and not paying the banks or fighting wars, the I'm ok to pay taxes. But until we have Bitcoin as a currency and they accept then there is no way for me to independently audit where my money is going. That's all I ask.
Scammers will probably always exist, I don't see that Bitcoin could ever present that tainted coins or not, and like the OP said we will undoubtedly find a workaround.

This should be a lesson to the whole community, not just the person who lost the coins. We - I include myself in the community - are not doing enough to educate those who are trying this for the first time. We need to get the message across that bitcoin is about being your own bank and it takes a different approach if you want to guard your own money.
I know there are online wallets, and some of the community are building these and they are very trustworthy people, but the fact is that they are just not as safe as having your own. We need to look at ways of providing this security as a priority. Scams like this will continue to happen unless people have the coin under their own control.

See my other comment. The problem they have is that they are requiring companies who exchange bitcoins for dollars to register under FinCen as a money transmitter. So before they could do this they would have to get an auction house to register as a money transmitter.
Or else they have to use an exchange which is already registered like MtGox, except withdrawing the dollars is a long and painful process because of all the barriers that they have in place...

I have a friend who just spent 6 months doing a very serious analysis of Bitcoins growth and future growth, based on some very well tested calculations. He will release it shortly, but as I have said elsewhere on Reddit, the value of Bitcoin can be correlated with it's growth, so much so, that so far this year the same unchanged formula has hit 7 of the 11 months prices on the nose some three of which were predicted before they happened.
The calculations are not affected by external factors, which makes them very interesting and reliable apparently

Well, it won't happen overnight, but the fact of the currencies losing value is a direct result of poor monetary policy. Bitcoin (and gold for that matter) only highlight this fact, Bitcoin moreso than gold.
Redistributing the wealth is never a bad thing BTW.

You can't have it both ways. You can't talk about the current time frame and apply your reasoning to all future events without discussing alternative outcomes. 
I haven't seen a single point you have raised that does anything other than rely on a snapshot of how you see Bitcoin today. So of course you are going to get wound up. There are only two scenarios: 1) Bitcoin fails. 2) Bitcoin is the only currency in the world. (You'll have to rethink your 101 for that one).
That's OK though. We can have this discussion again in 10 years. Maybe you will be right, I'm quite happy to concede that if at some time in the next 10 years nobody spends any bitcoins (or its best successor/competitor) it will be dead. No conditions.

Good debate btw. I'm quite enjoying this. 
"Why didn't QE cause inflation?" I believe is the question asked, and answered. It has been 5 years after all?
Of course I can't predict the future, but it would have made a lot more sense to ask that question with the benefit of hindsight, and the fact that QE is being used all over the world (not just the dollar by the way) means that we cannot reasonably be expected to conclude that we - the whole world almost - are out of the woods yet. If we were, why pave the way to deal with things by extending Bail-in laws, and why continue to print money? 
I'm not wishing for a crisis again, I am just not convinced that there are any signs that QE has no inflationary store, and it's way too early to call.

This is just a daft thing to say. Yes if you measure in percentages it is double, but the amount of money that is required to enter the market to do it is tiny compared to Bitcoin. This means that an investor could see a return very quickly when a relatively small number of players enter the market.
For example with 12M bitcoins at 800 each that's a market cap of $9.6 billion, meaning to double would require a further $9.6 billion.
Whereas litecoin has a market cap of $200M meaning that it only has to add that amount for your investment to double. To me, once Bitcoin speculators realise this it is likely that they will take some profit and move the Litecoin
@_date: 2013-08-21 20:27:00
I know why you are getting it wrong. You're still holding on to the idea that a universal currency cannot ever exist. 
This is problematic because you can't really discuss Bitcoin economics with any degree of authority without speculating on that point. You see, your whole argument is based on the idea that *this could never happen*. Whereas what is being discussed is a scenario; where it is happening, or has already happened. If the dollar equivalent to bitcoin was anywhere near $10 000 you could draw no other conclusion than something had either gone seriously wrong with the dollar or bitcoin had taken hold to the point where the writing was on the wall for the dollar and all other currencies. 
Admittedly, at this point in time it is hypothetical, but so is your speculation that it won't ever happen. We can agree to differ on that.
So yes, in your world (where nobody would ever use bitcoin) and bitcoin was worth $1000,000 if you were still using dollars prices would appear to have risen, but if you were using bitcoin, you would be protected from that. You wouldn't care what happened to the dollar. 
But here's a reality check for you: people would no longer be using the dollar. Just look at Argentina and countless other countries over the years. When the currency is unreliable people will do anything to get the currency that has the best value.  
Ever spent time in sub-saharan Africa? I was in Ghana for a while. Their currency was a standing joke, but if you wanted to give people something they wanted you'd give Sterling, or the Dollar or even your watch.
People want something of value so they can survive, and so they can show off - that is simply human nature. The Africans had no intention of hoarding the Dollars they were given, they just wanted to go spend it on something, either food or some treat.

If I use a separate receipt address for each of my clients individual transactions... then who's to say I am the owner of any of them?

But if they did that then they would be setting a legal precedent which would defeat any attempts to prosecute other companies that sell Bitcoins for not registering.
Or else you have to make an exceptional law that allows auctions to do it but nobody else..... And then you open the flood gates to selling coins ebay style again. They can't legally win this one if they want to sell the Bitcoins.

Where's your evidence? As far as I know the majority of people who actually own bitcoins are not looking to cash-in, but to use bitcoins. So from the start your assumption is wrong. It's just pure speculation to say otherwise.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:28:55
It's not too late in the long term Bitcoin will grow, but it become increasingly harder as the price rises. Think about it, to double your investment now, you would need to grow the price from $760 which it currently is to $1520. That a huge amount of market capital to add in a short time. Maybe the Chinese have got it in them... I can't say.
What I can say is though (and I know this is going to annoy a few people) if you are looking for a speculative punt... Litecoin is still under $10. Although it doesn't have the same backing as Bitcoin, it only has to go to $20 to double your money.
Remember where Bitcoin was at the start of the year?

I've worked in industry for years. You know when businesses are in financial trouble when they wobble. The signs are always the same.
I can't say what is happening at coinbase, perhaps it is happening at other sites too. Personally - experiencing severe problems at BTC-e.
If exchanges are taking peoples money and not transferring it to sellers this is a huge problem. I agree - it will harm bitcoin.
What appears to be happening if you read between the lines is that these exchanges are operating a kind of "fractional reserve banking" approach, which as we all know is shaky at best. ie only holding enough real cash or bitcoins to service a small number of withdrawals, and this has likely come back to haunt them.
This is *the only reason* why an exchange would refuse to send you bitcoins, or cash.
Where does the other money go? Your guess is probably as good as mine - in their pockets.

I think you'll find it's actually the contrary. The decision to use austerity as a means to improve the situation, has been found out not only to be incorrect but has the potential to be catastrophically worse under the current circumstances. The circumstances I talk of are falling tax revenues.
You have to exclude news articles, and go for the source of the real data to get a more accurate picture of what's really going on. I don't want to try to convince you, that's not the point. What I will ask you to do is read the details of information that is freely available about your country's debt. Think about what debt is, who it is owed to, and what the possibilities are for repaying that debt. Be realistic, think about the consequences, for you and your family, think about what your government is saying it is doing, and then look at what it is actually doing. Read about bail-in. Ask yourself "why after all this time is it being introduced?" Ask why introduce it if it wasn't necessary to use it?
if you are able to find evidence of real practical solutions that are actually changing the debt for the better please let us all know. 
When I say "economists agree" it is not speculation, it is also the conclusion you will reach once you have read the facts. And if you have the ability to talk to the people that matter... you might find that off the record, to story is different to what you read in the papers.

The fact that there are moves to include bank depositors is worrying to say the least.

I think people who use the term "invest" in the context of Bitcoin misunderstand much about the purpose and sentiment behind it's creation. That's not what it was designed to do.
Having said that the mechanisms that devalue a currency over time are not applicable for Bitcoin. This means that long term - I'm talking 10-15years the relative value of other currencies to Bitcoin will shrink simply because fiat currencies are designed to decrease in value relative to themselves. Bitcoin by comparison will appear to increase in value, when in fact all it is doing is storing value over time, just as gold does.

I get this, but there is a small problem, I know he talks about mBTC but doubling this is the same as doubling bitcoins value now. It means adding another 9.6$ billion to the market cap, and then another 19.2 billion in the next doubling. 
Those are absolutely huge sums, and whilst I am Bitcoin through and through, the article would better be talking about litecoin, that's sitting where Bitcoin was in July last year. 
Bitcoin may double ten times, but the rate at which it happens is going to slow because of the amount of capital required to get there.

The idea of any kind of monitoring, is control. If say, a bank doesn't like what you do, it just freezes your account, and it's up to you to prove that you are not doing something. Pretty hard to prove a negative, even if you are innocent. 
What the proposition of having a list of "valid" anything is that the people who control the list have all the control, and have all the power. It means what they say goes, and you have to suck it up. Imagine they just decided you were a bad person, and entered your coins onto the "bad list". Or imagine some malicious person sent you some "bad list coins" just to screw with you. You'd have a very hard time defending your case. Especially with no "valid" money.
The idea behind Bitcoin is that none of this kind of manipulative shit that we've all had to suck up over the years can be done to us, if we don't let it. And we won't.

Firstly the benchmark you use is flawed. You cannot judge the revenue of a country by its GDP, because that also includes loans and this grossly skews the real figures.
For example, I have a company A which borrows money from a bank who doesn't actually have the money, to buy new equipment from company B. The revenue from company B is included in the calculation of GDP. Do you see what I mean?
So in a financial collapse, everything has to be revalued, and if the world (hopefully) switched to Bitcoin it would mean no loans unless the Bitcoin actually exists. This is pretty scary I have to admit, but once we are through it, everything gets its proper value including GDP.

When money is a computer program, the sky is the limit. 
But sometimes there is a trade off between what people think might be a good idea and (often) security. I'm buidling something that might just answer your questions in a way, and a lot is already thought of in the core bitcoin protocol. That's what makes it such an incredible piece of work.
But even I am coming across technical hurdles that are not easy to cross without a trade off. And some of these trade offs may be a step too far in the wrong direction.
I'm not saying ideas and features aren't cool, I'm saying the technicalities of implementing some ideas need careful consideration. Especially when we are talking about people potentially losing money.

It has nothing to do with where I sent the money. But for information it went from a UK bank to the international branch if the same bank. It was then transferred by the bank to BNPParisbasFortis, who transmitted the funds vie Swift message to Mayzus Financial Services a UK company. The funds were then transferred to BTC-e where they credited my account.
It sat in my BTCe account for a few days and then I bought coin.
Some of those coins were transferred out then they blocked the account.

Well the data is everywhere, but mainly software downloads is the key, plus the possible future target audience.
The 1000 wall is according to all reason speculative, but that doesn't mean it is a bubble, all it means is that the market wants the price now, and not later when it would naturally achieve it.
I do agree this isn't a good thing, because it makes it very difficult now for the average person to get "whole bitcoins" (I know that this is nonsense) which is a psychological thing.
@_date: 2013-07-23 20:21:58
I'm not sure you understand how Bitcoin works. Transactions are not sent directly to the recipient. They are sent to the network, which in turn updates a ledger.
The recipient has access to the unspent coins that are associated with a wallet, but neither the ledger or the wallet directly identify the person.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:28:58
Bitcoin is not stock. It is firstly a cash system, but it's a whole lot more. You obviously have never made a transaction or cryptographically signed anything. Do that first before make such ill informed remarks.
Enron, for what it's worth was run by a bunch of people who took measures to hide their debts from their shareholders. Whatever you might think Bitcoin is, it is absolutely not Enron nor does it have a management board who could do anything like this. There is no management. That's what decentralised means.
Madoff's Ponzi scheme was just that. A central actor, acting for his own benefit, by claiming amazing profits on his fund. If you think Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme based on the fact that it rises in value against the dollar (or other currency) does that mean that any other currency that rises against the dollar is also a ponzi scheme? No of course not.
Bitcoin has value because it has a very long term future as a means of exchange. We are the early adopters, and the infrastructure is being built right now to make it easy for shops to use bitcoin. Are the current price rises a problem? No of course not. It benefits both the store owners and the shoppers using bitcoin equally.

It's an oxymoron for you to use the expression "cognitive dissonance". For all your education you forgot to learn about real people who "spend it when they have it" because they need to shit, eat and bury each other. By the way in case you hadn't noticed, we're only on this planet for a few years so let's treat ourselves a bit shall we. Oh yeah, and nothing is for free.
That said let's examine your "experience".


That's a whole other discussion... but whilst we are on the subject, have you ever asked yourself what GDP actually means when it is orders of magnitude greater than the actual amount of money in circulation?


See my first para.


That's just old world thinking, because you only have two decimal places to play with. In fact you have to consistently reduce the value of your money just to keep those two decimal places.
With Bitcoin, subdividing the coin further, not only increases everyone's wealth, but allows them to spend more without hurting their future. You can't say that of fiat. 




I don't think you read this properly, Mr Educated Economist. 
The example person already had 1 BTC and no more. The value changed against the dollar, because the dollar was becoming more worthless over time. Nobody was taking money out of the supply. In fact what was happening was that money was being spent (which of course you didn't see at all because you are too wedded to the idea that anyone who saves never spends). Money was being used in to buy bigger and better things without destroying the individual's savings.  
If you can't see that then you, as an economist, are more out of touch with reality than we feared.

Or the other scenario is that at some point the price does not rise until enough time passes to go back to your predictions. I've seen the same types of calculations, and you are probably correct in the dates based on past adoptions.
But markets ALWAYS want to get the prices they can get now, and don't wait until they are expected. When the market knows ahead of time what to expect, it goes out and gets it. That's why quarterly reports are secret until they aren't. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:03:47
i think you need to read a bit more about transaction inputs and outputs. You have made some big assumptions that are not strictly the case: "Someone that holds lots of bitcoins" is not exactly a big bag of money. 
I could hold a substantial amount as unspent transactions on multiple addresses that do not have a private key stored on any computing device. You would not be able to determine that it was mine, and even if I decided I would spend a tiny portion of it, I would make sure the change went to a whole new address. 
What then?

I had to watch 28 minutes before the punch line came:  look out for this one, it's probably the most important point: "when debt and borrowing are 1:1"... What is the ratio now, and given the laughable "solution" (raising income faster than debt, in case you didn't see it) how on earth can this be done unless you massively print more money... Which as the video was kind enough to admit gives us a huge headache with inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:23:29


That's easy to answer.
Some are, but changing a whole monetary system is going to take a long time - it needs infrastructure, and there are literally thousands of people all working on this. It will take a considerable amount of time, so you can't expect people to just use it from day 1. That's unrealistic.
Again, if you had bothered to look at any of the adoption data you would have seen that it is right on the curve, where it should be today. Maybe it's speculation to say one way or the other, except that if it is successful it is already doing what is expected of it by all measures. Maybe we find a bug tomorrow. maybe we don't. If we find a bug, then by the way, your fiat bank account won't be safe either, so let's hope that we don't.

I don't think you understand what is involved with mining and what the benefits are. 
Today the benefits might be the reward for finding blocks, and the transaction fees.
In future you will receive all the transaction fees in the block and little reward, but long before the coins are mined out, bitcoin transaction numbers will be huge, therefore the fees will at some point overtake the reward for finding the block.
That's the design.

I always find this discussion rather odd, here's why.
Mining a block means achieving the required hash, by incrementing the nonce until it is found. At any time a miner could include a new transaction that it receives and start over.
The chances of being first to find the hash, with or without the new transaction are exactly the same. Therefore if 10 new transactions with no fees are added and it just so happens that this achieves the required hash quicker, the miner will still be rewarded the same fee.
It could be argued that transactions without fees should never be included, but not all miners would agree that, therefore they will still be competing on the same level with other miners who accept no fee transactions. It will never be the case that all miners accept only no fee transactions, but it might be the case that the majority do not accept no fee transactions. But I can't see all miners rejecting no fee transactions for the reasons above.

Bitcoin is a currency. When you say "invest" you need to understand what your aims are. Do you "invest" in Euros when you go to Europe? Or are you "investing in Yen" when you travel to Japan? Are you really "investing" when buying another currency?
What I'm trying to do is a little bit of education. BTC exists for a reason and that reason is so that it can be used as a currency. The fact that it also has properties that make Fiat currencies go down in value against it, does not make it "an investment" - it merely highlights the problems that the other currencies have in retaining actual value.
I do however recommend to my friends that they buy at least 1 bitcoin and if they want, I will buy them back off the person that does *if* they no longer want them. 
If you see Bitcoin as a hedge against your own currency crashing against bitcoin, then by all means buy BTC as an "investment". Other than that buy BTC because you want to spend it now or later.

From what I've heard it cannot be done when you do not have a specific type of historical data - or not enough of historical data to map the curve. You could have tried when it was $8, you may have been right, but it would have been a lucky guess.
We now have nearly 5 years of accurate historical data, which is significantly more. Once you are able to tweak the calculation you are able to draw a curve that matches the reality, barring future disasters. I have heard this has been true for every study of every subject product or service since the calculation was created 50+ years ago. So who am I to argue?
To answer your question about the price in November 2013. Well normally it should be $256, which means that at some point in the near future it will reach that. It may not be exactly November because the market has to catch up with the curve and here is the explanation I got: 
This has been observed the whole way... the target price is set by the curve (which does not adjust for market fluctuations) so when the market goes down and loses sync, it rebounds back up to where it should have been on the curve and then continues on. It's quite impressive to see. 
Last November it was supposed to be $74, but that did not happen until March, by which time the curve said it should have been $112. OK it was late, but there was a huge jump in April and by May 2013 the price had settled back down not to where it was before, but where it should have been on the curve: the curve and the price were back in sync. 
The price fell back again, the curve continued, and then a jump happened again to bring them back in sync. This has been observed many times over the years. The price tracking the predicted curve that's all he's observing, and the curve is not calculated from the price, it is calculated from other non-market related data which makes it all the more interesting.

It's a personal view but i think markets are "reactionary" although they do tend to react quickly, and whatever might be said about bear and bull markets, traders are like gamblers - forever optimistic of making money whichever way the market turns.
Given that you wouldn't be surprised if I say that traders and economists are not the same thing. Economists can be optimistic or pessimistic it makes no difference to them. Economists obviously try to be objective, and realistic, and I would hope, much like scientists try to eliminate bias in their data.
@_date: 2013-09-24 05:43:21
I think money supply is 5-6 trillion USD which makes the ratio only slightly "better". The point is that difference is continually growing on the debt side, and you'd have to print up so much money to control the debt that hyper-inflation is built in. 
I just think the video skips over dealing with the figures in real terms. Thus painting a false and rosy picture.

So what you are telling me is that if you had 1000$ that turned into $1000,000 you would still keep it in the bank? OK fine for you but I think most people would take some of that ability to spend and do what comes naturally. 
In fact that happens every day all around me. People drive expensive cars buy expensive handbags. That's the world I live in. Maybe not you. You think people hoard in spite of the evidence to the contrary.


You just answered your own question. It's the printing of money which causes inflation I think we can agree. That's what most other currencies are currently doing, and so in relation to something that holds its value well those currencis are going to become more worthless.
I site the Euro example because it is the most recent example of a new currency being introduced widely. It provides exactly the comparisons needed to understand how Bitcoin could become more widespread, and the effect it would have on their values.
BTW it is the ECB (European Central Bank) that manages the Euro. The Germans do have a big say in that though.

I know you are trying to explain it to me, thanks, but I just don't get how my debt gets paid using ripple. Person A owes Person B 100 Ripple. Person A cannot pay person B. Does some person C arrive and pay it instead? Doesn't that mean that Person A now owes person C? Good luck to person C because they will never get their money... unless person D etc.. etc...
The point is that the debt is never eliminated as long as Person A does not pay.
If you are saying it's all OK because Person B never had the money to start with then this is crazy!

I don't disagree if you are using encryption on top of your memorable info before generating private key.
I was making the point that what you seemed to be suggesting was a memorable but "apparently obscure" 58 character key, which for the sake of clarity could be dictionary cracked if it was anything like I described. Just a warning to others.
Incidentally dictionary cracking is pretty easy these days as there are huge resources out there (Wikipedia for one) which have been phrase indexed and are surprisingly good at cracking.

In a word: no.
Re-read the article - carefully.
It doesn't say that the encryption itself has been broken. It is more likely that the PC's back door has been opened from time to time - ie a compromised PC would not be safer just because it encrypts the messages or whatnot and this is more like what they are saying. Nothing is new here.

This sentiment is spot on, we just have to make sure that we don't alienate people by being too high minded. I also have friends and colleagues who bury their heads in the sand over the coming debt crisis, because they simply don't understand what money really is.
This makes me think that we are in a time similar to that before WWII when Jews who saw it coming got luckily out of Germany and went go elsewhere, others thought it would never happen.  You cannot convince everybody, and you just have to leave them to their own fate, however harsh it unfair that may seem.

You can get rid of the need to work, by replacing it with the will to work. That is an entirely different concept.
Like I said we are not going to agree if you insist that debt is necessary (because of the past history of the world) and I say we now have a different system that didn't exist before. 
There isn't anything more to discuss, and only time will tell who is "correct".
What I don't understand is your inability to even think about a world without debt. You seem to be repeating the mantra.
I'm pro Bitcoin or whatever comes next that's better than Bitcoin. Most if not all of your "argument" stems from the refusal to accept that Bitcoin is viable. I don't know if you are a supporter or an detractor. It's just not clear.
Of course there won't be evidence for something new. That what new means by definition. But you can imagine what it would be like, even if it turns out to be wrong. I do t have a problem with either, what's your view?

I always find this argument to be shortsighted and irrelevant in the long run.
When the euro was introduced nobody worried about converting it physically back into the old currency even though both were in circulation. Instead when they received euros they just spent them because they were accepted everywhere.
Replace the word Euro in the above paragraph with Bitcoin. The ATM works as designed - for a future where Bitcoin is the currency of choice.

My question exactly. I sent money back on the 8th October, I had my bank confirm 3 times that the money had arrived, firstly they refused to credit my account, then when I eventually received the swift payment message from my bank and sent it to them they agreed to credit the account. At that point I thought it was ok.
I bought into the market, and I already had some BTC sitting on the account, transferred 99BTC out (daily limit 100 BTC) all arrived OK, next day - account blocked.
Reason: banks required ID. So I sent ID passport, Tax Bill
The refused again requesting Company information but didn't state what exactly they needed so I sent Company Incorporation Certificate, SWIFT message again, proof that I am a company director.
Still nothing, it's nearly 3 weeks since all this began.

Yes this does make sense but, we are talking about some time a very long way in the future... 2140 to be precise. So there's not much to worry about right now.
Until then miners will still receive rewards. Until then the "difficulty" will self adjust.
We probably will see a split in the mining community... those who only accept fee bearing transactions (the majority of miners I imagine) and those who don't. 
In any case even today there is a minimum fee calculation which can, and likely will, be changed by subsequent updates in the codebase.

This is just plain wrong. The scarcity comes from the future limit being 21 million coins, just like there is a limit to physical amounts of gold. The scarcity does not come from savings.


Are you kidding me? What planet do you live on? *Most people* don't have any savings at all, bitcoin at least gives them a chance of having something of value in the future. But you don't want that do you?


I write programs which analyse swaps for a living. The problem you have is that you cannot foresee a future where there is only one currency and the advantage that would have for all concerned. I'm talking business that hate the fact that they lose money on swaps at all. They get upset and people get fired over stuff that is not under their control. Give them an answer to this problem (which bitcoin is) and they will bite your hand off.


No. I am observing the fact that its value is relative to the falling value of all other currencies which are designed to become more worthless with time. Bitcoin is stable from my perspective. Just like the every day European does not see fluctuations of the Euro against the Dollar. Once you are in that currency the other currencies do not matter.


I admit there might be a change of balance of financial power. It may come as a shock to those who hold all the fiat cash now, and ridicule bitcoin, and it is why I tell everyone I know who has little or no money, to buy at least 1 Bitcoin. I also offer to buy it back off them at the market price if they no longer want it.


This is clearly total nonsense. You have never run a profitable business in your life, whereas I have, for the last 25 years. If you had you would know that making money in business is all about making sure your competition is not winning business that you want, and where your suppliers are beaten down on price for your company's gain.
But for the sake of completeness buying bitcoin is not an investment, in the same way as withdrawing cash from an ATM is not an investment. Bitcoin is like cash, but it also has the store of value like gold.

It is a little bit more complex than this. I am the OP, but putting dollars into an interest earning savings account, is not quite the same thing.
The bank takes your money and uses it for it's own purposes and you become a creditor. You have invested in the bank, just like buying shares in a company - and there is no guarantee whatsoever that you will be able to get your money out again.
The only reason why you can get your money out is because other people are not all asking at the same time.
On top of that the bank gives you the impression that you are making money by paying you interest. 
However if the bank is broke, as most of them are, then your original capital is potentially lost if everyone asks for their money at once. You can make your own mind up about this system being a Ponzi Scheme or not, but Bitcoin is deflationary simply because other moneys are crashing in value against it.

People are keeping their coins, that's what is stopping it. You can't have a market drop significantly if nobody is selling. 
If you had between 1000 and 2000 coins you could affect the price but it would be a blip. In order to make it significant you'd have to do it over and over again for quite a while.

No Bitcoins cannot be tracked to an IP. The IP that you might see on BlockChain.info is not your IP but the IP of the relaying node on the network. 
There have been studies that show that you can link addresses to the same "enclosure", thereby implying that unspent coins in those addresses are owned by the same person, but like others have said, unless at least one of those public keys is publicly associated to you personally then it is difficult to make that connection.

Yes but the implication was that somehow putting a gun to your head was different with Bitcoin.
Arguably the reason why the feds have not seized the SR millions is the answer, (whatever that might be), but agreed, users want easy.
It is an illusion that banks offer you protection - they absolutely don't - they'll make a genuine claim unbelievably difficult to process, and they don't care about you because you are just one in a million.
It is not correct to place this illusion on to bitcoin as if it is faulty. When you use Bitcoin you have to understand that with the power, comes greater responsibility. That is a question of education.

If Bitcoin reaches $10 000 the game will be over for the Dollar already. It's a bit irrelevant to talk about a future value being in the $250 000 range (although that is likely to be the case if Bitcoin replaces cash), in order to make mining worth it, because it has always been foreseen that transaction fees will in the long run be the money spinner for miners.

I wonder if it's because of the involvement of "the establishment" 
the BTC London event was attended by people interested in doing the things that money markets and bankers have been doing. To me this is counter productive an almost certainly against the spirit of satoshi.
It would be far better to work on products that take Bitcoin mainstream. We never had money markets when we were trading shells, an it seems a shame to let short term gamblers dominate the ecosystem 
I was hugely saddened to see the winklevoss brothers  create an money market product rather than use their  position and wealth for the good of the community by investing more into it. Instead it looks like they just want to impress their already wealthy friends with their new toy.
We don't need this and I wonder if many are basically getting out because the establishment is getting in.
Personally I hope the establishment gets bored waiting for Bitcoin to rise, and then pulls out. It won't be pretty, but at least we'll get our currency back.
