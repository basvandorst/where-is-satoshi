I bought in 2015, so I am probably most like this guy.
My gains are high, I sold enough to be profitable. Now I HODL with the rest.
I've watched BTC go down to 250 dollars, up to 800 and back to 400. Those 50% swings were huge to myself. At some point, I stopped  watching the price and just kept the Bitcoin.
Glad I did.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:52:49
There wasnt a point when they forked. Another pump and dump alt-coin.
Ethereum, LTC, Monero were significantly better than BCH.
I wont be putting any money in a Bitcoin based alt-coin. Bitcoin is flawed, why would anyone copy paste it? Ethereum, Monero, and others use their own technology.

Its Fraud. 
That is an attack. 
How'd you feel about buying a nice Pixel cellphone, only to find out the store you bought it from wasnt giving you Google's Pixel.
Instead you get a Chinese 'Google Pixel'. Looks the same on the outside, very slow phone, no updates, and google will not offer their support.
Fraud is an attack. This is very important.

Thats how much youd need for your proposal.
You cant just buy 20,000 BTC either, because that would cause the price to go up.

I took a round of profits this time. But if someone lost, HODL.

They are worried that stupid people are going to lose lots of money.
I warned my friends about alt-coin mania a few weeks ago, despite me having thousands in alt-coins.
I'm warning them because they might do dumb things like put 10,000$ in IOTA instead of 500$ in all of the top 20 cryptos. 
They are warning us, so we don't move a bunch of BTC in a single transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:54:49
some reddit bot remind us in 1 or 2 years, that way when BTC hits ATHs and dips again we can spare us from these comments.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:49:54
This is why I started selling my alt coins.
These alt coins do not have Trust. They are pump and dump schemes with very few exceptions.
Only Ethereum has proved themselves because they actually failed for a hot second with CryptoKitties. But then again, I dont trust ethereum's leadership.
Its going to be a crazy world for crypto in 2018. I expect half the top 10 to be nearly worthless.
Bitcoin is the only original.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:52:02
Did this, overdrafted 300$ on Ethereum.
It worked out pretty well for me.

What banks let you do this?
I can only imagine those people have fantastic credit.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:03:05
Its a hedge against government currency.
Also, the dozens of others are significantly more risky.
Every year alt coins disappear to Zero. 
Bitcoin, and the bitcoin blockchain has survived 9 years and grew. Bitcoin will survive. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:08:44

Yes! 
So in march 2017, I bought more BTC and more ETH. 
I knew by November, I was going to need to make multiple major purchases since we were moving into a house.
ETH went down to 200$/coin, BTC hovered. Then in December I sold some.
Just like I planned a half year ago.
EDIT: I should mention our household income is 200k/year. We had put a 100k downpayment on the home. Even if BTC went away, I could've paid off the credit card in 2 months max.

BCH is probably going to 0. All other hard forks have.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:28:41
This is why non-bitcoin altcoins are mania. Stocks actually provide investment to companies. 
The purpose of Cryptocurrency is to reduce the cost of transactions. Outside of that, blockchain isnt providing significant value.
Yes, moving money is an extremely expensive problem, but alt-coins are hyping up the Coin/USD conversion, not the problem solving solutions.
This is a bull run and excitement. Outside Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, and litecoin(if ethereum is jammed)- **I don't see any other alt coin currently solving problems.**
If it solves problems, your cryptocurrency is better than a stock in 2018. 
If your cryptocurrency is a white paper thats 3 months old... I got bad news.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:57:46
Its not a gabaillion because it does tend toward 0.
1k at 90% loaned= 900$
900$ at 90% is= 810$
810 at 90%= 730$
So by the end of  this, you get a non infinite number as it converges. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:11:17


If anyone is thinking this to themselves, you should probably sell most your crypto.
Leave the alt-coin investment to people who have seen 8 years of shitcoins become worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:50:52
If no one told their friends about bitcoin, no one could ever use it....

Fraud protection.
Bitcoin Cash trying to act like Bitcoin is intended to mislead people.
So people who have a 1500$ alt coin can trick people into thinking its Bitcoin, and BCH people can sell to people who don't know the difference.
Its important to keep Bitcoin running under Bitcoin Blockchain, Bitcoin. 
If Bitcoin Cash wants to split, let them, don't try to mislead and trick people.

There is a coinbase to bitcoin debit card that can fix this problem for you.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:52:17
When coinbase let us at our BCH, the price hit 4k but you werent allowed to sell.
Used shapeshift to go from BCH to litecoin and cashed out at 4k/coin.
The litecoin moved fine, finding someone to trade Litecoin for BCH... not so much...
Took almost an hour. Only reason I posted was because BTC and ETH are the coins used in exchanges. People arent using BCH like BTC.

These people rely on bitcoin users for value. Bitcoin needs to solve problems.

Stocks have investment. Thats why they are valuable. 
Buying Apple Shares give Apple money to invest into their company.
Cryptocurrency does not have this value generation EXCEPT FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS. Bitcoin holds value, so that solves a problem. Ether has smart contracts, that solves a problem. Monero is untracable, that solves problems. 
Alt coins that are random, big promise coins, that havent been able to solve problems are going to be dumped.

Bitcoin is literally 10 times bigger than nearly every crypto. Ethereum is the only one that even comes close. Trying to get the entire world to buy-in is impossible. 
I have no Bitcoin Cash from by 2 btc in CirclePay. 
Most exchanges don't have BCH pairings(BCH shills will tell you that you can convert to BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR- but thats because BTC, ETH, LTC, and XMR are major, not Bitcoin Cash)
A random old dude at work said he bought Bitcoin today. He definitely didnt buy bitcoin cash.

Ahh I got it. (libertarian that loves BTC's digital gold here)
Do you have any opinions on the technology of smart contracts? 
That was my reason.

Stop following Bitcoin.
Wait 2 years and you will be happy.

Eh, Bitcoin can store long term value.
The other cryptos can move money. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:49:06
When Bitcoin hits 100k, the 50 dollar fee will feel petty.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:29:39
I expect a 100k bitcoin by 2019. 
All these shit-alt coins are going to die. People will realize that bitcoin is rare, ethereum is useful, and monero is hard to trace. 
I bought in a 200$. Does my opinion become more valuable?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:15:30






Left my name, phone number, and address. Took about 45 seconds. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:21:48
That was fun. 
Almost as much fun as it was to sell that shitcoin at 4,000$/coin.
First and only time I actually was glad coinbase sucked.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:14:55


I converted it to BTC the moment coinbase let me. Sold it at ~4k.

Okay, but that doesnt make it any less rare.

Agreed, the attempted Fraud to take over the bitcoin name is worth defending.
Nerds messing around on  BTC is massive compared to the few people that still are holding BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:40:49
Eh, I love BTC, but not diversifying is risky. 
But it also depends on how much you have. I have more than 6 figures in crypto. If you have 300$, I would say to throw it 90% in BTC

@_date: 2018-01-31 15:47:59
I got my Bitcoin years ago, I used a credit card that charged a 3 or 5% fee.
It was outrageous right? Why not hook up your bank account and get 0 fee?
Well it was convenient, I have a little bit more protection on a credit card if my number is stolen. Whatever.
Well, that 50$ I paid in fees to buy Bitcoin years ago seems petty to the value today. 
Ethereum is the more common way of sending money quickly and cheap, Bitcoin is digital gold and exists as a hedge against Fiat currency.

I was at a party where me and 1 other dude had been in the game for a long time.
Someone asked me about Litecoin and BCH. Since I didnt have to worry about downvotes, I said something like-
"Now what I'm going to say is very contraversial on the internet, but I also believe it...
BCH and Litecoin are Shitcoins that might not even fix all of bitcoins problems.
Sold my BCH to some poor sucker for 4k"
My other crypto buddy was dying because he never heard someone trash talk of shitcoins

It doesnt even need to be for beginners. 
Coinbase has held my bitcoin since 2011. During that time, I forgot my password and lost my phone for 2 step authentication.
I still have my bitcoin.
I cant imagine trying to keep a cold wallet hidden, secure, and not catch fire.
If you want to know? I trust my money at a bank more than under my bed. I'll mention I keep my money at multiple banks/exchanges due to things like this.

Hard to say, I had a buddy ask me to buy him a bitcoin when he was in a country that was hostile(UAE IIRC). 
I told him no, taxes suck. He said, buy 2 bitcoin, keep 1. 
1 year later the 'fee' he paid feels petty.

**Bitcoin forks are as old as Litecoin**
BCH is another fork. 
I don't really care either way, but I wouldnt spend a penny on BCH. Bitcoin forks historically fail.
I worry that BCH is going to cause some crypto drama where Your Mom buys Bitcoin and expects to have BCH. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:19:36
I warn all of my friends about BCH. 
Just use ethereum, or litecoin.

At least diversify. But definitely dont sucker your friends into buying shitcoins.

What state?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:46:46
Straight from ADP
Gross 2080$. Taxes 539.9$
I put a deduction of 3 so I could use cash today for investments. I always pay about 3-5k in April. 
Including this deduction, taxes are 25%
My yearly income is ~80,000 after taxes.
We pay about $15,000 in property tax. 
Now, how did you get that I'm only paying 25%?
This didnt include 6% sales tax, gas tax, capital gains tax, alcohol tax. 
So, use simple math and tell me how much I pay per year.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:52:05
Simple people simple pleasures.
I'd rather have 6 interns work for me than sit in a small car in traffic.

Yes. That has been made clear.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:51:27
I used shapeshift to get my shitcoin out at 4,000$.
But unfortunately I used a different shitcoin LTC which dropped at the same time period.
I was worried about the ETH log jam or I wouldve used that.
Literally 30 minutes after I made the trade BCH went down to 2500
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:28:32
Yes haha. Made about 15k. (sold both Eth and BTC late december)
Although, I'm not sure when I'm going to buy again. Might just realize those gains and spend it on some home improvements.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:21:28
80% of my money is in crypto, I dont feel its responsible to buy more, even if I believe in it.

Heh, I do that too. Buying tech and writing it off.
I havent written off my home mortgage for my business though. 
I'm in the weird process of trying to get  1million dollars so I can avoid fees on a mutual fund(for my next business), so I'm also extremely frugal and risky on crypto.

Depends on the crypto, Bitcoin works well especially v bitcoin cash and ethereum. 
Ripple? I think the 20B in premining makes the market cap useless.

How does this work with taxes?
You sell your BTC for USD? Then pay tax on that?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:33:00
Imagine I have a gigantic wallet that has my entire families bitcoin being held.
My website marks who has what bitcoin. Then we can trade between ourselves without many fees.
This is similar, people are taking their money, putting it into an 'off chain' psudo-website/server, and moving it through there.
It still requires an 'on chain' transaction to turn back into USD(at the current time).
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:18:43

This was much needed IMO.
Alt-crypto pump and dumps will die like Tron and the 1000 other bullshit alt-coins.
Out of the ashes, I expect a much smarter community. Less crypto-mania. More HODL and people actually caring about solving problems.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:25:49


Eh, I think the US is too corrupt to say that. Especially medical:
Even if you tried your dream, Physicians, Hospitals, and Pharmacists would unite to take advantage and increase their own monopoly.
I agree the costs are crazy, but after seeing how Medical is already corrupt, I worry more laws will only make it worse.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:48:24


That's outdated. Ethereum a few years ago wasnt supposed to be a currency. However, with BTC and the market demand, it has become a currency.

@_date: 2018-01-29 16:10:13
There have been many hardforks. This means someone copy pasted the code, all original users get BCH... except I had mine in CirclePay, so  I'll never get BCH.
This is basically why 100% of Bitcoin hardforks have failed.

Mt Gox was because the biggest exchange got hacked.

Bitcoin owners need to be proud that they own some bitcoin.
You own 1 btc? That is HUGE given there are 7 billion humans in the world.

BCH obviously hasnt replaced bitcoin or become the next gen solution for transactions.

Even if Zimbabwae undergoes a military coup and the new government prints money, you still have Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is heavy to move like Gold, but it stores value. Maybe with new technology we will find faster and lower cost ways to move this gold, but the rarity exists.

As a 200-300 level buyer, this is not what I'm doing.
My family mentioned 'You must be freaking out about bitcoin'
Why? What happened? Oh it went down 10%? That isnt news.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:05:34
The solid ones will. But EOY 2015 and EOY 2017 are night and day different.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:54:27
Pretty similar here.
Bitcoin is great to hedging against fiat, but not great for moving money. Ethereum has almost instant peer to peer transfers.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:45:25
BTC is valued for the rare number. Its like buying a shitty gucci purse, but it still says Gucci
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:04:31
Everything that happened with Coinbase and BCH is fine in my opinion.
BCH losers deserve to suffer. I sold my shitcoin cash for $4,000 using shapeshift the moment I got access.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:24:42
If it gets to 7,000$/coin. I'm buying more.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:13:07
I know I am. People on reddit have a hard time believing there are 4%ers shitposting too.
I also didnt mention that I'm expecting to be double taxed next year(because we are small business owners).
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:12:28
BTC is still the universal trading pair.
Shitcoin Cash was celebrating being able to buy DASH lol

I want out of coinbase and into a segwit exchange that I can quickly convert to USD or ETH if needed. 
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:29:11


Roger Ver, can you get out shitcoins out of Circle? I know entire groups of people that refuse BCH because it never got consensus.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:50:23


To be fair, Bitcoin is 4000% bigger than monero. Bitcoin doesnt have unified leadership, its very decentralized. 
(Note: I have a ton of Monero)
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:51:03
I'm 100% convinced when people say 'Buy a lambo or Tesla'
Its marketing teams on reddit acting like people buy petty luxuries. (This is basically confirmed for anything Elon, but its a conspiracy for Lambo)
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:54:52
Ethereum is led by a skinny russian, Bitcoin is decentralized.
Ethereum has had 100% of its hard forks work.
Bitcoin has had 0% of its hard forks work(since satoshi left us)
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:48:01
No, but you should be skeptical they are.
Only a few alt coins will survive. Look at last years alt coins.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:36:53
Other crypto probably wont store value.
In the 7 years I've followed crypto, the only ones that are still around are Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash(Dark Coin). 
Litecoin would give me hope, but no one develops for litecoin. Dash has bad management.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:44:48


As long as you have a hard wallet + military dictators, I expect that you can always convert BTC to USD.
Might have to pay taxes so a dictator can buy more guns, but you only need 1 country to accept BTC to their currency to USD.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:22:43
I'm about to convert 30% of my alt coins to bitcoin. LN doesnt need to have instant transactions, it simply needs to make bitcoin usable again.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:27:57
Fees will be what LN decides.
It should significantly cut down on the blockchain traffic. If nothing else, on chain transactions should go down too.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:44:14


On alt-coins
Bitcoin is a 200B industry. Good luck getting bill gates to help you buy enough bitcoin to make a dent.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:02:41
Stop saying that.
You need to provide an alternative in your sentence if you tell people to stop using it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:52
If it gets back to 4,000, I'll max out 3 credit cards haha
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:54:58
Strangely the free market seems most adapted by the civilized world.
I suppose a controlled economy might be appealing to religious fanatics in the middle east.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:29:00
My thoughts exactly. 30$ of bitcoin cost me a few pennies a few years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:58
Hahaha I probably shouldnt be talking about things so generically.
I'm banking 8k/mo, and have 150k in various savings. I might be a bit weird.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:00:59
Yep, and BTC being scarce is what provides its value.
Bitcoin forks like BCH and BGold and BDiamond Batom and all other shitforks are people making money off the fools that don't understand the rarity gives it value.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:57:50
My friends, who have been asking me about crypto since december, are talking of selling. (or did sell)
They didnt hear me when I said HODL Bitcoin. Although, I probably said this daily.
Its not even a lot of money, these cats put ~$150 in. 
These humans are the ones that buy high and sell low.
If you want to see  who the losers are, the ones that cannot wait.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:07:52


Those that are HODLing it.


Because we don't need multiple types of currency that solve the same problem. Having to build a separate infrastructure for BCH is a non-trivial issue.
It has nothing to do with me and you, and everything to do with developers. Developers already picked BTC, ETH, and Monero.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:59:14


I have for-profit projects, and non profit projects. I spend about 70 hours a week working, but I still get taxed half my income between federal, state, medicare, medicaid, local property tax. Its insane.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:02:32
Are we the same person?
Also, thats how long I can wait for bitcoin. Probably exaggerating about credit cards. I'm banking 8k/month, so worst case I can have it paid back in 2 months.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:05:44
Google/youtube it?
There are plenty of smart people that study this with answers to your questions.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:10:45
Lol this is my families yearly reminder to 
"Sell my bitcoin now"
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:47:37
Sounds like this is your personal problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:07:33
The wealthy have massive bitcoin NOW.
Its their wealth that has been transferred  into nerdy libertarian early adopters.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:24:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:36:50
It will cause a massive political dillema, but I dont see it taking down states.
Corporations are already investing in bitcoin.
Old people will be the only losers.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:18:49
Its not perfect, but it definitely works for the purpose you mentioned.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:30:24
Its very rare and people have valued it for 9 years.
Its arbitrary.
I agree with the transaction problem though
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:13:16
Eh, you are proposing a future that is far too crazy to predict.
I could post the same thing and change the numbers and it would be just as valid.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:34


Is it that short?
My family was aristocrats about 200-300 years ago. Everyone in my family is a 6 figure earner in professional fields. I dont think it necessarily has to do with being 'millionaires' 200 years ago, but I'm sure it had some impact.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:30:04
Soo, I'm not sure what original point you were trying to make.
I've found crypto to be both useful, lucrative, and oddly Fun.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:39:27
Things arent black and white.
The fact that nerds have received a massive influx of wealth is good for everyone. The old aristocracy lost wealth by being late to the bitcoin party.
There has and will be some improvement.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:02:42
It got popular. Popularity kills the fun.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:35:04
I don't. I'm frugal?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:35
Not all, but those that didn't get involved until its too late will have massively inflated USD.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:27:53
I'm planning on doing similar for 2018.
I have lost faith in Fiat currency and want to make the change to 50% bitcoin holdings for my cash. 40% in Ethereum, and 10% USD.
Bitcoin is a fantastic hedge against the dollar IMO.
Ethereum will be great for me to send money to friends.
Cash will be good to pay off monthly credit cards and mortgages.
Obviously the dream would be to get everything in bitcoin and pay everything in bitcoin. Will someone make a 'bitcoin debit card'?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:11:51
I'd spend my bitcoin, but it is too expensive for a transaction.
Id spend my ethereum in december 2017.  Both of these are the same type of solution IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:52:36
Neither of these are mutually exclusive. The only reason my friends accepted it was because it stored value.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:42:40
Bernie didnt have $500,000,000,000 of financial backing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:04:24

Kids like me put 500 dollars in and its worth 100k today. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:07
Don't underestimate the military.
But I mostly agree.
What we need is the aristocrats to buy in too.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:05:10
This isnt Zero sum because bitcoin solves problems.
However, outside of that, its a wealth transfer from late adoptors to early adoptors. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:36:04
EVERYONE LISTEN TO HIM
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:04:52
Nothing, its risky.
What if you buy for 17200 and bitcoin is worth 13000 tomorrow?
For non bitcoin currencies, I believe manipulation is a real thing. For Bitcoin, its so freaking big that single movers have almost no power.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:28:04
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:09:28
Most credit card is 20%, so yeah, its not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:35:42
For clarification-
I fully bought/paid off the crypto in March. 
In November I made 20,000 dollars in credit card expenses for a brand new house under the full expectation that I'd be selling the crypto I bought in march.
This was all planned in march, so I didn't take off an exchange because I was planning on selling.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:48:45
Yeah don't get me wrong, still glad I got it. Just wanted to let people know about the AOL of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:13:53
Coinbase to coinbase is instant.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:35:14
And you are taking risk.
Bitcoin owners are risk takers, ooo the revolution has a good demographic...
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:15:48
You cant really affect either.
But the Yen can hyper-inflate.
Bitcoin cannot.
By the time Bill gates or golden sachs try to buy enough bitcoin to mess up the price, the price would skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:37:34
Eh, until bitcoin is worth tens of trillions of dollars, I worry the government will either tax or ban the hell out of it.
"To the moon" gets us closer to this critical mass needed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:41
Ive paid friends for hotels, protein powder, and more using bitcoin.
They are all very happy about being paid in bitcoin rather than USD.
If you arent using cryptocurrency, you are simply a late adoptor.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:12:41
Not a happy ending yet, but happy so far. I was going to sell 3 bitcoin at 7,000 to pay off the credit card. haha
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:19:51
I agree.
But I think you are underestimating why people value bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:03
That isnt how currency works. Its literally to facilitate trade.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:32
Libertarian An-cap here:
I want us to stop talking about cryptocurrency as the solution to Fiat currency.
If I know the government, a few individuals have the power to ban it. If the government loses power over money, they will have a crisis.
**Right now, I think we should be pushing the TO THE MOON narrative until enough people are invested that the government cannot stop us**
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:42:04


If bitcoin cant solve this, we will simply go back to traditional means of moving money for bitcoin. Remember that a piece of paper with numbers on it does the job too. That can be sent via email for free.
Consolidating to a single wallet is annoying though.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:09:56
This doesnt solve peer to peer transactions.
I'm main bitcoin, but what currencies do you like for peer to peer(goal is easy app, easy to buy, easy to move)
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:50:27
Hate coin base for other reasons, they are a payment service. Capitalism, go use another for your horrible website.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:43:53
Its completely not needed. We already have bitcoin.
If you bought it from coinbase in 2017, I got bad news. You were part of the pump and dump.
Prior to that even LTC was laughed out of basically any crypto discussion. Just as flawed as bitcoin, but fools gold.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:42:34
I thought the shift card was blocked
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:09:22
Lol sorry apple fanboys
Not really sorry, Apple is a closed company, you knew you were limited to the Apple store, and yet you got an iphone...
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:43:20
Find any company that accepts crypto, its always been hit and miss. Always.
The fees are a new problem, but after shapeshifting to LTC and deciding to HODL it only to lose 25% of its value vs BTC. I'm never trusting an alt-coin to hold value.
With LN, I imagine the adaptation will be incredible. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:39:34
I dont know about square, but I already have a debit card attached to a bank account.
That bank account is attached to an exchange.
Sounds like its very similar.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:05:07
It already works, but we need programmers to build applications for it.
We need Lightning Network readers for stores, Lightning Network wallets, and exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:22:48
Lol looked  at your post history. what are you doing here? BCH isnt bitcoin and you dont own Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:51:42
I flipped through your account. 
Do you own any BTC? or are you some FUD promoter? 
Like I couldnt figure out your angle, but I cant understand why you are on unless you are just trolling. But I also dont understand why people waste time trolling.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:54:44
Why ETH? I own 30 ETH, but I'm not a big fan of a currency that doesnt have a limit yet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:49:52
Blockchain is good for keeping BTC scarce and tracked. But its awful for the environment.
For this reason BCash and Litecoin will fail too. Gen 2 coins will be nice to reduce environmental impact, but will be run by companies with their own motives. 
The thing that makes BCash and litecoin significantly worse is that they arent gold, they are fools gold. They can be traded, but no one values it like gold. With LN, we found a way to move gold significantly cheaper.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:32:18
lol no
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:40:04


Welcome to Cryptocurrency
Also, speaking of crashing, [BCH is down 30% vs Bitcoin.]( 
Its not the technology causing the crash, its Cryptocurrency in general...
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:04:56
Yep, I know plenty of people that still think its 'too hard' to get bitcoin. The people willing to put up with coinbase shit will benefit.
Wait until companies offer 1% discounts for using Bitcoin instead of a credit card.
There is a reason BTC appreciates, people are getting closer to real world adaptation. Bitcoin ATMs are all over my city now, and those that were willing to link their bank account with a strange website years ago made 1000%+.
As bitcoin gets easier to get and use, the ROI goes down for new investors. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:40:09
Litecoin has no purpose, it only exists because coinbase had insider trading. Charlie cashed out after the pump.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:44:55
They also arent fire-proof.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:57:20

Layer 2 is the next gen thing that needs to happen with Crypto. Thats more than just LN. We have been seeing this with Bitcoin ETFs for years.
Some alt cryptos have a goal to remove this, and I wish them luck. However outside ethereum, most alt-coins are too tiny to care about.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:02:25
I'm about to get rid of half my ETH after realizing this again.
No cap on coins but insane mining... 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:29:50
Yeah but these cryptonoobies post on reddit and facebook. They have no clue whats going on, and we have no clue whos seen BTC and alt coins during 2013-2015.
After joining a facebook group where people believe in LTC, I'm convinced that I no longer trust the internet again. For a minute I did.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:27:50
If bitcoin falls under $1000 I'll get worried.
Until then we are still crushing November numbers which is fun. 
Do these people not know how Cryptocurrency has worked? Nothing new here.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:10:36
thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:23:03
Is this easier than selling BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:33:58
Yes we shouldnt use this.
Very confusing.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:46:19
Keep cash on hand low, liquid assets high.
Sell when needed, the fact that you are aware is fantastic.
Its the people that dont understand inflation that will be burned.

There isnt that many places that accept it yet. This isnt new to crypto, this is the problem with emerging technologies.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:01:52
"This is good for bitcoin" existed back when Bitcoin was unheard of. Talking about the digital currency was free advertising, good or bad. Donald Trump style.
Now that bitcoin is known worldwide, FUD hurts the coin.
Although I know many people that refused to buy a 10k bitcoin, I had 2 friends contact me on how to get involved in crypto since the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:56:12
Monero is not a crappy gen 1 coin. Monero is different and has a different purpose.
Litecoin is literally Bitcoin x4.

Underrated post.
This was the true vision of Bitcoin lmao
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:18
The next all time high will be at 20k...
So if you buy now, you can sell... at an all-time-high.
Maybe you dont sell all, but you can sell some.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:19:34
Ive been doing this since BTC hit 250.
So far so good.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:33:51
For this reason I never donated in BTC.
I offered to pay a friend 50 dollars, or 0.2 BTC at the time. He turned it down and told me to donate to wikipedia. 
We had been talking about bitcoin and he agreed to keep it for a few years before donating. After hitting 8k, we decided to sell in 2020, 5 years after the original decision. 
Looking forward to it!
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:35:58
Bcash is down 30% vs BTC since its inception.
The pool of owners is smaller too. 
I cant understand why anyone would use a Gen 1 coin that isnt BTC. Gen 1 coins suck(even BTC, but LN save us all). BTC is super rare though.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:27:04
How I buy crypto in 2018






How I know to avoid a crypto

Claiming its bitcoin is fraud.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:26:23
Seriously, do people not realize no one cares about their shitcoin or ICO?
Bitcoin and ETH are the only major cryptos. Everything else is at serious risk of going to 0.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:48:21
Bitcoiners are talking about technology, Alt-coiners talk about pump and price.
The end for many in crypto will be painful, they wouldnt listen.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:13:06
I dont know if anyone would accept litecoin though.
Bitcoin is one thing, but Litecoin was dead 4 months ago.

No no, 30% VS bitcoin.
Not vs usd. 
Its down 70% vs USD.

Can you explain, I dont think I've seen this word in a few years.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:34:09
The FUD is because people decided to buy Alt-coins instead of BTC. 
Now they realize transactions are about to become cheap and are freaking out because their alt-coin is no longer useful.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:28:38

As long as the government can impose taxes, they wont care. 
Inflation was a politically OK way to 'raise taxes', but it looks they might lose that ability.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:02:38

What benefit do you get from spreading FUD about bitcoin? Like your USD doesnt become more valuable.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:47:14
Do people not realize this is a problem for every crypto ever?
Ive never been able to go to a coffee shop and pay with any crypto. Once we get an NFC BTC LN reader, we will be in fantastic shape. 
If anyone wants to be the next Visa... I got an idea for you...
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:48:57
Rules I set for myself:
-Sell at ATHs or goals and dont feel bad about it.(and only sell what you need at the time, IE: wanted to buy an addition to the house)
-Buy AFTER the dip. When Bitcoin Hit 7,000$ I didnt buy more, it was on a bull run, maybe I should have but whatever, I waited until a few weeks after it stabilized around 10,000. I missed out on the 7k, but I didnt buy the irrationally high.
-Buy over weeks, not all at once. This means taking a market average rather than an instant in time. This is less risky but means less reward.
These are the safer ways to play markets, you can miss out on easy money, but you certainly wont be punished like OP.
Anyway, at the point, OP needs to HODL even if it goes  to 0.

Bitcoin fell 7% today.
BCH fell 11% today.
The market this week has nothing to do with tech. Why are you freaking out? If you have been here a while, you should be up 1000%. 
I will only worry if it drops below 1000.

Remember that 1 million dollars is quite common due to inflation.
Your parents might have multiple millions assuming they are saving for retirement.

I think you are overestimating LTC greatly.
Until the coinbase insider trading, LTC was dead and laughed at for years by the entire cryptocurrency community. (guessing you too bought LTC from coinbase in 2017 huh?)
Its a redundant currency. Bitcoin has massive flaws, and Litecoin isnt better. Using a gen 1 currency that isnt bitcoin is silly, no crypto nerd would develop for it knowing the flaws. 
We support Bitcoin because the world believes in it. Litecoin was dead 4 months ago.

I mean, a $6,000 hot tub was a luxury that I sold for.
EDIT: Should mention, I didnt want to touch my emergency or investment account, so thats why I sold.

Can anyone give me a counterarguement to this?
People are saying Litecoin is silver, but I think its yet another copycat coin and that Bitcoin is unique.
The world has agreed on Bitcoin, I dont think they agreed on any other crypto yet.
