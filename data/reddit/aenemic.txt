People relying on "morals" instead of common sense. Silk Road brought less violence and uncertainty to the drug business. Something that was obviously sorely needed. People who fret because of it are people who don´t understand that "illegal drugs" are just "immoral" drugs. Decided by some ass-hats a long time ago. Usually for racist or classist reasons.
Drugs are drugs, be that caffeine, alcohol or heroin. Choose the one that fits you(or none at all), don´t do it in excess and don´t bitch about others using something you don't approve of.
I though Bitcoin was about challenging the status quo and the authority of the state. And what better way to do that than to expose their idiotic war on drugs.

Another reason for not having a system based on making a profit and instead having one based on cooperation. Making sure everyone has what they need (house, clothes, food) instead of forcing wage labor for survival. Especially considering the amount of work that is dissappearing to technology.
In my country the unemployment among young people is hovering around the 50% mark. You know what Capitalists see? A possibility to lower wages and hiring the one willing to work the cheapest.
Sure, if every human being was perfectly rational and empathetic then capitalism might have worked, but alas such is not the world, and in a competitive system, those who are willing to cheat are often the most successful.
When you become "wealthy" and successful you want to protect that, and history shows us that that is usually done through violence, either through a sanctioned state(whom the wealthy often create themselves) or church(ditto), or simply as more mafia/yakuza like structures.

Anarchism does not simply mean without state, it means without rulers. (literal meaning of the word)
Think of it as a way of looking at and challenging hierarchies in society.
A boss at a company and a landowner are also rulers.
But that depends on what you put into private property rights. Do you mean property you live on and use daily? Or owning huge amounts of land and renting it out or hiring people to work it for you?
If your answer is the second one, then you obviously want a hierarchical structure to society, which is inherently anti anarchist.

I was in the pre-order, 900 bucks. Was dumb enough to pay with bitcoin at the time, when their advertisement said that you would make 25 bitcoins on said contract. They removed that after a week or so with no explanation, as well as lowered prices with no real "rewards" for those who paid double the price in pre-orders.
I tried my best to get a refund, but was met with stonewall silence after a couple of emails.
It was partly my own fault for not knowing better at the time, being a bitcoin noob riding the wave. But that was also their whole sales pitch, making bitcoin easier for beginners.
So yeah, I would say fraud.
(by now, after 7-8(?) months of mining I have been paid 1.75 BTC - and since mid march it has mined 0.05 btc - I might, depending on dollar value make ROI on $$, but as I said, I would have been much much much better of just spending that on coins, not to mention the fact that I was dumb enough to actually use bitcoin to buy the contract )

I have no idea how you equate the current state or fascism with communism/socialism, as both now and during fascist reigns privatization is and was high priority. Not to say they are very very different schools of political thought, fascism inherently totalitarian.
If you are thinking of certain policies that might have social benefits for certain groups, yes that happens, in that its more of a trickle up than a trickle down economics. "socialism" for the rich, ruthless capitalism for the poor.
I suggest you actually get to know what the political ideas Communism and Socialism are, beyond their historic State experiments. (Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc)
If you want to scream that what we have now isn't "REAL CAPITALISM" you can't just pretend that marxist-leninism or maoism is anything like what Socialism and Communism is.

This is in my ideal future. Where government, aka the goons of the wealthy is no more. Which is part of the point of bitcoin for me.
So this would be something that communities guaranteed, no centralized body.
Edit: I do however think that a country will have UBI and government before UBI and no government. But I also beleive that UBI and also Bitcoin to some extent will make people question the very idea of the use of money at all.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:26:31
Government has always been the common mans enemy, its just far more out in the open now. If bitcoin is to succeed several other "movements" has to succeed as well. Its not so simple as one coin to solve it all.
But if we continue to support efforts to decentralize, become more independent. Then over time hopefully the realization comes that we dont need government or giant multinationals. But people need to wake the fuck up and smell the bacon. If we want freedom, we have to take it ourself. And never give it away again to political parties or people who hoard power and wealth.

Remember on a global scale, most westerners are within the top 5% of global wealth.

Well, to achieve freedom we need to actually get rid of currency. As long as some are allowed more wealth than others, then their freedom is essentially greater than that of those with less currency. ie. Your freedom is decided by the amount of currency you can accumulate.
First step to me is decentralization. We have to realize that alot of the things we depend on can easily be produced locally.
We also have to realize that we cant really do anything ourself, we all depend on others for EVERYTHING we do. How could you even write this in the internet without THOUSANDS of hours of labour being put in? This goes for everything. The pencil a writer used, made by labour, the houses we live in, labour. And so on. Everything is social. Hence why should not the product of generations of innovation and labour go to the well being of EVERYONE on this planet and not just to the useless middlemen who accumulate capital?
I am asking this as a philisophical and idealogical question. Not to work within todays structures. I dont bother with today, we live in a system that creates violence and war.

And history of money is not very much better. We enslave a sizable chunk of the worlds population. Take away the government and keep the capitalism you will just find some other goon to protect the wealthies interests.

I dont know if you have realized, but money is fictional, be it bitcoin or USD. Its labour that makes the world spin, not money or its vultures. Without labour, and with that labourers, there would be nothing.
And it is about time that we wake up to this fact, its the poorest in the world who work the hardest to ensure that we live well.
We need to finally, now that it is beginning to be technologically possible, start automating as much as we can, and get rid of this ridicoulus notion that you have to "work for a living". News flash, there are not enough jobs, hence some will be destined to poverty.
I dont accept that status quo. And I do not believe we can solve it within what we call democracy today or within a capitalistic economic structure.

But really, ask at the aquapoics subreddit. Its not something you need experts to teach at all. Once you understand the basics of it, its quite easy to play around with different designs. A great DIY project that will keep the mind busy tinkering with different setups.

You do an amazing job reminding people that we are all humans and should behave like humans. You do what is right, and sadly that takes courage today because we have to step out of the comfort zone of everyday life. May your spirit forever burn intensely!

Yeah, but neat system. Easy to use for a vendor as well I would argue, just print a picture of your glyphs so people can pay. (bars, etc)

So moral of your story is this, we should just give up and follow orders?

YOu can have your 5000 square foot home, there wont be any slaves to cut your lawn and wash it for you though. Are you retarded? DO you really think normal families, without slave labour wants houses that big? Fine, let them live in one without a helping immigrant, see how fun it is. 
Your future governmentless free trade paradise will never happen. If you allow accumulation of wealth, the wealthy will find a new way of protecting their interest. Mafia, government, yakuza, whatever the hell you want to call it. The insane free market competition psyche is not good.

I´m guessing this is US only?

Well, it would need to go side by side with a new economic structure. Capitalism can not continue, with or without government in my opinion. The whole competetive free market brings out some of the worst traits in human psychology.

Judging from your excessive use of exclamation marks, trying to pull the age card seems foolish.
