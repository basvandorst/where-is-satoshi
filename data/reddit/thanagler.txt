Yessa massa. I's a didn't mean to infringe on the glory that is the one true crypto. The one to rule them all -like it flew straight out of a Tolkien book. The honor. The way and the life. The Bitcoin. Back to the stables with me. Never again shall I bother to utter forth my worthless opinion.

If you don't want to swim too far from the boat, might want to read up on litecoin. Many believe it's vastly undervalued and it's not quite as dangerous and picking a random altcoin if you're unfamiliar with the market. (Just a simple opinion).

Yes thank you for enlightening me, Captain Bitcoin. Too bad there aren't people or bots on here who are tasked with removing irrelevant information so righteous citizens like yourself don't have to go through the trouble.

I think this is someone's nod to 50 Cent's 'Get Rich or Die Trying' albums since they have "50+" ATM's.

As my wife sits and plays her bubble-candy-saga game on her phone (which she does at any opportunity.), she notices I've checked coinbase for the 3rd time (that she's seen.) And says, "you're getting addicted to checking that thing huh?" I'm like well it's either that or Facebook and Facebook doesn't make us money.

It happens man. Life can't be based on "what ifs" from the past. It happens in wallstreet daily. You did better than many.
