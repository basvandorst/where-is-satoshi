Well apparently the Robinhood app requires a temporary unfreeze of the credit file in order to process applications and verify accounts.

Yes, I know that. I never used the nickname to transact with my bank.

Is there a consensus on what the most reliable exchanges are at this point in time?

What do you mean wire the funds to gdax? Do you mean once the funds are received there is a simple process to do that on Coinbase and at that point I can just easily transfer them to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:05:23
And before doing that I would have to wait for the funds to have been deposited to GDAX from my bank account, which normally takes 4 business days, is that right? Whereas, with Coinbase, bitcoin can be purchased instantly with linked bank account?

So at this point if I already purchased on Coinbase, would the best thing for me to do at this point to transfer that money to a hardware wallet and moving forward any other purchases should be wired directly to gdax and placing a limit order, correct?

Where are people seeing the get early access screen? I signed up for the app but there was no "get early access page".

So if I bought $1,500 USD worth of bitcoins on Coinbase and then transferred my funds to GDAX would that have saved me anything in fees?

I don't understand your comment, why would they even have nickname as an option if it wasn't actually OK to use a nickname?

But with a limit order you could just be waiting around for your order to be filled if it does not reach the limit buy you put in. Meanwhile the market could possibly be steadily increasing leaving you sitting around and your order possibly not filled.

I can confirm that I did not put down my nickname as my real name because that would not make sense. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:10:47
Why do people suggest limit orders, when with market orders you know what you are getting with no uncertainty and the fees are so small?
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:52:08
I don't know. After the recent Coinbase debacle I have read numerous people suggesting it is a crazy idea to use your main bank account as your primary crypto bank account but instead to set up a separate bank account instead.

I just checked and apparently the early access option is only available on the website by entering your email? Robinhood support had no idea what I was talking about. I thought I would be able to sign up for early access by signing up for the app.

Didn't a lot of people lose money by using Tradehill once it shut down and they couldn't recover their coins? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:15:28
Basically was Mt Gox the main way to purchase and once that ended, people switched to using Coinbase mostly?
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:37:16
My question was more in regards to the safety of using your own personal back account in case something crazy happens like an exchange is hacked or something like that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:20:32
I have no idea.
