As licensed money transmitters, most states already impose minimum capital requirements on them.

Thanks for the correction.

I believe that their reserves are fully insured so that would not be the case.

I think you are right. The original version of the article indicated that the entire invite list would be accepted by the end of July but it was  changed to the new version (presumably due to the reporter misunderstanding the original statement).

Storing money in bitcoin doesn't help as much as buying things in bitcoin does. If you go to merchants you frequent and ask them if they can start accepting bitcoin, then use your Circle, Coinbase, etc. app to pay there it will help the ecosystem to grow.

I attended an ACAMS networking event in DC where I was able to talk with an FBI agent in the financial crimes division. He said that they have not seen any major use of Bitcoin by large scale criminal organizations or terrorists thus far and he didn't feel that they would ever adopt digital currencies due to the transparency in the system.

That was apparently a misquote since the original article was revised to say "significantly more" users by the end of July:

Just curious when these will be shipping. Ordered one almost two weeks ago.

Looking forward to the final product.

I think that was a misquote. The source article cited by the linked article says that they will have accepted "significantly more" by the end of July: 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:44:12
Agreed. If Bitcoin becomes synonymous with fraud more governments will move to regulate it to death.

Could be that this post was so long and rambling that people who don't agree with it gave up and moved on.

Basically the web equivalent of someone comparing your picture on your ID with your face when you try to buy something with a credit card or open a bank account.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:37:20
$10k is the threshold for filing a currency transaction report, not a SAR. There is nothing inherently suspicious about transaction over $10k, it becomes suspicious if people start trying to avoid the CTR record keeping requirements - that is when the bank will file a SAR.
You are definitely right that a bank can be shut down or heavily penalized for failing to file both CTRs and SARs.

Since KYC stands for Know Your Customer, it obviously has fraud connotations. If companies don't confirm that the person linking a bank account or credit card is actually the person who owns that account then they are just allowing fraudsters to steal money from innocent people. I personally like it when a teller at a store asks me for my ID for a credit card transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-25 00:47:55
Good point. Debit cards do not incur the fee.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:18:08
Exactly. No merchant can submit a charge to a bank account for a fraction of a penny.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:10:37
Good point, although they do if you are opening an account with a bank or money service business.
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:48:33
That is true. All information used to authenticate a customer must be maintained for 5 years.
See the "customer identification program" section at this link:

The $10 fee is charged by the bank that issued the card. Circle and Visa / MC don't get any portion of it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 03:06:30
Very good point. One would hope that they are doing that.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:42:59
Simple.com doesn't charge a fee when connected to Circle. I can't vouch for any others though.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:12:14
Is this "shorting" costing you more than the 1% transaction fee charged by Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:09:45
It is common practice in the banking world because they take deposits and make loans and are legally able to operate under that model based on their bank charters. 
Since all of those companies are operating as money services businesses and not banks, they are legally required to maintain full reserves and must prove as much to their regulators. If they ever were running a fractional reserve model you would hear about it when their regulators put them under an enforcement action.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:20:37
Exactly - There seem to be quite a few threads out there from people who don't understand that any transaction interacting with the traditional financial system takes time (strong selling point for Bitcoin).
It certainly would make sense that the Coinbase deposit process would have the same effect. I wonder how many more providers this guy will go through before he realizes that the common element is him.
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:08:53
I completely agree with you. It looks like Mt Gox wasn't even running fractional reserve, they were dipping into user funds for operating expenses... that is just theft. The whole fractional reserve concept is based on the idea that they have another use for their liabilities such as making loans. If all they do is offer exchange services and they have strong venture backing there is no reason why they would not be fully reserved.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:30:20
Companies like Circle and Coinbase that are heavily venture backed and have big names behind them are reliable enough to get insurance for their assets under management so you shouldn't have to worry. They all operate under full reserve models too so even they have to have 1 BTC for ever 1 BTC a user buys or deposits. They would need a banking charter to do anything else.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:53:10
Good idea
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:05:14
Those delays are caused by the bank ACH system so they will be the same regardless of where you go. It is the same as paying your credit card from your checking account, the funds leave your checking account on day one and show up on your credit card three or four days later. That is just the way it is until the ACH system is improved.

Saying that financial institutions "all have quotas" is stretching things a bit. Yes, an institution that has not filed any SARs within an examination period will have to answer some additional questions but it is not an uncommon situation for smaller institutions to go for some period of time without a filing. 
They will need to demonstrate that their AML program is effective and that they have proper procedures in place to detect and investigate suspicious activity - if they can demonstrate this then an examiner will generally give them a pass.
All in all, FinCEN has been fairly accommodating of digital currency innovation... after all, they could have taken the New York route. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 03:23:31
This exactly. People need to take a step back and ask how a 30% discount on prices that are already low is not too good to be true. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:32:05
It would technically be illegal to facilitate movement of funds from accounts that had not been properly verified to bank secrecy act standards of identity validation so that is probably how they fit it in under that notice. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:28:08
I think that must have been a different Circle as the Circle that acquired Poloniex has never offered a card product.

They are legal to buy in Cuba and bring back for personal use but they are not legal for resale in the US.

They are an MSB that has registered with FinCEN so they are safe from the purchasers perspective
You can search for companies here to see if they are registered:

That is a pretty standard means of connecting bank accounts if you don't want to wait for the whole micro-deposit process. Mint.com does something similar.

Fair warning that Local Bitcoins is technically illegal in the U.S.

I doubt it. The money may have left your account but they don't receive it for a couple of days. It is the same as depositing a check into your bank account.
They don't know whether the transaction will go through until that time is up so any company that gives you instant money is taking a risk that you will have insufficient funds or some other problem.

In this context they aren't, OFAC is there to enforce U.S. foreign policy.
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:47:48
It isn't even regulation in this case. Yes, regulators can shut a company down but they won't get a chance if a company loses all of its money to fraud.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:25:28
Very true.

Banks have the luxury of huge capital reserves. JP Morgan can afford to take a $4 billion London Whale loss without breaking a sweat. A venture backed startup needs to be a bit more careful.
