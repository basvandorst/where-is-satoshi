I've been thinking about something like this lately, but for all sites that do not use ads. Maybe some kind of Flattr-like  payment system where you evenly distribute your monthly payment to the websites you've visited.

What are those two buttons used for? Is it for entering your PIN code in binary?

EVEN if it was true that governments did invent money to control, it would still be a logical fallacy to say that money has to be controlled by the government.

Really small population (329,100! compare that to your town/city), so it's easy to do fast changes.
People are becoming aware of surveillance issues, so their pirate party is going towards the moon. This probably leads to discussions about related topics (such as Bitcoin).  Also, they had their Auroracoin which probably led to more consciousness about cryptocurrencies.
Just my guess.

I guess it's because it takes more space in the blockchain and is not really needed right now. It might happen in the distant future.
The extra decimal can make some of the cheapest things cheaper, sure. However, some products that costed .00000001 before would also cost more (maybe up to .000000019). But that doesn't mean that the overall price gets smaller. Why would it affect the price of more expensive things (ie the great majority of the products) with a factor 10?


You aren't creating more bitcoins, but more precision in the bitcoin. Think of gold. Before we only had sucky knifes, so we couldn't cut it down into too small pieces. Then we got better knifes and finally we got nanotechnology to cut the gold into as small pieces as physically possible. Did we create gold from thin air? No, we just made it more divisible and thus giving it more precision.

Has anyone contacted Timothy C. May and asked about his views on bitcoin?

Of course not, but if people want to start using it without opening a business, that's basically the things you can do. They can also start working at an enterprise that pays the employees in bitcoin, but it's not very easy to find such an enterprise. 
What parts of the bitcoin economy do you want me to read about?

What are you suggesting? That everyone starts mining?
