As a regular lurker who is interested in getting started any advice or resources i should be looking at? I honestly dont even know what bases i should use when judging light coins. Any help would be much appreciated.

Truth. I only regret not being into tech enough to understand how huge this would be.

That's essentially the problem with this pervasive money system. It is inherently inflationary. Furthermore you have institutions trying to collect interest on money that doesn't even exist.

*"The biggest problem with bitcoins, however, is conceptual: if they succeed, they fail.
If millions of people started using bitcoins on a regular basis, the soaring value of bitcoins would actually be disastrous. You’ve heard of hyperinflation: this would be hyperdeflation. Take a gold bar valued at $600,000. At $60 per bitcoin, the value of that bar is 10,000 BTC. But then assume that bitcoins rise in value to $600 apiece, and then to $6,000, and then to $60,000 — as would have to happen if the fixed number of bitcoins was being used to store hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Then the value of the gold bar would plunge, in bitcoin terms — to 1,000 BTC and then 100 BTC and finally just 10 BTC. The same thing would happen to all other goods and services in the world, including your own salary. Everything would be constantly going down in price, if you thought in bitcoin terms.
Inflation is bad, but deflation is worse. The reason is that in a deflationary environment, no one spends money — because whatever you want to buy is sure to become cheaper in a few days or weeks."*

I hope OP takes his money out before the bubble bursts.
