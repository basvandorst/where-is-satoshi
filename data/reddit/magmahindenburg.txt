Where are you browsing from? The server is hosted in Europe.

Bitcoin.com runs Wordpress on nginx. We are going to release a new version soon, so stay tuned. Bitcoin.com is hosted by Serious Tubes Networks (AS50066).

I would like to stretch that argument. What if IE was the only browser. Any other browser was not allowed to be installed on Windows. When users complain, the devs would just said "But you are using the web wrong. Why would anyone want to style their CSS that way?". All new web features needed consensus among the IE developers, and some of them regularly stated that "I don't see why we need HTML5. Building the web with tables is good enough for me". Any attempt to build a competing browser would be labelled "an attack on the Internet and the world wide web", and "I don't see how those Mozilla guys could do anything better than the experienced IE team".

The Core developers active in Reddit has played even more political games. From the miner perspective, the Core devs broke the agreement first. The miners have been very patient, but their patience is running out. There is a lot of arrogance from the Core devs (especially those on Reddit), and miners are simply fed up with their condescending tone.

You guys seriously don't know what censorship is right?

I have 50,000 testnet BTC, so if you need a few hundred, no problem :)

This is just completely unreasonable. Actually a majority of the users, transaction builders, exchanges are for Classic or Core with a 2Mb patch. What is going to happen is that when the consensus is triggered, Core will just merge the patch with the argument "There is clearly consensus for this to be merged". SW is implemented on both Core and Classic and hopefully this nonsense civil war can stop.

The most irresponsible thing here is to try to stop 2x. The hard fork is already locked in, over 90% of the miners and pretty much all big bitcoin companies, wallets and exchanges will follow the hard fork. The irresponsible choice in this case is to tell people that that should run Core 0.15, because after block 494784 the Core clients will not receive any more blocks. The blockchain will come to a full stop and users still running Core will need to wait hours, maybe days for the next block to come. Everyone using Coinbase, Copay, Bitcoin.com, Breadwallet, etc will not have any problems. They will continue to use Bitcoin without any problems after the hard fork.
You keep saying that it's irresponsible, but you are the one acting irresponsible here. By not informing people properly about the hard fork and instead tell people to fight and install Core 0.15, you are making it worse. You keep saying that it's rushed and that the community needs a long time to adjust to a 2x hard fork. But you know what, if something takes a long time you better start asap. The only thing you have done is to make people less prepared for the hard fork.

It's your right not to follow that chain, but you are basically campaigning for others to create blocks for you on your old chain. As things look right now, the likelihood of miners long term creating blocks on the legacy 1x chain is small.
If you don't follow the 2x chain, you are most likely going to receive a few blocks per day if any are created at all. Any money you might receive have a small chance of getting confirmed in those few blocks that will be mined for the first few days before the chain is abandoned. But your money will be confirmed and safe on the 2x chain.
With over 90% of the hashrate and almost all major bitcoin exchanges and wallets agreeing on SegWit2x, that's as close we can get to widespread support across the entire community. Getting a large group of people to decide on anything with 100% support is pretty much impossible, and opens up for a small minority group to dictate everything. A system where a small number of loud intolerant people gets the final say will not work long term.

Why do you assume that ViaBTC, or any other miner, intended to upgrade their bitcoind to the latest version anyway? Maybe they all just plan to keep running Bitcoin Core 12.1?
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:18:39
It's not only the miners. The rest of the Bitcoin community and companies are fed up with Core as well.
