It’s important that it keeps significant value relative to other coins because otherwise the entire concept is somewhat undermined.

People are buying into a concept. That a virtual currency not supported by a government is worth something. That it will continue to be worth something. Bitcoin is the gold standard in that it's been around the longest and has continually been judged as worth something. If in 5 years time another coin or token exceeds it in value I think that would probably be okay not to shake confidence but if it starts sliding too much in relation to later coins I suspect a lot of people will being to wonder if the whole concept isn't built on sand. I don't think you're wrong but the whole concept required a leap of faith. A belief that it's not all a bunch of nonsense.

Is this a thing in the US to put hobbies and interests on cakes? We only do it for children in my country

Your whole political system is pretty much broken. The U.S had a good run but realistically it's getting a bit old for such a big country. It's well in to decline and should probably break up into several smaller states.

The journalist asked a legitimate question. He almost certainly knows the answer but he has to act as an audience surrogate.

Ha ha ha.. The Democrats are centrists, maybe even a little to the right of centre.

Can I suggest that you donate to the Dahlia project. It supports survivors of Female Genital Mutilation in the UK. I'm not in the UK so I'm not sure if there are similar charities elsewhere. Sometimes issues that are unpleasant to talk about find it hard to raise money. If you are more focused on science and technology there are also charities that teach young girls to code and encourage young women in science. Anyway just a suggestion. You're doing a great thing.

He's not making an argument he's putting some context to his question.

Week the amount of time is indicative of acceptance as a store of value. Of course it's largely illogical that gold is valued as it is, it's cultural and historical. Perhaps Bitcoin will end up like gold or silver, perhaps it won't.

Gold can be used for electronics and also for jewellery. It also has 1000s of years behind it as an accepted store of value. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:38:00
You may be correct. At 1000 a lot of miners might switch off and supply will decrease. Although if you are already invested and electricity is cheap you might as well keep Mining. It would be interesting to know how low it would need to be for large scale miners to just give up.

What reason do you have for it to stop going down? Are you buying any? Of course not. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:39:56
How has all the one sided extremely positive “ it’s not a bubble you idiot.... hodl “ talk been going? A bit of balance in opinions means less people making dumb decisions.

He means see if it goes up.... it is going up
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:49:39
I’m fine thanks.

Whoever invented that nonsense was the greatest manipulator of the market. Seriously. But a speculative asset with high volatility and never sell it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:07
It will need to stay at 1k for a long time before any significant buyers come in. Maybe some people fleeing the alt coins might prop it up a little. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:56:28
Sure but once you’ve bought one you might as well run it if it’s covering electricity costs?  But there must be a point where the noise and the hassle gets  too much. Even if the difficulty does go down massively. Or maybe I’m completely wrong and the mining will continue.
