Those cost &lt; $1 by the company that made them. They sell it to retailers for around 2x production cost, who sell it to consumers for roughly 2x their cost. You're comparing currency to a business models. You're a fucking idiot.

Yes. Thats why we accept it in exchange for goods amd services

Nearly 100% of humans. Dont act like you don't use fiat. You sound like an idiot

Fees and/or potential rise in price

I see you conveniently placed "bubble pop" over the dates because you know it would render this meme useless 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:56
At first i read this like some ultra rich dude wanted 5% of ALL bitcoin lol

"Hey guys I'm in! just bought my first 0.0000001 bitcoin refreshing coinbase religiously haha maybe if the price rises 10x that'll cover my transaction fees"

They should make gold amd silver rounds like that! They'd be really cool and have some tangible value. And it would also be a little ironic as well
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:32:56
I have at least a few silver bars with their name on them!

Pretty much everything you said is true. But your argument is basically "just because everything has been going well, it doesnt mean it will continue to go well. It means it will turn around and crash" a goid track record doesnt mean there will be a goid future. But a good track record certainly doesnt mean the future will be bad! The conclusion is, nobody knows. My original response was to a comment with ZERO information saying, the market will crash soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:05
I know right its only going higher

 This is a terrible post and it makes bitcoin look worse

Regulations were introduced. For example, a mortgage broker is not allowed to contact an appraiser to prevent generous appraisals, giving loans worth more than the asset.

NFLX is up 1500% in the past 5 years and the DOW literally hit an all time high today. With all due respect- where the fuck are you getting your information?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:57
so its her fault you're in the red then ?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:07:26
Oh I totally understand. Congrats on your success thus far, though!
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:56:39
Holy shit! This is what I like to see. One of the most recognizable names in the precious metal industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:00:48
No. No its not.

FB is worth half a trillion. Not a fucking chance.

Facebook inc owns way more than facebook, check it out

The title is so fraudulent it hurts. I hope you realize you're hurting bitcoin by making us look like idiots

Sell 2.5btc and get roughly $50k. Hodl the rest
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:32:59
Could have held 50% as a core "buy and hold" position, while trading the other 50% that way if it trades sideways, you make money trading. If it skyrockets like it did, you still make a boatload on your core position. You wouldn't make as much but its still a win/win. Thats what i do with stocks and I'm looking to start applying the strategy to crypto
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:18:21
Losing Holers just as fast. Bitcoin has dropped down to my  largest hodling. Fees are insulting and the longer it takes to get fixed, the  more bearish I become.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:02:32
Why on earth would you carry 1.5b of anything around? There's no utility to needing that much value on hand, you'd have to be a moron to walk around with 1.5b. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:59:58
Thank God most top comments chose gold. Faith In this sub is restored, If everyone said BTC I was going to unsub. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:39:45
Im not sure of a price target right now. But my point was people love having an opinion when they have no money involved...we can agree on that surely 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:43:56
Like he said, 10k was a psychological number. Whole numbers tend to get sold off. Same with stocks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:44:26
What a dick. Im not saying that because I think BTC will rise. People always tell you to sell when they know nothing and act like they're doing you a favor. My dad tried convincing me to sell my FB shares at $17 when he knows nothing about stocks or Facebook.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:26:21
This is madness. Nothing should rise this fast without a correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:00:27
This is what I want to see on here- well written,  intelligent ideas. Memes can be fun, but it gets old and annoying when I thought this sub was going to be a place to come for information and conversation. Keep it up please! We need newcomers to see conversations like this so it doesn't turn them away
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:48:23
Great investment! Not being sarcastic, that was the best investment you could have made
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:50:37
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:22:06
No. But you're still wrong. Theres people smarter than you with more power that will not let the dollar collapse 
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:20:10
What a terrible post. Annoying title and shitty content
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:53:28
The USD isn't going to collapse. You don't know that. You're whole premise is flawed
