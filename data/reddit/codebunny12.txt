These are just my thoughts. If you don't agree then fine, this is my first post about bitmain lol relax
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:50:40
Yeah it's ridiculous :p they are pumping stocks so hard.. You can't even mention bitcoin

I guess I was referring to the electronic/digital cryptographic, cryptocurrency domain when I say 'withstood the test of time'. For something to resist hacking, reverse engineering on an open public platform, with massive monetary reward I might add, for 7 years isn't insignificant in my mind. In game hacking it can take a matter of hours to reverse engineer the executable of a game and release a hack with a single person

All I said was look into bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:48:48
This guy is an absolute fraud lol how can you take him seriously
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:45:13
Why can't bitcoin be both a store of value and a currency?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:15:48
Damn man, I remember how hard it was for me to loose my grandpa. All the best to your family

Well this would depend on the specific device. But in general water damage wouldn't necessarily imply data loss, it would kill the device probably but your keys could probably be recovered. If your device landed up in a fire, then yes you could loose your keys, so ideally you could write your private and public keys down on a piece of paper (to prevent hacking), keep that locked up and secure and then use your hardware wallet.
So even if your hardware wallet was destroyed, you could still access your bitcoin, buy another hardware wallet and repeat...

Hi guys i'm starting a new bitcoin called bitcoin copper. 100% pre-mine, 100GB blocks and EDA. Visit  Bitcoin copper is the new Bitcoin!  /s
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:39:55
Congrats on your new HODL device
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:39:23
wow ;) I'm sure this will help newbies though, so thanks

Governments cannot regulate bitcoin itself, but rather the interfaces between buyers and sellers such as exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:11:34
Every node counts, thanks a ton man, we all really appreciate it!

You can think of coinbase as a 'bitcoin bank' and a hard wallet as similar to keeping cash in your pocket. If something had to happen to your 'bitcoin bank' you may loose your bitcoin as they technically own the property rights of those said bitcoin. 
There is also the possibility that your 'bitcoin bank' might get hacked as was the case with the infamous MtGox fiasco.
A hardware wallet protects you against all of these uncertainties and theoretically, the only way you could loose your bitcoin was if your hardware wallet was stolen and your passphrase known to the attacker
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:22:47
If you want to cash in on bitcoin 'dividends' in the future, I highly recommend controlling your private keys yourself which implies using a software or hardware wallet and not an online 'bitcoin bank'
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:35:13
The title is a direct quote out of the bitmex paper. Not misleading in the slightest as the whole article was about the implications of EDA and I am focusing on one aspect of their research
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:31:26
A paper wallet is theoretically the most secure option, it's just that if it gets lost or something else happens to it you might loose access to your bitcoin. A hardware wallet makes transfers easier and is a very secure option. Go paper only if you want to lock it away in a vault somewhere and forget about your bitcoins for years :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:42:17
lol you are absolutely crazy to do that and it's just irresponsible 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:19:45
Thank you and yeah enjoy the holiday! :)

This is his second post on here, someone is definitely not happy with this post
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:55:28
True, but still, those mods are really edgy 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:34:44
Those satoshi's will add up over time :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:38:51
Millions of innocent people around the world are having their wealth stolen from them or seized by governments and criminals.
There is absolutely no argument against bitcoin facilitating the store of value role, it is one of the most sort after properties of bitcoin by those facing persecution. Buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin comes after and the technology to drive this adoption into cheaper and faster transactions is coming. 
We need to think not of those with money seeking a bitcoin that allows for convenient transaction, but those with no bitcoin, facing persecution that want to safeguard their money first. This project was started to benefit mankind 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:15:17
lol why are you so angry at this post?
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:23:37
"please stop with this nonsense." you have like 5 replies on your post history with the exact same wording
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:56:23
:) Just be responsible with your money and remember that you should never invest more than you are willing to loose.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:05:54
Of course it's not working, just staying vigilant 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:31:14
You received bcash by default if you owned bitcoin prior to the fork occuring ;) You can claim it through various means such as a software wallet that both supports bcash and bitcoin.
Oh and welcome :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:50:26
I personally own a bit of ethereum and litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:28:00
lol everyone spamming blockfolio, I guess it's a decent option.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:25:00
So you don't think bitmain deserves some competition ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:05:12
Looks a bit negative. "It's all gone" lol
But it's good publicity for bitcoin nonetheless 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:23:05
No it is actually possible to broadcast the network via satellite, it's pretty cool isn't it? :D Now most people can't be denied the right to bitcoin ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:24:48
I think it would be misconstrued to think that Bitcoin can never solve its scalability issues. One often finds throughout history, that most technical challenges can be defeated given enough time and patience.
Bitcoin is taking a responsible approach, the big blockers wanted a fast and easy fix, fine. But what they didn't think of was the implications of their 'fix'. Every technical solution has implications.
Numerous high ranking, and I mean highly respected, academics have argued that simply increasing the block size is not sustainable and introduces a new kind of centralization to the network who's implied consequences cannot be fully understood.   
You see increasing the block size relies on the premise that Moore's law or some other law governing cell (memory, storage) capacity holds to accommodate ever growing block size increases. With over 1 billion users, blocks would be unimaginably large and certainly no where near the realm of reality we live in, with the storage and memory constraints we currently have, and those future capacities that exist as projected from our current state. Moore's law has for a long time now, shown signs of a break in the upward trend.
I think you also underestimate the demand for a storage of value. It is easy for someone in the first world to neglect this property since these first world states, usually do not have unstable regimes that actively persecute, kill and steal wealth from people on huge wide national scale. 
However the people from the third world think you are wrong. So wrong that the people in Zimbabwe are willing to pay double the price of bitcoin to secure their wealth. Do you think they care about buying a cup of coffee for $0.003? 
In regards to the scaling issue just mentioned, lightning and segwit represents the most efficient solution, enabling incredibly cheap and instant transactions and most importantly, is it able to extend the bitcoin ecosystem to a mass scale without storage and memory contraints

Most volume coming from bithumb is being proxied through Korea by Chinese miners since China banned exchanges. There are a lot of Bitmain linked and other shady trails behind this pump that people cannot ignore as they have the most to gain

Hey man. Congrats for getting into crypto and bitcoin, welcome to the bitcoin community first of all :)
Coinbase is a good starting place for newbies, but bare in mind that you are trusting them with your bitcoin and so if something had to happen to them as an entity or business, i.e get hacked, sued, go bankrupt, you might end up loosing your bitcoin or other alt coins. 
If you are investing an amount you would considered substantial relative to your savings I suggest I hardware wallet.
In regards to the best time to buy, well that's up to you, the market is certainly unpredictable, thus it is hard to say. There is some exciting things going on in the bitcoin world, they often say that the best time to buy was yesterday

Hi welcome to the bitcoin community :)
OK now to address your question(s).
There are various ways to accept bitcoin as a payment. In general you might want to use a payment gateway/processor with bitcoin support. There are many of these: BitcoinPay, BitPay and even coinbase offers a payment processor. Usually they will take a small free from each transaction for providing you their service.
Your private key can be dumped using the command line interface of the bitcoin-core software wallet. However for $50 worth of bitcoin I would recommend getting a software wallet such as Electrum which allows you to send and receive bitcoin without waiting to download the entire blockchain and will allow you to export your private keys easily or to just stick with coinbase, but for larger amounts definitely take it out
I think your best bet is going through a payment processor such as the ones listed above if you do not know how to set up one yourself, which I would recommend if you were a programmer.

What do you do? Celebrate! 
Jokes aside I recommend you transfer your Bitcoin into a hardware wallet. Don't keep anything on exchanges and be extremely careful with your bitcoin, people will go to great lengths to steal them from you or hack you
