So you keep all your assets in cash, right? Nothing in the bank, because that's not real money either time_dj?

Unfortunately I'm not sure a Jersey-domiciled fund will work for US IRAs/401Ks.... plus the minimum investment is &gt;$100,000

I believe there's about £1 trillion of assets held in Jersey trusts, banks and under administration. Lyxor, a very large French fund manager, bases all its funds on the island for example. 
A lot of English-speaking jurisdictions prefer it to Luzembourg or Switzerland as the law is much more similar to English Law and the regulatory environment is pretty much a carbon copy of the UK's regime.

Enquire via the investment manager's website 
And yes, they really do hold bitcoin

Unfortunately for bitcoin, there is a huge amount of double-counting in this article. Think about it: if bitcoin were to replace global M2 that means it 'is' the world currency. At which point, why would central banks be holding foreign exchange reserves? There wouldn't be any foreign exchange! So to me this piece shows that the _maximum_ price one might imagine bitcoin reaching is $2.8mn. It seems much more likely to me that it takes on some of the functions of gold investment meaning $100k-$300k. Another thing to consider would be a country with a weak, unstable currency completely abandoning its fiat and using bitcoin instead. There is precedent for this: in central America, Panama, Ecuador and El Salvador all Dollarised around year 2000 thus giving up any monetary policy to the United States. For a country like Zimbabwe, Bitcoinisation would be pretty attractive.

There are indeed some people who think that somehow a physical gold ETF is suppressing the price of gold, but frankly they are the paranoid fringe and the evidence is to the contrary: since commodity ETFs grew massively in size (starting in about 2002), the price of gold has rallied by nearly 8x.
Germany's issue with gold is a little different and they're probably being a bit too meek about it. And anyway, that is REAL gold in physical storage -- the equivalent of BTC on the blockchain -- stored by another government. Isn't part of the point of buying into the cryptocurrency ecosystem that we don't TRUST the government with our money?
This particularly fund is regulated and that's kind of the whole point - it has to demonstrate, through the use of a third party custodian and administrator, that the assets are REAL and are not loaned out or re-hypothecated. So every dollar this fund attracts will be a real dollar invested in some part of the bitcoin ecosystem. 
There are a growing number of derivatives being offered on bitcoin - swaps, options, loans and the like -- and indeed these may or may not be underpinned by real, physical crypto on the blockchain, so potentially you are right, but a fund that invests in 'hard' bitcoin and other parts of the ecosystem isn't a derivative any more than Berkshire Hathaway stock is.

That's a bit harsh. There are 100,000 people on Jersey (give or take). Barely any of them are 'wealthy European tax exiles'. There are doctors, dentists, fisherman, farmers as well as bankers &amp; (now) some tech people. And one 4G mast would do a bad job as there are lots of little valleys that would be hard to reach into....

I'm not sure I understand your point Vibr8gKiwi. If a fund buys BTC and you own shares in that fund, how is that materially different from, say an investor buying shares in a Gold ETF because it's easier than buying physical gold in a vault for an individual? Or a money-market fund as an alternative to depositing all your cash with one bank? 
And in what way are 'these funds' trading off-blockchain and how would that "keep prices down"? For the manager of the fund, who probably earns a performance fee, that would kind of defeat the object surely?
As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, the ecosystem will inevitably expand to include more payment mechanisms, more merchants accepting bitcoin but also more ways to invest in bitcoin-related businesses -- just like there are a gazillion banks, credit card companies etc out there to buy shares in right now. No?

Jersey has been trying to recruit more 'high value residents' to the island. There's a lot on the website  
It's a relatively straightforward process if you are moving a business to the island that can have the potential to hire some local staff, or are bringing tax revenue to the island some other way. 
If you are seriously interested contact them through the website and I'm sure they'd be glad to go through it with you.

Well, Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited, the REAL company are not scammers. These phishing guys are scammers who have hijacked our good name for their nefarious purposes.
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:35:36
Yes it's a scam. We're dealing with it but they're hard to shut down, keep shifting to different bulk emailers, using different site hosts. Thanks for the alert though and we hope nobody is naive enough to fall for 150% return
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:34:26
It's a scam. We're dealing with it. Thanks for the heads up.
