A ponzi scheme, a ponzi normally promises you a return and does not actually give you anything for money invested... Bitcoin DOES not promise you a return, value goes up and DOWN! And for your money you get your coins, and you can only use loose money when you sell!

I have an account with cryptopay.me, been around years, I buy on there as well. I had one of their debit cards, but I recently had to transfer £100 out via bank transfer, took 3 days but all went well. Attached is a referral link, but if you are unhappy about referral links just google cryptopay .. Happy days!
  
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:53:17
Yeah at 21 quadrillion sats
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:34:14
Just send a fraction of Btc to it! Keep your stash on trezor

Banks, visa, MC will have to jump on or be left behind! Swiss banks, Japanese banks welcome crypto$
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:02:21
With cryptopay you deposit Btc in your 'custodial wallet' and price goes up and down, when needed you send some Btc to the card address and it flips it to fiat, which you spend, if you don't spend it, then unload the card. Back into Btc, worked well for me, and as it takes seconds, was a handy tool to jump out on the highs and back in on the lows ..:-)
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:45:48
Not all banks, just most of them, banks in Switzerland are open to Bitcoin and because of that, they will do well!
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:39:32

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:28:42
So if your Bitcoin was purchased and stored let's say coinbase, where you do not hold your private keys, they do, you would not have to declare! Is that correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:56:01
No your thinking of fiat
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:07:49
I use cryptopay
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:37:19
I wish people would read up about the tech before opening their mouth's
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:53:14
I was that person 3 years ago
You will be ridiculed at first, but now people are asking me how to get involved! Its crazy here in cryptoland!
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:04:14
Most people use coinbase to start, it's easy and you can buy with a debit card!
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:26:29
I was lucky, I started buying at £150 per coin :-) and I am still buying at £8000 per coin.

Bitcoin debit card, store as Btc and spend fiat!! 
These are the guys I use , its a referral link I have been with them 3 years..
 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:59:06
Shops want to take it, so people will spend it, I hold Bitcoin and have a Bitcoin debit card and spend about £20 worth a week, low fees even for little loads :-) and because value is going up for Bitcoin it is like a money fountain :-) long live Bitcoin 
I only use a small amount of play Bitcoin main stash on a trezor 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:16:45
I have no real stance on if it will go up or down, but overall it will continue to go up! Which as a holder is a gods thing, I hope
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:49:31
Bitbargain.co.uk , takes about 20 mins per trade though... But works, takes bank transfer (swift) so fast, pingit, NatWest pyc and other, no debit card and fees were I remember we're a little higher then CBase
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:23:08
PS they allow loading up to 16k per day for verified accounts
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:09:03
:-(  cryptopay :-( hence I only keep a small fraction of Btc on there,... Rest in my trezor
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:44
Was on the radio and the news here in the UK for 5 days on the trot, wait till 20k... :-)

Lol, how? As if there judicial service isn't over worked already....!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:35:52
When they do, I think anyone who owns Btc will eat up the sells, making Btc more expensive for the next batch of futures, hodlers are winner winner chicken dinner, with a bump along the way!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:00:51
It has been for me!  :-) and I hope never to sell just skim the profits... :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:33:54
Sorry, there is no mention of it, but I would like to think that as its prepaid and not debit or credit card there would be no limit!  Buy for large purchases I would use bitpay! Or similar , as these guys pay fiat to the vendor and I pay in Btc, charges apply
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:18:58
Welcome guys, I have been in it 3 years and I wish I bought more! But saying that I am sooooo happy with my holdings. I buy on coinbase then when I have a nice pot I transfer to my jaxx wallet :-)
To the moon!

Will added schnorr signatures make it double cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:03:26
Yes, hence I keep majority as Btc in there account as load takes 30 secs, I only really load £50 per time, 1% regardless of amount, you can unload as well as quick, so maybe you could catch a dip??
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:49
I think you're still early :-)
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:57:14
Schnorr SIG's... Yay 
I used a faucet a long time ago.. Got next to nothing, but in today's value a nice sum, but feck when I moved it to my trezor fees were poo! This will help me maximize my coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:01:18

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:02:35

@_date: 2017-12-02 14:30:57
I don't like the futures market, I have heard they will be settled in fiat... ?!?! Unsure why, but I also think it will be a good as it will raise the Bitcoin value, highs and lows!
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:09:58
Yes, their app is seamless !
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:42:43
I have never sent fiat to my account with cryptopay, I have always used an exchange to buy my Btc with my normal debit card as I like to take control of my coins and I transfer to my trezor, my cryptopay account is like a little slush fund to play with, and treat myself before the big days ahead in early retirement (I am 51) so I hope for a few good years, when the coins on my trezor are even more valuable! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:40
This is the dip! But it does look like a peak it maybe 'the dip' before £20k
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:24:07
if I was there I would carry on with Bitcoin. The petro will be government owned I guess  and I am not a fan of Maduro
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:40:06
That is a lot of coins, but they are limited, ?? I am on the fence with ripple but think any investment in xrp you should mirror with xlm.... One of those two will do very well!
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:18:32
It's not that I am thinking of Btc as a currency but it is evolving as a currency with lighting network, rootstock, atomic swaps and more . I make sure I don't spend more then any profits made.. Yes I would like to keep all my coins but with a teenage daughter I just need a little extra now and again, when I can afford more Btc I buy bits :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:57:28
Xrp is limited!! Yes ripple have 55 billion in escrow but overall is limited to about 99 billion..
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:19:44
Unless merchants adopt payment via Bitcoin, and that is happening, even a place in Switzerland accepts Btc for payment of taxes... More will follow, MasterCard / visa / amazon / paypay etc etc if they accept we will spend!

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:32:15
Bitcoin is a store of wealth, it is supply and demand that gives it value NOT new people investing, yes it will Plataea, but with something like 0.3% of the population using it / toped with 39billion people denied access to a bank account, the actual effect of Bitcoin is that it is actually giving money to those who take part. Banks are run on debt, Bitcoin isn't .Banks push you into debt with no regard to if you can really pay it back.
Bitcoin has a supply / demand network, online shops, speculative investors, futures trading and a LIMITED SUPPLY so like gold, the more people and business ( a few big names in and more coming) its value will go up and more business will accept ... 
Its all good here in cryptoland :-)  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:03
I skim profits! I will leave a referral link if you think it will help.
A few years ago I bought Bitcoin at £150, as you know value now, I wanted to skim a little profit but keep my stash as large as I can. 
I ordered the below Bitcoin debit card, I loaded £1600 worth of Bitcoin into my online / app account and waited a couple of weeks the value went up and I transfered £50 to the debit card and used that card to buy my shopping, leaving more of my wages in the bank to pay off my debit,

I noticed cryptopay.me now allow debit card buys, I think fee free at the moment, have to use euros but my UK bank account work with it, I only mention it as in my opinion coinbase is safe enough but it will be getting very busy, here is a referral link if it helps  
Just saying!
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:08:19
Why not? Cem futures trading in the US and I hear Russia as well (TBC) / ETFd opening up to hedge funds, gold markets have stated that they will take 5% of holdings and invest in crypto$ , only to use profits to buy more gold, the word profits stuck in my mind from that article, even the gold market are bullish on crypto$... Strap in sir anything is possible in cryptoland! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:07:03
Well done, I have been with Bitcoin 3 years and life is looking much better now! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:09
0.23% is a lot of money in a $100 billion market cap, and I think the above mentioned companies will cut costs like that quickly, even if they don't adopt and use bitpay that is one big customer for Bitcoin, just another exchange to me!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:57:32
Been around about 4 years, recently had an ICO I have been using their bitcoin debit card for 6 months, just skimming profits, small amounts, and their load fee for their card is 1% , reasonable I think!

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:07
I agree, I am not keen myself to see a futures market in Btc, but the positive side is the free advertising ! , I was lucky to catch a drop about 3 years ago, went from £1000 to £150.... Caught my eye was on the news, I research it and bought in (wish I had bought more) any news can be good news as look at it now, its just another hurdle to jump!

But as of today they were free, I know it he had held onto even that bit of Bitcoin it may be worth lots of money (pizza gate) and all that, but they were free! Spend little bits to treat myself, I use a Bitcoin debit card!

I kind of agree, banks spreading fud, fueling a price drop so they can buy in cheap, but I believe that with new money coming in, we are holding and only drawing off small amounts of profits (which is now a considerable large amount of fiat) leaving the majority as crypto$  so either we are all in buying frenzy or people see the future is in blockchain

Dips in my view are getting less and less volatile, I have only been around 3 years but I remember dips lasting 2 weeks, now if it dips for two minutes your lucky :) 
I would dive in, the price will only go up over time!

Everyone I told about it years ago and just getting into the tech are now money experts :-)
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:45:34
Maybe! But as Bitcoin matures to a store of wealth as it was designed for, these spikes and dip will be less and less! Bitcoin tech is revolutionary! Pandoras box has been opened, no going back now! 
But I do wonder how governments and banks will try and stop it,!
1. turn the internet off? 
2. Ban all fiat / crypto$ exchanges!
I think 1. Will never happen and 2. I would rather pay Btc/Btc anyway :-)
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:38:13
Xrp saves up to 60% on transactions fees, foolish not to use it! Visa / MasterCard could develop their own coins but they won't (I think) they will just use ripplenet and in time use xrp to save costs or xlm equivalent ! IMO
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:52:03
Why ridiculous? Are you talking about revenue or profit, visa revenue is around $18.3 billion and profit $6.7 billion. Xrp delivers 4 second transaction times and tiny fees! Visa and MasterCard must use the system or fail! And xrp has a market cap of $88 billion 4 times bigger then visas revenue.. Yet still people post before knowing the facts! 
Yes it may fail but on the past few years it shows potential to grow!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:17
Even if they do, people who understand Bitcoin will truly just keep buying the dips... A few tears along the way, theirs not bitcoiners !
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:34:27
Maybe the other way around,
100,000,000 SATs per Bitcoin, 21 million Bitcoin = 21 quadrillion SATs , that's more coins than xrp and their smaller parts called drops...which tops out at 1 quadrillion !
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:45:45
People will just eat up any sell they push, the honey badgers have been released..! IMO
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:01:37
No, the difficulty rate will change, estimates at the moment are the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140, supply and demand will soon increase its value to its true potential, never mind its tech!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:44:32
And they are doing very well from it, lots of investment etc looks like a nice place, called zug or zup I think!
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:39:08
39% but was last year, so may have changed a bit, but I make that 2.9 billion people 
And 0.3% of people using this tech and value is now at £8700... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:17:04
Won't happen! It's here and I implore you to read up on it, when you understand it then comment for good or bad, be truthful did you know 39 billion people worldwide are denied a bank account! With a cheap mobile phone they can have access to a worldwide market! 1% of the population own 99% of the worlds wealth this number is about to change and will be cataclysmic on the worlds markets and finical system. And for an £86 buy in for 1 million satoshis is maybe worth a gamble. Its going to be massive IMO, and I have read lots of bad things that have not yet come true, this is about the 7-8th time I have been told its a bubble, and I still can not see it stopping down at £8600 for very long £50k next year!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:27:28
Not on mine! Once it is transfered and exchanged for fiat there is no more charges for spending your fiat, other then the £1 per month as stated before! Taken directly from my card, good value if you ask me, I can send you a federal link if interested!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:12

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:01:55
I use cryptopay to buy Btc, but they only sell Btc, their debit cards are fab... Here is a referral link, I think you get a discount on their debit card, I have used their service for 3 years and their debit card for 8 months now, I like it!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:57
No charge per swipe, only the above mentioned £1 per month and no limits to how many times you use it, £5 - £16k max daily load limit
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:17:41
Then governments will fall! People will use Bitcoin and governments will fall, I watch Venezuela as its is an ongoing fight between corrupt government and the people! Who will win ???

Moving Btc to a crypto card and using live a gold visa card spending on services and goods, tax would be paid buy the vendor, and as on my card can be loaded at £16k a day you should have no trouble spending it! 
I store only £400 Worth of Btc in my cryptopay.me account, as the value goes up let's say £440 I transfer a little piece of the Bitcoin £40 onto my crypto debit card. Spend that and still go £400 worth of Bitcoin I know that I am reducing my Btc but this is just a small amount that helps me with shopping. My main stash is held and will till it is worth enough for me to retire. I guess it would work on a larger scale!

Reading HRMC paper seems like tax (vat) is paid by the seller of the said coffee etc only pay capital gains tax when chasing it in for fiat.. Which I do not intend to do!
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:59:11
I use coinbase to buy, don't like to store them on there! At least he will be buying:-)
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:54:13
I transfer Btc to a European Btc provider and then load their Btc credit card its converted to fiat, at their present rate, I use it as a normal debit card, I do not draw cash on it, as that is extra cost! But I could if needed.
Its a long way round but until micro transactions AND aldi starts to accept Btc it will have to do!

Another way to look at is, fiat money is crashing down. The mighty euro, pound and dollar are all loosing value!

Oh yeah! As norm you have to verify your id and then you can order one! Max I hold in their online wallet is £300 and I use for grocery shopping... For the last two months have had £300 in there ... Still got £300 in there and been shopping loads :-)

At least you have some...! I tell everyone to buy in, as little as £10 a week and have been for 2 years, I think people thought I was crazy, I posted all over facebook I was like a man on a mission, 2 years on people are asking me now "how do I get in?" 
Just buy a few mBtc whenever you can! Remember as the price goes up the more you will be able to buy with your 100 mBTC or as one reddit member calls moonbucks!

Wow never invested that much, my buy ins have been around £200 - £400 over a few years, back when they were worth £150 each... Now I buy some to spend on the 'darkweb' how I hate that term, and put the change I have I just squirrel away. 
You could buy £500 a week to spread any potential losses over a short 10 week period, but on the long hold you will make money, if you want to short your coins and make some money over a short period then 'fees are fees' !

I watched that on rt... Thought it was great!
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:00:17
There will be a cryptosystem even if Btc crashes, the bank owned ripple network would carry on with xrp in a centralized ledger.
I love Btc and think its the king of coins but don't delude yourself and think that its the only coin, many other coins work EOT is one I may get interested in
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:04:27
Just get a crytpo debit card and transfer a few micro bits onto it and spend where ever visa is accepted... So you can spend little bit of profit and keep your bulk Btc increasing in value..
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:02:11

Take the amount you can afford to invest and divide it by 4 and get that much each week. So if you have £200 to invest start by getting £50 a week, then after a month see how you feel. I got in at £150 per coin.... Whish I bought more! But I am still buying and still gaining .... Yay
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:15:38
Can I borrow your crystal ball..... Surely you only have an educated guess where its going! But I agree its not where the most profitable returns are! BUT on that a lots of money will be made and lost on other altcoins, and Bitcoin may be the "dare I say it", most stable of coins?
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:22:29
Need to speed that process up... A LOT!
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:12:43
I use a cryptopay card. 
Fees were £10 to get one and 1-2% loading fee depending where its loaded from.
Accepted where ever visa is. 
I load Btc to there website and it goes up and down with the markets. As soon as I load my card with a few mBTC that stops going up or down and is converted into fiat. 
Works fine, I had £300 in Btc on there 4 weeks ago now I have £360 :-) free shopping...
I only spend a little to help the community grow but I hold my investment BTC elsewhere :-)
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:33:28
Are should be someone buying on the dip :-) like me
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:18:34
Fiat was NOT run on debt until banks got hold of it! Banks see the change as well. Someone is going to loose big, either bitconers or banks..! 
Even banks want rid of paper and coins! They want all transaction electronic, that's why I hold a few xrp! How big can Btc go ??? But as I say to everyone holding even a small amount is better then none! We are in an electronic age and a new kind of money is here! Crypto currency and get some when you can!
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:30:21
You can, get a Btc debit card!
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:10:53
That is without hedge funds coming in, which MAY half the time scale, it MAY further increase in value because of the short supply of new coins coming in...
BUT in defence I do think that blockchain is under valued.... By a lot!
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:42:18
Lol... Good luck with that :-)
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:48:57
I use a Btc debit card... Yay, I know its ends up been fiat on a pre paid card but it keeps the wheels turning on the space ship, and when LN / micro payments and more shops accept Btc it will have to do :-)
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:34:16
I still spend some on trade route for Mary Jane, it helps make sure I keep buying Btc...

Maybe, but I think with the year micro payments will be a thing and I can drop it, as for now the government Rather then chasing my tax has Brexit to deal with and the impending collapse of the euro and maybe the dollar! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:26:22
Just get a Btc debit card and buy the stuff you need, keep your as much of that 1 Btc as you can, if it carries on at 700% pa then 1000 * 7 = £$7000 year 1
7000 * 7 =£$49,000 year 2
49k * 7 = £$343,000 year 3

Umm lots of different opinions on best way to buy! I use coinbase to buy but then transfer to a mobile wallet. BUT I also have accounts with bitbargain &amp; coinfloor, I also have accounts with poloniex an exchange so I can exchange for other coins that I speculate with, potcoin, siacoin, ripple and more.. I also have a jaxx wallet to store multiple other alt coins on like ethereum, litecoin and doge coin. But for ease and noobs a coinbase account for buying and jaxx wallet for storing is a great start! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:55:00

@_date: 2017-08-27 09:03:15
I would not wait, just jump in if you want to hodl. As 'cash in' lol... I use a crypto dedit card and take small amounts of profit for weekly shopping. I have a slush fund of £400 worth of Bitcoin and when it gets to £440 I transfer £40 to my debit card and spend that... Wait another month and I hope it goes up another £40... I have had about £200 out at the moment :-)

Maybe less! This is just the start, when mass adoption starts 2018 IMO some coins will rocket 1000's of % Bitcoin over 2 years did 2963% and is it not some silly figure like 0.3% of the population own Bitcoin and its value is £7k I would say in five years. But I am as mad as a hatter!

Love the doge!
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:06:57
£1m per coin far fetched ..  Even at £1m per coin it would still be under valued. Bitcoin is changing the world... Banks are jumping it, hedge funds start Jan 18, cem's start on wall street by Christmas.... The amount of dumb money heading into crypto$ is massive, Btc alone is already bigger then PayPal and has just started coming mainstream which is still a year down the road, the swiss government is accepting Btc !!! It will be big and we should not write off £1m coins
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:42:41

'Dumb' money 
I class dumb money as hedge funds and any other Monet that is invested to can company to look after then these guys invest in crypto$, any money coming in is smart money! Dumb money is just a name for money invested where the original investor is unsure where it will be invested! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:59:53
I am bias as I own a cryptopay.me debit card here in the UK. As they also do a euro card and works well for me! 
I pay £1 per month and load around about £40-£100 when needed, there is a £16k per day load limit and you pay 1-2% load fee, as I store a few mBtc on my account I pay the lower 1%
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:14:27
At £1million per coin I would still class it as under valued ! You believe in block chain tech, it is going to dominate the news for I guess the next decade. For the millions and millions people who are denied access to a bank account, a mobile wallet and an internet connection is all you need, with the development of block chain satellites transmitting the blocks down, £100k is super cheap! The value is in the 21 quadrillion satoshis  .... With lighting network, luunino, rootstock, atomic swaps and more coming q1 2018 £100k still under valued.. IMO :-) I hope it works out for you all in or out!
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:48:54

The millions and millions of people without a bank account will need money or Btc unsure if 20t will be enough.  ...

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:34:53
In the UK, I used bitbargain.co.uk it was OK but a lot of setting up different sellers , but you can buy more there, I have been with CB for some time now and they do increase limits I had been with them a bit and I emailed them and I had to verify my address with a utility bill but they did up my limit to £2.5k per week, like who has that kinda of money ... !
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:12
You can buy ownership of that pease of the block, you can hold onto it and hope the price goes up ( we are speculating the value goes up) or you can trade the ownership of that piece of the block for goods and services... Miners validate your transactions and get rewarded with new Bitcoin...!
When all Bitcoin are mined, the miners will still receive transactions fees... 
Winner winner chicken dinner!

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:09:39
I kind of agree and have you tried getting your money out? I have! and do take little bits of profit when I need it.

Bitcoin over last 1 year 1000%
Bitcoin over last 2 years 3000%

At 400% = £28k
At 1000% = £70k
At 1500% = £105k
At 2000% = £140k
I am going for 2000% .. Why not ? Lots of interesting news and developments over the next few week / months

After saving Btc and some other crypto$ for 3 years my first one was £150... Wish I bought more, but after saving for 3 years I sent £1000 to a crypto$ debit card... Every time I have £1100 in that account I treat myself with £100 ... But it really helps and I don't have to dip into my proper Btc savings!

@_date: 2017-11-17 00:45:06
Not as I understand it! I use coinbase to purchase Btc and they cash you out by bank transfer to a bank account! Then you do what you want with that fiat! 
For cashing out a little profit I send my Btc to a bitcoin debit card(cryptopay.me works for me) and it works just like a visa card, everywhere takes it, even has the visa sign on it! 2% load fee and £1 per month they charge.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:03:08
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:25:22
I thought that they would have to back the contract with Btc, can settle in fiat, but I would guess that you would need Btc to make the contract.
Under my understanding a futures contract of let's say with 10 Btc in it, a futures contract allow to sell 5 btc at a set contract price and the other 5 at market price!
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:47:12
This is simple way, maybe not the cheapest.

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:21:03
Pros and cons, using a bank account you may get a better price IF there is a dip, debit card is instant and you may catch a spike... Either way price overall is going up... I have done both but my preference is instant debit card. Here in the UK I have used bitbargain.co.uk they use bank transfer but you have to set up each new seller up in your banking app .. Takes about 30 mins each trade...!  
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:17
In the UK, if you were to draw I think £11.5k per year with no other income its below your tax limit and 0% tax to be paid..

Most people know the answer to your question but if this is your first purchase what makes you want to join in?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:01:03
It's a start CB is a good place to start...people I have introduced to Bitcoin normally start buying small amounts on CB while reading up about Bitcoin... Then when they are happy about its speculation value based on its technical and moral standings they normally move there money somewhere safe! Fees are a problem but in time these will come down AND least we not forget it is a store of wealth

I use cryptopay card. Its fine. When you login you have a Btc address and a US$, euro address and a £ address, when you store your Btc with them the value goues up and down... Only when you transfer btc to your card does it lock it into fiat and the value stays the same, you can load and unload the card up to £16k per day
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:55:01
Yet the Europeans are at war with Fiat currency, I hear they are getting rid of the 500 euro note and the US thinking of getting rid of the $100 bill, making it more difficult to use cash for larger transactions, I fear they will try and sell a fedcoin or a bank backed coin, but this will only allow them to money grab as I guess you won't be holding your private keys... 2018 is going to be more exciting then 2017 :-)
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:59:10
Already do that!
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:56:59
I use one! Its a quick way to draw profits! Just send Btc to an address, it converts Btc to fiat, and you can spend where a normal visa debit card is accepted! You get the going rate for selling, but its quick!

With me, I hold £400 worth of Btc in my Btc cryptopay.me slush account. When Btc on the up, eg, £440 I transfer to the debit card side of the account where it is locked in at that exchange rate! Its accepted wherever visa is, and has a load limit of £16k per day.... Yippeee 
But cost me £10 upfront and £1 per month 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:05:25
I have a slush fund of let's say £400 in Btc, when the value goes up to let's say £440, I transfer £40 worth of Btc to the debit to the debit card, spend the profit and wait for to to go up again
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:40:03
To me its a clone! People want to speculate on it to make money! Its cheap! But banks are looking at the tech and not the coin XRP. It will be a ledger owned by banks! Invest or don't !

Purchase a btc credit card! Load it with you weekly or monthly spend +10% or more if you can. Use this card alone to pay for your normal stuff and remember anything you don't spend will increase in value (or decrease) but I would say it will increase!

I ordered a Bitcoin credit card. Deposit Btc and when used anywhere taking visa they convert my preloaded Btc to fiat and pay the shop! If Btc price goes up :-) my spending power goes up, if price goes down :-( I loose spending power. If I load it with my normal monthly spend, and I economise I should be able to transfer to my slush Btc address.
IF like over the three weeks Btc spike I will rush out and stock up on food etc and will be able to leave wages in the bank,, or buy Btc on the drop!

@_date: 2017-05-29 14:18:08
Bitbargain.co.UK is where I get mine from! Its not as instant as coinbase etc and you have to be involved, takes about 10 mins to buy as bitbargain hold sellers Btc until you transfer money via pingit /pyc or bank transfer within the UK (free) + others when seller confirms payment Btc transferred to your wallet, and then you can send them where you want!

But if you and your assets are worth more then $10k YOU are a monetary instrument! Including any monetary equity in your house, you should declare yes!

I invested 25% on my portfolio in crypto currency two years ago, now my crypto £ went up 997% and my bank deposits did not rise 0% and I am worth more inside the internet then out. ( excluding equality in my house)

I got mine last year! You probably paid less then me ��

I ordered a Bitcoin debit card, so I will buy Btc each week and load an amount on it, and because it is accepted like a normal visa card, it should encourage me to ensure that I buy each month and I will be able to buy my coffee / groceries etc and at the end of the said month I should have some left for my investment :-) holding them and spending them ... Win win
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:26:50
OK I have found a solution... 
I ordered a Btc debit card (cryptopay.me) says its £15 but cost me £10 :-)
I will be transferring Btc to it and they are accepted where visa and MasterCard are accepted :-) online as well. 
My plan is to put my monthly spend in Btc + 10-20% and economize at the shops so my Btc balance will grow each month leaving my 2014 Btc purchase to appreciate in value :-)

Lol ditto.... Drops £400 ... Just another Bitcoin day!

You can only judge a shithole by the turds that pass through it,.... And Europe is full of turds!.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:12:05
Even cryptopay debit cards, !!?? I wish I had 10k to be carrying around like loose change... Maybe one day!
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:31:26
£15 to buy, I paid with Btc and it cost only £10.
There are fees, but low. Keep your bank debit card to draw fiat when needed. Surly its a no brainer!

Love the doge... Go on boy!
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:46:36
I have ordered one... How smug will I be spending a few Btc in the shops :-)
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:39:40
I still spend on there :-) but I always over buy Btc and save a little :-)
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:56:08
I care.....! As I need the know when the Bitcoin sale will be so I can buy more :-)
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:14:10
That's to much information schhhhhh
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:03:20
Bitcoin /Siacoin / ripple / lumins / potcoin :-) and ETH that should edge my bets :-)
Been in it two years and I am a hodl :-) working OK for me and you are never to late I think we are about to start on that Bitcoin 's' curve
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:16:26
Hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:25:38
I understand but I am on a limited budget and would love to have fiat for shopping and btc for investment. I hope that because I will be using Btc daily it will help me collect the extra bits.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:46:56
But we are all wiser now, a lot more people hodl.... A dip yes but the crash days are over! I hope! 
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:04:37
Doge coin! I transfered some and the fee 1 doge coin and it was fast... Like super fast...!
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:06:33
Use a crypto debit card! Mine is on its way
I load with Btc, it has chip and pin, accepted where visa sign is. The amount in Btc is converted to (fiat) and paid to the vendor. Leaving the rest of my coin to increase in value, or decrease! :-)
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:57:11
I think they have bigger things to worry about. I have purchased from the darkweb, and my parcel of 10g of herbs was ordered from the dam and was intercepted by customs. I was advised that I could contest the find in court or if I did not contact tgem, my parcel would be destroyed.... I never heard anything else about it, the boys in blue never even came!
This is how I became interested in Btc, I remember buying the seat £150 per coin, shame I spent so many :-( 
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:42:04
I use coinfloor! And bitbargain in the uk
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:11:25
:-) I bought £300 worth of Btc and loaded it on my Btc debit card, after all fees :-( I had £288 left... After 1 week it was worth £338, so trip to the shops and bought my food for the week ..£30 leaving £308 on my card, hey ho shopping for free :-) and still £308 on my card, if it goes up this week .. More free shopping for me :-) 
Or value will go gown and I will have to use my fiat debit card... Until price goes up :-)
