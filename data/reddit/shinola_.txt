It'll be tough to not sell at the 50k price point  
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:33
It's not literal. It's a ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:24:54
Sold half of mine back at 2000 to pay off student loans. Still sitting pretty but fuck me I feel like an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:42:11
Why the fuck anybody who bought in in the last two months would think they have ANYTHING of value to add to this conversation is beyond me. 
"Just bought $500 worth a week ago, I think we're about to see a  dip guys." 
Shut the fuck up. You're dumbing down this sub.

Still pending....

"The bitcoin" lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:36
You're just butt hurt you lost money in crypto and now you want it to fail because you're holding a grudge against crypto for your own failings lmao. You don't know the future
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:10:41
Nobody wants to answer this question lol

Bought in at $400 this ain't shiiiiit ��

I sent .3btc to my gdax account from my bread wallet right before the crash and it is still pending.....
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:07:20
This is such a good point and I've asked the question before to silence. Can you actually sell 55 bitcoin at once? And it would take over a year to withdraw that fiat from all the reputable exchanges I am aware of. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:01
Your post history says otherwise champ.

I sold some regrettably at $2000 to pay off student loans. Still have enough that this latest ride has been very exciting. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:09:40
So tempting to sell my investment to finish off my student loans but HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:58:42
Definitely bitter he didn't buy 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:39:06
lol I rarely open gdax or coinbase. When you've been riding this roller coaster for a while you start sleeping through the drops.

@_date: 2017-09-02 12:49:40
Thanks for the help homie. Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:53:11
Any way you could point me in the direction of how I can find out how to redeem the bch without compromising my bitcoin holdings? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:00:16
I'm still confused on how to move more than $15k at once. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:51:46
I use bread wallet so I assume I can't 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:51:18
How does this work? I have coins in my own wallet does this mean I have extra coins now in bitcoin cash? I don't understand 
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:10:48
Sell some and buy a house. That's my plan. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:41:36
For me a house is just securing a portion of my investment regardless of market forces as well as the intangible peace of mind a paid off house provides. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:56:36
I keep asking but no one is telling me. How do you cash out a large sum? Coinbase limits you to $15k sells per week. If you want to move a good amount, say $100k you're fucked to price changes over a 6 week period. Is there an exchange that lets you sell higher amounts or another way? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:41:36
I sold some to pay off my student loans. It's bitter sweet. Feels good to have that monkey off my back basically for free but I miss the coins ��
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:48:55
I'm hoping for $300 coins. I'm salivating. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:09:21
I sold a bit during this swing to pay off my student loans. Still kept a fair amount in bitcoin. Once the cash arrives (I sold a bit more than I needed for the loan) I plan to buy more bitcoin, hopefully at a discount. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:02:36
Ah ok, I just thought it was a loosely worded boondocks reference 
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:12:10
Is that a boondocks reference? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:56:06
I still don't understand how anyone became rich in the bubble if you can only sell $15k worth at a time. I feel like I'm going to get fucked out of a lot of money if I have to liquidate over a number of weeks. What the fuck is the solution????
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:42:24
There has to be exchanges without sell limits tho?
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:04:06
Well to be fair some financial advisors would advocate for NOT buying the house in full, taking the mortgage, and allocating the funds elsewhere where they can work better for you, rather than locking them in the home for X amount of years. 
If you want a baller crib, a mortgage is the way to go over renting. Yes, a majority of the payment is interest but you're still getting more return than renting. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:00:03
How do you cash out that much bitcoin when coinbase has $15k per week sell limits? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:14:38
Whats wrong with cashing out and buying the dip for more coin? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:35:31
I still have coins just not as much. But yes you're right. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:33:53
I'm praying for 1250 hopefully I didn't fuck myself. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:12:27
I still don't understand how to sell large sums. Coinbase has me at  a $15k per week limit. It would take me weeks to cash out now and if the rise continues, months. Is there a way to actually cash out a large sum? How did people get rich during the bubble if you could only move $15k per week. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:57:31
Cool story bro. I could give a fuck
