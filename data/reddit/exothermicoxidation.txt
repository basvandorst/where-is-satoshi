Yes, you could buy bitcoin and the seller gives it to you by opening a channel with you. But other comments here made me realize a couple of things - in the long term, neither you nor the exchange will want this topology. You might want to have more than one channel and the exchange will want fewer. What if the exchange servers crash? You'll need to close the channel to use the funds. And so will everyone else. Better to close the channel or at least open another one before that happens. And the exchange wants to move funds to cold wallets and might not want to maintain all those channels - if there are millions of them, it might be unwieldy

He didn't take the direct route (otherwise fees would be zero). More nodes mean more possible paths, more competition, less fees.

A pruning node doesn't prune immediately, so it still forwards blocks and therefore participates in the general consensus. But it can't help new nodes catch up

If a hard fork doesn't support segwit, they're reverted to anyone-can-spend. Or are permanently locked. Or can spend to one hard-coded address. Or whatever crazy rules the non-segwit hard fork decides.
On the same tune, a hard-fork can change the rules so that you, specifically, don't get the forked coins. We'll call it NoTeknic111Coin!

No, I mean the private key. If you don't have the private key to the address, it's not your address. I saw on another post of yours that it's coinbase's address? Then they need to send the coins

Currently the fees for segwit transactions are lower but they take less block weight so you can put more of them in a block, that kind of cancels out - if it were more profitable to choose a non-segwit transaction and there was one to choose, you would.
If all transactions were segwit, there would be less congestion which can kill (or, rather, suspend) the fee market if the mempool clears entirely.
OTOH, if demand goes up you're back to competing for room on the blockchain and paying fees, segwit or not.
If you're a miner who thinks transaction demand will go up, you'd prefer segwit adoption because more transactions at the same fees as today means more profit

A pruning node still holds a database of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) - this is kept separately from the blockchain, in 'chainstate' - completely unaffected by pruning, as it is needed for validating transactions.
When pruning was added in 0.11, it was mutually exclusive with wallet mode, which makes such a node pretty useless. Version 0.12 allows running a wallet in pruning mode. Any other functionality (txindex, second wallet) would require re-downloading the full chain

Average load is 0.7 - it was running on one of the cores 70% of the time? Or am I missing something? That sounds insanely high
1.5gb memory includes a full node, or just lnd? Either way it's not bad

Back then, and now, mining a block is its own reward. When block reward goes close to 0, there must be tx fees for anyone to be able to mine without hemmoraging money

I thought it was about pushing LN to "3rd layer" and having side chains or something as 2nd layer. Basically making the opening/closing cheaper by using something that's pegged to the bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:04:07
In a segwit transaction, all inputs are represented as one hash in the non-witness section? I thought only the signature moved, and the input specification (utxo enumeration?) stays the same
Is it much cheaper, then, relatively, to use many small inputs, if they're all segwit?

It's pessimistic in assuming a change address for every transaction, but it's also optimistic in assuming all batches are true batches - some people out there are obfuscating their transactions by spreading the output over multiple outputs and multiple change addresses.

The bitcoin is sent to a multisig address, which is the channel. When you buy the second 0.25btc, the first already moved (to Binance).
The other detail here is that Coinbase has a large channel open to someone (Binance, Walmart, someone). If people keep buying from Coinbase and spending elsewhere, it'll need to be replenished.

There's no random number generation as part of signing?
edit: elliptic curve signatures require a different unique random number to be used in every signature. Using the same twice can reveal the private key, but is very visible. but choosing them carefully can seem like signatures are well-formed but leak some information in each signature. unless the code uses a deterministic method of generating these which can be verified, you're trusting the hardware to be keeping your secrets, even if the only world-visible information are the signatures it generates)

You have the private key associated with the old address? Then why can't you pay with it?
If you want to transfer, import that private key into a wallet and transfer
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:25:30
From the [wiki]( you can use a k value which is determined (by hashing) from the transaction data, but you're also allowed to use a "random" number. If the hardware wallet does not demonstrate how it chooses k when signing, it can leak info
Such an attack is described [here](

Fees go up, miners see more $$$, they switch back, block rate goes back up (to 10 minute or close to it). It'd be an equilibrium if fees were a major part of the block reward. Currently the base reward is still very high

On one hand, a blockchain provides distributed storage and high uptime, and Ethereum might provide load balancing. On the other hand, no I don't think you can run something very big on a blockchain. Or, as Ethereum would scale/load-balance, sharding, on a thousand block chains. You'd need millions which makes it unfeasible.
But a blockchain is very good in the first two properties, if you can get the rest of the required properties elsewhere

Could you have BTC in an LN channel without an opening transaction at all? You'd still establish a committing transaction with the other side, but that transaction has to be funded from somewhere (from committed funds).
It could be funded from a non-LN address, if you trust the other party enough (as they can run off with it at any time by sending the coins in a regular transaction).
It sounds pretty bad, but you'd be the only one affected by this counter-party risk - whenever you pay someone by routing through this channel, your counter-party is the one doing the actual payment (reducing the amount of bitcoin he can run off with).
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:33:37
It is (especially when your peer is as well-connected as an exchange would be) and they could, but up to a point. At a million channels, they might need specialized software to handle it, and/or more hardware, and is it worth it? I'm not familiar with the details (hope to be soon, once I set up lnd on testnet), but let's imagine it takes 1ms to test a block for a transaction that's relevant to your channel. A regular node would need 2-4ms per block. A node with a million channels will not finish processing a block before another one comes out.
But I think my previous point, which wasn't mine but raised elsewhere in this thread, is stronger: you don't want your funds tied up to the same peer as a million other users. If they go down it'll be expensive and/or take weeks to get your funds.

Is there any randomness involved in signing a transaction? That would allow an air-gapped hardware wallet to slowly leak your private key

Comparable to S3 - in data size and cost? No way. In reliability? Yes.
I didn't know people think it can be used for distributed computing of the kind you'd need a large cloud cluster for. It obviously can't, at least not for anything remotely resembling a reasonable price. All the examples of smart contracts I've seen are simple scripts - escrow, voting polls, small simple stuff

If there are less transactions than room in a block (i.e. backlog is 0), why wouldn't the fee be 0 sat/byte? Or 1 sat per tx?
I guess miners will set a minimum fee regardless of block room

I wasn't referring to someone purposefully misbehaving, actually. I was referring to someone losing power/internet/etc for a long time. The two are very similar (the difference is a misbehaving peer is trying to steal your coins, while an offline peer is just offline)
BTW, you're encouraged to play fairly or risk losing the funds in the channel you misbehave about. You won't lose funds in other channels.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:04:33
You can CPFP it (with Electrum wallet, or possibly any wallet that allows spending unconfirmed coins). It's expensive since you need another transaction with enough fees to pay for both, but when 40 sat/byte gets you in the next block it's reasonable even for moving 30$
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:06:41
I don't see how. Miners will fill up the 1mb block by taking the highest paying transactions first and not care about how full or empty the witness section is. Note that a pruning node doesn't need to ever keep any witness data

There is a problem with very large hubs, which is the disruption which would be caused if one goes offline or misbehaves or sets routing fees so high that too many people want to leave. In the first and third case, you get a ton of transactions trying to make their way on-chain. In the second one there's a race as people try to publish punishment txs while others try to close before they'll have to.
There's an upside, too - a huge hub can only cheat as fast as the blockchain allows

I'm not sure what you're asking. If you're asking whether getting bitcoin on the blockchain ('move them outside an LN channel') requires a blockchain transaction, then yes.
If you want to buy Bitcoin to use in LN, it might be possible to do so with a single transaction - the seller opens a channel with you, and transfers the bitcoin over the channel.
The short version of that is that you can open a channel where one party commits 0 BTC, so that party's address doesn't need to have any history.
That's my understanding - I am not an LN expert.

If it takes a month to publish all the punitive transactions, it also took a month to publish all the old-state closing transactions.

To first receive bitcoin, if you don't have any, would require a blockchain transaction.
Unless: You open a 0btc channel with the exchange, where the exchange commits N btc (N == the amount you bought minus that transaction's fees) and sends you the btc on the channel. Now you can spend it on LN or close the channel to get the coins on the blockchain.
From 0 to LN in one transaction!

Best practice is to make the chain resistant to history rewriting (51% attack) and censorship (by allowing anyone to "mine" or make users so obfuscated it's impossible to know what to censor). Worst practice is to make incentives aligned so that selfish actors naturally conspire to attack the network or the coin on it

Meltdown or Spectre only apply to local code (they're not remote vulnerabilities). As long as you're not executing remote code (like JavaScript) you're safe. AFAIK Spectre isn't solved, but is mitigated in browsers. Meltdown was fixed by a kernel update (kernel memory is not mapped in when userspace is running)
