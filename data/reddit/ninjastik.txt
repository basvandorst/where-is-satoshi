This is great news!
I'm wondering how they will handle post checkout charges?  I know most places require you provide a credit card as a security against phone calls / damages / room service etc.
I'm really disappointed that the so called 'professional journalist' didn't ask this most obvious of questions.

As I mentioned over in r/BitcoinMarkets - I think the size of the fee / charge is designed to get attention which in turn will further ensure that people share it which in turn gets the word out.  It certainly is more effective than just putting out a press release and much cheaper too.
If the cost of petrol was about to jump $250 a month you'd tell everyone you knew with a car about it.... and then buy shares in bicycle companies :-)

I started accepting Bitcoin only a few weeks ago, but the response has been pretty amazing.  So far roughly 10% are Bitcoin and the rest are still CC and Paypal.

I use Electrum and having that seed phrase is a nice bit of insurance, especially on a laptop or other device that is susceptible to theft or physical damage.
One feature that hasn't been mentioned yet - since Electrum is not downloading the entire blockchain, it is really easy to use behind TOR.  Trying to download 6 gigs though TOR would be painful to say the least.  Electrum has a very simple interface that allows you to route the connection through TOR or any proxy you like in seconds.
