Hey, don't worry, we've all been there. Yes, I'd recommend Blockchain, that's a pretty solid wallet to begin with - but you gotta be careful, my friend. Here are some safety begginer tips, please take a look: 
 Anyway, if you are going to HODL for the long run, I'd suggest you to learn more about paper wallet or hardware wallet. These are the safest to store big values. Meanwhile, yes, you can use blockchain, mostly for smaller transactions.

Well, this is a trick question. It depends pretty much on your investor profile!  
Are you in for the short term? Do you want to trade, get profit and get out? If so, set your profit goal before you get in, and also set a stop loss! (Like -15% of the initial, or like if your profit is 100% you take out your initial investment and keep the rest invested, for instance!)  
Are you in for the long run? So don't worry much about it. Keep contributing a few bucks every month, and you decide what to do in the long run - will you use the coins for their real purpose? Or you just want them to moon and go back to fiat?  
It's really up to you!

You see, when you generate a new bitcoin (or any other) wallet, you are generating two (or three) keys. The most used one will be your public key - this one will be used as your "adress". When you want to receive coins in this wallet, i.e. if you want to send some coins to it, you will be sharing your PUBLIC key. Now, there is also a PRIVATE key. Your PRIVATE key will be the only way of acessing your crypto wallet. Whenever you want to send your coins to other wallets, you will be entering your PRIVATE key. TLDR: you'll use your PUBLIC key to receive coins, and your PRIVATE key to send coins. Do not share your private key with anyone, and store it somewhere safe (could be a paper wallet, where you will possess a paper within your private key and store it somewhere safe in your home, maybe) or even a hardware wallet, that looks like a pen drive and stores your coins. Anyway, go to the link of my previous comment and you will find different types of wallets, each one has it's pros and cons... it's really up to you.

Seems legit

A secure way would simply use her/your public wallet adress or print the QR code so people can make transactions to the wallet. 
Also, talking about wallet security, you could have either a hardware cold wallet or a paper wallet for the best protection. Here you can find more info on wallets:

Coin4coin - I really appreciate your help buddy! After doing many many things, I'm not sure which one got it working, but the RPC calls are correctly getting thourhg the SSH server!  
I'm just trying to fix the default data folder right now, because when I run bitcoind the data folder is being set up as /root/.bitcoin so I'm having to log in as root user to make bitcoind work correctly.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:21:14
Thanks for the reply! I've made sure that is the only bitcoind running.
As I've said to the comment above, there's some strange things going on with my bitcoind... when I run `bitcoind` in the terminal, it's always using /root/.bitcoin folder as default, so it always look up at the bitcoin.conf file in that folder...
After figuring out this problem with /root/ folder, now I got the binding to work out with no failures, no error messages being thrown! But now I'm trying to make RPC calls and getting Connection refused. :(
`Failed to connect to 192.168.xx.xxx port 18334: Connection refused.`
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:16:45
Thanks for the reply! So I've just noticed there's something weird going on...
When I run bitcoind, it shows me this (which is definetely the correct path for my bitcoin.conf):
`2019-05-16T17:43:46Z Using config file /home/bitcoin-dev/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`
And I've put test.rpcport=18334 to test the binding in the 18334 port...
but when I run bitcoind again, the same port has failed to bind:
`Binding RPC on address` `0.0.0.0` `port 18332 failed.`
Just as bitcoind ignored my bitcoin.conf ...
So I figured out when bitcoind starts running, the default bitcoin directory folder is set to `/root/.bitcoin`, even when this `"Using config file ..."` message appears... and that was somehow messing up with everything.
Doesn't matter what config I'm using in`/home/bitcoin-dev/.bitcoin.` Bitcoind always is using data inside my /root/.bitcoin.
Anyway, I've changed my root bitcoin.conf and now I'm trying to make RPC calls I'm getting `Failed to connect to 192.168.xx.xxx port 18334: Connection refused.`
It just never ends :(
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:24:49
Yes sir, a few days ago I managed to make it work running under root, but now connection gets refused even when doing so...
I've made sure that no bitcoind instances are running, too (I've stopped in root with `bitcoin-cli stop` and tried to stop in normal user but it said there was no bitcoind server running).
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:52:55
I've tried to reboot a few times, still getting
`Failed to connect to 192.168.xx.xxx port 18334: Connection refused.`
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:00:45
Using terminal with root privileges:
`sudo su`
Running bitcoind in background:
`bitcoind -daemon`
And logging the debug to see what's going on:
`tail -f debug.log` (inside the folder in which the debug file is located)
