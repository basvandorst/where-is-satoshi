what good will finding the pendrive do? i have no idea where it is. there is a small chance i still have it but it is likely someone in my family tossed it or lost it as it was a cheap used usb stick.

at first i did resent her and fault her for it but ultimately it is my mom and i dont blame anyone else but myself for allowing it to happen... it is what it is i guess

i mean its been over 5 years that shit is as existent as my girlfriend i dont have

she knows based off of how i reacted to all of it and my brief explanation that it had millions of dollars worth of value on it, but not about bitcoin, shes too old minded to really understand what that is, basically she just knows my old laptop had “online money” stored on it from how i explained it to her when it initially happened, i really never brought it up or talked to her about it since it actually happened in 2014 when i found out she threw the laptop away

yeah man, over the years, laptops, old consoles like nintendo 64’s, wii’s, gamecube’s all have gone into the trash because she just categorized it as junk, its whatever
