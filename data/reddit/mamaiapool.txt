Bitcoin is in the air
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:05:50
So we are going to have Cryptocurrency PhD soon
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:08:23
you've had a problem with paying bitcoin at LJ?
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:06:39
there's no other option, but WebRTC which isn't quite there yet for established business like that
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:10:17
Click "Join now" link then specify Bitcoins as payment method
@_date: 2015-07-11 09:01:13
i don't see any online models there.
also i can't say if they have free chat mode
there many fake sites with pre-recorded shows.
while the one in OP has like 1,000 models online and chat free as long as u like it

Russian govn is famous for stupid things

Apparently LiveJasmin isn't the biggest cam and not the only cam accepting bitcoins. I've did a research on that and found those cams where u can pay with Bitcoins
ExtasyCams (European)
 (French and German)
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:06:46
I wish more restaurants accept bitcoin. Merchants across the world are slow so far(
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:54:04
Adult industry slowly but surely implements Bitcoin as payment option
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:44:56
like 3 months or so
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:46:02
they have xhamsterpremium with bulk DVD content. 
the main xhamster site is packed with stolen content they can't sell so they don't get sued. so they use main site to generate traffic while promote  xhamsterpremium with cheap outdated DVD movies and accept bitcoins there next to CCs

i guess most people did drugs, but they are not going to post it here

congrats everyone)
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:55:00
Would really like to see some action, since that phrase is for years in air, but things are not there yet
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:16:07

@_date: 2015-07-22 10:16:46
good for him. he did it once it was the right thing to do
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:33:25
some big adult companies have dropped it already because of lack of transactions
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:30:15
what for?
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:59:21
it'll save you some money LOL
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:16:54
yeah. just found that out as well. 
good news anyway
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:46:41
those things never get easy ;)
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:38:02
that site packed with unexclusive content has little to no daily traffic. can't speak that much for an industry
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:28:33
1) it was 10 years ago while people were hypercurious about it. 10 years later it just boring stuff. people got that Bangbros isn't real LOL (c) that popular youtube video 
You can't also be more wrong on other statements in your post. It's just totally wrong in every aspect of it
2) I've did a research on that and found those cams where u can pay with Bitcoins 
ExtasyCams (European)

@_date: 2015-07-13 10:01:48
I don't see that much of slowdown for EUR 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:05:26
There're many cam istes accepting bitcoins already
  
 (French and German)
 aka LiveJasmin
Looks like only Chaturbate drops it 
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:03:53
does it have any models online?
i was lazy to register just to check out
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:06:35
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:55:40

@_date: 2015-07-13 10:08:08

@_date: 2015-07-13 10:19:14
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:07:04

@_date: 2015-07-12 17:02:23
they dropped bitcoins. at least i don't see it anywhere on the site. i'm doing research on it now
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:26:49
If all porn companies start doing that it would be a huge hit for Bitcoin. It's very important that Naughty America also invests hard in Virtual Reality Porn:
They are just rolling this business while other are sleeping
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:54:28
nice to this such sort of a progress
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:50:30
probably not since it would be to hard for models to operate bitcoins
