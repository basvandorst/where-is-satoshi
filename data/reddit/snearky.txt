Perhaps escrow and/or group reputation. What other solutions might work?

I would say it's certainly for profit, but not in the put food in the table sense. Any trade that both parties leave happy is always profitable or at least desirable. 
I have no intent in building and maintaining a competing marketplace. More a place for players who are bitcoin users, to have easy bitcoin trade. I may be fun to try different things like having a pool that pays out to the team who does the best in a ranked match in a set period of time. OR tipping people small amounts for the assists they give you.
I suppose it depends most on what people find to be fun.

The goal, at this point is to have more than just a bitcoin dota fanclub. A place where in game btc trades and transfers can happen. can But I certainly want it to still be a normal clan too with games.
Building a marketplace, perhaps.. I'm quite open at this point to the direction of the guild as this is a new idea and is still building form.

Dota 2 is a marketplace based game. For me, trading/buying/selling in the digital marketplace is really fun and adds a lot to a game I already liked. Including btc is only a natural extension of the game, and I'm hoping others think so too.

I think there is a lot of value in finding where BTC and Dota 2 marketplace can meet.
