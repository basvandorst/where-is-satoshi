Hmmmm, 500,000BTC traded each day out of 13,500,000 in circulation... That's 3.7%. 
Let's now compare that to the $5.3 trillion dollars in currency traded each day out of the global currency circulation of [$10.5 trillion as the broadest measure of money supply]( which is 50.4%. 
(Your argument is erroneous)

This is the inherent issue. "HODLING". 




These types of services need to be a part of bitcoin if it is ever to strive. Luckily these types of things are starting to develop like the services provided by coinkite and circle, but there's still a lot of ground to cover. 
If EVERYONE were to "HODL" what good would bitcoin be? Who would use it? Your bitcoins should be able to be lent out for a fair percentage to other people when needed while you're not using them. Keeping them stashed under your mattress isn't helping the bitcoin economy. AT ALL.

Not enough people realize this when they CONSTANTLY compare it to other fiat currencies. And I would also love a source for statement, since just with the [Foreign Exchange Market $5.3 trillion dollars was traded each **day**]( in 2013.

**You**  can call it whatever you want, but don't say *us*. I most likely hold and utilize more bitcoins than you do. I'm not badgering, and you shouldn't much assumptions either and be a little less critical.
I've been part of this community for a long time and I just get sick of all the "hope-ium" that get's spread around and upvoted and anything that is remotely critical or objective gets immediately downvoted. There are a lot of real world issues that need to be addressed and ironed out and the continuous circlejerk on what new bitcoin ATM got installed somewhere in the world isn't going to help much.

Seriously? That's like saying you dropped an egg, but waited to see if it was broken for 20 years. It ceases to exists as soon as it's destroyed. Not because you *chose* to wait 20 years to check. Your comparison is amazingly ignorant. 


The act of holding isn't do ANYTHING. It contributes NOTHING towards the bitcoin economy. It is your own investment strategy, and that's fine, but if EVERYONE did this what would happen? What good would bitcoin be if no one used it. Holding is fine, but lending services should be implemented so that others can use it when you're not and you get a fair return for that service, thus encouraging the utility of bitcoin. 


You haven't shown ANYTHING! I should have stopped listening to you after your ridiculous 20 year broken HD anology, but I'm definitely not reading another word after reading TWICE that you actually believe holding lowers supply! HAHAHAHAHA, pleaseeeeee go take an economics course or read an economics book. The money in my pocket that I *could* store indefinitely doesn't lower the total supply - burning it, shredding it, chewing it up and eating it does!! 
Wow... you gave me the biggest face palm I'll probably experience all day. Shaking my head...

How did you set up a buy order on Coinbase? As far as I knew you couldn't set up buy/sell orders on Coinbase since it isn't a "true" exchange. Did they just very recently implement this tool?

So Satoshi is only worth $210 million USD? I thought the Satoshi bitcoin stash was worth more than that. 
According to this article, [US Taxpayers lost $105 million on pennies and nickles last year.](  
But this is also misleading as a user would have to use the coins once and throw them away to have a negative impact like that on the economy - which is obviously not the case. 
Also, the [US Mint **made** $512 million through their numismatic program]( selling coins to collectors last year - which was up 6% from the previous year.

I hate when people use this comparison. Everyone in so desperately wants bitcoins to be taken seriously as a *currency*. If you want it to be seen as a currency STOP comparing it to a commodity! 
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:24:16
This is wrong on so many levels. Just because they aren't moving doesn't mean it lowers the supply. They *could* enter the market at any time. And if enough did at the same time it could wreck havoc on the market. Never mind the million+ bitcoins Satoshi has looming over our heads... Holding may be your investment strategy, but it doesn't help the bitcoin economy. AT ALL. Lending services need to be developed so that when you're not using them someone else can and you earn a fair percentage for lending it out. What good are bitcoins if no one uses them? 
@_date: 2014-11-24 15:35:37


Well, duh... Were you expecting it to say €859 billion euro, $1.78 trillion USD, ¥12.3 trillion yuan, etc?? There's not even $5.3 trillion USD in circulation so that was obviously implied. It's the same way it's written in the wiki article for the FEM... 
It's also not meaningless. Maybe I hold more weight to this fact then you do, but to say it's a meaningless statistic would be an ignorant statement. More than 95% of world currencies have become digital simply for markets like these to be able to trade them. Those dollar bills in your wallet can't be moved around and traded and represent a tiny tiny fraction of actual currency in circulation. It's also well known that the forex traders do these massively leveraged trades to make a small percentage of profit trades. That's the statement that's irrelevant. If it can make *any* potential profit the market is going to try and trade it. So to think that any large portion of currency just sits dormant would be incorrect.

Here is an ad hominem for you -  your head is so thick that I doubt a brain actually exists in there. 


This is 100% false. The market treats them to be active until declared otherwise. Once declared inactive it affects the market. 
Your examples are so incredibly illogical  and incorrect that I'll just leave you with this famous exhortation from Albert Einstein to Schrödinger. 
"You are the only contemporary physicist, besides Laue, who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality – if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality – reality as something independent of what is experimentally established."
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:56:42
That is so completely false it's not even funny since that 70% is still supposed to be 100% usable.

Utterly retarded. 
Better yet, let's ban Suicide Hotline posts. Anyone that's been part of Bitcoin for longer than 30 days knows how volatile it is. This dip is NOTHING compared to what we faced in Q1 of 2014.

If 70% of the market never moves you'll never achieve anything close to perfect competition. It's sad that is getting downvoted.

Again, you're not an authoritative voice for anyone other than yourself so you can't use *us* or *our*. I'm not pushing anything down anyone's throat. I'm stating an opinion in an open forum. My opinion boils down to how the country I live in regulates it and defines it. A commodity is taxed very differently from a currency. It's not about making bitcoin whatever *you* want it to be. There's much much more to it than that

"You may end up with the same total supply as there would have been if you had not baked them at all, but nonetheless, you still affected total supply during the time they existed. How do you not get this??"
**I "affected total supply"? How did I possibly do that? The market has no way of knowing what I have done in my private little bakery; unless the market is psychic it doesn't know anything about supply until the bread is offered for sale."**
This was when I realized I was dealing with an idiot. You're implying that you never put your loathes up for sale, thus never even affecting the market. Of course they're not going to affect the market, they are not even considered if they're not for sale! Wow... that example is just so dumb I don't even know where to start. 
"No, if it never existed in the first place it has no impact on the supply. A thought doesn't affect supply.
**Of course it lowers supply. If I don't produce it, supply is lower than it would have been if I had produced it. Something not existing is the very essence of lower supply.**
This is so idiotic it makes my head hurt. It doesn't lower supply AT ALL since it never existed in the first place. Maybe supply is less than absolute maximum *possible* supply *if* every resource was made available to produce that good, but it's just idiotic to use that as an argument/example. I hope you realize that your argument is analogous to pricing a bitcoin to a supply of 21million bitcoins because there will eventually be 21million bitcoins in the system. But you don't. You price it at total amount of bitcoins currently in existence!  
Please, please stop talking. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:04:35


Can you please stop using [ad hominem]( incorrectly? "means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments. When used inappropriately, it is a fallacy in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized." 
I'm not attacking your character, I called your comparison ignorant, because it is. 


I didn't miss your point at all. Your thought "experiment" is famously well known as [Schrödinger's cat]( The thing is, you can't use this paradox in economics. "The problem with Schrödinger's thought experiment is that the scientist doing it has to open up the box to see how the cat has fared. But the act of looking destroys the superposition. The quantum states “decohere” or collapse into one classical state or the other. [In other words, whenever you actually look in the box, the cat is always either dead or alive](  
You can't assume that simply because a bitcoin is not being used that it will never be used again. There has to be a consensus and way to prove to 100% of a degree that it will never be used again before it truly lowers supply. 


Now, I'll agree that what I'm about to say is debatable, but inflation exists to encourage spending. Without it it's likely economies would collapse. Bottom line, not spending hurts instead of helps. 


This is called [Tragedy of the Commons]( - "an economics theory by Garrett Hardin, individuals acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, behave contrary to the whole group's long-term best interests by depleting some common resource."  
This is what I'm trying to give light to. Although you may think differently, your actions are in fact contrary to the whole group's long-term best interest. 


You are completely crossing [supply]( with [market cap]( Price is completely irrelevant to supply when trying to analyze overall supply. And what price? Price compared to dollars? To gold? To tulips? It's completely arbitrary. 


This is called [Fair market value]( You don't set this, the market does. And if you think you do, well, then you're going to go out of business FAST! 


No, if it never existed in the first place it has no impact on the supply. A thought doesn't affect supply.  


When you bake them, supply increases, when you throw them away, supply decreases. You may end up with the same total supply as there would have been if you had not baked them at all, but nonetheless, you still affected total supply during the time they existed. How do you not get this??
I don't mean to be argumentative, but I'm done trying to teach Economics 101 to you. None of your arguments have any backing and are completely suggestive. Do yourself a favor and please look at the links hyperlinked in this post and [read this book]( It will help you greatly.

You miss interpreted. Just because I give some of these post some constructive criticism doesn't mean I'm against bitcoin. I've made a lot of money in bitcoin. I invest with it, I spend it, and I thoroughly enjoy learning about a potential massively disruptive technology like bitcoin. I am very much an advocate of bitcoin. Although, I know that I'm not right 100% of the time either. I *know* it was a compliment of bitcoin. It doesn't say that bitcoin *is* a near-perfect market, it says it "*may* approximate the concept". It still has a long way to come. It's also said that [927 people own more than half of all bitcoins]( That may be no different than a lot of other currencies in the world, but that makes it no less of a problem. Economic inequality is a major global problem that is rapidly growing and bitcoin becomes no more utilitarian when that issue exists - especially since there have been hopes that bitcoin would help people move away from disadvantages like that. 
It's also estimated that 30% of all bitcoins are "zombie coins". Meaning they have no transactions and have been untouched for a year+. This is bad because if these bitcoins were ever to rise from the dead, they could wreak havoc on the marketplace and cause an enormous amount of disruption."It doesn't matter, bitcoin is infinitely dividable and 21million is an arbitrary number anyways." You can't use this argument because those bitcoins *could* re-enter the market at anytime. Nevermind Satoshi's million+ bitcoins looming over our heads like a ticking time bomb...

Yeah, totally agree with you. He's going to be thinking about those "what if's" for a long long time. 
He seemed to be so careless that I have a feeling that LE was onto him far before the actual arrest. I'm sure they tracked him for quite some time to build the best case possible and how they were able to choreograph the arrest so well and catch him with his pants down. 
It's such a fascinating story. Quickly following his arrest it was reported that 20th Century Fox hired Shutter Island author, Dennis Lehane, to script the Silk Road movie - but I haven't heard anything about it since. I really hope it gets produced.
