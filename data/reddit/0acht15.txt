Looking at the frontpage, you guys are really really desperately going into "denial and deflection" mode..

At some point the company decided: "We don't earn any money by distributing a free client without ads, no matter how popular we are. Lets try to squeeze some money out of our customer base, even if we lose most of them its still a better return of investment".

Actually, its in the documents.
The got hold of the phyical hoster of the website and had it running as a honeypot since summer, until they could find out his identity. They have copies of over 1 million messages and transactions that were done during the time they had the server hijacked.

If it would, than it would basically make bitcoin worthless as a currency.
I mean, basically DOS for currency at no cost to the attacker?

 Wow. Thats a new one. Things are really moving with the speed of light the last couple hours...
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:01:26
Ah, crap. That makes it lame.

Because it makes people less likely to buy ASICs. And people pay for them in bitcoins. This is a million $ market and a significant fraction of the bitcoin economy. 
You might get frontpage posts about stores selling bacon or whatever for BTC, but that is utterly insignificant compared to lets say KnC shipping 1000 boxes.

I found some other news. I think lots of people are really fucked. They had the hoster of the server subpoenaed since july or something had have a complete record of all PMs and transactions of the last couple months (more than a million individual ones).
Adding to this "the other side" from the blockchain...

You should see the guys on Choice quotes are "he did it to defend the lives of thousands of his users" or "Am I the only one on DPSs site about the hits? The other guy fired the first shot"

Look at it from this perspective:
You have bitcoins - they don't. 
You advertise them. 
If they ever get wide acceptance, their value would need to rise orders of magnitude. Hell, it might already have benefited you, if you mined them back when difficulty was 1 or they cost a couple cent. In constrast to them, who would need to pay $100+ for one.
So, to an outside perspective, you push a pyramid scheme in order to personally profit form the fact that you bought in early at a very low price.
And thats obnoxious.

It is no secret that at least a part of TOR is run as honeypots, including exit nodes. There have been conference talks about this even by "private researchers" who studied the exit node traffic. 
I am not completely familiar with how TOR works with .onion sites, but they might just have had luck - maybe they could access the site and every single hop to the target was per coincidence a TOR node they owned themselves? 
I mean, it TOOK them long enough to find it, after all...

No, 600k BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:04:46
Why? He is sitting on at least a couple 100k bitcoins (with up to 2.5 million not unlikely) he mined before it took of. 
The new Rothshild needs some spotlight on whatever he does lurking in the shadows.
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:43:49
You realize that Satoshi seems to own 5-10% of all bitcoins - setting him up as the new Rothshild if it ever gets universal? At least for a government you can vote....

Thats less than the network grows within 36h.
So, negligible. Even if they were completly gone, tomorrow the gap would be closed.
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:47:46
Lol. They didn't even add "Bitcoin" to their word dictionary. Nor did they remove the spell correction squiggles in their cover screenshot.
Edit: Hah, they fixed it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:27:46
Just wondering... if they seized 26k bitcoins, they got at least some of his data.
Just how much of a connection tree can be reconstructed from the blockchain?
