Thats called a buy order. Meaning you can say "I want to buy 2 Bitcoins if the price reaches for example 500 USD."
If the price then should ever reach the specified price, the order will trigger and the transfer will take place.
Its so that you don't have to sit in front of the exchange waiting for the price to reach your desired price. But of course nobody guarantees that your buy price will ever be reached.
Same with stop orders. To prevent extreme losses you can place a stop order to sell your Bitcoins if the price falls beneath a specified price.
Hope that helps.

The constant shitposting on both subreddits as well as spamming users with either opinion has to stop imo.
Even if you present valid arguments they will be perceived as spam if you randomly pm users. 
I'm not sure if the sender realizes that he's doing more damage than good for this 'cause'.

not downvoting you. 
however not only the auto-moderator won't moderate your post, for humans its also very hard to easily read it.

1.) Depending on wether you want to hold it for a long time or gamble short term. If you want to hodl, it doesn't really matter. I would recommend splitting your total investment amount and purchase every few weeks to hedge your investment a little bit and be less affected by volatility. Or: Wait till after the etf. If it gets denied and panic sells happen - buy.
2.) Have you tried to do it? It's pretty self explanatory. Don't be afraid.
3.) Yes. Simply use your wallet adress. You can find it under "receive money". However for larger amounts I would recommend hardware wallets such as the ledger wallets.

This doesn't solve the current 'war' going on between the subreddits. I don't care about one pm. But I can't imagine that the current way the core vs. BU issue is being discussed is very productive.

how to make sure nobody actually reads your post. simply invert it.
