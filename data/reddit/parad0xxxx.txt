No need to kick yourself this comment is said in almost all threads or announcements that bitcoin reached a new high or a milestone. Almost absolutely no one would be a bitcoin millionairr even if you would have bought at 1ct per bitcoin you woulf have sold way earlier in retrospect everyone could have been a lotto bitcoin or stock millionaire if you are able to see into the future.

Not cashing out soon will be a big mistake. 
Also not sure why you are going to post this. 
This post will not even reach a tiny fraction of a tiny fraction of a tiny faction of a fraction of Bitcoinuser.Not many people have become bitcoin millionaires a few thousands at best. But maybe a few hundreds only considering the majority of people cash out at a small gain or relatively small gain of 100 or 200%.
 You are pulling the amazon statement out of thin air. Bitcoin is a currency and not meant to be used as a retirement investment. Comparing Bitcoin with the stockmarket is so crazy  I don't even know where to  begin. It's like going to a Casino and gambling your retirement away. 
If you are not cashing out what's the point ? 
If you spend the BTC and it "shoots up to the moon" then you will be angry that you spent that much money.

If you are not a billionaire which is highly unlikely it's very dumb to put this much money into Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency in general. I can't believe someone with this amount of money has no idea about investing. 
This post also might be Bitcoin Propaganda and convincing user to buy Bitcoin instead of Altcoin.
Either 1 in a million stupidity or fake as fuck.
I personally think it's fake.

How is it costing investors billions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:09:45
It is exactly that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:33:23
What's the point of doing this?

10 percent gains over a long period of time is really good. The difference between you and these people is that they actually have a lot of money at stake now I'm just assuming here but they were probably way older than you which means they are close to retirement. Even if you aren't close to retirement you shouldn't put the majority of your wealth into Bitcoin because it is way to volatile.
The 300 percent gain came with high risk and luck which you want to avoid to a certain extent when investing for retirement.

This perfectly displays the absurd price of BTC right now.

This post seems like a desperate attempt to influence a tiny minority of a tiny minority of a tiny minority of a tiny minority of people interested in Cryptos to not sell their Crypto/ to buy Crypto again. 
My friend invested 200k sounds like you pulled it out of your ass.
I doubt there is anyone with that kind of money that is stupid enough to announce or tell others about it.
You say Bitcoin has the potential to become as big as Gold. Well you know what? Everything that's not impossible has the potential to happen.
If the stock market is as you say why not bet against it ? 
Who says Bitcoin will benefit from a stock market crash?
If you break it down crypto "currency" is very similiar to the stockmarket.
You are putting money into it expecting a ROI.
Just the hype made so many people buy it. For so many people it's not about the technology or what's possible it's just about making money short or long term which is a huge issue. 
It's not used as it was intended to be , a currency.
Do the magic and use your logic is the funniest part.
You can't predict Bitcoin and it's price by using logic.
If the price/demand of Bitcoin is declining it's limited supply is irrelevant. 
The price won't increase just because the supply is becoming less.
You just think Switzerland or a bank in Switzerland is buying Bitcoin. So what ? 
Many banks are doing shady shit and some go bankrupt this doesn't mean it was a smart move.
Also on my final note comparing Cryptocurrencies to the stock market is ridiculous. The stock market has a track record of ups and down but if you would have invested at any time even before a crash happened on average you would have made a profit long term.
For how long have cryptocurrencies existed ?
