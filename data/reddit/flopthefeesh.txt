You could do that too, that would be cool!
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:53:27
Shirley he cant be
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:30:27
That's what I tried to say to the judge
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:33:22
It's a 2013 Mercedes C Class
@_date: 2013-06-06 04:45:45

@_date: 2013-06-01 20:12:29
I think you might as well pay the Bitcoin swear jar for posting that image

I suggested that we try to get VLC player to accept Bitcoin as a donation and from what I can tell, it turned out to be successful.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:24:01
You are awesome :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:43:02
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:13:06
That's a good one too!
....Except I really like expensive cars
@_date: 2013-06-06 04:07:08
Damn that M3 is a nice looking car. The SL, on the other hand, idk. That's not my shindig.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:48:47
Soo unfortunate
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:08:48
should i listen to an ANAL_SAND_TAX?
@_date: 2013-10-25 05:59:24
Whoa whoa whoa there, 
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:09:39
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:02:24
Don't worry about it, dude. Thanks for the help :)
@_date: 2013-06-10 21:26:26
How much are their transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-06-02 05:10:03
No. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:38:53
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:55:28
I don't think it works that way... :P
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:37:02
I thought nobody used it until I saw it on thepiratebay today. I thought "oh, maybe i should give litecoin a closer look now!"
Nope, its still the same.
@_date: 2013-06-02 01:04:27
Well that's nothing *I* can tell. My bets on the 350
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:08:05
I started with $30 and got 1.2 BTC 
I'm 17 and a high school student; but I'm disappointed I lost over a months paycheck worth of USD in a day
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:09:51
hence the need for donations
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:13:29
10 days
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:56:32
If he's a Bitcoin billionaire, he would theoretically own a third of the entire market value, wouldn't he? *damn*
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:55:41
I feel your pain :(
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:20:00
That's a perma-ban
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:34:30
You just wanted free money 
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:39:21
Looks like he doesn't want your D
@_date: 2013-06-03 05:01:28
There are so many items on that site at stupidly high prices. $250 for a 32GB microSD card? Really?
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:10:13
really? How long ago did you ask them?
EDIT: the reason i ask is because I think they can change their mind due to the increase in popularity with Bitcoin
