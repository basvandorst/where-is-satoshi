how is it "backed" by a meme l0l people don't join dogecoin purely because its associated with the doge meme... If bitcoin was to start donating to charities and spreading to others (instead of the limited number of holders who are now hoarding - many developing a superiority complex) it'd become a lot more popular...

And who are they worshiping?

what fustrations lmao? you're the one who's hating on dogecoin. I think there's nothing wrong with bitcoin except that it won't get any more popular than it is. There might be relatively a higher demand but only because there's a lower supply l0l
edit; btw nice strongman argument l0l0l0l0

Yeap and from the responses it's sadly going to be seen as the angry grandfather who just yells random shit at the new kids cause they're young n shit!

it may be a good problem! Except when you dealer gets sick of getting 0.00000000013163 ;)

No new features? We'll it's not dominated by ASICs for one. Can you round up a bunch of friends who aren't into cryptocurrencies and convince them to start mining for BTC right now?? Good job proving OP's point though, funny how just because it doesn't appeal to YOU, it has to have a "retarded" looking dog haha!

I can't wait for bitcoin holders to hoard for 15 years, then realise how stupid it is that they give some 0.00000000135361361 of a bitcoin for a gram of weed.

Lmao! and this is post epitomizes why people stopped joining bitcoin. Because people think they're gods talkdown to people about things they haven't researched nor tried. LOL OP should just copy and paste your post in the OP to show bitcoin it's losing popularity.
FYI DC has barely anything to do with the meme, The whole point of dogecoin is to share it, love it and take care of others. You on the other hand, are most likely HOARDING and would never give out any of your bitcoin to another person in Go to and look in any thread and people are tipping left right and centre. Take the loss "kid" you're the problem with Bitcoin.

So you can't imagine anyone would trade bitcoin for USD? LOL

For one thing, why would newbies join bitcoin and mine for a week to earn 0.00013742 of a bitcoin when they can have the equivalent in 5000 or 10000 dogecoins! think about it, people are impatient in this day and age! Add to the fact that dogecoin is spreading to imgur, other subreddits(tipping capabilities) and even facebook! The other thing is that people can already use it for dominoes vouchers, amazon vouchers etc.

Well think of it this way Bitcoin will be much rarer although hold higher value... not everyone is gonna be bothered to invest or mine 0.0264 bitcoin. On the other hand, Doge is designed to be much more accessible to the average Joe. In 5-10 years DC might not even reach $1usd/1 Dogecoin but at least anyone wanting to in on currencies will be able to buy in with $50 and tip friends or random people a doge coin on facebook,reddit and imgur. Would receiving 0.04572 of a currency grab your attention or would receiving 5-10 coins of a currency get you more interested?

Yes you do seem to be jealous that bitcoin is falling in popularity :( You seem to be irritated that i hit the nail on the head that you'd never as to even think about sharing a part of your bitcoin haha then again you probably lack the friends to do so !
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:30:56
Wait, people are typing things that you don't like on the internet??? HOW OUTRAGEOUS!
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:32:17
What's forcing you to talk/read them? Just downvote and move on. Seems like things are getting to you... kind of sad really seeing as you're an *adult* (from the way you implied speaking with a child is a terrible thing to do!)
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:05:40
Yeah but unfortunately you can't give nor received satoshis off of WoS but i understand your point of view. Maybe satoshi can work on this in future but then it'll just become a meta currency l0l
