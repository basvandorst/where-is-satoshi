I didn't know that Groupon was available on Gyft. That's pretty cool, actually.
To be clear though, I don't think it would help bitcoin other than inflating the transaction volume by my order cost*2 (transaction to BitPay, and then BitPay's liquidation).

At the time that I typed that up, if someone purchased 96,110$ USD worth of BTC the price would have risen at the then-503.69$ USD to 506$ USD; however, by spending 100,000$ USD the whole market cap of BTC raises by 31$ million.
Imagine if you happen to have 1% of that 31$ million, you would have increased the value of what you hold by 310,000$ USD. Factor in the fact you bought 190 BTC (96,110$ USD) and you made a net gain of 210,219$ USD.
1% of that would be 130,000 BTC, and the Winklevii have a known stash of 120,000 BTC. If big name players, alleged by rumor, are indeed buying while they're cheap then the 50m$ USD to buy 100,000 BTC gradually is monopoly money and they can stand greatly from manipulating the market.
Then there are whales who happened to get in and be lucky. At the time 100,000 BTC was a few hundred, and now it's a few million. They can stand to sell a huge bit and drive the price down, then buy again slowly while the price is down for a cool 1m$.
The big point is that they wouldn't spend 1m$ to move the market 1m$. You spend a quarter million and you move the market cap by 100m$ almost.

Again, block sequence was never an issue. It was me explaining that the difference in the time stamp is due to the variation in time of the computer. 
You're telling me the same thing that I told you, and it wouldn't make sense any other way. You're taking what I say in the teeth of the actual point: time stamps.
If block 300000's time stamp is before block 299999's time stamp, by the laws of physics (in the most literal sense, comparing time) block 300000 was found before 299999; however, block 300000 is clearly not before 299999.
The point was me demonstrating that while some blocks may have a 1 hour gap, some may have a negative time gap as well. Please don't make this overly complicated.

I'm always hesitant to buy more bitcoin than the 200$ in bitcoin I buy on Fridays. I noticed a trend seems to be for the price to hover around one value for a few days after stabilizing, shooting up, dropping about 30% of the amount gained, and restabilizing. At least that's what noticed in the past two rises to 450 and 530

The problem that you appear to have is that you believe in bitcoin as an investment, rather than valuing it for its features, advancements, and financial improvements. Bitcoin shouldn't be led through adoption by the investment opportunity, but by how it can improve your life and help you take control of your money. Of course with more awareness and adoption, we will see a natural rise in Bitcoin's market cap.

@_date: 2014-12-27 18:41:13
We saw a 'correction' because the price of BTC was artificially inflated to 1200$. So instead of seeing a steady rise to 300$, we saw a sharp decline to 300$.

You think that top level venture capitalist investors would invest in BitPay if it was unprofotable -- let alone give BitPay $30 million? Let's be real here.
Also did Tony not say that BitPay is already profitable but the $30 million is for expansion and growth? Why would they raise so much for expansion and growth only to lose investor mo-- like do you even know what you're saying?
BitPay is not a new com-- like you really don't know what you're saying. Founded in late 2011 and its early 2014 for a total of 2.5 years. That is a new company... and it will continue to profit regardless of BTC price. If people will pay with bitcoin, BitPay will continue to profit.

Answer me this: The DEA has visited SoCoMJ and nothing happened. SoCoMJ says that they take their security seriously, but they're blatantly shipping to states that aren't even a medically legal state. Why would the DEA allow this? Honeypot maybe?
SWIM would rather go to "shady" TOR sites (which really aren't that shady at all) and purchase from someone who actually has a superb rating, that hasn't been visited by the DEA, and has a competant understanding of anonymity.
If you want to buy drugs, so be it. But ordering from a ClearNet site to a state that doesn't support MJ in the legal sense is just stupid. They process BTC themselves, might as well just take the extra step and get on a TOR site. In reality would you rather order something illegally off some TOR marketplace or off the clear net?

You're an idiot. I wouldn't invest in BTC either. I buy it because I believe in the benefits it gives us. I value it as a currency, not an investment. Idiots like you who are "investing" in bitcoin are losing their money because they want fast money now. Two years ago bitcoin was less than 10$ and now its 400$ so it's still going pretty strong. But I guess people like you who don't see the price at 1,000$ are crying because bitcoin is dead.
Look at the most recent price drop from 400 to 355. A LOT of people hopped on that and now its back to 425$. People were MAD they didnt get in on that. And the fact that you think Gox will save bitcoin is hi lar IOUS. Gox used to be a thing. It's not anymore. Much like those silly bands used to be a thing Gox will pass for REAL exchanges (which we still have yet to see).
In America according to bank of america there are 1 million or so bitcoin users. Imagine if adoption spread faster, what will the price do? Go up. 
Additionally since we are talking about investing (or at least you are), don't invest what you cannot afford to lose. Go invest in a mutual fund or something.

I have a ledger that I use to write all the BTC I aqcuire and the prices. When I spend, I use the cheapest one I purchased first. Granted with IRS calling it property, we can't claim a loss so using the cheapest one you purchased first may be bad. Could be best to use the one closest to the current exchange rate. (I get paid in BTC so I have a lot of varied exchange rates; additionally if anyone is wondering it evens out because I get paid at highs and lows so they just meet in the middle)
Using your example:
Buy 1 for 200, buy 1 for 250
Sell 1 for 300 (100$ profit) sell 0.5 for 300 (25$ profit)

Come to think of it that's not a bad strategy for me to do to make some quick BTC instead of playing a game...

I feel like it could be feasible if people gave circle their bank account info and they had to verify it and it was an instant process, it's just receiving those two sub 1$ transactions takes long as fuck.
Wouldn't it be interesting if exchanges made gift cards for like C(circle)USD on circle.com for the use of exchanging directly to bitcoin at any time they like?

My guess is that you would plug that into a monitor, and the power source from the monitor would also power the computer. Maybe it's USB and the second hole on its right side is a MicroHDMI port, I can't tell. The latter would be the best.

I don't think he could have been satoshi. Satoshi came off as a very educated, very proper person and Karpeles does not strike me this way. Additionally, I would believe that if Karpeles company was going in the shitter, that 'Satoshi' would 'magically' be moving weight as well.

I like how the owner has contacted BitPay and you feel it necessary to post an issue that's currently between them on Reddit. Maybe you should ask the owner about the progress rather than post on social media. Were you expecting an answer from BitPay on reddit? isn't a user, so not sure who you're tagging here. Does the owner know you posted? Because you flat out namedropped on their business, and they may not like that.

I work for bitcoin CEO on Bitcoinia and I agree with this sentiment.
Bitcoin isn't an investment. It's a protocol and a currency, but not an investment. If you invest in euro, you invest in a euro ETF not the euro. 
Bitcoin ETF belongs in a portfolio, but not actual bitcoin.

He's not referring to the end goal of 1.0 or 1.375 million, he's referring to the fact that when its around ~1m, you won't care for the 75$ extra you had to spend to get that bitcoin, because its worth much more
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:40:52
Its not a mantra for bitcoin, its a mantra for investing and it will never lose steam because its valid in every investing circumstance. If you invest more than you can afford to lose, then you can either gain a lot or lose a lot.
For example if you sold your car to buy bitcoin back at 1,000$ then you'll be sorry because you can have 4x less now. If you invested 100$ and it went to 25$, you'd be much less sorry.

I think he means he wants BTC devs to collect their paycheck in BTC. While I don't disagree fully, you can't pay bills with BTC yet. Until one can live entirely on BTC by paying for everything in BTC, people won't accept it for their paycheck

You know, there is a lot of merit to what you say. Stocks split when the entry fee is too high, so changing the default denomination will allow people to buy "bits to the dollar" rather than "dollars to the bitcoin," which is more appealing. I would still prefer mBTC before bits, but it's a step in the right direction.

Seems like it would be expensive to run a 170$ node when people have provably made them for 50-70$ (and sometimes less). That and the storage space for the 170$ EC is 32 GB, which is p-nuts, so you'd have to opt for the 500 GB one for 229$ unless you want to spend 40$ on an external hard drive, which would save you 30$ if you go this route.

This is a bitcoin education problem. We need people to understand the following:
1 BTC = 1 BTC
1 USD = 1 USD
At this time of writing 1 USD = 0.00364963 BTC. But this won't be the same 15 minutes from now. Even expanding on this point, the exchange rate that BitPay uses is different from the one that Coinbase uses is different from the one that Circle uses.
Back to our example, 0.00364963 BTC = 0.00364963 BTC. But for BitPay 0.00364963 BTC can be 0.98 USD, for Coinbase can be 0.99 USD, and for Circle can be 1.00 USD.
People who fund their first wallet today and wants to buy today do *not* get a shallow deal. Much to the contrary my friend. People who fund their first wallet today and *actually researched bitcoin* even a little bit do not get a shallow deal.
I remember when PayPal came out, someone tried to pay me 10 USD and it came through as 9.41 USD. Keeping that in mind, if someone pays for my products in BTC the difference in exchange rate will be less than a 25¢ difference. If the customer underpays, I can reach out to BitPay and someone from there support team adjusts the invoice for me within the hour.

I think one company just won an 860k slot, so its possible but the next winner won an xx$ million slot so I don't think this guy would be able to reliably get 1.5$m in BTC exactly.
Honestly, getting 1.5$m in bitcoin (5400BTC) all at once from one buyer may be hard because most who have that many are holding.

This. I never complain about selling at a loss (or more specifically, using BTC at a lower price than I purchased them for) because if I don't like what I spent I just purchase the BTC back at market value.

So the general idea is over the long term bitcoin is predicted to continue on an upward trend. There may be some ups and downs, but the general trend over a long period term (think five to ten years, maybe even as low as two) the price of bitcoin will go up. This is why people are investing 200$ now for their kids college fund hoping the price of bitcoin goes up to (at the current supply of BTC, what the winklevii say) 75,000$, which would essentially allow them to have around 60-65,000$ saved up for their kids college fund. Many words?
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:34:41
Lol. Leave it to investopedia to get the history wrong. 2013 is when it started being volatile? What about the time it dropped 97% from June 2011 to October 2011? That was pretty volatile. As a side note: We recovered (to today's exchange rate) 8800%. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:50:55
You don't need 97bn to increase the network worth by 97bn. If you put in 1bn then I am pretty sure the price would reach very high heights, because not all coins are for sale at the same time. Look at bitcoin wisdom "5000 BTC to changed the price +3.2%". 5000 BTC is about 1.25m but 3.2% is a change of 112m
