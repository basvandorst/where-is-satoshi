Are you by any chance a Nigerian Prince?

Boycotted PayPal for 13 years after they stole near 1k from me (over 3 incidents). For some reason I went back and in less than a year of using their service I'm fighting them again to not have to pay for a scammer that was supposed to send a lead acid battery (150lbs/75Kg) but instead sent a 1oz/28g package using a mail service that will not ship lead acid batteries. He admits to everything in chat logs. I tell PayPal:
1) This shipping company won't even ship the item I bought
2) The item was no where near correct weight
3) He openly admits to sending an illegible "manifest" for a different shipping company that has 0 tracking (even though he said they do) and they really aren't a shipping company as much as shipping managers. They're called angolo shipping.
4) The package is supposed to arrive in 30 days or your money is returned, after over 3 months he tells me the package is stuck because he didn't pay some fee
The first reason I stopped using PayPal was because they sided with a person who bought a highly modded Xbox 360 from me for between $400-$500 and said I shipped them an empty box. PayPal said we always side with the buyer because we feel sellers can take the hit easier.
Then this exact thing happens to me and their policy instantly changes. 
They won't check with Royal mail and see they refuse to send a lead acid battery to the United States from the United Kingdom.
They won't check the weight and see it is a factor of 2678 times smaller.
They won't check angolo shipping to see there is no way to track the shipment, which is against their policy as well.
 They won't honor the 30 days to arrive or your money back. 
They won't look at the chat log. 
They are enabling scamming and punishing victims. 
It makes me want to rage quit life.
I would love to see this thread get huge I was planning on maybe making a video I really don't know I'm desperate... not to get my money back, or to expose the scammer who f'd me, but to make PayPal accountable for being a completely incompetent company that needs to be shut down immediately.

If I need advice on what soymilk pairs best with a vegan burger I'll consult vox but I wouldn't trust anything they have to say about crypto.

Cryptopia, MtGox, Binance, Nicehash just the few I can think of off the top of my head.

Why aren't the overzealous mods removing this because it shows alts and shouldn't be in BTC (according to them).
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:31:13
You aren't allowed to mention alts at all otherwise the mods delete the thread in my own experience when I posted a binance photo with BTC and alts it was flagged for not being in r/altcoins this damn subreddit is worse than Nazi Germany

Yeah that's probably going back in that direction too after those 7000 BTC got stolen

I just use a flashlight to communicate. 1 blink for 0 two blinks for 1. It's half a bit per second but it's moving at the speed of light.
