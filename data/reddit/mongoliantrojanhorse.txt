I don't think so. SegWit adoption hasn't changed much recently:

GDAX is the same isn't it? 0% maker fees, 0.25% taker fees and pays for transfer fees.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:45:07
Yeah their fee structure is nice: 
Not 100% sure about them covering transaction fees on transfers though. Thats just what I've heard.

It's the monospaced font they used. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:44:55
I sure hope so. I want to buy more.

You should also have way more than 10k saved for retirement by the time you're 40. I hope OP is joking.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:03:44
They really need to change that monospaced font.

What's wrong with Coinbase? I've been using it for years without any problems.

Check out the second definition of literally:

Nah, $700ish is the return to average. Might even be able to get some in the $600 range.

Yes, that's true. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if vendors like steam offered even a small discount for Bitcoin purchases.
But in this example of a $2.50 transaction, the ~$0.25 fee is 10% of the original cost.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:18:04
While I agree with you, Bitcoin isn't only about large transactions. Buying a steam game that costs $2.50 isn't worth it with Bitcoin because of the fees.

What is the benefit is using a hardware wallet over an encrypted wallet like Electrum? Just convince? Or is there also additional security?
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:38:03
Buy the dip!

You liked the B with a buttplug over the one they picked?

Binance opened a US specific version last month:

I'm not saying you're wrong. You're definitely right that these fees are hidden and we pay then regardless.
But when a merchant doesn't offer any incentive to pay with Bitcoin then it's cheaper to pay with a credit card.
Your choice is to pay $X with your credit card (and get some Cashback or points) or pay $X + $transactionFee with Bitcoin. 
You pay those hidden fees regardless of your method of payment with most of the merchants I've used Bitcoin with.
My point is that there needs to be incentive to use Bitcoin. Whether it's for privacy or for a discount on the transaction like many gas stations do for paying with cash.

No, because anyone who invests based on the predictions of an anonymous poster with an anime pic doesn't have enough money to impact the market.

Yup, the OP is the Coinbase Pro fees:

How much bandwidth does a full node use? Comcast is rolling out bandwidth caps my area. 1TB per month.
@_date: 2016-10-08 00:31:56
They also charge $10 per 50GB over 1TB.
But hey, for just $50 extra per month you can get unlimited data!
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:44:58
But will they accept?
