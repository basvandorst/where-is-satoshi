Correct me if im wrong, but isnt that coinkite that your talking about?
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:11:37
Im not sure it does, only created this wallet today
Now this has happened!
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:46:31
Oh thats a relief, although i cannot find anywhere to bypass the warning

@_date: 2015-10-10 23:01:09
Thanks! all sorted now,was a bit hesitant at first with the whole letting somone else know my privkey but its all done now
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:24:28
That was what i was thinking, was kinda hopeing there was some other cool/useful other purpose

Well I was more thinking about how to make small scale mining worthwhile, as a miner from back in the days of home GPU mining I loved the idea about being part of the bigger thing whereas now mining is only done by the mildly wealthy with ASIC's. Mining was my only source of getting BTC (With the exception of faucets) due to being on a low income and over my time ive probably acquired about £30 worth of BTC. Now back to your question, basically attempting to help the little man before i had the realization that the more high end rigs will be eating up the transaction fees
Tl;dr: Trying to help people out who cant afford to straight out buy BTC

Ah i think you may have fallen into the same pitfall as i did, i did the exact same thing as you did but failed to notice the minimum payout value, you may want to run it for a day or two, take note of how much you made, then see how long before you will get a pay out. I was an early adopter of home BTC mining on my GT635m and it would take months for one payout so after a week i decided it wasnt worth it for a monetary point of view. however if you were wanting to help out the network and dont mind making a loss by all means go ahead!

Thanks for such a quick reply! This was more of a hypothetical question meaning while one person doing such an action would be a drop in the ocean but say a large group of participants joined in to do such an action would that be noticeable? And what if they were using a client such as electrum?
This was more of a thought exercise stemming from the idea to help the community through making mining more profitable without just plain donating to one pool, spread the wealth as it seems.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:30:58
Thats what i was doing, changing from bitcoin-qt to electrum, except i cant find how to import private keys
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:18:29
I guess i liked the idea of of turning the resources towards a common goal temporarily to solve a problem previously impossibly by a single machine.
I think was meaning the actual hashing itself seems a bit wasteful, we all see the need for it, but say you were just hashing and rehashing every file on a hard drive for days on end that would be wasteful.

It is possible for you to make money that way, but ive heard about some of the more strict banks holding money when withdrawing large amounts of money from BTC so you may want to withdraw in multiple small amounts. Well thats my understanding at least, if anyone else has anything to amend/add to this please dont hesitate to comment

Mining on a Mac...
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:55:09
Ah that is a fair point. While donating to charity is a good idea, the main objective of my inquiry is to help promote the bitcoin network, so how would one go about that?
Also i really like the idea of the reddit tipping thing, how would i go about setting that up?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:13:00
I tried that and for some reason the transaction failed, i then imported the private keys into blockchain.info and sent from there, surprise surprise it failed again.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:16:37
You guys are going to have to tell me if that tip worked, complete newbie here
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:48:34
I have to say, ive only just started with ive found the whole experience rather confusing and i think to try to introduce more people to the tipping ecosystem on reddit there should be a dumbed down guide for the non bitcoin veterans
@_date: 2013-01-01 16:06:16
Oh, thanks for pointing that out
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:13:39
yea, a lot of small transfers from faucets and low yield mining etc
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:13:24
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:07:55
Yeah, thats exactly what happened, which is a bit of a shame
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:59:51
Ok i will do! I think this help is in order of a tip, now if only i wasnt a broke sixth form student i may be able to give you a bit more, sorry about that
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:47:19
Changed servers last night: didnt turn up. left it for a night and changed servers in the morning: nothing except ive got a more recent transaction come though but instead of saying unconfirmed transaction it says nothing (in blockchain.info)

As a general rule of thumb try everything in small quantitys first to get the hang of things, and just be careful with a lot of the claims arount "Cheap BTC" popping up every now and again but with the exception of that ad keeping your computer generally secure i get the feeling bitcoins quite a safe platform for monetary transfers so go nuts!
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:38:20
Ah, thanks for clearing that up!
