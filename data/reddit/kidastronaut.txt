I think it's actually a bit more doubtful that this is Russians or that guccifer is a primarily Russian group at all.

You're telling me the bots aren't self-replicating and making their own decisions? That's absurd. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:08:06
This just in, a bot is behaving like a bot. More breaking bitcoin news after the break. What's that? That's it? There's no other news to report other than the daily reddit posts from Neckbeard_Fedora about how great and stable Bitcoin is? Well then, goodnight folks. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:05:25
Have you heard of PayPal? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:27:05
So you posted your question as a random comment in a random thread about bitcoin? That’s barely showing up 
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:31:32
Redditor for 3 months cannot detect sarcasm in a bitcoin sub where merely whispering PayPal will get you banned. 
But seriously, scrub above having trouble sending cash to a different bank is absurd in 2018.

I suppose if you are using the true definition of propaganda. Sorry, most I find around these parts seem to think everyone is out to get them.
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:46:25
I mean not really. Bitcoin has a very long way to go in order to completely replace the cash and cards that an average 35 year old soccer mom with no active interest in technology carries in her purse. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:26:17
HahaHAHAHAHAHAHA. Yes. Producer +1
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:38:29
lmao your logic is frighteningly poor. Go ahead and apply your logic to:
Motor Vehicles (your argument: cars should be illegal because sometimes people crash into other people)
Religion (your argument: religion should be illegal because sometimes people slaughter millions due to a conflict of beliefs)
Guns (it should be obvious by now what your argument should be)
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:49:20
Tobacco. 
Alcohol. 
Homeopathy. 
Predatory lending. 
Seriously pick anything in the world you want and your argument doesn't hold any center. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:22:54
lol every time I return to this sub I think maybe they're a more stable, professional community. Nope, everything still makes bitcoin "skyrocket" 
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:02:48
It's terrifying that you're legitimately afraid to visit that website. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:58:51
I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think your fear is rational. However I think in spite of that fear, we should not let it dissuade our interests and curiosities from being fully explored. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:24:32

However, data is data no matter how it is being processed. T-Mobile should not be identifying tethering usage as somehow different than "normal" data usage. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:49:36
No, not regardless. Completely different making both of your posts here now absolutely pointless. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:39:35
Your reading comprehension is atrocious. How the fuck did you manage to obtain bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:11:16
You can justify your grotesque idea all you want, it's not like it's an original one, obviously. Just know that it's people like you who, these baseless, shortsighted men, who embody the fairytale idea of true evil.

I suppose I don't mind insulting disgusting people. But hey, if your grandest dream is to be a pimp, don't let me stop you.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:49:38
I'm simply giving a philosophical argument why you should not do so, I don't need to layout the reasons why as you understand them based on your original response. 
I don't believe in heaven, or hell. I believe when given the opportunity to do Good or do Bad we should err on the side of Good. We certainly should not invent reasons to do Bad, even when the product of our Bad Work is Great Profit.  
Also, not to use a slippery slope, but it has to be addressed in this day of modern slavery.. If you are weak-willed enough to go through with this idea for profit, will you be weak-willed enough to use trafficked girls? If profit over conscious is your modus operandi, I'd be inclined to think you would. 
No I don't feel above average. Unsure what your assessment of average has to do with anything at all. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:14:15
Lol you think millennials believe in god? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:20:23
Yeah, unfortunately you simply don’t know that. Crypto isn’t a stock or bond and as such isn’t worthless like those are. Crypto may be the only thing anyone wants if that happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:58:04
Yeah, delayed retirement for millennials is just called death. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:45:18
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:47:19
We have different understandings of crypto and where it’s at in its lifespan, what the future looks like in regards to block chain tech and using it as an economic platform. I wouldn’t refer to anything happening to the value of Bitcoin as a crash or a climb or really any of the traditional market adjectives. It’s not even truly born yet, it’s still incubating. It’s volatile, sure, but nobody is going to remember these days, by the time crypto is the only way to pay for anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:02:47
What the fuck is a crypto crash?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:57:26
There is no FDIC for economic collapse either lmao.

@_date: 2018-03-26 20:57:32
You keep changing your actual arguments with each response as I point out each flaw. Done with your dense ass. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:01:53
No, you’re just plain simple wrong. No opinions involved. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:00:15
Oh fuck off with your 15 year old references. Every millennial I know meal preps and cooks at home whenever possible, and $6 Starbucks? Really? We don’t even fuck with Starbucks like that anymore...bad coffee. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:14
There are certainly people who bought bitcoin solely because they think it will increase in price. That is not really the typical investor in this sub. Most of the sub believes that Crypto has an intrinsic value as fiat markets and the power behind them continue to erode. That’s the potential. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:15:57
That’s where you’re wrong. Crypto isn’t a currency first. It has intrinsic value outside of its consideration as currency. Fiat does not. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:40:14
Sounds like you lost out big in the dot com bubble. Poised to do the same here?
You say speculation based on a Company's potential isn't gambling.
You say speculation based on a new technology's potential is gambling.
I say you're definitions are full of shit and don't really make sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:03:25
Ah those young millennials just ain’t hit the struggle yet. Still gettin that campus meal card lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:57:35
Wrong 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:25:24
You mean like speculating on its potential....
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:35:03
No it doesn’t? Why do you think that? It’s not ubiquitous yet as a payment type, but the writing on the wall is pretty clear. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:32:03
...the potential of BTC/Crypto........ why are you even here 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:57:41

I don't buy it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:35:50
Cool, I'd rather not go into that either because my point is about *the intrinsic value of data and how 1mb of Video is not any different than 1mb of text and as an extension, a 5mb photo on the phone vs a 5mb photo through the phone is no different.* my point is not that another company should do it differently, but that we should recognize how any other definition of data is absurd. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:19:23
Has nothing to do with the point I was making at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:30:45

I'm not talking about dumping my entire HSA, but I have the ability to invest my HSA money in stocks and things so I thought Bitcoin might be a possibility as well.
I am not looking for opinions on risk, but your advice is noted.
