Robogate 3.0. When will the fraud end?! Stop treating your customers and the bitcoin community like pieces of shit. Be honest and good to us and build a solid company. Robocoin, what a bunch of fucking retards. Unreal they made it this far.

Can't believe people do business with scamsters like Jordon Kelly. Guy looks like a walking lie. No surprise their product is worthless and every one of their operators feels like their ass was just pounded. Sucks. Too many scams in bitcoin. Sorry to see good folks in community torch $20k-100k+ on fire to get one of these things going only to have it worthless less than a year later.

Robocoin. The company that changes its business model every 6 months. Always looking for a new bagholder after burning the last.

Yikes, Robocoin and Jordon KElly representing bitcoin to newbs to bitcoin is a scary thought. 
Bitcoin ATMs def should be present but we can do much better than Rob-the-coin. Come on Bitpay! BitAccess or Lamasuu

I don't think you are as familiar as you believe. Talk to the RC operators or read a fraction of those reported their stories to [reddit!]( It's outright fraud (taking payment and running away) on top of everything you say. 
It's more than just a couple of operators; it's almost all. And it's not just the operators. Ask bitstamp about RC's payables to them for CES or their kiosk suppliers. Ask their own former employees that have been lied to and led on. The list goes on and on of those who have been shafted by Jordon and RC.

Looks like Jordan Kelley ran with $25k kickstarter funds in one of his earlier cons. Guy needs to be black-listed from bitcoin and business.

Looks like Kickstarter scam was Jordan Kelley's go to before bitcoin
