In fact, in a free market, you shouldn't be forced to provide a service you don't want to.

Brazilian here.
People generally don't know what is bitcoin here, except for techies and other curious people.
Government haven't taken a position yet, officially. I heard they were trying to build a vote system based on ethereum blockchain, but nothing came out yet.
Also some big banks are boycotting exchanges.

For some weird reason, lnd needs to be started with the IP as a command line parameter. If for some reason your local IP changes, lnd won't work correctly until you restart it with the new IP. You can script it, but having a static IP is much better.

Do this:
* Whenever you feel like selling, buy

None knows, yet.

I guess it's too late. But good point
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:55:46
Why should I use it instead of Samourai? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:43:52
Well it seems the plausible deniability wallet is fully funcional, right? So why call it "fake encrypted storage"? Wouldn't be better to call it "alternative" or something else, as you can use it as a daily activities wallet?

Great. I'll give it a shot. Thank you.
