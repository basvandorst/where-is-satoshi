**Sorry people and bots, here in my country we have lots of these places popping up, there is galaxy lifestyle, bitclub and others which is mlm companies, where you must pay monthly and recruit, i did not join them as my friends did and only way to make money is recruiting.  
i found this antmining site when i was looking for miners and though it was legit because it is antmine who does the rigs so did not think it might be a trap, i am sorry and please dont click the link. 
i am really sorry for any inconvenience caused**
