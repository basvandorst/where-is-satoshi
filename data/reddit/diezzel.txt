Futures dont dictate btc price and the volume for futures trades is really low now anyways, short interest is also pretty low. The main reason for the price decline is that retail investors who bought in during the hype have mostly given up and are selling into a market with few buyers, has nothing to do with wallstreet manipulation.

I didnt say anything about risk. Stocks and property have inherent value.  People get rich off many forms of gambling. By your logic, blackjack and lottery tickets are good investments too.

You clearly know nothing about investing or the stock market as well, if you’re looking for high risk high reward plays, you can take on absurd amounts of leverage in stocks or gamble on options trades. Just look at some of the shit people have done in . Theres plenty of riskier plays than buying cryptos. If you think something has value just because you’re risking something for a potential profit, that is the definition of gambling not investing.  Cryptos work really well as a medium of exhange, thats where the value actually comes from. Its intrinsic value comes from people actually using it to buy things.  However, if no one uses their btc because everyone decides to horde it to hopefully drive the price up, thats artificial value like what you see with tsla stock.

Except if the housing market crashes , you still have a place to live. If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders are entitled to a portion of the liquidated assets.
