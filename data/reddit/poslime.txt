The credit system in this country is absolutely absurd. A person who is 30 
years old, never borrowed a single dollar and has been employed for 10 
years has no credit history. So, that person, who should be the most 
reliable person imaginable, can NOT get a loan.﻿

I'm looking forward to seeing this.  I've seen some tv interviews and this 
trailer that has sparked my interest.  The system needs to change.  Why not 
get credit for paying rent or making payments from a debit card?  People 
need to prepare themselves as much as possible to avoid these financial 
pitfalls.  Avoid the temptation for high interests payments at any cost. 
 It is interesting that American Express has produced this movie.  Mmmmm???﻿

Justin can easily apply for a free checking account. I've been using Ally 
Bank for years and I couldn't be more satisfied with them. Discover also 
offers free checking. I recently opened an account with them. Both accounts 
don't require minimum balances. There's no reason to use pre-paid cards and 
pay the fees that go along with them.﻿

This has to be one of your greatest videos Myles! I do believe in some of 
the things that you've said, but I think it's going to take way more effort 
and time than what you're expecting. For example, I don't think the future 
of education is on the Internet, or at least not now, but a more 
individualized education is key, do I'd say we have to change the ways of 
teaching first. Also, as a musician myself, I believe that it's okay that 
people can listen to your stuff free on the Internet but it could actually 
make things harder for us if no one is willing to pay for our music. The 
same goes for actors and filmmakers. On a happier note, it'd be a great 
kick in the ass of those politicians and corporations, and there's nothing 
I love more than that! ﻿

You said that in the future the fees will "hopefully" not be as much as 
current credit card fees. I am a little curious about that. What will 
dictate the amount of the fees, and are we then dealing with a level of 
"trust" that it will not be exploitable\exploitable?﻿
