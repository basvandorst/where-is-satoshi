Fold was a great deal when it saved me 20% but at 5% because you can't register the cards to get the periodic free drinks, it's a better deal to use the Starbucks app, but I still try to use fold because bitcoin. I would very much like to see Amazon cards, to have another option in addition to purse which can't be used for items without buy buttons

I just returned from Amsterdam. I didn't visit a "coffeeshop" but I was disappointed when I visited "Cafe Kobalt" and was told they no longer accept bitcoin or have an ATM. "Couldn't make any money on that" is what he said.
I've been surprised that it seems there's been a general decline in bitcoin acceptance.
Anyway, I use Mycelium wallet on Android.

Right. Just like the human population was once negative?
Of course "past results don't predict future price", but bitcoin adoption is has been exponential. This chart simply shows the trajectory "If" the doubling rate remains the same. A fundemental change could of course divert this, but I haven't seen one. In any case, it will be interesting to see how it tracks over the next year.

Wait what? So there are things you aren't supposed to do, but if they tell you what those are, then you won't do it? So you're saying they want you to do what you aren't supposed to do so they can catch you doing what you don't know you aren't supposed to do?

Good. All merchants have to do is send a payment request and if I still need a service I will push them the funds. But they want to just pull the funds regularly without your active involvement, so they can continue to charge without alerting you, so you won't decide to stop a service you no longer need. I say leave it "broken".

That sounds interesting. Of course the form factor could be a "credit" card. One thing that should be added is the ability to add a password when minting in order for the value to be verified. If in incorrect password is used to verify, it would show zero value, and be indistinguishable from an output where the correct password is used when the value is actually zero. This doesn't protect from confiscation, but it provides plausible deniability.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:40:56
That sounds OK. I suppose the private key is generated internally so it can never be seen by human eyes and it has enough internal entropy to create proper keys?
I'd prefer something non electronic which doesn't rely on an interface that will be obsolete in a decade or two.

Cotton and flax (linen) and some other fibers. Some percentage of the cotton actually comes from old levis jeans (or at least it used to) which are de-riveted, cleaned, and dumped into the pulper. I have seen the process, and they have a precise mixture of old levis (Yes, not just "jeans", specifically Levis).
It's technically still paper rather than cloth because of the process which suspends the fibers in a watery pulp, which is poured onto a porous fabric to strain away much of the liquid while the fibers settle into a flat sheet. the sheet is then transferred to a maze of rollers where the paper is further dried and pressed thinner. One of the rolls early in the process allows more fibers to settle in some places more than others which form thicker and thinner areas "watermarks".
Making Fabric on the other hand has traditionally meant "woven" although today there are many modern fabrics which are "non-woven", but are still usually a dry process rather than a wet one.
Also consider products like Kevlar, Tyvek and Nomex (all DuPont products) All are made from polymer (plastic). Kevlar is usually a woven fabric. Tyvek is technically a non-woven, and Nomex is technically a paper.
The type of the product has more to do with the process than the material.
So yeah, paper.

You're conflating two unrelated things.
1) Choosing not to accept credit cards is an unfortunate decision many businesses (especially restaurants) are forced to make because they can't afford the fees and chargebacks. This has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. If your insult intends to criticise that, you don't get their reality. I'm sure they understand the tradeoff.
2) Choosing to accept bitcoin may not be a huge part of business, but costs virtually nothing, and may add a cool factor. If your insult intends to criticise that, what are do doing here?

In a hypothetical example, I sampled bitcoin prices every day for the last couple months. In this example, I compared buying 1 bitcoin every day, vs. buying $104 worth of bitcoins every day. In the end, both examples ended with 53 bitcoins, but paying daily price for each bitcoin cost around $5900. Paying a fixed $104 every day only cost $5500. A gain of 7% just from buying strategy.

@_date: 2013-11-11 01:30:19
Me too. They seems nice and all, when they finally respond, but after I was whitelisted, it still took a week to buy. After a finally got an answer to that complaint, I was informed they had added another requirement for instant transactions (credit card). After I added a credit card, selling still takes a week, so still not easy to exchange, which, after all, is the only purpose of coinbase. If I could do everything with bitcoin, I wouldn't need coinbase.

I wouldn't call it "eating crow". That would be accurate if he thought that they did something and was wrong. The fact is, they eventually did what they should have done in the first place. That corrects, but that doesn't make up for the original mistake. Furthermore, this continues to happen, so the underlying problem still exists.
