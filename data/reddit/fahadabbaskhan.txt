I know i will get liquidated if the price goes low thats ok but what if the price goes up like 1000%
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:17:34
Thats math and is true but the real point is lets say if i’m trading with 10 BTC, it will turn out that bitmex now has to pay me 1000 BTC, where would the 990 BTCs profit come from?

Thanks for replying but you couldn't understand my question properly.
I created a vault in coinbase and saved keys and took a btc address from that vault and added it as watch only in my blockchain wallet but now when i want to spend money from that imported address in my blockchain it ask for private keys which i already have saved so how do i put those coinbase generated keys into blockchain wallet to be able to spend those coins?

Why are you lying here? Its still disabled and support isn't replying. I have already send an email at support+reddit but haven't got any reply.
@_date: 2016-10-01 08:46:36
How can i show the proof?
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:49:07
Thank you for reply.
I used the vault to get my keys and then i took a btc address from my vault and imported it in my blockchain wallet as watch-only address so how do i now transfer those $ from my blockchain watch-only to other wallets?
