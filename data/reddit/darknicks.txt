Please show me some proof of where I told you to f-off. The only kid here is you. I posted for the first time here 2 days ago and after several hours [you came here and told me to remove it because you wanted to post the same thing.]( Like, seriously? You wanted me to remove a top post that was up for several hours just because you wanted to farm some karma? Please, grow a pair. The internet is free and I can do whatever I want. I credited you even though I didn't have to but you're still crying foul. Grow up!


I'm the owner of this account but I just got into crypto. I reposted it and updated it because it's an important post. I will follow the mods advice of not doing it everyday though. So stop the conspiracy theories. You're just making a fool of yourself. How am I anti Bitcoin? Does that even make sense? If I was anti Bitcoin, why would I post something to actually HELP Bitcoin. That doesn't make sense. You're just making this up.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:30:28
Yeah and sadly Bitstamp is a bit expensive for US customers (wire transfer only)
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:22:44
Nice one! I'll try it out. Thanks for sharing! :D
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:19:24
I already did. You just check the differences between your original post (day 7) and this one + the comments because I actually help and respond pretty much all the questions that people have, unlike you that only post these things to farm karma.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:07:09
Excellent! Now they won't be spreading misinformation. :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:40:09
I don't think it's necessary for me to delete this one since it's already a top post. It wouldn't make any sense. 
You can go ahead and do it tomorrow. Sorry for not messaging you. I thought you were busy or something since you didn't post this after 2~3 days
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:13:37


Excuse me? First of all, I've only posted it twice, not "daily" and I've credited you accordingly out of good faith. I haven't prevented you from posting it because obviously I'm not a mod and therefore I can't prevent anyone from posting anything. 
The only reason why I posted it is because you haven't posted it daily as you said you would and since the post is so important, I decided to post it everyday IF after several hours you or someone else hasn't posted it already and I will continue to do so. 
Posting it once a day is not spam so that's just an excuse. If you had posted it daily I wouldn't have posted it in the first place and the day count would be way more than "9". 
I reposted this today because you didn't do it after 24 hours (check the posting time for both posts). 
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:52:35
Sadly I won't be able to repost it this because the mods don't want me to do it everyday. Besides, someone else already did it (he just wants to farm karma, not help others). So just look for the new one.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:09:34
You can get it for free if you transaction is over 10 sat/byte
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:25:05
Blockchain.info is the correct one.
I think TradeBlock website is either outdated or has limited the mempool size on their node.
[Here's another trusted website]( where you can see the mempool for BTC and a few other coins.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:05:09
Great news! Hopefully they'll release it soon!
Coinomi (Android) also said they'll support SegWit soon.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:27:12
Where did I say the mempool is empty?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:05:42
Gemini doesn't use order batching nor SegWit either. So they're pretty much the same.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:56:34
Thanks! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:24:56
Okay, I won't repost it everyday. 
Honestly, the only reason why I reposted this it's because I find it very important and informative. I keep seeing newbies asking the same questions that are responded in this post everyday. Most of them don't even know how to use the search feature so if they see a post like this in the first page of this subreddit, it would be easier for them. 
I'll wait 3 days before reposting and I will do so if he hasn't done it yet. I'll also remove the day count since this is a bit  confusing. That way people won't be like: "Day 10? Didn't this started like a month ago?". 
Or maybe you can make a sticky post yourself and copy the things that you think that are the most important from this post so new users will see it everyday at the top?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:09:42
Do they use SegWit? I don't think so. At least they use order batching.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:33:46
Grats! You were lucky that you had RBF enabled. People don't usually enable it before sending the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:38:10

Sadly, even if all the subscribers of this sub stop using their services, they would still have a lot more customers. We're pretty much a minority. Also, they're the only newbie friendly service currently available. Hopefully if Ethos goes mainstream, it will KILL Coinbase for good.

China FUD South Korea FUD. These people don't have any new tricks to attack on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:21:37
Hmm, can you post the TX?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:13:24
Here's another website that you can use to estimate SegWit fees: 


You can only tell if it's a SegWit address after it makes a transaction (spends BTC). 
You can use this website: 
Enter the TX. 
If it says "VSize" below "Size" then it's a SegWit transaction. If it doesn't then it's not a SegWit transaction.
[Non SegWit transaction.](
[SegWit transaction.](

Most banks allow wires but sadly most of them have limits. 
In my case I can't send more than 5,000/day online o.O
If I want to send more than that, I have to go to a local branch. -.-

Hey there! Here are the links for Edge (Beta) and BitWallet:
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:03:36
Yeah the thing is that the guy that was originally posting it "everyday", doesn't actually post it everyday. I posted it yesterday because the last time he posted it was like 3 days ago. Since he didn't post it today, I posted it. I'll keep posting it everyday if he doesn't because this is really important.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:04:46
They don't even use order batching, which should be the very minimum for any exchange to avoid so many UTXO. smh
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:03:19
To be able to take advantage of the SegWit TX discount only the sender need to has a SegWit address (input).
The problem is that, in this case, even though the sender would take advantage of the discount, then receiver will suffer from the high fees when he tries to spend the coins.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:36:43


I definitely agree. However, in my opinion anyone that has over $100 worth of BTC should definitely get a hardware wallet like the [Ledger Nano S]( It's way more secure. Better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:46:19


Yes, it's safe to do that. You can withdraw AND deposit to/from a SegWit address if it starts with 3. 
You can't however withdraw to a Bech32 address as far as I know
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:37:00
Thanks for letting me know! Updated.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:14:39
Yes, if you want to send all your funds from Electrum to your Trezor just go to the "Send" tab and paste your receiving address (Trezor). Then click the "Max" button to send all the coins and then click "Preview". You'll see several input addresses (all the addresses that had funds on Electrum) and 1 output address (your Trezor address). If everything looks good, just click "Sign" and then "Broadcast".
I would suggest an additional step: set custom fees. 
When you click "Preview" on Electrum, how many input addresses starts with 1? How many starts with 3? Is your output address (Trezor) a SegWit address (starts with 3)? 
Use the response to these questions to fill the required fields on [this website]( and set the custom fee on Electrum. 
If you don't see the option to set the custom fee then you'll have to enable it by clicking on Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Edit fees manually. When you enter the fee, you gotta tap the "Max" button again. If you did it correctly, when you click "Preview" again then you should only see 1 output address (Trezor's address). If that's the case, you can go ahead and click "Sign" and "Broadcast".
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:45:38
Oh I see, nice!
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:21:23
Sadly, not yet. Only Kraken does but they don't accept ACH.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:18:01
Please stop making a fool of yourself. 
Even though you posted it first, it is not copyrighted and it's not against the ToS.
Read here for proof: 




I gave credit. That was enough. I don't need your permission. Period.
Edit: You know what? This is not worth it. I won't post it again. Feel free to post it whenever you want. I won't do it again but please leave me alone.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:05:36
It's not very noob friendly but I just added it. Thanks for the suggestion! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:36:03
Wow I didn't know that. 
If you have an Android phone then you should be able to use Samourai wallet. Download it here:
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:30:05
Even though you're right, as far as I know, Trezor doesn't generate multisig addresses. So it's technically true that if your Trezor is providing you a 3.. address then it can only be a SegWit address. So the context of this message  is why I responded like this.

Yeah, all Ledger and Trezor products support SegWit.
Did you buy the Ledger Blue? It's overpriced imo.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:08:36
Can't wait for a full and easy to use implementation! This will certainly be the crypto of the future and will make Bitcoin price to go over 100k

Where did I say it's empty?
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:05:28
Yeah, sadly we don't have anything good in the US. :/
I guess the only thing we can possibly use is LocalBitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:24:53
I don't use Kraken because I've heard their platform is really unstable and buggy. Besides, they only accept wire transfer. It's not good for poor people like me that don't have the money to pay over $20 for a wire transfer. :/
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:36:34
Will they sell it for the current price or cheaper?
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:06:54
I guess the only thing we can possibly use is LocalBitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:37:29
Sadly they're going up again because of Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:56:58
Yeah, if the address starts with 3 then it is SegWit
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:17:13
Yep, I bought 3k worth of BTC last night. HODL!
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:09:06
Yeah, sadly. They don't use batching and haven't implemented SegWit. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:17:50
Sadly, Samourai wallet is not available for iOS.
It's only available for Android. :(
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:36:55
No, you can't use Bitfinex if you're from the US.
You can use Bitstamp but the withdrawal and deposit fees are a bit high.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:04:04
SegWit transactions have a discount. After the SegWit upgrade, Bitcoin blocks are using a new way to measure the block capacity called "weight" aka "vbyte" instead of the old "size" or "bytes".
All SegWit transactions take advantage of this and therefore the virtual size is lower.
The best website to check the fee difference between a SegWit transaction and a non-SegWit transaction is this one: 
**Non SegWit transaction:**
1 input and 2 outputs is usually 226 vbytes.
That means you would have to pay about 0.00115034 BTC
**SegWit transaction:**
1 input and 2 outputs is usually 178 vbytes.
That means you would have to pay about 0.00089584 BTC
As you can see, it makes a decent difference. That's why everyone should be using SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:36:44
Yeah, it's not really getting posted everyday.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:05:50


Exactly this... [Check my previous comment.](
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:11:15

@_date: 2018-01-12 15:20:43
Exactly this. I'm pretty sure that if they implemented SegWit, we would have 40~80 sat/byte fees again.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:52:54
Yeah, sometimes they're a bit off (about sat/byte). But they're really accurate about the transaction size so what I do is, I use it along with [this one to get the best sat/byte.](
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:39:17
Well it really depends. Moving your coins to a SegWit address right now will be a bit expensive. I suggest you to keep checking the mempool everyday. When it goes down, move them to a SegWit address.

Hey thanks for your kind words. I really appreciate them. :)
[A mod]( recommended me to not post this everyday. I won't do it anymore. Maybe every 3 days or so if he doesn't post it first. Since he desperately just wants to farm karma, he might do it before me.
