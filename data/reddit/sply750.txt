Shares do not produce value. The company only receives value during an IPO.

BTC team doesn't seem to be developing fast enough, or taking a lot of risks. I'm not sure what's on the roadmap. Are they going to do a proof of stake like ETH or is it just lightning. Lightning doesn't seem great.

Seems like we are in the "anger phase" of the market psychology cycle. Sad to see so many noobs get burned, but this is how we fill our pockets.

If it fails to the 3K support I think there will be more anger, or maybe that will be depression. Hard to pinpoint exactly. Everyone is strong hands until they are not. Some of the texts I am getting today are hilarious to read in a sad way. Crypto is truly the ultimate transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. I think I will delete my crypto apps and move everything to my hard wallet and take a peak in a couple months haha

I wont comment further with you, because I don't really care what you think. Crypto is an asset class, that's a high risk speculative investment. Key differences between that and gambling are 1) a crypto investment can be analysed where as a lottery ticket can not 2) there is a house involved with a lottery but there is no house in a market 3) crypto follows traditional market cycles but lottery tickets do not. 
Crypto in the long term, the price will be reflected based on fundamentals and will be overvalued and undervalues at various points. In gambling there is no fundamentals you are making a bet on probabilistic outcome of a specific set of outcomes. 
Gambling and investing exists on a spectrum of risk. You also are using the word, "tax" recklessly and seem to have limited finance knowledge.  Cheers.
