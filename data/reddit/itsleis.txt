Can you explain how binance coin works?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:12:12
It was a nice play on words, but people just are extremely aggressive towards any sort of negative implications toward hodling, so people refuse to even find out more about your project, even if it's pretty much ideal for the promotion of bitcoin and would have a lot of support here. I suggest coming back in a week or whatever and posting something informative and less that sounds like an ad
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:38:01
So if you exchange BTC to this coin when you cash out, you will have to suffer the volality of this coin just as much. Sounds stupid
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:46:53
What's BnB?
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:03:59
Sounds cool, but marketing tip: you're going to get stoned alive in this subreddit if you start your post by saying hodling is not the right thing to do
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:47:48
But the price of the coin itself is volatile

Dude why do you write in weird short paragraphs ? Also you keep repeating the samething40 times in the same thread. Shut up
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:50:11
???? So why would you suggest it edit:oh right, it wasn't you that suggested it
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:00:13
How do you short bitcoin?

Every TA sometimes fails when bigger things are in play, even for extremely liquid markets. Forex TA will fail on unexpected news for example. If every TA was surefire, everyone would be millionaires. That's not the point. The point is that this sub automatically screeches REEEE MUH DCA STOP TRADING REEEE whenever anyone brings up the mere idea. This is just a reference point, it's nice to know as much as possible about the currency or commodity you invest in but I feel like the people in this sub have become so cult like, so bent on the idea that nothing at all exists but DCA, that they refuse to even listen to any other perspective and just act rude to someone who spent their time trying to help people out. It's just fucking retarded.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:39:48
Always happy to help!
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:30:44
Hey man thanks for this analysis. I appreciate the effort you put into explaining it, and it helps a lot to have another perspective. Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:18:41
just bought $100 dollars worth of bitcoin, sorry for causing the drop :(
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:34:10
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:09:48
The people on this sub are fucking crazy. You show them a good technical analysis which certainly helps to an extent, they scream "fuck TA!!" This sub has become like a cult, any reason saying bitcoin may fall is automatically criticised to hell.
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:44:13
You sound like an Instagram influencer thing. GET RICH WITH BITCOIN WITH THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:50:59
The comments on this are fucking crazy. You don't even believe in ta, yikes
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:19:56
How old are you? Are you over 18? Most places will be more willing to help if you're not a minor who bought the bitcoins
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:19:01
Why do you keep bringing Switzerland up. How is that even related? Switzerland is a tiny tiny country and the people save energy pretty aggressively. It's like comparing apples and oranges.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:13:15
Some good advice op!
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:02:29
Right, I meant 13.5k or whatever,  at its peak. I trade euros. It is indeed too much risk. This isn't good for the heart ;_;
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:40:13
Whale went splosh, sold millions of bitcoin. This triggered a lot of sell orders and liquidations. I doubt bitcoin will keep going down, don't worry
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:18:43
300m was liquidated yesterday from bitmex or some other exchange
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:52:08
What's your favourite wholesome moment?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:43:25
I don't think Theres going to be a better time than right now, since it just flash crashed and hasn't recovered it's full price yet. I doubt you'll get better than the price right this second
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:51:53
Are you having a stroke?what are you saying?

They don't have an app but they're mobile friendly. It's not premium in the sense that you have to pay a fee. It's just a more advanced coinbase that asks for more id confirmations. Very worth it imo.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:37:35
No, pls, let it live ;_; it's suffered enough today
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:11:30
Bitcoin is boomin'
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:11:59
Whew who hurt you
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:35:03
The difference between stocks and bitcoin is that it doesn't jump 50% a month, 20% a day, drop 20% a day, go up 7% after that. There's plenty of relatively easy profit for the taking in bitcoin without doing a damn thing but buying and holding. Don't get greedy my friend, if you're from stocks them you should know psychology is a crucial aspect of trading
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:50:21
But you don't know when the pullback will occur, so you also risk losing your profits because it can shoot up without warning and leave you in the dust
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:22:12
Seriously bitcoin is volatile enough as it is. It's extremely risky, the flash crash proved it today (it fell basically 20%). Unless you're trying to gamble yourself to an early grave, don't do it man
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:55:12
Nothing is set in stone 100%, maybe it won't go up or maybe it will take weeks. You just don't know. What's your question?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:03:59
Coinbase pro survived
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:45:38
Why would you buy 13,700 coin?don't you mean sell? If you wanted to buy nearly 14k coin you got lucky it crashed
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:20:39
Yes, don't do it
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:31:44
Thank you (: I appreciate the advice
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:55
Why were you banned from coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:32
I know but I could have traded that dip, made a grand in seconds. ;_;
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:54
Noo it's about not getting that dip ;_;
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:32:53
Use an exchange that's less fee heavy, coinbase is one of the worst ones. Also coinbase lets you transfer between coins for free
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:01:40
Greed is a traders worst enemy. If it's any help, most people have suffered financial losses in their life, one way or another. Maybe it's good that you lost your money now to not lose more in the future.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:34:37
It was a joke I think
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:30
Fair, very complicated to do.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:23:24
Same, it's pretty amusing. Bought at 9200 to HODL, instantly within seconds drops to 9060. Classic bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:11:08
If you think about it in the long run what you lost is pennies. It's fine, my friend. It could have been worse.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:02:48
Are you having a stroke?
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:48:25
Yes but it also went up 20% yesterday and is still better than it was yesterday, shush
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:51:19
Look. You can't predict the price of bitcoin. It's a gamble, you may buy bitcoin at 9k but it falls a lot more. It may never reach 12k. It's vertical now, bouncing between two semi obvious stops, but it may fall or rise as it sees fit. It's bitcoin, it's not free money
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:05:26
Regrets are inevitable, especially with bitcoin I guess. Everyone has 20/20 hindsight, but it's so hard not to beat yourself up. Bitcoin is a hell of a drug
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:24:39
also, most of all bitcoin will be mined in the very near future (17.5m have been mined out of 21m) already. So that kind of kills the idea of it using sooo much energy
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:48:33
Because you don't have proper risk management, you don't use proper lot sizes and because you don't set stops. You fomoed in, gave into emotion when you finally lost all your gains. I know the feeling. It's hard to face. It takes a stronger man to get up after harsh defeat and keep practicing. Not to say bitcoin is the best market to trade, but these universal rules are the same everywhere for any kind of trading.
