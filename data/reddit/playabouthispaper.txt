Regulators is another word for special interests trying to generate tax revenue from our partaking in, and embracing innovation. The leech needs to bleed your pockets

The regulations of the current mainstream financial system as it is now are the haven of fraudsters and theives who have been grandfathered in. They don't like bitcoin because they can't manipulate for personal gain like they can with all other regulated markets that are obviously completely rigged

They are corrupt little lemmings, they are bought and paid for. The equivalent of a house negro slave. Simply put they are cheap whores with no morals and would never bite the feeding hand of their financial pimps.

Theres a war going on outside no one is safe from...financial freedom via bitcoin, or the beast system cashless economy controlled by shysters, fraudsters and financial fatcats trying to impose neo fuedalism through debt slavery. There is your line in the sand, pick a side wisely
