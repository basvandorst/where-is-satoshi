It's something OP told me in PM.
He might just be saying different things to different people so that they try different things though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:13:00
So I've been working on this quite a bit since yesterday, talking in PM with I could keep my progress private to try to find the password faster than others, but I think it's better if we all help each other and explain what we've tried instead of all trying the same things.
I have a 160-core, a 80-core and a 48-core machine at my disposal. Well, actually, these are shared machines and someone is actively using the 80-core machine, so I haven't used it so far. On the 160-core machine, I test around 12.4 million passwords per second. On the 48-core machine, I test around 3.6 million passwords per second.
So far, here is what I tried:
* All 8-letter combinations, with no numbers.
* Passwords starting with "electrum" followed with any combination of letters/digits of length 1 to 7.
* Passwords starting with "electrum" followed with any combination of letters of length 8 (no digits).
All of this failed. I'm currently trying passwords starting with "electrum" of length 16, with either numbers or letters in the two last postitions. No success so far.
I've also partially tried other things. For instance, I tried 9-letter combinations on the 48-core machine for several hours with no success.
So basically, this is going to be pretty hard.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:20
Three new things I've tried without success:
* Passwords starting with "electrum" followed by 6 letters, and then two digits.
* Passwords starting with "electrum" followed by 6 letters, one digit and then one letter again.
* Passwords starting with "electrum", followed by 4 letters, then 4 digits.
I am now trying passwords starting with "electrum", then 7 letters, then "15", and passwords starting with "electrum", then 9 letters (but this will take days).

That's the trick I'm using with btcrecover.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:17:24


Possible. Or maybe he just doesn't remember things well enough. First he was saying the password was probably 8-12 characters, most probably letters. Then maybe there was a 15 in the end. Then in PM he tells me he's pretty sure actually it starts with "electrum" and has 16 or 17 characters, but he's almost sure it's 16. And that these characters are most probably letters, but maybe the last two characters are digits (probably 15), but also maybe the last 4 are digits, or the last 6.
So... It's difficult with so much contradicting info. I'm not sure how we went from 8-12 characters to "pretty sure" it starts with "electrum" and is exactly 16 characters.
I've tried all of his suggestions and more with no luck so far. I'm trying "electrum" + 9 letters, and "electrum" + 7 letters + "15", as a last resort. Then I'll give up :-)

@_date: 2015-06-29 07:15:29
I don't get it though. They can't buy anything with their Euros, without SEPA transfers. So they can't buy bitcoins. If they could use their Euros, why not buy US dollars instead of bitcoins, which would be more stable?

How? If you send 25000CAD with TransferWise right now, you get 16301.53EUR (including the exchange rate, fees, etc.), which is equivalent to an exchange rate of 0.653876. The current "official" exchange rate is 0.657737 (given by xe.com). Which means that this method costs you only 0.59%.
Now look at [this comment from he estimates that with bitcoin it would cost you around 5.5%. Which is consistent with my experience.
So here you go, 0.59% vs. 5.5%. Bitcoin costs you almost 10x more.

I really don't get these threads at all. People are always saying on that bitcoin is great for remittances and WU is a ripoff etc., but then one day I needed to transfer 25kCAD to some account in the EU (in Euros) when I was living abroad. I asked on reddit and people were all like "oh but actually for this it's not practical, you'll have to pay exchange rates twice you'll pay a lot". And I made the calculations and it is true — transferring the money via TransferWise was *a lot* cheaper than going through bitcoin.
So until everybody gets paid in bitcoin and only uses bitcoin to buy stuff everywhere in the world, what good is bitcoin for remittances?
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:29:30

Yes but see, what I mean is that when says he "never thought this would happen in Europe" he means what's going on in Greece right now, not what happened back in 2010. I'm afraid a lot of the items in the list are more similar to 2010 than 2015. It's not just about defaulting.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:42:19
To give you some perspective, I bought mine at the very bottom of the 2014 dip, the scenario was almost the same back then. Bitcoin had spiked above $1000 and I bought at $250 when many people people thought it was going down to zero and never back up again (like you now), with a few crazies being on the "it's a sale" side. It's still ~30x higher than when I bought and what people thought was the most insane spike bitcoin would ever reach (&gt;$1000) seems low now.
Funny that you think "since 13k" is a long time ago.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:50:54
Nah, I promised to myself to not sell for 10 years when I bought. We'll see.
Also keep in mind that I heard for years that 1000 was the top and that bitcoin would never reach that again. A lot of people here seem to only have joined at the last spike and think it was unique.

Lol, a six-month insight. A lot of us on this sub invested years ago. And this isn't our first bubble followed by a burst, we've been going through the exact same shit in 2013 and before that. If you lost 65% in six months it's because you invested on top of a bubble, which is your dumb decision, not bitcoin's fault.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:02
We all wish something, that's the thing. If you didn't buy, you wish you had bought. If you bought, you wish you had bought more. If you sold, you wish you hadn't. And if you don't sell now, maybe in a month you'll regret you didn't sell if the price drops.
I got in at $250. I bought two, I keep regretting I didn't buy 20.

There is no plan here, nobody knows where bitcoin is going, it's a bet for everyone. But claiming it's dead because it's been going down for six months when the exact same thing happened for as many months in the 4 previous bubbles is ridiculous. If it ever bounces back up it will be in years, not months. Until then it will probably even go lower.

To be fair, since the $20k rush it's been clear clear that tons of people have been bitter to not have bought some before, and were rooting for its demise, and delighted when it went down to 3k, and these are the people who constantly feel the need to bash bitcoin.
The thing is bitcoin drives people crazy. It drove crazy people who bought at 20k and sold at 3k, just like it drove crazy people who bought at 1200 and sold at 250 after the previous bubble, which is obvious. But it also drove insane people who never bought and saw that they missed out on something that could potentially have made them rich—those are the people who yell "Ponzi Scheme! Ponzi Scheme!" all day long.
If you believe in bitcoin, just buy and hold, not more than you can afford to lose—and keep it mind that even if you believe in it, all of it is a bet, nobody knows how much one bitcoin will be worth in 10 years. And just ignore people who hope others will lose money because they are bitter about having missed out.

No. You can invest in indexes that average the global economy, such as an S&amp;P500 or even world index fund. You don't pick individual stocks unless you believe you can beat the market, and it has been proven over and over again that it's unlikely that you will, and in the rare cases you do it's complete random luck.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:43:56


Not really. You can also have a very diversified portfolio of stocks and know for a fact that, on average, stocks always grow over decades. Very few people invest massively in a single asset just because they're somehow convinced that it will "will overcome dips and continue to appreciate".
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:44:47
It's funny how when I was telling people during the last bubble that it was like the previous ones there were all like "of course not this one is much bigger!!!".
People don't get that if you go from 100 to 1200 and crash at 200, or if you go from 1500 to 18000 and crash at 3000 it's the exact same thing. The ratios are the same. The raw value of the coin is completely irrelevant. Actually, this time we're faring better since we crashed at around 7000 instead of 3000.

There are very few real users of Bitcoin (despite what this subreddit wants to believe), other than a few people on the Darknet. The main reason for its high value for now is speculation. If people stop believing in it / speculating, the price will drop to almost nothing. Which may very well happen after a few more years of speculators waiting for wide adoption and being constantly disappointed. If in addition to this, if another digital currency becomes more fashionable on the Darknet and people stop using Bitcoin, the price will easily drop to zero. It's a very likely possibility, and if you invest in Bitcoin thinking of it as being impossible, you're not being reasonable/rational.
(inb4 people claim that Bitcoin isn't just the Darknet and that actually everyone and his dog buys his lunch with bitcoins nowadays)

Yeah I disagree, the first time I've heard about bitcoin and I asked about it I definitely wanted to understand how the protocol works...
