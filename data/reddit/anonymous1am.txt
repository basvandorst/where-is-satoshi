I don't think this is a good idea.  There are not enough bitcoins, and amazon would end up with all of them.  Because amazon's suppliers likely do not accept bitcoin, amazon will not accept it until they have a way to get rid of it safely. Namely, when all of amazon's suppliers als accept bitcoin.  Way too risky for amazon now.  They will likely be a late adopter to the bitcoin  
EDIT: I made a goof

I think that possibility 1 is the most likely at this point.  BTCChina will eventually fail, which in the short term will massivley affect the price of Bitcoin, but in the long term, china will not affect the price of bitcoin as they have been so far.  Once BTCChina fails, the market will move back to the united states, or it will move to India or another country who is more Bitcoin friendly, and the price will begin to rise again.  This is not good news for Bitcoin in China, but it will end up meaning that we won't have to worry about a nationalist government controlling the price of bitcoin through thier back and forth regulatroy patterns.

Love that movie!  I was shocked when I recently found out my wife has never seen it...

Yes, I think they would.  At least privately, and maybe not the government, but the banks.  Even if the government makes it legal, the banks can still say that they won't deal with it at all.  If that happens, it effectively takes the liquidity out of china, and it will crash.  Personally, this is what I see happening already.

As a sort of analogy to the freedom of bitcoin, take the redbull wings and put them on a bitcoin, when someone buys it, they fly away from the bank with their new found freedom.  Or when they recieve it rather. 
Another Idea,  A person flying away from a bank on a bitcoin, with lots of people looking up at him. maybe with the bystanders in different stages of getting their own bitcoin.

So the person who runs the ATM is supposed to get a whole bunch of cash without a bank?

So if you are making a large transaction and feel like it would be safer to use an escrow service for free, try bitrated's escrow service.

A bitcoin atm would still require a 3rd party payment processor in china, because the exchange would not be allowed to work with the banks directly.

I agree, but does it make the sentiment less valid?
