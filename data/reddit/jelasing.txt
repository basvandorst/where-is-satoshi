Great points. Anything else that is advantageous, or is it simply best to obtain these coins without a middle man? Yes, I am uneducated in this..

Hi. Owner of a tiny amount of Bitcoin here. Can anyone explain to me how using Coinbase is different from using a normal bank?

That was not my intention at all, I am just curious. I simply got the question from my family when we talked about this, and the argument for Bitcoin is really weak when it doesn't have any (from an uneducated pov) advantages, so I am trying to educate myself.
Thank you for your help! :)

I can do exactly the same with a normal bank + more? I remember all this talk about decentralizing the banks, but it seems to me like Coinbase is just the same without the "extra features" that banks already have?

Thank you kind sir. I would greatly appreciate any knowledge about the subject of using wallets. If I knew how to use wallets, I would invest more.
I tried reading about the Electrum wallet, but I just got overwhelmed. I used my coin to buy some shaving equipment once, so I know it works, and as of lately, thanjs to Lightning Network(?) I can see it works faster than banks.

If it was not for Coinbase, I for one would never have invested in Bitcoin IOUs, and the concept of getting a wallet and whatever else is just too much for me to understand. I love the idea of blockchains, but some part of me is just waiting for the day when some software can "crack" it and reverse-engineer it, rendering the whole idea pointless, and making Bitcoin worth 0,-.
