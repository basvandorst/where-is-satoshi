I posted a similar question yesterday and got quite a few responses:

Thanks for the feedback!  I'll add that shortly.  On that note, what are your thoughts on showing the price in BTC vs. US dollars?  Currently the site shows dollars and converts to BTC on checkout.
Edit 1:  The first page (and second page for that matter) now list prices, including a brand new free trial plan!

I've used them about three times in the past three weeks and have nothing but good things to say. Last time I got the confirmation email before I had even walked away from the counter.
Of course I wouldn't be opposed to lower fees. :)

Great point, I've just finished adding that to the site!

It's great to see BTC being featured by so many major news outlets lately (Forbes, Guardian, the Economist, etc).  Unfortunately, many of these articles seem to focus on the black and gray market aspects.  I wonder what effect this will have on wider adoption.

Wow, great stuff!  I've implemented almost all of these suggestions on the new site!

Hey Ragmondo,
Glad to hear you like it!  That was one of the exact use cases I had in mind building it.  I am using Twilio, which has worked great so far.  Here is the exact text of the signup message you receive once you've funded your account:
Your account's been funded!   You have XX messages.  We'll let you know if your balance changes!  Text STOP to cancel.  btcbalancewatcher.com
When the balance changes, we send a message similar to this:
The balance at address XXX-XXX has changed.  The balance is now X.XX  
You have XX messages remaining. Text STOP to cancel.  btcbalancewatcher.com
