Make it censorship resistant. No SJW mod should be able to remove my account or my content.  Decentralize it so no state can take down a central sever or core development org.  Use something like tor for privacy or to protect those that fear state surveillance.

Yeah, if you want to invest in automobiles, it is a terrible idea to buy ETF or stock in automakers. Go buy cars and pile them up in your driveway. Your keys. Your cars.

I don’t see there being a crisis to bitcoin itself. If miners exit, difficulty will adjust to an equilibrium and life will go on. The crisis is for some farms who were too bullish and now can’t pay for their infrastructure investment or operating expenses like electricity.  Isn’t that a natural market adjustment?

You’re better off just buying BTC— dollar cost averaging.

Why?  I think it is a counterparty risk issue.  The participants in the network want to be sure they’re going to get their settlement on par for what was authorized.

Demand deposit account. But you’re more or less right in your summary. DDA or reloadable prepaid for debit card but denominated in fiat (USD is our case).

There’s sub accounts but one pooled account for the program owner.

I think we have to separate people and their individual positions on issues from their employers’ policies. Many of us work for companies that we don’t always agree with, so we say our peace, but then unless it’s illegal we do what is decided by management. The choice is to leave, but then who stays behind to at least speak up on the other argument? 
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:17:05
You must mean 0.043. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:58:42
It isn’t a technical issue. It is payment brand rules that require the card be source-linked to a DDA.

He made a fool of himself. I’m glad it is on video and saved for the ages :-)

Ok. I get you... I meant maybe (speculation), because I’d envision their code to handle 2x would be deployed well before the fork so they’re ready. That is common practice, because it gives you time to rollback and redeploy if there’s any problems when something is put into production. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:05:22
Do you mean the idea is DOA or are you really suggesting the “ASICS cartel” will actually put a hit out on someone?

Are you talking about the Canaan distributor?
I have ordered from them and had no problem. I guess I used PayPal though.

If it’s like a Trezor, the pin is to allow the use of the key.  The passphrase may be a recovery seed that you may use to reconstruct your key if you ever lose or break your device 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:11:37
But their statement about the fork and then subsequent reversal by their CEO makes sense to you? I don’t trust them.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:44:10
Maybe taking downtime to implement changes so when you try buying BTC you get s2x counterfeit instead  
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:14:38
Agree. Dollar cost avg into it.

Why does the core node code use only subversion to detect rather than service bit or both?

@_date: 2017-10-28 13:16:29
Hmm... and you’ve set port forwarding in your router to send TCP for port 8333 to port 8333 of the IP of your PC?  If so, check if your PC has a firewall. Other than, it would have to be your ISP blocking it. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:39:42
Yeah, I’ve wondered if the idea behind segwit2x is to just mux up the BTC chain (no replay protection) and taint it to the point that BCH is the only “bitcoin” that works.  Conspiracy?  If so,  yes and it would be criminal. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:57:41
It is this. I’m mining there and we’ve been lucky last 24-36 hours.

Not a lot different from founders of a new company owning stock in it before they make a IPO.  It gives them a reward for their investment. I’m not opposed to it as long as its terms are transparent/disclosed.

It is not safe to be on coinbase during the fork. Move it to a wallet where you control your private key. They take their sweet time committing transfer out, so don’t let it wait until last minute.  
Also, there’s a lot of wallet choices but Ledger and Trezor hardware are safest are both inexpensive enough that’s there’s really no reason not to use one.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:40:21
The key thing I took away from this was that core isn’t going take 2x laying down. I totally agree with the notion that 2x without replay is legal jeopardy for NYA signatories. It is a conspiracy to counterfeit legacy and if it causes financial harm to legacy holders there is a civil case liability, if not criminal due to the conspiracy aspect.

Make sure in the core wallet app settings you have checked the option to “allow incoming connections.”
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:56:37
Probably in admin-&gt;port forwarding... send 8333 to the IP on your LAN where you have the node running. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:41:05
Maybe show friend how to flip to inverse and find zero so he understands how much lower alts have go.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:19:05
TCP.   If all is well at the router, make sure you set the “allow incoming connections “ option in core wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:55:34
Conspiracy to defraud BTC holders.

You need a wallet app. USB alone can store a wallet file but isn’t an app. Phone like pc can be compromised by virus, keylogger, or stolen/lost. Get a hardware token and you put the key in it and it just signs transactions but never jeopardizes the key by exposing it. 
If you just have disposable BTC amounts, go ahead and use software on your phone or PC. Otherwise, use a Trezor.
