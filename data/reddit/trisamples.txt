I think 5k is a reasonable place for it to stop falling. This current dip might stop at 10k but I suspect some know the rally is over for now and are selling off for a long dip like last time. 
I know if I had some spare cash I’d be looking at 6-10months from now to buy not now.

It’s worth is not tied to USD. You can buy bitcoin with USD from someone willing to sell it and you can buy it in any currency too. If the USD didn’t exists tomorrow bitcoin would still have a value. To get more you’d need to spend local currency on equipment and electricity to mine more. That cost gives it that value. It’s real money alright with a value more directly linked and tied to demand than even USD that can be devalued by over printing or economic prosperity.

Those extreme religious views are new though. their path was created by external factors and manipulated. US action in the Middle East is in part responsible for its current issues. The US does many things, just look at somewhere like Cuba! I mean the US totally stunted it and killed its progress, the same is true with places like Iran but with a different set of factors.

Haha, those tweets were NOT written by trump he doesn’t even know what a banking charter is. The terminology was way off his usual pre-dementia riddled waffle. The dude is a grade A retard, expert level moron. Bitcoin is not a store of value, it’s a currency. It’s value is not baseless. It’s decentralised and not controlled by a government, if that somehow changes its function then cool, but it doesn’t invalidate it’s currency status. That it’s mostly traded vs spent on product currently makes no difference either. Whomever is writing these tweets knows little and that they feel the need to mention bitcoin and try to invalidate it, goes to show you how scared they are of it and how weak the US dollar is right now.

I think there was an attempt to link faith to level of education or logic. While it might be true, it’s one of those correlation does not mean causation arguments. Dumb people tend to be religious as do those who are incarcerated. I think it mostly that clever people aren’t convinced.

But surely she realises that coins used to be precious metals. They only moved to a token form for ease of use, weight and minting. Theoretically you can exchange a dollar with the government for a good of the same value ie gold. 
Bitcoin is great and all but gold is a physical, limited resource of known quantity with many many uses from phones and tech to space craft and research. If you find gold, like on the floor or after a relative dies, you need no private key to be able to exchange it for fiat or trade. Bitcoin as a currency is as doa as gold.  They store value in different ways for similar reasons. 
What excites me about bitcoin is that it’s never been  broken, the mathematics behind it is elegant and the issues can be resolved with very little physical effort. The parts where it fails are all traditional currency issues that can be sorted with adoption and demand. 
For me the main issue is privacy, if I spend money only myself and the vendor know what I spent in cash. No one is snooping on me and there is no account to trace. Bitcoin is not private enough for me and should not be for most people. I can imagine scenarios where accounts are identified by malicious agents who can then blackmail users who bought certain items from known accounts. Governments are already heavily watching it for criminals and you’re almost assumed to have illegal activity or be making money that gov was to tax. As soon as you dip in, you’re on a radar of sorts. Crypto like monero is the future, the trust issues are ironically far higher when you add in that privacy. It’s as big of a conundrum as the mathematical logic at its core.

The US is locking up kids and legal migrants and asylum seekers. They’re still persecuting minorities and don’t offer universal healthcare. Shoot people at traffic stops. The Iranian gov has problems and so does the US. Though it’s important to note Iran wasn’t always that way and it was the US that interfered in the Middle East affairs, pitting them against each other preventing a unified middle east. Reading some history books will make you realise there’s a lot of historic meddling that has held back or destroyed these countries with endless proxy wars.

Caveats it’s sterling silver not pure silver or 92.5% pure. A pound is not a current pound as the currency went through decimalisation and completely changed. The market cap or total volume of pounds has increased massively over time along with inflation that aided the economy to grow. 
That original pound compensated for inflation would be worth millions. What you could buy for a pound then is not equal now by design of fiat. What you should be considering is how bitcoin or crypto could be used entirely without inflation and how that would affect the natural inclination of people to value things more over time. If you owned a house and it didn’t increase in value over time would you be annoyed? Worth a discussion I think. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 06:09:54
Even if bitcoin used the same per transaction energy as the current banking system. They are not equal. One is a whole system of world wide fiat, with 3rd party services included, loans, credit, fraud protection, refunds, etc etc and one is just a currency with no banking services as such at all. Bitcoin is the future but it’s not a replacement for the myriad of services that have to be built on top of a system that is already using this much electricity. The only issues I have with crypto  are the lack of services and energy use. They prevent it from being anything but a stock. An let’s all be honest the ONLY reason anyone is excited about crypto is the trading gains right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 06:25:32
I get that you might want to buy sell fiat/crypto but why bother with physical cash? I mean you can withdraw from a wallet to an account and spend on card. However I have to say the idea of doing anything other than exchanging bitcoin directly for goods and services is pure madness. 
Crypto 2.0 needs to have all these bits built in. The merchant systems, refunds, loans, exchanges etc. Maintained with contracts that are paid for with transaction fees spread across the entire network so all services are free or minimal. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:32:58
Well there is a problem if it’s repressed by the government too. So they’re not wrong in a way. If bank accounts are closed when trading to fiat and tax man hunts you for capital gains because transactions are public then yeah a gov can kill mass adoption and make crypto pretty crap. I know you can’t stop crypto but they can sure make it a PITA. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:54:11
Bitcoin is decentralised and therefore laws aren’t applicable to it directly. The laws can however make it difficult for individuals. There are bigger issues with bitcoin though, mainly its lack of services outside the fundamentals. Sure it’s a good currency but there are no refunds, credit options, insurance etc and so will remain incomplete in my eyes. I hope there can be privacy and many other things in the future but it’s more of a proof of concept that needs some serious development. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:26:47
Thanks for sticking up for me, they know I was right that the majority of people are holding for investment and any illicit stuff is in the minority especially by volume. Moving past that stage was critical and now we need to move it to the next one beyond a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:57:38
"forced" to adopt a technology! This is the most idiotic statement I've seen especially as crypto is based on choice and independance as a fundamental principal. fiat has it's ups and down and so does bitcoin or any crypto. No one will ever be forced to use it.
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:50:24
I’m not sure that crypto prices will be stable either. While some maybe seeking safe havens from drastically falling companies, bitcoin etc are even less stable. It’ll only be a safe haven if it can remain buoyant. Usually savings get raided during a recession so bitcoin will go down from that, some will buy in at those lower points but bitcoin etc are not unlinked with reality. The only positive is if usd falls, you’ll get more usd for your bitcoin so savings will not loose value if bitcoin remains stable. I’d love to hear a proper evaluation from an expert of what might happen and why.

I like the 10k memes but bitcoin prices are kinda disappointing. Meanwhile, over the last 6 months ETH and LTC have outperformed bitcoin by almost double.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:31:11
I think it’s pretty obvious bitcoin has hit a bit of a lower wall where resistance is strong. It’s neither going to the moon right now or sinking fast, I suspect now is a relatively safe time to invest even if it drops well below current levels, you’re more than likely to be able to cash out with 50-100% profits. Everyone is waiting to see if it’ll dip more. I was in a similar spot when it was $260, it had consolidated but I had no spare cash, I once again have no spare cash right now but will reassess in 3-6 months. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:23:12
But it’s relative. Is the price now too high? I mean it’s kind of meaningless to say it should be worth more over time without knowing if that has already happened.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:16:26
Those two riders look terrified though! 
Anyone can see we are heading for stagnation right now. It’ll settle around 5k, that’s my prediction, even if that is a pointless and arbitrary one. 
I really love the tech but I’m more excited to see it break out of just being a investor’s speculative store of value. We’ve left behind the drug dealers and illegal stuff, it’s now time the next development stage begins. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:47:40
It’s not about the right price but the right time for that price. Bitcoin seems rather predictable in the long term and everyone is waiting for the long bottom stretch to invest, now is a terrible time short and long term it’s a loss. I’m very happy to wait for calmer consolidation before investing if I have cash at that point. Having patience is often overlooked as the key to trading along with removing any emotional hodl and to the moon desires. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:44:37
Three times more energy doing what though? Are we talking about purely transaction hardware? or the lights and air con in each and every bank as well? Bitcoin consumes electricity and is barely worth more than the electricity used to calculate bitcoin at this point. I'm not on the side of the banks but surely crypto should aim towards cutting out the need for energy use if it is ever to want mainstream use?
@_date: 2018-05-02 08:27:32
The problems with crypto are growing imo there is a fundamental flaw that makes it worse than the current banking system. Power, it takes power. Remove the need for power and you’ll solve all crypto issues. Until then all you’re doing is exchanging power/electric for a token, this costs both hardware and resources that are already too heavily overburdened. 
The current banking system has costs involved but ironically they’re much lower, until crypto can unburden the need for power, it’s screwed. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:08:42
Or... now we have universal healthcare coverage like the rest of the civilised world, so it’s free. And 2025 is nowhere near enough time for mainstream bitcoin adoption, sad to say. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:49:19
I don't know about you but BTC not being accepted is a big issue. The charges you get when you do, the slowness and the markup over fiat! This is not an advantage at all.
You need to go and look up electrical costs for BTC. It's currently sitting at 0.29% of total electricity usage worldwide!!!!
Knowing that hardware costs must be recouped too, the amount of hardware is staggering and DWARFS the banks who use universal hardware and systems that can be used for many operations. We are further away from a usable currency than in 2016! You used to be able to pay for coffee with it, now, not a chance. It's gotten worse. Sure as a store of value or for trading it's great but it's not exactly a currency.
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:50:41
Most traders are from Asia and they trade heavily with the market. It's also a very different market to traditional trading and is very high risk. I expect to see the same pattern repeat until mass adoption, however I doubt we'll ever see it reach the general public in it's current form. Also there is a lot of manipulation from large group trades and suspicious activity that HAS to get nixed too.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:43:26
But BTC also has flaws no other has. The ability to loose all money with a data loss, the ability to get tracked by a 3rd party who is able to charge your gains and finally the big one, ever increasing demand for electricity and hardware to maintain the system that already consumes as much as a small country. It is literally dirty money.
Now I'm not saying crypto isn't the future, but not in it's current form by any stretch of the imagination is BTC ready for the big time.

I’ve used resillio sync for years BitTorrent type file transfer network. I know this is cool but how is this not just a text version of that. I know they’re different but I just don’t see why it needs to use the lightning network for this task. What advantages does it give over other private p2p?
This would blow up immediately if there was a mobile app and it could work over Bluetooth, lan, Wi-fi, Internet. The only weak point is it being an app that can be blocked. There really does need to be a way to provide this kind of thing through a webrowser when you have no connection other than Bluetooth or direct connection of some kind from one device to another. It’s very cool though.

Meh, no on could predict such and that line is way too smooth in progression. Hodling long term is always a good idea but even at 10k, it's a very tough sell, to predict such a rise. I mean it pretty much relies on HUGE troves of whales to invest to push it to those prices. There would need to be a polar shift in access and uses for this to happen.

I think the big difference is that governments wanted people online and selling the service was profitable for private companies and investors. It was good for business, scientific research and many other areas. 
Bitcoin is a threat to government control of finances, requires one coin for mass adoption to be successful. Costs money to maintain with slim to no profits. The underlying ledger element of the tech is already in use by governments and businesses but as a currency is pretty much DOA as a thing that will break through. Now that is not to say it won't but it's looking further and further from becoming a currency that can replace  or even disrupt fiat currency at all. 
Only countries that have ballooning inflation like Venezuela can really benefit. Though I live in the UK, so might also be stocking up on digital assets my self soon. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:43:23
I would argue it’s just a gateway coin with a big market cap. It’s the language of crypto and remains the most trusted but it’s just a cryptographic store of value. It has no uses other than as cash. It’s like solar power without batteries, it’s not going to get adopted in its current form by anyone outside us enthusiasts. Claiming bitcoin is real but other crypto is fantasy really does undermine your commitment to crypto and your opinion, I hope you realise your hypocrisy.

Ironically pretty much everyone knew the first and second crash with long Valley would happen, it was clear from the charts. It'll happen again at some point and crash just like before.

It actually shows how solid bitcoin tech is. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:11:51
I suspect we are going to have a small run followed by massive fish cashing out of the market. As has been happening for a while. I don’t expect to see it drop below 3k but just above 4K is terrible performance for the last year, better off in traditional stock for most people. I still want it to be more than stock though and actually become a currency, easy to spend with low fees but it seems that end goal has been lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:25:59
The 10k mark is massive news. I suspect new cycle will once again go nuts over it. A crash doesn't seem possible but it may well be around the corner, I think because bitcoin is so hard to get rid of and exchanged for fiat that a crash is almost protected against by the exchanges themselves and other crypto is flat in comparison. This upward spiral looks very much like the first crash did though, getting in at 10k is madness IMO. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:51:19

I think it's exciting to be honest, it fascinates me to see the stock prices fluctuate and do unexpected things. The psychology of people holding it and the way it's progressing tech wise. Just to be clear I hold no bitcoin but believe in crypto and wider ideas surrounding this relatively new idea. With all the second guessing I would not be surprised if it both goes back up to 6k or down to 1k. There is a huge depression on the horizon for sure, so many markets are indicating it too. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:07:34
Gotta say I bookmarked BTC at $200 ish and registered to buy but forgot after it took a long time to get fully validated. I totally missed the investment opportunity so I'm now looking for this hype to fade and a big long dip to occur. Otherwise I'm afraid I'll never take the chance. Considering not much has changed with coin usage and acceptance, it seems over valued to me.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:19:26
Yep. Ideally a true crypto believer would say market value is unimportant and that only price of goods is. It’s a shame there aren’t people able to live within a bitcoin only economy and that fiat value is so essential. The dollar value is almost the part that makes crypto pointless as a truly different type of currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:21:58
Aka they want to control bitcoin and take away its decentralised nature. I suspect bitcoin might fall entirely into Chinese hands over time.

The odd thing about bitcoin is that for ages nothing happened the price was flat before and after the first bubble. It's easy to predict dips and be a clever dick when it keeps going up. I'd rather someone predict when to buy once the heat has once again gone as profits dry up. Bitcoin will have more long and dusty periods and that's when I plan to buy not now at $6000 even if it's going to 10k! On a side note, no one thought that WPA2 wifi would be hacked and yet it still happened. Bitcoin will still have that day it's only a matter of time. I personally want to use it as cash more than trade it and shops don't seem to have any interest in it at all.

Asic miners are the achilles heal of Bitcoin. They represent a way to mine coins at a faster rate/efficiency and then restrict who else gets to mine and when. Unless bitcoin can break away from asic, it'll no longer be decentralised and potentially become entirely controlled by businesses. Ironically it means stability but also corruption and insider trading galore. It's not really in the spirit of what crypto should be but hey it is what it is.

I feel bad for them in some ways but mostly not because they were driven by greed. At 10k pretty much everyone was saying it’s a bubble ready to burst, pile your money in for the short term and take it out once you’ve got your fill, those that left it in too long deserved to have their money eaten. 
The price per bitcoin has nothing to do with its use as a currency. It’s still not viable for many reasons as a universal alternative to fiat. Its currently dead in those respects.

Sure it's a fun ride to see a market so mental but when are we going to get to using bitcoin as money? That many countries banks are locking off bitcoin but yet the price rises seems to demonstrate that it's market performance is entirely unrelated to use as currency. I can only see it's value as a portal to other crypto currently but I want it to be so much more.

If you ignore those three ‘hype peaks’ this graph is incredibly skewed. It might look good but bitcoin has gotten much harder to invest for man in the street and heavily monitored. While it’s still a good store of value it’s returns are no longer life changing. Right now you might double your money in twenty years! That is a lot less attractive and this will be more true as time moves on. It’s also never experienced a recession and it’ll be interesting to see how the price reacts to one and also if usage as a currency is encouraged. I’d rather have the price track just above inflation and be useful as a currency rather than this over inflated trading plaything.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:22:37
Bitcoin is not instant, there is no credit, refunds or reversals and no overdrafts. Fiat is more stable and fees are pretty low especially if you do bank to bank transfers which is technically what you’re showing for bitcoin. 
Bitcoin as a currency has the up side of it being limited, a universal ledger and not issued by governments. But it has so many failure points and disadvantages it’s nothing more than a store of value at this point, exchanged entirely with the electrical cost of its production and nothing more. 
I love the idea of bitcoin but bitcoin 2.0 needs to have all the 3rd party ideas built into it and costs absorbed into fees etc. Then it can be called a true replacement for currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:18:11
If you buy now at 8k you are more than likely to double your money at some point within the next year just due to the past volatility, however there is nothing to stop it also dipping to 4k too. His prediction is pointless as time here is a factor we cannot be so sure of compared to the limits bitcoin appears to have in value.

If an attack happened, bitcoin would just fork. No one in the west would agree to go along with the Chinese if they tried to change the ledger dramatically. It would certainly be impossible for any sustained attack. I love the tech behind crypto but the weakest point will always be humans and the interchange of bitcoin with any value be it goods, services, other crypto or fiat. This is where China will attack if it can be bothered not bitcoin tech itself.

I'm not saying bitcoin isn't great. However 'the crowd' falls for all kind of frauds, other crypto based on dogs, Ponzi schemes, Nigerian princes and much more! The Crowd is almost always wrong.

I think it's a terrible idea to ignore fear and put your head in the sand. It's far better to remain logical, look at data and reason critically as to why markets move in the ways they do and why people say the things they do. 
Not everyone will agree with your opinions, deal with it like a big boy and stop being butt hurt. To many professional complainers in today's world.

Tether in a variable coin market would be fine. But tether where all coins move the same direction is a disaster waiting to happen. There however does need to be a facility of some kind where you can trade out to something more stable than crypto that is also crypto and not fiat. Tether just doesn't seem like it's the solution.

Not exactly what I would call a buy signal. Bitcoin has been very predictable long term. We all expect a long relatively flat spot for the next year. I think the way that bitcoin is setup with miners and investors that this spike, long dip will continue over and over again. There is also a hell of a lot of market manipulation going on with huge single buy and sell orders. I've seen those crazy trade clubs too, all very sketchy. I'd be inclined to wait at least 6 months for that flat spot. Hodling through massive drops is idiotic, please no one listen to these crazy people you need to pull out and re-invest later.

I would love to see state sponsored fiat to crypto conversions. Where the government of the country mines coins dirt cheap with renewables or something and allows locals to buy below the market rate. The citizens could then resell, invest or spend the crypto forcing it to be accepted as a second currency in all shops of that country. 
It would have massive advantages for citizens to essentially make free money and boost the economy without much internal investment.
I don't think we are far off seeing something like this happen. Crypto only has a few more hurdles now but keeping your crypto on a mobile would be ideal as 80-85% of world pop has a mobile phone now and many would be capable of this.
I can't see mainstream adoption happening unless it's fully supported by a gov and probably also matched with it's fiat so can be exchanged without much hassle.

Yeah, it's pretty much been shown that the spelling errors are purposely added as someone who falls for something with them is more likely to miss the scam itself. 
Also the more you hear something, the more likely you are to believe it even if you know it to be a lie. The scam works because it has now become a trope, something people now believe must actually have existed at sometime.
I really wish I had the source but I heard that the Nigeria scam emails originated mostly from the US when they analysed them. It's a very low tech method with little to no planning needed and stupid people can copycat on a whim.

Gold is useful, finite and cannot be replaced by other products, it's value will likely never go down. 
I love Bitcoin it's a beautiful idea but it can be replaced and change over time. It's more likely a fatal math flaw or BIP will render it valuable or worthless, not it's value in Fiat. If for any reason everyone wants to withdraw to fiat, a flaw/hack etc then the value could potentially be wiped to almost zero. 
The only way to secure that volatility is pair it to a service like ethereum. Trading is fun and all but that is not what will make BTC useful IMO, it's currently the gateway crypto to all other crypto. Its only current advantage is it's universal nature.

Swap USD for Euros, buy Bitcoin, swap for USD.
The USD and EURO are pretty much equal with about 350 million people who use it in their country so to see them depart from each other is a concern. Suspect that the USD is over valued and is correcting, Donny is making some enemies and things look to be getting pretty hairy as the US withdraws from the world.

IMO Russian has a different attitude to code and computers. So there are markets for what most people consider dodgy areas like selling software that isn't yours or hacking up software and redistributing to include ads. It's not because they don't think it's wrong but that law enforcement just isn't that interested in stopping them making money from non-russian products.

Sounds like a killer idea! If someone could encapsulate that into a single peer to peer app with graphs and trading it would be one of the best selling trading platforms out there and a cool game to play. I'm sure for a small fee it could make massive amounts of cash. There are so many day traders who could light up alt coin trading. Anyway I can dream. Thanks

BCC is destined to be a failure but it might be more of a success that we all imagined as every fucker is going to be hedging their bets on this one. Money to be made trading ICOs by people willing to risk it.

Is a Lightning Network a crypto currency exchange for trading for example BTC for LTC? If it is that's great! If it isn't, then someone get on it, thats an amazing idea.
I personally suspect most exchanges are safe but people and their passwords are very leaky. Sure there is probably more that can be done by the exchanges to keep them safer but there is also a huge desire to undermine confidence. I've not actually seen proof of hacking myself and when there is it's been user error.

I am looking for a shape vs a value. The current peak may continue but there will come a deep Valley eventually just as before becuase the public aren't yet interested in using bitcoin. A third spike will come when that happens and you need to be in before that one. I don't think it'll drop below $700 unless Hut by a scandal which I think we all expect will happen. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:49:37
Why would you though. Get people to donate to an address funnel out to an exchange vs going direct. Seems like trouble waiting to happen.

Ok I get ya. I keep feeling like I'm seeing different ways bitcoin can move forward to general public use and how it is currently used as a portal to other crypto making it potentially invaluable. I like the idea of Ripple XRP as a way to combine fiat currency transactions for banks to reduce costs and see that as useful in a different way and same with ethereum. But the need for 3rd parties to step in for the public to use bitcoin as intended is a shame considering p2p transactions can be made right now without them. I still see that as a failing of bitcoin design. 
Getting the governments out of the way is great and I can see that being the main reasons for crypto to hold value like gold. The current up and down against fiat currencies might stop or might settle down but it's all a bit unknown. I think the most interesting thing to see is if investors can pump and dump bitcoin again considering how far it's come. I'm not really interested in money to be made from trading but instead the underlying nature of the whole system and how it's developing. It's all fascinating to me.

Most people fall on a bell curve of agreement. It's why democracy generally works when not manipulated by propaganda. The best way to defeat propaganda is to not allow it and ban extreme views. How that can be translated to crypto is anyones guess.

I even think 3k was overvalued, there’s not a chance I’m investing this time. Even if this bull run goes 30k or 40k or higher, it’s nowhere near the multipliers of last time round. Sure you can make money but smarter people are looking for those life changing early investments that cost you practically nothing but track with bitcoin too. It’s very early days for crypto and the tech but I think investment this time is actually far more restrictive for the masses. Many banks ban buying it direct, it’s complicated and highly manipulated. I get a feeling this is a bit of a false positive.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:51:17
I never get logarithmic in vertical. It’d be better to show variance from a mean line drawn without value. Or even incorporate transactions rather than time taking into account transactions. Or just using candles at a minimum, they’re absent in almost all graphs but so important.

Without being in right at the start the second best place was after the first crash or spike. $300 was a very good price to get in at. I almost bought before the first spike but didn't and then again bookmarked at $200 after the crash but forgot to get a couple thousand worth again! I think we are in the bigger investor phase and will see another crash but nowhere near $200 again so money well invested.
I think currently all are over valued for their current uses, functions and limitations. Litecoin might have legs with segwit and adoption by exchanges. xrp and eth I'm unsure on but after a bitcoin crash might be big winners long term.
Once this current frenzy of buying is over I'm putting in my couple of grand but I'm hoping for a scandal which will come it's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:15:18
Yeah, I'd love to know too. Why does lite coin work with lower fees, will they rise as it's adopted?

I don't want to downplay the genius of Satoshi or whomever is the real inventor but essentially he created a digital lottery or sweepstakes where winnings can only be traded with other winners. There's no other systems in place to make it a currency as such, it's a very experimental social experiment that took off far beyond it's initial design. Unfortunately I think we're at crypto 1.0 and we really need 2.0 and maybe even 3.0 to perfect the formula. All the things the OP holds as values sure seem like one but only if he remains hidden and remains inactive. We almost want a selfish crypto creator who is locked out by his design but can remain greedy without the need to corrupt his creation.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:42:11
I guess I'm asking why there are no currencies where security and decentralisation are just part of the code. I guess it comes down to the need to update the code etc rather than it being set in stone, because it can never be perfect out the gate. I'm sure the issues can be solved though. The whole point of using a cryptocurrency is to remove trade barriers and reduce fees but the way it's all going all of those advantages are nullified. I think blockchain tech seems interesting but as a currency it's loosing its appeal.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:02:59
Ok. I feel like fees are exactly what digital currency was designed to get rid of though? I do wonder if a new digital currency could remove the need for them and make exchanges part of the currency somehow. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:54:05
I personally want a very very long slow decline in price that prevents the aimless masses following a trend. Once everyone has lost any belief in it put some long term cash into it.
