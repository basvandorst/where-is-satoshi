The Watt is an instantaneous measure of power. If you are looking at power consumption over time -  the time it takes to compute 1 billion hashes - then you are looking at: Power(Watts) X Time(Hours) = WattHours or Wh.
You multiply GH/s *  W/GH. That gives a result with units of Watts/s not Watts. This makes no sense. Did you mean "650 Watt/GH/s or Ws/GH"(WattSeconds/GH)?  Doing that would return a result in Watts. Then multiply by the time in hours, etc.

(09:14:48 PM) vbuterin: &gt;won't orphans become free-floating transactions again and then get re-included if they haven't been double-spent?
(09:16:15 PM) alexwaters: vbuterin: that was my understanding. can anyone confirm?
(09:16:40 PM) jgarzik: vbuterin, alexwaters: correct
"For any block on the chain, there is only one path to the genesis block. Coming from the genesis block, however, there can be forks. One-block forks are created from time to time when two blocks are created just a few seconds apart. When that happens, generating nodes build onto whichever one of the blocks they received first. Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer. More serious forks have occurred after fixing bugs that required backward-incompatible changes. 
Blocks in shorter chains (or invalid chains) are called "orphan blocks", and while they are stored, they are not used for anything. When a block becomes an orphan block, all of its valid transactions are re-added to the pool of queued transactions and will be included in another block. "

These updates and the core logic they define  could be in a form that is platform independent. The  core logic could be written in a scripting language that is built into the client. Maybe a JIT compiler could be used to speed things up.
The idea that the blockchain contains transactions AND definitions of how to handle them is appealing.

Here is a list of sites that accept Bitcoin: 
What does "get into Bitcoins" mean? If it means to hold some and spend them once in a while, then I'd say no it is not foolish. Just realize that at the moment the exchange rates between Bitcoin and other currencies are volatile due to one exchange(Mt.Gox) being over used and subject to manipulation. Spend whatever amount that you consider "play money" on some Bitcoin and try it out. If you want you can get some for testing at the "faucets":

One of the largest factors affecting mining profitably is power consumption. (unless your electricity is free)
In order to minimize power consumption one should use the most power efficient mining processor.  That would be ASIC. The controller, that which coordinates the mining,  should be just enough to do it's job. A server/PC is overkill.  I suggest a netbook,  android tab let, or Raspberry PI. Adding more ASIC devices just means adding more USB ports. By adding USB hubs this setup is more scalable than a server with PCIe slots.

Yeah. And NSA's new surveillance center in Utah will produce it's estimated 65MW(sounds too low to me)[ from composting every copy of the Bill of Rights in existence. 
No, I prefer that there are Bitcoin miners instead. At least they are always increasing efficiency in response to market forces and provide a useful service.  If the 1000MWh estimate is correct(which I highly doubt) then mining is consuming 41.6 MW at any one time. I suspect the "Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash"[ statement is quite far off the mark.
To put things in perspective they should provide statistics like:

If you can speak Bulgarian you can take a look at   .  Know that I just found this site and know nothing about it.
Take a look at Bitstamp.net first.

Too bad the site has nothing to do with what is most important: the  Bitcoin P2P network.  I think you should add a statement to that effect on the site.
Not doing so just makes this just another site that ends up confusing newcomers and the media about what Bitcoin actually **is** and probably will do more to harm than help in this time of DDOS attacks and lazy media.

"Is the blockchain forked?" Is incorrect. Un-ask the question. 
What you should have done is to create a site that monitors the blockchain stored running instances of the last 10 releases of the Satoshi client. Then based upon that you could show how they diverge. Anything else is just worthless.

It has confirmed. Not sure what that screen shot is from. Is it not available for spending?

**Important note:** 
A memorized passphrase *can* generate a private key. But a private key will not  generate the same addresses in the same order unless a *deterministic* wallet is used, such as [Electrum]( Unless a Bitcoin client  knows which public  addresses belong to it's private key, the client will not know about any balances in those addresses and they will be unavailable for spending.

Such a badly written, poorly informed article. FUD is right.

Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places, 0.00000001 BTC. Thus each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million individual units. This unit is called a Satoshi.

You need to provide more details:
* original software version
* new version
* bitcoin address you sent to
Try searching for the address in blockchain.info.

When is someone going to get this right? Difficulty does NOT increase after every block. It only increases/decreases to ensure that blocks are mined every 10 minutes. If the first Bitcoin miners currently were still the only ones mining(with their CPUs) then the difficulty would be the same as the day they started some years ago. What increases difficulty is the increase in computational power applied to mining due to competition among miners and newcomers joining the race.

I agree. I was content when it was at $13-15 for months.

Go to  your MtGox address here) . What does it show?

Is is synchronizing or re-indexing? It would be re-indexing if you just upgraded the Bitcoin client to 0.8. Either way, just wait. Any amounts sent to addresses belonging to this wallet will show up when it is done.
If your computer is slow when synchronizing then you may want to consider using an online wallet or a lightweight wallet such as Multibit(  ). They don't require your computer to do quite as much work.

Old news. And you are missing an "if" in the title.
