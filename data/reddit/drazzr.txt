Zane I can appreciate you're trying to answer a lot of questions and don't want to say the wrong thing or give the wrong idea, but this makes it sound very much like you are going to put it on the individual users of the wallets which have been drained. Please correct me if this isn't your intention.

why would they potentially destroy their extremely profitable exchange for something like this? Maybe a limited number of people on the inside. But if this is the case I think they have a much higher chance of being caught..

Best solution given the situation

this is straight up not true, you have no reason to think they also don't have a long position

 Should I be worried that the borrower defaulted and my btc is lost?
This isn't possible afaik, if they run out of funds to keep their position open they will be liquidated and your btc will be returned, there is a buffer to protect the lender.

It makes things a lot easier finding the right note in your wallet, that and not having to sort through a million 1 dollar notes ;)

No I didn't just happen to get it from a machine.. My friend did and posted it on facebook and I reposted it here.. But anyway the reason I posted it was I thought it was an interesting idea so it doesn't really matter when it came from.
