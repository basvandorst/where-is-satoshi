They specified that back when Steam shit the bed during Christmas purely because they couldn't figure out the exact cause from what they could see. They don't say that elsewhere because there's no need to, all of the data comes directly from Valve APIs.

But they aren't really full because I personally don't agree with some of the people using bitcoin (;

So what you're saying is, post two of each top level comment we make and down vote the duplicate so you can't pull this shit again, got it.

But he *did* answer with that as well. It's utterly foolish to pretend that digital currencies can't be used for bad things, lying by omission like that would just open up other doubts.

Yeah let me keep up with all this green paper we got handed instead of this single device that I already use for other things.

And it's pretty easy to make a customer want to use something. 
Remember credit card marketing back when they were first introduced?

It's really the biggest PR problem, for the same reason that everything is priced at $2.99 instead of just $3, 3 just looks like more than 2.99, and .01 seems like nothing even though it isn't.

I mean there isn't a lot he could do about it besides hope to find an archived page that somehow had all the same numbers that were on the current map.

21M is a core design choice, 1MB is a bandaid patch that was meant to be removed at some point

Surely if there's anything artificial it's the 1 MB limit, [people were talking about how big of a problem it would become 6 years ago for christ's sake](
