as stupid as it sounds...prob the china news that they’re blockingcrypto on their social media.   for the 55th time we get it crypto is banned in china.  but the 56th time some lame media channel mentions china ban...everything down 10% again
this is what happens when we’re holding something that has zero fundamentals.  traders dont know how to value it (no multiples to go by) they just pull shit out of their ass

here’s what I found, basically need a brokerage that allows shorts on otc stocks
TradeStation is the only online broker that we have found that let’s certain clients short GBTC. Since GBTC is an OTC instrument, it is not marginable and it can be very difficult to find a broker with shares to lend out for a short sale.

fb is the worst.   brainwashing kids.  and like mark cuban said...it’s a time suck
i dont see why they would withhold your money.  did you fund your account using credit card?  maybe you can have your cc do a chargeback.  explain your story they should side with you

something about him I don't like...maybe a bit too arrogant.  but I don't doubt his ability to pick stocks.  definitely respect his opinions
if you're still holding onto the short...you got balls of steel!  back when I was shorting New Century and all those subprime companies...i held onto them for only a few days at a time.  cost me a ton for covering early.

im the opposite
wish i had more when i goes up
wish i didnt own any when it goes down
call me crazy
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:54:48
that was Andrew Left's thesis for shorting GBTC.  but as long as you treat this as a trade rather than long term hold, you'll be fine.  This stock plays like a 2x ETF, you get more action with this thing both directions

if it drops to $100 why would it stop there.  is there some insane support at $100. why not $10.  or go negative....the miners pay us to own coins
get real

i'm just praying for 10k at this point

if you’re into TA...6600 was around the last bottom a couple months back.  which was the price a few hours ago
but last time there was a quick bounce...didnt happen this time

@_date: 2018-03-15 12:10:22
All those reasons are basically saying btc price is still higher than 3 years ago...
That doesn't help people that bought in last 2-3 months.   These people don't care about hashrates or transactions 3 yrs ago.  Dare you to show the same charts since December.  It's not pretty

think gemini has one of the largest max withdrawal limit out there but will take time to verify your identity
if you’re already verified on coinbase go there.  ask support to raise your limit.   their support sucks but its the only way to raise your withdrawal limit

gdax for trading...

@_date: 2018-03-31 01:31:47
yea was trying to read chart on my phone. it was much lower than 6600.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:56:03
think longer term than "days".  if you don't think bitcoin will be over 8k by summer, then you probably want to bail
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:41:41
fair enough.  i first bought in 2014.  but i didnt follow forums until 2017.

let’s see if this works again today...btc is currently trading at $10,550 on coinbase about 2 hours before market opens... will check back in an hour...
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:18:24
yup.  bitcoin is dead.  media can now fuck off and stop the FUD stories for clicks and views.  leave us alone

from what I can find online...appears Indonesia does not allow non-rupiah currencies for transactions, it's not really a bitcoin ban, it's just reaffirming their stance on using local currency only.    and if that's the case, banning transactions doesn't sound like it's banning owning bitcoins.  you should check the laws, if owning isn't an issue, I would just hold onto it if I were you, maybe in the next couple years the rule will change.
below is what I found online regarding "Indonesia bitcoin ban":
The ban from using cryptocurrency abides by Law No. 7/2011 of the country that stipulates national currency rupiah is the only authorized currency allowed for transactions in Indonesia.
"Financial service providers in Indonesia were strictly banned from taking bitcoin in their transactions. There were sanctions for those violating this rule,"

of all the things to say about crypto he talks about deaths?
thats like saying windows caused deaths and all the bad stuff going on in the world (via browsers —&gt; forums —&gt; bullying etc)

this article title is click bait / fake news...whatever you want to call it.   
it’s missing a HUGE keyword..its just a sample size of people who filed taxes with Credit Karma.  dont know who the hell uses them to file taxes. but that 250k is just a non-random sample size. 
IRS would NEVER announce something like this
here’s a more complete version of the story
