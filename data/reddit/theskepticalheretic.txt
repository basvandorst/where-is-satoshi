A lot. Legal reach extends well outside of national borders when it comes to commerce. Indicting the CEO for trade violations is a really big deal.

It's not arbitrary. In order to trade equities, you must subject yourself to a particular level of financial scrutiny. Otherwise you cannot engage in certain types of transactions. The CFTC found that Coinbase had to either re-register correctly, or not engage in that type of transaction. So coinbase changed the way they did transactions, and it resulted in a security failure.

Yes. It's a quasi-governmental institution that is run as a non-profit at the behest of, but not beholden to, the US Government. I can understand your confusion as there's a lot of propaganda about what the Fed does. 


This is not how the Fed works. 


No I said the statement was grossly ignorant. If you believe said statement to be true, it would imply you are ignorant of how production feeds into the economy and how it is measured. Most people are. 


It depends on the production we're talking about. Overall GDP or GNP doesn't always increase. Further, efficiency makes up for shortfalls in production. 


Sure, the fact you create more of something doesn't mean that the more you create is 'extra' or 'additional'. The population grows, export grows, wealth is both created and destroyed in production. Not all production is necessarily beneficial economically. Further, production is far more complex than "we make more each year so everything should get cheaper." Which is exactly what you're saying.

Why do you think there should be such an option, and how exactly would this result in an increase in economic prosperity? I ask because we've had multi-monetary systems in the past, and each time this occurs it results in negative outcomes for all currency holders with little exception. 


I don't see how I've done that and I don't see someone earning income just by virtue of existing to be liberty. It certainly isn't power, so perhaps you can tell me how this is liberty, or perhaps your usage of liberty is different from mine. 


Having the ability to borrow money to do something you couldn't do otherwise is an increase in your economic liberty. Hiding your money in your sock drawer and having it magically increase is not liberty, it's magic.

This is pretty silly. You do know what happens with the money the Fed makes as profit, yes? It goes directly to the Federal government for purposes of paying the debt. 


There are several elected officials in the Fed. They're not publically elected, but they're not installed without debate. Further, the person who installs the leader of the Fed is elected by public/electorate vote. So what's your disagreement with this practice?


You could always take a sixth-grade civics class too. I find it interesting that you say my argument is lazy when all you're doing is saying whatever someone else told you and providing no sources for your stance. You assert the Fed is a monopoly/cartel that fixes the price of the US dollar. I say that isn't correct. So if we're going to do the source game, go ahead and take your turn first. 


Uh huh.


I'm sure you don't think for each ounce of gold we mine this year that we will mine an additional 1.1 ounces of gold the following year. Production is constrained by a multitude of factors depending on efficiency, resources, and costs. If you want to talk about a specific market, we can do so. If you want to talk about Macroeconomic generalities, then we're not going to get anywhere. 


Considering your argument was "always" and it is demonstrably false, I think it's a bit stronger than yours. 


And the standard of living increases, devices considered required for normal social activity increase in complexity, soaking more of our production capabilities, etc. As I've said, it's complicated.


Capitalism hasn't weeded out weapons manufacturers or war, which are two of the greatest wastes of wealth and productivity we have ever engaged in.


Considering what I'm replying to, I'm pretty sure there was never a way to convince you of something other than your ideological beliefs.

No you're not. 


This would be the only example of force you can provide. If you have no tax burden, you're not required to use your national currency. Many people live without touching their national currency. It's difficult, but it's not impossible. Further, you can move. Your whole argument is about choice. You have choices. 


Bitcoin seems to be working just fine according to this sub. The Liberty dollar violated a very specific law involving the creation of currency using precious metals. Here's the text of the provision:

Deflation is a form of debt slavery. Let's say I make you a loan for $400. 
Then we start deflating currency. Your employer corrects your wages downwards (because that's what happens during deflation). Now that $400 debt you owed is worth an equivalent $4000 after deflation. Meanwhile, in the reverse scenario featuring inflation rather than deflation, your wages correct upwards, meanwhile your debt stays stagnant, meaning your debt is worth less and less as time goes on. 
Which would you prefer? Deflation is a lot more like feudalism than inflation is like theft. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 12:24:31


If you think the requirement to transact for tax purposes to be force akin to "Cartel and monopoly behavior" then you're very far from what you need. 


Not true.


You've heard of System D, yes?


The government doesn't come burn down your house and kill your kids if you miss a tax payment. Further, the mafia doesn't have a legally limited jurisdiction, or a form of recourse if you feel you've been wronged. Liberland propaganda doesn't carry much weight with me. If you can't make your case then that's too bad. 


Not accurate. If you think it is, give me a few sources supporting your stance. Liberty dollars weren't financially recognized. Bitcoin has been financially recognized. If the government wanted BTC shutdown they'd simply pass a law or order stating transactions in BTC were a crime akin to subverting the government, as they have with precious metal backed notes and other 'self-minted' mechanisms.


That isn't what I said. Further it seems nuance is a foreign term to you.

No, I don't think deflationary increases value per se. 
The definition of deflation is an increase in the value of currency relative to the cost of living. This can also be phrased as a decline in the cost of purchasing goods and services relative to the currency. 


This is irrelevant to what we've been talking about.

They won't show up at your house and shoot you for being in arrears on your taxes. Burden of proof not satisfied for your claim. Hell they barely even responded to the Cattle Rancher posse when they took and held federal land in acts of domestic terrorism. 


And what do you think the solutions to problems under a voluntarist system are? That is what you're advocating. There's virtually no difference between what you're promoting and the status quo other than 'no government telling me what to do'. Well, if you want to get rid of economic laws and enforcement, good luck. It's not only stupid and dangerous, but would result in negative outcomes you'd find more distasteful than the current paradigm. 




And they wouldn't necessarily be wrong. Attempting to subvert the economic health of the US is what terrorists try to do. That was the stated goal of Liberty dollars.

Try to condense your replies to one thread and make them all at once. This bouncing back and forth is annoying. 


The Fed doesn't have a crystal ball that tells them which stocks will do well or fail. They also do not have the ability to trade in many market vehicles by law to prevent exactly this course of action. It's called market manipulation and it sends people to jail for a long long time. 


When talking about nuanced subjects, it requires semantics. This is especially important when talking to someone who uses every rhetorical trick in the book because they haven't actually looked into any of the things they're saying. 


Would it be as poorly sourced as the rest of your writings on this topic?


Oh boy, you really don't know how to source an argument, do you?


So weak example.
Except your chart shows exactly what I said it would. Gold production does not increase each year as shown by several recessions in production. Production does not linearly increase by 10% as you assert it does. So once we source your argument with data we can see your argument is false. 


How would you like to examine this market? Do we want to look at the changes in labor and transportation costs, the changes in margin at wholesale and point of sale, the changes in the use of rare and precious metals in manufacturing? You need to be more explicit. How is it deflationary? What aspects of the computer sales industry are deflationary?


In some cases yes, in some cases no. It depends on how you're measuring productivity as well. Overall, productivity increases, the standard of living increases and the value of individual bank notes decreases. This is the current paradigm for most people in the western world. If we went to a deflationary currency, this paradigm wouldn't be the case. 


And every time you make a $10,000 bomb and use it, you've destroyed a minimum of $10,000 worth of productivity. If you're going to push the "breaking windows makes window makers rich" line of argumentation it's not going to be a strong argument.

A single currency monetary system does not satisfy the defintions of cartel or monopoly. Explain what you mean if you would. 


Eh... you sure you want to say this? Not all voluntary decisions result in win-win outcomes, and it is pretty far from a default. 


Nope. Fiat currencies hold sway because for the types of actions people want to do it is a better fit than other forms of currency, like gold or other precious metals. 


This doesn't follow. 


The option is heavily disincentivized as you'll always be paying back far more money than you borrowed in addition to the interest on the money. A loan under a deflationary currency would be more akin to a credit card you attempt to pay off by sending only minimum payments. 


Nope, see above.


There's significantly more to it than "it's a matter of contract". When you say something like "It's a matter of contract" and provide nothing further, you're basically saying something akin to "You can fly without any additional technology, it's a matter of evolution." There's more left unsaid than you advertise, and the devil is in the details.

Yes, that would be inefficient in the extreme and impossible to support via an HTTP endpoint, so I'm not sure it's relevant.
It's relevant only because you're looking at a multi-GB file as a multiGB file on the network, when the reality is, it's split into millions of frames and sent across in pieces. If sent via TCP/IP that means there's a wait for acknowledgement after each frame. The frames are very small, and ack is very quick, until you implement some sort of delay for each frame. Adding a few hundred milliseconds wouldn't be over the whole size of the file. It would be after each frame of the file sent, which means adding possibly hours to a download.

Ok, well I can give you some guidance. Under KYC/AML you are supposed to collect PII about your customer, including the source of their funds. You are not allowed to use this information to solicit services to them, or to market products. That's the piece you're missing here. The questions asked are required by compliance. Using the answers to those questions to sell services is a privacy violation and considered against the law. 


For coinbase to sell to the Icelander they'd have to have the appropriate licenses if Iceland requires them, meaning the company would have to be compliant with both Iceland's law and the law of which ever country they're headquartered in. 


Right so it has nothing to do with the type of information collected, it had to do with how they handled said information. Thanks for making my point. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:36:59


From [here](
*What are the high level requirements for verification of customer identification information (individuals and legal entities)?
A9. The institutions must identify their customers in compliance with the UCB requirements when they open accounts or when they process
transactions, with the exception of transactions with occasional customers below USD3,000. The UCB regulations establish the minimum
identification requirements for individuals and legal entities.
For individuals these requirements are:
a) name and surname;
b) date and place of birth;
c) identification document;
d) marital status;
e) address and telephone number;
f) main activity or occupation; and
g) volume of income (salary and other earnings).
It should be ascertained whether the customer is acting on their own or on behalf of a third party. In the latter case, the ultimate beneficiary
should be identified. The same information should be obtained on all owners, agents, representatives and those authorised to operate on
behalf of individual clients. It should be ascertained whether the information on level of incomes of these customers constitutes the source of
income of the account.
For legal entities these requirements are:
a) company name;
b) established date;
c) address and telephone number
d) tax identification number;
e) bylaws and other information on the entity as registry number, etc.;
f) main activity;
g) volume of income (on financial statements); and
h) shareholders and ultimate beneficial owners.
The above mentioned data required for individuals must be obtained for those listed as corporate managers and representatives, agents
and those authorised to act on the company’s behalf. It should be ascertained whether the information on level of incomes of these
customers constitutes the source of income of the account.*

Bitcoin isn't backed by any sort of physical asset. To assert it isn't pegged to USD doesn't necessarily make it so. Basically, USD is the reserve currency of the world, so an unbacked asset is typically in some way tied to the value of the reserve currency. Bitcoins wouldn't hold value if the dollar loses value in this scenario for many possible reasons, the primary one being the lack of transactions into bitcoin from USD. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:23:10

@_date: 2016-03-29 20:17:21


Which would imply a decrease in demand, but I don't think you mean to imply as much. 
Here's the problem with the way you're looking at this. There are X number of coins in the world mined. Per block the supply of coins increases by Y making Z (the total number of coins).
X+Y=Z. 
Z is the supply. So if you change the value of Y, that doesn't decrease the supply unless Y is negative. One would expect the price of bitcoin to decline if it was purely based off of supply and demand with each new addition of coins. Bitcoin isn't supply constrained. There aren't too few bitcoins to go around. So a decrease in the increase in supply won't change the price.

Sure, but let's look at this particular market environment. Are you operating with the understanding that the demand for bitcoins outstrips their creation?

Don't confuse policy with practice. If you notice, monetarism hasn't really made a resurgence and our understanding of economic mechanisms have become significantly more rigorous. 


If there is no wage correction, people are gaining dramatically more purchasing power. That's not a bad thing for people. Companies would be paying their employees too much. If you're making 100k a year and have 20k in debt. Deflation hits and you continue making 100k, that 20k in debt is no better or worse. That isn't what typically happens though. Deflation leads to wage correction downwards as with less of a wage you can still maintain the same quality of life and employers aren't in the business of paying far more than you're worth to them. 


What indicators are you referring to?


You're adding a lot of adjectives that probably don't carry the weight you think they do. All you need are a few major processors to run the new client and boom, coins are valid. 


This is a different change carrying different risks. A change in the total amount of coins is much easier than a change to the blocksize due to entrenched hardware rather than ideology. 


Three months of stability does not a store of value make.

I'm guessing you don't have a lot of background in econ. My background in econ is very limited but I see problems with what you're saying for these reasons:
* 1. Demand is already met.
* 2. Supply continues to increase.
You're still trying to treat new coins and old coins as different things. They're not. Assuming little to no coin destruction the supply is still continually increasing and the demand is not. There is no reason why the value would increase in this scenario. If anything it would decrease. So tightening the creation of new coins will only serve to lessen the price drop over time, it would not somehow increase the price. Miners will always have the same amount of sell pressure because that pressure is an external to the bitcoin ecosystem. They have to pay their costs. Their sell pressure is based entirely on their costs of production. So if they're getting less coins for the effort, and the demand isn't there to support a price increase, the only thing you're going to see is more and more miners shutting down. 
The halvening is really really bad for bitcoin price, and for the bitcoin ecosystem according to fundamentals. If there isn't an increase in demand, bitcoin will eventually die out due to these same fundamentals. The main reason is that bitcoins become harder to create, meaning the creators of said coins lose their profit margin and are incentivized to no longer mine and do something else.

Economics has made a big shift from being more philosophy and policy to being quantitative.

This feeds back into economic models making them more representative of reality as opposed to hand waivey policy nonsense. 


No. In deflation, absent wage correction, each dollar an employee is paid is worth more than it was before deflation. So if you make 100k and bread costs $2 before deflation, you have a deflation event dropping the price of all services and goods by half, meaning bread is now $1, that 100k goes twice as far. It would be a doubling of purchasing power. 


Hash rate is due to technological advancement and optimization, It does not speak to bitcoin growth directly. VC investment is primarily in blockchain technologies, not necessarily in bitcoin. The two are not the same thing. Bitcoin is a block chain technology but it is not the only one, nor is it necessarily the one drawing the most VC. Also, VC investment in Bitcoin is down from last measured year.

I find it funny that people think there's any sort of voting in bitcoin. There's no mention of it within the literature for the system. Further Bitcoin XT never captured more than what 1 or maybe 2% of processing nodes. Non-full nodes sure, they had a bunch, but those don't do shit for the network.

No. You were doing business with Coinbase who was doing business as you with Expedia. Expedia doesn't transact in Bitcoin. 


Not if the cause of the failure was the bank failing to pay the merchant. If you swipe your card and it says "Declined" who do you call? I'm assuming you're not calling the merchant. That is effectively what happened here. Coinbase is acting as your payer. They failed to pay, which is why you don't have a booking and Expedia isn't calling you back. 


That expectation is in error. Expedia doesn't have a transaction with you because Coinbase failed to pay them. Your bitcoin flowed from your wallet to a Coinbase wallet. Expedia didn't get their fiat. So you don't have a booking and Coinbase owes you money.

Fiat monies aren't backed by physical assets but the value of them is controled by the willingness of participants in economies to accept them. It is similar to bitcoin in this respect, however fiat currencies are pegged to the assets of the governments that create them through for example, being the only accepted currency for purposes of paying tax. 


But CAD isn't pegged to USD. CAD is valued as such by the government backing it through practices like accepting only said currency for the payment of tax, etc. 
Bitcoin has no such backing. The value is entirely decided by the will of the market participants and their ability to trade into or out of it. If no one outside of the bitcoin ecosphere values bitcoin then it is entirely valueless and has zero backing, like the Zimbabwean dollar. 


Depending on your perspective it did nothing or it rose. The dollar sank in value compared to a fixed unit of gold. This is basically a relativity problem. You can pick which asset you want to fix in price and count the gain or loss against the other. The US dollar softened after the announcement and this involves a whole host of other factors.

I didn't realize you were going to claim knowledge you don't have. 


Entirely depends on the factors of the market environment. Usually it will trend downwards, however, if there isn't enough demand to consume the supply, usually the price stays the same or trend downwards. An increase in supply doesn't increase demand, or necessarily decrease price.

Have any evidence of this?


The total future supply is capped but the current supply is not. The rate of creation is somewhat fixed, but there are coins lost and burned quite often as well. 


So if bitcoin's effective supply is elastic, as any positive movement in price increases the supply of coins available for purchase, due to former holders; without positive motion, holding doesn't impact price in this paradigm, which is what I said in the first place. Holding doesn't positively impact price in the current environment.

Whether I like it or not is completely irrelevant. The question is whether it satisfies use cases that other forms of currency transfer do not. The answer to this question is no, it does not satisfy use cases in which there is no alternative because such use cases do not exist.

Evidence of miners selling their coins as soon as they receive them. Try utilizing context appropriately. My meaning was quite clear. 


You've been asserting that holding coin increases sale price. Miners immediately dumping coins would speak against this mechanism you're trying to convey. So which is it? Does holding increase price, thereby incentivizing miners to hold part of their mined coins or does it not impact price, resulting in miners dumping all coins at minting? It doesn't make sense to hold to both principles simultaneously.

Couple problems here:


Why? What makes a new coin different from an old coin other than the transaction history of the coin? 1BTC=1BTC. 


Not really. Inflation is a little more complex than an increase in the money supply. Inflation is a sustained increase in the price of goods and services. Inflation can also be seen as a decrease in the purchasing power of each unit of currency. If the number of market participants increases in line with the creation of new units of currency you can increase a money supply without inflation. Many people conflate the two things because they often seem related, but there's a difference between the two.


Well deflation works just fine when you're in debt. It just sucks for those who have the debt as the value of their debt increases at the rate that the value of a currency unit does. This isn't a problem unless there is also wage correction. Meaning you earn a smaller quantity of dollars, maintain the same purchasing power, and your debt does not decrease in line with the decrease in your wage. That's why deflation is bad for those in debt. 


Scarcity can be a source of value but only if there is demand for the resource. Lanthanide metals were scare in the 50's. They were not that valuable until we began the nuclear and computer ages and began using them, increasing demand for them. Scarcity by itself means nothing. 


Well... it can. There's nothing about the protocol that prevents more coins from being created. There's just a limit currently set at 21 million. It can be changed. Further, i think the ideology in the BTC-o-sphere is that you will simply subdivide a BTC into smaller and smaller pieces to adjust the supply, similar to what China did to the Yuan. 


The wild volatility over the short term really discourages use as a safe store of value. 


This doesn't really follow. If you can elaborate perhaps I can agree or at least see what you're trying to point out. 


This is not true. Changes in sell pressure on miners do not translate into purchase pressure for users. There's no direct relationship there. 


I disagree for reasons I stated previously, but I'd like to add that we've had a halvening with no commensurate bump in price. Multiple other crypto-currencies have had their halvening with no increase in price. I wouldn't bet on an increase due to the halvening.

The converse is also true. Your assertion that the price didn't go as low as it would have because of holders is not borne out of data. It's your poor assertion, just like your other poor assertion that there's a supply glut causing price increases through holding.

Sure but you're saying doubling down is inherently risky. In this instance DCA is a greater risk because you're catching a falling knife. You didn't know you were going to be doing as much when you decided to DCA, but reasonable people also know when to stop buying.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:13:14


It does matter for purposes of timing. Think of it this way:
I have a bunch of sell orders across my accounts for a number like $750. I set my dump order to occur whenever 1 of the following exchanges reports a value over $750. My little bot monitors all the relevant exchanges and one hits 750, so my bot starts a wait cycle for the other exchanges to hit a rate that is within my sell window, and dumps all my coins across the exchanges I use. So I've now dumped all my coins across a few exchanges at the same time because the total environment is amenable to the sell order. 1 big holder can do this, or you could have a cartel of holders, or even just a bunch of people with the same idea and you get exactly the market conditions you see. All automated, completely congruent with what you're saying isn't possible.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:52:20
The only difference here is that you're using different buy in prices and quantities. 
In the first instance you have an average of 1 BTC/$600
This is from buying one at 700 and one at 500. 
In the second instance you have 1BTC/$583.33
This is from buying one at 700 and 1.4 at $500. 
The only difference here is you're buying more BTC in the second instance. The mechanics of a dollar cost average are still the exact same and in the second instance your risk is higher than the first instance, $1400 vs $1200. DCA is fixed cost purchase, which you're correct on, but saying there's some sort of huge difference here, or that it is less risky is misleading and inaccurate.

Pardon me, you heavily implied it when you referred to doubling down being risky. By your metrics, DCA would be potentially of greater risk. 


The difference in the average cost, yes, but not in the initial outlay. DCA in the hypothetical costs more in up front capital. So while your average price per coin is lower, your total cost is greater. During a market downturn, DCA is inherently riskier than a double down in terms of the hypothetical we're kicking around.

They fund the road system through gasoline tax. 


They didn't tax road usage before the gas tax because they didn't have roads to maintain. The gas tax was implemented in 1932 (at the federal level). The interstate highway started construction in '56. Federal support and funding for roads began in 1930.

First, you should learn the difference between a metaphor and an analogy. If you really mean metaphor, that means you realize that the comparison is poor and only for rhetorical effect. Calling it an analogy is giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you're not intentionally being a jackass. If you would prefer I assume you're a jackass, I can do that as well.
Second, your comparison is poor for this reason. Megaupload was a website hosting an implementation of file sharing protocol suites. Shutting down Megaupload didn't have anything to do with file sharing, it had to do with the types of files being shared. Megaupload was shut down for copyright infringement and support of piracy. It was not shut down for file sharing. 
The comparison of file sharing protocols to bitcoin is poor for the above reasons. I would assume you know this to be the case seeing as your refer to the comparison as a metaphor. Your comparison above reads as such, "bitcoin is like piracy."

Ok, but inherently one can't prove that they own a ten dollar bill, and reasonably that can be extended to Bitcoin due to the pseudonymous nature of it. For example, how would one prove whether they intended a transaction in bitcoin as opposed to someone 'taking' bitcoin from their wallet? I think reasonably, it would be just as difficult as trying to trace a cash transaction. 


Dealing with the OP's scenario I think there isn't really a legal issue here and this is why. Let's say I went to the library and left a $10 bill on the counter and left. It wouldn't be reasonable for me to assume it will still be there the next day when I come back to the library. Leaving his qbr code on the library PC is somewhat like this. 
So I think the disconnect between our points of view is the 'wallet' aspect of bitcoin. A bitcoin wallet really isn't like a physical wallet. If I left my wallet on the library counter the money inside has an identifiable owner. If I just left a wad of cash there, there's no identifiable owner. In this way, a bitcoin wallet is a lot more like a rubber band around a wad of bills as there's no true identifier tying a wallet to a person.

I say you don't know what you're talking about because DNS as implemented is for apps. Further, it is arguable decentralized. Any single server goes down, you still have thousands upon thousands of other servers to point to that hold or can retrieve the same name records. So both of these points are facile. 
Your skype naming system idea is not a current problem, nor is it even relevant to this project. The reason why redirection attacks work is because of "local ignorance". You attempt to retrieve a record, not knowing what it is, so you assume that the server name is correct and proceed. Unless the redirection site has problems or looks wrong, it's quite possible you'd never know what had occurred. How would this system address that? According to the paper, it doesn't.

Usually one can find a local dealer for personal amounts who isn't going to rob them at gun point.

No, not always. You're relying on open source for security, which means that you're depending on others in the community to find flaws you miss. If the community around the product is small, or the product goes unsupported for a month or two, holes can develop int he security of the product.

The way I look at this, it's a LE judgement call, and they'd probably say this is stealing, but only because it involves a computer. If you had dropped some cash from your pocket in the library and someone else picked it up, it wouldn't be seen as theft. Since you effectively did the same thing I don't see it as theft, but since a computer is involved, it would likely be characterized as such.

Your job, once you obtain a corn contract, is to sell the contract so you never receive any corn. So you're never dealing with corn, you're dealing with a contract.

The original question was "why are commodities exchanges regulated the way they are, and grocery stores aren't, they sell the same things. The response is "they don't sell the same things". Do try to keep up. 


And the problem here is you don't seem to understand what is sold on a commodities exchange. On a commodities exchange, you are not buying the commodity directly. Here's a better example, why is the gold trade on exchanges regulated but you can go to apmex and buy gold bars?
Because Apmex delivers the physical item, a commodities exchange does not. Do you get it now?


Bitcoin is a commodity according to several regulatory bodies. What makes you think the regs are foobar? Are you well educated enough in commodities exchange to make that determination? Based on the question and your responses, my answer would likely be no.

Ponzi is probably the wrong word, although many ponzi schemes have been run using bitcoins thus far. 
I'd probably call bitcoin a pump and dump scheme. Basically some early adopters get a community hyped up about a product, many people get into it while those early adopters sell their product for incredible gain. As time progresses the pump ends, the value falls due to the early adopters dumping their product at high price, and that group attracted to the product by the early adopters are left holding lower value or valueless items. If you track the pricing history of bitcoin, it looks like a classic pump and dump in terms of the value curve.

When you drop a vague statement, yes. It is customary to be precise when talking to someone who doesn't agree with you if you're interested in convincing them of something. You're welcome to hold me to the same standard if I say something that isn't clear to you.


Currency and commodities are stores of value. I don't disagree that it is regulated like a commodity and traded as one but you're effectively throwing out three contextual synonyms and asserting they're different things. In this instance and usage, they're not.

That's not accurate. A Tidal wave, and really all waves, are just energy traveling through a medium. The greater the energy, the more the medium is deformed. As the energy comes in, the medium (the water) will be pulled out. So before a tidal wave, you should expect to see a large draw back of the water. 
If you'd like to test and confirm, go to the beach and monitor the water recession before waves come in and compare the recession to the height of the next wave.

I want you to take a look at what you wrote, and think about how you came to this conclusion.




Yes, we don't need every device we own to mine bitcoin. That is true. You can purpose build a miner that will excel in mining bitcoin, will create more bitcoin, and won't send it to 21.co rather than to yourself. There is zero reason to buy a 21.co bitcomputer, or as I would refer to it, the 21.co wildly inefficient space heater.
@_date: 2016-05-12 11:45:14
The same reason they started issuing gift cards and the like. They want you to spend your fiat money with them. Anything they can do to get more of your fiat money, without adding to their risk, they will do.
Why do you think they decided to use a processor rather than accept bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:39:21
So you buy a bolt on GPU for the Pi and hash at 50x the speed of the ASIC on the 21.co device. It still costs far less than $400, and if you have the dev chops to want a 21.c0, you already have the chops to get the Pi setup in such a manner.

Not really. The bank was the debtor, the depositors were the creditors. The creditors were forced to 'forgive' the IOU of the bank for their deposits. Effectively the bank was given the legal ability to not honor their creditors, which is exactly what I said. You could also call this coersive bail-in, or confiscation of deposits. This is not a devaluation of the currency. It is confiscation of deposits. Very very different things. 


Ok and I also have a home loan, in which I owe 100k, negative 5% interest means despite the $50 loss in my savings account, and the benefit of having a reduced loan total, I made out. Neither action devalues the currency. 
So how does either of these two things devalue currency as you stated?

I don't understand why you won't just give us a link to these horrible interactions you're talking about. The fact you're willing to say something and not back it up with evidence is itself evidence that you're not a trustworthy source of information. You can file that statement under "reputation-based economics".
Here's the top 5 in right now:
* Clogstream bosses promised to Chinese miners that Core would block any ASIC improvements, so that their equipment would never become obsolete. Core devs now need ideas on how to do that.
* Amid controversy, Thermos suggests throwing Glorius Leader into a volcano
* Now available for bitcoin only, CIaaS: Creepshot Identification as a Service
* A devastating critique of Gavin by Bit-Coin's most respected and influential authority
* [Spammed Everywhere] We're decentralizing something (noidea what), vapor is decentralized, right?

Darknet markets are just electronic black markets. You still have just as much contact with violent or criminal elements. There's a level of disassociation, but criminals with no care for their customers are still going to sell people bad shit and be just as violent or commit just as much fraud to steal money. 


They said the same thing in the UK but it has been confirmed in their underground markets. Unfortunately their markets are pretty well connected to ours.

Simply change the word from Krokodil to meth and you can see my point. 


One of the most effective ways to follow the flow of arms and armaments is by tracing the movement of currency through arms markets. Using bitcoin removes this methodology in part due to mixing and 'coinjoin' services. You could argue that money laundering provides the same benefits to physical currency.

Participation and access. Think about why mining is done now. Why would banks or other contract entities ever want to mine cryptocurrency when they can use fiat?

The incentives are different. A bank is trying to prevent the expenditure of money on a transfer. Call it reducing losses. A miner on the bitcoin blockchain is mining to make money. Call it increasing income. The incentives are different, and the use cases are different but the underlying technology is the same.


Either you're not stating the reason why, or you're ignoring the spread of processing between institutions. I'd assume such spread would be regulated as there isn't competition to gain access to a token. All players would have incentive to reduce their supplied computing power to a level at which they're not edged out of the process, but they're not spending money needlessly and thus removing the benefit of the system.

I think you're in error here for one reason. There's a categorical difference between selling and licensing in terms of ownership. If something is sold, then it's sold.

First, we'd have to quantify what we mean by decentralized. For example, if several participants in a market are all hashing away at a chain, are they necessarily centralized because they're in the same business vertical? Decentralization can be looked at from several perspectives. Using something like a blockchain to run transactions on every PC in a bank is decentralized processing, but we wouldn't consider it a decentralized blockchain implementation because there's a central authority. 
So without describing what you mean by decentralized, we're not going to be able to do anything other than talk past each other.

I know how mesh networks function and the main problems with them, particularly in the manner you're hypothesizing, are two-fold. One, nodes aren't individually trustworthy, but if the system is robust enough the entirety of the network can be considered trustworthy. I'd be quite remiss to hand my transactions to 'Jimmy's WiFi Router and Chips' let alone to run through a network of questionably secured devices with no auditing being performed. Especially so with an irreversable transaction. Second, mesh networks suffer from major inefficiencies as there's never a locally defined routing state, and no real way to confirm or evaluate network consistency. Think internet circa 1990's, where the upstream network is only up for a few hours a night because the local switch is offline during the day.

There's nothing easy about using bitcoin compared to traditional payment cards. There's nothing that adds value when transacting in bitcoin. None of the things you've asserted here are true.

If teenagers are having difficulties using their various traditional methods to get games, how are they having an easier time using traditional methods to get bitcoins to get games?

There's a difference between being 'entirely useless' within a specific context, vs being 'entirely useless' in general. That being said, at no point in time did I say encryption was 'entirely useless' in general. Read what's written without reading into what's written.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:22:16
After a short bit of reading, I can see both have occurred, however, I'm not solid on why you think this would devalue a currency. 
A bail-in is a write-off or restructuring of short term debt. Typically a creditor will accept this instead of a liquidation event as at liquidation they'll receive pennies on their dollar as opposed to simply delaying or reducing the total debt owed by an acceptable amount.
Negative interest rates don't devalue currency, but take a piece out of someone's holdings, which isn't an issue if people spend rather than hoard, which through spending strengthens the economy. 
Can you elaborate?

I don't see how this makes the coins necessary. You spend the same amount of power and energy writing transactions with or without a token of value. The coin doesn't secure the network. It's a reward for participating in the network. If you have some other form of incentivizing participants, (like requiring you to put X amount of processing into the network to participate) then the coin has no utility. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:58:11


I'm not so sure I have made your point for you. All CC processing is done in basically the same way. As you say, your security is your account number. If stolen and used, your recourse is a chargeback, regardless of the transaction type. 
With Bitcoin this is less of a concern due to private keys, unless your bitcoin is stolen or locked up in a transaction. Various vectors for theft would be infiltration of your computer (which is a leading method of theft for credit card, bitcoin, and identity), theft of a physical wallet (less common today in the credit card world, probably not too common in Bitcoin either), and probably a few more. 


An electronic currency that works like cash is going to be a really hard sell in the world of purchase protection. Half the reason why people like credit and debit cards is that protection. Physical cash is going away because of the problems inherent in cash. I don't see an e-cash making much headway when the competing methodologies offer greater safeguards of wealth.

Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralized due to large mining pools, but it's much better than something controlled by a bank or any other single company.
And something like an inter-bank blockchain for asset transfer would satisfy your criteria for decentralization. To participate, you must hash on the chain, if you don't participate, you're out of the network and have to use a more costly method of transfer. Viola, incentive without tokenization. Technically permissionless as to participate, you're required to participate.

Stability would be big. The price has become more stable and we've seen an increase in adoption as a result. Transaction scaling is probably the necessary next step. What form that scaling takes doesn't really concern me (lightning, bigger blocks, smaller blocks, whatever else). It's really hard to get more people to use something if the lag time for results of said use can extend into hours or days. After functionality is hammered out, usability would be next. Simply put, if the system isn't as easy or easier to use than existing systems, the majority of people are just not going to use it.

To compete with an entrenched contender you have to be a better fit, or at least look like one. Right now I think Bitcoin adoption is hampered by the feature set. For example: chargebacks. Chargeback is an annoying but necessary part of the customer-vendor relationship. Bitcoin has no such mechanism. Unfortunately this is a problem for adoption as consumers aren't going to voluntarily flip to a system that provides them less consumer protection. Having a broader base in which one can spend the currency is helpful, but that impact is drastically reduced if the entrenched systems already have access and provide better utility. If traditional currencies were really shitty and hard to use, Bitcoin would be doing significantly better than it is currently.

So you're suggesting that they'd get paid in bitcoins for their day job...


If you have a mailing address, you can simply drop them in an envelope. They're gift cards, not credit cards, and not tied to a single user. Seems like a very weak use case though.


And? 


Right, so your $500 turns into less than $500 in BTC but not in Visa based on the number of transactions you perform. That sucks. You, as the user, are paying to use your own money above and beyond the built in price modifications to account for vendor paid transaction costs. 


Simple typo.


A 4 day delay, and you need a bank account to get it. Kinda contrary to what you're touting as a benefit to bitcoin. You require a bank for the unbanked to buy bitcoin at this rate with this site...


So they won't be going to coinbase. 


But who's paying that? Total cost would be $3 for the Visa card. There's no 1.5% kicker to the customer. Amazon pays that. Using BTC, the user pays that .05 for the transaction. 


For my locality, the markups are on the order of 7-20% for the majority of offers. This is also assuming you don't use one of their ATMs. 


You're using a very odd definition of savings. 


Aside from darknet markets, or cross border remittance I don't see a use case that beats cash and the latter only marginally beats it.

Disagreement. The value and utility of Bitcoin isn't substantially helped or harmed by having Bitpay do bitcoin processing for Valve. You can already get a shift card. You can already spend your bitcoin with Valve through several other mechanisms. I don't see this as any sort of help for bitcoin, and thus far the bitcoin markets agree. Now if Valve discontinues bitcoin processing, that will hurt the ecosystem, just as other companies dropping acceptance have hurt the ecosystem. I don't see Valve accepting bitcoin via a processor to be helpful, but there are a lot of ways this integration could hurt the ecosystem down the road.

Which security mechanism specifically? You have a fully functional network that has multiple security flaws currently. How would this be better? Further, with no internet, you're looking at a greatly reduced transaction processing rate, which is my point. Currently your transaction has literally millions of processors over millions of paths. In a mesh scenario you're potentially looking at single points of failure, meaning drastic delays in processing, where everyone can count good ole cash. 


That's not how this works. On a mesh network you're going to broadcast looking for the next node, once you get a response back, you're going to route that data from your network, to the next node. The routing states are malleable but there is still routing. A broadcast-only network would flood out nodes and not function in the way you're thinking. 


Eh, that's BBS. There wasn't a 'network' for Usenet. It was effectively a distributed forum but it would not work for the purposes you're describing. Think clearly on this one. Usenet was accessed by you dialing into a server that would periodically dial into (or in rare cases use a state of the art 76k digital subscriber line) to replicate local posts globally. It would be days before you got the latest thread updates in some cases. This changed pretty rapidly once interconnection became more common, but if you think BTC will run like Usenet, then you're off a bit. 


No, broadcast is used in all networking very often today. Broadcast based networks are bad for many reasons, one of which is broadcast storms. Another issue, more crippling for things like BTC where time to transaction matters, is the potentially huge delays when any sort of volume is coming from multiple sources. BTC would be useless without a solid network infrastructure simply due to the fact that without rapid communication, BTCs current problems become exponentially worse.

Little weird that you'd want privacy for a currency transaction and public votes using the same medium. If anything bitcoin and public blockchain voting would be a strong combi-tool for subverting democracy.

I do, in some cases they wouldn't have a choice, ie: variable interest loans issued prior to the interest rate change.


Yes, it is to encourage spending, just as negative interest rates on loans would encourage spending, and spending is what drives economic growth. Holding and saving stifle economic growth.

But a negative interest rate is the opposite of QE. QE adds money to the economy, negative interest removes money from the economy. 


Demonstrably false.


That's not what a bail-in is from what I've read. A bail-in is the logical opposite of a bail-out. Example:
You are a company, I am a lender. I bail you out by loaning you money with little to no interest and a long enough lead time for your business to stabilize. 
You are a company that owes me money due at the end of the quarter. You cannot pay your short term debt to me. So either I decide to forget about the short term debt you owe, or we restructure the debt in such a way that you can pay me later than the end of the quarter without going further into debt. 


That really depends. A negative interest rate of 1% compounded annually would mean I borrow 100k from the bank due at the end of the year. At the end of the year I owe 1% less than the total amount due to the bank. Who's stealing from me in that instance?
The only people who get shafted during negative interest rate periods would be people who hold and hoard.

Digital signatures don't do much to protect you from the whole host of other security issues you'll run into with no internet. Think of all the types of attack that are considered unfeasible today that wouldn't be so difficult in a reduced network capacity world. 


Are you agreeing with the detriments I mentioned as well? your statement here is a little unclear to me. 


Either we're hitting a disagreement in usage due to network jargon (I'm in the field) or you're referring to something I'm unaware of. A broadcast is a call out to every port with no specific address. It's used for things like DHCP and some older noisier protocols. TCP isn't traditionally considered 'broadcast' in this way aside from arp requests. 


Ok, so do you see the problem with doing this on a mesh network? 


Maybe not. The problem here would be access during these broadcasts. On any local network the number of machines that can concurrently talk (assuming no bridging) is 1. You're going to have packet death and shit tons of noise trying to run a payment system via broadcast on a mesh network. And forget about trying to get a full node up and running considering the necessary download to ensure the node is in sync. Already people are experiencing huge issues trying to get their full node running due to blockchain download. There may be some artful ways around this but just imagine trying to do so when you're running via an emergent mesh network with strangers. 


You're assuming there will be lots of local nodes in this mesh. That's a really bad assumption. 


No, it really isn't. What's your practical experience with mesh networks if I might ask? It sounds like you're knowledgable on how they function, but I'm not sure you've ever run one, or at least haven't done so recently. 


Bitcoin would be drastically affected. Think of the delays in processing a transaction caused by 'stress tests' now. Imagine that was your baseline for use of Bitcoin as a single user, and it only got exponentially worse for each user added to the system. Bitcoin would be utterly useless in an internet less scenario. I'm not shooting from the hip saying this, it's been tried with a similar technology. Are you familiar with the various white papers around  e-mail certification via tokenized blockchain? You're going to run into exactly the same problems over a mesh using modern equipment. 


This isn't true. It's about the scale of the data. The more data you need, the more fucked you are on mesh, especially for stateless protocols as things like packet order are key for voice and streaming audio/video. Traditional web surfing might be tricky due to DNS inconsistency and server hop distance over mesh, but that's addressable in part. 


No, I'm thinking all networks. 


But Bitcoin isn't the entirety of the network. You have two types of mesh network. If you're going to build an ad hoc via cell phones, every device will broadcast every packet. It's called 'flooding'. Unless you're building a consistent network, where you're going to deploy something like SPB, you're going to bring that network right the fuck down as soon as the blockchain starts syncing from node to node. 


And how exactly do you think you identify your neighbor in a mesh network? 


That's not how a mesh network functions, further, there's going to be a lot more in those packets than just bitcoin blocks. Every packet will contain "forward this packet to X" if you're communicating to X. 


But while it is traveling from A to X you're going to be waiting on communication between every other node to stop or pause so you can get a packet in. Plus you're dealing with the fact everything is running on a MANET, so you're talking potentially minutes just to get a "are you there X?" packet out.

They seem to value it just fine when I stop at any store available. That being said, none of those same stores value bitcoin at all. So I'm not so sure this is a strong argument.

Even this isn't really accurate. 


The types of transaction most certainly play into this comparison. 


Physical cash certainly can't be used directly online, but there is no such barrier preventing an electronic cash-like system from being used in such a manner. As Bitcoin is not useful for mundane transactions. You could argue it is akin to gold, but it is certainly not like cash.

By your own admission in these threads, you did not confirm that the money was cleared through something as straightforward as a phone call to the bank. You misread their website and in return sent BTC to a scammer based on your trust int he words of the scammer.
