Many will never get past stage 1 or stage 2. 
At least, until their wages are paid in Bitcoin.

This is a marketplace, a fee marketplace. Everyone ought to know:
1) Just remember that Bitcoin confirmation time is considered clearing time. 
Settlement on the bitcoin protocol is 10 minutes. (Compared to visa, which settles in 30 Days.)
Transaction propagation on the network is near instantaneous. Unless you are dealing in large transactions that need some security against fraud, do we really need to wait for transactions to clear? 
Merchants should see the transaction being made on their point-of-sale. If you are not in a hurry to see your txt in the next block, use a smaller fee.
2) You can set your own fees. When using third party wallets, you are NOT using Bitcoin. You are using a custodial exchange, and they may dictate your fees or decide to delay your transaction for their own reasons. 
If you want control of your funds, you need to use your own decentralized wallet. Use mycelium or the the native Bitcoin Wallet on your node and you can set the fee. 
3) The fee market will balance itself, if we make the choice ourselves to set our own fees for our own needs. Most will not want to use more then 200sat/b, and that will reflect in the market as average fees will drop to a more steady average. 
TL;DR : Set your own fees by using native, decentralized wallets and the fee-market will take care of itself.

I’m afraid this is what all the banks say and think when they praise “blockchain technology.”

I’m not too concerned. Keep in mind buying or selling futures takes up capital. It becomes an opportunity cost to these funds, as it ties up capital. And since bitcoin is a deflationary currency with a cap on its supply, every future for bitcoin gets more and more expensive. 
Someone needs to hold the coins for the future’s delivery date. If they are cash settled, then God’s speed to those selling the futures. The price might run away from them real quick.

Also, if you find you can’t change your tx fees from your chosen wallet, find a better wallet. Some of the wallets providers out there will automatically set fees for the fastest confirmations and that means stupid high fees when the mempool is clogged up.
