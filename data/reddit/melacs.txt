I think it will continue on the path it is now. Not yet fully mainstream but also not completely forgotten. Price will be around 1500. Regulations will make it difficult to use, but it will fly under the radar and be used by let us say about 8 million people. Just a guess though

1. Easy to understand 'idiot safe' service for the use of bitcoin. (online wallet) (either buy or copy/create one of the existing services)
2. Allow adsense or other payments to be sent in bitcoins. (I gave up on the whole check thing long ago) Preferably with a tax service that automatically takes off the correct portion in fiat currency. The tax thing is important.
3. Start mining (Unless Ghash = google hash in which case stay below 40%) in order to provide some security to the network.
4. Work (send some help to) with the bitcoin developers to improve on some issues that need to be solved. OPEN SOURCE 
5. Make a business owner wallet service so it is easy for businesses to accept bitcoin. Think paypal, but lose the crazy fees.
6. Help, buy a company or design a hardware wallet and provide it cheaply to the audience or incorporate in android devices. (Long term vision)
7. Don't be evil and try to bleed or cage the beast, there are enough altcoins to switch to. If you reject outside google innovations, trouble will follow. Try to integrate.
8. Find out what governments think before releasing the whole stuff. The last thing we need is a great service that suddenly becomes banned.
9. Hoard some bitcoins prior to big press releases and push them onto the market when the bubble is obviously going to become a catastrophe.
10. I look forward to being able to split the bill in bitcoin automatically between people after a party. Tax free shopping in bitcoin. ATM's that work bitcoin both ways at the airport(obviously with limits). Vending machines that take bitcoin and so on.

Actually I know of some banks that have two factor authentication. (not on the credit card itself though).
If you know anyone who works for a bank, then you will know the real problem:
Sheer incompetence. Banks make huge amounts of money and instead of running a tight ship, they are a leaky crack vessel. They are burdened with regulations and old customs. 
This is made worse by the fact that the bank's customers include large amounts of idiots, who will get hacked no matter how nice the system. 
If banks are the evil corporations you think them to be, then the analogy is here that their employees are about as effective as the average James Bond's adversary.

MT Gox collapse was on the news here and the Japanese seem to know what is going on. (Even the media) The problem is that the case doesn't have any precedent. The company failed and the assets will be liquidated and will be divided amongst the stakeholders. Because there is no precedent, it will be difficult to decide what to do with people who held bitcoin before the collapse. Should the fiat holders get priority or should it be equally divided and at what price? 
Japanese laws in this aspect are usually contradictory. It can go either way depending on the judge. This is how the system works (for example: gambling is illegal, but pachinko is legal until there is trouble and the police can always close them down under the gambling law). 
Not knowing what to do, it takes a long time, or they are stalling to try and figure it out. Most likely they are looking for the easiest way with the least public media problems and blame. 
Knowing Japan, I would guess the big shrimp will get most of the leftovers, especially the big Japanese shrimp. At the moment they are trying still trying to find out who owns what .
Ironically bitcoin would be the easiest way to reimburse people all around the world, but my gamble would be on the Japanese contacting you with an official letter and a couple of expensive payment methods. Including picking it up in person.

I'm not an expert on these things, but history tells us. Never trust the first version of a mechanical device. I guess people will test it and then version 2 will be available for both bitcoin online and let's say on amazon or ebay. You have to imagine that people will first want the trezor and then the bitcoins instead of the other way around.
Maybe selling trezors with bitcoins preloaded could be a thing and then ways to recharge them easily at ATM's and so on.
This is just dreaming though and it will take some failure if it gets to that. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:43:06
Are the other ATM's also using a printer that prints openly visible QR codes? I guess for now it wouldn't matter, but as these become more prominent, a simple camera or skimmer could copy the QR's and steal the coins. If the QR code is used immediately it isn't a problem, but still. 
Maybe a folding device that folds or knits the QR code together could prevent this?

Well since google searches are personalized I can't prove anything. (I did say seems which implied an impression). Even if we search for the same thing, the results might be different based on previous searches. 
I just had the impression that the negative news about bitcoin usually appears on the top of the bitcoin news section while the positive stories seem to follow. I agree that it is possible that the negative stories are always more recent and more popular or more guided at me by their algorithm. If so, then I will retract my statement.

We always see bitcoin as the original and these companies as worse copies. The truth is that apple or another company might think of something great and then promote it. (especially hardware) When that happens, someone will copy it for bitcoin and it will be free or with lower fees. This is why these tech companies that focus on profit are dancing around not sure what to do.

Sorry, yeah I didn't really pay much attention. To be honest, the website is a little bit confusing. Basically yes and no are the same question. If you have less than 50% yes it means you think no and vice versa.
Anyway: 
21.28 / 1.270	 No 
For all it's worth, I would think that it wasn't an inside job. If it was then I expect the Japanese authorities to find out. Since they didn't it is most likely a hacker who might be somewhere sitting on a huge stack of coins. The real question is: who is cashing out bitcoins on a massive scale?
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:29:05
The last time bitcoin was on mainstream television they looked at from the following perspective:
-It is useful for unstable countries
-It is a risky investment (That might pay off)
Please note that Japan already has IC train cards that can be (re)charged with cash at any train station or in any bus. The recognition is instant and it can be used to pay for transport, vending machines, stores in train stations and some department stores. For the moment these cards cost about 50 dollar and come charged with 30 dollar. You can accrue points and get discount from that. 
I believe bitcoin has many uses, but for the moment I don't really see why a Japanese merchant would go for bitcoin rather than for IC card technology except for the novelty of it. Japan has known very little inflation (up until recently) and that makes the Japanese people very fond of their yen.
I think Japan might finally accept bitcoin if it becomes more known for its store of value, international use, when its payment system is perfected and so on. This will take a while. The Japanese are very careful investors and they are also a little bit chauvinistic investors as well. Despite Satoshi Nakamoto being of Japanese descent (wild speculation on my part), the currency looks very foreign to them in terms of use.

Fiats are very susceptible to a so called hyper-inflation trap that makes the currency worth close to nothing. Weimar 1921, never forget. (By November 1923, the American dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German marks source: wikipedia)

To be honest, I'm sure there are other factors such as average wages, server prices, orientation (for shipping), language and so on that should be on your list.

It seems like a case of: What do we do if a Belgian exchange or company goxes tomorrow?
The good thing for the Belgians is: there is legal base for being scammed out of coins/money by a company (if it is Belgian).

I wonder if there are some opportunities here. 
Step one: buy bitcoins from a Belgian. Bitcoin goes up in value = profit. Bitcoin goes down in value: sue and recover money.

Ebay could be a huge boost in the sense that people could sell their stuff (relatively easily) and get bitcoin in return. It would solve the earning-spending imbalance that bitcoin currently has (easy to spend, harder to get). I think the coolest thing paypal could do is to include a conversion/payout in bitcoin tool. This would mean that even though the buyers pay in fiat, the sellers could get their hands on coins. If then ebay came up with its own marketplace for bitcoin products, it would change the whole system. The problem is that paypal would in the end render itself obsolete. (it could convert to being a crypto exchange-bank like institution though)

From what I read below, student housing is most likely the reason. Lots of people on the same network/internet connection is bait for a crook trying to get into personal info. Then when the hacker found out about your activity on Blockchain, he or she knew you might have coins. This invites him or her to try and infect your computer/get into your room to steal your coin. 
I'm very sorry about your coins. I guess you could try and track them and see if the thief is stupid enough to cash them out in a way that reveals his or her identity. 
Try and look for someone close to you. Did you talk about bitcoin with someone recently? How many people in your building that know about bitcoin? 
tl;dr the thief might be in your building

To be honest, I am not vested and not informed very well about this company, but I will give my opinion anyway.
It seems like you have good intentions (for now), but you do not have the patience to pull things of. I understand that you are trying to compete with other players, but professionalism is the key here. Launching a beta-style product is good for learning, but do you really want to learn while your customers lose confidence?
Start with one core service and make sure it works well, is easy to use and that you can communicate if there are any problems. (would it not be better to have the option of a customer enter a deposit address where the coins are sent automatically in case of inactivity?)
tl;dr Try to do things professionally and without mistakes. Don't overextend on new services. Try to think of the customer first.
Good luck!

Is there any chance your private key was compromised before you started to use the two factor authentication or other security? If a person gathers private keys, they might wait for the right moment to strike. When the wallet has been dormant and the owner might not be checking up on it every day.

I'm not an expert in this, but it would be possible to create a transaction and broadcast it once you have internet. The problem here is that double spending becomes possible. Until the transaction is included in a block, the coins are still in the original wallet.

Bitcoin is not really stable at the moment either and it seems to be going down. It might not be a bad investment for them, but it would take some convincing at least.

If you are trying to persuade your father to invest his money in bitcoin, think again. Just do with your own resources what you think is right.

Think a little bit more logical like a poor Argentinian shopkeeper. You sell some and need to buy from a supplier the next day. If bitcoin drops 2 percent, you lose 2 percent. You don't have the option of holding or hoping for the future, you have a business to run. (instant dollar conversion is not an option). The reason they don't want pesos is because of the price change and in the short run, bitcoin does change a lot as well.
Finally: if you believe in it so much, book a plane ticket to Argentina and try to sell them some of your bitcoins. Sometimes it is important to know where you stand. It is good to dream of the future, but you have to remain logical.

I concur with most suggestions here:
-cash-based (credit card use is on the rise though)
-introverted (Most (not all) Japanese people buy Japanese stock, use Japanese banks, spend their money in Japan and so on)
-No strong inflation (except for housing, your fiat will buy you the same things as it did years ago)
-Limited English skills (Very little wallets and main sites are translated in Japanese so far. Lots of Japanese understand English, but trusting it with your money is different)
-Limited IT skills (Not everyone, but quite a lot of Japanese are not very good at using computers, let alone be able to get bitcoins)
-Conservative attitude on money (Japanese banks were spared a deal of the financial crisis because they lagged behind on the foreign constructions that caused the crisis)
-Media attention is close to 0 (NHK did a report and it was in the news once, but that was all)

Security has many methods and many levels:
-One level would be the continuous screening of employees (and families/acquaintances) This is done by casino's and it is very effective to make sure cases are rare. 
-The second level is to limit the access of employees to the funds. (This is where you have the problem)
-The third level is the surveillance. (always be on the watch-out for things out of the ordinary and log all actions) Part of your surveillance should be open (to scare) and part closed (to catch). Never have one person design your whole system.
-The fourth level is change. (If possible try to change employees around in random fashion, change equipment regularly, change rules and so on. Habit is your enemy)
-The fifth level is respect/challenge/satisfaction. (rewarding employees for pointing out flaws, respecting them, give them what challenges they want (if necessary hire a psychologist)) This may seem crazy, but could be more important than you thought. The check-ups are also part a deterrent.
-The sixth level would be a blind-method. Basically having a copy of operations around and the programmer not knowing if they are working on the real deal or a fake simulation. Screw up on the fake and you are out.
As for detailed methods, I can't help you since you didn't post specifics. I would suggest a log of all transactions within your system on the blockchain. If the operation can be suspended,  then do so as soon as a single satoshi leaves to an address that is not in your system: put all your employees in a room until you figure it out. (yes, this can be tampered with, but you don't tell them you are tracking the blockchain with all the addresses) This won't prevent people who just want to destroy your business or single people who are taking the fall for someone else.
There are other levels, but this should get you started. 
You already seem to be on par with the first rule: always expect.

Looking at the article and reading between the lines it would seem that they will try and test maybe two things:
Overseas testing: (Think Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam) It would be a smart way to organize remittances through subsidiaries of Rakuten or in those countries and Japan. It is important to note that a lot of Japanese banks (except for a few) use the bigger banks like Mitsubishi UFJ to transfer to and receive money from abroad (it sounds crazy but it's true). This is why they can't just lower their fees. Using bitcoin they could cut this middle man out and just use bitcoin as a way to balance their accounts. 
The second part would be Japanese vendors could sell to countries like Nigeria without having the trouble of credit card withdrawals. The buyer pays and Rakuten has a contract with the seller and Rakuten ships the goods(not the seller). This means the buyer is secured by Rakuten and the seller is secured by the non-refundable bitcoin transaction. 
tl;dr There is an opportunity in remittances and in dealing with countries that are not trustworthy.
(Too bad I couldn't pass the interview stage of the Rakuten recruiting system)

I got the impression that before the bubble, the price was going up slowly and people got excited by just that. The price hike fed on this initial excitement and people lost their minds.
 The bubble was actually annoying as well as exciting for me. I had preferred a steady rise over time. I remember people arguing whether it was a bubble or just 'to the moon'. Obviously it was a bubble, but since people didn't know when it would burst it still didn't mean that they shouldn't step in.

Judging by the comments and your initial question, it would be feasible to look at bitcoins as some sort of giftcards in a foreign currency at the moment. The currency can fluctuate and the store will need to convert it to use it. However, as these giftcards are accepted at more and more places, their usefulness will increase. In the future, the stores might start pricing in the 'foreign' currency that is bitcoin. As stated before, bitcoin needs to become more stable for that.

I am not an expert, but isn't the volume of the other exchanges the total volume traded both ways? If I trade the same 100 BTC to fiat and back 4 times, the volume is 400BTC. A lot of traders like to make money so they buy and sell a lot. Willy, however, only bought and then reached into his fake pockets and bought more and more and more. 
Then other people and the media jumped on it and it created the bubble. The bubble created more fuss and bitcoin evolved and that is why we come out of the bubble better than before.

It is typical for those who oppose a technology or a group of innovators to classify them as a group of 'dangerous ***-ists'. Only in rising above these classifications can something truly succeed. If only feminists or libertarians or Americans or techies or anarchists use bitcoin, it will never become a disruptive technology. If it can speak to all of those groups and more, bitcoin has a chance. Future will tell. Certainly it would be sad if people were too scared by their convictions to try out a technology.

I have a question. (maybe a stupid one) I just wonder why I cannot pay in fiat to rent a miner/contract. I understand that buying bitcoin directly is more profitable, but I support the network through this method. Is it because of taxes? 
With exchanges in some countries being so unstable, I can see why (if Ghash takes credit cards) would get a lot of customers.

Please note that paypal payments can be reversed and disputed. This was a common ebay scam back in the days. Once the thief got the coins, he or she disputed the payment and got the transaction reversed. Paypal sided with the buyer since selling bitcoins was dodgy. Lots of bitcoins were stolen this way. Please notify your users that paypal is at their own high risk.
Are you planning to promote it? Unless this is commonly used, it will be hard to find people using it in the same area and this app will basically die a silent death.

I highly doubt Gox had the coins to begin with. Exchanges run out of coins or cash. Gox never had this problem even with the huge price spike. This would suggest that they somehow created fictive coins/cash to meet the need, hoping to wing it all the while gathering fees. When a 'bank run' happened and people started withdrawing, the whole system collapsed, just like a bank would.

Circle has sent out a decent amount of invites. People are getting free coins to spend. The statement does say, however that if the 10 dollar offer can be retracted at any time. This basically means that it is safer to spend the coins on something.
This would explain the higher volume this week (and possibly the price drop if stores that convert to fiat are used)

The only way you can get a bubble is by having lots of people buy lots of coins (obviously). The problem is the lack of trustworthy and accessible exchanges prevents this. When ATM's are widespread a hardware wallet is done well and a reliable and easy to use exchange is present we can have another run.

Unlikely as it may seem, people get into car accidents and lose their memory (partially). A brain wallet is not 100% foolproof. I understand that if you lose your memory you might even forget you had bitcoins in the first place. In any case, nothing will be 100% but there are indeed different levels of security. 
In the end remember that it is just money. It is interesting how many people are paranoid about their savings, but will not wear a helmet, will not be careful in traffic, fail to eat healthily, don't exercise and so on.

I'll try to answer (This does not mean I Identify as a statist). 
Extreme libertarians have the tendency to underestimate the sheer and utter stupidity of a huge amount of the population.
To a well educated person such as yourself it might seem absurd that some people would be so incredibly stupid, but they are. Every day millions of people spend money on snake oil salesmen. I don't disagree that governments are not doing a very good job at stopping them, but at least they make sure the snake oil isn't poisonous. 
The same goes for bitcoin. I think it is fantastic to well educated careful people, but it isn't for the general public because it is not idiot proof. You need hardware or some foolproof easy to use wallet before you can even let the general public touch it.
Governments don't control the money supply now, central banks do. This means that governments actually wouldn't/shouldn't really care if they use fiat or cryptocurrency. It would be cheaper, easier to regulate, international and so on. Governments would have to be more careful about how much they spend, which would be a good thing. I don't have time to think of all the implications, so I'll cut this short and leave you with this. I'll try to answer further questions, but please keep it civil.

I wonder how much the miners are affecting the price. After all they have similar electricity costs every month. This means if the price goes lower, they have to sell more (reserve) coins to pay their electricity. This leads to the price spiraling down. (as well as traders who jump in on it) As the price goes down, the volume that gets pumped into the market by miners goes down (relatively). This means the market starts to play a bigger role. The market grows and the price starts going up. Price goes up and miners get more influence and so on and so on.

Coinmap shows 1968 bitcoin places and 97 litecoin. This is about 1/20 ratio. I think shops are less concerned about which coin is used than people think.

You are right about the sudden shift in wealth. The good thing about Bitcoin is that it doesn't gather interest. The wealth itself doesn't make more wealth. This means that if bitcoin stabilizes, then if you hoard your bitcoin, you will get nothing extra for it. This is very different from having a million dollars on a bank/in stock. In a sense it seems more equal.

Given the amount of wallets that actually hold bitcoin, we are looking at a population such as Jamaica. So if the business doesn't have any customers from countries which such a population regularly, don't expect many extra bitcoin sales. Even if you promote your business directly in say Jamaica, the service will be quite limited. The advantage is that accepting bitcoin requires little investment and it can only grow.

Here is what most likely happened. Person A (the criminal) hacks a bank account of person B (victim). Person A buys the bitcoin from you and transfers money from the victim's bank account to you. You give A the bitcoin. The victim sees the account drained and complains to the bank. The bank reverses the payment/freezes the funds. If you reverse all the fraudulent activities, person B gets the money back, you get your bitcoins back and person A gets nothing. Your best course of action would be to try and find person A. Tell the bank to do so and try to look yourself.

I wonder how are you planning to break the news to your customers that they have to buy cryptocoins and send them to you?

The problem with your logic is that what 'backs' the fiat's security is also empty promises. The government backs fiat. The army is paid with the same fiat, they can print the same fiat. Once the inflation starts, everything will be worthless and the new government will print a new type of money. Thus fiat is not backed by governments, but by the promises of and the belief in governments. You can believe in bitcoin just as much as you can in a government. The good part about bitcoin is that as long as people accept it, its value holds. There is no need to trust your corrupt government and banking system as well. 
Bitcoin is global. 
Gold is indeed a great store of value (in physical form), but it is not a currency. It is bulky, hard to split up and divide, not easy to check if fake or not and so on. It cannot be used over the internet. This means that the only competition is fiat.
Because bitcoin is limited, in time it will make sense for people to accept bitcoin for a business, without considering the exchange rate. At that time, bitcoin will be backed by whatever business provides whatever service for a certain amount of bitcoins. If the services are global, then it will be difficult to destabilize.

Usually in that case the dealer will be caught when he or she spends the money legally. Buy a ferrari: The IRS (or other tax body) says: "Hey, where did you get the money for the ferrari?" Then the dealer says bitcoin. Then they say:"well let's look at your transactions, shall we?" They track the money back through the blockchain and exchange and realize that it is bought recently. They ask:"So where did you get the money to buy these coins in the first place?" =&gt; busted. 
If the dealer pays taxes and uses a fake internet service that accepts bitcoin, it would be a smokescreen, but still the sales  records for the company and so on need to be in order. Basically this could be done with cash also, so the bitcoin don't really help much.

You are absolutely right. It has value because people trust the protocol and not because they 'believe'.

Could be a Ponzi, could be a collect and run. That being said, the interest rates are lower than many investment returns (especially in China). The risk for this venture is the volatility of bitcoin. 
Couldn't the blockchain tell us if the transactions are performed in a loop? People being repaid with their own money?
