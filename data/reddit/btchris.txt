The bot is only running for about 2 days now. While it finds also "older" nodes, i am not sure, how many are not found. I guess we have to wait a bit more to get more accurate numbers for the longer timeframes.

I got the message first, too. Just go to Account -&gt; "Connect your bank account and credit cards to Circle." worked for me

i just put the note in my ad. and actually 5 more notes.... the last one is, that they have to message me, that they have read my terms of trade.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:44:05
This is just the message i got and i was under the impression that everyone gets this message.

I asked them about it. This is their answer:
"It's great that you're interested in SEPA transfers. We're looking to implement it this year."
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:58:52
Nice design.
Do you offer SEPA desposit/withdraw?
