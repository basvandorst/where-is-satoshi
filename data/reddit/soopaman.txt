This. Telling them they won't do business with people who sell drugs sounded very derogatory.

It's totally fine if they want to make this decision. The wording the response was derogatory and implied that recreational marijuana dispensaries are the equivalent of a thug slinging coke on the street corner: "... we don't offer our services to businesses that sell drugs."
More professional would be: "Because of risks in the legality of marijuana between state and federal level, it's in our financial interest not to offer services to marijuana institutions at this time." 
See the difference?

I don't think it's worth it to try this on Coinbase if for no other reason than the high 1% transaction fee. It's much easier to secure profits on an actual exchange with lower transaction costs, like Bitstamp which is 0.2%. 
If you don't want to send bitstamp your fiat and wait for the deposit, just send bitcoins to your bitstamp account. Day trade all you want and when you want to get your money out, send it in BTC to coinbase and sell it to them.

Yes, this. I use the same pool and mine with my GTX-460 that I've had for a few years. Electricity is free and I'm slowly generating some bitcoin. I usually get about 0.0015btc a day.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. That's a pretty good move right now and you will very likely be able to buy in much cheaper in the next couple of days.

That happened to me at $400 right before the big ramp up in mid-November. I did a small buy just to test the process and see how long it took, and I was very upset that I was locked out of buying for a week. The price ended up in the 700's by the time I was able to buy again.

If you invest with dollar/cost averaging now in this downtrend and end up paying, for convenience sake $750/btc, and we resume an uptrend (which is the only way this is going to go if the bitcoin experiment works and we continue to see a rise in adoption) and we end up back at our ATH, or even $1100, you've made a significant gain. Is it 10x yields like the early folks? Hell no. But 70-80% returns is nothing to scoff at. 
We all say don't invest anything you can't lose. It can go to zero if it fails, but I don't think it's just going to stagnate here and never go up.

Good job giving him a decision instead of forcing the Bitcoin on him.

Dogecoin, seriously?
No one is going to take the community seriously if that kind of alt-currency gets adopted.

Why not use 90-95% for child support now, as suggested, and the rest as speculative investment for the child's college tuition? The speculative investment doesn't have to be for the mother.

Millionaire dreams aside, it's not too late to invest and see significant yields.

I had trouble getting verified. I've just now gotten verified on Bitstamp.

I woke up this morning at 6am and checked and saw it was down to $925, having just bounced off the bottom at ~$860 decided to go ahead and buy 0.4 since I was still sore about watching the bounce and not buying on Sunday. Glad I bought today since the price was back up over $1000 by the time I left the house.

Don't worry, nobody believes him.

You'd give $400-600 donation to a video game contest? 
It's great to promote bitcoin but I think there's better charities to donate to and improve bitcoin's image.
Unless of course you're regularly donating that amount of coinage to charities anyhow, in which case I say carry on then.

Eventually, if the experiment succeeds. 
I'm going to support it as best as I can, and buy stuff with BTC (if the stuff I want can be bought with it), but if it starts to drop in price and I can take profits, I'm going home with them. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:42:26
Of course he did.

Please do!

1 in 25 chance of being in a spot, multiplied by 1/25 chance the next time. Theoretically (unless I fail at a probability), you have a 1/625 chance of having the mine in the same square as last round.
Playing that way doesn't actually work out though. I had a good streak at one point (tripled my money [$1-&gt;$3]) and cashed out. Played again later with $2, and tried the same strategy and I had several games (6/10 or so) that ended up with the mine in the same spot. It's statistically improbable, but there it was. Might be "less than random" in my opinion.
As karelb said, the only way to win is to not play. 
The way to lose the least is by what Ilsensine said, pick one and cash out. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:19:13
And in two days that might very well have been 100 BTC. 
Good luck and I hope it works out for you.

I like this attitude.

@_date: 2013-12-13 22:32:01
Really, was thinking similarly. I highly doubt we'll see huge investments or even start pushing the ATH until after January first. I don't know how much selling off will happen, or for how long, but I believe it will happen and the first few days of January may be our last chance to pick up "cheap" coins.
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:19:47
Generally, no, but I've made a little bit of money with some casual gambling. The thing is to not get emotionally attached to your money or try to win big. 
I put in a certain amount and no more. I have a goal to "win" and will play with that amount until I reach the goal, at which point I quit gambling and cash out. 
If you lose all the money before that happens, quit and take solace in the fact you had fun and realize that you can't get your money back by gambling more.

I'm on middlecoin and have made more the last couple of days than I did all the prior week.

You're missing the magic crystal ball that predicts the future. That's the only way it would be "easy."
I think if you started trying to daytrade with your $20, you'd get a feel for what it's like. Maybe you'll luck out, but it's a gamble. 
At least with $20 you don't have much to lose.

As much as you can, and should change wallets, this is the last thing I want tattoed on me. 
Okay maybe not last thing. I'd rather have this than a tattoo of a dick on my back.

He was given a choice between that and cash.

I don't quite get how to do this. Maybe because I've never made a brain wallet?
After I get the answer, how would I take the money? I see how to verify the answer to public key.

Just contact them.
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to be getting some btc I bought last week at the very bottom of the dip (just lucky) at $576. We'll see if they honor it or if I'll have to go on an e-mail tirade. 
Edit: As a follow up, my transaction went through and I received my BTC today.

Never invest more than you can lose. 
I don't know how far down it's going, but long term I believe in bitcoin. I'm buying some at set intervals on the way down with money I can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:26:45
What the hell is this? There's no way someone is legitimately offering those prices for BTC. That's serious money that can be made back just reselling on coinbase.
Strong scam senses tingling.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:59:41
Long term bear, I take it?
It's certainly not positive acceptance as our favorite spindoctors will say, but it wasn't a ban like many misinterpreted news articles said. 
We've received a lot of positive news too (Fidelity investment, for example) but we're still in a bear market right now. Short term through the holidays and maybe until after the new year (possibly big dump on New Year's day for tax reasons), I think it's going to be on a steady downtrend. I sold some yesterday, though I am holding 65%. I believe we'll start an uptrend again in the medium term (January/February, it could be sooner). 
Bitcoin has never looked better, but it's still a long way to go.

Never invest more than you're willing to lose. 
If you put in money, and won't be in a wreck if it goes to zero, go for it.
