Awesome! Have been using Brave for a few months now. Hopefully this funding enables them to actually introduce bitcoin &amp; make some necessary tweaks. 
Question: The software has been downloaded over 500k times, but does anyone know about actual usage?

mexBT &amp; Bitso are also great options.

May I make a ELI5 request? Specifically
1) What Gentoo is?
2) Who this impacts?
I literally have no clue and can't form an opinion without data.

Hi Patrick - Thank you for doing this so early in the morning. 
What do you think the impact of NYDFS regulation will have on other states?
Any chance the foundation is working with states to build something less onerous?

There is confusion both in the article and here in the forum, let me elucidate.
1) Federal license: You have 180 days to do this after beginning operations. Am still not positive GAW is a MSB and don't care enough to explore. If they are, they can file and it will take 30 minutes. I know, because I've done it.
2) State licenses: 47 states require a license however, not all states view crypto-currency businesses the same way. When I mentioned that no exchange has all their licenses, this is what I meant. GAW doesn't but then again, neither do the awesome people at Kraken. This takes 8+ months and costs $1-$2 million

Hate to break this to you but, 
1) You have 180 days to register as a MSB after beginning operations
2) Every exchange with US customers is operating illegally, i.e. without the required state licenses. EVERY EXCHANGE!
Don't know about PayBase or what it does to know if it's a MSB and requires one. If so, they can get one in about 30 minutes.

Kraken likely uses an automated document verification service. This service likely saw the watermark, knew it wasn't normal, and rejected the document. That's SOP.
If you email Kraken you can likely get this sorted.

I dig it. Want to see what they do WITH the government. Believe that if any government really started doing something with bitcoin it could get past its negative reputation.

This headline is written poorly. 
Most operators won't need to pay for this, just those who need a significant amount of hand-holding.
