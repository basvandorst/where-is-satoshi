What word? Who agreed to 2x? I don't really have a strong feeling either way, 2mb blocks don't seem necessary atm, and I do have concerns with storage requirements for nodes a few years down the line, but 2mb increase doesn't seem like that bad of a compromise. However, it wasn't an agreement between two parties as much as it was a bunch of individuals in the bitcoin industry having a closed door meeting, reaching an agreement independently, and presenting it to the bitcoin community as their demands to avoid a fork.
Core wasn't involved. I wasn't involved. I'm assuming no one asked you. So who exactly is going back on their word for not meeting the demands of those invited to the NY meeting?
As far as I can tell, the NY agreement is really more the NY demands, because the only people who agreed to it were the select few industry insiders who were invited. The core devs and vast majority of users had zero input on the "agreement", yet are some how beholden to it?

I don't know. This isn't a minor disagreement on fair price, this is like Apple accidentally listing Macbooks for $21.99 instead of $2,199, and being angry they won't honor the price.
If they reversed it after a large price change that wasn't in their favor, or some other clearly shady manipulation, that would be different, but expecting them to honor 125x the actual value due to a bug is a bit of an ask.

The issue was also largely exacerbated by short selling and futures markets.

Since this seems like an appropriate thread for basic electrum questions, let me pile on quick. What does the wallet name actually mean in terms of recovery? Say I named wallet walletA instead of the default_wallet. What are the implications of this name change? Is it just the name of a wallet file stored on my computer? So I'd have an empt default_wallet wallet, and an in use WalletA wallet? And neither matters if I'm recovering from seed?

Wish they'd get around to providing service to customers in all 50 states. That is the main reason I still default to Coinbase recommendation. I actually have friends I've talked with about bitcoin in 4 of the 5 states they don't provide service to.

The same thing that stops people from breaking into your house and steali g your valuables now: notably, laws and lacking specific knowledge of your valuables. Additionally, wallets are usually password protected, and paper wallets can be encrypted. While it is true someone could break into your house, hold you captive, and torture you for your password, they could do the same now with a bank account forcing you to make an online transfer, or purchase stuff with your card.
They key is to not go around mouthing off about how much wealth you have, or where you keep it. Its just like anything valuable - the less you talk about it, the less of a target you make yourself.

I think his point was that by buying it with bitcoin, 50% of the bitcoin used would temporarily become unavailable as overstock would be holding it, thus gaming the system to create more scarcity, while at the same time maintaining the amount of coins they hold by buying the same amount they spent on overstock.
Its a clever idea, although it relies on overstock holding, and we have no idea how long or short term that would be.
Essentially, if he bought something for 10 btc, overstock holds 5, he rebuys 10, meaning 15 are now being held out of the market. Paying in fiat only ensures his original 10 he didn't use is being held. Using overstock results in 150% more coins being temporarily unavailable for others to purchase.

Banks would need to buy the bitcoins from some where, and buying on a large scale would cause the price to increase drastically. So in that situation, bitcoin hodlers would make out well as they watch the price of their coins rise as banks scramble to buy up all they can.
As far as someone trying to control the market by buying up all the coins, even if they were able to do that, the real value of bitcoin is in the users. Even the perception of core having too much control caused a faction of bitcoin users to fork off, so if a govt or bank ever attained too much control, it would sour a lot of users, and tank the value imo.
Bitcoin needs to be distributed, both in terms of the network, and the individuals using it, to succeed. If any entity became too powerful, they'd run the risk of driving people to other cryptos. Thats assuming it is even possible as well. Bitcoin is already big enough, and the coins are distributed among enough users, that I think it'd be virtually impossible for anyone to try to corner the market. It just isn't a realistic threat worth worrying about.

Most people will tell you thay unless you plan to invest a ton of money into equipment, and have a cheap source of energy, that it isn't realistic to mine. I would tend to agree with those people. Mining is big business now, and chance are you cannot compete with the chinese miners who have easier access to the equipment and govt subsidized power.

Jesus, if the proponents of bitcoin cash want it to be called bitcoin cash, who cares? People act like branding and marketing are more important than the fundamentals of the currency. Could there be confusion? Maybe. But anyone throwing money into cryptos who is so uninformed they don't know the difference between the two, deserves whatever losses they incur.
This is possibly the dumbest argument between the various bitcoin factions. It was dumb when r/btc was acting like Trezor was a part of some naming conspiracy, and it is dumb now that we're seeing ATH in bitcoin, yet are still concerned with what another crypto wants to call itself.
Move on, this is such a non-issue. Trezor was clearly just trying to figure out what potential customers want to see on their products, and so they took a poll. It isn't their fault both factions in this bitcoin rift have such insane adherents that they'd purposefully manipulate the poll. Some of yall are way too invested in crypto drama.

I think a lot of wallet software actually creates a new wallet address when you spend coins automatically. There are 2^160 possible addresses (compared to 2^63 grains of sand on earth's beaches), so they're essentially infinite for our purposes.

I dont want them, and dont think theyre fully capable of, regulating bitcoin as a currency. I'm just fine with them regulating US based companies involved in bitcoin though.
