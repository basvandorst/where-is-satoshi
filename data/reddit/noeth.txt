Wonderful! It's amazing how this subreddit has grown in the last year.

Thanks! It seems strange that they show the private key on big letters on the screen though. Isn't that what you use to access your bitcoins? I'm a bit new to this.

Where in Vancouver? I'm interested in checking it out sometime. Do you put bills in and get a code or something out? How does it work?

That's me...

I did not know bitcoin was being updated. Is there some company who does this?
That's interesting about the miners being able to set a fee. Is it possible that fees will go much higher due to miners wanting more?

He isn't completely off on his last point. Sure, bitcoin is accepted in a ton more places than he says, but the Chief will still have to trade his coins for US money in order to pay for the majority of what he buys. I don't really see the practicality of getting your salary in bitcoins as he will have to use US money far more than bitcoin. Better to get your money in what you use most. Convert for what you use least.
Unless this little town is really progressive and he can actually use bitcoin for most of his everyday expenses (groceries, gas, bills, coffees, etc.). Then I am really impressed and it makes total sense.

Ah I see. The public address is the address that you would send coins to right?

I'm new to bitcoin. What exactly are these fees? Who do they go to, who decides what to charge, what do they apply to, etc.

It's also a small town. Doubt he gets paid that much.

Dang.
