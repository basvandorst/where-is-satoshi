You're only late if you sell. I think we'll see more buyers enter the market as bitcoin becomes easier to use.  Who knows what will happen with our fiat too.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:46
People who accumulated late are sweating losses and selling.  Let them sell to you.  They'll buy it back in a panic as soon as it starts to go back up.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:12:38
The only way I can imagine getting these back would be to honeypot the hacker into returning, and attempt to break into their system using whatever information you can gather from that.

Here's a pilot about brick and mortar businesses using bitcoin:

Chargebacks can occur on any transaction, this really has nothing to do with Bitcoin specifically.  It often happens during the handling stage for example; if a seller isn't careful, goods are shipped in a way that can't be recinded after a chargeback.  This is also Bitcoin being used as a commodity versus a currency.

Right now? ... I'd short the yen, then I'd buy Bitcoin when the same problems begin to hit other currencies.
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:21:29
He states specifically that Buttcoin isn't a program.  Also, it's "Two shits" ... and why would Bitcoin result in chargebacks?
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:41:37
Let me get this straight:  People are buying Bitcoins online through a retailer who uses a merchant account run at a local bank.

If you are going to mock it, at least read it.  What's funny, is how blatant and obvious the manipulation is without people noticing it.  The "'er" tactic is right out of Idiocracy's court room scene ... you know; birther, butter, denier, flat-earther, hater, nutter, one-percenter, teabagger, truther, etc..  Remember in grade school, when you could win an argument with Sally using a phrase like "Sally's fat!" ... well, now the population is so stupid, it appears to work into adulthood.

That's what escrow services are for.

We don't have a capitalist system in the US, that's part of the problem.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:05:51
Massive deflation might be possible through heavy taxation that would force the economy to subsist on the remaining portion, especially if the Bitcoins were spent overseas with a country who manages to use the arrangement for unfair trade agreements.  Another reason to keep the government out.
As far as inflation ... This situation is certainly not possible in a Bitcoin economy:
 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:57:48
As a commodity, it has this problem.  As a currency, it would have to be massively deflated to accomplish the sort of insider lending that allows much of this to happen.
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:37:24
The Blockchain is essentially just an open ledger, how is that a pyramid scheme?  It behaves like a commodity because scarcity is part of the design and yes, this is deflationary in the same way precious metals (gold), artwork, real estate and many other things are in comparison to fiat currency.  There are some issues with this that can be solved with capitalist markets (like stock markets), that could handle large scale funding without immediately deflating the market.  I'm also a software engineer.

The information already is out there.  Are you proposing these laws should be allowed to pass in secret?  The list is a tool for deciding who should be supported and who shouldn't.  Bitcoin is not a terrorist group - as I'm sure many governments would love to frame it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:43:05
The information is already public, the list just centralizes it.  The purpose is to help the community when deciding who to vote for, and who to support based on their affiliations to the people on the list.  Many of these politicians work directly against the people they represent - favoring bank lobbies instead - and that needs to be publicized.  People should know who threw them under the bus.

Call (916) 319-3081 and leave a message for Assembly Member Matthew Dalabneh telling hm to withdraw AB-1326.
@_date: 2015-09-16 05:20:23
I'd like to see Assemblyman Matthew Dababneh go down in flames as well, we need less of this kind of thinking.   I'm happy about this, but I'd be even happier with a resignation.

People have a difficult time understanding things they can't directly interact with in the physical world.  I've had real trouble trying to explain the difference between Bitcoin and Paypal, as those completely new to it seem to see it as a payment service.  The idea that something can exist in a unique form in a digital format is also completely foreign to most people.  Unless you're a Linux user, you've probably never dealt with anything similar and the security that surrounds it.   
@_date: 2013-09-05 21:43:12
Bad for Paypal; if there was ever a good reason to support Bitcoins.

Plan a trip, they'll all require you to do it in person.  Some countries also require their equivalent of a green card.  They can be expensive to use on a regular basis too.

Ask a business owner.  When the government creates regulation, it's always hell.  And I'm sure some of it is passed with the best intentions in mind.
Imagine you come home tonight after the counter height uniformity act passes.  People on TV are cheering, finally, a legal definition for counter heights.
As you walk in, you discover a county health inspector is in your kitchen.  He tells you that your counters are one inch too tall and the kitchen needs to be ripped out.  
So you go over to the city (because you need a building inspection to do that) and they tell you that you can't lower the counters because it violates the Disabled American's Counter Accessibility Act of 1987.
When you return to the health department with this information, they immediately demand that the building be destroyed.  Hazmat teams are deployed, and your belongings are burned in front of you for your protection.
You are also fined for owning a kitchen without a proper waste disposal permit.
(Okay ... I'm exaggerating a little, but this is very much how dealing with the government is like for a small business.)

The volume is the important indicator for Bitcoin; I'm confident that it will reach a level at some point where we'll see some price stability.  Until then,  enjoy the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:18:48
Great ... here it comes; we'll need a permit to run a website, section 508 clearance, a government code audit.  Accepting Bitcoin will take an act of god.

Ya ... I wonder if doing it as a company would be easier.
