Read these two books to understand why Bitcoin matters :
1. [The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous]( 
2. [Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopolous](

That’s the price you need to pay when you are using Bitcoin ATM. At least 10% premium from the listed exchange price.
But guess what, you don’t need to submit KYC/AML crap to buy the Bitcoin. Which is great for your privacy. Nobody knows you bought that Bitcoin. That is the tradeoff. Try that with the crypto exchanges with all those KYC. You are leaking your personal infos with these exchanges in return of cheaper Bitcoin.

i have trezor but could not find this option.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:21:55
dont forget to coinjoin your Bitcoin. use wasabi wallet (desktop) or samourai wallet (android only).
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:14:17
thanks. that’s usefull.
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:30:36
okay thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:52:50
thanks for the advice
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:33:34
is using cashapp requires you to identify yourself ? hence kyc/aml required? just asking since i’m outside us. thanks.

the best podcast for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:58:38
it’s a scam

The best option is always use hardware walllet. The most secure and easy way to store your Bitcoin for most users.
Use Trezor or Ledger as these are the best hardware wallet on market today with easy user interface and user experience.

just stick the bitcoin logo to get attention from crypto dudes.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:55:18
it’s okay. it takes time to understand why Bitcoin matters. you still need to dig the importance of Bitcoin. don’t look at the price prespective only. look beyond that. btw, you don’t need to buy the whole bitcoin. you can buy and hold a fraction of it. 1 bitcoin equals to 100,000,000 satoshis unit.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:43:23
100%. sorry no altcoins for me. i dont believe other coins as i have not done any research besides bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:32:12
1. use remitano to buy and sell bitcoin. but you need to complete their kyc process in order to trade.
2. once you bought bitcoin, transfer to your Bitcoin wallet you control such as hardware wallet or mobile wallet. dont leave your bitcoin at the exchanges. remember not your key, not your bitcoin. your key, your bitcoin.
3. hold ������
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:07:08
thanks buddy
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:54:50
the ways should be like this :
1. buy your bitcoin from coinbase
2. transfer to mixing service. you can use wasabi wallet installed on your windows desktop.
3. from wasabi wallet send to your hardware wallet.
4. hold

use Green wallet from Blockstream.
