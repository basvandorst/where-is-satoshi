Both parties have to put in some starting BTC. For instance I make a channel with you, we both put in 1 btc. If I can prove at some point that you did something malicious, like broadcasting an old transaction, then I can prove this, and get 2 btc and you get 0 btc. 
I get back your initial BTC + my initial BTC, so effectively you are paying a 1btc fine for being malicious.

I would store them on a multiple addresses generated by an airgapped machine. After this the problem becomes to securely store the seeds. But this is quite easy I think, as they are just a bunch of words.

Of course people are free to do whatever they want. Then can also give btc away to eachother. 
I would not open an LN channel with the other party contributing 0 to the channel, unless this person is my friend or something.

See my post above. I had another look at the lightning network whitepaper, but I see no mention of channels having a lock time. Only the transactions/commitments have a locking time, as far as I can see.
So I would argue that once opened, channels can stay open for years, as long as both parties remain cooperative. If not cooperative, then one of the parties will want to close and broadcast a transaction to close the channel. That closing transaction will have a time-lock, but not the channel itself.

No, it's not. One could use a third party to *further enhance* the security, by them having encrypted copies of your transactions. Please note: You do not need to trust this 3rd party, as they can't do anything with your data.
For these hops when you pay somebody on LN network, you do not need to trust the intermediaries. There are unable to take your funds, and they can't see where your money is going. If they don't do their job, you payment can take a different path, and they lose money since they are not collecting fees.

"But what if i do something to knock you off of the internet or hack your entry point to obscure whats going on, or i just bonk you in the head with an oversized mallet and leave you in a ditch long enough that you cant do that?"
Say the time-out is about 30 days. Notice that it is not me who is checking if old transactions are broadcasted, my computer is doing this. So would have to shut off my computer (and in particular know which is my computer).
Furthermore I can pay a third party a small fee to check the blockchain for me, and send me a warning email in case an old transaction has been broadcasted. From this warning email I know that something happened to my node, and I have ample time to fix it (I would have 20-something days to fix it).
As you say, if my computer manages to prove within 30 days that you broadcasted an old transaction, it will automatically take all your funds in the channel.
About bashing me in the head with a mallet: Well then you would have to know who I am AND hack my computer. Moreover, if you are willing to bash me, you could also just mug me in the old fashioned way ... (Give me all your money, or I will bash you in the head!)

@_date: 2018-01-15 18:27:33
I think that, if you want to point out that Bitcoin &gt; Bitcoin cash, you should use arguments that are correct. Bch is probably being spammed right now. These spam transactions are often single transactions with many inputs and outputs. So it makes sense that there are less transactions in a block, and I think your argument is not really correct.
What is a correct argument, I believe is this: It is just as easy to spam BCH as it is to spam BTC. It takes 4 times as much space/transactions to do so, but it should also be 4 times as cheap assuming both coins are equally used and equally priced. Therefore, increasing the blocksize is not a solution.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:34:35
No you won't have to open a channel with shell first in case you had already open some other channel (say with wall mart). As long as wall mart has a channel with shell, or has a channel with someone that has a channel with shell, you are fine.

I had another look in the LN network whitepaper ( I may be wrong, if so someone please correct me (but provide sources!). 
The channels themselves do not have timelocks on it. It is just the transactions that both parties sign off-chain that carry a time-lock. The point is that, if you were to broadcast an old transaction, I need some time to notice this and then time to provide a proof of this to the blockchain. 
They also mention in the whitepaper that as long as both parties are cooperative, LN channels can stay open indefinitely.

Empty blocks are not necessarily done because a miner is "evil".
Suppose you just mined a block, then your computers have to some extra work to collect information for the new block and finish off the old one. While they are doing this, you can let your mining hardware already search for an empty block, small chance that it will work, but otherwise your mining hardware would be doing nothing.

yes. I think exchanges also want you to set up a lightning channel with them, so that you withdraw your funds through that channel.

With these forks, when you want to use them, you have to upload your private keys (which is basically your password).

Lightning network uses contracts. You find a partner (which you do not have to trust!) with whom you make a channel. Then each of you load a certain amount of btc in this channel, say 0.1 btc each, so totaling 0.2 btc. 
Say you are my partner and we make a channel by both uploading 0.1 btc. Then if I want to pay you 0.01 btc. I set up a contract which says that you own 0.11 btc and I own 0.09 btc of the 0.2 btc that is in the channel. To make the contract valid, we both sign it with our private key. Then I have effectively given you 0.01 btc without making any transaction on the blockchain.
You have a copy of the contract and I have a copy of the contract. If you at some point decide to close the lightning channel, you can upload your contract to the bitcoin blockchain. The miners will check that the two signatures below the contract are correct, and if they are you get your 0.11 btc and I get my 0.09 btc.
The trick is, instead of closing, you can leave it open for a longer time. Then if you want to pay me instead, say 0.05 btc, you can set up a new contract stating the new balances where now I have 0.05 btc more and you have 0.05 less than the original balance. We then both sign the new contract, and then you have paid me 0.05 btc. 
Now suppose that I have a channel with some third person Bob that you want to pay. Then you can pay him through your channel with me. I will be willing to do this for you, for a small fee. The idea of the lightning network is that everybody is connected to everybody through a number of steps.
I guess this is a rough dumbed-down version. 
Note that all this signing and checking contracts is happening behind the scenes, you don't notice it from a users perspective. The software is doing it for you.

No need for a direct channel to McDonalds.
You just get a lightning wallet like this one  . This wallet you put it on "autopilot" , then it will do the organizational stuff for you (open a couple of channels to LN network). 
After this you put some money in, and then paying someone on LN-network is just a matter of scanning a QR code and pressing pay. 
After this, if you buy bitcoin on an exchange you can directly send it to your LN-wallet program, this way you avoid opening/closing fee of LN-channels. A good exchange will also be connected to LN network, and prefer using LN-network, since then they have very low fees.
It doesn't matter if McDonalds uses some other lightning wallet, since the LN network protocol is universal (just like there are many different browsers that can use the internet).
People seem to be worried about opening and closing channels and that each time you have to pay a fee. While this is true, remember that LN channels can be extended indefinitely if both parties agree. So I think what will happen is that once opened, you will leave your channels open for a very long time, and just keep extending them with you other party. This way, you will effectively only pay once a fee for opening, and then very rarely more fees, since you'd be closing your channels very rarely.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:15:27

You can earn some money being a node, by collecting transaction fees, and at the same time you would be watching your channels.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:02:41
yes, I think so. I would recommend doing that only on an offline computer. Personally I used one of my old laptops from which I removed the wireless card. The wallet then of course cannot connect to the blockchain and cannot see if there are funds. But you can use the wallet to generate the public addresses. If the generated public addresses match to the ones you have, you know that you have the correct seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:31:26
You only open a couple of channels. You send the money to the people you are not directly connected to in several steps.
Remember , in this world any two people are related to each other in 7 steps (friend of friend of friend ...), Something similar will be true with LN network (maybe more steps, but this does not matter)

Since BTC has always been shaking up and down in all possible ways, it seems that for every pattern you see now, there exists a pattern in the past that matches it. 
I think you will keep seeing the same patterns coming back, until that last time when it doesn't repeat and it goes to zero or in a straight line to the moon.
So my belief is strongly: You can't predict what will happen to the price of an asset just by looking at the graph. I think one should look into the tech, think and decide for yourself if there is a use case and then bet on it, or not bet on it and then just HODL or not HODL. All the rest is just FOMO, FUD, hype, scam and market manipulation, which will get you nowhere.

Because Bitcoin needs to scale. To do this you need good devs. Changing the blocksize through hardforks, will introduce many other problems. 
We need to scale from a couple of tx/s to billions/s. This cannot be done by changing some simple parameters. New ideas need to be introduced and implemented. There are at least 3 groups of devs working on LN for bitcoin chain. Who is doing this for BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:59:11
Yeah , but if you have several channels, then coinbase (or anyone else you don't trust) have two choices: Transfer your transaction (and get a fee), or not transfer it (and do not get a fee).
They would have some information about your transactions, but they would know less if that information was available on a public blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:13:32
You don't have to open &amp; close each month. If both parties agree, an LN channel can be extended for another month, and after that month can be extended again, and so on. These extensions will not require on-chain transactions, and are therefore free.
You do not need a direct channel with McDonalds, just a couple of channels to the whole LN-network.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:21
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:27:55
Lightning nodes could block your transactions, and they could collect data about your transactions. So there would be some sort of centralization around large nodes, but in my opinion this is mostly irrelevant. 
For the blocking: You can have open 2-3 other channels and reroute your payment + it would be very bad for business to block, because people will complain about it and post this online. Then if too many do this, others will close their channel with your business. 
Second, about data collection: They would only know something about those transactions passing through their service, which is a lot less by comparison to a public blockchain, where they know everything.

If as a merchant you are worried about price decline while holding Bitcoin, you can now short it.

Opening/closing channels, all that stuff will be handled by the app you are using. 
From the user perspective it will not be different from having a normal/legacy btc address , paying will just be really cheap and fast. I watched one of these conferences on lightning network on youtube, and Adam back was there explaining that once your funds are in a lightning network channel you can also use them for legacy bitcoin transactions, so in fact there is really no reason to have your active funds outside of a LN channel. 
So what I will do is have the majority of my bitcoin on a cold offline wallet for safety  (my "savings acocunt"). Then I have a second wallet on my phone, where I put a much smaller amount (since a bitcoin wallet on phone is inherently less secure). All the funds in this phone wallet would be in a lightning network channel.

One of the applications of block chains is that you can prove to the world your ownership of bitcoins . This can be done in 5 min. I hope that at some point in time exchanges will post such proofs on their website , and in this way prove that they are not using fractional reserves.

I think we ware talking about different things. 
With reversibility I meant that once I have send an LN transaction to a merchant, there is no way for me to roll this transaction back. Of course the merchant always has the choice to refund me, but that is besides the point.
How I see a LN channel is that I would leave it open for very long, maybe even a year or so. Not open/close a new channel each time I visit a shop, like you seem to suggest.

For example: When the Bitcoin Gold fork happened, one of the wallets published on the official bitcoin gold website was such a scam. So when people tried to redeem their Bitcoin Gold by uploading their private keys, that wallet attempted to take their BTC.

If you have an old laptop, you could install electrum on it, then remove its network card, and upload the private key into electrum. Electrum will tell you what address corresponds to this private key, if the address matches the one that you have, then you know everything is fine.

It works via smart contracts. Here is what I get from it (which is probably not completely correct): Suppose we make a LN channel between us. You put in 1 BTC and I put in 1 BTC. This means that our 2 btc end up in an address that is controlled by a multi-signature (so several people need to sign to make a transaction). 
Suppose I want to give you 0.1 btc. To do this, I set up a "contract" which says I own 0.9 btc, and you own 1.1 btc. We both sign it using our private keys. However, we do not send it to the blockchain. We just keep this signed contract on our computer. Now suppose the day after tomorrow, you want to pay me .05 btc. So then, we just set up a new contract with our new balances 0.95 / 1.05 and both sign it again, and we just keep it on our computers without sending it to the blockchain. And so on and so forth, we just keep updating the contract to newer and newer versions. If at any point in time, you decide that you do not trust this random person on reddit anymore, you can broadcast the contract to the blockchain and get your btc. 
So very basically, you are sending back-and-forth promises and it still works because you trust the blockchain.
In reality it is more complicated than what I wrote above, because you could try to take money from me by broadcasting an old version of the contract (if that would be to your advantage). Using time-locks they have a way around it, I think how it works is that if I see that you are broadcasting an old version of the contract, I have some time (maybe a month or so) to broadcast a newer version, which would invalidate the old one.

Yeah, they will let you deposit from an external bch account. Last time I used Poloniex they were a bit annoying since it took some time to withdraw my btc, and I read a whole bunch of angry comments of other people with similar experiences, but in the end it worked out okay (just wait 1 day).
You can also use shapeshift or changelly as suggested below, but be sure to compare the fees of the comparable services. 
While you are at it, you can also convert your Bitcoin gold (BTG). To convert mine I used changelly.
Finally, something that always keep as a rule: Before claiming any fork-coins, I always make sure to move my BTC to a new wallet. This way, when I have to enter my private keys in their software, I am not risking theft (because there is no money at my old BTC address anymore).

Bitcoin cash has larger blocks, and so has faster transactions and lower fees. Litecoin has these properties as well, and instead of trying to take over Bitcoin, it has a more friendly goal trying to "coexist" with Bitcoin. In fact many altcoins have faster transactions than Bitcoin currently has. 
In my opinion, transaction speed/low fees are properties of a crypto that are secondary to the main properties, which are security and censorship resistance. If the crypto-bubble will continue to grow, then at some point banks/government will get really scared and try to crack down on it. I think this is inevitable. 
If you have a coin with only a few nodes or only a couple of mining organizations, all the government has to do is put those people in jail and then the project is dead. In contrast, if you have many thousands of nodes and many thousands of miners, the government will not be able to stop it.
The price bitcoin cash has to pay for large blocks, is a very large blockchain, one that will not run on cheap computers. Consequently only very few people will have a node. So for a government, bitcoin cash is much easier to "kill" than bitcoin is.
Finally, current implementation of lightning network requires segwit. Segwit is not implemented on bitcoin cash. I have read people saying that lightning network could be implemented on bitcoin cash, but they have very few developers, so who will do this, and when? Lightning network is already up and running on bitcoin's testnet. 
When implemented on mainnet transaction speed of lightning activated bitcoin will blast away bitcoin cash (and as far as I can see, also all the other altcoins).

I would say that with this strategy you have 
1. high chance of selling BTC too cheap
2. high chance of buy BTH too expensive, and
3. high chance of buying back BTC when it is expensive.

1. Before doing anything, first make a new wallet with a new seed and send your btc there. 
2. Once the above is confirmed on the btc blockchain, so now there are no more btc on your old address. Double check this on an online blockchain explorer.
3. You can download electrum cash (this is what I used to do this). Then type in your *old* seed in there to get access to your bch.
4. Send the bch to some exchange to convert it to btc.
Be careful with electrum cash program, there were quite some rumors about it doing bad things when I used it.

Why not? Since transactions are nearly instant, people can just cut up a large transaction into many very small ones. Some of these small transactions will pass through my node, others will find some other path through the network.

You can't recover the original file from the hash. I don't look too much at altcoins, but I thought siacoin was about storing your files. So if that's true, then the answer is no.
The point of storing a hash of your file would be to prove that you had the file before a certain point in time. For instance if you make a big invention but don't want to publish it yet, you could write it up in a pdf-file and put the hash of this file on the blockchain. Then if later anybody claims to have found the same invention, you can prove to the world that you found it earlier.

Yes it is completely deterministic. In the header of a block there is a number which is left unspecified, and that you can choose freely. The game is that you have to find a number there, such that the hash of the block comes out lower than the mining difficulty number. 
The header also contains a time stamp which is part of the hash. This time is not required to be 100% correct, so you can also mess a bit there.

No you don't. 
I would be comfortable making an LN-channel with the node operated by Kim Jun Un (which is a person I do not trust).
With this node, either one of two things will happen: Either Kim will pass through my transactions and collect a small fee, or he will not (in which case he does not collect the fee). In this second case, my transaction will pass through a different node, and Kim will not collect a small fee.
Kim is not able to take my money from the LN-channel, nor is he able to block my funds: I can close the channel at any time at will and recover my funds.

When sending money through the intermediaries, you do not need to trust them (they are unable to take your money). "Bankruptcy" is also impossible, because they can't spend money that they do not have (unlike traditional intermediaries). The people in the center will have some information about transactions going through.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:49:55
Bitcoin users run a bitcoin program (a node). Each of these nodes are constantly checking that all transactions are happening as specified in the protocol. If one person decides to deviate in any way from the protocol (e.g. by creating bitcoins, or by double spending a bitcoin), this person will be ignored by everybody else. Miners keep track of all the transactions in the blockchain, so that transactions can be checked to be correct. The miners do some crypto-maths to secure the blockchain so that it cannot be altered. For this the miners need to do work, and as a reward for this work they are allowed by the protocol to create a specified amount of bitcoin in each time period. The miners then go on the exchanges and sell these bitcoins to people who want to buy, and this is how new bitcoins end up on the market.

When I sold my BTH I did the following steps, and it worked for me:
1) First made a new BTC address, and sent all my BTC there.
2) Waited till transaction was confirmed many times on BTC blockchain explorer.
3) Downloaded Electrum Cash and entered the seed for the old BTC address.
4) Sent the BTH to poloniex and sold it for btc.
5) Sent the sold btc to the new btc address that I made in step 1.
Be careful with the Electrum Cash application, there were quite some rumors about it. So only enter seeds in there that lead to BTC addresses with 0 btc on it.

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:12:59
Let's suppose that BCH were successful in overtaking BTC (I don't think it will, but let's say for the sake of argument that it does). Then I think it will end up being much less valuable than the original BTC. Because something that has been overtaken once, can be overtaken again, so people investing in BTC 2.0 will be more afraid that there will be a BTC 3.0, a BTC 4.0, .... Of course on each fork you get both coins, but then you have to choose what to do : Keep both or sell one of the two possibilities... Since you don't know which one is going to win, I think this just adds fear, confusion, and will lead in the end to a less valuable system. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:37:10
Yes, I agree with you. 
However, to me it does not make sense to have every computer in the entire network verify and store forever all small unimportant transactions, such as buying a coffee. 
To me it makes much more sense to bundle them in one bigger transaction, and every once in a while close these bigger transactions out. 
In my opinion these higher layer proposals like lightning network do  this (and more) in an extremely clever way.

I think you are right that indeed node B will need quite some money, but they can earn some passive income from small transaction fees, so hodlers might like it to set up an LN-node on their desktop computer.
Moreover, things are not as bad as they may initially seem: Suppose that, like you say, A sent a very large transaction to C which depletes the channel B-&gt;C. Now money cannot flow in the direction B-&gt;C. However, money can still flow in the direction C-&gt;B and in fact more can flow in this direction. Note also that as soon as some money flows in this direction C-&gt;B, the path A-&gt;B-&gt;C opens up again. This may happen because of some unrelated payment X-&gt;C-&gt;B-&gt;Y from X to Y.
The LN network should eventually consist of many nodes with many channels, and a transaction may consist of a very long path with many intermediaries. I think the idea is now to break up your large transaction into many very small transactions, and search for each small transaction a suitable path. Since transactions are nearly instant, it does not matter into how many small pieces you split them. 
Note that, I am not an expert at all. I only watched  , from which I got the above, so it may be better to get your information from there.

Read carefully what I wrote. If I make a version of electrum that always generates the same addresses it does not need to connect to the internet.
That being said, of course airgapped is more safe. But the original comment suggested that if you use an airgapped pc then you are safe from man-in-the-middle attack. This was a wrong statement, and I was trying to point that out using my example. 
Tldr: always check your electrum software, even if you are installing on an airgapped PC.

It is possible to "split" your seed into 3 (or more) seeds, each one length 12 or 24. To unlock the original you need 2 out of 3 of the seeds. Knowing only one of the 3 is useless. So you can put 1 in the bank, give 1 seed to a friend to store and another you store at your house.
 In fact , with some careful thought , there are an unlimited amount of ways to carefully store your seed. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:24:44
I can still make a fake electrum that always generates the same BTC address of which I have the private key. Whether or not you install my electrum version on an airgapped PC makes no difference.

Suppose you are a node and I am a node. It is not guaranteed that the list of transactions that you have is the same as my list. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:55:35
My guess is that you do not necessarily have all the information. You might know about the existence of some transactions but not others , since you do not trust people to communicate everything. So determining the list of transactions with the highest fees is a very hard problem
