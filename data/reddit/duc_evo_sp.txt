Peter's dad should love bitcoin and he should love it himself. Andreas should give Peter and bitcoin education.

Everyone who hates BTC (government) is laughing about how easy it is to bring down the price with just a rumor.

Your either in bitcoin for your own greed or you believe that it is the next generation of currency that not being controlled by a rich few.

You gotta look a number, like the amount of money traded daily on the forex is around 5 trillion dollars.
Numbers like these makes me sure that there is enough capital in the world to boost btc market cap to well over a trillion.

Just say 2.7 billion people have internet access and they invest $500 usd each and divide the number of btc in circulation and you guys got your number.

If there was WW3, what do you think would have to the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-15 07:05:37
It's us vs them. 
Remember that this was written in 1988. And it spoke about this whole currency crisis. Now it's coming to ahead. 
This is there future but Bitcoin is our future.

No, The federal reserve pumps out 85 Billion in QE, so in my opinion is easy to pump the price. And manipulate it down with rumors and rules.

That's like patenting a time machine without building it first or seeing if it works.

People need to get it through their silly brains. Bitcoin needs to regulate itself and its own exchanges like a communty. "All as one" and not "one for all."
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:01:53
Wow! That will be the bitcoin quote on the century!
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:36:10
Great, I like Bitcoiniacs and done business with them. They are a great company that focus on great customer service. I hope the get the attention that their company and online exchange deserves.

I would sue the journalist. It makes journalist confirm information first before publishing it.

I like Elon Musk, I have been following tesla for years and I highly doubt that he would not accept purely out of loyalty for a company he sold years ago.
Image stepping into a Model S and sending payment through your btc wallet to the dealerships wallet. With the comment ...I took the white one :)...

I sense a conspiracy. Anyone think CIA might be controlling Karpeles to throw Bitcoin under the bus and let him take the fall? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:14:58
I personally don't feel that taking short and long bets should be done with BTC. It leads to un-organic highs and lows that destroy people's position.
It's leads to price manipulation. Similar to gold and silver contracts.

I get a headache when I hear about china and bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:25:03
Nah, that will only line the pockets of government allies and put the power into the hands of the regulators.
@_date: 2014-10-11 02:50:42
Can you imagine if Fortress Investment Group just teamed up with there hedge fund buddies and blew up the BTC market cap to over 100 Billion. And a cascade effect where every other Hedge Fund were to add a small percentage into BTC and were are at 1 Trillion.
That's what dream are made of!

What's the point of having a decentralized currency when the government imposes rules to stifle it's growth. 
And my ideals aren't one sided. I have empathy for the people who bought in the $800 and over. They are being put through the ringer and anyone who has a voice in the media or deep pockets can bring the price down or up at a moments notice.

Journalist should take responsibility for their words as they have influence.

Starbuck does have a point, if people have there target price being $1000 every time they sell off and buy at a lower price and they repeat the cycle again. 
And Lizard stop threatening people over the internet.

I hope he's put a bitcoin address on this trunks in a fight and the banner during the intros. That would be so smart for his career.
