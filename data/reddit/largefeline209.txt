I agree bro. I just am monitored at work. Proxy's don't even work on work computers, sights like Reddit 4chan and all alternative news are blocked. I'm a politics major that specialize in politics in the media, I am the biggest skeptic of the mainstream media
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:49:47
Maybe it's just all the Yahoo and Google Mews search articles I read at work I'm confusing for Reddit.

@_date: 2017-09-05 21:57:08
Bill likes to rationalize a lot because no matter how much reading anyone does Bitcoins only form of future analysis is speculation 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:18:49
More like: "Coin Base can't be that expensive, I'll buy one of those"
