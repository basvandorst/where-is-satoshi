So does this mean the Winklevoss's are trying to wiggle in?

That snarky low life, I would be camped out  side his place just to see his reaction when he realized that his  con days are over.

So why is "shared send" still being advertised on their "wallet features"?
I'm assuming people that considering bitcoin are savvy enough to know what is legit or not, but why would a bitcoin wallet like blockchain grossly advertise false information like this?
@_date: 2016-09-07 01:27:46
just because of the end user is not bitcoin savvy. A simple anonymous upload, download link make it their problem after the transaction once they download the paper wallet.

trying to keep their information private, and less steps than a throw away email or what not.

Have you used bitmixer.io to push money to those poker accounts? 
Just keep circle for regular stuff, but if it comes to some gray and vague tos just push funds from circle to bitmixer or other provider that you trust to make the final purchase.

I thought crypto was to free people from the chains of governments, sec, and the reserve, i.e. the people have lost faith in those systems.
Sounds like crypto is dead.

What's the average turnaround for exchanging once you pick your final payout, i.e. western union.

That's why sec fucked with ico's.
If you crypto investor and can't do research then don't fuck it up for the rest of us.
ICO were a way to get out of the reach of governments and regulator, not so anymore.

Should someone be contacting the ACLU for you guys, just to be safe?
