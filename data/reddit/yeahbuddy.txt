If there was a hard fork in a cryptocurrency, would your coins be replicated on both new chains?
For example if Chain A forks, the new chains could be called Chain B and C. If I had 5 coins on the original chain A, would I find that my private keys were only valid on one chain, or would I now have 5 coins on B and another 5 on C, both controlled by the same private key?

Convenience. I have about 0.4btc available in a wallet generated there for rapid transactions using their excellent mobile app.
All the rest is split over multiple bip38 cold wallets generated on an offline Linux live boot session.
Admittedly I haven't looked that much in the last few months, but for UK users, there is a lack of online wallets which offer decent mobile access (where the btc keys are not only stored on the phone). The only ones I found had ridiculous levels of verification required, which I don't want to have to bother with as I already own bitcoin and do not intend to buy more through the app.
If anyone knows of a decent solution, I'd definitely give it a look
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:45:05
I believe he was talking about the time taken rather than the price. I am interested in this as well, if the Bitcoin solution is both cheaper and far faster than using existing methods, then incredible benefits could be realised by the users.
Love what you are doing, its awesome to see solutions which help people avoid being exploited by the transfer companies. Taking 10% from needy people just for sending money back to their community is beyond unethical. Thanks for helping out these communities!

This is probably possible, but is not the effortless solution I am looking for.
I'd rather have my cold storage on 'paper' wallets rather than use a program. Less potential to go wrong that way
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:18:22
If the miners do not process the transactions, then they are not written onto the blockchain in the next block.
So your payments to yourself are broadcast when you send the BTC, and they are marked as received by your wallet. Until they are processed in the next block (and added to the blockchain) by the miners, they are not confirmed so are marked as pending confirmation.
I think its correct that you cannot spend the bitcoin until it has been confirmed. So your 100,000 transactions would be shown in the receiving wallet, but would be unspendable. Most wallet services will re-credit the bitcoin to the sending address in a few days if they have not been processes by the miners.
This also can happen if you send bitcoin without including a transaction fee. For example try now to send 0.0001BTC without including the transaction fee (Blockchain.info lets you change your transaction fee to zero), it will likely take a few hours to get confirmed, and sometimes it even doesn't ever go through.
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:18:55
Then it will be completely appropriate to use bits, and will likely be the best term for it. 
Now however, 0.25btc is far more suitable than 250000 bits

I just store mine as pdf files in a truecrypt container (which is stored on about 5 other peoples computers as backups). Even if they get into that, the private keys are still bip38 encrypted.
Have been tempted to print a few off and laminate them after folding. I like the idea of physically holding the wallets rather than virtually holding them!
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:19:38
If you plan to just leave it there, then I really would recommend looking into paper wallets. There are a few excellent guides on this subreddit, and it guarantees they cannot be taken in a bci security failure.
Paper wallets are far easier than they initially appear when just looking at the guides, you can save them as a PDF rather than print (if you use bip38 encryption), and best of all, they are free.

@_date: 2014-12-02 20:48:13
I love this. Hide a few QR codes inside one of my thousands of photos on my hard drive, and that should be secure enough.
You could even split the code up so have the top left quarter of the qr code in the top left corner of one pic, top right quarter of the QR in the top right of another photo etc.
Would be very easy to pop them back together, but I imagine it would be bloody time intensive for a malicious program to scan all your photos for the code. You could easily just keep a quarter of the QR code online or on another machine and it would be almost impossible for someone else to access your coins then.

In the UK, I can't recommend BitBargain.co.uk highly enough. I've done nearly 50 buys on there (varying between £10 and £1100) with zero issues.
They are very hot on identity and suitability verification of sellers (I know - I've just been through the process), which is the main reason I trust it a thousand times more than speedybitcoin or localbitcoins (unless you deal in cash).
To buy £1k in one go, you would need to get yourself verified, as I think the limit for unverified buyers is 0.5 btc a day. I have a referral link as well if you are interested - send me a PM and I'll give it to you.
For long term storage, you can't go wrong with a paper wallet in terms of security, but losing the keys means you would lose the btc. If you want to spend fairly regularly, a HD type wallet is probably your best bet.

There are mulltiple sides which can be taken though
* Bitcoin is significantly undervalued
* The VC investment massively over values Bitcoin
* Bitcoin is accurately valued at the moment, and VC money is looking to its potential value in ~5 years
Plus there are likely a few more. I tend to think the real case is a combination of all three, but VC firms are very frequently overvaluing the firms they invest in.

Obviously if the price were to double as, then this scenario is void, as miners would have the same effective fiat income to cover their costs.
I am just an engineer, not an economist, so I don't have the knowledge or experience to figure out if this is genuinely a problem or not, but I think it is definitely worth considering.

The site with these graphs are utter shite. On the *[same page]( as the graph OP linked is [this one]( sending completely the opposite message.
How can you have a pair of graphs from the same data set draw polar opposite conclusions, and expect me to believe anything else you say?

What?! The Nobel is awarded by a very secretive (private, not conspiratorial) Swedish and Norwegian scientific community. The US Government has basically no influence over the prize

Nothing at all but speculation. But when I log in on the app or the browser, there are 8 addresses associated with my account

Lots of laws like this are set or at least proposed by the European Union. So the majority of countries have the same rules

Likely they count watch only addresses as well. So I have 8 wallets as watch only addresses in the BC.I app, when actually none of them were actually created by BC.l

I have used Transferwise (in fact to buy my first fractions of bitcoin) and the service they provide is excellent value, unbelievably cheap compared to normal bank processes and also incredibly easy to do.
However, the methods they use to swap currencies are very clever, but also fairly slow. 24hr transactions are normal unless you pay a fee, which is fast compared to traditional banks, but nothing on Bitcoin.
I wouldn't be surprised if they are not investigating using bitcoin as a backbone for their transfers, as it would probably complement and improve their current offerings, and they are clearly a very forward thinking startup in finance

I am in the same situation. And there is no longer a contact email address on the Bitcoin24 website
