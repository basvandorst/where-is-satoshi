Hello!!! Is there anybody out there?????
Seems that LBC is scam... or, in other words, if you run LBC on your computer, your computer is running and working for this/these guy/s, and here are the proofs:
- Seems that rico666 is trying to obtain a new "allbalance file" with the last addresses with bitcoins ( In the meantime he continue using the same *.blf file, which has the 51, 52 and 53 puzzle addresses included. 
Running brainflayer over the current blf file, it detects the addresses with bitcoins:
mmm ./brainflayer -v -I 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000efae164cb9e00 -b funds_h160.blf
Rate: 253812.80 p/s found:     1/1572864    elapsed:    7.217 s
mmm ./brainflayer -v -I 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000180788e47e3200 -b funds_h160.blf
Rate: 291779.34 p/s found:     1/1048576    elapsed:    3.578 s
mmm ./brainflayer -v -I 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000075070a1a00900 -b funds_h160.blf
Rate: 345945.88 p/s found:     1/524288     elapsed:    1.732 s
But running LBC in the same address range, it does not detect something:
mmm ./LBC --id XXX -s XXX -p '
Loop off! Work on blocks [4021163596-4021163596] (1 Mkeys)
Will use 2 CPUs.
 (0.67 Mkeys/s)
mmm ./LBC --id XXX -s XXX -p '
Loop off! Work on blocks [6450351687-6450351687] (1 Mkeys)
Will use 2 CPUs.
 (0.69 Mkeys/s)
At the same time, you can detect a lot of network activity, so, from my understanding, you computer contacts with the server and sends it the information about the addresses found but nothing is communicated to you...
As I said, SCAM!!! 
Btw, why the generator code is not published so in this way we can review it, and, if necessary, compile it at home????
