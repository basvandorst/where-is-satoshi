It was rarely used because some people didn’t have access to it. Completely different. 
My parents got AOL in 94 and even then it was used sparingly since the number to dial in was out of state and would incur long distance charges. Once AOL had a number local to us they used it nearly daily.

It won’t be completely anonymous. 
A business will make damn sure to record who they paid in BTC so they can enjoy the tax benefits of spending their money on the service an employee/contractor provided.  This means having records of who was paid and how much and withholding any requisite taxes in the case of an employee.
Secondly the receiver of funds will need goods or services or fiat for expenses. Cashing out will require the exchange to perform KYC/AML, so the exchange knows who said person is. Online stores will have records of who bought goods since they shipped those items somewhere. 
The local grocery store that accepts BTC may not know who the person is, unless said person uses a loyalty card (the store could demand this for BTC transactions...). 
Point is the anonymity of BTC is basically non-existent anymore once you start interfacing with legitimate businesses and employers. 
And all of those points of intersection can be used by tax authorities to ensure compliance on the users.

This is very common.  Companies will offer a coupon to drive sales of a product; then discount that product later in the month or in the next month to drive more sales, usually to fluff up their monthly/quarterly sales numbers.
Wise couponers usually take advantage of this, since the coupons from the beginning of the month may still be valid when the company offers the sale later in the month or next month.

During Obama’s tenure BTC was treated as property and taxed as property, which was likely the one thing that kept BTC from being banned entirely despite a laundry list of uses towards illicit ends. 
The more people who pay taxes on crypto trades the less likely it is to be banned as the government won’t want that spigot to dry up, especially now with tax reform and less “paper” revenue per taxpayer. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:55:43
Possibly, but then KYC/AML will have even more bearing on those exchanges; right now some are willing to not bother with it until you decide you need fiat; if BTC can be used to pay for everything you can bet those laws will get much, much tighter on just about every business entity dealing with BTC.

Some ISPs have deep packet inspection which is currently used to ensure customers aren’t streaming or downloading movies. 
How capable this would be against bitcoin traffic is another matter and if everything is encrypted anyway then it’s moot. 
The government would likely not bother with such surveillance immediately and would rather go with criminalizing ownership and trade. That would kill most mainstream support until such time they have the capability to surveil the networks and put the screws to the ISPs. 
But I also don’t see this happening as keeping bitcoin outside the shadows allows them to **go to exchanges** for information on customers and use that to surveil whom the government believes are bad actors.

But you should understand it. How can anyone be truly critical of something they don’t understand?
It’s no different than the “death to fiat” mindset that is so pervasive here; I have **yet** to see a compelling argument from anyone how fiat dies and doesn’t absolutely destroy the entire economy with it; which would likely bring bitcoin down with it since good luck spending it when there is no power, no internet, no food and no water.

I don’t know how it is in France regarding mining but in the US when you accept mined coins (to your wallet) they are considered income.

The government isn’t going to willingly relinquish control of the money supply. And if the US Government were to do so then the states would quickly fill in that role or convene a constitutional convention to force it back on the federal government. Serious discussion of such would likely sink the economy. 
If states took it over that would certainly make BTC seem more attractive, but then states would likely ban BTC for encroaching on their turf, making it useless as a fiat replacement for day to day transactions with in-state businesses. 
If the government was forced to give up fiat through revolution then civil society collapses until the winner takes control; at which point everyone suffers, businesses likely fold or suspend operations until the situation returns to normalcy but then your ISP is out or the connections to higher level networks is out effectively destroying anyone’s chances of using BTC in the interim. 
This assumes the power somehow stays online (it might not). 
Thirdly perhaps government decides we have the ability to abolish money and provide for everyone’s basic needs (we aren’t there yet as to me that would require technology we don’t have). If that happens perhaps BTC could survive, but in a scenario where everything someone needs is immediately available for nothing and nothing more aside from what is needed is produced, what could BTC even buy you?  Would BTC traffic be deemed a waste on resources and be blocked entirely?  If you could buy products from another country with BTC would they even make it to you or would shipping those products be banned as well?

While crypto does offer the potential to hide illicit activity from the authorities the fact that many of the blockchains and their transactions are publicly searchable should make the government’s job *easier* if they know an identity behind a given address. 
If all governments demand KYC/AML on the exchange side they will bring a lot of people transacting in crypto out of the shadows, making their jobs easier when going after illicit users.
The government cannot trace cash as easily as crypto and yet we still use it...

The "sale" was the market value of BTC this morning/afternoon compared to all time high (20k).  There is no sale in the traditional sense.
If you believe the coin will go back to 20k or higher, now may be a good time to buy more.
I sold some BTC at $11,100 yesterday to reap some gains and I missed the dip to 9k this afternoon, and I am reluctant to buy in higher than where I sold as that defeats the purpose of taking gains out.

Well since Coinbase deposits to your wallet on their end they can prove they delivered the coins. 
The likely reason they don’t allow their credit to buy BTC is because on Coinbase you can buy with a CC and get BTC instantly. Wait for enough appreciation to cover the sell and buy fees on CB and you have a 0 fee, 0 interest (as long as you pay the CC bill in full by statement date) cash advance.

By looking at a Depth Chart you can more or less gauge investor sentiment; but given how BTC Buy/sell side looks pretty damn similar every time I have looked at it on GDAX, this isn’t a sure thing.

Why isn’t it applicable? Why do you think most on here suggest to HODL? Because Gresham’s law has more to do with human nature than with whether money is digital or not or what age we are in. 
Also fiat has advantages that Bitcoin doesn’t: I don’t feel bad spending fiat because I know its value only goes down over time and there are tax advantages to spend fiat vs Bitcoin (no added headache come tax time and no need to worry about increased taxes from gains). 
So I spend fiat to pay the bills, accumulate Bitcoin with the remainder.

The government can ban whatever it wants.
While it wouldn’t be totally effective (most government bans aren’t) it would be effective enough at stifling BTC growth.  Legitimate exchanges would go under, legitimate businesses that accept BTC would stop accepting it, users could become criminals for holding it and using it, etc. 
Point is people should stop believing that government can’t do something; it can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, without any regard for how it impacts the citizens. 
Doesn’t mean that the ban puts a stop to it entirely, but it would be effective at driving away most people and businesses from using it, which would do severe harm to BTC adoption.

I have no doubt they are coming to the US eventually. Low rates have gone on for far too long to raise them appreciably without the economy suffering. So keeping them low until the next recession and then going back to 0 or below is their only play left.

Multisig would work well for this. You aren’t exposing any part of a key to a standard wallet. Spouse gets one key, you get another and a trusted individual gets the third. 
Of course who you leave the 3rd key to the wallet with is another problem. And then what stops you or the spouse from conspiring with that 3rd individual to run off with the money?
At least in that instance the assets are locked away from 1 person running off with it before divorce proceedings without either the spouse or the 3rd key holder’s help.

They can’t reasonably believe that they can seize Bitcoins for which they have no access to private keys; they can’t be that stupid (although they could be that stupid). 
So the only way they could actually do it is by taking such from regulated exchanges, but then what determines that those cryptos are abandoned? Repeated attempts to contact the owner?

I have retirement accounts and a joint savings accounts with my wife; but all of my individual savings are in Bitcoin. I treat it like my savings account. 
Should you? Frankly that depends on your financial health. Do you have an emergency fund of at least 3 months, ideally 6 months, of expenses saved up in a savings account? Do you have no or low, manageable debts?  Do you have any retirement savings? Is your job reasonably secure?
If so keeping some savings in Bitcoin may be a good idea but it then depends on your ability to stomach risk.

We are beyond the point where it’s just up to users, especially if such drastic changes require a hardfork. The regulated on and off ramps very likely won’t support “Bitcoin with privacy features” as *Bitcoin* and the enemies of Bitcoin (Ver, Wright and company) will have the perfect storm to take advantage of to improve their chances of “winning”. 
And what coin will most miners support? “Bitcoin status quo” or “Bitcoin with privacy”? If the on and off ramps support “Bitcoin status quo” miners will very like stick to that chain (since they can easily get paid in fiat to pay their bills).

X = How much $ you put in. 
Y = Price of Bitcoin at Purchase
Z = Number of coins
X / Y = Z 
X divided by Y equals Z
So $40 / $11,700 = 0.00350877
So take Z and multiply it by the price now: 0.00350877 * $12,656 = $44.41

As an end user there may not be much benefit unless the merchant goes out of his or her way to offer discounts to accept Bitcoin. Then again they’d probably accept Lightning too. 
But as a merchant it makes a huge deal; money credited from Visa isn’t the merchant’s money until long after the transaction occurred. Up to 60 days after the fact (if not longer) to account for fraud and merchandise/service chargebacks.

I own diversified, passively managed ETFs in retirement accounts and Bitcoin. 
Originally Bitcoin was just a hedge, making up a small portion of my overall portfolio; but in the last year I decided I needed more. Still not as much as my retirement portfolio but growing every week. 
Some here think stocks will go the way of the dinosaur; I don’t. And earning a return for doing nothing thanks to distributions is worth considering. Bitcoin doesn’t have that at all unless you trade (and manage to time trades right; which good luck with that) or have built a service around Bitcoin people are willing to use.

I got Lightning App on TestFlight on iOS as soon as it was available. There was no way for me to get immediate inbound liquidity. So basically what I did was install BlueWallet (which is custodial but can be non-custodial). Transfer Bitcoin over Lightning to Bluewallet then used Zigzag.io to transfer from Bluewallet to onchain, which then went back to Lightning App onchain Bitcoin wallet. 
What did this do for me? Gave me inbound liquidity on Lightning App since I spent from there over Lightning without spending anything aside from miner and conversion fees to send coins back onchain. 
Also Bluewallet being custodial allows you to receive Lightning payments.

As I said in another comment there was an easier way but I didn’t do it that way initially.

I am not a complete maximalist, but had I simply held the Bitcoin I used to buy Dogecoin, I’d have been a lot better off (assuming I held it). So yes I regret that, hence why I believe I was drinking the kool aid. 
That said I still like Dogecoin and still hold some and add a little here and there. 
And I had Ethereum as well, but frankly I have become jaded to it so I traded that into Bitcoin this year. I also have some Litecoin and Monero; but if Bitcoin gets privacy improvements then the usecase for Monero becomes diminished. 
My other concern is how tightly correlated all crypto assets are to Bitcoin; I firmly believe if Bitcoin ever fails it will simply tank everything with it. 
The tribalism bothers me as well, just not so much with the coins but with the services. OpenBazaar for example gets tons of flack here because some it’s contributors spoke highly of Bcash and the company involved with OpenBazaar took money from Bitmain; yet it provides a decentralized marketplace of legal and illegal goods and does so in a completely decentralized manner, so what the hell is the problem?

I would think so given my understanding of time travel. Never mind that it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to travel back in time and then you’d also have to travel in space as well (since the Earth wouldn’t be at the same point in space from when one left the future to when someone traveled into the past). 
The only possible way around the paradox is the multiverse; but then people are not only traveling back in time but also to another universe; which seems a bit unlikely since we haven’t even sent humans to Mars yet and have no capability today and may never have the capability to send people beyond the solar system, let alone to another galaxy.

If it’s money you wouldn’t care to lose then sure. Then again people say the same about Bitcoin in general. 
You really should learn how to secure your own funds since having them in your own possession is what confers the most important benefits of Bitcoin: censorship resistance and cannot be seized without your consent. 
Cash App is a regulated entity; any alphabet soup agency or court wanting your coins could just go to them and take them. At least if you have the keys they have to bother you about it first. And spending from your own wallet at least prevents any entity from locking you out because they disagree with where it’s going (of course they could lock you out from their service after the fact but at least they had no way to stop you from conducting the transaction to start with).

That’s the problem though; those who didn’t file and did use regulated exchanges and moved money through their bank, there will be plenty of data available from a variety places to prove what happened and piece the puzzle together. For those who deal solely in cash on decentralized exchanges, there is no such data unless some seller gets busted for non compliance on KYC/AML and rolls on buyers whom they have gathered info on. 
So the unfortunately likely scenario is the IRS goes after everyone who was compliant, hoping to get them on some technicality for more money, goes after those who didn’t report but did use Coinbase and Cash App and largely ignores those using cash and DEX since good luck proving what happened.

It’s one thing to be amenable to how people’s perceptions may alter their thinking and world view in the sense that it would be disrespectful to forcefully rebuff a person who is colorblind to their answer of “what color is the sky”, but at the end of day there are facts that have been settled and agreed to and tested by many and those who hold a belief that such fact is *wrong* should be informed of their error. 
“I think, therefore it’s true” is not an adequate defense against someone challenging your assertions; people’s thoughts are inherently subjective and biased, based upon decades of experience, social interaction and perception; but that doesn’t give your thoughts (or my thoughts for that matter) anymore weight by themself; they gain their weight through consensus of those who *trust* your assertions based upon some quantifiable metric (such as educational attainment or work experience). 
For example, why should an individual writing a blog about health conditions and treatments, with 0 verifiable expertise as a practicing doctor be trusted? Why should their thoughts be accepted simply because they have them? Their thoughts on the subject could in fact be *dangerous* to people. 
A truly free thinking individual would be unencumbered to their emotions from someone challenging them and would seek to understand *why* they think something that is wrong and be open to changing their mind. 
And lastly, you are free to have whatever thoughts you want, but we are free to refute them and/or disregard them; it’s not an attack on your character or your person and you shouldn’t take it as such.

Like kind **never applied to crypto in the first place**. 
The IRS has always taken a very conservative stance on like-kind exchanges (so much so that they may as well not even exist) regarding every other investment vehicle outside of real estate, where the “like-kind” aspect is damn near meaningless (since they apply it very liberally to real estate). 
The tax law changes that made like-kind exchanges the provenance of real estate only essentially codified the IRS’s long standing position and practice of **not allowing** like-kind exchange of pretty much every single other potential investment vehicle in existence.

Bitcoin may only solve one aspect of that equation assuming it keeps going up: the impact of inflation on Bitcoin savers. But it won’t stop inflation from happening until it becomes the de facto currency of the nation/world. 
The sad reality is that those who are at the bottom of the economic ladder get a one-two punch to the gut: they don’t get meaningful raises today and haven’t in the past without learning new skills or getting an education and then get wrecked thanks to inflation if they do save their money. Bitcoin won’t solve the lack of raises for these people in the sense that if it was the de facto currency of the nation/world businesses would decrease the amount of Bitcoin paid to employees to match the increase in purchasing power Bitcoin affords, leaving those same people in the same boat today if they aren’t already frugal.

Well you are trusting Paxful’s system is robust and isn’t abused. 
For example a scammer may not start scamming right away; with a reputation system a scammer would likely want to build positive rep to then scam down the road for larger dollar amounts. If they can scam 5 or 10 people out of those $295 cards before the system shuts them down they have gained considerably. (Edit: and that assumes the reputation wasn’t gamed in some way to start; paying people for positive trades yet money went from the right hand to the left hand)
How does Paxful know whether an Amazon gift card was legit after the trade aside from the buyer saying it was? Is there escrow? Is an arbitrator one you can trust if there is escrow?
Point is just on face value I wouldn’t trust the product being offered, as I see no way someone could legitimately get those gift cards reliably without paying $500 for them. (Perhaps one got lucky with giveaways or sweepstakes, but nonetheless they wouldn’t get enough of them to run a business on selling them for such a steep discount).

Some of the exchanges in your image follow KYC/AML, so do explain how you intend to buy crypto for your clients without running afoul of KYC/AML.
This whole thing reeks of a scam; why the fuck would anyone think giving you their coins to buy on a bunch of different exchanges has any value when anyone who really cared about saving some bucks could do it themselves and minimize their risk considerably?
I distrust every exchange I do business with; I take my coins off of them **immediately** or in the case with Coinbase as soon as I can due to their fraud protections. I distrust them with my information generally. So why would I or anyone else introduce another layer of distrust by going through a third party?

The reason I don’t believe CW is Satoshi (aside from the obvious) is because there is another individual, whom I have the displeasure of knowing exists, who acts damn near exactly the same way in his own “domain” (game development). The person, like CW is also a fraud, has no verifiable skill with the craft he supposedly made a “career” out of and decided two doctorates from a PhD mill would make him “valuable”. 
In neither case can these two actually do what they claim they can do; so rather than ply their craft and show the world they are the real deal, they end up making a ton of noise over nothing to distract *themself* from their failings. 
To CW claiming to be Satoshi is the only thing he can do to make himself feel better that he **cannot** code like Satoshi. That other person tears down the game of one person (whom he has despised for like 30 years now) because he could never make such a game if even given a million years on this Earth.

Now I still have a soft spot for Dogecoin though and it has served me well when a particular exchange has shitty withdrawal fees for Bitcoin or other coins I want to hold. And it’s arguably better than most other shitcoins out there. But Bitcoin it is not and I am not even sure it has much growth potential anymore given Lightning and other coins encroaching on its usecase (fast micropayments). 
Point is when people invest money in something they are defending their decision more so than the coin itself. Which is sad because ultimately they will learn the hard way like I did.

Anytime I lump sum into Bitcoin (which I do sometimes) I get this gut punch if the price drops  afterward.

Committing to $X a week and sticking with it helps to keep the mind somewhat at ease about the direction of the price. Sometimes you buy low, other times high, but in the end it will all even out.

Bitcoin isn’t vulnerable to 51% attacks because the cost to mount one is prohibitively expensive and mining pools will seek out equilibrium to prevent harming their own economic interests (pool size will vary depending on the share of hashrate a given pool has to minimize the potential for a 51% attack).

The size of the blockchain grows linearly because the block size is fixed. Miners also mine empty blocks from time to time. Even if the number of users tripled over night and started transacting the blocks would simply fill up and no more transactions could be added to them, because of the size constraints. 
Also while mining may have some centralization with respect to pools, it is in the miner’s economic interest to ensure the network is secure from 51% attacks (since if a double spend did happen on Bitcoin because a pool had a majority of the hashrate Bitcoin’s value would suffer immensely). 
With the central banks and their cabal of banking partners there is no such economic interest to play by the rules, since the punishment is usually a slap on the wrist, even for serious abuses.

The risk of being wrong? Nobody worth their salt recommends trading stocks for the same reason and argue “buy and hold” is the best strategy. 
Buy and hold only requires being right once, trading requires being right 3 times. Buying low, selling high and buying low again; it may seem stupidly simple watching the price action of Bitcoin, but at a moments notice shit can go the opposite way you wanted and you are left holding either empty bags or heavy bags. 
What I find hilarious is how so many TAssholes come in here touting it rather than just doing it and keeping it to themself to make tons of money; but then I remember, it only “works” because they convince enough idiots to buy into it, making anyone who offers up their snakeoil TA a scam artist.

A potentially better way (and this would likely still hurt privacy which may be a nonstarter) would be to create a DNS-like system via the Bitcoin Core software by allowing full nodes to set a shorthand address (for example btc:GeneralZex) that when another node issues a transaction to that shorthand address it pings for a node using that shorthand and once found the send node requests a valid and unused receive address from the node associated with that shorthand address. 
The draw back is that only online nodes could receive this way and privacy could easily be destroyed (someone chooses a shorthand that isn’t unique, a bad actor somehow associates the person behind a shorthand, possible IP address leaks, etc).

A $50 purchase on Cash App yields more Bitcoin than a $50 purchase on Coinbase because Coinbase also charges a scaled fiat fee plus their premium. But usually my premium on Cash App is around $60-70 over market price whereas Coinbase is typically over $50. The premium may fluctuate and I just end up catching it a bad time too. 
Honestly though such a small difference doesn’t matter to me anyway; if Bitcoin is indeed going where I think it’s going $10+ in premium won’t mean anything.

Well the powers that be have their heads so far up their asses that they can’t see the gift horse standing right in front of them. 
For example Europe wants to get economic aid to Iran; well look at that Bitcoin could have done it easily. As long as no one spills the beans as to what addresses were used to send Bitcoin to Iran and the Iranians didn’t spill the beans about their address no one would have a damn clue. And Wasabi CoinJoin wouldn’t hurt either.

Average joe knows nothing of economics. Schools don’t teach personal finance, home economics has gone the way of the dinosaur in most schools (and even when available it focused on cooking and sewing; nothing about *why* those skills were necessary historically from an economic perspective). 
As far as average people are concerned with economic issues it’s that they keep consuming and buying products to keep the economy afloat and nothing more. A majority of Americans don’t even have enough savings to cover a $500 emergency and retirement accounts are woefully underfunded for most people. So no, average people have 0 clue about economics whatsoever, or those metrics would be substantially better.

You’re right. My concern was when they got the patent they had no official plans to support crypto and still don’t. So to me that indicated, at the time, that they were more concerned with tearing down Bitcoin by supporting law enforcement.

@_date: 2017-12-09 07:24:36
I am no expert but here’s the skinny of it:
Cash on hand loses about 2-3% of its value every year due to inflation. 
Cash in a 1% yield savings only loses 1-2% of its value. 
A 30 year bond pays 2.75% interest. 
Stocks on the S&amp;P500 have averaged 7% per year after inflation adjustment and dividends reinvested for the past 50 years. 
Real estate has (IIRC) appreciated, nationally, 5% per year, although many markets have seen appreciation in the double digits. Rentals sought by most seasoned RE investors return 10+% per year. 
What does all this mean?  A rise in bond rates to, say 10% would shift tons of money from stocks and possibly even real estate as it would be a high paying, absolutely safe investment, possibly crashing the stock market and increasing housing supply. 
Secondly, that raise in rates would also have corresponding rises in rates for bank deposits, mortgage, credit and loan interest rates, squeezing the credit markets if people become less inclined to use credit at all at that point, which could similarly disrupt the economy as people wouldn’t seek out credit to buy products or be less inclined to buy homes (especially if the mortgage interest deduction were to go away entirely as might be the case).

Even in that scenario though USD may not be relevant for daily transactions, but when it comes to paying taxes, fees, fines, etc, fiat is still king. 
Fiat will only become completely irrelevant if:
1)The government decides it no longer wants to control the money supply (snowball’s chance in hell of that happening). 
2)Government abolishes money because technology made it possible to provide everyone their basic needs at no cost.

Don’t fall for that bullshit. It’s pretty clear individual tax payers have to pay their taxes, regardless of where the money comes from. Even money from illicit means are supposed to be reported and taxes paid on it; but in this fantasy land Sovereign Citizens have crafted for themselves none of it applies.
It’s bogus; if it’s true these people are indeed getting their taxes set at 0 and all money refunded to them, the IRS is likely only doing so with the intention to smash them into oblivion with the legal ban hammer when their taxes owed becomes so ridiculous with fines and interest that they can never repay it in a lifetime and simply seize everything from them and throw them in prison.

You can’t deposit BTC yet (if Square ever allows it). 
However, you can buy BTC and sell it when you want to “spend” BTC. Square will make the relevant tax documents available so you can file your taxes for the BTC you sold to spend.

The IRS can absolutely make up their own rules under the framework of existing legislation.
Cryptos are not like kind, the IRS has said so repeatedly. Doesn’t matter what the new law says; it is irrelevant as it simply codifies the position the IRS has had forever. 1031 has always been very liberally applied to real estate; with everything else (antique cars, commodities, comic books, fine art) it has been very stringent with how the exchange rules apply (almost non-existent). 
Cryptos are not like kind by any stretch of the imagination. Doge is not like BTC, LTC is not like BTC. Different algo, coin cap, inflationary vs deflationary, etc. 
At best converted BTC to BCH could “maybe” qualify as like kind as they are similar enough but I doubt it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:07:24
Uh by my reading a 1033 exchange is **compulsory or involuntary** exchanging of an asset into cash or property. 
A 1032 exchange is corporate stock into a property. 
A 1031 exchange is transferring one asset for a like kind asset and deferring gains. 
So I suppose you mean a 1031. However the IRS doesn’t even consider two Telecom stocks like kind despite being very similar. I have read alt-coins are not even being considered like kind either. 
So I seriously doubt this will pass muster regardless of who you have under your wing helping to grease the wheels.

It’s not that Bitcoin will cause inflation; it’s that inflation runs amok with fiat.

The store owner isn’t going to accept $1 now because then he/she cannot refill his/her stock because $1 is no longer enough to buy a snickers from the manufacturer.

Sadly we won’t know for sure until it goes to court. But MasterCard would be stupid to sue, say Coinbase over it. 
They could and probably successfully sue the likes of Visa or Amex for attempting the same thing since it would likely be similar enough and novel enough to infringe, but blockchain *alone* isn’t enough; it’s in the implementation of some business specific need that would be novel and patentable. 
So using blockchain to handle inventory would be enough to patent a blockchain based inventory control system and would allow the company to sue others who use that *specific* implementation (and possibly win).

I honestly don’t think so. The only areas where it will have an impact on our lives will likely be areas we really don’t want it in the first place. 
The only way to make blockchains viable and valuable to people is to develop it like Bitcoin; yet those blockchains won’t be doing anything because the industries where said blockchains would be useful will make their own centralized versions that will be utilized where applicable and will come with all the baggage we don’t want. 
Take for example a blockchain that holds a user’s credit history and score; ideally whenever a user wanted to apply for credit they would authorize that one entity to view their credit history by signing with their private key; but such will never become reality because the developers who would give users that right won’t be allowed to make a competing CRA because of regulations. 
Medical records could also benefit from such, except the same problem presents itself when trying to implement it.
Blockchaining government expenditures would be great, but has about the same chance of occurring as a cold day in hell. 
But the government will go all gung ho on blockchaining IDs and physical addresses for people and tying everything to that, simply because it makes surveillance easier.

The government won’t care “how” people get their money, so long as any intermediaries are reporting to the government what comes in and what goes out every year for tax purposes and KYC/AML laws are followed. 
Aside from that you’re right: traditional banking isn’t going anywhere; it may adapt or change with the times (you know if the Fed is serious about developing their own Crypto currency to act as a completely digital fiat) but banking will remain.

Not Dutch or anything but in the US a lot of newspapers are local or state newspapers in their distribution (still privately printed and owned though). There are some nationally available newspapers (available everywhere in the country).

No it’s not. The IRS has access to every financial document from regulated banks and brokerages in the US. 
How do you think the IRS determines a person didn’t file a return despite having to even though income was made under the table?  Because said person put the money in a bank account. 
The IRS collects enough data to file everyone’s tax returns for them; yet Congress put the kibosh on it thanks to the tax preparer’s lobby.

For me, I just shift to the right of the decimal to quickly work it out in my head. So 1 BTC is $7200, 0.1 = $720, 0.01 = $72 and so on.  But even that has its drawbacks (like working out $100). 
Your method would be easier in the sense that once you work out the SATs to $1 just multiply by whatever # of dollars you want.

Where did you buy your coins?  Did you transfer your coins to your wallet?  
Basically you can set the order of the sells if you bought specific lots and transferred those lots to their own addresses. As you would have an easy trail of which lot is sold by its outgoing transaction. 
If you put them all into one address you can’t do this easily as they were all “mixed”. 
Also Coinbase only uses FIFO so if you left those coins on there you can’t use any other way without transferring them out. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:14:40
When I buy I don’t have money on Coinbase already so they have to take it from my bank, so I put in the buy order and from that day it’s usually 5 days for Coinbase to put the Bitcoin in my Coinbase wallet. Transfer from Coinbase to my own wallet is a normal Bitcoin transaction and goes quickly. 
The time between buying and getting the Bitcoin is likely due to Coinbase wanting to cover their ass by waiting for the money from my bank.

They were legit when I used them. But I last purchased from them in 2014, so they may have gone downhill since.

That’s the rub I have with a such a plan.
For someone who got in early, living on Bitcoin, especially now, seems like a no brainer; early adopters may have hundreds or more of coins from when they were sub $10, sub $100, and sub $1000; so a drop from $20k to $6k means nothing, he/she is still rich. 
So my takeaway would be for anyone wanting to go all in Bitcoin: accumulate for a year or two before pulling the trigger.
That way, any future volatility is meaningless as there is a large buffer to cover any down days.

Here’s another Avenue never mentioned: if you ever owe the IRS $1000 after taking into account taxes withheld and various credits, at any point in time you may be required and penalized for not making an estimated tax payment. Taking profits at the end of the year and filing taxes as soon as possible in 2018 makes facing such penalty unlikely, you filed your return and Uncle Sam got his cut before the quarter is done. 
Secondly in the same vein if you took profits in 2018 you now have 0 taxes withheld on Jan 1 to offset those gains so now Uncle Sam will want an estimated tax payment and possibly levy underpayment penalties if you don’t comply.

The price to pay to immediately take possession of your Bitcoins without waiting on bank transfers. 
Despite all my purchases on Coinbase they still haven’t given me instant access to my coins. Not that it really matters all that much since they are going into cold storage anyway, but being able to buy and immediately get the coins is a huge value add and worth the premium if you ask me. 
Coinbase also has a premium on top of a percentage fee.

I did that “successfully” once with BTC. Sold at $11k then proceeded to buy back in at $10k. Then it dropped more and more. It felt good getting a bit more BTC in the end, but had I waited like two months I could have nearly doubled my stack rather than the paltry amount I gained from it. 
This kind of cyclical price action makes it tempting to try trading small amounts to grow the stack, but you never know where it will go and if you end up on the bad side of a trade you could end up with less BTC than you started with (sold high but it never dropped low again). 
So I don’t bother with that. I just buy when I have the money.  This price is tempting to buy more that’s for sure.

The IRS issued that guidance in 2014; Trump wasn’t even president then. 
Also, Congress gave the IRS wide latitude to decide how things are treated from a tax perspective, aside from things Congress has specifically addressed themselves via laws. 
The IRS was within their right to decide Bitcoin is property since it technically is property. Perhaps one could make the argument that coins held in custody aren’t technically yours given “not your keys not your coin” but until the IRS agrees with that it’s moot. 
The larger issue isn’t whether it’s right that an agency can issue rules (they can and such has been held up in court); it’s whether Congress should be allowed to delegate their responsibilities to unaccountable agencies in the first place.

Short term the bond markets would see a large influx stocks would see an outflow and institutional investors would push companies to increase their returns to shareholders (by increasing profits, growing the business, etc) to make the yields on stocks better than bonds.

The problem here is not so much that Bitcoin transactions are traceable, it’s that a large company with very deep pockets holds such a patent and can use those deep pockets to pilfer data from a variety of sources that may have “promised” (but later reneged) a certain degree of privacy. 
Because of the traceability of the ledger, *any* weak link can unlock a trove of now useful data by association. 
And how does one dispute the data Amazon has found?  Like if they wrongly associate a person with a BTC address? Would anyone take such disputes seriously?

As you point out, there will always be that fear that coins could be lost; no amount of security will remove that fear *entirely*; but having a robust and redundant process can eliminate some or most of the fear.

In principle I agree, a full on ban of crypto is unlikely at this stage. 
But it doesn’t stop the government from a “soft ban”. For example I always felt the IRS treatment of crypto as property was the first salvo in a soft ban: its encumbering enough to hurt adoption amongst the wider public. 
Any increased regulation on crypto would have a chilling effect on the plebs as they would be unable or unwilling to navigate the regulations surrounding it; but it won’t stop the whales or Congress from being part of the ecosystem since they have the time, money and connections to help them navigate the regulatory issues easily.

True, but there are ways to divide a key such that you can minimize the potential of that occurring. Such as divide the key into 3 pieces where you need at least 2 to decrypt and have those spread out (1 at your house in a safe, another at a bank safety deposit box, another with a trusted family member in a safe).  It’s pretty unlikely all 3 places would burn down unless you live in an area prone to wildfires.

The thing with Bitcoin being deflationary is that very much helps you to keep your spending in check. So it doesn’t matter that next year it will be worth 3 sheep, if you need the wool from 2 sheep today to survive the winter.  Deflationary currencies don’t hurt savers like inflationary ones do, but those people still need to eat and pay other living expenses and that won’t change with Bitcoin; but that top of the line new smartphone, a new lambo?  Those don’t look so tempting when next year one could buy two of them for same amount of Bitcoin as today. 
Inflationary currencies incentivize spending today because it’s a hot potato that loses purchasing as time goes on. 
How a Bitcoin economy would work is anyone’s guess, but I would imagine there would be some degrowth involved as companies providing non-necessary items wouldn’t make enough money to survive.

There are very few people who know I am involved with Bitcoin. One friend who is also involved in crypto and a few of my other friends are highly skeptical of it. Some former coworkers knew I had “a little bit” but two of them were supportive of it generally with one being completely against it. 
Fast forward to my current job, shortly after I started one coworker began taking about it, but it was evident he didn’t truly understand all that there was to Bitcoin and I wasn’t about to correct the record and out myself to people I didn’t trust just yet. 
Later on I had asked one coworker if he had heard of it because he was the youngest worker there and he had heard of it and owns some; but I played the role of “outside observer” since I am not about to confirm my ownership with someone I don’t trust 100%. 
Point is if I don’t 100% trust those I am engaging with I am not spilling the beans about my ownership of Bitcoin and even then I won’t talk about amounts of Bitcoin or USD used to buy it period.

From what I know of Alex Jones the reason he was kicked off of Paypal was because his conspiracy about the Sandy Hook shooting and how his viewers began to harass and send death threats to the families of victims. 
And while I believe there should be freedom of expression in all things, there should also be the freedom of association for a business (and an individual for that matter) to choose who they wish to do business with or associate themselves with. 
I dislike how banks can cut off gun stores or decide they don’t want to do business with marijuana dispensaries in states where its legal, but I can understand their trepidation in supporting such businesses. But that’s also a good use case for Bitcoin.

To me, and I am no expert on this, Nick Szabo is high on the list for being Satoshi because he was involved with Bit Gold.

The reason I suspect he is Satoshi? I find it difficult to believe someone would have spent any amount of time formulating something like Bit Gold to only **do nothing** with the idea down the road.
2008 was a seminal moment for those who believe in sound money. And dusting off the old Bit Gold code and updating it, rebranding it and releasing it under a pseudonym seems a *bit* more likely of a scenario to me.

A self-directed IRA is a means of holding assets (such as Bitcoin, Gold or Real Estate) in a tax advantaged retirement account. 
It’s a good option given that there aren’t ETFs yet; but it is not without its own headaches and hassles. But one would be holding Bitcoin in such an arrangement and have some tax advantages to do so, and without any of the unsavory third party control over the assets.

But it isn’t better. It puts the government in the same position they were in before: they own the money and can devalue it. 
Bitcoin has its issues, but it really is the only way to achieve financial sovereignty.  If the shit hits the fan with a homegrown cryptocurrency it won’t matter that everyday folks can mine it.  It will still be valueless and worse, they couldn’t take it with them since who would want to buy it from them abroad?
There will be buyers for Bitcoin everywhere. And that’s the beauty of Bitcoin. If someone from a third world country leaves with a stack of BTC and goes to the US, they could find people willing to accept it for rent, food, cars, etc. They can improve their lot in life.  If they leave with their “3rd World Crypto” no one would accept it.

Really only on the speed side of things. But even transferring to Paypal from a Bank account via ACH takes time as well. Debit is instant though.
P2P payments (which a number of banks now offer) may be faster too, but I have never used it so I can’t say. 
But Bitcoin offers a number of advantages over those other methods outside of speed; mostly that one can spend their Bitcoin wherever it’s accepted and for whatever one wants without a middle-man saying no.

As it stands now most investors are chasing yield, so if bond yields went up a lot many would flock to them.  If BTC were to continue to appreciate at even a 20% rate per year, many investors chasing yield in a high yield bond environment may goto BTC. 
However the risk of BTC versus bonds may turn average investors away since the high yield bonds in my last comment are very low risk.

Depends on the transaction actually for the fees. Bank Wires may have fees; typically these are done for mostly international transactions. ACH transfers don’t incur fees (at least the ones I have done don’t). They typically take 3 business days though. 
With things such as Paypal and Square’s Cash App, the allure of Bitcoin for fast payments (compared to ACH or Wire) is reduced considerably; but both Paypal and Square may censor certain transactions (such as those for any thing tobacco related among other things, if they even allow such merchants on their platform).

Bitmain going public doesn’t change the rules (or lack thereof) of Bitcoin. 
Sure they are a threat to decentralization and them coming here is a double edged sword, but imagine what would happen to Bitcoin if China put the screws to Jihan Wu. The US government isn’t nearly as powerful (with respect to what China can do) thanks to the rule of law and long standing judicial institutions that will often protect individual and business interests (at times) against government overreach. 
The Chinese government could **under threat of force, seizure of all assets and the death penalty** demand Jihan Wu 51% attack Bitcoin into oblivion; such could never happen in the US, particularly today given how much the judicial system has laid the smack down on just about everything coming across the desk from this administration’s actions.

Most of my investments are in the stock market, with a small portion in cryptocurrency (mostly Bitcoin). 
There is no reason not to have a healthy mix of both. 
The determining factors for going all in to Bitcoin should be: what is the likelihood, in your eyes, of the collapse of fiat currency and will that collapse obliterate the stock market with it? Do you believe it’s likely that the government will steal our retirement accounts to fund government spending, shore up social security, etc? Or do you simply want to check out of the fiat game entirely? 
If you believe that’s very likely or simply want to dump fiat entirely, then Bitcoin is your answer. If you feel it isn’t very likely then put in an amount of money you are comfortable with according to your risk tolerance. 
To me Bitcoin is the hedge against those possibilities. Because if the shit hits the fan like that I’d rather have some Bitcoin than none.

Tether may very well end up being the “play money” of the crypto space.  Printed on demand much like fiat (perhaps with actual USD backing, but perhaps not, we don’t really know for sure). 
Tether is supposed to work like this: I give Tether $1 they give me 1 USDT(ether).  If I want my $1 back I give them 1 USDT and I get $1. 
There are doubts from some in the cryptospace that Tether actually does this, and that there is not a 1:1 backing of USD:USDT. 
One reason I have my doubts is that exchanges like HitBTC require verification for fiat deposits and withdrawals, **but** all fiat on HitBTC is actually USDT. Exchanges can’t get new Tethers without sending Tether USD (in theory), but how does the exchange get their customer’s fiat back? Does Tether destroy the tokens? Do they facilitate Tether sells from one exchange to another who is buying Tether?
Point is, Tether shouldn’t be held on to by anyone for any extended period of time, since it may very well end up being a house of cards that will one day collapse.

There would be no other crypto without BTC. So if it did launch today, it would launch alone, without competition.

I would disagree. **Human** involvement is required to keep Bitcoin alive. It has no sense of self, awareness of its surroundings, cannot repair itself if damaged, cannot seek out resources on its own should resources become scarce and should the entire earth lose power its network would die and there would be 0 chance of it coming back on its own, without human intervention.

Coinbase charges a retail price. It’s how they make money (on top of fees). The benefit to Coinbase is that once you decide to buy your price is locked in, even though it takes days to get the funds to them.

If you own the Bitcoin and trade it for goods, services, other crypto coins or fiat you are responsible for reporting it on your taxes. 
Some outfits make the documents available to you to make this easy (Square does it for all accounts according to their FAQ, Coinbase only does it for accounts after a dollar-value trade threshold has been met); but such is a double edged sword: it makes your life easy as a taxpayer who wants to report it, but it also gets sent to the IRS from the company that issued it, meaning you won’t get away with it for long if you don’t report it on your side.

A happy medium would be to have a debit card that would round up the change and convert it to BTC without involving the merchant at all.  (So if you spent $12.50 on something it would round it to $13 and buy $0.50 of BTC).

Merchants may offer discounts for BTC; depends on the merchant. Vendors for businesses usually (at least most vendors and customers did at my last job) used 5-10% up front then net 30 days. So the vendors or the company I worked for was extending “credit”; there is no added cost there like you’d have with credit cards.
I have no idea how Coinbase operates for merchants, but given their retail operation has fees and they make money on the spread between market value and their buy and sell values I would imagine they charge fees to merchants using their merchant services.

The only “value add” for Tether (compared to fiat which takes time to move from exchange to exchange) is that it can be sent around like any other crypto, but other than that I don’t see a point to it. 
The idea of Tether isn’t bad in and of itself, but the lack of audits by independent third parties to ensure there is indeed a 1:1 backing is the sticking point; anyone who uses and holds Tether is pretty much trusting Tether’s word that they are on the up and up.

True, inflation makes it hard to save money and come out ahead. That’s why the most optimal strategy is to keep a few months of cash savings for emergencies and invest the rest in *anything else*.  Putting a house fund in TIPS for example gives the person interest + inflation protection, but given the nonexistence of personal finance classes in school it’s no wonder nobody knows to even consider that. 
While for short term savings goals it really isn’t ideal to keep them in investments due to volatility, I have changed my mind on that one and have moved most of my individual savings to Bitcoin (since it will be a cold day in hell when I convince my wife to move some of our joint savings, despite inflation risk). 
My point is, let the fed do as they do and the rest of us here will happily do as we do with Bitcoin and if or when the shit hits the fan we’ll see who comes out on top.

The issue though is that that isn’t really possible given the state of civil society today and the existence of nations that claim people living within its borders as part of its jurisdiction with respect to law, regulations and taxation. 
And if those things go away (which I feel is unlikely), which would make this free society able to grow and flourish, it would also make for a pretty painful experience for those who lived under the old rules. And I doubt it would take very long to return back to clusterfuck we have now. And that says nothing for (at least in the US) the well armed militias that would take advantage of the situation and impose their system on anyone who cannot mount an opposition. 
So that really leaves us with the possibility of founding a micronation or seasteading. But both of those have their own issues and likely would cater more towards the wealthy by way large entry taxes or real estate prices, or the highly skilled/knowledgeable who are in demand. That still leaves out the poor and unskilled.

Corporations are not governments. There is 0 basis for free speech applying to corporations. They will provide the most minimal amount of free speech to entice users to their platform (to earn money) and shed those who may damage their platform (to prevent losing money). Those corporations are exerting not only their right of free speech but also their freedom of association. So until the government gets off its ass and decides user’s free speech trumps that of a corporation, worth protection by law, the status quo will continue. 
In my view the much bigger issue is banks, Paypal and Amazon deplatforming someone for things they say on Facebook or Twitter or their own website. Cutting someone of at the knees economically because of things they say outside of those economic services is wrong; but again it falls into a corporation’s freedom of association. 
I have no issues with open government whatsoever. But corporations aren’t the government and while I can wish all I want that this will get better it never will as long as corporations can call the shots without any government involvement.

I understand that; my main argument was only on the “slave” side of things. Whether we like it or not we are all slaves to *something* being human. Renting gives you freedom to move elsewhere as opposed to owning, but then you are just trading one slave owner for another, unless you end up with enough money to buy outright. 
And for people who don’t make enough to own a home (and those people shouldn’t get one until such time that they can afford it) and can’t save money for whatever reason, they will likely end up in the same boat as the person stuck with a 30 year mortgage: trading their hard labor to a landlord for just as long, if not longer. 
And I am not besmirching landlords here, my point was it’s bit disingenuous to call the bank a slave owner and yet not call a landlord the same thing; at the end of the day someone is getting rich off you trading your hard labor to occupy a residence, be it the bank with which you took out a mortgage for a property or the landlord who is renting a property to you.

I have mulled over potential use cases for blockchain and any containing personal information would need to have the records encrypted and unlockable only with said consent (signed with the user’s private key) and the records would only be viewable for a limited time by the party with which consent was given, with perhaps other methods involved to eliminate the possibility of screen capture, printing and copy-pasting. 
The trust factor would come from the code being open-source and (hopefully) thoroughly vetted by the community before committing any information to it. 
The benefit of this is that the end user owns his or her own data, but the detriment is that since it’s part of an open source blockchain everyone has *access* to the data store, making it a ripe target for attempting to decrypt the data (which may be nearly impossible or very difficult but still a reality to contend with).

Depends where you are getting it from. Coinbase charges a premium plus a USD fee, eating into that $10 purchase.  Square’s Cash App charges premium (which is a bit higher than Coinbase’s premium) but no USD fee, so $10 on Coinbase yields less ₿ than $10 on Cash App.
If you use Coinbase Pro you can place limit order and get really close to actual market price with no fees. 
However, I like Square’s Cash App since it’s instant using a debit card but you need to verify to withdraw, but once verified you can withdraw your coins and any future purchases immediately.  Coinbase you need to wait nearly a week for coin delivery and with Coinbase Pro you need to wait 3 days for the funds to come to them before you can buy. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:04:05
Square’s Cash App is instant with a debit card but the premium is higher than Coinbase but there is no direct dollar fee. 
So $20 on Coinbase ends up being $19.01 @ Coinbase’s buy price whereas Square ends up being $20 at their buy price. 
Need to verify license to withdraw

The cost savings of a few empty blocks is likely infinitesimal compared to the startup costs of running a full node from 0 with a 150 GB and growing blockchain. 
And I would say anyone looking forward to empty blocks for whatever minuscule cost savings they would afford a node should probably not be running a full node in the first place.
At best empty blocks being mined by one pool would lead to decentralization of the pools because miners contributing hashpower to such a pool may be angry they didn’t get the gravy on the top that is miner fees and mine elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:20:05
The blocksize of Bitcoin at its maximum is not an issue since it’s never been one. 
Mining empty blocks doesn’t help decentralization since anyone running a node yesterday wasn’t unable to run today because a full block put them over some arbitrary edge you imagined in your mind. 
Mining empty blocks is an attack; how many transactions failed to go through timely, despite a proper fee, because these cucks decided block reward + fee wasn’t worth their hash power?
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:56:26

And with paying rent you are a slave to the landlord, likely forever, because the rent increases every year and if said rent increases faster than salary you end up being even more of a wage slave; at least with a mortgage you are only a slave to the bank for 15 or 30 years and even less time if you pay it down faster.

Bitmain is loathed around here and for good reason but they have some of their Bitcoin miners on sale since they announced their new 7nm chips. 
Given the low price points they’d be a good place to start looking, but keep in mind the tariffs on Chinese goods will make them more expensive than what the website says. 
But with difficulty increases the miner will mine less and less over time, making it less profitable even with cheap or free electricity. 
Check out some calculators and see how the amount of ₿ you get from mining over a few months compares to just buying ₿ outright and play with some appreciation/depreciation scenarios to see which one comes out better.

From an article about commodities and taxes I have found this could be game changer regarding crypto taxation, the biggest benefit being that you don’t have to account for every trade, just net profit or loss.  However, that requires a 1099-B from a broker.
This could be a boon to taxpayers who trade crypto regularly or use it for goods and services, depending on how it can be reported to the IRS from exchanges that won’t make 1099-B’s available or if it’s simply not an option.

@_date: 2019-03-02 20:17:43
Custodial services defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.  Not controlling your own keys allows them to be seized a lot more easily. You also lose a great deal of privacy using custodial services since they can append a name and physical address to your Bitcoin addresses; making it trivial to keep track of where your coins go after the fact. 
That said CB and CashApp are good on ramps for people to get Bitcoin rather easily; but they should not be used for custody long term. Use them to get Bitcoin and then learn how to properly manage keys, use a hardware wallet, etc and take them off of there. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 05:52:17
This is partially what concerns me with people who argue that mining isn’t profitable in, say the US, and thus people shouldn’t waste their money. 
It’s not profitable at today’s prices and with difficulty it will get less so, but contributing to hashrate isn’t such a horrible thing, albeit in no appreciable way. 
And should the hashrate of China be turned off due to the government banning it entirely and having a very heavy hand in enforcing that, having miners in other parts of the world can keep the network from imploding will be beneficial and once the difficulty adjusts down to compensate, it may be pretty damn profitable.

If you are in the US you need to report the transaction when you bought Bitcoin and for how much and the transaction in which you traded it for goods or services and the market value at the time you conducted the trade.

There is no limit to what the Chinese government can do to force pool operators to do their bidding.

I couldn’t stand living with my parents for as long as I did, but there is value in sharing housing with multiple generations. The American way isn’t sustainable and it’s not a sure fire way to build wealth either (primary residences generally end up just being a liability long term). 
That said I want a home because I want my own slice of land to do (mostly) what I please with without having a landlord dictate what I can and cannot do. Having a home with land allows you to explore other options for sustainability: such as growing your own food or installing solar panels; things you normally can’t do renting.

But it’s a one off thing. Sure it results in less disk space and less bandwidth being used (although minimally), the increased time to transact because miners didn’t include any transactions in the block erodes trust in the system.

Bitcoin.com was selling BCH as “Bitcoin”. Ver has put up a bounty to Reddit admins to oust r/bitcoin moderators.  He calls Bcash the “real bitcoin” every chance he gets. Fake Satoshi (Craig Wright) claims all other coins will be subsumed and made sidechains of Bcash thanks to patented Atomic Swaps through NChain...
You see a pattern here?
Satoshi created Bitcoin and left it to its own devices because consensus is a pretty powerful means of self governance and decentralization is tantamount to its existence and success. Ver and Wright want nothing but **centralization**; they want Paypal 2.0.

A hardware wallet makes it possible to have multiple, secure devices for redundancy while your seed can be remembered or stored offsite or in a location around your home that is for a total “oh shit” scenario. 
For example, you buy 3 Ledgers and they are all initialized with the same seed. You store one in your home, one in your car and one with a friend/family member geographically separated from you. You take your seed put it in a ziplock bag, put it in a PVC pipe with the ends sealed with end caps, bury it 6 feet deep into your backyard. The likelihood of some random burglar digging up your yard is pretty damn close to 0. 
And if that’s not enough you can add a pass phrase to your seed that you have memorized and if the seed is ever found it’s useless without the passphrase. 
Or setup multisig with the hardware wallets.

Let’s say hypothetically you put up one address for a week. 20 people donate to that address. Now anyone can see what was donated; if the donators comment and say “Donated! Thanks for great vids!” someone can go back and potentially link donators with amounts by time stamps of comments vs donations.  Someone could also go back further and see how much donators have. They can watch this address going forward to see what you do with it. 
Let’s say you do right and setup BTCPay Server and use that to handle all of this: all potential donators will be given a new address to donate to. Linking them to donators will be difficult because no one but the donator will know which address received coins since said donator sent coins to that address. It also makes it difficult to track since again, only the donator knows the address he/she donated to and won’t see anything else until you spend from that address.

If I send coins to address A I can see whatever goes on with address A using a block explorer since I know it and have a persistent link to it via my own transaction history. So if the owner of address A sends those coins to address B I can see that too. As well, if someone is spending more coins than are in address A and the balance is taken from address C and D, I can see those other addresses as inputs and backtrack those addresses too. 
Ideally the owner of address A should never receive coins to that address again because it risks their privacy and the privacy of those transacting with them. 
Address really isn’t the right word for it since it implies permanence; addresses in Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies should be treated as a one and done.

There is a bit more to it than that. The bank could, effectively, be a layer 2 network. For example I deposit 1 Bitcoin into “Bitcoin Bank” and they handle custody obviously, but whenever I want to use Bitcoin all I have to do is touch my card to POS terminal and Bitcoin is debited from my account and credited to the merchant’s account instantly since we bank at the same institution. The bank keeps track of all of this on their own internal ledger. 
The downside to this is that then the banks could possibly do rehypothecation on consumer assets and should said bank fail or suffer a bank run consumers get screwed out of their Bitcoin.

How could they? Exchanges match buyers and sellers. Coinbase (retail) acts as both depending on the transaction, but Coinbase Pro is like any other exchange. If a coin is deemed a failure by its creator and is decentralized it could continue on despite it being a failure. If it’s centralized it’s dead. But who would want to buy it at all if it’s dead? Who would want to buy it if it’s a gamble as to whether it will live on?
So even if Coinbase Pro locked the price it wouldn’t matter because no one would buy it at that price and without also locking deposits and withdrawals arbitrage would occur further hurting users on Coinbase Pro. 
For example if the coin is worth $1/coin on Coinbase Pro because they locked the price yet the exchange I normally use did not and the price is $0.01/coin I could spend $1 to buy 100 coins on my exchange and then move them to Coinbase Pro and make $100. At the end of all of this someone will be left holding heavy, worthless bags while I made off with riches. (edit: assuming I found a buyer; but I only risked $1 while existing holders of the coins may have risked a lot more depending on their cost basis).

You completely misunderstood my point but whatever. 
Good for you? Paypal unequivocally favors buyers. The only reason they make you whole (and I guarantee they also made your customers whole too) is because they collect 3-5% of all of your sales every time someone pays via Paypal. So if you like them and like paying them for acting as a middleman stick to them.

To be honest, it doesn’t for me. The spirit of Bitcoin is to destroy the banks; it seems rather peculiar “Satoshi” would want to emulate one and then create this seemingly ridiculous web of shadow companies to that end. 
More likely scenario is some sleuth dug up all this BS and realized it could make for an interesting retcon of the Satoshi creation myth. 
Without evidence to the contrary (signed message from the genesis block) my money is on Hal Finney being Satoshi. He received a transaction from Satoshi, lived in the same city as Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto (and could have derived the name from him) and had himself cryopreserved; which is precisely what I’d do if I was sitting on a ton of Bitcoin that should, in theory, be worth orders of magnitude more in the distant future.

Square will likely roll out Bitcoin transactions on their merchant POS system; coupled with their Cash App, which uses a Debit card to fund, you could (if they roll it out this way) buy Bitcoin on there and pay directly from your Bitcoin balance. 
They rolled out buying and selling of Bitcoin on their Cash App beginning of this year; I suspect a merchant side roll out isn’t too far behind. 
They are much faster than Coinbase when it comes to getting up and running and buying Bitcoin.

I haven’t heard of such software myself. You may be able to accomplish what you want by using an offline Electrum wallet and using it to sign a transaction then bringing that to an online version of Electrum to broadcast it but I am not sure electrum would even broadcast that since there is no balance and the online wallet would be watch only for the offline one; so it would know there isn’t any coins to spend.

But the cost being baked into every transaction is what enables them and the credit card companies to offer these kinds of protections: because the majority of transactions will go through without any problems and act as insurance against transactions that have problems or are fraudulent. 
So Bitcoin could conceivably do that if everyone used a second layer that would charge those same fees and dole them out when fraud is discovered but it likely wouldn’t retain the properties that make Bitcoin valuable. 
Escrow could be made to retain those properties but still would not offer a completely risk free experience. Escrow with insurance on shipping can cover the merchant and buyer reasonably well enough; but it won’t protect people from someone stealing a package off their porch (which why should that be the merchant’s problem? And with PayPal and CCs it often ends up being their problem).

Moving funds isn’t a taxable event (directly) but the one thing I do is treat mining fees as a “service” thus making mining fees paid to move coins a taxable event as far as I am concerned. Truth is the amount likely won’t do a damn thing regarding your tax situation since fees are generally low, but accounting for them anyway saves you the hassle of trying to balance the books when it comes to reporting transactions down the line (since after moving funds a bunch of times and spending a whole address for something you will have more Bitcoin “on the books” then you have in your possession if you didn’t account for them).

I have my doubts that any privacy features will ultimately make its way into Bitcoin on layer 1. 
The reasons being is that privacy makes it more difficult to audit the chain without advanced knowledge or to put trust in those who have it or provide software to do it. Secondly anyone who thinks it won’t be super contentious is fooling themselves and many market participants have reasons to preserve the public chain at all costs (KYC/AML regulations, governments being amenable to Bitcoin because it’s transparent, but then putting other screws to exchanges, mining manufacturers, miners themselves, etc). Lastly Roger Ver, CW and others would be stupid not to take advantage of this ensuing debacle and fork Bitcoin from core developers before privacy features and run with it, scooping up exchange support and miner support and leaving Bitcoin Core with Privacy features relegated to the shitcoin bin since exchanges will use “longest valid chain” to determine what is “Bitcoin”.

From what you have posted here I would, respectfully, say you have a lot more research to do before you start selling your services. 
A business’s prime motivation is profit. Framing your argument for Bitcoin along those lines will help, however you can’t ignore volatility, you can’t ignore security best practices, you can’t ignore touching upon (although you **should tell them to seek a qualified accountant for more information**) the tax consequences, you can’t ignore the value add of a self hosted payment processor such as BTCPay Server (which is what makes Bitcoin a bit more profitable for businesses) vs third parties like Bitpay. 
Lastly all of this information is available for free and for absolute best security a business should handle it themself rather than having you do it. So ultimately the smart business owner won’t even need your services since it’s a security risk to accept hardware or software from you.

My hope is, and perhaps this a pipe dream, that as more people learn about Bitcoin they learn about what it truly is and how it works and adopt the thought processes that it requires (good operational security, verifying who they are dealing with before hand if there is any question about it, thinking twice before sending money). 
For example people may be highly tempted by a seller offering expensive, legit handbags for steep discounts for using cryptocurrency; yet those people should ask themselves **why** is this $1000 handbag being sold for $300? **How** is that possible if it is indeed the handbag in question?

Interest as in from a savings account? No you can’t live off that since it breaks even with inflation at best. 
$1,000,000 in the stock market growing at an average rate of 7%/year (which over the long haul happens but may not when looking at shorter time frames) would allow you to withdraw 4%/year ($40,000) and the money should last 30 years if not possibly longer. Sequence of returns risk becomes an issue though; withdrawing in a bull market requires less shares to be sold vs withdrawing in a bear market so *when* you retire could really make a difference in terms of how long your funds last. 
If you plan on retiring early from Bitcoin the only way you get there is either using Bitcoin, divesting into stocks or other income producing investments.

Because we don’t trust Robinhood. We have 0 idea if they are actually buying Bitcoin for customers or not. We don’t know that because the irrefutable proof they are would be to allow withdrawals from their platform. But they don’t allow that. 
Now imagine a scenario where you buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin on Robinhood and the price goes up substantially. At that point they decide they will enable withdrawals but because they haven’t actually been buying Bitcoin they really hope nobody does it since they don’t have anywhere near enough to allow everyone to withdraw, but everyone attempts to withdraw. 
They reach a point where people put in a $1000 to buy Bitcoin but they are paying $10,000 for that amount of Bitcoin to allow that user to withdraw: they promptly go out of business because they have massive liabilities they can no longer afford. Now you are left with nothing, hoping some protracted legal battle gets you anything but too bad so sad after all is done (edit: **maybe**)  you get your original investment back minus 30% for legal fees.

You are misunderstanding what I am saying. The bank in my example exists because people will be unwilling to manage their own security. The banks have a bit of a leg up here: they have more money to devote to security than average joe and arguably 90% of the world’s population. 
So the bank **handles custody** of the keys and establishes a payment network as a value add to save customers miner fees when buying coffee, groceries, etc. 
Without the handling custody part the bank has 0 reason to exist. Why would I even give such an institution “my accounts” when I can use the blockchain?

The reality is: no one can pick up a penny in one second, there wouldn’t be enough pennies on the ground locally to actually make it noticeably lucrative, and once you have accumulated any significant amount of pennies the amount of time to haul them to the bank for a coin counter or roll them would end up costing you more time/money.

I think there is a snowball’s chance in hell that we will ever see sustained deflation from the Fed. We may have a period of deflation because inflation exceeded the Fed’s target rate, but it won’t last long enough to matter much at all and would likely only be enough to offset the inflation excess of the last year (edit: or quarter). 
And given how Trump and the Fed wants lower rates and negative rates have their share of love from some central bankers, no one should assume we will ever see deflation from the central banks.

One way to handle it is to look at how much money you put in before gains; let’s say for argument’s sake it’s $1000. We end up hitting a price point where your $1000 of Bitcoin is worth $2000. So you cash out $1000 worth and leave the other $1000. You’ve taken out your original investment and still have a piece of the pie to grow further. If it crashes you can buy back if you so desire, if it keeps going up you still have a seat at the table.

Real estate investors shouldn’t be hoping the market keeps going up; they should be collecting rent, at which point most of the costs associated with the rental, save (**edit: unexpected**) maintenance, (**edit: these costs would be budgeted for and set aside from collected rent; it’s only when a cost exceeds budgeted figures that they aren’t passed on**) are passed on to tenants.
The area I grew up was nearly fully developed and as the area grew in wealth newcomers would buy two parcels to consolidate and build a new McMansion where two homes once were, further depleting the supply; and the availability and capability to build high density housing was limited because either parcels weren’t available to accommodate or in the case where a parcel became available the permitting and zoning for such became too much hassle for the builders to overcome.
Real estate, in some ways, is Bitcoin outside the internet; limited supply and ever increasing demand thanks to population growth. 
Not to mention, real estate has tax advantages for investors not available to anyone else anymore such as the 1031 exchange.

Paypal favors buyers and there is no middle ground. 
A decentralized escrow service could be made that could balance the scales for both parties. Something as simple as agreeing to a 50/50 split of funds between merchant and buyer in the event of a dispute would be better than all of it going back to the buyer or the merchant getting all of it and the buyer being without the product. 
The middleman wouldn’t even be required until there is a dispute since in the system I described in another comment the multisig wallet is like any other wallet out there except it requires the buyer and merchant to sign off on releasing funds if everything goes well with the transaction. If it doesn’t someone is called upon anonymously to help resolve it for a cut; this also creates an economic incentive for buyer and merchant to settle the dispute themselves before going with the middleman since the cut would come out of the funds destined to either party who wins the dispute.

That’s what I find so interesting with Square and Cash App. Rolling out Bitcoin payments to their merchant platform would allow them to use off chain transactions via Cash App to a merchant’s Bitcoin balance on the Square POS terminal (simply deduct the user’s balance and credit the merchant then allow them to immediately convert to fiat or hold Bitcoin) without the workaround you suggested. 
The benefit of this is they can earn premium multiple times on the same coins: I buy $50 worth and pay some percentage of premium, I transfer to the merchant and once the merchant converts to fiat they pay some premium; since these coins have now been credited back to Cash App they can resell them again.

In fiat you profited.  If that’s all you want then cool, you made out. But if you want Bitcoin rather than fiat the price needs to dip again and you need to buy in again or you didn’t gain any more Bitcoin than you started with. 
Which is what many supporters of Bitcoin actually care about, growing their stacks of Bitcoin. And it’s why trading is viewed as an easy way to lose; the market is irrational and what seemed like easy money one day can turn against you quickly. 
For example in your hypothetical trade if Bitcoin doesn’t stop at $12k and keeps going to $16k, $20k or $30k the person who actually wanted Bitcoin after what seemed like a fool proof trade is left in the dust with little hope of getting back to where they started.

Addresses can be spied on yes. But if it’s a used and empty address it’s a dead end; a user shouldn’t reuse an address and most wallets issue a new receiving address once one is used to dissuade reuse. 
The dust serves as a means of reactivating a used address to spy on all addresses in the same wallet if the user isn’t careful. And I wouldn’t doubt that most dust attack victims are in fact targeted because chainanalysis or hackers have figured out the person behind an old address and they hope to associate that person with other addresses.

@_date: 2019-06-29 01:50:00
They can track any other addresses in that wallet if the dust ends up getting scooped up into a new transaction.  
For example if you have 0.5 ₿ spread amongst 5 addresses with a previously used and now empty sixth address in the wallet, that gets dust attacked, when you go to send all of the coins (unaware of being dust attacked) in that wallet it will spend the dust too; now linking 5 addresses with the dust attacked address.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:18:55
It’s a means of selecting the addresses to spend from as well as specific unspent outputs to use as inputs when spending coins. 
So if you had an address that was dust attacked you can opt to not spend from that address at all or only spend coins that aren’t the dust coins.

Problem is a company will want to deduct costs of payroll on their taxes, that means keeping track of where the dollars went to Bitcoin and where it went. Then you have tax withholding which would likely occur before conversion of salary to Bitcoin. 
They could protect the employee by not having a trail of where the Bitcoin went, but they likely would have that trail as part of issuing paystubs. 
The same issue rears it’s ugly head with independent contractors as the person/entity who issued a contract for work would want to provide proof that they paid those costs to the contractor for business deduction reasons.

I understand what makes Bitcoin a currency; but that’s immaterial to the IRS and even the government writ large. The IRS treats it as property, the CFTC can (at some point anyway) treat it as a commodity with respect to regulations, FinCEN treats it as money transmission for the purpose of KYC/AML, the courts can regard it in a different way in contract disputes, etc. 
People can also choose to not report their trades, purchases of goods or services or whatever else that’s taxed regarding Bitcoin; just pray the IRS doesn’t find out. 
Or people can demand change and support candidates that will change the laws.

“Facebook teams played a key role in the creation of the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, working with the other Founding Members. While final decision-making authority rests with the association, Facebook is expected to maintain a leadership role through 2019. Facebook created Calibra, a regulated subsidiary, to ensure separation between social and financial data and to build and operate services on its behalf on top of the Libra network.”
“Once the Libra network launches, Facebook, and its affiliates, will have the same commitments, privileges, and financial obligations as any other Founding Member. As one member among many, Facebook’s role in governance of the association will be equal to that of its peers.”
The fact Facebook also founded that LLC (which there is damn near 0 information about online) is just more evidence of their misdeeds; I am sure that LLC will also join the association to ensure Facebook is given more voting weight in the Association through two entities they own being on it.

If I trust the people I am talking to 100% then I am a bit more open about it. If not I will only talk to them about it as an outside observer: “I looked into it and know a little bit about it but never bought it.”
But I rarely bring it up. At my current job I have only talked about it with two coworkers; one who brought it up and really didn’t understand it, although I didn’t correct the record since I didn’t want to seem like I **knew about it in detail**. I asked one coworker if he ever heard of it and that coworker mentioned buying Bitcoin and ripple. I wasn’t comfortable spilling the beans that I owned any. 
Truth is, my financial affairs aren’t anyone else’s business (especially acquaintances; I am bit more open about it with friends since we will talk stocks and crypto from time to time) so that is my “Prime Directive”. Secondly personal security is another concern although less so to some extent. But, unlike brokerage accounts or money in the bank, Bitcoin can be easily stolen with a $5 wrench attack.

Except if you have a Mars colony they would likely get screwed using Bitcoin because Earth would have the majority of the hashrate, would find blocks and alert nodes they did so long before Mars found 1 (and Earth could find up to 4 blocks before the Mars block even reached Earth nodes).

I think the only “crypto” about Facebook’s coin is that it’s based on the same principles of securing the money supply and ledger like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: cryptography. Why? Because the information to make it work is publicly available thanks to the open source nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If they wanted to create a bank using traditional means they’d have do it from scratch. 
I firmly believe that Facebook’s coin will be nothing more than Paypal on Facebook’s front end and its backend will just be any other centralized cryptocurrency.
People reading that it’s “a cryptocurrency” are reading too much into it.  It will be everything Bitcoin was created to offer an out from.

They are randomly assigned by the protocol and are anonymous so collusion is unlikely, although possible, but they’d lose their bond if the collusion was discovered. And if both traders dispute the Arbitrator’s resolution they can confiscate the bond. 
The only issue with the BSQ bond process is that BSQ tokens can only be earned by contributing to the project and can’t be purchased so Arbitrators aren’t fully neutral (although they can act neutrally for the basis of trade disputes) as they have invested significant time to the project itself. Arbitrators get trade fees. 
The bonding process is part of (among other things) Bisq’s Phase 0 of becoming a fully decentralized autonomous organization.

While Facebook says all “founders” will be equal and that may ultimately be true, who wins out the most in the end? Facebook, because their business is data and all of those companies may not yet share data with them but will once Libra gets off the ground, if it ever does. 
And one needs to only ask why Paypal would even want to join the Association in the first place? Because they know damn well Facebook will absolutely destroy them with Libra, so if you can’t beat them, join them.

I had made some trades in late 2017 and early 2018; I did ok on some, but with Bitcoin I ended up selling at 11k and bought back in at 10k, seeing it trade around there for a few days; then it kept dropping. At that point I said to hell with it and just moved the coins off GDAX(now Coinbase Pro). 
In hindsight I could have grown the stack selling and rebuying lower; but hindsight is 20/20. 
And the tax reporting kills me; it makes trading almost not worth it with the extra headache of compiling trades. And at the end of the day I wouldn’t want to trade Bitcoin anyway. If I end up on the wrong side of a trade I am left without the Bitcoin I sold hoping for a dip.

The use case is reflected by the price: USD loses purchasing power YOY. This year so far Bitcoin purchasing power has increased considerably and has increased astronomically from where it was 10 years ago. Yes it’s volatile and there were bear markets, but in my opinion Bitcoin will become increasingly important as a store of value in the coming years: talk of a recession being likely according to economists, Trump wanting lower interest rates (and the Fed indicating such is on the table), ECB talking negative rates, trade concerns, capital flight from China, concerns about Iran (and Iran’s economic situation, along with Venezuela’s). 
And lastly the best way to grow merchant adoption is to *spread the word*. Learn about BTCPayServer so you can inform merchants of the best way they can accept Bitcoin and become totally independent of payment processors (unlikely they will drop credit/debit; but at the very least they aren’t adding *yet another* 3rd party payment processor).

Sure there are risks with Bitcoin. It could be replaced, it could be banned and its volatile as all hell; but I am sticking with it. And even if it’s banned they’ll have to pry it from my cold dead fingers. I may not be a maximalist like others here and I do not hold as much of a negative view of the Fed or its policies as others do here, but as far as I am concerned financial sovereignty is a human right, regardless of what the powers that be think and if they should choose to ban Bitcoin, it simply tells me they are afraid of us and what Bitcoin represents as an ideal.

But having a mortgage at a fixed rate locks the bulk of your housing costs to the terms of the loan; with renting all of your housing costs are subject to inflation: rent generally goes up at least matching inflation but increases as much as 5% or more (which is substantially more than inflation) are possible depending on the market. And in some markets buying is cheaper than renting; in others the reverse is true. 
Another thing worth considering is with a mortgage you are making the bank richer, but you own it when it’s paid off; with renting you make the landlord richer and have nothing to show for it whatsoever.

Human memory is rather fallible; we forget things, misremember things and outright create false memories. It may work for you and that’s cool, but it won’t be cool when you wake up one day and replace one word with another and have absolutely no idea what the “right” word is because there is no other backup to refer to. 
To top it off, an accident or disease can rob you of your memory as well. 
While there are plenty of things I can remember from childhood, I still wouldn’t trust my Bitcoin holdings to memory alone.
Edit: And another aspect to memory that is rather awful is memory implantation; which is another person making someone remember something that never occurred.

While there is no shortage of sheisty businesses out there, no one should bank on their employer saying to hell with taxes and tax filing when it comes to paying anyone in Bitcoin. 
How the employees handle it is their business; but the paper trail will be there and if said businesses provide addresses to the IRS as part of their filings it’s game over for those who accept payment and don’t file their taxes since it’s trivial to follow the money on the blockchain.

If you earn Bitcoin the dollar value when you receive it is your income and also your cost basis for gains or losses. If you trade Bitcoin (or any crypto) for goods, services, fiat or other crypto its a taxable event. 
It’s not rocket science; but it’s tedious as fuck if you trade a lot. 
I don’t know whether the IRS can see through VPNs or TOR, but I wouldn’t doubt that the NSA or CIA has that capability; whether they forward such information to the IRS is another story. 
Regardless you are responsible for paying your taxes; whether you do so or not is up to you.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:07:17
If you accept 1 BTC as payment for service and a BTC is worth $6000 when you accepted it that is your cost basis. If you sell/trade it for goods or services a week later at $7000 you have a short term capital gain of $1000 (Sale Price - Cost Basis). 
That short term capital gain is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. 
If you held the same BTC for 1 year and sold for $7000 your capital gains rate would be 0, 15 or 20% depending on your tax bracket (if you are below the 15% income tax bracket your rate on an LT Capital Gain May be 0%). 
Added: if you sell or trade that BTC it’s a taxable event. Added “/traded for goods or services above”. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:07:08
But then you have taxes to contend with; which if there are gains it’s a de facto cost increase to use Bitcoin rather than fiat. 
Sure I get what OP is saying, but store of value is just as much the point of Bitcoin as anything else; if it wasn’t we wouldn’t have a disinflationary coin emission scheme and hard cap. Why people would call this “speculating” now is beyond me.

Unless electricity is cheap it doesn’t make much sense to mine Bitcoin rather than just buying it. 
That said I was mining Monero and shitcoins from late 2017 to mid 2018 for the hell of it on my PC. Now I am Folding for Banano. I don’t run that 24/7 though; only during the day/night when I am home and will use my PC.

Well your plan is more sensible than mine lol. 
The problem I had approaching the thought exercise is that my goal would be gaining total financial independence, where I have the *option* to work if I so choose. So $1 million in Bitcoin sold into stocks *could* get me there, but withdrawing 4% or getting 4% in dividends only nets me $40,000 a year and will that last me the rest of my life? Who knows. 
At least holding the majority in Bitcoin I *could* see substantial growth and then pump many more millions into other income producing assets, just not on day one. Of course it could tank and my best laid plans go entirely to shit and I squandered a good thing.

I don’t know why that’s evidence of them being salty; the sub operates under the premise of providing tried and true personal finance advice. And while we here have our opinions on that, it doesn’t fit in their mantra due to the risks and volatility of cryptocurrencies. 
Should someone who is struggling with debt or living paycheck to paycheck really get involved with Bitcoin? Where loss of coins could wipe out whatever little they have managed to scrounge together? Or volatility makes them panic sell because they weren’t in a financial position to *forget about the price*?

If that receiving address is the address in your Multibit wallet you should have those coins. 
Copy your address to the clipboard and look for a BTC block explorer. Paste the address into the search bar and it will tell you the transactions for that address.

At a minimum; at a maximum it’s 24 minutes. And yes it is a big deal. Total transit time for a transaction (me sending it and me getting confirmation) would be on the order of at a maximum, assuming it goes into the next block, 24 minutes from me, ~10 minutes into the next block and the 24 minutes back to me.  And at what cost? If the transaction has to happen within the hour I’d need to set a huge fee to ensure that happens, which I won’t know the best fee because of the delays involved. 
Earthers could gum up the mempool and drive fees sky high as a sort of a “sanction” against Martians and since Earthers have all the hashrate Martians can’t do jack shit about it. 
Bitcoin works on Earth because we are part of a community and we’re all on a semi level playing field since latency isn’t a huge deal for earth bound internet traffic. But latency will be a huge deal between Earth and Mars and any existing political or social issues between the two planets will be exacerbated by Bitcoin. 
And in the minds of Martians, Earth controls Bitcoin so why would they even bother when they can’t enjoy one of the core tenets of Bitcoin that is “no one controls it”?

Technically yes. I’ll use the example of Square and Cash App to illustrate my point. Right now you can buy Bitcoin on Cash App using a debit card. You can withdraw to your wallet once you have confirmed ID and can sell it within the app but you can’t deposit Bitcoin yet. 
However, Square has their POS terminals at various merchants. If they enable Bitcoin transactions on their payment network, one should be able to take Bitcoin bought on Cash App and use it to pay merchants for goods and services who are part of the Square payment network. 
Since the Bitcoins are credited to your account on Cash App and held in custody with Cash App/Square, paying a merchant would simply see a credit of Bitcoin (or fiat at that moment’s spot price +/- premium) to them and you’d see a debit of Bitcoin; since this all takes place off chain and within Square’s internal ledger it would be instant and without miner fees.

It’s not that making changes to Bitcoin is bad per se; it’s that the changes need to provide utility to everyone. Adding privacy features to Bitcoin for example would be a desirable feature. At some point in the future a block size increase may be warranted and that could be a good thing so long as bandwidth and storage space has grown sufficiently across the globe to not hamper decentralization. 
However changing the protocol to add forced coin seizure in the event someone doesn’t touch their wallet for X years has no utility to end users. 
Look at it this way, there are perhaps millions of lost coins; but aside from someone saying “I have this {Address} and lost the private key” or those sent to BitcoinEaterAddress (which are burned technically, not lost) we don’t know for certain what’s lost and what’s just long time storage. So what criteria do we use for lost coins that doesn’t actually steal someone’s cold storage? Sure there is some utility reintroducing actual lost coins into circulation, but what if that individual of a lost wallet finds a backup or the private key written down somewhere and totally forgot about it? Now they have 0 coins and that’s not right. 
It’s just better to preserve the letter and spirit of the protocol and leave it alone with regards to anything dealing the coins side of it.

Yes money is essential, but you also need to cultivate your own happiness outside of money; doing things you enjoy from time to time, making meaningful connections with people and your community, finding meaningful hobbies or work, etc. 
Finding a job you are passionate about does a lot more to make you happy than the money earned from it. Conversely finding a job that makes you miserable and staying there for the money will destroy you.

Aside from buying and holding dividend paying stocks (and even then there is some due diligence if buying and holding individual stocks vs just buying an ETF), there is a lot of due diligence involved in securing passive income opportunities. Real estate can be made passive but it requires finding a good deal, getting a property manager (again more due diligence), scouring financing unless you have the cash, etc. Business investment you’d want to see their financials, involve a lawyer to draw up contracts spelling out what exactly you are getting for your money (stake), etc.

Institutions getting into BTC for the prospects of putting it in financial products traded on Wall Street can get skin in the game by using mining operations. Big brokerages already have data centers, adding a few ASIC miners to it will be nothing.

Because the inflationary nature of fiat, the censorship of payments, reliance on middlemen to carry out transactions locally and to other countries, civil asset forfeiture laws and structuring laws are all viewed as evils of the existing monetary system. 
Simply being *suspected* of committing a crime and walking around with cash allows the police to seize it with next to no hope of getting it back. Repeated deposits of cash under $10k allows the government to seize that money under structuring laws. Banks routinely close accounts for “business reasons” and force customers to wait weeks to get a check in the mail.
With Bitcoin you can be your own bank and spend your Bitcoin as you please with nothing on the protocol level to stop you. Your Bitcoin cannot be seized by anyone without them **getting your private keys from you**.

Just don’t get burned. I traded some LTC for alts last night and honestly thought my trades were decent. 
Traded some alts again tonight and somehow ended up with far less value going from one alt back to one I had yesterday. 
Rookie mistake I guess but damn it hurts to lose to $5 over a shitty trade. 
Guess I should just stick to HODLing.

For example, last night I sent a few bucks to my Lightning wallet; I didn’t check fees before hand and went with the fee Bitcoin Core client suggested. 24 hours later, even after RBF the transaction still hasn’t confirmed. 
The delays involved between Earth and Mars makes it hard to know the fee at all since it could have gone up or down in the time it takes to determine the fee (which is already old news by the time a Martian sees it). A Martian could set a transaction with a 1000sats/vbyte and by the time the transaction reaches Earth the fee to get a transaction confirmed quickly has doubled.
Yes Lightning or other second layers could help for local/interplanetary transactions by eliminating miners and block times from the equation, but there would still be delays for Lightning transactions going to Earth (which I don’t know if that would cause issues on Lightning or not).

You can still claim them but it’s risky to do so. 
You’d want to move your Bitcoins from the current seed on your hardware wallet to a new seed on the same hardware wallet. Once all your Bitcoin has been moved over to the new wallet seed, use the old seed in a wallet such as electrum so you can get the private keys associated with the addresses on the old seed. Or you can use the old seed with a multicoin wallet such as Coinomi. But whatever you do, move your Bitcoin to an entirely new seed before attempting to claim forks!
In my personal opinion it’s not really worth it at all; too many risks for coins that aren’t worth shit.

That just seems like a really odd point to decide whether something is an exchange or not when the core function of the exchange (exchanging one currency for another) is met.

You seem a bit worried about all of this. Did you invest money you could afford to lose?
Bitcoin is the long game. You will drive yourself bat shit crazy watching the price and feeling bad about it dropping.
Figure out what your time horizon is and just keep that in mind every time you look at the price. Add to your position when you can and feel like you can without worrying about it and go about your day. **Or** if it’s too much to handle sell and never look back. But whatever you do **own your decision**.

Bitcoin isn’t ethical or unethical. 
In actuality since the blockchain is public it’s largely more ethical than fiat since if you know an address is linked to crime you can avoid its bitcoins, unlike cash where you have no clue the provenance of it before accepting it.

But you could spend Bitcoin on goods, having a capital gain, then sell off enough of the shitcoins to zero out the gains with losses and rebuy Bitcoin to replace what was spent from the fiat gained from selling the shitcoins.

What is the buy price and fee you paid when you bought those coins. 
Remember when buying small amounts large gains in price won’t reflect much.
For example: 1.0 BTC at $7200 would equal an $800 gain at $8000.  0.1 BTC at $7200 (which costs $720) would only add $80 to the balance at $8000. 0.01 BTC would be $72 and would only gain $8.  This doesn’t factor in fees. 
So $50 (before fees) would equal 0.006944 BTC when bought at $7200 and that BTC at $8000 would be $55 (not accounting for fees).

Dollars are taxed when earned and on any interest earned on those dollars held in a bank account. It may also be taxed on buying goods or services on the state, county or local level depending on where you live. 
Forex is also taxed but it depends on how you invest in forex as to what tax scheme applies. 
People could use comics as currency and yet they would be taxed as property just the same as Bitcoin.

What would people be voting on if there wasn’t government?
Unfortunately government isn’t ever going to go away; if any nation decided to throw out its government and do without, any number of its adversaries would happily jump in, take over by force and install a government. If by some miracle such didn’t happen, it wouldn’t be very long before denizens of such ungoverned place installed one of their own making, because being truly free of government is dangerous for anyone without the means or capability of their own defense. And *voluntary associations* won’t be so voluntary when to do without such associations is a death sentence.

I just don’t see a point to this experiment. I don’t base my time’s value on expenditures and I don’t live off of Bitcoin; I live off fiat and accumulate Bitcoin and stocks with what I have left over.

I am no economist but I would imagine the following would happen:
People who are solvent and hold BTC would be just fine living off their savings in fiat. 
People who are not solvent and hold BTC would sell for living expenses. 
Those who sell for living expenses would cause the BTC price to drop impacting those who are holding. 
People wouldn’t have the money to invest in the dips causing further price erosion. 
BTC would price would decline until the economic prospects improve to buoy it up again.

While the fees don’t break the bank, paying dollars to move what once was $10 seems ridiculous, I guess I shouldn’t bother with this until fees come down or they give us the option to set them manually.

I understand that complaint; I had to dig through their support articles to see any mention of them charging premium (it was obvious looking at the price discrepancy between the rate on the app and the rate when buying) but they weren’t really up front with it as far as I am concerned (since it was buried in a support article). However, they are much faster than Coinbase. I have gone back to Coinbase because my new checking account’s debit didn’t work with Cash App; but waiting 14 days to take my Bitcoin annoys me; I don’t want them tied up there. 
Jack Dorsey, the founder of Square is a big supporter of Bitcoin and invested in Lightning Labs; so I’d much rather support Cash App than Coinbase given that.

Prices go up and down all the time. 
For example BTC was like 7900 at some points yesterday and there were pumps in BTG and BCH. BTC is back up to 8200 today and BTG is up to nearly 400.

Until Coinbase decides to make forked coins available to those who held Bitcoin with them, yes you missed out. 
However claiming forks is something that should be done with extreme care.  For one the wallet software of the forked coins could be malicious. Secondly, Bitcoin should be moved to a new, secure wallet **first** then forks claimed using the private keys from the old, empty wallet.

If we can change the protocol to add this idea, we can then change the idea after its added to make it less than 121 years. Then we can also change it to steal Satoshi’s stash since hey why not.

The private keys are what allow you to spend the coins on the address that is associated with it.  It should have the full balance on it as long as that Multibit transaction didn’t go through (which it appears is the case).   When you go to export the private key disconnect your internet so Multibit doesn’t inadvertently send the transaction anyway. 
If you export them the file containing them will allow you to move to another wallet. 
Once you have finished with the export and import you can delete the file once you have verified you have access to the coins. 
Just search google for guides on how to import into Electrum and make sure you get Electrum from the official site.

I used Bitcoin.tax to compile the list of my trades from all exchanges, either with API key or importing trades. It exports a file that works with tax software/online offerings. However the site I use to file my taxes always bitches about $0 cost basis and sales proceeds (which weren’t $0, but become such due to rounding, particularly for shit coins with sub penny valuations).  **Edit: which because I am glutton for punishment I reenter every value from the trades to ensure it rounds properly. I probably don’t have to do this.**
It’s more the tedium of having to do the legwork myself; but that tedium isn’t so extreme that it’s worth paying an accountant to do it.

How did you buy the coins?  With a CC or bank transfer?
Coinbase charges 1% for bank and 3% for CC on top of the 1.99 fee for BTC.
Just checking it out on my app the price listed on their main page is 8057. Buy with a CC and Bank transfer the price was 8097. 
Which is interesting because I don’t see where the fee difference between bank and CC is in that example.  
Secondly if you bought LTC with your bank account it may not have been delivered to your account yet and won’t reflect in your balance.

Unfortunately I don’t see that getting much better any time soon, as there seems to be heavy reluctance to winding down or whittling down government to its most necessary functions. 
But even then what would be the government’s most necessary functions? Defense certainly, but what else? Is there anything else? What about education for example? 
On the one hand many argue leaving it to the states/local governments is fine, keep the feds out of it. On the other hand, other nations play a large role in their education systems and to not have a national framework with which every state abides by leaves people and the nation at a disadvantage because advancements in technology, science, business, etc will be concentrated by the few here who get a good education and by the many elsewhere who get a good education. Eventually those nations will advance beyond us and will take full advantage of it if they are adversaries of ours. 
But such represents the issue with trying to make government leaner; everyone has their opinion and trying to find common ground isn’t easy or quick.

Until electricity can be paid for and priced in Bitcoin and taxes paid for in Bitcoin, dollars are necessary for any mining related activities. 
So regardless of one’s stance of earning dollars or Bitcoin, Bitcoin will have to be converted to dollars to pay the bills and taxes.

We’re all hoping to buy lower. But if you are like me and believe it will be worth a lot more 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from today, right now is substantially lower than what it will be then. 
So the best advice I can give you is to put in what you are comfortable with now and DCA the rest over time. Leaving some fiat on the sidelines to buy later allows you buy any dips that occur and buying some now allows you to have a seat at the table if the dip never happens. 
Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do tomorrow; we can make inferences based on history but whether that happens is another story.

If a whale has enough Bitcoin to make the market panic when they sell and FOMO when they buy why would they not exploit that to make even more money selling high, buying low, rinse and repeat?
For example if you have 1 Bitcoin, sell at $8500 and the market moves down to $7500 where you rebuy, it takes a little over 7 trades to double that Bitcoin assuming the same move up to $8500 and then move down to $7500 occurs repeatedly. If one is in the position to *make it happen* by their own actions they are essentially printing money.

I bought 0.08 BTC in 2014 converted 0.05 of it to LTC to buy Doge and deposited the remaining 0.03 in a MultiBit wallet. Passworded it and let it sit. 
A few months later I wanted to buy more BTC went to unlock my wallet and couldn’t. For the life of me I could not find the password. So I said to hell with it and never bothered. 
Fast forward to this year I saw the price approaching $6k and decided to go over every backup I had from then: I had backed up the goddamn wallet pre-password and now had my 0.03 BTC which I sold. I then traded in every last crypto I had into BTC and was nearly back where I started. 
Now I have spent like $300 buying in again various points, when I should have just held onto the coins I had from the beginning. 
This year is going to be a doozy for taxes. Thanks Uncle Sam for making it a major pain in the ass.

But Bitcoin has a number of properties that make it better than gold, especially if macro economics of *why* Bitcoin was created come to pass. 
Italy is talking about taxing money stored in safety deposit boxes. ECB talking negative rates. The Fed itching to lower rates. A Fed governor speaking rather lovingly of negative rates in the US. Venezuela, Iran, China’s slowing economy, etc. 
It would be near impossible to send or remove gold from those countries because either they will be seized on the way in or the way out. Or it can be seized for the hell of it, it’s physical, shiny and if the state surveillance apparatus keeps track of buyers and sellers it’s easy to just beat down their door.
And even in a country like the US moving around with any substantial amount of gold, especially at the borders is risky. And to boot who the hell accepts gold anyway? I’d wager there are more businesses accepting Bitcoin than gold. 
$1,000,000 per Bitcoin seems rather unthinkable, but when it was valued in tenths of a cent I’d imagine people thought $10,000 per Bitcoin was unthinkable as well. And perhaps we all get a major gut punch and Bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 because USD hyperinflated to crap and the economy tanked.

Bitcoin is decentralized and isn’t all that private thanks to the transparency of the blockchain. Because Bitcoin is decentralized anyone is **free to devise any ancillary services around it without any say so from anyone**. These ancillary services will live or die on their own merits. 
If you don’t like Coinbase don’t use them. 
While I dislike the idea of KYC/AML, Coinbase and Cash App allow people to buy Bitcoin instantly without having to jump through the hoops of dealing with P2P sellers, meeting people in public with cash or acquiring giftcards that can be sent over the internet. One is also trusting a seller won’t scam them in some way or won’t use any information gleaned from the transaction to snitch on buyers in the event the seller gets arrested for selling Bitcoin as an unlicensed Money Transmittal Business.

Stellar to Bitcoin = Taxable event; you owe taxes on any gains or can deduct losses. Bitcoin to Fiat = taxable event; you owe taxes on gains or can deduct losses. 
Bitcoin.tax is a great service for keeping track of crypto income, importing trades, getting the USD price (if you don’t manually put it in/it gets imported) at the time of trade and will provide closing position statements to help keep track of positions for tax purposes going forward into the next year. 
If you have a few transactions it’s free; after that you need to pay for premium.

Accumulate Bitcoin for 1 year, then spend them and use FIFO when filing taxes and you can take the long term capital gains rate which is 0-20% depending on income. As long as you never spend coins that are less than a year old you are ok, but yeah it still sucks because it basically amounts to double taxation regardless. 
Would be nice if Congress could get their heads out of their asses and give people an exemption for some level of Bitcoin spending, or just regard it as money and not tax it all except for income.

Paid in Bitcoin = Income. You get taxed for that income based on the dollar value of said coins when paid to you. Sell for cash, use Bitcoin to buy goods or services, trade for other crypto = taxable event; you pay taxes if your Bitcoin appreciated from when you were paid it, you get a deduction if it’s worth less than when you were paid it. 
This tax treatment makes using Bitcoin rather cumbersome.

Bitcoin isn’t private. While it does require somebody to know the *who* behind an address to be able to surveil it, this is trivial since most places you would interface with using Bitcoin will want to know who you are (either due to regulations or to simply provide you goods or services). 
It doesn’t create jobs all by itself; an unemployed HODLer won’t wake up with a job provided by Bitcoin. 
It doesn’t give you any rights back. What right has the government taken in your lifetime that you now have thanks to Bitcoin?

Even if only one person has the actual tools to decipher the hash into a useful image, they can still “get” node operators for downloading illegal content. 
While the court may disagree with the prosecutors, the impending confusion and the likely FUD the media will spin up may do lasting damage to Bitcoin since no one would want to risk running a full node in a country where legal prosecution *may be a possibility*.

I used it for my 2017 taxes. Made the task of getting all of my transactions from the exchange into a format for TaxAct really easy. 
The biggest issue I had was trades from Cryptopia not having the fees imported. So I had to go in and manually add them. 
The most time consuming aspect was ensuring all of the transactions were accurately imported, but I always double and triple check everything regarding taxes, so most of that was me being anal about it. 
What’s great is is that it will provide you a calculation of what the lowest tax burden is for a number of sale methods (FIFO, Average, Specific Lot, etc) and a closing position statement which gives you the number and cost basis of your remaining coins for 2018 taxes.

The biggest and probably best use for blockchain would be voting.  The application would run in its own sandbox on a voter’s PC and would require a variety of authentication (password, biometrics, etc) and once a ballot is cast it’s stored on the blockchain where it could never be altered after the fact.

Well you could treat that 0.10 as you would any gambling wager (it’s not income) on your tax return, but treat it as an inflow in Bitcoin.tax. 
The 0.50 would be treated the same way in Bitcoin.tax but on your return go in the section as gambling winnings. 
Bitcoin.tax will treat the crypto that’s traded or spent by whichever sale method you choose.  It *should* do all the leg work for you in that respect.

How does Bitcoin make any difference with starting a business?  It doesn’t absolve you of your state’s (if you live in the US) business registration requirements, insurance and licensure. Bitcoin changes none of that. 
Yes certain business ventures require capital or proof of skill/knowledge (construction, plumbing, medicine, law) but bitcoin doesn’t change that. At best Bitcoin makes it easier to trade with foreign companies so you can import their goods, but by and large any requirements on a business venture getting started legitimately are still there even with Bitcoin.

Banks won’t deal with people who have horrible credit. Also if someone had an account and it was closed for overdraft and not paying they will be put into ChexSystems and no other bank will deal with them, regardless of said person rectifying things. 
Same thing for someone who accepted a bad check and deposited it. 
ChexSystems is one the least known reporting agencies out there and yet they have the ability to ban you from every bank in the country who uses them.

There are slightly above 1 million homeless people in the US, which while it is a problem, it’s not as widespread as you make it sound out of a population of 330 million. 
Secondly while slightly above 50% of Americans don’t pay income taxes, which is likely a proxy for poverty since many of those people wouldn’t make enough to be taxed in the first place, poverty isn’t an entirely government created problem and it isn’t one that would go away with deflationary currency; in fact it would likely get much worse. 
Poverty is a multifaceted issue that can’t be whittled down to just monetary policy and the collection of government benefits and the existence of benefits cliffs (losing benefits for a marginal increase in income) disincentives people who accept welfare, food stamps, housing assistance and Medicare from going out and getting a good paying job because they very well may not be able to afford the same standard of living they are accustomed to.

But blockchain for business doesn’t have to be “decentralized” to the extent that bitcoin is.

The decision making structure of the Federal Reserve wasn’t concentrated within the Federal Reserve Board in DC, but rather spread across all of the districts, with those districts having power to affect change for their district and for the nation as a whole if the districts could reach consensus.The Federal Reserve Board in DC could do almost nothing without getting consensus, which was difficult as the Governors all had their own ideas as to what would be effective.

Yet stocks can trade below their intrinsic value. 
Perhaps you are right about new money coming in. But the ecosystem is growing on the services end (Robinhood is bringing crypto trading online in the near future) and if the government imposes reasonable regulations, that may end up being a good thing for cryptocurrency overall. I suspect the government will go the light touch route simply because it will cause economic harm to impose overly harsh regulations (such as a ban). 
Even if it does tank 0, it’s little skin off my back. It’s a tiny percentage of my overall portfolio.

Ownership regarding Bitcoin is your ability to spend coins in your possession. Without the private keys you cannot spend Bitcoin. 
However if anyone else gets those keys they also “own” those Bitcoins. 
It is analogous to cash: if it’s in your wallet in your possession you own it; if your wallet gets stolen or lost, whoever stole it/finds it owns the cash in it.

Well savings would be 3-6 months of expenses at a minimum + any savings for short term goals (vacation fund, house fund). 
Retirement savings should be 10-20% of income at the very least. 10% properly invested would yield a livable retirement, whereas 20% would yield a very comfortable retirement. 
But this depends on how much one expects to need in retirement and how much one already has saved for retirement.

Doesn’t matter what its point was. The government says its property and taxes it as such. 
If you want crypto to remain “free enough” play by the rules. Because the alternative is treating exchanges like every other bank in the US: compulsory tax records of all customers sent to the IRS annually amongst whatever other regulations the government can cook up (which are innumerable). 
And you do you anyway. When the IRS finds out you will pay dearly (and they will find out eventually).

You could run 1 node and it would be more efficient, but if you were running at least 2 you would have data redundancy without relying entirely on traditional backups and have regulatory compliance as the data would be harder to change after the fact (unless said implementation was made to get around that). 
However the benefit of blockchain and having multiple nodes is immutability, something that is important to regulators and vendors (as they can trust the blockchain spread amongst many vs a centralized database held by one). 
For example that supply chain blockchain I mentioned in my last post, if it dealt with agriculture and the USDA could monitor the blockchain in real time and it was spread amongst a number of participants in the network (farmers, shippers and stores) they could track down potentially contaminated produce very quickly without the potential for a company trying to cover its tracks by fudging data. 
Perhaps there are solutions to this already not relying on blockchain that are better and I am just unaware. But given that a few businesses have been adopting blockchain technology there must be some value add to their business (for those who weren’t trying to capitalize on the hype).

Bitcoin.tax will pull up the price of BTC as its entered into the software effective on the date of the Income, Spend, Gift, Trade, etc. You can also enter in the prices manually. 
And it will handle a variety of tax sale methods (FIFO, Average, Specific Lot, etc) and will calculate what the lowest tax method of sale is. 
I would imagine you would enter in these new lots as income and it should take care of the rest. It will also provide you a closing position statement so you know what coins you have left and at what cost basis going into 2018. 
I did FIFO since it what’s Coinbase uses when selling on there and I did so to keep it consistent. I didn’t try average cost basis method in Bitcoin.tax but the option is there. Ensure you have all of your trades, income, etc entered in then choose Average Cost basis on the Calculate tab, Lock the forms and Export.

Not an expert but: The government can impose regulations on Bitcoin. There is no disputing that they can. 
The difference lies in *are those regulations successful* and *do those regulations work as intended*(either as stated or in some underhanded way)?
For example KYC/AML on all businesses accepting, trading and exchanging BTC for money will mostly work for the businesses that already follow the laws. Not so much for those that don’t. 
Criminalizing BTC for example would stop all out of the shadows use of it (so exchanges go out in that country, legal users dump it, whales living in said country either dump it or just leave said country, etc) but have 0 impact on its use amongst those who were already flouting the law (and now makes a whole new class of illegal users for those who continue to use it). 
Treating cryptocurrency as property, while the correct course given the current laws (since there are no specialized regulations or laws changing it currently in the US), has likely had a chilling effect on mass adoption since most law abiding citizens wouldn’t want the tax headache such treatment brings.

Secondly cashless would make it possible for the banks/Fed to have total control over one’s money; thankfully we have cryptocurrency and non-bank depositories out there as a hedge for the banks/Fed should things like negative interest ever be implemented. (Although I imagine non-bank depositories would likely impose them as well).

Yobit gave BTC holders equal BTG once the block of the fork was mined.

Sure that could be done, until converting to fiat. Then I suppose one could simply ignore having to pay taxes on it or perhaps such transfers would adjust the cost basis each hop, since I doubt the IRS is going to dig too deep into it (they could of course).

Making cash deposits less than than $10k repeatedly is a crime and it’s called structuring. When cash deposits totaling $10k are made the bank is required to fill out paperwork. Sub $10k they aren’t required to do this, but because it’s assumed that repeated sub $10k deposits are done to **avoid the scrutiny of the bank** it’s deemed a crime (whether you are doing so to avoid the SAR filing or not). 
Whether this applies to crypto currency is beyond me, but I would simply deposit it in total to avoid any suspicion that I am attempting to structure.

Stop trusting third party mixers. There is good chance they may be scams. 
Instead take your BTC, send it to an exchange where you don’t have to verify if using only crypto, get Monero.  Send that Monero to another exchange that doesn’t require verification for crypto trades, trade back into BTC and put into a new wallet. 
Most exchanges use one or multiple BTC addresses for all consumer deposits and the balances and trades are accounted for internally; basically a massive coin mixer in and of itself.

Automation isn’t remotely close to the automobile putting horse and carriage operators out of business. 
Experts believe automation will open up many new job opportunities, more than those lost from it, but I seriously doubt that; and even then, the jobs that do remain because they cannot be easily automated there will be a race to the bottom in terms of wages since anyone displaced will attempt to get those few remaining jobs. 
Eventually the AI and machines will become so reliable that they will rarely need a human to fix them and with AI encroaching more and more on human creative endeavors (programming, writing, etc) we may reach a point where a human isn’t even necessary to create a machine and AI to do a task. (Google intends to sell in the near future a self-programming, deep learning neural network deployment to companies, removing the need of those companies from having to hire AI engineers.)

The issue I have grappled with in all of this is if this ruinous collapse doesn’t happen then what?  I have exposed myself to either significant taxation risk in the future or I have money that hasn’t done anything for me in all of that time. 
Retirement accounts are already woefully underfunded in the US and I don’t intend to be one of them. You can’t borrow for retirement. 
If the entire system collapses then we will have much bigger problems to contend with. 
So where does that leave the common person? Go all in on Bitcoin and get fucked by the IRS daily? Find some happy medium and hope the shit doesn’t hit the fan?  Or sit on the sidelines with everything else and acquire Bitcoin here and there hoping appreciation outpaces the inflation of the money sitting under the mattress?
My wife won’t go all in Bitcoin because paying with it for most things is a multi step hassle (since so few places accept it natively, such as Insurance company, utilities, phone company, etc) and then every transaction has tax implications and paperwork associated with it.

Your coins are far more likely to be either stolen or seized on an exchange than in your own possession.

Futures aren’t for the common retail investors. There is a learning curve and a bit more “activity” involved than simply buy and hold like an ETF. 
Futures is more akin to gambling: you bet on whether the price will be up or down at some specific point in the future. 
While most everyone *bets* an ETF will be worth more *in the future* by buying it and holding it, futures aren’t so nebulous in that respect because you have to pick a time frame for when your bet will be in the money.

I am not certain of the exact terminology but because the way the fork is occurring you will have your BTC address with whatever coins were in it and after the fork you would you have your BTC address and the same B2X address with the same coin balance as the BTC address.

Not directly related. Futures require a long for every short. So they essentially zero out (so you can’t even gauge sentiment from them). 
Where they become tricky is that since CBOE and CME futures are cash settled, one can play two markets at once: a whale BTC holder can take short positions with cash, sell their stack before options expiry and profit on the downward price trajectory if they have enough BTC to move the price down. The same can done for moving upwards too (take a long position then buy a boatload of BTC before expiry).

How do you build a decentralized production system?
The equipment has to be housed somewhere. Powered somehow. People have to maintain it, ensure QA. Who gets first dibs at a production run that will take up an entire day’s worth of production time? 
What machines comprise this decentralized production facility? Because a great number of machines are designed for a specific task and aren’t easily re-specified without extra investment of time and materials. 
Distribution can be decentralized a bit more easily, but even then not everyone has access to a barge or 18 wheeler. 
And the beauty of our economic system is that centralization have made it possible for massive productivity gains by meticulously planning how, when and where things move through the system. Decentralization will undo most of those gains because it’s not efficient.

Well according to some on here, credit would die under the Bitcoin standard which is good in their eyes, if you can’t pay for it in full you have no right to own it.   
But then, according them, under that system everything you would buy with credit would reduce in cost exponentially since easy money is no longer available; nevermind that real estate is much like bitcoin in some respects: limited supply and an ever growing user base...
Eventually, in the future that one house with an acre lot in a city full of high rise apartments will be so much more valuable than it is today, regardless of the availability of credit, either as that one house with a yard or as an acre of developable land.

If “original” BTC developed ASIC resistance, Ver and Wu would mine “original” BTC up until the fork where “original” BTC then becomes “original” BTC.ASIC 
_resistance; but since the ASIC hashpower will obliterate the GPU hashpower BTC.ASIC_resistance will become a shitcoin and the non ASIC resistant chain (now fully supported by Ver and Wu) will become the “new” Bitcoin. 
In other words, to put it bluntly, Bitcoin as we know and love will be entirely subsumed by our enemies if we attempt to develop ASIC resistance.
We need more players in the mining space to combat Bitmain, not a PoW change.

Buy GBTC in a Roth IRA and you never have to pay taxes on the gains. (*Assuming you can buy OTC stocks in your Roth). 
If you buy BTC you would (unless you decide not to report it) until the IRS decides to treat BTC differently (unlikely given its meteoric rise).

It’s not from a limited imagination; it’s the fact that we lived through an era like that once before and we know damn well it wasn’t good for anyone except the 1%. 
You honestly think a company who paid for college in such a society would allow the employee to ever leave?  And unsurprisingly the worker in your scenario may end up paying more for the education than he/she would under the old system depending on whether the school was in state and not an Ivy League. 
The median salary for a Chemical Engineer out of college is $74,000. With 2-4 years of experience the median pay is $85,000 and with 4-7 years experience the median pay is $102,000. So for the first two years their education cost them $39,000 a year, the third year $50,000, the fourth year $15,000 for a total of $142,000. Most run of the mill colleges across the country charge below $30,000 a year for in state tuition (some **well** below that). 
And what happens if the person can’t hack it? They are now indebted to a company for the time spent going to this school (because the school wants their money day 1). 
But here’s the solution to that problem: company owned schools. Yet this presents another wrinkle: the student/future worker is now learning trade secrets thus said student/future worker will be **compelled** as a condition of attending to never attend the school of a competitor, thus limiting the job and school prospects. The condition will likely continue well into an employee’s tenure, if not indefinitely. And since the employee can never leave to perform that job elsewhere, wages will drop considerably than where they sit now. 
Then, since credit isn’t available and wages have depressed no one can own a home. And **no one** who owns a home and would be inclined to sell will sell it for less than what they paid for it, regardless of what people *think* may happen to home values in the Bitcoin, no credit economy. They will hodl til death if need be. 
So now the companies themselves have to get involved as the landlord since their workers need a place to live close by. So they may very well pay what the sellers want for the home, and since they will collect rent on said homes forever deducted from employee wages, it’s an amazing value proposition to them.
And this doesn’t even scratch the surface of what a lack of credit will do to the economy as a whole; we may very well lose over half the jobs this country has simply because no one will buy anything outside of an absolute necessity.  Is the internet really all that necessary if someone has to choose between rent and internet? Netflix sure as shit won’t be, which requires internet anyway so kill two birds with one stone there.

Lastly Nicehash and Minergate are two mining pools that make it easy to get started but Minergate is usually frowned upon by some in the mining community becaus (I believe) their software is closed source (I haven’t checked on that in a while, it may have changed). 
Do your own due diligence on any mining programs you use; ensure they are open source, reputable within the community and you are getting them **only** from the actual developer.

That’s the only reason I want an ETF. I will keep buying Bitcoin as I do now, but I could effortlessly move money within retirement accounts to a Bitcoin ETF if one is available. 
Some here thinks it’s a bad idea because “not your keys not your bitcoin”, but I feel like a long time institution at the helm will allay some of these concerns, especially if they have robust cold storage methods (multisig, airgapped computers, etc)

Hedge funds can buy ICOs in the US being that they are accredited investors (and so can individual accredited investors). 
I don’t think institutions are staying away from crypto because of legality per se; I think it has more to do with a lack of regulations (and knowing *what* those might entail if they ever become reality) or existing traditional institutions in the space. If any large, reputable, long existence company was involved in the space (Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, JP Morgan, etc) other institutions would feel *safer* getting involved.

Holding Bitcoin is using it, both as a store of value and protecting oneself from government overreach. The government cannot take someone’s Bitcoin, held in that person’s custody, without bothering them about it first; unlike money in the bank or Bitcoin held in custody of regulated exchanges where all the government has to do is demand it from them. 
And for what it’s worth the same “buy and hold” mantra is espoused by both stock investors and real estate investors because its the most reliable way to make a consistent return. **Time in the market beats timing the market**.

PayPal is instantaneous. Cashing out of PayPal takes time but so does cashing out BTC for fiat on an exchange. 
Bitcoin certainly had a role when it came out and still does generally, but PayPal and now P2P payments from banks have largely eliminated much of Bitcoin's money transmission benefits.

Because the government printed more dollars than there was gold to back it. So even on the gold standard the government still adopted inflationary policies. 
And once the US dropped the gold standard, gold prices nearly tripled and the economy began growing more so than before. 
So once again the gold standard is a farce that is damaging to the economy, just like it was during the Great Depression. 
The one common thread in the last 80 years that led to the massive growth in wealth of the US is: inflationary monetary policy. So why would anyone in this day and age living from the veritable fruits of said policy rail against it?
Buy and hold stocks, TIPS, real estate, gold, and bitcoin if you want inflation protection.

Through bitcoin usage is entirely different than that information being stored natively on the blockchain. 
There is 0 personal information stored on the blockchain. If I buy something using my BTC wallet and have it shipped to my house the **merchant** knows who I am and can associate that with my BTC wallet address, and can make inferences based on other addresses I have moved funds to; but without that merchant spilling the beans to someone else (Amazon in the case of this patent) know one else knows that I am associated with that wallet address.

It won’t be added to Bitcoin, but would instead ask merchants to provide data about cryptocurrency users. 
Once you have a name and an address associated with a Bitcoin address you can easily search the blockchain for prior transactions and future ones and make an inference to who owns what. 
For example: I sent BTC from Coinbase to my Ledger. Coinbase now knows that address is one that is associated with me in some way.  If I spend from that address to buy a T-shirt and Amazon gets that information, they can get the data from Coinbase and be rest assured that that’s my wallet. 
Then Amazon can watch where all of my coins go from that address and couple that with other data sources and know pretty much everything I am up to.

Personally I think the “death” of the American Dream can’t simply be whittled down to just monetary policy. 
The globalization trend over the last 50 years has done its part (while also adding new opportunities) and stagnating wages and rising wealth inequality. 
Bitcoin could help from the monetary policy aspect of the equation (however much or little that contributes to the problem) but Bitcoin likely won’t change anything regarding the wage stagnation or loss of jobs due to outsourcing (or automation down the road).

Yes it would be. But the cost of fees may hamper that.
In the US a $0.12 fee is nothing. A few dollar fee is nothing. 
But to someone in a country with a failing currency, where Bitcoin is their literal savior, that $0.12 fee may be the equivalent of a quarter day’s wage when priced in USD. 
Of course they may just suck it up because there is no alternative, but those who need Bitcoin the most (because their local currency is shit) are disproportionately impacted by the fees. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:36:38
They could though if they wanted to. They are a bank so KYC/AML is already there on their end. I’d imagine it would be trivial for them to get registered as a money transmitter (if they aren’t already, which they probably are if they deal currency exchange). 
They could easily add the option to buy/sell bitcoin and use Chase Pay to enable transactions with merchants who support it. And collect fees all the way around. 
Sure they wouldn’t be the only game in town, but they’d still capture some of the market, especially from the newbies.

Businesses have intrinsic value. Basically assets - liabilities at its very core.

It wouldn’t, because the last person to buy BTC with fiat at $300,000 isn’t parting with it for anything less than $300,000 worth of goods or services. 
And at that point, many goods and services would have already begin pricing in BTC, hence fiat’s irrelevance.

Coinbase is probably among the safest of exchanges given how big they are, that your cryptos are insured and the like, but having the coins in your possession is the safest way to keep them if you are diligent with your own security.

If it was such a great system why is the fiat monetary system used by most of the world?  Surely at some point, some government somewhere would have said fuck fiat and tried gold again, yet none do. 
Don’t you happen to think that’s because deflationary policies are an abysmal failure?

Isn’t *real property*. It is property though. 
Although the new tax law forbids 1031 on anything but real property, the old laws didn’t **outright** forbid 1031 on crypto, despite **never** applying in practice since no crypto is like kind to another. 
But I have never seen anyone argue that trading into the same coin shouldn’t work, but I imagine the IRS wouldn’t let it fly since the “same thing” isn’t “like-kind”. 
The IRS rules regarding real estate is so liberally applied that it’s almost meaningless; yet all other potential 1031 vectors (before the new tax law) they are so strict that it’s almost impossible to get.

It’s better to simply buy Bitcoin. Miners are expensive, electricity isn’t cheap enough in most places and the difficulty is ever increasing, making miners obsolete quickly.

Unless this poster means diversification through investing in assets separate from Bitcoin (stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, etc) don’t listen to it. 
There *may be* huge upside to some altcoins and even shitcoins, but Bitcoin is king and where it goes the others usually follow. 
I bought some Bitcoin in 2014; I nearly had an entire coin and traded most of it into Dogecoin. I’d be a lot better off had I held on to Bitcoin. Truth is I got roped into the “fun” of the community and the good works it was doing. And while hindsight is 20/20 holding and even accumulating more Bitcoin then would have been far more life changing. 
Aside from 2017 when I got back into crypto I had not purchased any more from 2014 to 2017.
Chasing yield on penny cryptos seems enticing; you can get a ton of coins for cheap and if it goes up as much as Bitcoin has you’ll be sitting on life changing wealth; but it’s a huge gamble and ultimately you may end up losing. 
All the news swirling around about big institutions getting involved in crypto usually pertains to just Bitcoin. And where do you think it’s price will be when that happens or when a Bitcoin ETF gets green lit by the SEC?

If you have skills that others may want to pay you for then you can do those things for Bitcoin.

Depending on where you are you may be able to give plasma for money or sperm/eggs assuming you are young and healthy and could live with the fact that you may have biological children running around that aren’t yours. 
But really, depending on where you are, your age and your existing skills (if you have any) you should really think about either going to school (college or trade school) or finding a job that would teach you a valuable skill (union trade jobs come with apprenticeship programs). With a job you could use Bitwage to convert salary into Bitcoin or just have regular purchases of Bitcoin on Coinbase/Cash App from your bank account/debit card.

Amazon and FB coins would certainly see large adoption in the short term, there is no doubt about that; but they would offer none of the benefits Bitcoin offers: decentralized, permissionless, censorship resistant and sound money principles. 
If Amazon or FB doesn’t like anything you do, regardless of whether you use their platforms to conduct such activities they can deplatform you and take their coins away from you. So while Joe and Jane Schmoe may not have any issue with that occurring to certain people because “that’s some crazy {insert political/conspiracy/hate group name here} I have nothing to worry about”, they should be worried because by the time Amazon and FB come for them there will be no one left to defend them. 
Bitcoin doesn’t allow that to happen on the protocol level (although business entities, such as Coinbase, servicing Bitcoin can and do that to those who have been deplatformed by Amazon, FB, Paypal, Patreon, Twitter, etc).

If the exchanges would enable Lightning we’d be better off. People trying to capture arbitrage opportunities wouldn’t be clogging the mempool. People who wanted to spend their coins immediately could do so at LN enabled businesses, without clogging the mempool. Users having access to coins immediately available on LN could send to family and friends without clogging the mempool. 
Leaving only the transactions that can’t be done on LN on the base layer. At some point there will be an on chain TX when people take coins on and off LN but they could at least spend or send elsewhere on LN until the mempool clears. 
So what can we do? Tell exchanges to get on board with LN. Tell businesses that accept crypto to offer LN payments as an option. Tell friends who have Bitcoin to setup an LN node and wallet.

Looking at dollar amounts is not really the best way to gauge investment performance. It’s better to use percentages because you can quickly compare that to the percentage return on other investments to determine what’s better. For example the stock market has returned on average 7% per year over the last 50 years. Real estate investors want better than that 7% so they target at a 10+ on cash return. Why? Because if it’s 7% or less they’d be better off investing in stocks so why tie up funds in a less liquid asset to earn less money over time?
Bitcoin has gone up over 100% this year so far. 
But why are dollar amounts meaningless essentially? Because the less you put the less dollars you make even if the percentage is as large as Bitcoin’s price growth was this year. For example $5 of ₿ (ignoring fees/premium) at $3000 is only $10 at $6000; doesn’t seem like much but where else would you have doubled your money in an investment over such a short period of time?

Problem is biometrics are rather useless as a last line of defense (arguably useless as a first line too in some respects). You leave fingerprints and DNA **everywhere**.

Sure it would suck to spend a day having to go to two locations to get the keys to spend money from savings but at least if any dbags try to take money from you, you feign ignorance and hand them the hot wallet.

A Bitcoin exchange can very easily setup fractional reserve of Bitcoin without any say so from anyone since there are no laws that say otherwise with respect to Bitcoin.
Take Robinhood as an example; you can’t withdraw coins from them at all so how does anyone know whether the coins their customers buy actually exist? They could exist on paper entirely and no one would have a clue. 
An exchange could easily do similar with actual Bitcoin; holding only 50% of Bitcoin on the exchange knowing damn well traders won’t take possession of them in the short term.  It won’t become a problem until everyone wants to withdraw their coins and the exchange doesn’t have them.

The “Prime Directive” of Bitcoin is being your own bank. That comes with great responsibility as **you** are responsible for making it impossible for anyone to enter the vault.

I don’t think it’s so much the short term investment period; it’s asking a basic mathematical question that anyone considering investing in Bitcoin, or anything else for that matter, should already know how to solve. 
Understanding Bitcoin and properly storing Bitcoin requires a fair degree of research and some understanding of good personal and digital operational security; it wouldn’t be out of line to assume someone asking such a simple question has no clue whatsoever about the more advanced concepts involved with cryptocurrencies. And while we as a community shouldn’t be *malicious* about it we should certainly tell such people to steer clear until they do understand these things.

You could have also sold for USD on Coinbase. 
Robinhood gets no love around here because there is no proof you are actually buying Bitcoin because you can’t withdraw it. And for better or worse, being your own bank is the primary reason to own Bitcoin. Some people aren’t capable of that as it takes a fair amount of good operational security which most average people don’t have whatsoever. But even then the lesser evil compared to Robinhood would be Coinbase, who will provide custody for you and your coins when you so desire them. 
It begs the question; if Robinhood is truly buying Bitcoin on behalf of clients, why aren’t they making them available for withdrawal? For a company like them and the nature of their business it’s trivial to do KYC/AML and register as a Money Services Business.

I just sold all my BAT from Coinbase Earn (as well as Stellar, ZEC and 0x)for Bitcoin the other day. Which is great because when I got BAT it was $10 worth, sold them for $30. Also sold half my ETH for BTC as well. 
Now my holdings are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero and Dogecoin. 
Could BAT have gone higher? Probably, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and I’d rather own Bitcoin.

Being born during a recession is a lot different than what we have now. Hardly anyone knew of Bitcoin when it came out and buying and selling it wasn’t anywhere near as easy as it is today. 
How the central banks/government respond to the recession is what will ultimately decide whether its “sold for hard times” or “bought for sound money”. 
If we just chug along and rates go a bit lower, banks stay afloat then Bitcoin may very well be sold to live. If we see bail-ins and negative rates it could moon as anyone with any sense realize cash in the bank literally (and noticeably) loses money every day it sits there and those who get roped into the bail in scheme flock to new banks (assuming they have a job) to get the hell out of the fiat game via the likes of Coinbase/Cash App/Bitwage fearing that bank will get bailed-in as well.

Cash App is from Square. Sign up and put in your debit card you can buy Bitcoin instantly. To withdraw you need to scan your license. Their premium is a bit higher than Coinbase but they are a solid choice to get ₿. 
Cash App can also be used like Paypal to send money P2P and you can a get debit card and load boosts which are discounts/cash back when used at certain places.

The problem is businesses agreeing to this would go belly up during the next bull run which wouldn’t help adoption or they’d find some way out of the contract (possibly depends how it’s written and if judge/jury agrees) and piss off those employees possibly hurting adoption. 
We get adoption by growing the user base of individuals and businesses by appealing to the aspects of Bitcoin that are desirable. For businesses this may be firing their payment processor who takes a cut of every sale, speeding up payments to and from international vendors/clients, not dealing with chargebacks anymore where they end up losing despite doing their best effort to make the customer whole, etc.

Problem is they will see all of the good things FBcoin can do (instant payments, tiny/no fees, acceptance everywhere) and they will look at Bitcoin as being technology from the bygone era without ever considering what makes it truly valuable. 
Couple that with the notion that people will get paid to view ads on the site and you have a situation that will make FB addiction even worse. Why spend time researching Bitcoin when that time could be converted into money by simply going to FB?
And the centralized (I guarantee it will be centralized entirely) nature of the coin will completely eliminate any need for personal responsibility, making it “the better choice” for anyone too dumb to use Bitcoin.

That’s another issue I have come across though; I have a “fire” (which I am now questioning that too...) safe which is relatively easy to move by a person. In my mind that means it’s easy to steal and I am sure there are easy ways to crack it open. While the likelihood they find the safe is low (it’s well hidden and buried under a bunch of other things/boxes and there are a number of more valuable items in plain view such as TV, consoles, PCs) it’s still a concern in my mind. 
One could go the extra mile with digital security to prevent loss of funds via hacks/malware, but it may end up being all naught if personal/home security is weak and a burglar simply steals wherever the seed is stored.

It’s arguably easier to become unbanked in a country that isn’t hostile to Bitcoin; wages can be paid in Bitcoin via Bitwage, bills can be paid with Bitcoin via other services and going in and out of fiat by way of trading Bitcoin is another option for times when Bitcoin can’t be used for a particular transaction. 
The situation in India is why having Bitcoin is important, but tearing down the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrency users transitioning out of fiat makes it pretty hard to use Bitcoin for living expenses, especially if certain bills *need* to be paid via traditional banking methods (checks, bank transfers, etc). 
For example, would a landlord in India accept Bitcoin if there no easy way of selling some of it for expenses that must be paid via bank transfers? Would the power company accept Bitcoin given the same limitations?

You can print paper wallets for most cryptocurrencies. 
There are security and life cycle concerns for them that make them less than ideal. They should be printed on a printer that isn’t internet accessible and on a computer that has never been connected to the internet. Also the choice of paper and ink should consider the length of storage.

When did you start putting away $300 a week? We’ve had 21 weeks so far. That’s $6300. 
It was $3823 on January 1st and didn’t go far above and sustain a price above $4000 until March 30th. That’s 12 weeks. If you were actually buying Bitcoin all that time (for the sake of easy math let’s just say the price was $4000 for that entire period) you’d be buying 0.075 ₿ every week for 12 weeks giving you 0.9 ₿ at the end of March. (In reality you’d have more since the price wasn’t $4000 that entire period). 
If you weren’t buying the asset each week with that $300 you weren’t DCAing; if you were saving it on the sidelines hoping to invest later you are lump sum investing.

I just don’t particularly care for gold all that much. I don’t have the capability to store $1 million worth of gold so I’d be putting my trust in someone else. If I wanted to store it myself it’d probably cost $1 million just to build a vault, find land and develop it to do so. 
I can store $1 million worth of Bitcoin on a piece of paper (granted I’d up my physical security substantially at that point) and nobody could take it away on a whim or seize it without getting access to where I keep that paper.

Thing of it is insurance on cash deposits, while a lot on paper, is essentially a myth; the FDIC only has enough cash on its books to payout 10% of all deposits across the entire US. So if all banks failed at the same time they couldn’t cover pretty much anyone without Congress authorizing a massive appropriation for the shortfall. 
While there are exchanges that offer insurance many, very likely, only cover what was lost in fiat terms; so if you bought $50 worth of Bitcoin that in 2020 ends up being worth $50,000 too bad so sad they hand you $50 and call it a day because they simply cannot turn around and pay out that day’s Bitcoin value to everyone and remain solvent. 
On the other hand an exchange that wanted to keep a 1:1 reserve of Bitcoin to customer deposits would need to buy Bitcoin every time their customer does; where would they get this money from? High premiums.
And lastly, while companies could technically find work arounds to this problem now, we shouldn’t get used to it, because if Bitcoin ends up being the king of the hill of currencies (supplanting fiat) it can’t be printed on demand to make people whole easily; so if you lose 1 Bitcoin at that time you’ll very likely end up having to earn it again because no insurance company will just hand it over when they have too have to earn it the hard way.

I know and understand what the 24 word seeds are. The 24+passphrase makes it so having the 24 words isn’t enough since the wallets were generated using 24 words + the passphrase; ideally the passphrase would be kept geographically separate from the 24 words (or just remembered, despite the fallibility of human memory) so anyone finding those words wouldn’t be able to generate the wallet with funds (or bulk of funds) on it. 
On the one hand, 24+passphrase makes it easy to leave the 24 words in a less secure manner (such as in a small safe) since the passphrase is what ultimately matters, on the other hand losing or forgetting that passphrase essentially burns all those coins.

Thanks for the link. Of course it leaves with more questions, such as storing such a passphrase. That site recommends memorization and writing it down, but writing it down leaves me with the same issue; my safe can easily be stolen since it’s not all that heavy and even so I’d have even bigger problems than just my Bitcoin/crypto (since all my important documents are in there). And memorization concerns me because I thought I could remember the password to an electrum wallet in 2014; until I couldn’t. 
Pretty ironic how Bitcoin was designed to put the middle finger up to the banks, yet the bank vault would be safer than most options for secure storage that consumers could reasonably afford. 
Guess I have a lot more reading to do to figure out the best way to handle this.

The current welfare system disincentivizes work because of the benefits cliff; for every X dollar increase in annual income there is a Y multiple reduction in benefits that said X increase isn’t enough to offset.

I would find a way if I found myself in that situation, but the problem is, how much short term pain can the banks inflict if they find out? Like could the landlord be debanked and have the mortgage for the property terminated and be foreclosed for accepting Bitcoin?
Long term I see Bitcoin being insanely valuable, but these soft bans are particularly evil: the government doesn’t have the balls to outright criminalize it (and deal with the blowback of jailing those who use it) yet has no issue cutting off people at the knees and being subjected to whatever consequences come with that. 
I don’t know how people are paid in India, but in the US checks/direct deposit is the norm and those who are unbanked get raked over the coals with services geared towards to them via fees for use (wannabe “bank” cards, check cashing services, etc). But at least if they wanted to they could setup Bitwage and get out of that bullshit and in the long run they’d be better off doing that.

Why do you keep making this false assertion? Anyone interested in buying BTC will look at whatever exchange they can buy it from. 
For someone already entrenched in the ecosystem, why would they look up the price at Coinmarketcap, when they can go right to their favorite exchange and see the price **they will actually pay** the moment they decide to buy?
