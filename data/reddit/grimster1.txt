I think he meant that a web wallet would be more secure than a hot wallet on your smartphone or pc.  How I understood it: hot wallet &lt; web wallet &lt; cold storage

paper wallets are about as cheap as you can get.

It's always been a thing

thats pretty neat.  I did use the coinbase app on my phone to make the purchase.  I'll look into that auto-rebuy thing.

Just bought the book using bitcoin.  it's going to be a long 2 month wait.....
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:08:54
well when I say "low-level" format I mean running kill disk and "zero filling" the drive.  
bitaddress should be ok (i would think) , but i do see your point.  
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:33:42
explain this "year over year" thing you are talking about...
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:59:00
well I can't speak for others, but I spent around 0.8 BTC at newegg and 1.2 BTC at provident metals. Not bad for my first bitcoin black friday :)  (I didnt get into this craziness until around January 2014)

Whoa whoa whoa....personal life aside...how do you find time to eat?
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:03:17
but still....this article isn't bitcoin related.  news?  yes.  bitcoin news?  no
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:00:05
Wow a lot of haters here.  Do people just troll every post in this subreddit and blast anyone who has something positive to say?
  
@_date: 2014-09-07 19:53:14
real question is...how much did it cost to secure the value of your $2 Canadian bill?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:08:13
sounds like someone bought into bitcoin at $1100 and is still butthurt over it....
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:16:27
How is this an issue with bitcoin?  when someone has their bank of america account hacked (for example)...you don't see them bitching and moaning that the USD is a crap currency.  You see that as an issue with BOA's system or whatever device the customer used to access their account.

This is going to come across as me sounding like a dick - why is it my responsibility?

It's only an issue when you try to only move a portion of the coins off a paper wallet.  I agree with you it's much easier (and less stressful) if you just wipe the balance completely into your hot wallet when you want to use it.  That's how I've always done it.  I treat the paper wallets as a one-time-use thing.

i print mine on normal paper with a normal (offline) inkjet printer.  then i just cut them down to size and put them in those toploader holders that people use to collect currency notes.  then those just sit in my safe.  so far so good

Ask your parents or guardian.  They should be able to help you.

I did too, but I got my order and even have it dedicated and autographed.  You should probably contact them since you've never received it.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:43:13
which exchange would you suggest this is accomplished on?  I have only tried cryptsy in the past and I was not impressed with how "fast" the transactions took place.  Took several hours to get my BTC back out....
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:46:35
Wouldn't an easy way to do this be to use a circle account?  Just deposit the btc...then withdraw once you have x number of confirmations?  
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:24:57
no taxes on an ebay or paypal business?  sign me up!

This wasn't crypto though.  It was still fiat.  He hadn't made any purchase yet, he was just transferring money into his account there so he could make a purchase later.
