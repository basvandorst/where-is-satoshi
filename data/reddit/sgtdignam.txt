I agree, taking on student loans for a degree in basket weaving is not a good investment.  But in general (without pulling up statistics) college graduates make more money in their lifetime than non-graduates.  
On a sidenote: you should also look at how CDO's are being made of student debt.

Thank you.  This should be the top comment.  As bitcoin continues to grow, people will be coming to this page to UNDERSTAND bitcoin.  What they will be see?  They will us screaming about ATH's and people making mass amounts of money, they will see people taking out loans to invest.

A hard fork means that you will be getting an equal amount of a new form of BTC that is being called by most as B2X.  This will completely different from the other coin (referred to as BTC or bitcoin core).  It's like having a dollar and then getting a euro.   
What coinbase/GDAX meant by their announcement is that they will continue to call the current version of bitcoin "BTC" and the new coin "B2X".  Coinbase, though, will be evaluating over the next few weeks the "successfulness" of each coin (B2X and BTC), and basically if B2X becomes the more adopted coin or more successful coin, then coinbase will rename B2X as BTC and change BTC to something else.  
Basically whatever amount of bitcoin you have you will get the same amount of another coin similar to bitcoin but not the same.  
My advice (if you don't know what you're doing), is to hold both coins, let the dust settle over the next few weeks, and then sell the less "successful" coin.

Appreciate your response man.  I'm sure we've all been reading about the struggles in Venezuela, but hearing from it first hand really puts it into context for me.  It definitely makes more sense for you to do so.

What you want to do is called speculation.  But since you're posting about it that means you're already committed to the idea and will probably do it. 
I will not advise doing this, but if you do end up investing a significant amount of saving or taking out a loan, ensure you take profit or pay off your loan at the earliest opportunity to save yourself from a potential "crash". 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:44:33
In short no. 
Bitcoin is a currency/store of value.  People apply value to it, not any other entity.  So right now people are applying a value of ~$7000 USD/coin.  Right now people are valuing S2X at ~$1500 USD/coin.  
Just remember that something is only worth as much as someone else is willing to pay for it.

The huge change is that if you hold bitcoin before the fork occurs, you will receive the exact amount bitcoin you hold of a "new" coin currently called S2X (segwit2x).  They are not the same thing.  Most likely scenario that occurs: One of the coins continues to be valuable, the other coin, in all likelyhood, will decrease significantly in value.  This community believes that the current version of bitcoin will continue to be value and that the new coin S2X will not.

Here's the best advice I can give.  DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.  Its 2017, all of the possible information you need to know is out there on the internet.  I know I sound harsh, but asking for information on sites like reddit can lead to bad/one-sided information.  
My one piece of advice is buy bitcoin on GDAX (subsidiary of coinbase).  You won't waste money on fees.
From Warren Buffet (I know he doesn't like bitcoin but still applies) "Never invest in a business you cannot understand"

I wish I had known that coinbase charges you out the ass but buying on GDAX is basically free.
Coinbase charges a hefty beginner's tax.

Lol, that website though.  They're charging what's called a stupid tax/Evolution Tax.

Its very relevant, (proof of stake in my opinion is a much more efficient system).  I also look at bitcoin transaction times which are not fast (took me greater than 2 hours to transfer tonight). If the community wants bitcoin to be a currency, it needs to improve its ease of use and transaction times.  I also look at the fact that once all blocks are mined, 2140 or whatever, it is expected that mining will still be profitable from just transaction fees.  I highly doubt that the cost of energy it will take to hash will out weight the transaction fees that miners will be rewarded (far in the future probably should not be considered). 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:25:51
Your argument is inherently flawed.  Einstein was able to prove his theories as truth through observation and experimentation.  Can we empirically establish that bitcoin is better than the fiat/banking?  I think there are alot of theoretical arguments right now, that I agree with, but I don't believe there is sufficient empirical evidence yet.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:02:36
But with crypto, bots can manipulate that market by spam $.01 purchases to encourage people to think the price is going up.  This only costs them $.02/purchase.  In terms of the stock market, they would have to buy whole stocks instead of just spend $.02 like on crypto.  The margins by doing that is significantly less.  Plus the stock market at least has the SEC which is aware of this (bt Jordan Belfort and many others).  Who does crypto have?  
I'd love to hear more thoughts.  Honestly i'm freaking out right now feeling like i'm the only one who sees the end. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:49:58
No I think that I just justified my post fairly validly. I understand I wasn't the first to post that image, and probably deserved a "repost" comment.  If i'd been able to post an explaination with the link.. I would have.  I hope history we'll prove that we were all right and bitcoin will last.  But I don't want to be ignorant to the possibility that tomorrow it could all crash down. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:30:39
I read it already.  It had valid points.  The point of  my post was not to say we are bound to crash, but I just read rational posts about criticisms of bitcoin that are immediately dismissed without taking into consideration the opposing sides view. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:23:23
Its happening on ETH and LTC on GDAX.  This is why regulation will be a great thing for crypto.  Right now alot of people are going to sell and lose money, and those who have the bots are going to make a killing.... its sad
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:59:58
Under.  Look at the 1 day charts for BTC.  We're heavily overbought.  I see us heading south for the next few days, then prices will rises up until the S2X fork, probably up to right around that $7,250 valuation.  Then they will probably pull back to $5,500-6,000 range over a span of a week or 2.  I see us ending the year at slightly under that valuation.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:22:33
I'm invested also, but I really hate how every single opposing opinion to bitcoin is immediately dismissed.  Intelligent people listen to the opposing side in order to address their weaknesses.  I think we should embrace critiques.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:31:39
Let me edit for you.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:39:56
I definitely agree proof of work is more secure and prevents the 51% theory.  
Trust me I know about the lightning network.  I am not going to invest in something this heavily that I do not read all information available to me.  But the point i'm trying to make is that at this point in time, no matter the future of bitcoin, it is not better than the current system we have.  I think it will be that's why i'm invested.  But right now its not more efficient its not safer.  And when opposing opinions are immediately dismissed as "FUD" it points to delusion for me.  And when I see bitconnect on the top 8 by market cap, and ICO's with websites that could have been made by a 4th grader that accrue millions of dollars, it points to greed.  And when I hear that we will be getting rid of banks and fiat, it points to "new paradigm". 
In my opinion we should be focusing on education of the community.   Addressing the current flaws of crypto.  And be reasonable with our expectations (aka "BITCOIN to 10,000!!!!).

Unfortunately no one on here knows the future.  Bitcoin and cryptocurrency could very well go the way of tulip mania.  The reason educated investors in bitcoin and crypto (honestly most people have no clue why bitcoin has value they just see $$$$) see bitcoin and crypto as the future is because of the blockchain technology, proof of work concept (or proof of stake), and they have a distrust is traditional monetary systems.  It would take me a reddit book to explain all of this which is why...I recommend you read up more on bitcoin before you continue to invest.  That way you know what you are buying and you aren't just trying to snag a quick dollar.  
The book "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond" should explain what bitcoin is, why it has value, and why it is the future.  Or you can do some google/youtube research.  
I'm not trying to be an asshole, but it's actually better if you understand whether you believe in bitcoin or not.  That way if bitcoin/crypto were to fail, you don't feel like an "idiot" for throwing money at something because it was a quick buck.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:36:48
I'm mostly referring to the post about the UCLA professor who wrote an article about how bitcoins proof of work wastes alot of energy.  It has people calling this man an idiot and disregarding some valid points immediately.

@_date: 2017-10-21 03:59:10
I don't doubt the same thing happens, but on the stock market you have buy a whole stock (i.e. spend $X), instead of just buying $.01.  It's alot easier to do here.  
I'm not saying I'm 100% right but just look at LTC/ETH/BTC on GDAX right now (especially LTC/ETH).
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:01:43
Yeah I would stay away from Bitconnect.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:38:09
And I'm right.  Check prices now
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:49:24
Here's my theory - Team with massive amount of capital and a bot that spam a "Market Buy" of $.01 which will cost them only $.02 with fees.  This causes people to believe that the price is going up (many green numbers and rising candles), so people start buying actual amounts of BTC. Then once the Team/manipulator/bot reaches a designated sell point- it sells all of its BTC at that high price.  Then as everyone starts selling the price will go down.  The team/manipulator/bot will rebuy the exact same amount of BTC and also have the money from selling high.  I know one company/cryptocoin that advertises that they do this and also operates a ponzischeme.... Bitconnect.  
This why markets need regulation.  If a new user gets taken like this then they are unlikely to comeback to BTC and think its a fraud, when in reality its just someone manipulating the market.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:54:18
ICO's unfortunately do have something to do with Bitcoin.  Just refer to the .com bubble.  Google and amazon were affected (effected? terrible with that) by pets.com and others.  Again I'm not trying to say that correlation is causation, but history does have a way of repeating itself.  
My main problem is that very successful and very intelligent people have publicly come out against bitcoin.  And bitcoin does have flaws, it is not perfect.   But any opposing views are viewed as FUD by the community and people who might have doubts or questions, are ridiculed and told to GTFO.  We should be accepting criticism and trying to address concerns instead of ignoring.  
I'm honestly not 100% sure yet on the idea of no governing authority (central bank, SEC etc).  And my other concern is that Austrian Economists are even against bitcoin, when bitcoin, in theory, should embody austrian economics.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:29:52
I know the roller coaster.  I've been a gambler.  But what I'm talking about is actual market manipulation ( that I don't think most people are seeing.  If what I believe is going on happens in financial markets (Stocks, Bonds, etc), is punishable by jail time.  But there is no regulation for crypto so people are just watching it happen.  Bitconnect basically advertises that they do this on their website and is somehow a top ten cryptocurrency.  
I'm most likely going to HODL because I haven't invested enough where I will be in financial ruin if it goes bust, and there is upside potential by staying in.  But with the introduction of LedgerX and banks being able to basically gamble on it, I can definitely see where a massive amount of money could disappear and possibly affect more than just the BTC value.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:39:22
I need to post this so I can hear yall's thoughts..
I'm calling it right now.  There is going to be a major burst, maybe not tonight but sometime between now and segwit2x.  If you were on GDAX tonight you may have noticed how many bots were pumping the price of BTC up.  It made it all the way to like 6150ish.  Then they unloaded all of it.  While they were pumping up the price, they were pumping down the price of ETH and LTC so that people would sell so that they could buy back into BTC.  I am about ready to cash out and not lose all my money.  I think that crypto is the future but that this will be the example of why we need regulation why we need something like the SEC in on it.  This screams Jordan Belfortesque Pump and Dump.  If i had to point fingers I'd definitely point them at Bitconnect (if you want to know why I say that I can explain).  
But I really want to hear other opinions right now because I'm very close to "Calling bullshit on the whole thing" (Steve Carrell in The Big Short) and cashing out.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:26:55
Greed = Bitconnect, Crap ICO's.
Delusion = Dismissing all opposing opinions.
New Paradigm = Replacing banks and all fiat.
I believe that cryptocurrency is the future (actually invested).  But the toxicity and delusion in this community is incredible.
