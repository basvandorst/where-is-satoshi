Lol no it's not disingenuous if you let those material things consume you. Wal mart has good deals on champion activewear along with hit or miss on their fruit of the looms/hanes shirts. People rag on wal mart but they're a godsend (if you ignore their ethical side like how we all do to a certain degree).

Average down to sell is always a good investment strategy.

The public forgot about the black man incident and will forget about this chinese bs. It's how the public mind works and highly doubt DG will have sustained losses due to the racial comments.

You don't have any losses if you don't sell.

Someone posted links about subscribers and such, just be aware of the type of rhetoric Jordan Peterson uses whether good or bad.

Time Inc (if memory serves me right) is owned by the Koch Brothers. An easy google search will show how much their hand is dipped in the honey pot. Koch vowed they wouldn't interfere with Time, but Murdoch (definitely not hard to search for shit he's in) said the same of WSJ (and look how their credibility turned out post 2016). Follow the money
