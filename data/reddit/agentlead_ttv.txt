about 5 years ago i took a guy on a tandem skydive. its customary to tip your instructor after a job well done. as he is about to leave, he looks me dead in the eye, gives me a firm handshake. and says "heres your tip. buy bitcoin. now."
i didnt. i felt jipped out of a tip. if only i had sunk some money into it then.

so, yeah, we have hundreds of millions of dollars now, lets go live in a steel disk in the middle of the ocean off the coast of thailand.

cant these crypto sites get a decent proof reader or spell checker? i swear every time i load up one of these crypto blogs there is always some glaring mistake. makes the rest of the article hard to take seriously.
