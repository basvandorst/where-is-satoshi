If you held Bitcoin private keys on Aug. 1, 2017, you need to pay tax on Bcash income ($266 income per 1 BTC)
Edit: also, Bitcoin to any other digital currency is not a like-kind exchange. Every exchange is a trade where you realize captial gain or loss.

Oh please, this reply is a cheap and tactless way to score internet points. OP is telling us how BTC can help when a currency is being devalued. Yes, it sucks. It may even be the government's fault. You still don't need to grandstand.

People are downvoting you because they are relying on common sense. Unfortunately, common sense does not equate to law and as far as every tax attorney and CPA I've talked to has said, you are correct.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:04:41
Look, I don't disagree with you. What you're saying makes common sense. However, common sense is not law. Every tax attorney and CPA I've talked to has said that gaining access to a forked coin is an income event that must be reported and for which you must pay tax. If you've got a similarly-credentialed source that is willing to put their career on the line and take liability to say otherwise, let me know who they are so I can file taxes with them.

I thought about this for a long time back in 2011, and got stuck at the same place each of these services seem to start getting vague on the details:
How do you create any sort of guarantee that you get what you pay for?
For example, I want cloud storage. I upload my junk to "the cloud" and pay 0.005 BTC/month to whoever's storing it for me (like BackBlaze)
After a couple years, I need to recover something. Only, I discover that all my data is missing and they've just been taking my money and dumping my data in a hole.
How do you prevent this?
I've had ideas, but none are bulletproof because they all rely on altruism. Unscrupulous individuals will therefore be able to take advantage of people and ruin the system.

I agree it's unrealistic, but solving the attack by 1 is easier to reason about and it solves the attack by many. I can't quite get my head around how multiple selfish pools would treat each others' found blocks. If they're of comparable size, they may both maintain their separate forks until the remaining set of unselfish miners helps one of them maintain a lead.

Two pools is not the issue here. I see where you're going with this, though. Intuitively, if everyone does it, the advantage should be nullified.
However, I'd say that we should stick to analyzing the single-attacker first because it is more simple. If we can prove single-attacker doesn't work, then it would prevent the need for this more complex analysis.
You asked about the block headers earlier, and I went and looked up the protocol spec for timestamps:
Rules 5 and 13 apply here. Rule 5 says the block can't be more than 2 hours in the future and be accepted as valid. Rule 13 says the block can't have a timestamp "before the median time of the last 11 blocks".
If the attacker were generating blocks in advance, they may start to fall afoul of rule 13.
Just as I wrote this, though, I realized the attacker could simply guess at a time that made the blocks appear to be generated 10 minutes apart. So, timestamping doesn't really help.
As for complexity, adding transactions does not increase the complexity of a block. The only measure of complexity is the difficulty sum which, as long as you don't cross a difficulty adjustment, is equivalent to the length.
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:08:53


Exactly. Nobody knows at all; we are still in the early adopters phase. Expect any money you put into BTC to be 75% gone this time next year. If you're OK with that, invest.

The quote you posted was made by someone from and is NOT the official position of the Bitcoin Foundation. You cherrypicked a dissenting opinion made by a Redditor who happens to have a BF account and are using it as if it represents the Foundation's official stance.
I'd be interested if you could find quotes by the Foundation's leaders 'vehemently' disclaiming the idea instead.

You don't need to know the previous block in order to mine the next block. All that happens when you join a pool is you get a number and a range of nonces to check. You check those nonces to see if H(number + nonce) &lt; target. You never need to know the contents of the previous block.  All you need is that number.
Only the pool owner needs to know the whole block, and the pool owner by definition will not give up the secret.

I'm sorry, but that's not correct.
Only 2 people know the solution: the miner who finds the nonce and the pool owner. Neither has an incentive to reveal it. The other miners can't reveal anything because they don't know the nonce.
Upvote for thinking about it though. Most people are just dismissing this.

Therein lies the temptation. Your brain is wired for short-term gratification. Don't give in!!
I don't mean to lecture, just to pass on some advice that I got from my grandfather by way of my dad: resist the temptation of quick wins when investing.
Predicting the short-term market is very hard.  Remember that article yesterday about how this rally is just getting started? Yeah. Not 24 hours later the price was down 20%. It's coming back now, but nobody knows what exactly is going to happen.
In the long term, I agree that the price is likely to go up 5-100x from where it is now. There are just so many things that have yet to happen which will cause the price to rise, such as Google or Amazon accepting BTC payments, seeing an influx of Indian / African capital, the resolution of the SR case, the next time the US flirts with the debt ceiling or the Winklevoss ETF hitting the NYSE.
However, any value you lose trying to time the market is also amplified in the long term. You can very easily lose out on half your gain by being in the wrong position when the price moves.
A lot of people had investor's remorse when the price crashed from $30 for the first time.  But looking back now, if we had bought slowly all the way up and all the way down, we'd be sitting happily today with at least a 10x ROI--and without having stressed about the short-term dip to $2.  Same thing applies today.
This is a **very** high risk but **very** high return venture. Bitcoin will succeed or fail spectacularly.  There is no middle ground.  If you want middle ground, buy a utility ETF with a nice dividend.  But if you think Bitcoin will succeed, the only thing to do is buy--slowly and deliberately.

The complexity does determine which ~~block~~ chain (edit) is longer, but complexity is derived from sum of solved difficulty. They have equivalent difficulty as long as (1) they don't cross a difficulty adjustment threshold and (2) they have equal height.

Bitcoin has some issues, but nothing major. I am convinced that BTC is solid. I'd compare it to TCP-IP: there are some flaws, but by sheer volume &amp; network effects it's here to stay.
A quick summary of my main criticisms of Bitcoin:
 * Use of SHA-256 as a hash function
 * Proof of work based only on computational power
 * Front-loaded coin distribution curve
 * Winner-take-all block mining
 * Use of prime-number based public-key cryptography
 * Pseudonymous, not anonymous
I'll write about this in detail below since it's the first time I'm talking about this publicly.  I'll understand if you don't feel like reading it all! I'm putting this here to link from [my Twitter](
Using SHA-256 as a hash function was an unfortunate choice because it means that [ASICs]( (the ones that power the mining rings with 400 MH/s speeds) built specifically to mine BTC take over the network.  This pushes out smaller miners like you or me--we'd spend hundreds of times more on electricity to mine BTC than someone who owns an ASIC.
What's the problem? BTC's security proposition is based on having enough mining power *that does not collude to attack the block chain*.  ASICs require substantial up-front investment which this pushes out individual miners.  By pushing out smaller miners, you centralize control of the block chain into fewer peoples' hands. Fewer individuals mining (regardless of the computational power that drives the mining) means it's easier to attack the protocol.
Litecoin recognized this issue and uses a different hash function.  This function prevents ASICs from being so much better than regular computers that it makes individual mining meaningless.  Like LTC, my protocol opts to use [scrypt]( as its hash function.
**Proof of work based only on computational power**
Doing all this hashing just to maintain the block chain is painful from an environmental standpoint. BTC miners collectively consume the power of a small city--all day, every day. There is another way to do block mining called "proof-of-stake" used by [PPCoin]( It isn't without its criticisms, but it undeniably reduces the power required by a large amount.  The main criticism is even worse front-loaded coin distribution than BTC, which I hit next.
I'm also working on a way to make the proof itself do useful work, inspired by [Primecoin](
**Front-loaded coin distribution curve**
The early miners of BTC mined an absurdly large amount of coin basically for free.  Yes, they had to run their computers and make a small "investment" in power cost. However, people who play World of Warcraft consume a similar amount of power and nobody argues that they are "investing" in anything and should be justly rewarded.  The founders did it because they thought it was fun, or they believed in the ideals, or whatever else.  But given that the goal was to make a world-accessible digital currency/store of value...the early adopters got off way better than they should have and this makes a lot of people wary of BTC.  I am.  I mean, in the early days a pizza was bought for 11,000 BTC . That's 2.2 million USD today!
The solution here is to have the total coins follow an [S curve]( Start with a very small block reward so the founders don't ruin the economy by hoarding all the coins while mining is easy and the word spreads.  As the coin becomes popular, the block reward goes up slightly to compensate so this keeps the value in check and starts to grow proportionally with interest (instead of against it).  Psychologically, people don't feel like they "missed the boat" because for the first few years, rewards increase with time rather than decrease.
**Winner-take-all block mining**
Whoever mines a Bitcoin block gets all of the block rewards--all the transaction fees, and the 25 BTC created per block.  This pushes miners to pool their resources to get a better chance at receiving the reward.  Pools are another form of centralization, and this weakens the security proposition for the same reason that ASICs do.  Fewer independent groups participating in the network makes it easier to attack.
This method also disincentivizes cooperation between miners. For example, say all of BTC's mining power was split between mining pools A (45%), B (45%) and a handful of assorted other miners (10%).  B finds a solution and forwards it.  Because the reward is so large and both A and B have comparable mining power, A might reject B's solution for a few minutes--even though it's valid--so that it has a shot at getting the reward instead.  Both A and B can 'fight' over the block chain like this, rejecting each others' solutions, which causes all sorts of havoc.
The alternative I use is to distribute transaction fees among those who forward a transaction within the network.  If you want to transact coins, you sign a transaction to the addresses of all of your neighbors.  They each sign it to each of their neighbors and so on.  When someone mines a block, transaction fees for all of the transactions they include are distributed to each address along the signed forwarding path, so everyone gets awarded.  The person mining the block gets the majority of the fees (to incentivize finding the solution) but the reward is spread as part of the protocol to encourage that person and each of their peers to accept the block solution.
**Use of prime-number based public-key cryptography**
Bitcoin uses prime number based public-key cryptography to protect transactions. It hasn't been proven that factoring the product of large primes is fundamentally "hard".  In fact, Shor's Algorithm provides a polynomial-time solution if you have a quantum computer.  What this means is that nobody's BTC is safe from theft once a powerful enough quantum computer is built.  That'll probably happen in our lifetime, and practically certain to happen in next 250 years.  If BTC is to stick around as, say, the American Dollar has (much less gold) it needs to be based on a different cryptographic primitive.  Note that this isn't a cataclysmic scenario; everyone's coins won't be hacked overnight or anything.  The first people to develop a quantum computer of sufficient capacity and run Shor's algorithm on 2048-bit prime factors will be scientists with huge grants and will win a Nobel prize.  Everyone will know about it long in advance of a generally-available product.  That said, when it happens BTC will *have* to change protocols, and the alternatives aren't drop-in compatible with the current block chain.
To avoid this mess from the start, the coin system I devised instead uses [Lamport signatures]( and a [Merkle hash tree]( to sign transactions.  The downside to using Lamport signatures is that you need very large signatures--at first glance, about 16x larger.  I invented some tricks to shrink the signature by requiring increased computation time, but my best effort still leaves the signatures requiring 4x the space of BTC.
**Pseudonymous, not anonymous**
It's very easy to track people using BTC. However, it doesn't have to be.  The core of the [Zerocoin]( extension to BTC 
is a natural consequence of the algorithm I created.
Okay! That was way too long and not that related to BTC but hope you enjoyed reading. :)

Also, what was your thought process behind this implementation? The tokenizing design unusual and...not very good. It does prevent against most of the basic attacks, but it rejects perfectly benign, valid JSON and lets through some really bizarre constructs.

You don't get a copy of the block chain when you join a pool. There is no such thing as a mole miner, unfortunately.

Yes, they can tell that their source number has changed. From that they can infer that a block has been mined; however, this can be masked in a number of ways.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:47:10
There are definitely ways to fix the issue, but I'd rather it not be a viable attack at all because the fixes are not fun. The first fix I can think of would make pooled mining all but impossible.
Unfortunately, the energy and effort doesn't really make much of a difference if the issue is self-reinforcing. Any guaranteed advantage one miner can gain over another is, by definition, worth taking.

Think long term. I sold at $183 thinking that was a peak. It was...for a couple days, then we rocketed up and I had to buy back in after losing out due to coinbase turnaround time.
Now, I'm sitting on my coins and buying slowly. I agree with the all-or-nothing future of BTC. Optimistically, I think it's the "all" scenario. This means we are headed for $10k+ coins 10 years from now. In the meantime, enjoy the ride.

If I may throw in my 2 cents:

Today, BTC dropped 5% from 6 AM to 6PM. It is **extremely** volatile. Do yourself a favor and put in $100 at a time over 8 days--you may not get the best rate, but you won't get the worst either.

@_date: 2013-11-07 01:41:17
Yes, but you don't even need to know the reward address.
[Here is the block hashing algorithm](
Boiled down, this is the operation that is performed by a miner:
    for ($nonce = every number between $start_nonce to $end_nonce):
        $result = SHA256(SHA256({some stuff} + $nonce))
        if ($result &lt; $target) :
            tell the pool owner that $nonce mines the next block
The pool owner sends every member of the pool the same {some stuff} and a different range of nonces to check. So I'd check 0 to 1000, you'd check 1001 to 2000, Steve would check 2001 through 3000 and so on.
The {some stuff} only contains 68 bytes.
However: in looking over this again, you made me stumble across an interesting point. There is a timestamp in the block header. If clients start to reject blocks that have inconsistent timestamps, this attack does not work. Let's look into that!
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:11:42
2FA means 2-factor authentication.
What this means is that CoinBase will send you a text message with a code every time you try to log in.  You have to enter that code as a second step before gaining access to your account.  This adds the security that you both have possession of your phone and know your password.
If you're interested in further security, you should use a password generator to create a long, unique password that you only use for ConBase. I wrote my own, but I hear good things about KeyPass and 1Password.

A few things:
Take comfort, nobody knows what they're doing. We're all speculating in a sense. I thought seriously about buying 3000 BTC a little while ago but didn't because I didn't know what would happen.  Yes, I kicked myself for it but hindsight is 20/20.  Everyone who says they "know what they are doing" is BSing you. Nobody knows anything more than you do right now.
The only altcoin I'd invest in at the moment is LTC. Their security proposition is based on scrypt and I think it's solid. That said, they don't differentiate enough from BTC.  At best, I think BTC/LTC will stay constant in the long term. But remember, I don't know anything more than you do right now :)

That said, miners could leak the fact that the number they're being asked to search has changed.  That implies that the private chain got longer; however, even that information could be potentially hidden if the pool was properly designed.
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:04:45
You're welcome! Feel free to ask anything you'd like, I've studied the protocol quite a lot while I was coming up with my own alt-coin!
The "target integer" as I invented for the highly simplified explanation and what you've heard about hash results with leading zeroes are really the same thing.
Let's say you're mining a block chain that has a hash of 10 decimal digits.  The highest possible value is then 9999999999.  Finding a hash with 4 leading zeroes like "0000 and finding a number less than or equal to a target number of (0000)999999 means the same thing.
In Bitcoin, hash values are represented in binary as 256 0's and 1's.  So, finding a hash with 25 leading 0's is like finding a hash with integer value less than the number which is represented by 231 (256-25) ones in binary.  This number is so huge that it's more convenient to just talk about the bits, but it really is just a number and I find it's easier to explain things that way.
Hope that makes sense!  Let me know if another explanation would help.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:44:38
The algorithm for mining is pretty simple.  Here it is, glossing over a LOT of specifics:
    1. Pick a very large integer that everyone in the network agrees on.  Call this the seed.
    2. Pick another very large integer less than the seed.  Call this the target.
    3. Loop:
        a.  Pick any integer number.  Call this the nonce.
        b.  Listen for a solution from another computer on the network.  If solution arrived, set nonce = solution.
        c.   If HASH(seed+nonce) &lt; target, exit loop.  Otherwise, go to (3).
    4. A new block is created.  Set seed = HASH(seed+nonce+transactions)
    5. Adjust Difficulty:  If 2047 blocks have been mined since the last difficulty adjustment, then:
        a.  If time since last block &lt; 10 minutes, reduce the value of 'target' (to increase difficulty)
        b.  If time since last block &gt; 10 minutes, increase the value of 'target' (to reduce difficulty)
    6. Go to (3)
This glosses over a lot of the details.  The biggest invariants are:
- The very large integers must be the same number of bits as produced by the HASH function
- The HASH function is cryptographic; i.e. it approximates a random oracle so that the value seed+nonce is unpredictable in 3.c.  This turns the step into a random-chance machine with adjustable odds of "winning" and very easy proof that you have "won"
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:31:13
alanX is misinformed.
You don't need to know the previous block in order to mine the next block.* All that happens when you join a pool is you get a number and a range of nonces to check. You check those nonces to see if H(number + nonce) &lt; target. There is **absolutely no reason you ever need to know the contents of the previous block**. All you need is that number.
*You only need to know the previous block in order to verify that the block is intact and computed according to the protocol.
My point is that too many people are groupthinking this and just dismissing the claim without thinking about it themselves. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:43:42
