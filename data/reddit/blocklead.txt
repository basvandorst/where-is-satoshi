The real gangster is the one who starts a car company with his bitcoin, makes cars and only accepts bitcoin, and then buys out ferrari, thinking too small still...

You should definitely avoid learning javscript! All those sites are terrible.
It works fine for playing around. I've used it before if I had a repetitive task that I was doing, but I use the console a lot. Not sure why you're so angry lol
You would get the value of the div with the price at some interval.
$( "price" ).val();
If it meets your conditions in an if statement say &gt;10000 then you would input the amount you want to buy.
Then you would have it click the buy button.
The rest is filling in the gaps with javascript/jquery. You could probably learn most of that at w3school: 
don't use this...
for some better options you could use the npm package: 
or github has a couple nice options.

There's not enough information to prove the claims, it's merely an observation and there's plenty of non intended reasons that explain this. Stretching to get some juicy titles, I feel bad for those that either just eat this up, or are confused and don't know enough.

actually serious bro. consider it. :D
not all in financially, all in as a human being with your talents and see how Bitcoin magically starts appearing with your contributions.

sounds like a scam, make it your last.
get a trezor, for next time. hubub yea it's not perfect, don't give physical access etc. it keeps you in a nice little safe arena, and adds things fast.

you should go all in mentally, and figure everything out. If you're actually 16 you have a spry mind and can adapt quickly. This could be more than a speculative thing, imagine working for some Bitcoin, and growing over time. Then you could attend Bitcoin University where you graduate in profit not debt. Also, avoid credit cards, and loans just saving you some time on that.
wish you luck heh
