Piss off faggot.
It's my right to have said that, as was it his to do whatever the fuck he wants to with his life.

I'll be sure to look into it more.
I've been sold on bitcoin since last summer, I just never actually tried to sell it myself.
Thank you for your advice. =)

I don't know how you're putting this much faith in Bitcoin.
Promises are one thing but everywhere you look people are trying to make that buck. For example:
"Here's how to loose 90 pounds in 3 months by doing something your body evolved to do naturally. Buy my book that literally just Ctrl-C's and pay me your money because I got to you first."
Remember, we all saw Bitcoin drop hundreds of $ too; how can anyone actually know what the market will do next? I am student who's so far into debt the numbers don't even feel real anymore. I can't afford ANY risk to what little I make because the moment I am told that I can't promise the school more money I am forced to drop out and pay off those numbers *without* a degree.
I understand the math, I get the science behind "hiding" what I own, but I can't past the risk of loosing when the buy in is so large.
Is there something I'm missing?
Edit: Thanks guys. I fucking love Reddit.

Which is the shitty clone?

But how in the fuck am I supposed to rationalize putting my money into such an unstable system?  I could theoretically make millions by transferring my Canadian currency to a lower value coin that's about to rise but no one knows what the exchange rate's going to be days/weeks into the future right?
Practically speaking, isn't Bitcoin essentially the same gamble?
Money in at one value, out at another?

Thanks, and let's hope Putin doesn't sneeze *too* close to that big 'ol red button...
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:51:11
That makes sense, thanks.
I'll take a look at what I can spare to not immediately pay RBC for the luxury of paying $200 a month in interest on that Line of Credit that doesn't even touch the Gov loans. Ugh.
Have a great day guys =)

Too bad we already know the answer the supercomputer will spit out, 42.
