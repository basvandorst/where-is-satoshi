Thanks :)
We are doing our best to get as more info as it goes, so our users can find everything they need at one place.
We are using wordpress and pulling the info from a lot of sources.
In the future we plan to add more info and tools and are open to any sugestions.
Also, a lot of work and time has been spend since there are only 2 of us that are working on it.
Still, seeing people like and support cryptoindex gives us the power to do more! :)

I Agree that they are morons, they fud around other projects with no reson. For me it is just a sad groop of people where you should not look for any opinions.

Cryptoindex.co is cryptocurrency market statistics portal that tracks over 1300 different (active) cryptocurrencies and tokens.
Every cryptocurrency has it's separate subpage with all relevant information about the project and all information is updated every minute.
**For every crypto we are presenting the following information:**
-Price in USD and BTC, since both are valualbe to traders and investors
-Price change in last 1h, 24h and 7 days
-Price in 14 leading fiat (national) currencies (EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY...)
-Market cap in regard to price and supply
-Trading volume in last 24h
-Circulating supply and total supply
And other important info.
**CryptoIndex.co was made because:**
1.We wanted a clean, mobile responsive site where we can find, calculate... all the info we needed.
2.We are large crypto enthusiasts and wanted to contribute to this great movement.
3.We are also more then happy to be able to help the crypto community and new users get all the info they need on one place.
4.We think contribution is important for adoption. (If you help someone understand how cryptocurrencies work, you are helping yourself) ;)
**CryptoIndex.co** is free to use for everybody who likes it! :)
If the community has any suggestions on how to improve they'r user experience and make CryptoIndex.co better and more useful, please feel free to suggest. 
Thx :)

There is, you just have to go inside a product and prices are displayed in all currencies.

Adding reptile supplies is also one of our goals.

@_date: 2015-02-02 14:31:43
That are different subreddits but I don't think we have to explain it to you since you are a redditor for less than 24h or you are using a dummy account to spread fud.
Once again we are sorry for disturbing!We won't answer or comment to any of your posts any more!
