@_date: 2016-08-09 06:11:44
Their customer service is shit. I made like 4 different accounts before i got one to finally work, but the menus are very buggy and CAD bank deposits have been removed. Now its just cc with high fees. 
I recommend Quadrigacx

Well obviously it's a wallet that you had used at one point. My assumption would be that it's recoverable somewhere. Try and use your brain and think hard to where you might have had a wallet. (e.g. Paper, hardware, exchange, brainwallet, Mobile Wallet, Etc.)

We need something like this, but here's my idea (take it with a grain of salt)
Make them have an option:
Implement a brave browser-style approach. Allow the viewer to watch the ads prior to the video and get paid in satoshis
show donate btc button somewhere before/during when ads are not present.

It took forever for a few of my tx' to confirm. It's horse shit, it never used to be like this.
I am not familiar whatsoever about the whole tx fees and block size issue, still don't understand any of it.

Hi there,
Thanks for your message!
Due to abuse from some users, we have unfortunately had to disable the use of Bitcoin on our site for the time being. While we do not have an ETA as to when the payment option will return, we're hoping it will return soon!
In the meantime, I encourage you to utilize one of our other payment methods if possible, such as PayPal or Stripe, so you don't miss out on a great deal.
I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. Thanks again, and have a great day!

So you're saying, in the case that you sent too few btc to the seller of a product, what would happen? You would have to contact them to get em back, or send more. This won't happen unless you are including the fee into the amount sent. 
Steam sells a game for  0.001 btc and so you send  0.001 btc. It will most certainly go through, **unless**- your wallet provider allows for sending btc including the fee. You might send 0.001 btc, but that also includes the TX fee, which might be around 0.0001 btc. You will have to send that much more to fix the issue.
It would be pretty difficult to do this on purpose.

Don't forget it would be a lot less than 21 trillion to make 1 million dollars per coin. Between HODL'rs and unusable coins, as well as unmoved coins, it would only have to reach about  ~5 trillion market cap to achieve a $1 million dollar coin. But at the current rate of Bitcoin adoption it'll take a long time to reach that number, even with current federal inflation rates.

Oh. My. God. Another 'intrinsic value' scientist. Look, if you think that bitcoin doesn't have 'intrinsic value' because it's not fucking shiny then you're simply mistaken.
Bitcoin is rare too, and used as a payment method. Last time I checked I cant go into a convenience store with a bar of gold and buy fucking chocolate bars. Or send gold across the internet in seconds without anyone's approval. **THAT'S** bitcoins intrinsic value. 
And to prove you wrong on yet another point, the cost of the energy required to mine and process gold is far, far greater than that of bitcoin.

Honestly I think it's a good way for bitcoin to get exposure as a speculative investment to those who aren't as familiar with using private keys like you and I. In turn, our bitcoin will become more valuable.
Example 1: My SO has a TFSA with cash sitting in it, I would much prefer her use the fund method of investing in Bitcoin as opposed to having cash sitting in that account. I wouldn't expect her to learn the ways of a bitcoin security guru, so therefore this might be the best way to grow her capital tax-free, and with limited knowledge and risk.
However, I'm totally with you. I will always hold my own keys.

Hmm, there are a few things wrong with this statement.
Population growth, while seemingly growing in a predictable manner, is not certain. On that same note, population growth doesn't necessarily mean more people will use Bitcoin.
Secondly, deflation != compounding value. The only compounding value you can make on currency is with banks/third parties that use an interest rate, where the exact compounding return can be calculated.

Foreign currency transfers are usually percentage based, you can spend hundreds even thousands sending/converting very large sums.

Every cad purchase, since the card is USD. It's a Canadian firm and Americans cant get the card. Their  business model makes no sense.
But I guess if you're like me and you're on a phone service provider that does not have an nfc sim, then this will be the only app to allow for nfc payments. But are you seriously wanting to pay 4% fee every time you make a purchase just so you don't have to carry a credit card around? I know I sure as hell don't.
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:53:27

@_date: 2016-10-11 05:19:47
If everyone started selling off their Bitcoins, then Bitcoins would drop in value significantly since so many people would be selling. Therefore the market value equation does not work in this case.
You need roughly twice the current buying rate to increase the price per Bitcoin by 100% (e.g. 60btc/minute trades to 120btc/minute trades). The price would then slowly rise to compensate. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:47:52

Sure, but try to convince someone to put their Bitcoins in a "bank". One of the selling features of Bitcoin is that you don't have to have do that like you would in a typical Financial scenario.
Also, since it's much more difficult to trace Bitcoin, few "banks" are going to want to lend Bitcoin out to people - KYC verification would be insane.
IIRC current bitcoin lending services have a crazy high default rate on the loans they provide.

I could go to LBC and sell my Bitcoin for higher than market value and get straight up cash to buy whatever I want.

The real reason for this is the first-mover advantage that Bitcoin has. It would take a lot of effort to try and get all the retailers to switch over to Litecoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 23:47:40
I'm just saying come up with a percentage fee based on previous blocks, maybe 10, 100, or 1000 even,  then the wallet provider can apply that percentage to how ever many btc you are sending.

Litecoin is asic resistant. You won't see that happen. 
Edit: I guess I was more thinking SHA256 asic resistant so existing BTC-U and BTC-C mining operations couldn't impact it much

I'll be honest and say I hate it when people refuse to watch an awesome show you recommend. E.g. Always brag about *Black Sails* to my buddies but none of them ever bite. 
However - shows that don't appear on Netflix are a pain to watch, I guess.

I'm a marketer myself, and I was thinking... 
Using **paranoia** is the best way to boost bitcoins adoption on a mass scale. 
E.g., ads in places like times square, busses, tv/internet, and definitely youtube, with paranoia as the main driving feature is really whats going to push citizens to find use out of this currency. A message would go something like: 
"Do you trust are government fully? Why do you use currency that is losing value constantly? Introducing Bitcoin. The invisble, easy-to-use, and most secure way to hold and gain value, WITHOUT government restrictions. 
Check out bitcoin.org or the r/bitcoin reddit for more information!“
The real question here is, who is going to pay for R&amp;D? Who is going to execute it?

Ugh. Why don't we have some sort of beginner's guide, *oh ya we do* at bitcoin.org
Yes you should be worried. If your coins are on coinbase, they aren't yours. Move them off the exchange  whenever possible . Once you control the private keys to your coins, you will need to backup your wallet using the passphrase given to you by the app you are using. I recommend mycelium.  If you're just holding your coins like me, use a paper wallet or trezor with a backup.

There's quite a few distinct differences that make Bitcoin a more viable alternative to fiat currency for the consumer. The biggest one being that it costs the merchant less money in the end to receive/process them, therefore they can pass along the savings to you and give a discount in some cases. Discounts (or just lower costs on items) would become more prevalent as Bitcoin becomes more widely used. Check out purse.io as a good example.
My favourite consumer benefit of Bitcoin is its deflationary value. USD, CAD, and other fiats are no longer backed by silver/gold, therefore your money will  become worth less over time. This is not this case with BTC, although in its early stages the volatility might not make that clear. 
TLDR: Discounts and deflationary value are (my favourite) arguably the best consumer benefits of Bitcoin.

To be fair, a backdoor could ultimately be possible but it's certainly unlikely given the amount of time the open source code has been available.

Probably.

Best exchange in Canada. Sure KYC sucks but be my guest and pay the 5-10% premium over at LBC.
