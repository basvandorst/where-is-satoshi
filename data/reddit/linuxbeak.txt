Does non-mining node count really mean much? Can't someone just fire up 10,000 raspberry nodes for very little money? I would imagine what the exchanges list as being bitcoin, and where the miners go is much more important

In order to ban anonymous cryptocurrencies you would need a level of centralized control over people that would in itself be very dangerous. Terrorism is bad, but in my opinion giving government the power to ban anonymous transactions with cryptocurrencies is worse (and also in my opinion impossible to do, in the same way that they can't seem to do anything about file sharing on the internet) Government was the  murderer of people in the 20th century, and history has shown over and over again that it has to be kept in check or it becomes extremely dangerous to your life and liberty. Of course they will probably try to ban certain cryptocurrencies at some point, but that will not make it go away, and will likely just mutate it and drive it underground and make it even more dangerous and usable for terrorists. Look to the war on drugs or the war on terror for analogous examples.

Can you pay off chain through that wallet software? Because I don't see how anyone is going to want to wait 40 minutes and pay big fees just to pay for something.

It works by the way the money supply is manipulated. Many large expensive wars are only made possible through debt and inflation of the national currency. Take the trillions of dollars spent by the United States on war in the middle east for example. If they had tried to pay for that war in an honest way by charging every citizen an additional tax, nobody would have agreed to it. "What? I have to pay a $2000 extra tax to pay for this war? No way!" Instead the federal reserve just "prints" more money and uses the hidden tax of inflation to pay for these wars. This hurts many people particularly the poor, whose money is now worth less. Saving becomes harder and the country goes deeper into debt.
Funding massive wars with bitcoin is much harder because it isn't based on this model of a central authority inflating money to pay out to these special interests in the military industrial complex.

It might, but the network is congested right now and the fee is low enough (120 satoshis per byte) that it's going to be stuck in there likely for some time. It will either go through eventually or expire, and you can send it again. You need at least around 220 satoshis per byte to get the transaction confirmed relatively quickly.

It would be harder, but you could still trade with it with in-person cash transactions or though distributed online services that are very hard to regulate or shut down. So you are right that it would make it harder, though it would also make it more difficult to regulate, and would still be usable by determined individuals.

I've been wondering this as well. Do you have to lock your bitcoins into a lightning multisig address first and wait for it to confirm?

I tried sending one of your txs through  but it is full right now.
You can use the following site to help calculate fees:
Right now you need at least around 270 satoshis/byte to have a transaction confirmed quickly. Some wallets are bad at calculating the fee and will send transactions with too low of a fee.

I disagree about one terrorist attack being worse than bankers having centralized control over the currency. The amount of economic terror and war profiteering enabled by the central banking system quite exceeds what most terrorists can dream of accomplishing in terms of suffering.
