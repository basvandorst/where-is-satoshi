Am I missing something that happened but BTC seems to be dumping bad in the last hour.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:35:31
Why would they do that? There has to be a reason.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:47:02
Weak hand , I think not. I have been in Crypto since 2011.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:46:41
Its over man, BTC is going back to 1K and the other cryptos will be worth pennies. And I am a bull.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:50:44
Hey Pomp, you feelin lonley, like no one pays attention to you, BTC is not going to zero, but its a good attention grabber.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:33:52
The T/A charts are so negative its really frightening, where are all these people that predicted 20K by the end of 2018, at this moment we will be lucky to see 1K by the end of 2018.

BTC is Bitcoin bcash is an altcoin

I would love to be as positive as you guys but every time it reaches 1100 and change it sells off. I dont want to be left behind, but I dont want to leave my profits on the table either.

The Bitcoin rally is real folks. and  the man name is Jamie Dimon
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:00:25
It almost hit 800, I only have about 25.5 BTC but I wont be spending them as I got them years ago at a price I can say, was very fair. If any of this is true my son wont have to work. LOL.

Drops like this are depressing because you never can tell if they are manipulated by the banks who want BTC to fail.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:02:11
From your words to the Lords ears. I pray it will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:45:11
Is that what your crystal ball said or are you just wishing
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:34:49
BTC is just going though a bear stage. It will come back to 10K in less than 3 weeks.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:40:03
Nobody, we wont see 7K ever again. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:33:44
I use Bitpay and find them extremely easy and I am happy to deal with them.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:19:29
I think BTC is coming to an end here folks, if it cant operate without exchange hacks, its over. Cant you imagine if someone hacked the Nasdaq
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:38:56
I think there is news, it just has not been reported yet. Lets see how far it goes down , or if it rebounds.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:38:24
This is making me sick, Crypto is a falling rock that wont go up    it was a faze, now its over. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:07:47
Please explain to me what the qualifications are to be an " Average User" ?
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:35:10
That might be correct if you have a few years, I am 75 and have poor health. I missed my chance in Dec to sell. Been hodling since 2011
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:21:24
Baloney, I just made a transfer from Coinbase to BOA on Feb 1st and another today, both went through fine. It only effects Credit Cards buying Crypto where you do not have that amount in your account
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:16:54
Useless thread, title is misleading
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:52:20
If the miners cant make money BTC is dead, just a matter of when, the hodlers are selling and the whales are worried.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:35:30
I have no idea why it would be a sad day to see BTC go up past 9K
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:03:04
This would be huge if it happens
@_date: 2016-07-30 17:00:22
Circle.com sucks plain and simple.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:32:49
LOL, did you change your mind.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:29:25
At this rate it will be less 500 before I go to bed
