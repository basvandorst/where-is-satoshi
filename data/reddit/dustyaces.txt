Notorious BIG

I made that clear in the first post. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:03:20
Where do you live again?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:45:19
This is awesome, thank you so much! I’ll be sure to rep it somewhere clever. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:12:41
......they did. Like I said in the original post, they didn’t do anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:13:39
Yep. You’re correct on the reasoning. I just thought it was bologna that they’d let me use CB and not GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:48:20
GDAX is just as bad. It won’t let me create an account even though they already have my information from my Coinbase Account. After emailing them, the best answer they could come up with was, “Sorry, younger adults may have trouble creating an account.” What a garbage excuse.

This is what happened. Everyone else calling me illiterate can fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:06:15
Again, that’s exactly what I tried to do. It didn’t work. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:33:46
Not sure I like a touchscreen. Just another thing to break. Also it seems like if it’s stolen they might see the fingerprints and guess the pin. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:46:02
Seems legit. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:55:43
Because Friday is payday.

You said Bitcoin was getting publicity. I agreed and stated it’s been publicized throughout the year. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:23:36
You could probably sell them for btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:35:15
Looks like it was reported $5200 on bittrex. It showed 5180.99 on Coinbase for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:13:54
Why not just keep the btc on the Coinbase app? Keeps it simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:10:21
Irrelevant if you hodl long enough
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:18:03
In 
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:28:01
How so? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:26:16
No this is Patrick. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:33:30
I guess. It already has been wildly publicized this entire year. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:09:49
Everything about that website looks like a scam. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:15:31
I suggest reading the original Bitcoin website. Tons of up to date information on how to get started. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:56:38
I never said that at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:29:47
Can someone explain why op is mad at the card
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:28:07
I think it’s just Vice getting bills paid. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:21:03
Only anonymous way to buy btc is offline through an atm. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:46
Almost already at $6k!
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:26:29
Very helpful. Thank you! Gonna check out his other videos as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:45:28
So who ended up winnin?
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:22:10
You’re an OG. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:03:29
Lol I took a ton of screenshots as well. Got me pretty excited.
