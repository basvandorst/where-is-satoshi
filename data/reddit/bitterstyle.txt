But cubic zirconia are distinguishable from real diamonds.

I've heard this before, but I don't understand how bitcoin would be a ponzi scheme if gold isn't. Gold doesn't even have a limited quantity.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:56:34
I understand that. I brought it up because it's another software marketplace.

It's also ductile and shiny, but its price depends mostly on psychology. Especially when they start mining asteroids.

So is this a good time to get into small-scale mining?
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:48:53
They obviously have a motive to do so, but that doesn't seem like an accurate analogy since bitcoin would have to actually die completely before you "lose" and I don't really see that happening.

I don't disagree that they're relatively trustworthy, but bitcoin is appealing to me because it doesn't require trust. I prefer that no individual or small group has control over something important like money.

I'm optimistic, and Bill Gates is introducing people to the concept of digital currencies, but I'm certain he recognizes an opportunity in piggybacking off of the concept as it enters the public consciousness. Also, I doubt Mr. Gates has "decentralized" in mind.

Interesting, I didn't know this. Why doesn't Steam?

There's worry about deflation in the US, leading up to a drop. Meanwhile the ECB is going to start their own QE bond buying program - printing Euros. The agreement seems to share risk across the EU despite the compromise, this puts added pressure on the Euro as a whole especially with Greek elections and a growing opposition to austerity measures.

For those who want their homepage: 
Edit: Also, you totally just blew my mind. This is big for a few reasons. Great to see infrastructure that circumvents the oligarchy.

Would higher volume (as in more widespread usage) decrease volatility? Also, I just got into this via the Circle app which has weekly buy and sell limits. I imagine lazy people like me with relatively small holdings would also contribute to stability.
Also: what are some leading alternatives right now? I can't necessarily see people flocking from bitcoin without a good reason.

I've argued this with an accountant before and he thought it was a good point. Anyone have more input?
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:16:53
I thought that's what 'peg' meant.

I feel somewhat out of my league here, but I got into Bitcoin because of Circle and I could see others doing the same. I bought some local beer with bitcoin last week and it felt really good to bypass the corporate titans completely.

That's the reason I'm here. I'm also reading up on proper cold storage now that I've been introduced.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:02:34
I'm pretty new - I got some open source "Paper Wallet" app from FDroid that's supposed to help generate public and private keys for storage. Even if I disconnect from the network, isn't there a possibility that these keys are all predetermined and known by someone with malicious intent? 
Also, can you point me in the direction of a good starting guide for using multisig? I'm relying on Circle right now and I know that's not ideal.

I'm new and sense a meme...

Newbie question: Is MD5 still valuable for verifying a Linux download for instance? It's maybe just not secure? I've seen your sentiment before and I'm looking for further reading.

Haha, thanks for summing that up. No, gold is valuable for its practical applications and everything else is psychological. The spot price is completely psychological, and that will become more clear as the supply increases.
