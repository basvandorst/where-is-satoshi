Sadly I I don't even have .1 BTC and my day job is ~50k per year, and my fiance got fired from her job before we made our first mortgage payment on our house this year. I don't have a ton extra to invest, but I do what I can with what I have. Thanks for the info though.

If a 20% market decrease isn't a dump.... that's frightening then.

At that price he prolly could fin a private party buyer.

Op is not talking about different amounts of money though, he's saying (hypotgetically): 
He put 500 in x years ago. It is now worth 100500, and he wants to take 500 out. Does he pay capital gains since he has not gained any fiat.

Do you know if I can still use GDAX for the free transfer of BTC out of coinbase by any chance? Or do I just need to deal and pay the higher coinbase fee?

Op's post 2 days ago:
I just made my first $3 on GDAX

This type of financial independence is my ultimate goal. More than anything else in life, I want to be beholden to no person or institutions.

Simply find a willing buy and exchange BTC for money, either face to face or via some online method.
