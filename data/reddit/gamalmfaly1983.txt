You could probably avoid the "I told you so" bullshit in the office by keeping your financial decisions to yourself. Also, I doubt people in an office are rushing to put down crypto unless you've specifically mentioned it being a sound investment or how it works and parlaying that into how you've bought xyz coin and have done well, etc. Seriously, why do people find it necessary to evangelize their coin choices to everyone that has a pair of ears?  
It's a bad idea to share that kind of information with others, especially the nosey big mouth office types.
If you did well, it's admirable not to be a braggart and keep those gains for your eyes only.

I was about to say, pretty much a different name on the same bullshit tender we have today.

You've just explained the partial reason behind the global mortgage meltdown.

No shit, that's a major benefit. The FED or reserve banks can't force pressure on crypto so they continue to say there's no benefit in it, it's not backed by reserves (the US dollar isn't either btw, it's all funny money).

Something about this movie is annoying

I didn't say you forced others to make donations to you. I said you were being willfully difficult in forcing people to pm you to get code you could easily throw up on GitHub. Likely, people would be happy at how you made some code easily available and probably donate to you.

Never heard of GitHub I guess?

Yup, it's still tied to a government and you can bet your ass that of the government releases it, it'll be traceable which defeats the benefit of crypto.

Could you just not say that at first?

So far I've seen tons of companies popping up with their fake ICOs and claims to change the universe with their crypto technologies. Best case example is obviously bitcoin but we'll get to a point where people don't want to sell anymore because they'll feel it'll continually get higher and higher without a limit.

No one's donated anything to you because for whatever odd reason you're annoyingly forcing others to pm you to ask for code when instead you could throw it up on GitHub but God forbid...
