Well then new adopters ,like me, would be driven away very quickly because of what the miners are doing

If its my first time using bitcoin and I have to wait 24 hours and I have never seen waiting for 24 hours in most online payment methods, its crazy!,and because I am unsatisfied and think this is a bad currency(in its current state, even tho it shouldn't even reach such a bad state as a good currency). It makes me a moron? Nice thinking there.
