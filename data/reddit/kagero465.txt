When you can pay for a house in Malta with Bitcoin, that's when I leave Scotland.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:30:43
Got to admit I had a shitter on!
But I did the crypto equivalent of the tuck and roll, or duck and cover. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:40:11
HODL your ASSL!!

I was once having Sunday afternoon sex watching formula 1.
Anyway, Micheal Schumacher crashed on the final lap of the penultimate Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso took the lead and I.... ahem, finished.

Hey I'm from Scotland.
In bitcoin for the long term.
Currently have bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin in blockchain and loaf wallets.
I want to buy a trezor.
Is there a link or thread anyone can point my to that will walk me through the process?

If bought crypto every time I read good news and sold every time I read articles like this, the exchanges would make a fortune out of me.
HODL.

I would just sit in there for hours on end, hiding.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:46:22
It's heeeeeere!
The worlds away to start getting interesting.
Sorry, but the thing I don't understand is, do Chinese government not subsidise a lot of bitcoin mining?
I'd of thought banning it would be the opposite to what they do?
And other countries that'll follow suit. ��

It's an addiction!
I'm 3 months in and still can't stop.
Minute it creeps under £3k I'm in again.

Well said man.
Noticed you've not had many comments..... denial.
The smartest, most honest thing I've heard anyone, anyone say since getting into crypto was 'you only need one Bitcoin'.
We will be our own undoing of Bitcoin.
It's like (the concept) of The Garden of Eden.
Greed and gluttony could destroy this beautiful idea. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:50:52
Zoom out.
Take a deep breath.
Go for a walk.
Look at some trees ☺️
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:10:54
So what happens in 2040 when all the bitcoin is expected to be mined?
Who verifies transactions then?
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:19:48
I've spent my whole life around people with money.
I was hoping people with Bitcoin would be different. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:08:24
Bless him, money's being transferred to my account so I can do it through coinbase.
He's ordered a Trezor and is going to 'HODL' ��
It's not for him, it's for his grandchildren.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:52:14
Then what?
You can't post this and stop at C...
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:24:02
Takes a few days for coinbase to fully, I don't know authentic you.
Try phoning your bank too, I did this just to let them know.
30 minutes later my first transaction went through. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:10:51
Stop it, you're scaring the children!

That's the HODL of all motherf**king HODLS.
Not only just huge balls, but they must be titanium by now.

In Britain we call your "period" a full stop.
And over here a period is that time of the month when women go mental and loose blood. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:36:11
Bitcoin found me.
Been best friends ever since. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:22:02
Ok then......
Besides being a very positive and motivated kinda guy, I just think, it's too good to be true.
Don't get me wrong, I'm in, I love it. I loved the concept before I bought and even more since I did. 
But, all my life, when something's to good to be true or work out or maybe it's just my luck.
It doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:35:31
Get your money into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:58:34
After doing all this research on the technology and ideology of Bitcoin, their must be a side of you that respects it at least a little bit?
You must be able to understand why people believe in Bitcoin to certain degree?
Given that, do you own any Bitcoin or even play around with the notion of owning Bitcoin?
I mean, there must be a fraction of you that thinks 'what if?'
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:51:30
Painful watch.
Think he's stoned.
