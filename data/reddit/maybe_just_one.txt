If you are in the US transfer it to your bank account then use coinbase or circle to buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 17:45:15


Says someone who has no idea how modern encryption works. That statement doesn't even really make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:44:12
I agree. I can't even really recommend newcomers try bitcoin right now because they wouldn't even have the option to sell unless they kept all their bitcoin on an exchange wallet. 
Have we really gotten to the point where it's better to risk an exchange hack than risk losing your bitcoin to transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:48:36
Fees not high enough, I have a 400 sat/byte transaction that is still unconfirmed after 48 hours
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:29
Can't transfer to an exchange without $30 fee anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:49:18
Yeah I would definitely do some research. ViaBTC is a real pool though, so that's a good start.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:33:38
Can't help you there, I've never actually had to do it. Hopefully someone else knows. I do know they are called "Transaction accelerators" most of the time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:15
Good TVs do go on sale on black friday, they just aren't the $200 doorbuster on the front of flyers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:04:44
And regular miners benefit from this (at the expense of the spammers). We need more accessible, competitive asics more than ever. Then we can fix the network and gobble up all that sweet transaction fee spam.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:00:52
If we don't get the fee situation under control we risk losing bitcoin to the shitty bcash devs.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:21:34
You can pay pools directly and they will add it in their next block.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:25:54
Yes, you just need the transaction id
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:16:17
How do they charge the card then? Does Apple act as the middleman?
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:09:58
Edit: nvm
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:23:44
Ah, I didn't know they were doing that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:30:39
Especially CPU miners.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:45:56
How is this any different than the other wallet apps available. Doesn't it just store credit cards?
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:03:24
Well that hasn't stopped them before....
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:15:37
They have for a few months now. I bought several things with bitcoin already.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:30:14
10 times as long, difficulty readjust every 2016 blocks.
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:23:06
This site went down for months last year, I actually hadn't realized they had opened back up. Same deal, withdraw your BTC or you aren't getting them back.
The creator was considered a scammer by many on bitcointalk last year, probably still is, although I don't go on there anymore.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:36:15
Well if you still don't have an answer, here is one.If you don't mind divulging personal info coinbase is your best bet in the US and I think Bitstamp is for Europeans. If you would like to stay anonymous you will have to meet someone in person on localbitcoins.Any paypal/credit card exchange will either charge huge fees or just steal your money. I would avoid if you can.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:28:36
And I say that the history is too short to make that assumption, bitcoin is much bigger than it was in 2011. Banks, governments, and businesses are now taking notice. Don't get me wrong, I'm holding, but people who are getting at have valid reasons too. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:23:37
What's stopping someone from setting up bitpay to convert instantly?
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:04:24
No one knows what is going to happen. Period.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:10:18
Just spent about $100. FUTURE!!
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:07:34
Cryptsy is the best alt-coin exchange that handles pretty much every coin. Most legit exchanges will only handle 5-10 altcoins. 
Cryptsy isn't perfect, sometimes withdrawals/deposits take a while, but they always go through eventually. They have never been hacked/scammed people; at least to my knowledge. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:18:36
No, they are GPUs with high bandwith memory. They can do other things besides hashing.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:30:52
I wouldn't be surprised if someone is keeping a new ASIC all to themselves, I mean if it really is profitable why sell it?
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:37:42
Their USD market is on hold until early April because of some regulatory restrictions.
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:11:43
Agreed, don't know why people expected to not have to pay taxes. As long as they just apply existing tax laws to bitcoins and not some special tax I'm fine with it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:01:33
What will the tax rate be? And will it apply to purchasing goods or all transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:01:23
Do they ever have discounts/sales?
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:24:11
Didn't he take mcxnow down for months early this year/last year? Why would someone use his site?
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:44:30
I believe bitgo does this.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:26:43
I didn't say you said it was a fact.... just that even people who's job it is to forecast financial markets end up not doing any better than just straight up guessing. Forecasting is shit.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:38:29
I would agree with that, but I also think that it makes 2011 comparisons difficult.
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:43:06
VoS plz come to my state.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:40:14
There are so many profit-switching pools now I don't think it would matter.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:18:22
No, you aren't any different than the people saying that it's going to zero.  Bitcoin has only been around a short time, history doesn't mean much.
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:06:33
Well that wasn't the case until a few years into the war, most people supported the war until 2004-2005.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:40:59
I thought you went bankrupt????
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:40:50
That is why I'm in also, because I think the technology is groundbreaking and because I think it would be good for everyone. But I'm also prepared to lose it all.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:19:10
You can attempt to forecast anything. There are no facts, even peoples who's job it is to forecast this stuff suck at it.

GPU mining botnets?
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:18:41

Hey paypal, the US government scammed me, can you reverse the transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:34:33
I agree about luck, it is the main factor I think. And I'm not disregarding history, but I just think bitcoins history is too short to make assumptions. I think the history of the internet is a better indicator.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:36:19
Resource monitor should do it.
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:29:19
More likely it's a scam.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:18:22
No, they are GPUs with high bandwith memory. They can do other things besides hashing.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:50:20
Neither of those exchanges actually use ACH. CampBX used to but it's been gone for all while, apparently their bank bailed on it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:24:34
And people who are saying get out are not making a calculated risk?
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:19:59
Not nearly as many coins and still pretty new.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:54:47
I wouldn't say bad, but it's not good either.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:32:36
It's not always easy to trade back to USD, you have to wait a few days minimum. Gyft is nearly instant.

Just an estimate of how many hours a week I run processor intensive tasks, and may need to shut off my node to get the best performance.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:43:04
The keyword is average. In the US there are 1.3 trillion dollars in circulation, that's already enough to cover $100 for all 7 billion people.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:55:41
Wow, this is perfect. My bank has frozen my checking account temporarily because someone who I sold bitcoins to said the payment was unauthorized. It was partly my fault because I wasn't careful enough but I don't see why they had to freeze all my funds.  
  
The semester just started and I need to buy textbooks. I was looking at having to wait awhile but no more. Screw banks telling me when I can and can't spend my money.
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:14:48
Is there anyway to create a 2of3 wallet where Copay holds one key, and you hold the other 2? I really like this setup and have a hard time going to anything else.
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:12:30
It sounded like they just wanted to apply capital gains taxes to it, which makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:31:00
Thanks, any idea how to get the last key (my second key)?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:31:34
1 block used to be 50 BTC.
I didn't know about bitcoin then, but early on I believe it was common for a person with normal consumer hardware to mine 1 or more blocks a day.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:40:57
Wasn't circle getting out of crypto at one point? What happened?

@_date: 2018-07-19 03:18:02
We are in the great alt-coin bubble. I just hope the crash doesn't hit bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:26:17
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:01:28
Ok, but if you knew the protocol you could probably decode it the same way as that LN invoice. 
You have to know the first two characters are the prefix, the next two are the currency, and you have to know what format they are storing the numbers in.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:47:37
They use network protocols like TCP, and UDP. Headers on those are somewhat human readable. You just have to know which bits are for which fields, same as the LN invoice.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:14:29
Obviously encrypted protocols are exceptions.
@_date: 2015-11-01 00:43:37
Poloniex was hacked last year though, Cryptsy has never been hacked.

G2A is a gray market site, I wouldn't use them.
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:01:24
I don't mean the keys won't work, just that they may be stolen, or from poorer countries where the prices are lower. It's unlikely they will be deactivated (although it has happened), but the developer isn't getting any of that money.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:42:27
Well neither of those are network protocols, things like that are usually implemented as libraries.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:43:18
If this qualifies as human readable then like all network protocols are human readable. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:54:32
I thought that the 2.9% + 0.30 was the normal fee? Is it different for foreign countries or something?
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:36:23
But these are ASICs, you would have to fab completely new units, you can't upgrade your existing rigs.
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:25:06
Well their TOS does say US only.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:31:53
Don't US regs require them to do that?
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:03:17
They said they were looking for a new processor, I guess they found one.

Gemini is awesome, highly recommend Washington bitcoiners give it a try. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:04:52
It isnt a PO box, po boxes say PO box in the address.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:31:51
No, you would be better off mining some CPU only altcoins like primecoin or protoshares then just converting to BTC later. Even then you wouldn't be making much, I don't think mac minis have good cpus.

I just used dwolla like two weeks ago. What happened?
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:09:25
No one near me on localbitcoins, if I can't find anything else by the morning I'll probably do bitquick, I'd prefer to get the coins tonight though.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:44:43
That's what I figured. I always use the same fee and it was always confirmed in under an hour. I didn't realize the transaction size was so large.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:17:51
Yeah Coinbase isn't really an exchange, just a place you can buy coins relatively cheaply. I prefer CampBX, I usually just send a check because I live close to Atlanta and it's free.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:40:05
Did you try contacting them?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:57:05
Yeah seems pretty busy now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:26:21
People on localbitcoins already do this, but the more the merrier.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:38:21
Hmm I dont see a minimum on the withdrawal page or the FAQ, but I've never tried withdrawing less than .1 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:44:33
CampBX market prices are usually $10-50 lower than bitstamp prices, much better for buying cheap BTC.
Also you can send a check if you are verified.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:12:17
Btcquick or localbitcoins are pretty much your only options. Be prepared for high fees.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:48:52
I love the site, but only way to get USD in is wire transfers at the moment. They said they would have ACH transfers but that never happened.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:47:19
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:58:55
Not fast enough unfortunately, I don't have a verified account yet.

I used to work at subway, the bread isn't all the same size. Depending on how you stretch the dough it could be about 1 inch larger or smaller. However you get the same amount of meat no matter what.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:36:09
My transaction from 5 hours ago still hasn't even gotten 1 confirmation. :(
Edit: 1 Confirmation hell yeah!
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:49:26
It didn't need to be immediate, just not 5 hours. I've done transactions with no fee that didn't take this long.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:37:46
Um, that is 2 factor authentication.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:20:15
Bitstamp has SEPA, he wouldn't be using a wire transfer if he was in the EU.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:53:17
Great. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:43:55
Awesome, downloading now.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:14:10
Yeah I found one that accepts transfers from a USAA account. Cheaper than btcquick too! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:38:17
There is none, it's an actual exchange.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:46:10
I would rather use an exchange. But does Coinbase charge a fee for withdrawing to a bank account?
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:48:16
Yeah I don't really care how long it takes as long as it isn't ridiculous. But that seems like a great option. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:48:43

Win8 tablet with LTE?
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:39:14
Just used it as of two weeks ago. It was a long wait but worth it for the low transfer fee.
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:08:30
Same thing happened to me. They will get it sorted out eventually if you fill out a support ticket. Just be as descriptive as possible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:26:26
They were getting DDOSed.
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:44:56
Will CampBx continue to use Dwolla?
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:47:55
Private Internet Access accepts bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:42:24
Set up only takes a few minutes, but right now it takes a few days to get coins in. Money orders and personal check are the only ways to currently deposit money, but ACH transfers are coming on the 20th.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:04:32
Doubt it, those can be reversed too easily. They don't actually get the money for 3-4 days.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:08:45
You can't be serious.... they are probably the biggest US based exchange. They accepted Dwolla up until a few months ago but obviously they had to figure out something else.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:23:29
19% now, at least the page didn't crash....
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:10:42
No, they never sent me a letter, they just send a text to my phone.
