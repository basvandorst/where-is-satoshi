I bought some bitcoin to buy a domain name anonymously back in like 2015 or 2016.  I still had like $50 left over and forgot about it till the surge in 2017.  It has turned into $500.  Bought some more and am hodl.  I consider myself lucky because at no point would I have ever bothered to get into it earlier, it just wasn’t on my radar

I just transferred a test amount from GDAX to Gemini.  How long do btc transfers usually take?

I have a very smart friend on FB who keeps posting about how it’s a tulip craze and being all smug.  I suspect it’s because he doesn’t own any Bitcoin and he’s jealous

There are still upstanding breeders out there.  Just don't support puppy mills or backyard breeders on Craigslist.  
I had a hell of a time trying to adopt here in So Cal (I wanted a certain breed mix, not a pit or a chihuahua) so I ended up researching a decent breeder.  I stand by my decision 100%.

I know....I’m kinda glad I am busy with other life stuff so I’m not obsessing over this drama and tinkering with selling and stuff

This, and thanks for not shaming someone for wanting a certain type of dog raised by caring people who raise dogs with love.

That's like my story where I bought a small amount of bitcoin a year ago to purchase a domain name and then never bought the domain.  Forgot about the coins till this week.  Lucky me.
