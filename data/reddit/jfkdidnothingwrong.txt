I would declare bankruptcy if I became in debt more than I could ever afford.

I didn't say I am against taxation, the nation must continue. Roads, police, etc, are to the benefit and continuation of the nation. We take their money not because we are entitled to it, but because it is pragmatic to do so. 
Lack of safety or roads is bad for business. It is bad for the nation state. Whether the money is rightfully ours or not, we take it, for it is what ought to be done.

That isn't normally how to goes down. You don't normally get a loan. You get the treatment and don't pay, so you go in massive debt.

Sorry I should stipulate with actually good care. The USA has the best in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:20:30
No free lunch. You go into massive debt though, you don't die.

Get a job with insurance. If you have that it is a superior system.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:36:55
That's why you get a job with insurance. You don't work a shit job, you go to school or learn a trade and not work some shit job.
Also shit quality of life? The poor in America are in the what 1%, 2% of the world? Nevermind you get that without working at all. Quit the damn hyperboles.
You shouldn't be content living on welfare, you should want to work and get a better quality of life.

That other guys comment pretty much dispels this entire argument.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:40:53
And what about people on welfare for generations?
Also again how then can you say the rich are exploiting the poor, if they are being exploited to provide for the poor who do not work?
I mean your emotional arguments are all fine and dandy while you forget that it isn't anyone else's fault.
If the poor were only on welfare temporary or if there was a limit for how long you could get it, these emotional arguments are void. What about those who simply do not want to work, who are too lazy?
Also to put it frankly one can argue that exploitation in some cases is good. For one can argue sometimes one must suffer for the collective. This would be a logical argument.

Or have insurance which is the vast majority of people.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:48:22
Having a good job doesn't make you rich. That makes you middle class. 
Also the poor are living off welfare from the taxes of the more wealthy. Tell me how the poor are being exploited? Seems like the reverse to me.

No. Not for those with good insurance.
There is no country with a shorter waiting time than the USA for those with enough money.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:24:13
I wouldn't want to get shit care in a country like China. America has the best doctors in the world, mostly because of their system. 
Doctors in say Canada leave for the USA so much there is a doctor shortage there.

Even the UK has lower quality care than the USA. If you have a job with good insurance there is no better country for Healthcare than the USA.
The quality is the best in the world bar none.
In the USA if you have money to go on healthcare tourism you probably have a good enough job that you have insurance.

Okay, without getting into the obvious anti-collectivization arguments and the damaged economic growth of higher taxes, some problems include lower quality care. Less research, ergo slower development of new medicines etc. 
This would result from the massive loss of profitability of private research, which is where majority of American research is done. 
It would also result in longer wait times, and less doctors. It would destroy the current massive brain drain the USA benefits from with other nations. Large amounts of doctors from say Canada move to the USA as they can make far more money, the best doctors go to America. Switch systems and this will end. 
For those with a job, that has insurance(ergo most proper jobs) the American system is vastly superior. Only for the poor and unemployed it can be argued to be a worse system, and even then them like the rest of the world benefits from the medical research. 
The USA pays more per capita, yes. But they also have the absolute best care in the entire world. Also in many single payer like systems courts can decide whether one lives or dies, regardless of any possible treatment. If you have the money you ought to be able to try any bloody treatment you want.

That is simply wrong, nothing more to say.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:57:06
Your the one who believes they are entitled to other people's money, not me.
Unless you're saying I grew up rich or some other entitlement. No I grew up to a single mother for most of my childhood without a dime to my name.

Debt = slavery? 
Are you some kinda commie?
I mean you can declare bankruptcy, and what your a free man then?
