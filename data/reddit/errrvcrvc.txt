Again I'm very new so my opinions aren't too expert, but some people are already saying mining is not profitable, slowly but surely this will become the concusses until the point where you lose money by mining (electricity costs plus wear to "rigs" will out weigh any gains).  I believe at this point the exchange rate for bitcoins will fall into place with whatever your local currency is.   And at this point i believe it might start acting like a real currency because people cant "print" their own money anymore.
For example if you can buy item A for X of your dollars then you wouldnt be willing to pay more for bitcoins than it would you to match the cost (hope thats clear).  The fact that it is a worldwide currency will come into play and cause some fluctuations, but i believe over time it will become pretty stable.  And because you can no longer print your own money it will become a real currency instead a investment

I'm pretty new to using bitcoins, but i think a lot of people are basically just trying to stock up with the assumption the exchange rate will keep increasing over time, so for a lot of people its more of an investment rather than a currency right now.
edit: I also think in general people are using bitcoins to make money, so lets say its $5/bitcoin.  It would make sense for me to pay 20 bitcoins for something that costs $100 in a store, so im not making any money, but if i could get the item for 16 coins now im getting somewhere.  Again this somewhat ties into my "more of an investment than a currency at this point" theory
