Once it gets to the private banking scale, interbank networks will become the pushed norm, and that'll suck a lot of the retail trading away with it. 
That's a mischaracterization of JPM's silver short; it's a shitty legacy book they got from Bear. Bad legacy books are half of bank commodities right now. I'm not sure what naked shorting has to do with this; this can be done independent of infrastructure if the right margin mechanism is in place. if that mechanism is implemented by anyone it will attract enough attention, and not just from banks.

This is a confusing comment -- currency pairs can absolutely be investments
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:24:16
Unfortunately, that's not the case in real market terms.
You can absolutely destroy BTC's value as a currency of use by anybody who wasn't using it a couple of years ago, it's just a matter of effort and magnitude
This is about liquidity, not price
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:26:29
oh, honey....
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:03:55
No, in general you introduce fear by removing liquidity. 
In this case, it's done by driving the price down. The liquidity freeze in the BTC economy you'd see in this situation would be staggering. You have an ideological horse in this race, so you'll keep buying -- that doesn't mean the store down the street will keep taking them. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:22:04
Very noble, but a touch unrealistic. The point isn't to keep the price down, it's to introduce enough fear into the system to disrupt BTC liquidity on a systemic basis. Your BTC can either be traded for other currencies or used in a BTC economy -- it is not difficult for the Fed to take away the second option.
It is interesting that you mention gold; gold manipulation over the last year has been largely successful -- ES GC are at parity FFS. If you're long gold right now, *you're* the one fighting the market -- just because you're right in that it'll recover ground doesn't make it a good long without a lot more information about vol and duration.
Calling BTC a global currency at this point isn't very meaningful -- it's a global currency if the Fed doesn't have the buying power to make a unilateral move against it, and it does. If your implication is that Chinese and Russian banks are buying up BTC as a reserve currency of any politically significant magnitude, well... no

"shorting" means short selling. This usually means borrowing an asset to sell it (with plans to repurchase it later to return the loan), although the concept of "naked" shorting also exists -- in this case, no loan is made.
Leverage (margining) is just another way of saying you're borrowing money, usually from the broker (although in the case of futures contracts, most of the margining is done by the exchange/clearinghouse). In real currency markets, the vol you see on a daily basis is a few pips (1 pip = .0001) and to capture those moves in size, you tend to lever up 50-100x (borrowing 49-99x of what you actually own in cash)-- this seems like a lot, and it is, but when the moves are small enough, it's just like trading a (controllably, by whoever clears you) more volatile asset class. At this point though, mistakes hurt -- if you're levered even 10x, it only takes a 10% move to wipe out your equity (1/10*1000%=100%)
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:18:19
lol even worse
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:55:34
well, no, that's not going to work if you want to grow the bitcoin economy. People with real money need to be able to feel like they can transfer BTC for USD very easily and liquidly -- you might disagree on how important that ability is, but that doesn't matter. So prices (and more importantly, liquidity) are very important
I'm not sure a number-of-businesses metric makes any sense at all -- a better measure would be the ratio of non-exchange to exchange BTC transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:42:46
Sorry but I disagree -- that's not how VWAP accumulators work. They don't need to buy up the whole market, just enough to sell the vol. There's not even a guarantee that JPM buying isn't what's driving this current rally...

More of what? Margining requirements? Obviously the big futures exchnanges (CME &amp; the ICE (and their subsidiaries)) follow a pretty standard performance bond template. Securities (equity/FI &amp; derivatives) are either governed by Reg T or negotiable Portfolio Margin requirements.

This is an emotional investment for you and yes, bitcoin is an idea that'll clearly be around for a long time, but in order to function as a currency, it needs the faith of people who aren't ideologically invested in it doing well. 
It is easy to scare large groups of people into making bad decisions -- I'm not saying you in particular are going to panic and sell, just that you wouldn't need to.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:49:41
So this is just something I drew up while watching screens
Recall that the Fed's current policy of "printing money" doesn't involve directly adjusting the value of every dollar on the book; they  monetize debt. They create more money supply to buy UST and effectively lower rates. The key word here is "buy": the "OMO" in "POMO" stands for Open Market Operations. They're not doing anything you or I couldn't theoretically do (anybody can buy UST) but they have as much money as they want to create to buy with.
In the same way they monetize debt, they can demonetize any commodity, including BTC. The fundamental rule of market manipulation is that if you don't care about how much you spend, you can do anything to any price.
In my scenario: JPMorgan accumulates a large BTC position. This can be done using minimal impact algos (VWAP is the one I picked) without *too* much notice. Goldman does the same.
JPM gets free insurance on that in the form of a swap with the Fed. This means that any future increase in the exchange rate will be paid in dollars by the Fed to JPM. 
The Fed enters into a repo deal with JPM, lending USD in exchange for JPM's BTC as collateral. This means that JPM will buy the BTC back at market rate tomorrow.
The Fed writes a free At the Money put to Goldman, giving GS insurance on their position.
Fed takes JPM's BTC and hits every fucking bid it can get to -- massive vol, prices shatter, panic selling etc. Depending on the size of the position, it could be an absolutely deadly blow, especially if they hit it in waves.
Goldman sees prices fall, exercises its put and sells BTC at the strike price.
Fed pays a lot of money for the now mortally wounded BTC; they don't care, they have a printing press.
Fed takes those BTC and sells them back to JPM tomorrow to settle the repo deal. Depending on mark-to-market procedures (lots of fuckery about this on repo desks...), they might be overpaying drastically, and that's why the Fed does them the free swap - this puts loss limits on JPM and Goldman makes a profit, ensuring participation (most important part).
Realistically, JPM and Goldman (or whatever two firms) will want a more even handed split on their short BTC deltas

@_date: 2013-04-07 21:41:16
No limit -- as much as they can get away with. They do $85 bil a month in POMO, this would be a drop in the bucket if they do it early on. I cannot imagine a world in which commerce in BTC (and in any arbed cryptocurrency) would continue if this happened.
edit: the coolest part is since they're pushing more money out to the banks than they take in, they could actually just call this part of QE! reverse reverse QE

The question was about 1000x current market cap. Why are you looking at "the crash" (which was a blip) as an indicator of what a developed market would look like?
The point of the discussion is to point out that the "exchanges" you listed aren't going to be the ones doing the trading when that level arrives -- at that point, you're talking about interbank FX networks and  real exchanges (ICE will be the first to offer BTC futures)

this is a pretty typical kneejerk reaction to "day" trading, which usually means any human trading that people don't like.
anything involving quantifiable risk is "gambling" -- even operating a casino is gambling. The point behind successful trading is to construct a positive expectancy trading model that you can say with some confidence level is consistent with backtests/market regime. The *point* is to have some winners and a ton of losers because your probability breakdown is designed that way. Same way you run a casino
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:49:00
This is true when you discretely sample it in a vacuum, but not in a real market.

These are all really good points, rcpinchey. in my experience, this community is very committed to the idea that because the math/code checks out, bitcoin is guaranteed to work out as expected. Unfortunately, real markets don't always work that way and a lot of the smartest people on paper get wiped out by their own ideological convictions.

Kind of misleading comment -- deliverable goods aren't "securitized" into futures, they're traded for forward delivery. The contract itself has a contango value (futures price - carry adjusted spot price) but that doesn't mean you're issuing a new asset against a pool; you're just pricing a forward.
Outright futures contracts are delta one. There's no discernible difference between trading spot BTC on the exchanges vs trading fully-cleared tulip futures; there's still an implied forward curve  (vol and interest rates; storage is obviously less of an issue here). The point of the futures market is to manage quality risk and to lock in a future price. This is especially true in the case of the tulips wherein short selling was banned. 
The real issue here is margin and clearing -- that's where the supply/demand imbalance hits square on and and that's why we have performance bonds.  Theoretically, a fully margined futures contract converging to spot delivery can be swapped for a spot position for the delivery date. The Dutch were awful about this though; no margin system at all.  People over-levered and were wiped out in an instant because they were playing the pennies/steamroller game. 
There's no delta difference (again, besides the term structure mechanics) between a margined spot exchange and a margined futures exchange; it all comes down to responsible clearing.
For a real world example of this, watch the way CME adjusts its performance bond requirements based on price movements.
