Fun site. Always people asking for this kind of stats around here.  
My two suggestions: 
1.  Find a way to show all info on one page instead of the slider that shows a tiny bit of info for each page.
2. Add some sort of calculator where you can put how much Bitcoin you own and then equates that to how many people's worth of bitcoin that is or whatever.

Problem here is obviously not earning, and it's really not hard to spend it.  Even when buying from merchants that use coinbase you can just use regular bitcoin addresses.  (Well, I say THAT but I've noticed a few merchants that only want you to use coinbase because of what I assume is their attempt to get autopull payments.)

First thing is to make sure that the business owner knows that he won't have a flood of bitcoin users and that he will most likely go days in a row without anyone using it.  Bitcoin users are still a *very* small group.  
Too many times we've seen someone come on here and say something like "I've started taking Bitcoins but have had only 1 customer in a week!"  and get upset that they were "lied" to by whoever convinced them to start accepting Bitcoin.

I wouldn't be surprised if Circle, coinbase, or even paypal themselves would start providing that sort of service in the future.  Even the Silk Road had escrow for that reason (though I never used the site so maybe the details are a bit different).

Alts are made by copying the Bitcoin coin, changing a few numbers, then mining a bunch for yourself and a few friends.  Then you try to get the price up and sell.  
Alt coins do not do anything different than Bitcoin and, thus, have no reason to exist.
As a merchant or user, there is no reason for me to try and accept more than Bitcoin. It's universal. All an alt would do is add an additional hurdle and require a middleman which is what we are trying to get away from.
Let's say I use Bitcoin but someone wants to send me some Memecoin. Well, either I have to make a new wallet it just for the new coin, or exchange it, or whatever. If I exchange it then I'll have to pay someone some fee for the service. Why not just give me Bitcoin to begin with?!
One arguement I see from altcoiners a lot is trying to compare their alt vs. bitcoin like a company. "If a new shoe company starts up it doesn't make my Nike worth less!" or something. What they don't understand that, in a sense, is that it actually does. If you think of a market as a single pie (Number of people who need to buy shoes) and if Nike was the only shoe company they would be able to get all them shoe dollars. If a new company starts then Nike loses some of that pie because the number of people who need shoes remains the exact same. Same with cryptocurrency.
New alts don't make the demand for cryptocurrency bigger. All they do is make the value of crypto spread out more and make it more thin. This makes the market books for Bitcoin that much thinner.
All the "problems" alts have tried to fix were either not really problems, e.g. confirmation times, or could be addressed within Bitcoin itself. The only reason an alt would succeed is because it turns out there is a problem in blockchain technology and comes up with something completely and radically different than a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:49:46
It's *almost* like every alt is doomed to failure.  Probably because that's exactly what happens every time.

I probably find a way to use Bitcoin about once a week at least (not including tipping). My buying habits def change to support business that support Bitcoin. I buy more from overstock than Amazon now.  I use foodler when I order pizza.  I did a large chuck of my Christmas shopping from stores that take BTC.
When I do spend Bitcion I usually buy back what I spent plus a few percentage.  This way my bitcoin holdings increase while I spend.  I consider this a part of my overall savings plan.

You're right. If someone chooses to get scammed it isn't our business, but it *is* our business to try and warn them.  Every argument in promotion of litecoin has been *destroyed* over and over but the scammers keep repeating them.  A strategy taken right out of the anti-science Creationist handbook.
What's funny is that literally every other alt in the last year has made Litecoin obsolete.  It has no point to exist *except* pump and dump!

I really have nooooo idea.  I just remember him talking about how him and his wife were living in his parents basement and everyone was laughing at him for having Bitcoin or something.  People told him to just wait a bit and the $200 or so right then would be nothing in the long run and he should just sleep on it.
But the guy was just full of drama and self-loathing.  Upset that people weren't showering him with riches for no reason.

Litecoin has zero benefits over Bitcoin. Slightly faster confirm time? Then you should actually want to use one of the other alts that are faster still. That's in addition to the fact that confirm times have been proven to be a nonissue in most cases. The article destroys the silver to gold analogy, though to be fair it never even made sense to begin with so it is odd that it needed destroying in the first place...
Finally, the network effect makes any attempt at an alt pointless barring a huge failure in the system, and since all alts thus far are merely copy/pastes they are shit for "backups" anyways.

It can be considered an online wallet, but you'll want to look into having your own wallet that you control.  If someone else holds your coin then they technically own it.  If you had all your coin saved on changetip and then one day they just up and disappear, your coins will be gone with them.
Most people only keep enough coin on changetip to handle tipping.  Sorta like how you wouldn't keep all your life savings in cash in your wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:15:07
If you are giving it to a gift as someone then you shouldn't be holding the backup.  If you're afraid the person doesn't know how Bitcoin works and are afraid they will lose it or something then you probably shouldn't be giving them a huge amount anyways.

I still think we're dealing with a huge sell off of stolen/confiscated coin.  When the price was sky rocketing  there were hundreds of thousands of coins locked away behind Mt. Gox and the Silk Road bust.  Now those coins are out there, somewhere, and even a tiny fraction of them being sold on the market can cause a price drop.
Eventually though, those coins will be sold off and with the upcoming reward halving we will begin to see some interesting things.

Since all altcoins are, in essence, just copy/paste jobs of Bitcoin there is no point except trying to cash out when the altcoin of choice "gets big".
For example, many will claim that X altcoin is better because it has faster confirmation times and different algorithm.  But what do they say when a *different* altcoin comes around that is even faster and with an even better algorithm? They say that "that altcoin doesn't count because reason".
At the end of the rabbit hole you find that all that matters is user base size which Bitcoin wins hands down.  
Altcoins do not provide "competition" because, as I said, they are 99% copy/paste.  For a true competitor something would have to come along that is as revolutionary as the idea of the blockchain was.

The size of a block can be and is seen as a resource in and of itself.  Limiting the size of a block means people are encouraged to add miner fees to transaction to make sure their transactions are prioritized and, thus, gives the miners incentive to keep mining.  
No finite block size = less incentive to add fees = less incentive for miners to mine = weaker blockchain

Because cryptocurrency isn't like "fiat" currency.  It's universal.  All an alt would do is add an additional hurdle and require a middleman which is what we are trying to get away from. 
Let's say I use Bitcoin but someone wants to send me some Memecoin. Well, either I have to make a new wallet it just for the new coin, or exchange it, or whatever. If I exchange it then I'll have to pay someone some fee for the service.  Why not just give me Bitcoin to begin with?!
One arguement I see from altcoiners a lot is trying to compare their alt vs. bitcoin like a company. "If a new shoe company starts up it doesn't make my Nike worth less!" or something.  What they don't understand that, in a sense, is that it actually does.  If you think of a market as a single pie (Number of people who need to buy shoes) and if Nike was the only shoe company they would be able to get all them shoe dollars. If a new company starts then Nike loses some of that pie because the number of people who need shoes *remains the exact same*.  Same with cryptocurrency. 
 New alts don't make the demand for cryptocurrency bigger.  All they do is make the value of crypto spread out more and make it more thin.  This makes the market books for Bitcoin that much thinner.
All the "problems" alts have tried to fix were either not really problems, e.g. confirmation times, or could be addressed within Bitcoin itself. The only reason an alt would succeed is because it turns out there is a problem in blockchain technology and comes up with something *completely and radically different* than a blockchain.

This is why I have always said that Litecoin is just the biggest scamcoin.  It solves none of the potential "problems" with BTC but is just more susceptible to pump and dumps.

We have attracted some die hard trolls. Some trolls were so dedicated that they faked being pro-bitcoin, got appointed to mod status, and then came out as anti-bitcoin.  These mods have stayed mods because they have created a narrative that if they are removed from modship that is "censorship" and proves that this subreddit is a "circlejerk".
So now people are afraid to say good things and trip over each other to upvote obvious trolls in attempts to prove how non-circlejerky they are.

I think you give Ron Paul a bit to much credit.  The whole goal was to garner that sweet donation money and keep enough of the fan base pumped to keep the money machine flowing.   Do you think that if he really believed he had a shot he'd stay within the Republican party?  That's just laughable.  
He's served as a template for other celebrity politicians who take it even a step farther.  They send out emails and have rallies where they ask for you to fund their committees or think tanks or whatever and put on the air of a campaign, but they never actually campaign for anything.  See Sarah Palin in the early days of the 2012 election.  She raised  a decent amount of money without actually *running*. Impressive.

There is no logical reason for there to be a "silver" for bitcoin.  Silver exists because is literally has different physical properties that give it different use cases and, thus, value. For Bitcoin and the like, they are based of math and numbers. Numbers are numbers.
All the alts that claim to be the crypto-silver fail to understand this.  Why would two identical systems exist? Litecoin, dogecoin, flappycoin, fedoracoin, don't actually offer a single different solution to anything.

Litecoin has always been shit. 
Lol, never change LTC crybabies
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:09:46
You'll get a lot of different answers on this, but my perspective is such:
For most cryptos, I would look at trade volume before price to see how "real" the prices are.  Something that is worth $100 each but only trades a couple bucks worth is, at best, worthless.  All cryptos outside of BTC and maybe Ethereum and maybe maybe Litecoin are subject to easy manipulation by a handful of people.  
When BTC goes up in price it is seen as good for all cryptos since it is the biggest, most traded, and generally seen as the most reliable.  If ChikenNuggetCoin goes up 400% in an afternoon, who cares?  It means nothing, has no history, no volume, no use case, no dev team, nothing.

Of course, when the price is going up they just shrug and say that it'll go down eventually anyways.
It's frustratin' out here.

It's an article about Bitcoin that is published by a fairly large new agency.  It is your responsibility as a Bitcoin user to at least be semiaware of what people outside your bubble are saying. Besides, Bitcoin is tumbling right now. Is it going to forever? No. But it is right now.
But please, go ahead and continue embarrassing yourself by acting being shrill and childish.  Keep name calling and ignoring the outside word.

I thought it was kinda interesting because I didn't feel this dump was particularly bad, so was a bit surprising that it is the worst in two years. You can also read that as "best buying opportunity in two years".
Other interesting tidbit in article: The week saw Bitcoin lose 10bil in 'marketcap' and "That’s a loss just a little under Twitter Inc.’s TWTR, -1.13%  market cap of $12 billion."  You can still learn things from articles that have headlines you don't like at first.

First time I went, the waitress told me that "Bitcoin was down at the moment." after asking her co-workers about it.  
The second time I went, the waiter just straight up said he didn't know what I was talking about and needed to use cash or card.
After a month they took their sticker down and the owner, who was actually there the third time, said he stopped because "No one was even paying in Bitcoin."
