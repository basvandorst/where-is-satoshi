Didn't plan on it. Was more of a thought exercise. I figured 4 BTC would make a bit more than I did in 2017 purely through growth. I understand its not sustainable and I have proper retirement savings in line separate from this. Planning a 4% SWR for those investments.

There is a safe rate. With the S&amp;P 500 its about 4% to not eat into principal.

Finally some reason in this thread... Gives time to save some money for the wedding and trip. We waited a year after our marriage to go on the honeymoon. It was a lack of vacation days at work and money. Paid cash for a trip overseas for 2 weeks. Shit was awesome!

my CU refunds any fees at the end of the month. I typically make 1-2 atm withdrawals per month, but agree with OP.

Seat heaters... Who needs those in general.

I live in cold areas. I'm not a pussy though. I can tolerate a cold butt for a couple minutes. Like one of the other replies said... swamp ass. No thanks.

Because the other 80% is busy making nikes or field stripping their ak-47s?

PSU rating or actual consumption? With my 580 cranking out the heat my computer was at 1/3 of that, including monitors and a speaker system.

I found a tutorial online that will block incoming connections from other countries. I noticed a few connections from various problem countries as they tried to hammer my SSH port (Open because linux box) and now port 22 simply drops anything that didn't originate from my own country. Agreed that the bare minimum should be exposed if nothing else opening more ports than needed lets an attacker easily profile your machine in order to run specific attacks against it.

Jesus chris you can't just add a food word to a crypto word and hope it's worth something.

Oh, at least that much inequality. I could see those that don't have a more mainstream currency embracing crypto though.

If nothing else replacing your leased equipment should pay for itself in a year and save you money overall. I run a commercial grade router, use a simple cable modem provided by my ISP at no charge, and a standalone Power-over-Ethernet WAP because my router is in a sub par location for wifi coverage. The router offers VPN, VLAN, QoS and dyndns features as well. It also allows me to configure static leases for DHCP clients like my printer, linux server and anything else without having to edit the settings on each device.
