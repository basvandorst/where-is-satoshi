If Bitcoin is worth $2000 usd by 2020 everyone should be thrilled

And if you are up to no good just make sure it's a lot of volume and they'll let it fly

Amazing those machines still have customers they should put a pay day loan guy to hit up anyone who uses one

I asked a HODLer friend to send me some Bitcoin for USD time sensitive purchase that I couldn't get from my exchange in time was willing to give a convince fee. They refused, must think of it like a lottery ticket with no real use.

Gold is also used to make circuitry.  
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:49:23
Very good point.  Also people must think gold isn't used to make things why the downvotes?

Do you remember the other multiple %75 crashes in value.  It's hardly a manipulation rather the cycle that it goes through.

You trying to explain that Banks do any kind of community good by saving us from the dark ages of unstopped random robberys is a waste of time.  These people would jump on any boiler room sales pitch.  
Bitcoin is a useful tool.  The people in the sub are just off the deep end

You have a great handle on how socks work.

And anyone else who wanted to make money should have bought at that price too.

Hey look I get it.  You want to win the lottery with no work.  The people who work for crypto are doing well I know people who have been involved in a bunch of ICO's I've used Bitcoin for it's purpose that gives it it's value.  People who think it's an asset don't understand.  Enron was the first to invent"Netflix" and that guy from tripod invented the pop up ad.  Tech history goes quick and you think you've found the gold mine.
I'm not telling you to stop or your wrong but lying to the people like your hacker prank counter part is arguable worse.
Have fun put what you don't need in crypto.  It can go to the Moon and just as easily to 0.  There are securitys for real investment.  Not that they can't do to 0 it's just that they rely on a lot more systems then the pure hope of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:47:32
What if this same logic was reversed?  Could be the best time to sell coin
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:47:34
The value of Bitcoin is purely based on community trust.  At least fait has a larger community.
Bitcoin has gone on multi year declines before you offer no argument that it won't continue.  
Infact your comment how people are consumed by hacked pranks show how fragile the community is with the tech illiterate market leaving Bitcoin the overrated price will leave.  
Fear not my friend the value of Bitcoin will remain.  If it's worth $100 I can still send it fast and safely across the world for minimal fees!

And all the other people in college and highschool who worked for the dream and fell short to end up with nothing.  I think they are paid too little given the risk

Why would you ever sell a coffee bean if you HODL it's an asset that could be worth more when somebody wants a cup of coffee
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:15:36
It was a reality before now it's looked at like a get rich quick scheme by the 1%
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:12:03
So what your saying is it's got a lot more to lose to reach the standard swing

nothing is real its the matrix; or everything is impulses and then is real.  Either way we are off to the moon
