I don't think that's true. Their terms are very clear, for e.g. "100% of fraudulent charges will be refunded". They can't just go around making a list of exceptions.

To be fair, this is THEIR wealth, not yours. They are a credit card company, they are literally lending you money. It's totally within their right to not lend you money for speculative investments. Same reason you can't buy stocks with a credit card.

Haha, probably true!

I just checked, still expensive as fuck for me to use bitcoin (I'm a simple minded copy, paste, and click kind of guy)

I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a Capitol One shareholder. I totally approve of their actions here with regard to blocking of credit card transactions. We haven't heard yet if they are blocking debit card transactions (which I would agree, they should not do).

Jesus, calm down man.

It's a credit card money. It's not your money, it's theirs. They lend it to you and you are expected to pay them back (hopefully with interest).

I think it's simpler than that. You can buy cryptocurrency with a credit card on the exchanges. Now that the price is falling, a lot of people are probably initiating chargebacks with the credit card issuers saying "I never bought this, it wasn't me, my credit card was stolen, they mischarged me, etc." and trying to get their money back. 
Naturally, credit card companies want nothing to do with this. They want to fund your real purchases, not your speculations. It's the same reason you can't directly buy stocks with your credit card.
If I was a credit card company, I would not let you buy speculative investments with my issued cards, period. Their actions are totally warranted.

Typically, countries with the largest military doe decide the fate of important things.

Well said. 
I don't think any cryptocurrency can or will be widely adopted until a few things take place. One of those things is relative price stability. Just as the US dollar drops by 1-3% each year, I think a cryptocurrency's purchasing power can't increase by more than 1-3% per year, else it is not a useful currency for transactions.

Doesn't the bitcoin network rely on a few large miners that use the power needs of a small country? If so, I think countries could effectively shut it down if they all decided that is what they wanted.

What funny is that fiat currencies /central banks were partially created to prevent "runs on banks" from being possible. Central banks, by being the lender of last resort, could always provide any funds that customers wanted to withdrawal.
Bitcoin was designed to work in the opposite fashion. So it suffers from "runs on the bank." That is ironic and hilarious. I realize a lot of people here hate fiat currencies, but some of their characteristics were created for historical reasons that we thankfully don't really have to experience anymore.

Because it's designed to do that. Also, you aren't expected to keep your money in cash long term. At the very least, you're expected to put your excess money into CD's.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:54
To be fair, this is a reasonable issue, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:59
No one has any idea what the future gold standard cryptocurrency will be. Maybe Bitcoin or maybe not. It might go the way of MySpace or will become Facebook
If I owned an exchange, I would always be changing what currencies are supported to make sure I didn't miss future opportunities.

How did you get this? Shorting bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:00:03
It's weird that gas prices, grocery prices, rent, and all these other things are going up in price in terms of BTC too. Are we being gouged?
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:03:40
You can't buy stocks or bonds with a credit card either. They don't want you buying speculative assets with credit, totally understandable.

If you want Bitcoin to succeed. You need to spend it. Not treat it as an investment.

Bitcoin is a currency used to store and exchange value. Nike is a company that makes products and sells them for profit. You cannot compare the "market cap" of these things.
