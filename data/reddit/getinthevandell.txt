It may be good to get in on SC2, there are murmurs of big, enormous, sweeping changes for Legacy of the Void, the upcoming expansion, such as constructing a F2P model and more. If you get in before the release/announcement of the expansion, you may get a better deal and better opportunity for exposure.
Anyhoo, that being said.. ROI when it comes to marketing is always a crapshoot, and determining the "returns" is always nebulous at best.. especially so since doesn't offer a product, and is simply a community.
Are you targeting an English-speaking audience or Korean? It may be better to look towards ROOT Gaming or EvilGeniuses, possibly, since they retain more notable and visible english players. Korean players are great and all, but they are (generally) not very sociable towards their english fans, and thus don't retain them as easily.
But I suppose if you're looking to invest from pure logic, it may be best to go with DOTA2 or LOL.. but there is a huge, *huge* opportunity ahead. If not with SC2, then with Heroes of the Storm soon after.
EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I love TB and what he does for the game and the scene, but he has a team of only Koreans. It's not super appealing to the western audience, even if it's more geared to succeed than them.

I am so confused as to what's going on and what a double-spend is.
