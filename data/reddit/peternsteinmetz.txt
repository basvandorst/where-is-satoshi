You would think they could answer that basic question and then perhaps go and talk with an attorney. I guess it is now about 10 AM there so they should be able to reach a couple of offices and get the process started.

I am certainly not an attorney, but yes have been watching the Mt. Gox bankruptcy fairly closely. Just hoping they can save everyone some hassle and a lot of attorney's fees, but clearly they have to make their own business decisions.
I don't have much BTC on deposit at Bitfinex, but if I did and heard their plans, I would be on the phone right now with an attorney in their home jurisdiction to get a TRO against allowing any other asset class withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:32:01
Does Bitfinex actually have the assets to cover this magnitude of a loss? That is a fairly basic question and clearly determines the possible solutions here. 
I fail to see how Bitfinex can legally try and treat the customer losses as individualized if Bitfinex had control of the funds.

I believe this could only work for people who hadn't changed the balances in their Bitfinex account since the time the transactions would have been signed. A bitcoin transaction transfers a particular prior output as the input to a new transaction. So if a Bfx user changed their BTC balance in any way, then the old outputs were used.

That is an interesting catch on the modification date. Fortunately we have the internet archive to prove these things. Depending on the terms of the insurance which was offered, it is possible this will make BitGo liable, if adequate notification to all account holders was not provided and if a statement of insurance was still on their website. It would be a tricky legal question and likely litigated.

Right, you can probably undo all trades which were performed with stolen funds. Hopefully the effect of that may help Bitfinex's position overall.

Good to hear you are in touch with counsel. Great job on communication in the midst of this fiasco.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:55:33
But not ridiculous to think that the exchange owned the funds which were being held on deposit for the benefit of creditors.
If Bitfinex held the keys necessary to transfer the funds, then constructively they owned them. While I am not a lawyer, I imagine that is how the court will look at it. 
I know you guys are working with counsel, so I guess they will have the best advice. But if I had significant numbers of BTC at Bfx, that is what my lawyer would be arguing.

If the Mt. Gox bankruptcy is any indication, it is possible that deposits made after the hack might be treated differently. In that case the bankruptcy trustee did refund BTC to someone who had inadvertently  sent BTC to an old Mt. Gox address.

They will have to or the class of creditors which is disadvantaged by any other plan will sue them and force them into involuntary bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:50:15
You will almost certainly need to do an even split of all remaining assets -- you do realize that? 
Otherwise the class of depositors that you are disadvantaging by allowing withdrawals of other assets will sue you and force you into involuntary bankruptcy.
They can probably even get a temporary restraining order to prevent any other withdrawals. I imagine there are holders of substantial BTC deposits contacting attorneys in Hong Kong (or is it Taiwan) right now to do just that.
You can probably save everyone a lot of headache and attorneys fees by contacting a good attorney in your jurisdiction now and figuring out what the bankruptcy split would look like. Then just implementing that. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:12:34
It almost certainly has to be an equal split of remaining assets to all creditors. Otherwise the creditor class disadvantaged by their policy will sue them into involuntary bankruptcy and that will result in an equal split.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:06:39
Appears to be about 20% remaining from other comments in this thread.
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:55:39
They won't be able to do that. The large creditors in any disadvantaged class will sue them into involuntary bankruptcy, if necessary.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:36:47
The main question which pretty much decides it is if Bitfinex has enough assets to cover these losses?
Should be a basic simple question to answer and the answer determines pretty much the available possible solutions.
Perhaps best for all parties here to answer that question. 
Personally I don't see how that could be possible given past trading volumes and likely profit margins, but only you guys know.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:40:58
A very interesting suggestion and would be a triumph of cooperation against thieves, though admittedly also a failure of Bitcoin decentralization.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:30:18
Why would you say "there will be NO recovery and no effort at all to find the stolen coins?"
This is exactly what we are going to ask to court to order the administrator to do, if they are not already doing that. There are other means to ensure an investigation than agreeing to a bad deal like this one.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:32:12


This is extremely interesting. Perhaps you can clarify exactly when you had this information and whether that information would have indicated Mt. Gox had lost customer funds? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:57:00
Well, when there is a large loss, the associated transactions will be de-anonymized in all likelihood.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:46:07
Perhaps some of the "temporarily unavailable" BTC are becoming available again?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:50:17
Now that they will have a trustee, they can be compelled to provide this type of information. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 17:57:13
The reason he will need to is because he filed a request for bankruptcy protection with that US court. The judge has made it fairly clear that if he filed it and wants the courts protection, he needs to show up. 
Failing that the class action lawsuit in the U.S. will proceed.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:52:37
I'm never really a fan of conspiracy theories, however, I must confess that some combination of gag/order BTC locked seems at least possible now. On the same order of likelihood as I lost access to the BTC wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:14:34
Remember, it will likely be a month or more before the court approves any sort of reorganization plan. Thus, while Mt. Gox may be moving BTC around, possibly to prepare or reconcile their books, it is unlikely any any withdraws will permitted until the court approves.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:34:40
Very glad to see that this is being recognized for what it is, a terrible deal for the creditors. Hopefully it will be tossed by the administrator or the court.
Without a full disclosure of what actually happened to customer's funds at Mt. Gox, it is too early to make any decisions. 
I'm very disappointed to see the class action being partly settled like this, as the depositions under US court supervision was  going to be one of the better ways to get to the bottom of all this.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:45:33
If the corresponding bitcoin addresses could be located, possibly using the timestamps, amounts, known Gox addresses and blockchain, it might be quite interesting to try and reconstruct what actually went on at Mt. Gox. 
Perhaps this is naive optimism, but what if it is primarily a matter of their internal accounting is very messed up? For example, per their screwed up records, 750k BTC are missing, but in actual fact, accounting for all the trades et cetera, the losses are much less.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:32:58
My view would be that contract law still applies to the contracts formed by exchanges and anyone else who deals in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:17:49


Absolutely on the money! Love it.

Yes, there is group of us who have a law firm in Japan working on this. We are formalizing the query now. If you want to join us please PM me with your name and email, and I'll put you on the list for updates.
I think there is a good chance the trustee will answer queries or the court will order them to.
