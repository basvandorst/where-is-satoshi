Hi. A restaurant is not an innkeeper nor a campground owner.

Just remember, everyone said they would NEVER drive a datsun again. That Datsun's parent company is a horrible worthless junk of metal and will vanish from America because no one would by them AGAIN.
Everyone's still driving Datsun's. Or in otherwords, where will you go for big BTC volume trading?  Kraken?

Everything about this line right here is what's wrong with the IRS.  We pay insurance to avoid being audited.  What the fuck kind of shit is that
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:38:20
what the hell are you talking about?  that does change the fact because you will believe the next company is trust worthy.  and they might be (e.g. datsun -&gt; nissan) or they might not.  thus, don't say "no one will ever go to that company again" because more than likely they will.

OK psychic, will I have won the lotto by then?  Or in other words, how the mother fuck do you know what bitcon will do to macroeconomics?  If you know, don't others know?  Why is fiat still the defacto currency then?  Has a currency like bitcoin ever been used before? I'm sure there have to be other large, divisible naturally occurring elements that could be used the same way.  No, no, bitcoin is the first.never mind, that is for pointing out something no one else has ever thought off.  Shit, technology is great!

blockchain don't lie.  should have paid again normally and then sued the restaurant in civil court
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:30:27
I'm going with, this story likely didn't happen. 
This is a civil issue, not Criminal.  No police report would have been taken because no laws were broken.  Any lawyer would say Op could sue the restaurant for his loss.
3/5 would read again.

unfortunately oxford is not what defines the law.  fraud is defined as a specific action meant to intent.  What is that specific action?  You need to look up your county/state/federal code to figure that out.

In your jurisdiction or mine?
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:26:41
Right.  Because Datsun is now Nissan.  Still same car company, just a different name.  Gox can very well do the same, infact they are implying that with the leaked documents

What is a $?  Can you provide the amount they are giving away in BTC?

This reply is to you and others who have no real-world business experience.  Sometimes when you are looking to shop around for buyers or to take on a substantial amount of credit you are asked for specific data.  When it comes to exotic assets such as bit coin, creditors are a bit more leery.  What you see here is nothing more than a PR stunt.  You regularly engage auditors when you know a substantial change is forth coming, whether it be certification, sale, lawsuit, etc.  In this case BFX is publicly announcing the audit to quiet some ramblers.
To reply to your last statement, this could very well solve their problems.  This accounting firm will point out all the weaknesses in their model and advise solutions.  In turn, it could help forge a reverse process in which a firm in NYC, the financial capital of the world, defines the structure for crypt o currency asset management. 
This is a *good thing* for bit coin
