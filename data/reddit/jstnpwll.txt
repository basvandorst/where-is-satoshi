It only makes sense to produce chairs (supply) if people want them (demand). The carpenter is not going to flood the market with chairs when nobody is buying for a profitable price. The point of making the chairs is to trade them for the other guys' money, not to simply keep them and hope their existence increases the value of the money he already has.

 Speculative graph for entertainment only!
I noticed the market price pattern of last April/May closely resembles the larger pattern between this past November/March. I copied the graph and scaled it up to match the last progression to see what it looks like if we extrapolate the same pattern again. If the price did follow the same pattern, we'd hit $5k/BTC in February 2015.

This isn't what I said at all. There are two potential ways Google could allow bitcoin payments:
* Remove the restriction for alternative payment methods on virtual goods. I think we can agree this will never happen because Google wants a cut from free apps as well.
* Add bitcoin to their in-app billing service. They added PayPal and still take a cut, why not bitcoin?

It would work, but definitely a work-around (with potential for getting banned if Google doesn't like what you're doing). IAPs are powerful because they happen right in the app itself, which make spending painless. I'm not sure having to leave the app and complete a transaction on an external website would be desirable.

I sold when it reached $1200 in March, then attempted to buy back in when it dipped to $900. Turns out Coinbase had frozen my account and prevented me from buying with the USD sitting in my wallet (but didn't prevent me from selling bitcoins, apparently).

Don't blindly obey anyone who tells you "pay 'your' taxes" or "don't pay taxes". Including this guy.
Do your own research and make sure you are totally and deeply informed. Then make your own decision based on your own understanding and conscience.
Make sure the taxes are really yours before paying them. Or don't, it's up to you. Some would rather opt-in and simply pay the protection money and don't care if they really owe it. 
Maybe they do owe it. But maybe they don't.

This deserves a more thorough reply but if I recall correctly, he wasn't convicted for "false returns"...the IRS never proved that he owed taxes but the court tried to order him to fill out a replacement return claiming he did. (Tax returns are only valid if signed in good faith by the filer.) It was a corrupt trial, and he was charged with contempt of court for refusing to perjure himself by signing his name on a tax return he knew to be inaccurate.

You act as though emboldening the term capital gains somehow makes it mean something special. 
Capital gains are just another way to measure "income"--to be "income" (and therefore taxable), the gains must still come from the (profitable) benefit of the exercise of a federal privilege, power or property (which may, of course, be an "exercise by proxy" in the form of an investment in an entity which is doing the "exercising" directly).
There is nothing inherently taxable about using or receiving bitcoin. It's just a medium of exchange like any other. There is no tax on exchanges per se, nor on profits, gains or receipts, per se.
By the same token, however, there is a tax--measurable by the value of bitcoin received--for doing taxable things resulting in those receipts. That is, not all things done for which bitcoin might be received are taxable, but the receipt of bitcoin is relevant to the tax when received for doing taxable things.

Unfortunately for the IRS, "wages" is a narrowly defined term in tax law and doesn't extend to its full commonly-used meaning of "any payment for any labor". There are other terms that are similarly treated, such as "income", "employee", "trade or business", etc.
 All "income" (using the legal term, rather than the common word of the same spelling and pronunciation-- which should always be done when dealing with the subject of the tax) is taxable.  The real question is, what is "income".  Here's a few definitions that convey the general meanings of the terms in tax law:
-Remuneration (either immediate or deferred) paid by the federal government including-- but not confined to-- “wages” (see below);
-Benefits paid by the federal government;
-The proceeds of, and from, federal ("United States") corporations or instrumentalities such as national banks, railroads, etc.;
-The proceeds of, and from, the conduct of a "trade or business" (the performance of the functions of a public office).
('Proceeds' means any form of related payment or gain, including, for example, dividends paid to stockholders, etc..  To invest in an activity is to engage in that activity.)
 
-Remuneration of any kind, and by any name (including ‘salary’, ‘fee’, etc.) paid to any “employee” (see below), and to others in positions in the federal civil or military services.
-A federal government worker or office-holder;
-Workers and office-holders of the local governments of the District of Columbia and the territories and possessions;
-Workers and office-holders of any federal, D.C., or territorial or possessions government agency or instrumentality;
-Officers of any federal corporation.

@_date: 2015-04-13 16:14:18
If so, then props to them.
What are the chances they would lurk around on Reddit to see if their heist gets lots of attention?

Seems reasonable. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:50:02
Nothing yet, I haven't gotten a reply.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:52:18
Right, I meant over the course of time. I discovered this several days after it happened, so they would have had time to get it all.
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:44:45
It is ridiculous to disable 2FA for a whole month. I'm ashamed that I did it.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:24:51
I understand wanting to be sure it's not a new debt. But to disallow me from using my own clearly-sourced money...?
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:16:24
Password for TeamViewer account, and password for remote access to my computer.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:57:47
The difference being, you were probably allowed to use the funds from your paychecks?
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:59:03
They would have to know my TeamViewer ID and password, yes.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:00:11
It struck me as odd.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:09:28
Yeah, the record of devices is still there. The only access for over a year has been from my current IP address and my two devices (laptop and phone).
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:42:46
Exactly, I don't keep money there after buying. The thief did though, which is bizarre.
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:06:13
Yeah, I just wish they'd say "We won't do it, we don't care if there's a law" instead of "There's a law!"
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:48:41
Update: 
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:58:03
Probably a good idea. I'm going to work on migrating my bitcoin related activities to a cheap alt computer with very limited connectivity.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:35:58
Who knows. :\ Might be a good idea.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:32:10
My computer is usually left open and running.
I work from home, so the only people with physical access are myself and my wife. Unless someone broke into our house for the sole purpose of buying a few bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:27:27
Update from TeamViewer support: 
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:49:50
I doubt if this would help speculation at all. I'm not trying to convince anyone, just asking for ideas.
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:14:41
It's the best screensharing / remote login app I've used, unfortunately. :\  I wish it wasn't an attack vector. Or course, by definition the best method for access becomes the best method of attack...
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:02:31
I re-wrote the letter they wanted me to sign to include a blurb about it, thanks for the suggestion. We'll see what they say about that.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:35:01
Probably a good idea.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:01:35
Nice! Congratulations to you.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:19:42
Checked with a Verizon rep and logged in to review my account usage personally. No forwarding occurred or was setup.
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:47:50
Oh thanks
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:23:05
Yep, it sucks. :\
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:56:25
Yeah, I don't understand why it needs documentation if we "aren't going to use it" anyway.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:12:09
**TL;DR** — Never disable 2FA for 30 days, always close your browser session, don't use TeamViewer (or make darn sure it's a secure password &amp; 2FA is enabled)








I have TeamViewer running on my machine. I don't remember seeing the notification that a TeamViewer session had ended, but I suppose it is possible that an attacker used it to access my machine. I don't know how my TeamViewer credentials were discovered.
I sometimes leave my email open in the browser; the attacker could have permanently deleted the Coinbase emails regarding btc purchase and withdrawal.
Apparently I used the "Do not ask again for 30 days" option for 2FA on March 9th, so none was needed on April 6th.
So, this is probably what happened. Not conclusive, but probable.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:06:39


because source of funds is *bitcoin*
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:07:01
It's silly, but that would work.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:18:42
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:52:00
The problem is I didn't know TeamViewer had 2FA. (I may have been on an older version...)
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:52:24
I wish I'd known when they added it. Dang.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:29:28
The full trail is only relevant to money gotten in the past month, apparently. I guess I should have sold earlier. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:52:56
Of course, of course. Don't look behind the green curtain, bitcoin has nothing to do with it!

@_date: 2015-04-13 14:50:13
That's a separate issue, see my original post.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:59:48
Wow. 10 point for simply not giving them information they're going to hamster about.
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:05:00
And what is the origin of USD? Ultimately, it's the Fed where the bills were printed. Except no, it's Congress who outsourced their job to coin currency. Except no, it's my tax money from a prior year. Etc.
The only question is how far removed does the proven source have to be.
And no, they didn't want proof, they just told me "funds from a bitcoin sale are not allowed in real estate transactions". So it really is because bitcoin in this instance.
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:58:08
Verizon. Currently checking to see if anything is amiss.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:10:30
That's a good idea, and should have been more obvious to me before.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:58:51
Exactly. How many steps removed does my proof need to be? Two?
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:36:27
I wonder if they'd be okay with it if I provided my buy receipts. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:50:01
Yeah, I'd be much more comfortable with an in-house policy than a vague reference to anti-laundering laws.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:58:26
Yeah I understand wanting to know the source, just not the part where I promise not to use the "dirty money".
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:11:19
The prior line in our conversation:


@_date: 2015-04-10 15:47:34
Wasn't hodling on Coinbase. Just used it to buy bitcoins monthly and withdraw to my wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:06:13
Yeah we were having a pretty quick back-and-forth until I asked about the law. Now I haven't heard a response in several hours. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:17:10
What about VA?
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:29:34
Maybe, but then they'd have to cover their tracks upon exit as well (i.e. not allow TV to write anything to the log when they disconnect, and not show the session end popup window).
I would also expect someone with such "chops" to do more damage...and certainly to withdraw all of the bitcoin they purchased via my account. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:54:21
Haha, good sleuthing. :P She doesn't know the first thing about bitcoin, she just pretends to listen when I talk about it so that I'll feel valued.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:21:02
I don't think so, but I can't check now since my account is frozen for review. :\
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:13:05
Nope, no one else around, and no clues around my computer. I don't think it was physical access, but I guess I could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:42:55
I don't consider myself my own bank; that fact notwithstanding, if you're implying that bitcoin was the source of my problems, you're mistaken. The problem is that someone hacked my computer and/or stole my identity and **used my traditional bank account to purchase goods**.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:49:32
Update: 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:11:34
But is it money?
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:07:35


I believe what you mean is that bitcoin *shouldn't* have anything to do with it, but in my particular is it does.
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:13:06
I guess I could clarify with them that no law has yet been named, and I'd like to get the name.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:48:57
Update: 
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:09:15
My legal name is Qwerty123456
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:14:45
But the loan officer made it clear that I have enough money regardless. It's not about having enough money, just red tape because bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:08:20
I guess so, they only wanted my last bank statement. That's the only reason they asked about the source of the money. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:22:04
I mean, maybe you're right, but then the loan officer was totally wrong when they told me "funds from the sale of bitcoins cannot be used in a real estate transaction". That's the whole reason I posted here.
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:45:59
Yep. I made a long string of perfect little mistakes, coupled with a bit of luck on the attacker's end.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:17:56
Yeah yeah...I forgot I had it running in the background. :\
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:05:29
Haha, k. I'm glad they realized I need a nanny.
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:07:27
Oh nice, I'm envious!
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:54:10
I showed where it came from, one step removed. That's all that is required for dollars, right? Or is it two steps removed? Maybe three or four?
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:39:50
As noted, I had sent them my local log files. I've reached out to the TV Privacy Officer again and asked whether they keep server logs of access and whether they match my own.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:56:45
He's my uncle, Sam.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:50:19
I set them up pre-bitcoin-awareness, so not as strong as they could have been. Still, nothing like 'pass1234'.
