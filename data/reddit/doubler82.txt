If you turned the 100k into actual fiat, then you owe on 50k, if you kept it on the exchange, like USDT, then you owe nothing.

Great way to sell a useless hard drive, it's up to $42 lol. I have 3 drives from 2010 in my closet, I should sell those with the same description,  maybe I mined bitcoin in my sleep back then, my loss your gain!
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:19:44
There's also a decent chance that it can drop back to 3k or even lower. I think it's a good time to cash out right now, had it been 5k then I'd agree to hold.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:30:41
buy 5k now, buy another 5k tomorrow if it dips or not.

This is crazy, the majority of Americans don't know shit about Bitcoin, let alone used it, and we have internet access everywhere from damn near anything. Cuba has much bigger issues to tackle right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 08:17:50
Decent read. What scares me is the crazy amount of crypto out there all doing the same thing. Other than Bitcoin, I don't see why some coins are still worth so much. It's so easy to create them, that if a company like Amazon wanted in, they would never make someones random coin the preferred payment, they would just make their own coin. Would make 0 sense to  give some Joe Schmoes so much power over their finances.
I am a holder of Bitcoin and NEO, but almost daily I think they are still highly overvalued and would not be surprised if they dropped much further, especially altcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:31:41
Update: Opened a case with Paypal the same day, surprisingly they settled in my favor yesterday. Didn't think transactions like these were covered, but he had plenty of time to contest it and obviously didn't. Anyway, it was a small amount, but enough to feel stupid about it lol

Too much red, time to Tether!

Thing is, there is only a certain amount of Bitcoin available at these prices.

Hey, at least you got a home out of it. Do you know how many of us knew about Bitcoin in 2013 and prior and did nothing about it? That's even worse..
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:34:56
True, He said he's in need of money now though. Although kind of a rip-off, based on your requirements, an ATM may fit your needs.
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:53:17
Yeah it's getting pretty ridiculous, especially right before and after it hit 9k, only for it to drop right back down.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:30:24
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:57:45
I think if it hits 10k, 11k will follow eventually...
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:16:58
That's only really relevant to people who were trading when Bitcoin was much  much cheaper and easy to multiply. However, for those who started in December/January, hodling has been brutal.

Yep, the real men took profit at the top. The boys were too scared and greedy to sell for more and are now holding bags.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:16:30
Profit is profit, if you increased your stack by making moves, then I'm all for that. In 2018 however Fiat is definitely not for suckers.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:09:13
The price is very much relevant. These dramatic price swings will slow any major adoptability to a crawl.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:11:18
It's not panic selling if it keeps going down. What about panic holding?
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:07:29
I tend to agree with you OP. I never understood the great dislike I've seen on this sub towards people who try to cut their losses, or trade. Everyone's investment risk and goals are different. A healthy market will still do what it's going to do. If anything, it was likely weak hands that drove the price to the 20k and got left holding bags by long term hodler's taking in a nice healthy profit. Now I see them get $hitted on every time they want to cash out because they want to stop the bleeding.
These type of comments calling people weak hands, idiots for buying ATH, or stupid for risking more than they were comfortable losing, are going to push new potential users far far away, especially in this bear market.
Me, I consider myself a hodler and day trade when I get in the mood. I definitely switch to USD when my TA tells me it's about to go down, with a stop limit to buy back in quickly if I'm wrong of course. It's definitely help me cut my losses after the quick run up to 9.8k and back down to now.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:34:57
I swear, Bitcoin will drop 1k and then go up $200 and all the bear market is over articles appear. I'm convinced the spikes are caused by bots or manipulation into traps.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:05:24
It's already a currency in the pen. Time to get in cheap, maybe?
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:22:30
I don't see the problem with it either.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:29:27
I hate the zooming out argument. Only used to convince yourself to keep hodling. If anything it tells you to sell now and wait for the uptrend to begin.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:29:16
After more adoption, it will eventually just happen on it's own. Too many coins owned by too few people, still not super difficult to manipulate the price. The swings have gotten less dramatic than they were years ago though.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:08:38
Good advice, thought only I asked myself at the register if I really need this. You'd be surprised how much goes back.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:08:09
A two dip sample size is not very encouraging. Going by the last dip, it looks like we're heading much lower for longer.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:01:29
Just because it was designed that way doesn't mean it's not a problem now and even bigger problem in the future. This will always be a major setback when it comes to mass adoption, which I thought everyone was hoping for. You want everyday businesses to accept it but it doesn't make sense for the majority of them because of the fees and wait times. Without mass adoption it's going to always be the same people in crypto and we'll be stuck in these same pump and dump patterns for who knows how long.
@_date: 2019-12-11 07:43:07
What if I ran a really long extension cord to my neighbors power outlet?
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:26:36
So you're saying there's a chance!
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:06:49
Not for everyone, but I'd rather day trade and gamble with some riskier moves when only dealing with a couple hundred dollars until I got to $1,000+. Longterm investing 100 or 200 sucks, even if it 2x in a year, it's not much at all. I'm also a gambler lol.
I started with $400 in January, made a newbie move that paid off by going all in on TRON and XLM and grew it to $1,100 in about a week. Lost about $200 of that gambling on shitcoins, but Now Im just in Bitcoin and NEO Hodling until we get back to 11,000..
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:22:50
according to analysts that's possible by the end of the year ...
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:20:14
lol What? even at 10.1k you're already in profit. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:22:40
same, I hadn't even realized how much more in fiat it had dropped this last day. ouch. Any particular pairs?
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:46:20
Nope, that's what I was saying. I cut my losses days ago and just gonna finish watching it settle down, I'll jump back in once the bloodbath is over.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:36:35
What if you're trading with tethers and not converting to fiat? Either way, I would be happy to pay taxes on a 10k profit than less taxes on 1k profit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:48:44
Ha, say what you say but you don't have to be an expert to notice that it's been free falling hard.
I switched to the hated USDT over the weekend and came back today to get everything at a massive discount. I'm still down in fiat overall, but in much better position than if I had just stayed put.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:28:38
What I meant was, person A made 1k holding, and person B made 10k day trading, if you were good at it and day trading was going to net you more profit than holding, then who cares about having to pay more in taxes. Sure your tax bill would be lower if you just held, but if your tax bill is high, it's because you made that much more money. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:50:06
This is crazy, I don't think hodling is worth it right now. Many say to just hodl, it will be back up, it's just a correction. Also, that the cause was new money and fomo that caused the spike, at the same time, those same new people panic sold and had weak hands. This kind of contradicts the it will be back up argument. Why? those fomo buyers are likely gone forever now since they likely lost a ton of value and confidence in crypto. Unfortunately it looks like it will be a very very slow crawl back to 20k. The dips are so obvious now, you can just cash out, wait a bit and easily increase your position. Unless you expect it to spike again really soon, you can just wait on the sidelines until the dust settles and buy back in. Just my opinion. I had to stop the bleeding a few days ago and can buy back in now with even more crypto, but those all time highs were artificial as hell.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:00:23
This is the type of  thinking that keeps hurting Bitcoin. At the ath everyone was saying how much greater it is than Fiat and how it's going to change the world and will be 100k by the end of the year, everyone should get in while it's cheap and will overthrow the banks. Fast forward, now everyone is silly for buying at the top and it was due for a correction, this is totally normal, -70% later, hodl hodl hodl.. the greed is strong on both sides,  new investors trying to get rich, and old investors hodling to sell to the next highest bidder. Then you have the "I'm doing it for the tech" people, who will the ones left holding bags.  Let's face it, the Bitcoin community is not that great and will keep Bitcoin unstable for a while. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:09:30
10 cents a day? You can't even feed a starving child on that. Only $3 a month. Even worse after electricity cost. Gotta set higher goals than that, man.
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:46:56
Still a bad analogy since there are several ways to get your groceries without a car and without spending a dime. The only way I can think of getting small amounts like $20 with minimal fees, is if you know someone with Bitcoin, you can give them cash and they send it to your address in a cheap altcoin and then you convert to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:18:54
I'm an idiot. I fell for it. Same user. Before doing the math, I assumed it was close to an even amount after fees and he likely wanted to avoid the whole exchange/bank stuff so I didn't think much of it for $20. But he stopped responding as soon as I sent it. *face palm*. I already contacted Paypal about it, so we'll see how that goes.
Small loss, still annoyed
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:03:51
From under a $1 to $20 is greater than the run to 20k percentage wise,  but the latter is much harder to achieve since it requires a lot more money. It's not as easy as it happened before so it will happen again.

"And tanked in under 5. Brenda bought more thank she could afford to lose. Don't be Brenda."
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:33:51
I don't understand why people don't think it's ok to be upset that the price has plummeted. Sure they shouldn't have bought high. But it's a real concern. The majority of people want Bitcoin to succeed to make money, otherwise there would be much less interest. Hodling isn't always the answer and others get rich off them holding too long.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:12:15
Doesn't really mean much. For one, population has increased and now that news and information travels instantly people are able to adopt to everything much quicker than ever before.

Very true. Don't forget about the expiring futures too. Everyone had an explanation. It was supposed to bounce back for 3 months now. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:30:14
It was bound to happen, That's why I don't get all the hype posts everytime it crosses a price. It's going to be a steep climb since many are going to be selling a lot on the way up. The current bear run messed with people's heads.

@_date: 2018-04-24 05:19:44
Can't he just buy back in now and still be ahead?
Why do so many redditors that are not in it for the money absolutely hate when others take profit early? IMO he sold way too early, but who cares, there has to be buyers and sellers. After the rise to 20k and fall to 6k, I understand. Taxes are over exaggerated since you only get taxed when you make a profit, reading these subs would have you believe that you get taxed win or lose, or some crazy unheard-of tax %.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:54:26

This is crypto, you already know as soon as you buy, it's going to drop just to piss you off more. Seems to always do the opposite. Your call, nobody knows.
