there's no use for any alt coin.. they're testing grounds for ideas to implement into bitcoin. That's it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:10
Please, tell me how Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme. I'll be here waiting.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:38:40
nah bro we just been hodling.. there was nothing exciting to talk about.. but LN is HUGE.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:09:53
but it won't, far to much wallstreet and SV money involved now and the technology actually solves problems, like email. Do you seriously think the CBOE, Nasdaq, etc are getting involved in a dieing techonology? No, we're just getting started.  It took nearly 30 years for email to become usable by your grandma.. The first email was sent 48 years ago.. When did email become a popular form of communication?
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:48:48
What would you like to see?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:16:25
ask the guys that hoarded domains how they're doing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:34:56
The difference is huge here though... Napster wasn't secured by the network effect.. Shitcoins are insecure because there isn't a big enough network of users. In this case first mover advantage created an enormous mote none of the other coins will ever cross.
Without the security of the network, blockchain tech is useless. People seem to think that crypto is just magically secure. Most people don't even know how a fee for a transaction is calculated in sat/bytes so I can't expect them to understand how bitcoin is secured.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:59:55
no, you just buy more and average down.. if you're all in, you've already fucked up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:30:06
Bitcoin is open source.. if something so much better comes around that is a "bitcoin killer" the community will just adopt it into the source code, we'll fork and keep on keepin on.
First mover has HUGE advantages.. Do you think WoW is so much better than all the MMO? or was it because it was most peoples first MMO that it has been impossible to dethrone?  How's the MMO market been since WoW came out?
Bitcoin is here, bitcoin is NOT going to be dethroned by any other currency. It would take consenses from the crypto community and that shits never going to happen. If bitcoin dies, all crypto dies w/ it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:39:14
OH YES! This is actually huge. This gives millineals super easy access to bitcoin. They loved Snapchat. They're going to really love being able to buy bitcoin commission free.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:00:26
there's a reason why.... no one wanted this trash it seems.

Locked and Loaded LETS GO! Never been so ready in my life to BTMFD
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:10:05
i bought some around 7800 and 8200
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:05:39
oh you're one of those guys... late to the party, so bitcoin is gonna be "killed"... and can't change things?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:17:37
i'm just buying all my favs right now.. i mean, I scooped up BTC, ARK, ADA, ETH...
Buying up ADA at 16-18 cents.. YES PLEASE. When you want to puke on your shoes? YOU BUY!
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:17:18
i buy a bit of silver still every time it drops below $15.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:04:18
and that's why most of them buy high and sell low then bitch they never make a profit.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:19:36
Well, that's the same for anything w/ value.. when people lose faith, it drops... Even FIAT, Baseball Cards, etc.

This is a bot.. This message is being reposted over and over by new accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:57:49
how is this huge? Bitpay did this like a decade ago.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:27:33
Coinbase and sites like Earn are still charging customers enormous fees in regards to requirements.. a lot of this is probably coming from them.. I paid $1+ at coinbase the other day to transfer.. it's bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:38:06
considering that bitcoin neither closes nor opens... I see what you did there.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:59:29
ya these people are idiots... i buy every week regardless of price and just hodl.. worked fucking beautiful.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:51:05
I love how people think the blockchain is worth anything without Bitcoin. Without the security of Bitcoin, the blockchain is worthless. This is why altcoins are worthless. Because NONE will ever have the security of bitcoin. If the security of Bitcoin fails, ALL COINS WILL FAIL.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:24:10
There are few with a CS degree who can develop a self driving car in their garage bro. What are you on about?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:55:20
not sure.. way bigger problem than i'm prepared to solve.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:02:10
thank you for the laughs... i legit laughed out loud.. i'd buy you gold, but fuck reddit. have a reddit silver.
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:18:14
you're very wrong about that.
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:10:53
i'm buying. 10yr hodl
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:25:26
nothing requires anything... college is for kids who need someone to read to them. Most of the smartest people to ever live never had a "PhD"... this is just bullshit people spew that feel the need to justify the enormous amounts of debt they've collected getting a worthless degree.

As a person trying to build software if there was some way I could setup to take drip investments in my startups I most certainly would(something like patreon but where people actually receive shares and dividends, etc.)
Someone might night have 1k to give, but they might have $10/wk or month.. and they should have just as much a chance to invest as anyone.. and with technology why not? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:31:17
so people should loan you money for free? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:39:17
doesn't change what I say.. If there's pachinko there's more.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:00:34
windows enabled them to get on the internet and use bitcoin, therefor windows is to blame.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:27:55
you're not here for the crypto.. you're here for the fiat.. which is why you clearly don't understand anything about what you're involved in, and that's ok we need you too.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:58:16
I'm saying that you make no sense my dude.. Few people have the resources and capital required to build a self driving car in their garage. CS Degree or Not. The degree is not whats stopping people, i can assure you that.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:31:46
This scam is straight out of EVE online.. It's fucking amazing it's working in real life now LOL.. Jita has come to real life.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:01:14
Without the security of the network, the blockchain has no real value. Without bitcoin, there is no security.

Gambling is "Illegal" but they have loop holes just like anything else.. 
Pachinko parlors where you win prizes then go down the street and sell the prize for Yen. For the most part, this guy has no clue what he's talking about. Signed - Former Japan Resident.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:57:40
of course not, i'm just saying this type of thing should be possible.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:11:41
just buy and hodl.. are you really that worried about a few hundred dollary doos? I snapped up a full bitcoin below 6500.. was a steal..
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:14:26
100% true.. No college degree, full time developer.. Just need a will and the ability to teach yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:10:37
if your business was funded through a distributed ledger you might.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:32:33
i sent a $5 transaction today for 6 cents in the first block.. YAY!
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:16:32
Here's a cold hard fact. There has never been a country survive indefinitely. 100% of countries have failed up until this point in history. When those countries die, their currency becomes worthless.
I'll bet on those odds what I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:34:15
great, he'll probably ruin those like he did Reddit. Him and Spez would make a great team.
