correlation does not imply causation.  MM control the action and act when they are ready.  This market just reacts wildly differently because everyone is automatically an "institutional investor" in crypto.

60% of the time it works every time ;)  Some of my biggest wins have been when i foolishly over extended, but then again so were almost all of my big losses. On the other hand the bulk of my portfolio is now btc I got from selling shit coins I mined in 2014 and parked until last year. My single HD6770 which was losing around $2 a day when I was mining, ended up  being one of the best "bad" decision I've ever made. 
Now the name of the game is diversity and not over extending risk factors that lead to Rekt.

Cant speak for Canada, but in the USA overpaying on taxes is basically a good faith effort, as its been explained to me.  If you declare everything as a gain, then you are technically overpaying your tax obligation, which as far as I'm aware carries no penalty. 
I bought my first btc from Alex Green, through Wells Fargo and was one of the first transactions ever recorded by Moolah.  Unfortunately Alex is now in prison and moolah/mintpal are only distant memories.  I will never be able to prove when I purchase those btc or what the opportunity cost was; and was advised to not factor this into my capital gains, but rather treat every penny transferred to fiat as "earned money".
Now, if you participated in any trading, received any airdrops/chain splits, or participated in mining, then things get a little more complicated.  In the states these are taxed at different rates and different actions are considered taxable events.

Used a variety over the years and I've come to the conclusion that Coinbase/GDAX has been the best for my personal needs. I'm also based in the USA, fwit. The problem the OP has is a common one I hear about often, but what is missing is the vital pieces of info: transaction amount and method of payment.  These variables are most likely the source of you delays. 
Also the outgoing cost of transfers is a larger concern of mine, that Coinbase addresses nicely.  I have easily saved more money by avoiding transfer fees with CB/Gdax over the past year, that my initial investment was into crypto back in the day.

Went to look at a boat and the guy made a joke about accepting silver or gold, so I offered bitcoin.  Came home with the boat and a little less btc.
