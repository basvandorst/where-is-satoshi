Is bitfinex capable of selling equity at a heavily discounted rate in order to quickly raise enough capital to cover losses?

Holy fuck, just got hit in the feels for the first time really when I saw my one and only wallet link colour was "visited".

Bitfinex should do this so they can show everyone how crappy their trading engine performs.

I'll buy someone's PDF of how to do it myself

Is there a setting to prevent the candles from repainting themselves? I'll watch like the last 7 candles all repaint when only the current candle should be repainting.

So bitfinex gets to keep the profit of any coins recovered now that the price is much higher than when they were stolen? Or will they use the profits to fully make whole users who cashed out their BFX.

The point is that it's easier to see the whole thing at a glance instead of having to horizontally scroll

What's the difference between the IRC link in the sidebar and what I've posted here? 
Also, no one can see your IP, not even me. It's like I'm just promoting a twitch channel. It's just a hosted service and I threw a domain mask on it... Sorry about any confusion!
