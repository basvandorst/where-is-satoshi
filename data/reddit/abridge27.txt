This. Every time it drops even more I laugh to myself quietly at anyone who would get so bothered to freak out with random fluctuations. And even if it zeroes out forever who cares then as well? If you think of it as an experimental investment, you'll have nothing to lose. It's a fascinating technology and grand experiment at best. And then if it rises like crazy, all the better. Change your perspective.  yo.

Ps I have most of my btc in localbitcoins wallet w double secure w my authentication app... I imagine that's safer than the Coinbase wallets right?

I think I'm starting to see the bigger picture here. Fiat does seem likely to fall. Esp after what we saw in 2008 and the reality that might only be the tip of the iceberg. The more I think about it, maybe Bitcoin really is the future standard of money. To all the skeptics, I mean yes it's volatile and unstable but so is EVERY other new technology in its infancy. I'm no economist but technology becomes improved upon MUCH faster than slow moving social systems and government policies. Look how slowly and insignificantly capitalism with it's standard monetary system and Federal reserve has improved if at all. So much beaurocracy, corruption and stagnancy preventing it from having any kinds of real progress regarding regulation, checks and balances etc. I can easily see how something as innovative and limitless as Bitcoin will create a new and improved economy. Might take time but I see happening for sure.

Localbitcoins... I had signed up for Coinbase too, so there was some confusion. I literally knew nothing about bitcoin and thought my blockchain.info page which said balance was 0 meant my wallet had nothing in it at the time. Totally clueless 4 yrs ago until I started learning more just the last few days. Not bullshit at all, I'm just a clumsy mofo lol.

Update: Thanks for all your advice everyone. I know its subjective and a totally volatile market. I ended up taking shro70's advice and selling off 1/3 of it, and will let the 2/3s ride. Nothing to lose.

Can you prove you're not a bot? AI is pretty complex these days.
