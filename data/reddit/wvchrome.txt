Are you kidding me?  That's EXACTLY what BTC was designed to do.  Exchanges are essentially "meet up" locations for peers. 
You don't want near instant processing times for your currency?

Then Bitcoin will die.  That's why implementations must be done with the market in mind.  If the market doesn't want something, it won't use/pay for it.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:23:22
It's not about force, it's about incentivizing.  If a user (peer, exchange, institution, etc) doesn't see value in something, they're not going to utilize it. 
So the question must be raised; why wouldn't they be using it?  By looking into that question, the problem can be solved.

No, it's a about how to coerce an entity into compliance.  It may work, until the next one comes along and doesn't use Segwit, LN, or whatever the next feature not seeing full implementation is.

No, I didn't.  If fees do not rise during high traffic, than transaction times likely will.  That's how it works, there is a competitive market for block space.  It's a commodity, and a scarce one at that.  "Bitcoin" doesn't make the decision, no, the market its created does. 
As you can tell by people complaining of transaction times, people value speed.

Yup, I just moved some spare coins around and got it confirmed in ~3 hours for 140sat/b. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:31:45
It's interesting and important, but I don't think it's *more* important than transaction totals pending if you consider BTC as a means of exchange rather than just a store of value. 
Adding this new metric will certainly help spot the claimed spam transactions once a baseline is established.  
I like the idea, shouldn't be difficult to express, either.

Fame, cuck soinbase.

Same, my 140 sat/b cleared yesterday in ~3.5 hours.

I don't know, haven't been following the suspension.  Looks like it stopped just after noon EST. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:08
They've suspended all buys at the moment.

If $50 is a substantial sum to you, you've likely over-invested yourself, even with it only being $50. 
You could cash out $50 to cover your initial investment, then forget about it, if you really need $50 back.

That sounds like money laundering...

Can I get some half price coins soon?
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:52:31
That just sounds like crossposting with extra steps.
