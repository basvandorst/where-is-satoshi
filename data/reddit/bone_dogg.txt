Posts like this one make me feel like I’ve made a mistake getting into this.

I’d rather receive it than reddit gold

You should try to learn the difference between loose and lose.

More like “this guys not selling.”
That’s all I see around here anyway. And nobody cares.

The amount of times I see the phrase ‘blood on the streets’ here is really embarrassing.

Hey asshole, that wasn’t Goku, it was Vegeta.

The first funny meme that I’ve ever seen on this sub
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:00:22
After it goes up a bunch, it will come down again for a while. 
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:06:27
Because it’s still extremely inconvenient and unintuitive to use as a currency compared to regular money.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:04:14
Don’t use it for it’s intended use? Is that a good sales pitch?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:04:47
I’m sure those 6 people really enjoyed their lunch experience that day.

Can you guys shut the fuck up with this melodramatic hyperbole? You’re not in a warfare scenario. You’re a bunch of nerds watching numbers on a screen. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:56:08
AGAIN with the living dead?
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:56:36
Subtlety is a word, yes. One that that guy used incorrectly. He was looking for subtly. So, you’re wrong as well. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:21:12
The comments in this place are embarrassing. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:17:37
What did just happen to that sentence
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:30:33
No thanks. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:38:51
You sound like a loser. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:51:32


You don’t need the second with.

It’s a hit pop song
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:09:37


but there was nothing subtle about the meme
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:18:37
Gladly. 
Subtlety is slyness. Subtly is slyly. He wanted to say “They took a subtle(sly) jab at our community.” He went with a form of subtle at the end of the phrase, but it should have been subtly, not subtlety. They took a jab at the community, slyly. They weren’t taking a jab at the community’s slyness. 
Reading it the way it was stated and using your own provided definition, it would be “They took a jab at our community state of being subtle.” Does that sound right? It’s like the difference between the words quickness and quickly.

This inspired me to buy more.

Will this sub ever do anything besides jerk itself off?
