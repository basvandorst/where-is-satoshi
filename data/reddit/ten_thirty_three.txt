Are you really asking what to invest in next? 
You could maybe open up an etrade account and have some fun doing something that could translate to a career/hobby instead of playing with stupid internet money /runon

This is a terrible mindset to have little Connor. You fucked up. You didn't read the terms. And now you are telling the community to not buy on Newegg. 
If I say what I should say, I would get banned.

Then you shouldn't own any

OMG is decent, worth taking a risk with. Some users are very high on the ROI.

Great mindset! 
As a matter of fact, most hedge fund managers on the NYSE just whip their dicks out and scream and yell "HODL." It's crazy that it works, it really stabilizes the market and pulls the DOW in the right direction. 
I'm screen shooting your comment because it is that ridiculous. I'm also putting a reminder in my phone 5 years from now and will come back and roast you for this.

It's tough to our day. Typically speaking. Price of gold is inverse to the economy. Simpler terms: economy is sturdy/confident then gold is at a lower price. If volatility is high and there is not much confidence in the future, then gold rises. 
In a perfect world   chg Gold = chg  Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are young and not much data is out there. 
My opiniom: a shitty economy would probably mean a shitty Cryptocurrency market. Time will tell.

They just canceled a fork and look at the market chaos. Get off your decentralized horse.

Yea lemme go ahead and use a currency that takes 10 minutes per transaction. 
How...the fuck...do you expect a merchant to accept such a hideous currency?? 
Online transactions are great! Every other transaction sucks dick. 
Anyways. Proof of stake works with the more people that use it. Time will tell.

I've had a similar question to this. The way the rewards work, typically speaking, are generated from the merchant. For example, American express is known for their "great" rewards. American express typically charges more for merchants to run their cards. American express then takes that revenue and applies it to the consumers rewards. That's where we see things like for every dollar you spend, get a free mile. 
In Short, I would say we are not even scratching the surface on what these currencies can do. That leaves the possibility open. 
Ethereum's smart contracts make this a bit more plausible.

This is incompetence at it’s finest. No more B2C coins! People are jumping ship and moving back to all coins. 
LOL you expect a very bullish future....
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:07:07
I’d probably brace for impact.

You can't get cash back with a credit card. That is called a cash advance. 
You are thinking of a debit card. You can get cash back with a debit card.

You "freaking out" is part of the problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:23:32
I’m on board with you. It’s hilarious you have down votes for stating facts.

Plot twist. Bitcoin is a shit coin. 
Congrats. You played yourself.

Holy shit. The amount of confidence you have in you is disheartening. Research please.

This is actually a busted “grow” house in Amsterdam. I can’t find the original article but OP is full of horse shit.

A great example of why Bitcoin will not be the market leader long term.

I used to come to r/bitcoin for good information. 
Now I just come here for the laughs. These people have no idea what they are putting their money in.
