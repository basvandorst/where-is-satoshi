They are talking about a seed phrase.  It should be twelve relatively common words you would have been instructed to write down for precisely this scenario. 
Some people do not because you only need them to rebuild a lost wallet and if someone finds the phrase, they can recreate your wallet and steal the coin. 
Best of luck.

Thanks for everything.  If bitcoin follows its predicted trajectory, I hope to follow in your footsteps.

Tacodeli is far better than Torchy's.  
I prefer Freebird's over both, but as Chris said, it's a question of if you want tacos or burritos.

Thanks.  I was trying to remember what exactly I gave MtGox to set up the account.  While it would suck to have that information out in the wild, it's not the end of the world.

Ok.  I’ve been keeping my coins in Bread wallet and not really paying attention because it is a long term hold.  
What do I need to do exactly?

Buckle your seatbelts.  It's going to be a bumpy ride.

All of this has happened before.  All of this will happen again.

It seems booms are about 20x of ATH and pull back is 3x of ATH.  
I anticipate $400k and a pullback to $60k.   Sounds ludicrous from here but in 2017, when the price was just starting to hit $1k, did you think we’d see $20k?

His fiscal advice isn't necessarily *bad*, especially if you're the kind of person who's never had any kind of investing advice and are now wondering why all of your money goes to paying the interest on your credit cards and you have nothing left at the end of the month.  
What I hate about it is he spins it as "listen to me and I'll make you rich, like me" and while his investing advice will certainly keep people in a solid lower middle class lifestyle, it'll never really elevate them beyond it.   I see far too many people like this in my hometown.  They don't understand that buying a house *can be* a great investment but it's far more important to buy the *right* house than *a* house.   They end up like my father who keeps buying nice homes in nice areas but in areas that never appreciate.  Then when my girlfriend's "shithole" house in a "bad area" (that cost the same price) doubles in value over the course of four years he wonders why his only went up 5%.   My father doesn't understand why I bought a Tesla at 110% loan with no money down, but it was because at 1.5% on the loan, it was foolish for me to pull money out of investments.   Plus, with the tax credits and the fact that I picked up a demo unit at a discount and the money I saved on gas and maintenance and insurance over the car I was driving meant that I was projecting to break even when I sold it a year later.  Spoiler alert: I actually ended up far ahead on that car. 
But those are things Dave Ramsey would rake me and my girlfriend over the coals about.

That’s funny, because I will only sell them bitcoin at $30k, not $3k.

I must have been around Bitcoin too long.  This fall doesn’t even seem all that severe or sudden.  This must be the third or fourth time my friends have said Bitcoin is dead and that it’s never coming back.  
Uh huh.   
I’ll be happy to make fun of them when we hit an all time high again.  Might be a year or two but I’ve been there and done that. 
Every day I’m HODLing.

Thank you for the advice.

What are the alt coins worth pursing besides BCH assuming I have a similar amount of BTC as OP?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:38:23
Yes.  No.  Maybe.  
Can you catch a falling knife?

Man, the swings are rough today.  Really rough.  I go from "lost too much" to "ok, that's ok..." 
Fuck.  
I really hate that the market doesn't close, and there's not only irrational exuberance going on right now, but it's impossible to tell if it's that or the lag.  
Double fuck.

The guys who made this game were long time members of the Something Awful forums.   Bitcoin is really seen as a joke over there, and there's a very active thread right now called "the price of bitcoin is crashing hard" and they're all laughing about how much of a joke bitcoin is and how much money people have lost. 
I'm not surprised at all by their response. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:29:29
Perhaps.  But it may be that there isn't a bad time to buy. 
I bought at $200 in April, near the peak.  It crashed hard and I "lost" a lot of money.  So what?  It's way up today, even over the "high price" I paid a few months ago and even the crash yesterday. 
So someone buys at $600 today.  If it's $1800 six months from now, that was a good buy, even if it dipped to $200 in between.

I've been thinking about that since I bought my bitcoins -- which were at a higher price than I could buy them now. 
I think in a few years, we'll be talking about how many satochis someone has, as it will be very difficult for late adopters to buy full coins.  Think of it this way, there are 300 million people in the United States alone.  There are not enough coins for everyone to have one by a factor of ten.

You're right.  The problem is, he has no idea *what* the police were investigating or how he might be tied into it. 
An example that happened to me.  One afternoon, the police knock on the door of my high rise apartment.  Weird, but I go outside in the hall to see what they want.  They immediately treat me like a criminal and asking me a bunch of questions and reading me my rights.  
From my point of view, I have no idea what's going on.  I've done nothing wrong.  It's been a pretty normal day.   I've mostly sat around the house, did a little work from home, and watched a movie.  I'm very tempted to start trying to tell them how I'm not a part of their investigation, but having been read my rights snaps me into sobriety.  I refuse to answer questions without an attorney present and keep asking if I'm detained or free to go (neither, oddly).  I keep reiterating that I don't want to talk and I'd like to just go back inside. 
There are two questions that stand out in my mind.  One, they asked if I'd been drinking.  As a matter of fact, I had had a beer earlier in the afternoon.  They also asked if I'd ever been diagnosed with depression or had suicidal thoughts -- I have, and I think that descriptions fits a lot of people.  
Come to find out, there was a guy in my building who had gone out on his balcony, gotten drunk, thrown empty bottles and people and threatened to jump.  He also happened to have my general body type and the height made it difficult to determine any distinguishing features.  Someone miscounted the floors and the police thought it was me.  Had I mentioned that I'd been drinking and had been depressed in the past, I likely would have been arrested.  Proving I *wasn't* that guy would have been difficult and expensive.  
You never know why they want to know what they know.  An innocent answer or even just a factual one can cement your status as "the guy we've been looking for" in their mind.   Thanks to a nice human phenomenon called [confirmation bias]( shaking that idea once it's established is extremely difficult.

If we hit $10,000/coin, I'll buy a Tesla with it. 
Unfortunately, I'm a late adopter and don't have as many coins as I'd like.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:49:52
This is one of the reasons I think we've still got a ways to go in the market.  I know many people who were trying to buy last week that couldn't because it's a pain if you're American.  Double that if you aren't tech savvy and don't have someone you can trust walk you through it.
