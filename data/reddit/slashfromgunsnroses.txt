I think you conflate everyday speak with what bitfinexed is doing. There is a very big difference between talking and writing "investigative journalism" when it comes to statements of fact. Don't pretend there isn't a difference.
And Carl sagans dragon is much more about the worthlessness of unfalsifiable statements, and what it means in relation to proof of god. Here we know *quite* a deal more. Bitfinex exists. Thethers exist. Bitfinex has an account. Bitfinex has money. Now, are you going to start claiming that we know the amount of money in bitfinex' account?
You should really stop using examples when they dont apply to the situation. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:33:10
And what is your interpretation of that in relation to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:08:51
I might have been too vague, but I see exchanges much more broad than just Kraken and the rest, and pretty much in line with the definition you listed. The way I see it, its common for all of these are that they are also actually possible to regulate. They are end points where a person hands over his crypto for something else.
Fincen doesn't regulate bitcoin as such. They regulate what you can do with your bitcoin, where you can sell it, what you can exchange it for, but not how you transfer it or how the network runs.

First, I'm pretty sure that mining currently is profitable for almost anyone. You might get more btc by buying directly, but mining is still profitable. Anyways, its not so much about it being profitable or not, but if its even possible to mine. If the network is centralized states can dictate concensus rules or censor transactions. If you have to run a $20k node, very few people will do so, and it might not even be possible to mine (you would be under a perpetual 51% attack where the "state" miners wouldn't work on your blocks). Right now we are luckily in the situation that there are so many nodes, and anyone can run a node, and enough mining power is available that the network will work fine without "state" miners.


They are already under state "control". They have to follow certain regulation. This is actually the only place that is possible to regulate bitcoin for the time being. Well, its not so much regulation of bitcoin as it is actually regulation of $ and €.
But if the bitcoin network was also centralized we'd be in deep shit.

All LN transactions are bitcoin transactions. Only difference is they are not broadcast immediately, but they are just as valid as any other transaction in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:40:23
Let me put it in another way. You, as an american can't withdraw or deposit anything from american banks to bitfinex.
I don't even know if they will actually let you sign up, which the US can't stop anyways. Either way, the US has no possible cards to play to enforce the subpoena, except for the bitfinex guys to play nice. Maybe they can pull some strings to make like somewhat annoying for them, but they can't make HK extradite them or anything like that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:56:06

Well, if you have a node thats doing tons of business (lets imagine amazon) then of course it will have lots of channels - but will that make it centralized?

Thats fine, in your case you'd not tell your wife that the house was on fire still. I don't know if you noticed my other posts, but I find the lack of transparency of how tethers are issued disturbing, and Im not trying to defend them, or say theres not a problem, so I have no idea what you point with your post is.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:38:14
The keyword here is *speculate*. You have still have no idea of the amount of usd that tether holds. Do you understand that point? No amount of failed or cancelled audits will reveal what they have in their accounts. It makes the impossible to trust, sure. But your *belief* about what they have in their accounts has no bearing on the actual balances there.
Why is this so hard to understand? Do you understand the difference between belief and proof?

Thats what I thought too. So if this is the real deal, supposedly everytime you send money to finex they print some tethers for you. They might batch them up.

Its like the author doesn't even know of possible solutions to the problems hes talking about...
He got one thing right though. Bitcoins value lies in its decentralization, and thats what we are fighting for.
I don't really care what it will do to the growth of the economy that we get a deflationary currency. The real problem, that he doesn't touch, is why would people adopt bitcoin if 99% of the coins are held by 1% of the people in the world? Its essentially giving hodlers more or less everything. Furthermore a deflationary currency actually acts as a sort of "tax" on future work to be done by other people. Lets say in 2020 we switch to bitcoin and we have 21 million at that point (I know its wrong). This means that all the stuff in the world has a value of 21 million. Next year we work really hard and theres now 21.5 million worth of stuff in the world.. but theres still only 21 million btc. This means that the 0.5 million worth of stuff is actually increasing the value of the 21 million btc thats in circulation, essentially making hodlers richer. Sure thats nice for us... but it makes just as little sense for your money to increase in value, as it does for it to decrease.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:43:45


This is not about semantics, unless you confuse the word "prove" with "believe", and I think its incredibly important to make distinctions between what we do know, and what we hold as opinions. Especially when lots of people read what you write, and especially when theres actually a real possibility that you might be wrong. Bitfinexed writings can best be described as truthiness ( ~~being of the same nature as post truth, although he genuinely believes what he writes (

To be honest, I don't think you should count nodes with single channels. They offer no routing capability and can't really be considered to contribute to the network. I have nothing against them at all, absolutely not, but I don't think it makes sense to count them when they are more akin to "users" than "part of the network". I mean, if they lose the ability to send transactions they don't really have anyone else to blame but themselves.
Its like, if we just imagine a decentralized lightning network, but with a lot of unconnected nodes around it, would we suddenly start to consider the decentralized lightning network to be centralized if they all decide to connect to a random node?

I agree, but the illustration say one of the concerns is that funds are "locked up" in a channel, and presents solutions to this. One of the solutions is to top up your spending channel from cold storage. Now if you want to do this you probably have to have a channel from your cold storage with "locked up" funds, so that might not convince a person who considers it a problem that funds are "locked up".

Worst case scenario is that its possible to connect the dots and figure out what node initiated the original payment, and the corresponding on-chain transaction right?

Lets just call it disagreement. Just think about what you are saying: If I decide to generate a lot of tx, for no other reason than taking up bandwitdth, at maybe 1 sat/b or whatever price I want to, then that would not be considered spam under your definition.
I think its obvious that *intent* of the transactions, and not price, is the main thing to consider when calling a tx spam or not.
Another thing you can consider is *why* the 1 mb limit was set in the first place. What was it supposed to prevent?

Sure we are likely in a bubble. The question though is, how high will we go, and how big will the burst be?
Will we go first to 100k then to 50k? Or was 20k the high and 13k the low? Will we go to 1k?

Im almost certain you can. The option is there. The bitfinex subreddit has people complaining when they cant withdraw, but I expect its only the negative cases there, like for all the other exchanges. A guy posted about his bank refusing the wire from finex at least.
Please try, Im looking for confirmation if it works.

I'd buy more, but my wife doesn't think its the best idea. She thinks its too risky, so thats fair enough. We cashed out enough to cover initial investment, so were home safe.
If the price goes down we'll be fine. If it goes up... well then it will probably continue to do so for many years, eventually letting us retire pretty early for our age :)
In the mean time I've got some bitcoin scraps I'll test out in LN, and try to grow with some leverage at times like these.

Sure, but that metric wouldn't mean anything for anyone except for BoA customers who would just risk getting bad service, or no service. As I see it its their own problem. I mean, if I decided to join the LN I wouldnt care if BoA had 10 or 1000 customers, but I would care if the whole network was possible to block with 3 or 4 nodes for example.
A counterargument could be that if BoAs 1000 customers are all big players like coinbase or wallmart its a different situation. Its a very hard thing to quantify I agree.

When you transfer USDT to finex it becomes "usd" there. Same if you wire them USD. You can send USDT there and withdraw USD appearently. Of course, theres no saying how much USD they actually have, but its a pretty fucking stupid game to play. I mean, instead of being smart and just cooking their books in quiet they invent tether to cook them in public just so they can pay out USD of their own pocket (its supposed to be unbacked right) when you withdraw USD from their exchange.
It baffles my mind that anyone thinks this conspiracy makes any sense.

The point was that "TPTB" would deny acceptance of coins originating from other chains.

Those 30% can open channels to more or less any other node, and they would get better and cheaper routes. Its highly incentivized to open more than one. Bur if these nodes are really just satisfied with just 1 then more power to them. It doesnt make the network any less useful for the rest.
No one is suggesting everyone open chsnnels to everyone else.

Came here to write this. Whatever the regulations say its in the end up to Fincen to start regulating. It doesn't matter if theres a little loophole here or there, or if it really applies or if it really doesnt. They *will* regulate if they see a need to. Either by using existing regulating, or creating some new. They don't care about the words of the regulation in the end, but their *mission* (not talking about some covert mission, I mean their job). If they begin to believe cryptocurrency transfers suddenly should fall under KYC/AML regulation then thats how it will be. But they haven't so far, and they won't care for a second if one of the hundreds of cryptos use some smart crypto trick to speed things up.  Plus, if the regulation they want to implement isn't enforceable, it most likely wont even be considered.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:28:39

@_date: 2018-01-29 23:21:03
Thanks, thats all I asked. Just a note. The only not completely unconvincing theory I can think of is that they are somehow less liable if they cheat through tethers, but I have a very hard time seeing that actually fly in court. For that to make sense they'd have to think they (bitfinex ceo's) were completely unliable because of tethers, but thats even less believeable.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:36:06
You are basically rehashing the text, which does nothing to further the understanding of its meaning or interpretation. As I already said I care little about the text, because if fincen *decides* it needs to regulate this it will either interpret the text as it sees fit, or there will be passed new regulations.
edit: the real question is; do they want to regulate
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:40:55
Are you serious? You wouldn't even know if they were just quietly cooking the books internally right now, and we'd never know until the last $1 billion usd was attempted to be withdrawn from bitfinex (can you even withdraw $ btw?).
With tether everything that happens is out in the open, and people are assuming that its not backed, so "getting away with it for substantially longer" makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:15:05
so theres a max amount of channels a node is allowed to have open or what? And whats the problem if it has "too many" according to you?

thats fine, I always give the benefit of the doubt first though
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:04:28
Not trying to defend anything. Just pointing out that it could actually be working like that, especially when you can also withdraw usd from bitfinex. If you wanted to you can buy tether on kraken, send to finex and withdraw in usd.
I mean, it makes quite a lot of sense to bypass your banking problems like that. Plus you even get to cash some interest rates on the usd.

The only number that matters
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:52:33


What I mean is, in a world where 1% of people hold all the bitcoin and the rest of the world had to decide to adopt bitcoin as a means to put value on their things, they would essentially hand over the world to the bitcoin holders.  From that perspective it doesn't make sense. Of course if you do this much more gradually its different, but its a very real possibility that holders would never sell, until this transition has happened. Thats what they are waiting for. But that will never happen if people just hold, because who would want to hand the world to just 1% of people holding bitcoin? Thats just my point.


Its the transition from money to btc I'm saying wont happen if the distribution is bad.


Why not? If people hold then that just makes the available bitcoin more valuable. If 50% of all the coins are just being held by a few hands who refuse to spend it, the market will just make do with whats available. People just get to split fewer coins between them for their enterprises.


Its a 100% guaranteed return, so thats pretty sweet. 


Not necessarily. This really depends on how big total growth compared to stock market growth would be in a deflationary economy. I really have no clue if it would be the same or different. I see no reason it should remain the same though, and suspect them to be closer to each other than they are now.

As I said somewhere else, that is hardly going to help them in court. Especially when bitfinex itself is responsible for tethers, and also claim they are backed 1:1 
It willbe considered fraud of the highest order in any case.
Or you think a court will just go "oh you used tethers which you claimed were equivalent to dollars for your customers, totally ok guys". Not gonna fly, I guarantee it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:38:41

Not much to do with a lost SSH key. In this case you'd probably have to copy them again from the SD card, shutting down the node.
Coming to think about it, once you've breached SSH theres not much left protecting the bitcoin private keys anyways, so theres no reason to be more paranoid about it.

I with you on  but I'd not be happy if they dont get audited.

@_date: 2018-01-13 08:32:15


First, this has nothing to do with envy or jealousy. Why do you think that? 


yes, this matters of course. But if the tiny group of people holding most of the btc decides to start spending it, all services and goods you can buy will increase in btc price, effectively working as inflation and making your btc worth less.


You wouldn't be prevented from obtaining bitcoin for your product just because a small minority holds a large amount of btc. What would happen is you would just be able to get a lot less btc for your product that if all the btc was liquid in the market, which is my whole point.


sure it relies on economic growth, but stock market value is also tied with this, and much more sensitive. All I'm saying is that its a much less risky (and less rewarding).


Sure, but if ½ of all btc is idle in the hands of a few, these persons will get half the total value of that growth, while the average joe (holding less btc compared to a situation where a few don't hold ½ of all btc) would get a smaller proportion.
You have to keep in mind that my premise is that there are some really big hands, just holding btc, and I'm saying if that is the case, then I have a hard time seeing that btc will be successful in being adopted.

No, thats called logical consistency. Refusing to be audited (source?) does not prove tether is unbacked. Do you understand? It of course cast serious doubt as to whether to trust that they are, but it does not constitute proof that they arent backed. You understand this distinction right?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:28:24

You are asking if a state actor can buy all the blockspace? Sure they can, but how long can they keep that up for? The only thing they will accomplish is making miners rich that way. Bitcoin will still be chugging along.
Now ask yourself that question again, and think what will happen to for example bcash if a state actor attempted the same. Remember, the policy for bcash is just to increase blocksize so its going to be cheap to do this attack, and it can continue for as long as it takes to centralize the network, which is the real concern when were talking cryptocurrency vs states.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:09:18
That could be
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:17:09
But the transaction volume is not necessarily proportional to channel size. A smaller channel can easily have larger tx volume if the funds pass back and forth faster.
With regards to economy of scale, I believe that its so cheap to operate a LN node that it wont make any sense to talk about scale here. Remember, its going to be ordinary people running many of these channels, just using their spare time on the connection they already pay for, at negliable electricity cost.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:50:02
Thats an excellent use case.

Higher liquidity? Like larger channels? Why would that lower fees? Larger channels would be larger targets for hackers to try and steal private keys -&gt; more risk and larger fees.


I haven't seen any detailed posts about the exact behavior, but I don't expect it to just open channels randomly. I most likely bases this on current network topology and channel states (looks for unbalanced channels and tries to open channels that might balance).

Better connectivity, lower fees for you as you can find better cheaper routes. More fees for you if you route.


It automatically opens and closes channels (8? in total?) to build the network. I'm not sure exactly how it selects the best nodes to connect to.

You still misunderstand. The *fact* that your drug cures cancer, or not, is completely unrelated to whether you have been able to prove or disprove it^1. Now, the difference here is that you need to prove it *to be able to market it*. The FDA doesn't ever tell you "your drug doesn't cure cancer". They only ever say something like "you haven't proven your drug cures cancer so you can't market it".
^1 of course its easier to prove it works when it actually works, plus there could be false positives/negatives

The real attack isn't fees. Its centralization of the network. They don't care about fees. They care about control, and you can't control a network where anyone can become a node, and anyone can mine. With larger blocksizes you increase this centralization, and you end up with a network that is much more manageable from the view of a state.

Then you drone on about me not realizing he wasn't talking about keeping bcash (read my comment up ealier in reply to another guy), when its not really relevant to the discussion (about me "attacking bcash"), and certainly can't be interpreted as me attacking bcash.
Can you elaborate on how thats me attacking bcash?

Sure you have to pay on chain. But to make a tx on LN you pay virtually nothing, and you can continually top up your channel, for example by buying from an exchange that supports LN. That way you can actually keep your channel alive for as long as you want to. You make your initial channel as large as you find practical to support your use. Another possibility is to open a channel from your cold storage that you top up your channel with if you prefer that security wise.
If you are not convinced LN can work thats fine, I don't really mind.
@_date: 2019-07-08 09:37:16
im pretty sure most exchanges operating in the eu and ys have to comply with this, but i dont know. point is, all outputs are not created equal because of this. coinjoin and later confidential transactions can alleviate thus problem. but to pretend this problem doesnt exist is like sticking your head in the ground.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:19:08

He often presents his premises, analysis and conclusions as facts, which makes it impossible for me to take anything he writes serious, which is not good, as this is a serious matter.

But your node has the private keys to sign transactions in the channel, so if the private key is with the node it can be accessed by hackers (right?). I know LN is completely secure, but nodes can be hacked like any other thing right?

we are still far from this being easy to use. first we are missing some important parts of the puzzle like eltoo and channel factories. these will be really powerful tools when it comes to channel management that automatic channel management wallets can leverage.
eltoo is a bitcoin protocol change, but all thus channel management is in the end down to wallets implementing it, which we are not very far with so far

Don't forget that most of the nodes are already running. A node operator doesn't have to hire people to take care of servers, code, contracts for bandwith, power, offices and all that stuff. They already have it running so its dirt cheap to start up. They don't have to generate a certain ROI. Maybe LN fees are so cheap its actually only possible for small node operators to do this, while larger companies might just write the operation of a node off as a business expense.
You talk as if you know for certain what it will look like, but there are so many variables at play.


You look at it wrong. You imagine that LN will be coins moving from one place to another, and thats where it stays. For the most part coins will move in circles, and can pass around many times before being pull out of the system (and fed in again).
Really depends on how the network topology is in the end. Don't forget, channels can set negative fees also, to make people "fill" your channel up again.
I'm not saying it definately will be one way or the other, as that in the end depends on how people *actually* use it. But saying it definitely will end up centralized is taking your mouth too full.

You dont need 1000 channels to keep it decentralized. If the network is decentralized you are just as likely to pass payments one way as the other removing the need to close and open channels because they become exhausted.

Well, both inflationary and deflationary money has some good and bad things about it.
If bitcoin ends up as the worlds currency people will spend less and the economy might slow down considerably, plus its also got an absurdity. If all services/items etc has a bitcoin price tag on, and you add more services/goods to the economy, bitcoin holders effectively become richer (bitcoin supply doesn't "cover" it). It actually acts like tax on future work where the wealth ends up with bitcoin holders. Sure, its good for us, but I'm not sure I'd call it a good thing.

No, thats the whole idea of LN. You pass through payments from one hub to the next - this way you pay through channels from A to B to C to D to E to F. So you don't need so many channels to reach everybody on the network. I have no clue of the optimal amount of channels per node, but will be interesting to see how it evolves.  It might be centralized, it might be decentralized, but we won't actually know before its sufficiently large. My guess is we'll see centralization initially (think the autoconnect in eclair for example just connects everyone to the same node, at least on testnet), and later see decentralization as people can actually make btc running their nodes now also.

The network is secure, but your wallet might not be too safe with private keys on your phone. My plan is to run a LN node where I have a large channel with all my funds connected to, and then on my phone have a much smaller channel connected to the same node, so it can be topped up securely.

Dont forget that people who do this have an incentive to do so. So putting just a little effort into running a hub wouldn't be too much. Plus you wouldn't just do *one* channel at a time. You'd do a couple, so if one goes down theres probably another route (unless its in the exact critical millisecs of routing, as far as I know)


Most common hardware can easily have months of uptime without trouble. The most likely problem you will run into is a power outage, but there are ways around that also (laptop, 4G backup connection if you connect through a router that requires power). 


where im from data caps dont really exist. Plus 1 mb blocks is like 10 gb data pr month. Not exactly the end of the world.


Just to put in into perspective. In my apartment in Copenhagen i have
1) never had a power outage (5 years)
2) never noticed internet was down (100 mbit uncapped, 10 $)
3) cheap old laptop I know for a fact has had at least 3 months of continuous uptime
4) 2 btc, which is becoming a quite substantial amount, considering LN will be used for smaller transactions.
Imagine what just a bit more serious LN hub operator could accomplish with regards to availability and LN channel funding.

Thats a wall of text for some very simple arguments that can be refuted with one point:
LN nodes can run on a raspi. Its basically free to a LN hub. People can make money running a hub, which incentivizes that, and competition for low fees as a result.

I was pretty unimpressed by how transactions are actually processed, when I learned about bitcoin first. It was simply too simple. I was like "is that it?". No neat tricks. Just dump all tx into a block and let the nodes run through the whole chain. Inefficient and visionless imo. And its like this for every other crypto.
Except for bitcoin when lightning comes. Thats something that impresses me. If we can't get a network like that up and running, then I don't see crypto ever being a real (billions of tx pr day) payment method.

You don't need much funds to run LN and route payments. How much capital do you think it requires? Show me some numbers.


Banks have, to my knowledge very little btc, so WHY do you mention them? Why would they be running LN? Exchanges and individuals, sure, and dont forget businesses who want close to zero fee, instant payments


We shouldn't rely on people doing this for the good of bitcoin (although a functional LN will increase bitcoins value, so maybe). We should rely on them to collect fees, and open profitable channels. When people are greedy we get competition, when we get competition we get lower fees.

A better practice would probably be to "lock" the tx outputs in question with a softfork that both fixed the bug and implemented this rule.

I think basically just keeping it alive for now, hoping eventually (5+ years) it will no longer be a shit investment. Right now it is, as its basically a burning pile of cash, but eventually as crypto becomes mainstream it might no longer be a liability as it is now.


No, and I don't think thats their intention either. I think they'd just want bcash and btc live alongside each other. In the "beginning" bcash was simply insurance against the UASF [blowing up in everyones face]( Not sure why they kept it alive. Pride? Hashpower "buffer"? Maybe they though it was actually a better scaling solution? I'm not sure. But right now I am absolutely sure they want to keep it alive. They have a million good reasons for that.
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:33:44
The "plan" is idiotic if you think just a little about it: Imagine the meeting in illuminati headquarters when the tech guy breaks the news that anyone can fork the code lol.
"Noooooo, all our hard work intentionally leaving a money trail instead of just paying Adam Back in monero is wasted, we really thought he had control over Bitcoin"
But thats not the most idiotic part, because they hired blockstream who have also spend some time developing coinjoin and later confidential transactions to give vastly more privacy to tx (don't think the illuminati likes that) and developing LN which can give us massive scale... But of course more convoluted explanations can *easily* explain this...
Hell, I'm not even convinced "bilderberg" thinks bitcoin is a threat to them. And I'm not convinced that anything "new world orderly" happens there. But some people really want to believe for some reason. But its fun how these conspiracy theorists are all the same, whether its flat earth, chemtrails, reptilians or bitcoin.

Seriously though, its not looking good for them if its true that their developement teams have left. It might be a huge company with many (non crypto) assets, including miners. But if they don't get money with the IPO they'll be between a rock and a hard place. This might be the motivation for the IPO in the first place? They know they're fucked without a big chunk of money? I can just see that company going south very fast, very suddenly.
Just need one company with a more efficient miner -&gt; much lower bitoin mining revenue and no one buys antminers -&gt; no new income -&gt; no IPO
Normally a company could sell their assets, but in this case they'd be sitting on a stash of shitcoins and millions of worthless miners and no intellectual assets to develop new ones.

They are more a less a startup funded by investors so far. Their business model is, I believe, to be the "Red Hat" of blockchain.
Also, you should look up how many devs blockstream actually have working on bitcoin, compared to the total amount of bitcoin devs. When you read rbtc you get the impression that blockstream simply owns the developement of bitcoin core, when this has no basis in reality.

Its pathetic to pretend you dont know what I mean.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:42:46
I think the reason they didnt just go to litecoin is because they think *bitcoin* is what should change to suit them. But it doesnt work like that because bitcoin is driven by a decentralized concensus, and as they couldnt get concensus to change bitcoin, they skipped the concensus mechanism and want to call their own coin bitcoin.

Maybe I misunderstand these submarine swaps, but when you made your wallet you had no channels right? So does the bcash swap result in a node opening a channel to you?
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:15:13


No they cant. They only know half a txid that they look for, and have an encrypted blob they don't know the contents of. When they see the txid they look for, the tx hold info to decrypt the blob. This is the punishment tx.
Watchtowers can't close peoples channels. They don't even know what they have been looking for if the channels close in a normal fashion.

The concensus rules are the standard. When you create incompatible blocks with the standard you have a fork. Which one is bitcoin? Well, if you dont manage to leave the old chain completely in the dust you simply just have yet another altcoin.

I've been trying to figure out bitmains game for some time. I don't think Wu is motivated by ideology, and is simply in it to make some $. Thats fine, but how does this fit with accumulating bcash? - this is actually not new information, we've known they held these big wallets for quite some time now, and back when I read about it first I got my suspicion confirmed, that bitmain indeed had been supporting the price. It was way too odd that it kept some price parity with bitcoin - there was definitely something desperately keeping bcash from dropping too much. Anyways, I believe them propping up bcash serves some purposes for them: 1) acts as kind of a hashrate buffer for price swings absorbing hashrate - this is also a buffer during halvenings 2) ensuring more than one project can use the SHA256 hashpower, insuring against a btc hash algo change 3) giving at least some use for covert asicboost 4) ensuring that they get to "bet" on both scaling plans
Basically bcash is a nice and handy, although expensive insurance. "Expensive" as in they can keep the bcash on their books and tell investors they have lots of assets. Maybe they would think its fun to prop up the bcash price when delivering their yearly earnings reports to investors, making it look like a healthy company (I don't know much about how this works, just a thought - probably not very legal lol)?
I don't see them killing off bcash, and I don't see them killing off Bitcoin... which reminds me of Jihans tweets about bcash and bitcoin coexisting peacefully.. hmm

The problem right now is that you are limited by the max channel capacity of channels between your node and the recipient. This will be improved by splitting the whole amount in smaller bits and send through many channels.

I'm not so sure, Jihan has made several tweets about bcash/btc coexisting and telling the bcashers to drop trying to sell bcash as the real bitcoin.


Absolutely true, but these are just your run of the mill conspiracy theorists/"experts" who know which is "the real bitcoin". They are not hired by bitmain, or represent their views.
Remember, we're discussing bitmains intentions here, I'm sure lots of people have wanted to plan a "flippening", but I don't think this was bitmains goal at all.

What we need to fix the problem of volatility for merchants is LN on exchanges. They need to be able to instantly dump btc for fiat, if they can't handle the 100% gains and 50% drops (which I honestly can't blame them for).

I think that the moment they decided to do business in their countries they also agreed to play by the rules of said country, including tax laws. Especially when they grow their business in an environmnt that supports a populace with infrastructure, education and a lawful/predictable/stable business environment.

No, as its actually not a statement of fact when I call it bcash. Do you understand that? Its a fact that bcash is being peddled as bitcoin. My response to that is I *choose* to call it bcash. Now, if I was saying bcash's real name was bcash, then I would be factually incorrect, but thats not what I'm saying. I'm just calling it bcash. Thats not a statement of fact, thats a name I use. You can think its idiotic and childish, and thats fine, but you can't call if factually incorrect, because I'm not making a statement about a fact. Do you understand the difference?


What does what I call bcash have to do with anything other than calling it bcash? Me calling it bcash is not proof of anything else than me calling it bcash.


There no mental hoops. Bcash is being peddled as Bitcoin. Bcash is not Bitcoin, thats a fact. The only "mental hoop I have to jump though" is deciding that its fair for me to call bcash bcash when bcash is being peddled as Bitcoin. If you think thats a complicated line of thought to follow I'm not sure it makes much more sense to continue.


Oh brother.


What "unbiased facts" are you looking for really? This is nothing else than me calling it pathetic to come up with bad excuses to make people stop calling bcash bcash. You can disagree with me saying its pathetic, thats fine.

Even of bitcoin was ubiquitous in stores where I live I'd probably still use my credit card. Its just so convinient. Every store had it. Its touchless, and I dont even have to type my pin. Payment *literally* takes 3 sec from the store clerk is ready (generates invoice on terminal) till payment. Fees are negliable too.
And it fraud insured\protected (actually just forgot it at gas station and had it abused, got all my money back).
Sure its not trustless or decentralized, but trust and centralization makes this possible.

To be honest, it shouldn't up to individuals to be generous and donate money around like that, although I still applaud it. The problem is the distribution in the first place. Poor people work too hard without adequate compensation, and rich people make too much, and even get the boons of having capital to reinvest in their own property or stocks etc. I don't have a problem at all with inequality as such, but I don't think perfect equality is something to strive for either. Maybe the problem is the poor peoples jobs are undervalued usually. I can see that with teachers and pedagogues who take care of my kids - and nurses. Their worth is too hard to measure, and thus have no immediate impact, and therefore no one thinks its valuable work.

Great - but then it needs to receive updates from the network with regard to channel states etc to calculate routes right? I know its probably not possible to get a good answer to this (like, what size LN are we talking about), but how much bandwidth will we be using to keep this up to date? Mobile plans and all - thats the reason I asked if Carols LN app leveraged other LN nodes (to calculate route to save bandwidth), maybe a node you run yourself at home, or your friend.

Well, with 18 billion anyone can be dangerous for crypto. Basically they can just keep on buying bcash, and the price will eventually surge due to simple supply/demand, and they can attempt to play games, however I see no signs that bitmain has any plans to sell bcash as "the real bitcoin" and I think they know full well that playing games with bcash/btc will not provide profit in the long term.  What I see is simply a firm that dropped the ball innovation wise, and combined this with playing on the wrong horse (bcash). I think the only thing they can hope to achieve is staying in business and keeping bcash afloat. And thats only possible if they get IPO money. But I don't think thats coming when the outlook is so bad for them.

What I read is that mastercard basically just want you to have a bitcoin backed credit card and where all the payments are done in fiat... Its a silly idea, because why would you want to do that?

I get that nothing has intrinsic value, but if we keep it just a little less philosophical, stuff does actually have value to us (keeping us alive and warm etc).
Its not because I really want to see bitcoin as a ponzi scheme, its just I have a very hard time telling the difference between bitcoin and a ponzi scheme. Im all for bitcoin, and I do have some, and I also have some that I trade with. But there are some big differences between basic commerce and bitcoin. First, bitcoin is not a commodity, its like money that you can use in place of trading commodities, just like normal money, but bitcoin is still one step further away because to use bitcoin you (in 99,9999 % of the time) have to convert it to fiat first. So the only thing keeping bitcoin price up is people believing its going to be worth even more later, and I don't see that at being much different than a ponzi scheme: a guy sells me bitcoin for 2700 usd, I buy, not because I need it, but because I really think I can sell it to the next poor schmuck, or it will be worth more later.
So heres where I'm at. Lets imagine a real ponzi scheme with ponzicoin where theres only ever 1 ponzicoin for the sake of simplicity. I tell a guy its worth 500 usd, and tell him its gonna be worth 2k usd next month (just to get it started). He buys ½ ponzicoin and convinces the next guy two guys its gonna be worth even more (and hey, look at what it was worth when I bought it) and so the ponzi rolls till the very last tier of people on earth.
Now, unlike the ponzicoin, bitcoin has some uses, its secure and can be transferred securely to anyone, at any time. But thats the only difference I can see. It has more use. But the problem is that its not unique, and many other coins exist, so tomorrow we could all decide bitcoin is worthless and instead back ETH. But the reason we don't is because were all invested in bitcoin. And thats why I see it as a ponzi scheme. Its not necessarily a bad thing either, because its about concensus. We all agree that the ponzi coins are the greatest thing since sliced bread, and we should all use it because they are practical, and replace all the fiat currencies with this. But its only possible because we believe in this, and thats very different from fiat currencies, because these are backed by raw power. Bitcoin is backed by agreement that is has value. Just like a contract in a ponzi scheme.
Edit: read up on ponzi schemes. I think I mean bitcoin is more like a pyramid scheme.

In the end thats decided by courts.
The interesting questions we can ask ourselves untill then is about how we can see bitcoin.
First we have to consider btc money.
Then we have to ask if that money is ever in custody of miners/hubs (as ive understood), or if hubs and miners are just considered like network infrastructure. ISPs dont transmit money when banks do their thing over the internet for example. Are hubs just handling signatures and not really bitcoin?
Either way, it makes zero sense to regulate hubs without also regulating users and businesses, as you can just connect to a foreign one.

She can get a bitcoin etf then...
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:00:17


You gave the answer yourself:


Its a simple supply demand mechanic. USDT is currently not possible to transfer out from bitfinex as USD - this means that you want to either trade your crypto to USD or your USDT to USD. If the demand for USD increases (because people want to buy stocks) then the supply on exchanges of USD decreases. If the demand for stocks increase even more, the there will be even less USD available, and crypto falls even further. Normally USDTUSD will be at 1, even in a situation like this, but as bitfinex cant move USDT out right now this supply can't adjust correctly.
I actually think that if demand for crypto rises suddenly we'd see USDT go the other way (this ofc depends on how much people trust USDT also).

Its just as easy to implement regulations for businesses using bitcoin now. They can just require they register, and only allow payments from government approved addresses, so government regulation is not really an argument.
If your hub decides not to process your payment you can just choose another hub that will. Miners already get to choose what transactions they want to mine also.
Edit: my point is that lightning is just as easy to regulate as bitcoin is now. There is nothing special in lightning that makes it any more or less regulateable that transactions on the blockchain. As soon as you deal with a business its easy to regulate. If you deal with an individual you can just select a hub you like, or even create your own, if you think its worth the hassle.

Bitcoin simply wont work if transaction fees are too high, and people will leave fir other coins.

In bitcoin there is only recieving payments or not. There is no special "free speech" bitcoin transfer. As I said, you can just choose another hub that will transfer your money.


Still, your whole argument is something that is not unique to lightning. If government wants to regulate, they can do it now. They can't stop you sending an individual payment through the lightning network. They might be able to stop you from using certain hubs, but then you just find another one. Even if every single hub everywhere in the world is regulated, you can STILL transfer on the blockchain (well, if they managed that mining would also be regulated).


Governments will in any instance of regulation have to regulate businesses to accept payments in a certain way. They can't just resort to regulating a local hub in the country.


It is soooo much different. Anyone can open up a hub and compete in the open market, so there exists no natural monopoly.

Why do you distinguish between censorship and transfers? There are only transfers in bitcoin. If you mean they can block transfers to specific addresses if you use a specific hub, then just pick another one. 


Listen, anyone can open a hub. If the network converges towards one single regulated hub, that blocks or monitors transfers for all kinds of nefarious reasons a new hub will pop up. There is nothing preventing anyone from opening a hub.


Tell businesses they can only accept payments from approved addresses. If its not approved, the payment is sent to the government and you go to jail. Actually, you will need that kind of regulation with lightning in place also. If you just regulate hubs, no one will use them, because they can just use an unregulated one.


People will open and close channels on the block chain still. There are no serious people who suggests the blocksize wont increase to accommodate this.


Actually the more encompassing system is the one with regulation of hubs AND businesses, as opposed to just regulate the businesses. You CANT *just* regulate a hub. Why would people connect to that hub if they can just connect to another one, where the businesses also connect to? You HAVE to enforce this onto businesses too. Lightning or no lightning. And if thats a governments intention, then it doesn't matter if we have lightning or huge blocks.


So what if you cant compete as cost effectively as another hub? If people are bothered by low fees and regulation they will take your higher fees with no regulation. And thats where the big difference lies. Anyone can't just open an ISP and pull the cables to the user. But anyone CAN open a hub!

The ASAP is the problem. You want everyone on the network to upgrade safely first.
And if you want to hardfork, a 2 mb upgrade is just visionless. Get a blocksize cap that increases slowly - plus there also many other things than blocksize to fix in a hard fork.
We could have increased blocksize now, if the project wasnt stalled by obstructing segwit.

@_date: 2017-08-19 12:42:51
Which is a rational move. With segwit and LN we dont completely know how many transactions will be needed on chain, so putting a block size increase of a certain size, at a certain date isnt really smart. Plus theres other things that should be included if a hard fork is necessary anyways.

If they open a mining pool mining 0-conf double spends with 5% hashpower, bcash would need to loose 95% of its hashpower before they'll be able to 51% attack it. That would correspond to bcash going to ~$35-40. Could be realistic depending on peoples reliance on 0-conf working on bcash... which is pretty high.
To put it in perspective 5% bcash mining power corresponds to ~0.5% bitcoin mining power, so its an incredibly cheap attack, that might actually not cost anything as they will be able to sell the mining rewards. Maybe even take advantage by shorting on exchanges.

@_date: 2018-06-12 20:09:22


I might have made a too strong statement as we don't know either way, but its also factually incorrect to state that LN is regulated. Arguments can be made for both, but this doesn't mean I think both are equally likely. 


As I read it, thats about someone *handing* you money and you *hand it on*. In LN you can't actually do anything when routing funds. The only choice you have as a node is to route or not, and in this case its exactly like mining. You either include the tx in the block or you don't, and this is a very important point considering that they didn't really care about the actual technical details of what happens.
And as I've said before, this makes a lot of sense, because why would they suddenly consider it being different from a normal on chain tx (apart from privacy concerns, but thats a whole other and much broader issue).


Sure, they *can*. I've never said they can't. My point is simply the current regulation is by no means clear cut on this matter, especially because there has never existed something like LN before. Its different from just handing of money to the neighbor on your left, its atomic, it happens or it doesnt.
So as its not clear cut you can't argue that LN is regulated. You can argue that it *might* be regulated in the US under these rules. But thats quite a different statement from the broad sweeping "LN is regulated"


I just wan't to be clear: did she reply that "LN is considered MSB?


I don't doubt that they're proficient, but the letter that we regard as the "mining exception" seems to not consider that mining is actually the process that confirms transactions. Not that  They are in effect the transaction processors of bitcoin, and they didn't seem to touch this subject at all in the response. The response seemed to only deal with what happens with the mining rewards.
The only question that I need a good answer for is: why would they suddenly consider it being different from a normal on chain tx? In effect they achieve the exact same thing. Both are systems that send funds from A to B.  No one has the money in between (LN is atomic). No one can change the tx. The only thing a LN node or miner can do (with on chain) is to either mine the tx, or route the payment. These are the things that concern the regulators. They don't care about hashing, HTLCs, tx propagation or LN routing. And as they put so clearly, they don't actually care about the technical process by how this happens.

"300k is only used for the block size limit should the proposal be activated prior to 2017 April. If it is deemed too small, activation can simply be delayed until the desired limit is reached, retaining the current block size/weight limits until that time (or even an additional softfork used to create a temporary limit at the desired level)."

What i read is
1 mb blocks are big enough for now. Increase within some years necessary (*perhaps* decades).
And there is nothing there suggesting he wants to decrease block size either.
Edit: to sum up, you had two claims:
- "no more blocksize increases beyond segwit, within the next decade".
- Luke-jr even wants a blocksize DECREASE.
You even quoted Luke for "But that's several years (decades perhaps) away" disproving the first, and theres no trace of a suggestion to lower blocksize in Lukes post.

however another softfork rule could possibly also be added that slowly pushed down sha256 difficulty somehow

I've argued this point a couple of times before, but the important part here is to understand that regulators don't just regulate or apply regulation because it fits down in some of their boxes. They choose to apply regulation for a reason, and if that reason is not covered by regulation they will either create new regulation or make existing regulation apply.
So the real question is what purpose does regulation (or lack of) of LN nodes serve? I'd wager that it serves the same purpose as regulating (or not) mining. They are either interested in making bitcoin transfers subject to KYC or they're not. If they are, why would they let a wide gaping hole of on chain tx' go on? I mean, if you're going to launder money, and regulators have regulated LN, what do you do? Just send it on chain.
And that's not even touching on the infeasibility of enforcing the regulation.

Sure, its two issue, but so far LN is not regulated until someone rules it is, or some authority declares it to be.


The real answer is "we don't actually know". You are welcome to come up with your own interpretation of the law, and previous ruling etc etc, but it doesn't really matter. The only thing that can shed light on this is an actual statement from an actual authority on the matter. Also, theres some pretty good indicators that they might just view LN nodes and mining nodes in the same regard. This is the reasoning they said that mining was not considered a MSB:


This is a very important note I think. They don't care about what mechanism you obtain your coins, whats important is what you use the currency for and whose benefit. And this makes a lot of sense. Why would they suddenly care that you can *also* transfer bitcoin by means of some clever use of HTLC.
edit: the reply:  doesn't really seem like they've quite understood the full "problem" that worried the miner. It just seems like they think mining is simply creating coins and nothing else. They don't seem to know that mining is part of actually processing transactions on the blockchain.

That chance for successful route based on tx size has not changed is unsurprising. I think currently theres an upper limit for channel size. This, and that LN implementations still need to prove their quality/security might keep people from opening larger channels.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:47:28


Though, is it even possible to partition miners from each other? Aren't they connected by something like  ? I can see how segregating merchants and users nodes could be possible, but in the end you'll need some mining power to generate valid blocks to them, because I doubt the bcash miners will be working on different chains.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:25:01
So, in your opinion, you think they will regulate because they feel that LN gives too much privacy to users? At least thats the best explanation I've been given so far, as people usually just argue that "it fall under existing regulation", which isn't really interesting as the question is "what do they want to accomplish".
While I can see the point that it might be harder to track LN transfers than bitcoin transfers, please remember that we already have coin mixers\*, buy Dash on bisq, and you can do your shady business person to person too, so on-chain tx already have their own money laundering concerns. Also atomic swaps will likely be possible with monero in the future, and bitcoin might even get its own privacy tx through bulletproofs (if I've understood correctly) making matters worse. But I guess thats why you're arguing that were "moving too fast" and regulation might kill bitcoin before it becomes unstoppable?
Anyways, if this is their goal, I don't see them *just* regulating LN nodes. It makes no sense, because if you want to launder money or w/e you can just do it already.
Although I agree that its a valid concern that too much privacy on bitcoin can actually be detrimental as it really catches the interest of regulators. But I don't agree that LN will be regulated simply because "it might fit" with existing regulation as thats not really how regulators operate (they rely on intents, purposes).

Because people with tether didn't pull the money out obviously.


It is possible. Send tether to bitfinex, and make a withdrawal, and no, why should people withdraw? People with tether obviously didn't loose money on coins falling... because they weren't holding those coins, but tether instead. Should be pretty damn obvious - its either exchanges sitting on tether from people getting rekt playing on margin, or people just sitting on stashes of tether waiting for a good buy signal.


Why not? I am with some of mine.
And it still doesn't answer my question: why don't bitfinex CEO's not just add zeroes to their accounts instead of making up tether. Making up tether has all the downsides to just plain old "fractional reserve", and no advantages. Can you tell me an advantage?

You are ignoring the point. This fork was decided behind closed doors. The community was not part of that decision. Bcash has proven to be possible to be controlled like this. The fork had to be backed by a major miner or more to be successful, now who could that be?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:37:30
The SEC doesn't, but I'm pretty sure that if it is deemed as market manipulation its a criminal offense, SEC or not.
Pretty sure thats how it works around the world. If Japan think he is manipulating bitcoin price its up to them to do whatever they have to.

So, you either think its theft or you don't. In the hypothetical situation you move there I will go with the answer that you don't think its theft. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Ive really tried to get some of these people to admit that bcash is not bitcoin, but it seems like they want it to be at the same time they say that bcash is better... this has lead me to conclude that bcash should be called schrodingers coin. It both is, and is not bitcoin at the same time, and you wont know which it is untill you see the tx on one of the blockchains.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:55:34
Not a bad plan actually. Just drum up some support for it - I mean, there has to be people who are angry over how little the community had to do with the  eda fix fork.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:29:16
Granted, we cant see into the future, but what is abundantly clear is that the bt2 fork is contentious, and bitcoin wont just die like that. As such its not just an upgrade where no replay protection would be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:25:55
Ive been very reluctant to belive in any conspiracies surrounding these forks, but I believe this pump was planned so long ago to coincide with the 2x fork, which they hope would turn into a giant clusterfuck (which it might have). Successfully pumping bch during that potential pricedrop was actually a possible plan to suck most mining power out of bitcoin.
The motivation is power over controlling their own blockchain, and thats exactly what bcash is organized to do. A small group calls the shots, the bcash developer is the code monkey and miners activate, giving the illusion of "satoshis vision". Prime example is how the EDA fix is being implemented. Date set to coincide with s2x, the developers implements whatever, miners are cool, and then exchanges will play along because its obvious who owns the blockchain. No one in the community had any say in this at all. Exactly how it was supposed to be.

The end goal is mainstream adoption. This is what people believe it has to achieve, and why people attach any value to it. The difference is not from 300,000 to 2 million - its the difference of 2 million to 170 million, not counting all the other transactions (like cash) that are performed.
If bitcoin cant handle 50 million transactions without becoming VISA then its wortless.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:04:16
Aka a hack to make sure the minority chain doesn't die, which is pretty much the reason for the current bitcoin diff algo - kills off the left over chains in case of hardforks. But cash didn't want to play that game, understandably.


Because lots of blocks were mined with it, and those blocks will always be there. It would be "kosher" again. 


Its you who want to stay true to the whitepaper. Do it, or don't.
And Segwit doesn't even hardfork the network, its that compatible. Either way, I'm not one trying to argue that you should follow the whitepaper. Its more like an initial idea of how bitcoin can function that has to be worked on for decades. I for one am looking forward for a better alternative to generating blocks than mining if that ever is possible.

Is that really your argument? That would mean cinema guests could decide that they shouldnt pay for tickets. Im certainly not arguing that, and its certainly not a requirement for my argument either.
But you seem to start understanding that the important part here is that you choose to go to the cinema. Just as you choose to live on my island. And therefore whatever tax you have to pay on my island, or whatever ticket price you have to pay in the cinema is something that you in the end consented to by going there, and therefore cant label as theft.

This is where you misunderstand. Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash can do the same max amount of transactions per second. The only difference is that one is artificially limited a little more than the other. What we need is scaling, to increase that theoretical max amount of transactions. Increasing blocksize  is only a short term relief unless you have the tech ready for scaling.


I don't have a number, but Ver certainly believes bitcoin cash can become like paypal 2.0, but thats ok. Plus theres nothing about 2 layer solutions on bitcoincash.org. Theres only this:


The vision is clearly that "scaling" is happening on-chain. Another thing is that most of the community over at are very very clearly against anything thats not on chain. Try to make a post about pro-side chains, or lightning and you will be shot to pieces with conspiracy theories of banks and whatnot.

@_date: 2017-11-19 11:40:04
Thats another problem. You don't need more than a couple of miners to support a fork because of this DAA that will adjust very quickly. Fun fact: the original bcash chain is still alive and well because of this.
And lets not act like most of the miners (like Viabtc) aren't under Jihans influence. He does supply them their miners after all.
What matters now is not community support. The only thing that matters is what you can get into the ABC client, and you have to be blind not to realize that only stuff that Jihan and Roger approve will end up there.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:23:22


If its from my example where I turned my island into a democracy, then no, thats not theft.


Im not sure where you are going with that at all...


So if another country taxed you even if you don't live there, is that what you mean? They wouldn't have the right to do that, and its generally not how the world works, so whats the point? (exceptions are the US where expats even have to pay taxes, I believe).
My point still remains, that as long as you have the option to leave the country you can't call it theft. If if you lived in North Korea and was taxed and you couldn't leave I would definitely agree that it would constitute theft.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:44:12
Its seemed pretty clear to me in the release. The change was decided, planned, coded and implemented with miners in the loop bwhind closed doors. Not a single heads up to the community till it was set in motion. Just because there wasnt too many complaints does it make it ok in any way. These guys have the power over the coin as you can see.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:23:00
As I argued, you chose to live in a country that requires you to pay taxes. So yes, you did agree to pay the taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:36
I might be getting that you have a pretty odd concept of theft:
I have some property. You may live on my property if you pay me 5% of your monthly income. We have a deal about this. You know the terms before you move there. If you don't pay we end in court and they tell you to pay me. Then they put you in jail when you refuse. And thats theft according to you right?

So, you know in advance that it will cost you a certain amount of tax money to move to the country. You already know this. Then you chose to move there and you pay the tax. And you call that theft? I think we have very different ideas of what constitutes theft. I simply cant understand this, please help me, because Im very curious.
What if instead of a country it was my island you wanted to move to. Same deal, move there and you pay. Is that theft also?
What if I instead had decided to turn my island into a country and adopt the US constitution, and install a president and all that jazz, and you had to pay tax there?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:12:51
Think of it like this: lets imagine a world where theres only the US the rest is not "claimed". Now we wouldnt say tax in the US would be theft right? Then we add more countries to the world, and suddenly tax would be considered theft in the US, even if the US didnt change any rules. If you want to be a libertarian you cant suddenly start to make others responsible for what choices should be available to you.

That would indeed be great, but that system still cant be secure without the blockchain there to act as a safety net. In reality hubs will go down from time to time, or their software bug up, or they might try cheat you. In those cases the fallback is blockchain to be the judge of the contracts.

II will try again. Please try to understand the point instead of just dismissing it. We can take this one step at the time. You live in country X. Country Y taxes their citizens, and you are aware of this. Now the question is, if you move to country Y, would you call it theft when they tax you?

The cinema example is completely analogous to my island example. You can chose to go to the cinema. You can chose to go to my island. You have to pay the cinema. You have to pay me on my island. You know in advance in both cases that you have to pay. So WHY is it not theft when you pay the cinema, but theft when you pay me?
You did consider my tax on my island theft, right?
Edit: can we at least agree that its not theft if you have voluntarily agreed to pay?
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:52:25
depends. too smal, even with astronomical fees might give less total fees. same with astronomical blocksize just the other way - lots of nearly free tx.
there is an optimum blocksize somewhere in between if you only look at it from a fee perspectiven
the real question though is how much hashrate is enough, not how to we maximize revenue to miners in tx fees.

I dont see it, because for your definitions of theft you end up with some very odd situations that would never be considered theft by most people. Your examples are also completely different in nature than mine. Here the thieves are not on their own property, which is the whole basis for my argument.
My example is no different in nature to going to the cinema, and watch a movie where you dont pay. You know in advance that if you go there you have to pay, but suddenly its the cinema whos the thief?

It never does. Bitcoin is what we want it to be. You either softfork and theres no discussion, as theres only one chain, or you do an uncontentious hardfork in which case the old one dies due to difficulty (not a feature cash has), or theres a contentious hardfork in which case the the original is bitcoin (if it survives). 
Edit, not that I think segwit is contrary to the whitepaper.

initially i was very curious as to what would happen with a fork. i thought it was great that the community split. but *very fast* rbtc devolved into "bcash is the real bitcoin". hilariously you barbara streisaned the shorthand bcash (really, the name is absoluely neutral) by taking offence to it. i was neutral in the beginning (you forked off, thats fine didnt see any attempts to claim "the real bitcoin" or any such nonsense, and the name bcash looked absolutely fine. you aint gonna have me write out the whole name when talking about it, and there was some pretty big confusion as to the ticker bcc/bch. plus bcash is more readable than bch.
but someone had to ve a snowflake and take offence lol
had you guys not supported calling it "the real bitcoin" or spreading misinformation/fud about bitcoin 24/7 you'd be in a *much* sweeter spot today. i kind of laughed when fyookball recently showed this kind of sentiment

Basically every LN transaction is signed by both parties that they agree the balance is some amount. This is called the channels state. Your counterparty can then broadcast an old state of the balance in his favour, but you also have the real (newest state) that you can broadcast which will be the one committed to the blockchain. At least thats my understanding

Sure, its a simplification, but here is one of the things I simply don't see how you can make fit together. Its not theft if I own the island, but if I decide that my island should get a constitution, and voting and so on, and then you decided to move there it would suddenly be theft instead. It doesnt make any sense. And it doesnt make any sense because the point is that you voluntarily go there, knowing full well what is required of you living there.

no. ive never had that make sense either.
another thing to consider is that miners can actually, if they wanted, soft fork in extension blocks with a blocksize increase if they wanted., so its kind of hard to hijack tge bitcoin project. blockstream doesnt decide what goes into Core, and Core doesnt decide what software miners or users run. Hell, anyone can propose soft forks and have miners mine that. Its only when we start to develop the coin by hardforking, because how *exactly* do you decide what goes in and when, and which fork is "the real chain". thats when you get centralization. does that remind you of some other coin?

They know full well that they are losing money. They even moved hash from btc to bcash because of this "hash war".
If they move hash back to btc the sv pools might start to reorg the abc chain. Abc might have the most pow right now, but sv pools seem like they don't care that they loose money - they are backed by billionaire calvin ayre, so the abc pools are kind of forced to mine at a loss.

For all the questions about addresses, batching, number of inputs and outputs, isn't it just as relevant to just look at the amount of data being transmitted? First, if theres not much change in the amount of data being transmitted, its only a question of how that data is utilized, and if blocks are still mostly full thats also a sign that were not really processing less "transactions".

Its possible he might not be completely rational - he wouldn't be the first billionaire on coke :p
Also, its possible he has other motives - bcash shorts are on an all time high, he might really be cashing it in, knowing its going down the drain. Another theory is that crashing bcash would bring bitmain in pretty big trouble (they have 1 FUCKING MILLION BCH!!!), which would be good if you wanted to boost your own mining business...

Your point hovers around your opinion about the legitimacy of the government. Thats fine, but at the end of the day its just that. An opinion. We can discuss its legitimacy, but that doesnt make you statement of fact "taxation is theft" any more true.
The closest you can come is that "in my opinion my government is not legitimate, and therefore I consider taxation theft".
Now, if you want to explore the legitimacy of government, the unfairness of how states can decide law of the land, or if the current distribution of property rights is even legitimate we anc do that. In particular, why do you consider your current possesions legitimate? Did the seller of your land have the legitimacy to sell it? Did the seller before him? Was it bought from the government at some point? Who owned the land in the first place? Natives? Were they rightfully compensated? You see, its not so simple to just claim the government is illegitimate, because most surely the argument for that can be used to show that currently even your own possesions are most likely illegitimate.

These are problems that must be fixed before we can use bitcoin for most normal tx. Its works fine as payment for small everyday purchases like coffee (at least with LN), groceries, gas. Stuff you use and dont expect to return, or not have delivered. Also contract basef purchases like houses, or deals between companies and that kind.
But semi valuable purchases in stores and especially on the internet you really want a middleman.
Untill bitcoin can deliver on all fronts it will have a hard time replacing the current system IMO.

1) its not so much about buying beers in a bar - its much more important when it comes to buying stuff online (mobilepay is supported many places) or what happens in case of abuse of your phone (hacking/stealing).
2) sure you can, but thats not happening on bitcoin at the moment
3) Mobilepay is actually free to pay with. Mobilepay is a system operated by danish banks, and I guess they just write off the expense onto their banking customers. Sure, in the future if bitcoin becomes large competition will happen, but if the difference between using bitcoin and money will just be 0,1% or whatever then I don't think that will be the main selling point people are interested in.
4) Its a system operated by the banks, so if that happens mobilepay going down is probably the least of my concerns. You actually see the transfers directly in your bank statements, as mobilepay works through your credit card - both for recieving and paying.
As much as I love bitcoin, it can never be as userfriendly. It will have other selling points, sure, but its going to have a really hard time competing with daily payments. At least in Denmark where I think payments already are fantastic. Dankort (credit card) is taken everywhere - touchless and no typing pin (for less than 200-400 dkr), fees are very low compared to what I see from you US guys. Cash is almost non-existent. I just think its important to be aware what we are up against when looking at already established systems.

They only make money on transactions you actually have them do for you. They dont make money because you pay a fee to VISA for using their payment system. They make money because they can charge you for your credit (ie loans). Sure, they might have some tiny income from transfers, but bitcoin will have no impact on banking because of cheap transfers. What *does* impact them is that its not possible to loam out actual bitcoins, which will really hurt their business, as they make unbelievable amounts of money from loans.
For bitcoin, the blockchain and concensus rules are in opposition to banking. Bitcoin payments are only a competitor to for example VISA. Banks dont really care about payments as this isnt their business.
Edit: maybe I underestimate how much they make on credit card payments, but my point still stands, they dont fear bitcoin because of payments, but because of their actual business of making loans

@_date: 2018-02-09 23:15:32
Let me put it in another way: regulators care about what happens inside the exchanges, and what users send and receive money there. Now, you might argue that it makes it impossible to track on the blockchain, and they want that info also, but 1. they don't know who is behind the addresses already, 2. people can use for example monero if they want to hide the trail anyways.
*If* they begin to feel the need to regulate to achieve transparent transaction on-chain they will have to implement *new* regulation, which might be totally plausible, but the current form of the regulation makes it a waste of time for regulators to try to apply the *current* regulation to a corner of the crypto world that is LN. They would achieve nothing just by this. They need new regulation if they wan't to achieve their goals.

Im not quite sure either, it was just implied that exchanges would somehow lose money, meaning they must have spent real usd to buy tether.
But if people are using real usd to buy tether that means it cant be completely unbacked. Ofc the company behind tether could just run off with the money, but my guess is big players buying tether have contracts that they can redeem for money. Can tether even leave exchanges?
Either way, i just view usdt as an altcoin. It is just an altcoin. What would happen to crypto if a similar sized altcoin was suddenly worthless?

The how-to video takes one click to start
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:53:27


Exactly. The laws are not built for this. So if we are going to speculate on what will happen we really need to keep this in mind, because thats what the regulators do. But we can be certain that the regulation they have in place already has a purpose that they would like to see working on crypto also. So whenever we think about this we really need to think about what they want to achieve, and how they possibly can achieve it.
This is why it doesn't make any sense to interpret the regulation so fx. coinbase can't run a LN node that routes payments, because first, stopping this routing achieves nothing in regard to combat money laundering and second, even if it would help, just a tiny bit, the network is impossible to stop, so they would achieve nothing anyways.
What does make sense, and what is possible, is KYC/AML for exchanges, which is what we see. In my opinion the regulators view sending money off exchanges as a black box, because they have absolutely no idea who is behind those addresses. I believe they see the networks themselves, and whatever happens on them as something they can't control - like withdrawing cash from the bank.
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:11:10
To banks, bitcoin is just another type of asset... They don't care if people suddenly start to trade a new asset between them...
Payments aren't really what banks are making their money from anyways.
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:24:12


Yeah, that could help some. Its easy to check, and can be decided completely by the nodes themselves, what they want to accept. Just need a generic way to handle this in the protocol. Just have your node define some code the attacker must run to solve some problem with a certain difficulty. The difficulty (and adjustment) could be set according to whatever the node deems necessary based on number of incoming connections.

People dont care about most "valueable coin". Its like saying people want the £ because it has the highest value. Besides, the value of bitcoin is right now only driven by the belief that it will indeed replace all money, which is a very fleeting property.
Anyways, I think its easier to understand what I mean by imagining a hypothetical situation where people have to switch to crypto suddenly. People have to make a decision of what crypto they should use. Will they chose a ledger where most of the money belongs to a few people, or would that rather decide to "reboot" the bitcoin ledger and start with a completely fresh one (small mods like PoW that is accessible to everyone, initial inflation rate not too high stuff like that to make it usable).
The question is, what coin would you imagine people would choose? The "pre distributed" ledger, or a fresh one?

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:28:33


sure, but that doesn't mean people will just switch to bitcoin.


But people are the world. If they think that the distribution of bitcoin is unfair, they can just adopt a hypothetical more fairly distributed coin. The point is, why would the 99.99 % of people start to use a currency that 0.01% of the people have full control over (in effect handing them all the worlds wealth)? Even if bitcoin becomes ubiquitous the payment mechanisms will most likely support any altcoin. Lets imagine I could get paid in any coin of my choosing, why would I pick bitcoin (dont forget were at a stage where theres only crypto left as currency so increasing dollar value of bitcoin wouldn't mean anything).
My point is just that the more "unfairly" a coin is distributed, the less appeal it will have to the rest of the people which will result in less market cap of that coin.
I don't have a good solution to distributing coins, but at some point or other this will become a problem for bitcoin.

They don't care for one second about that. Think of monero or zcash - there might be a blockchain record there of something, but its useless when considering kyc/aml laws, but there hasn't been any regulation.

Define property rights. You decided to live in some country. You decided that whatever definition of property rights they use is acceptable to you (after all, you decided to live there).


This is where your chain jumps off - you can indeed stop such payments. Leave that country. No one forced you to live there.
The rest of that is purely opinion. What gives a state right to the land? Does the owner need to produce some document? Says who? You? Your own personal opinion of what you would accept as legitimate?


Technically they are. The french state gets to decide laws within the borders of france. For all intents and purposes they are the landlord there, and people get to rent a little piece of land. Now, you might be of the opinion that its unfair they got all the nice land, but thats a different discussion. For shits and giggles lets play this game, and you tell me when we reach the level of theft:
1) I own a piece of land. **You want to move there** even though the terms are you have to pay a certain price. Theft?
2) Same as above, except my land is now governed by some people I have decided. Theft?
3) As above, except they are elected by the people living there. Theft?
4) As above, except your parents decided to have you as their child there. Theft?
5) As above, but now you are 18, and your parent are no longer your legal guardians. Theft?
Its fine to think its unfair that these countries somehow got all the nice land around, but that doesn't make it theft when its *your decision to live there*.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:29:14
Its not really about what I think is fair or not. The question is, why would the rest of the population adapt a coin controlled by a tiny fraction of people. Its essentially handing them the whole worlds value, so it makes no sense for them to do that.

Please reconsider your (current?) support. The hardfork doesnt have enough support, and will instead damage both bitcoin and 2xbitcoin, and its not really necessary just yet. Segwit is slow but steadily increasing the amount of transactions, and a hardfork isnt going to help more than the damage it will cause (yet another bitcoin, uncounted pieces of software deployed in businesses, users, exchanges - damage the image of bitcoin for non-crypto people).

Alright, so exchanges are paying real money for tether, that means exchanges know that the 20m tether they just bought are backed by the 20m $ they just paid to the tether company.
There are some things to consider - do exchanges have contracts that makes the 20m tether they bought redeemable? Can tether even leave exchanges? How sure are *they* tether is backed by usd.
Who loses in the end if the shit comes crashing down? Thats only the people holding tether. If tether/usd exchange rate goes towards zero then the btc/usdt rate will go to the moon.

If you ever feel nervous, spend a tiny dollar amount extra, and short btc. That way you get more btc in dips. If it goes up, well you lost your tiny amount of dollars, but hey. Your btc is up 25% ;)
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:02:00
In that equation you forget that quite a large amount of bitcoin will be hodl'd by a small percentage of the population (they also believe it will be worth more), which means the rest of the population will have to be fighting over the portion of btc thats liquid. 50% of btc is just being hoarded, and the last 50% is whats actually available for purchase, that means the market cap of bitcoin will actually end up being twice that of all money. This in turn means that peoples bitcoins will actually only have half the purchasing power (if the remaining 50% were to liquidate their btc).


heres the funny part, it actually will. Not compared to for example $ (because we did away with cash right?), but compared to what you can actually buy, and heres why: when people have spent all their assets buying into bitcoin, but the 99.99% only own 50% of the bitcoin, its for all intents and purposes actually the same as inflation when the 0.01% starts to spend their bitcoin! Imagine the economy in equilibrium with its 11.5 million btc being passed around for goods and so on, and suddenly a guy comes in with another 11.5 million btc. Then you got 23 million btc and the same amount of goods. You can probably figure out whats its going to do with the relative value of your btc.

sounds like you have to trust nodes to do the work, and not cheat
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:39:30
Of course there will be need for higher on-chain capacity in the future, but simply increasing the blocksize is not scaling - scaling has to make each byte count for more.
What you are hoping for is that the market will simply just figure out what the blocksize should be. In essence what you are advocating is no blocksize at all, and just let the market figure it out right?
The problem is, the market is not always good at figuring out solutions. Its good a figuring out prices for something you want to sell me, but its incredibly bad at taking into account the cost, to others, of our exchange - especially if that cost is not apparent till a later time (just look at global warming for instance).
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that even if the market could price it right it would result in a network that has the properties that actually make bitcoin valuable.


This is probably a good example of why we shouldn't even trust the market to do what its best for itself - segwit transactions *are* without question cheaper than normal ones. You get almost 50% discount no matter what. So if people can't even figure out that this is a good deal, then I have zero hopes that they can figure anything even slightly more complicated out. But they are slowly adopting it now (coinbase, bitfinex).

Thought so - I mean its only 3 times bigger than the btc chain. If we cant even sync that were fucked already. But what "worries" (I don't hold eth) is I just looked a some graphs of the blocksize growth - it looks pretty exponential to me, and that will give bandwidth problems at some point.

I used to laugh at american movies and politicians villifying russians after the cold war. Thought it was idiotic calling them commies and keeping up the cold war shit.
Then they invaded Georgia and annexed Krim, support civil war in Ukraine, and generally fucking with the rest of the world in an attempt to stay relevant and have russins forget about their local problems, and I changed my mind about them.
They had a good 20 year "neutral" run in my mind.

Sure, its separate, never said anything else. Just dont understand why you would love a guy whos hiked the price for the medicine like that. Greed at the cost of patients health like that is in my world complete inexcuseable, I even think it should be criminal in some cases.
I have no clue what picture the (your) media has painted of him the only thing I know is that hes increased the price. And dont try to lump it in with other, quite normal, price increases, because this is on a totally different scale.
And even if other companies would do similar crazy price hikes, so what? I dont think thats alright either. Its fine to raise price... just not 5000% or whatever it amounts to.

You dont have to deal with exchanges, and for many people this is more secure as they might not have the skills to keep real coins safe.

You dont really get it. Just because he could get away with increasing the price, and others do the same, or me being able to start my own company doesnt make it one bit more ok.

@_date: 2017-09-19 13:40:47
The value of the hardfork chain will be clear before the fork even happens, because futures will be traded. The value will be decided on the exchanges by traders before there is even a problem with transaction on a potential low hashrate bitcoin.
The real question is therefore, what do traders think will give bitcoin most future value: stability or hardforks whenever miners like it?

Im not exactly sure how LN nodes make sure how routing is done, so all tx happen at once, or not at all, but there might be something in that system that can be used as proof that the movement in you channel was done as part of routing

At first I thought up because people are selling stocks, and where might they put their money, then I think I've arrived at the conclusion that people would most likely liquidate their btc and either hold cash, or be smart and buy people panic selling their stocks.
Personally I'd probably go crazy and buy some leveraged index funds when they have lost ~80% of their value :)

@_date: 2018-02-25 13:22:24
As long as transactions are this heavily subsidized by the blockreward thats really going to skew the actual price of a transaction, so thats not a good solution, at least till now, and I'm not convinced its the right choice either later - the price of a tx you pay now carries a lot of unrealized expenses down the road that others must pay for also.

I dont quite agree with this. Deflation can actually work as "tax" in new productivity. Just an extreme example to convey what I mean. I own all bitcoin except for one. The rest of the world entire economy is trading in that single bitcoin. Now, all new value added to the economy actually grows *my* wealth. This is cool if you got the bitcoin, but ideally every new bitcoin worth of production should get a corresponding bitcoin added to the total amount of bitcoins. This is in part what our current system attempts.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:48:15
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:57:56
Came here to say this after reading the article... which doesn't really have that much information.
The "threat" they see is that it can make it hard for them to track customers funds which is required of them. My guess is they added this to their SEC filing because they want clarity on how to handle this.

This practice is NOT how development of new drugs are funded (in 99% of the time appearently). If he wanted to raise money for development he should go to investors, not hold patients as ransom. They essentially got to fund that investment, without getting any of the potential returns. What an asshole. I mean, I know its legal, but that doesnt make it alright.
What im getting at is that medicine prices in the US is generally higher because practices like shkrelis are possible in that system. To argue that the increase in a price is not offset to the consumers in the end is idiotic.

That doesn't mean that people will adapt bitcoin instead though. Why would they not choose a more fairly distributed coin instead? I mean, if we once stand in a world where crypto rules, why would anyone use bitcoin if all bitcoins are in the hands of 0.01% of the people? Would you?

I simply dont believe routing will be an issue regulation wise. It makes zero sense. The purpose of kyc/aml is to regulate dollar transactions.

@_date: 2017-10-07 16:45:11
I dont think core cares. They wont let themselves be forced to hard fork. Theyd rather leave the space than that.
With tx fee, I mean that in the case that bitcoin is the lowest priced and with lowest hashpower, I think that core would rather expect the market to dix the problem. Transaction fees will skyrocket and that will attract miners.
With the recession, that will be the case if there is not a 100% clear winner, as that will be confusing and people will lose confidence in crypto (will there be hardforks every week?).

If its anything like with bcash, they will wait 3 months and see. Holding the cert at hardfork date will yield the holder the forked coins. Buying in after that wont.

Agree that we cant talk about core as one thing, but im pretty sure the client wont hardfork. Some devs might start another branch though.
The math is easy. Fees would have to make up for whatever difference there is in blockreward, which depends on price. Could easily be 50 btc or more, so only whales move money.
Purely hypothetical, not that I see bt2 having a chance.

All you need to know is that signatures are still part of transaction with segwit. This you can verify in the source code itself, or by inspecting blocks.
When you have confirned this, read the bitcoin.com article again and you will realize someone is straight up lying to your face.
Edit: take a look at this recent transaction
The signatures are located under scripts, as always. You can also look up a pre segwit block and compare.

When I convinced my wife to buy bitcoin, she said she didn't want to loose more than 25%, so I DCA'd. Grand average of ~4k after we went from 5k to 3k (also got some at 3k hehe). Told he she was at close at around minus 26-27%, and asked if she wanted to sell (she didn't want to lose more than 25%), but she was pretty calm and told me to hodl!
Ofc she asked me why I didn't just buy all at 3k... she's not complaining though ;)
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:51:00
Strictly speaking, its correct that the futures price does not represent the price IF segwit2x has gone through.
How big a chance that has of happening is close to 0 though, and the way the futures are made is the closest you can get to the real thing.
But its clear they dont even believe in their own project. Blaming "unfair" futures is indeed bs.

Think its deliberate?
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:43:41
I'll try to answer the questions short, it might not be precise, but will probably do :)


The same. The computational requirements are very very low for this. I remember one of the first days after segwit activation, some people demonstrated LN over twitter, by tweeting some signatures and stuff to each other, just to give you an idea of how much a transfer would require. Can't remember where I saw it though. 


We dont have to trust what goes on there - in the end the amounts are settled on-chain. From our perspective there will only be one "transfer". There won't be any less or more bitcoin.


How do you know the counterparty has that many btc? How do you know you have any btc? Thats stored in the blockchain, so we have to touch that at some point.


I'm not too technical, but its actually not the blockchain that handles the individual small transfers. It only records the final balance for each address. Some smart cryptography allows for both parties to agree that they indeed have paid so and so much to each other totally.


I don't see why not. Bitcoin works the same as always, now its just also possible to trustlessly do transfers with an individual party, without telling anyone anything but the final amounts. Its not too different from putting your btc in an exchange, trade, and settle on the blockchain (except no trust is needed in LN).


Channels are two way, so look at it this way: currently your main bank account get pay from your employer, but you also have some expenses. In the case where expenses = income the channel can be open indefinitely. If income &gt; expenses you "save up" and the channel will be full at some point. This could be fixed by having a "savings" wallet, where a channel could be open from your savings to your income/expense wallet, and then you can transfer the surplus to the savings. If your savings are 10 times the surplus pr month, you can transfer 10 times to your savings for example, before you re-open the channel. Just picture this in a much larger setting if you're a firm. Your expenses are employees, but you also have income etc.
Initially you'd probably only open channels to shops you frequent often for coffee.


Difference is that now this spam would actually impact blocksize, and miners would basically be able to control it.


Heres the thing: blocksize must never make running a node anything else than trivial. The power of bitcoin is that anyone can be completely confident in the validity of the transfers, and that they can be so trustlessly. Imagine if it cost 20k to run a node because of blocksize. Suddenly, if you own a small store, you'd have to spend 20k on your node, or trust some 3rd party to verify your transactions. Its a very fine balance to make blocks the right size, so you get enough on-chain throughput, but not so much that its an economic burden to run a node.

They arent the ones making the change that results in a hardfork, and you would have to implement the patch on all currently running software.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:21:36
I might be mistaken about that
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:41:06
Absolutely. People often forget the positive aspects of cc's.
For example, you'll never see me paying for a laptop over the internet with bitcoin, unless I absolutely trust the merchant to actually send it also. And then, why use a trustless currency for this? Whats the point? We do need middlemen to handle this need for trust.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:04:38
And many other companies dont...
What is going to happen is exchanges will take the conservative stance, as they carry a lot of risk in the form if lawsuits if funds are lost. When they keep bitcoin as bitcoin (maybe not even listing 2x) and the price will remain the same, then bitpay will essentially be handling payment in an altcoin, and not bitcoin. Now, the question is if merchants are satisfied with being paid in something thats not bitcoin any longer.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:55:53
I just have one question. How would exchanges handle withdrawal of bt2? Couldnt I just replay the bt2 transaction on bitcoin network, and get some bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:38:35
No, people also have to bear the risk of 2x not happening (same as 0$).

1. Bs increases are the least effective way of scaling, there are still many efficiency improvements that should be implemented first (schorr signatures fx)
2. We just got a bs increase with segwit, and should evaluate impact before more bs increases
3. The timeline for 2x is crazy.

Crypto is still only being owned and used by a fraction of a percent of the people, so this problem is yet to surface. Im saying this will be a problem when hyperbitcounization is supposed to happen. I dont believe it will happen because of my earlier point.
I own bitcoin, because people still believe it will have higher value tomorrow and more people want in.
Edit: in other words, right now were buying into something that will make us own a disproportional size of the worlds future value. When the rest of the worlds population realize crypto is the future, will they then exchange their dollars for something that essentially will make them relatively poorer? Like if I had 0.001% of all money in the world, would I exchange that for 0.0001% of all bitcoin?

Another metric: how many available routes? If it takes 4 routes for 0.01 btc thats not very reliable if there are only 5 possible routes - although it might be very hard to calculate a meaningfull measure of "possible" as as there could be thousands of redundant routes. Maybe take into account only the "outer shell" of nodes for each start and end nodes, not using the same nodes on each route (unless they have large channelse) etc...

@_date: 2018-07-20 11:21:43
Thats an arbitrary and useless definition you have made up. Where do you have that definition from? What is the purpose of that definition? Why is it important that the tx is broadcast? The problem with that definition is that there is no guatantee that the 0-conf tx confirms.
Just fyi, satoshi suggested payment channels many years ago. You think he did not consider those payments bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:35:56
I am very worried about this also. I am going to sell maybe 50% of my holding prior to the fork, and rebuy when its safe. That way I will have covered most of my initial investment.

If the definition of a bitcoin tx is that it *must* be recorded and confirmed on the blockchain, absolutely. But I dont subscribe to that definition. This is the problem bcashers have when claiming LN is not bitcoin tx. Then they have to accept 0-conf isnt also, which was my initial point.
I consider any *valid* bitcoin tx, a bitcoin tx. Unconfirmed or not.


This is a useless distinction. And bitcoin tx on LN carry *much* stronger guarantees than 0-conf, ~~and in some cases as strong guarantee as the number of confirmations the channel has on the blockchain.~~

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:07:41
The effect I'm talking about is not due to deflation actually. Lets just say its a static amount of btc in the economy for the sake of argument. Now, if the economy grows, say 10%, and you hold 99% of the coins, your coins can now buy 10% more. This basically means you become richer (you can buy more stuff the for same amount if btc) just by holding on to your btc. The picture in the current system would be that alongside the 10% growth could be accompanied by an equal 10% of the circulating supply of money (distributed via loans to investments etc) to the participants in the market ie. not to you sitting on the sideline with a bunch of cash not participating.

I know you probably cant give a good answer, but isnt the current fees way too high compared to the incentives the miners need?
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:59:12
Short answer: LN transactions and hubs will be so cheap that centralization is a non issue.
With regard to dynamic blocksize its not too easy to find a good way to determine how it should change. What if a malicious miner just mines half full blocks? Should it be an average? Couldnt miners just spam cheap transaction and mine their own blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:47:27

Apart from the other replies I'd like to add he has argued that bitcoin fees kills babies (because economic freedom). Thats fucking despicable.

If we start coding it before the real increase in demand hits its too late.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:28:18
I am confused also. What I think people have been expecting, was that bcash price would be subsidized by its proponents, which is quite likely. The bch/btc sure had been quite steady an linear down the last couple of weeks. Take a look at other cryptos. They fluctuate wildly.
If no one had been supporting bcash monetarily price would have been much much lower.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:21:44

@_date: 2018-07-17 17:20:44
When you dig into their argument its because LN tx are not yet confirmed on the blockchain. But they refuse to hold 0-conf to the same standard. Intellectual dishonesty at its worst lol
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:34:40
You really dont have a clue how any of this works do you?
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:23:07
If you consolidate some outputs in a segwit address now when fees are low you might save on fees later also.
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:31:34
I can highly recommend bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:57:54
Your definition is that its only bitcoin when the tx is actually in the blockchain.


0-conf is not in the blockchain. So according to your definition that is not bitcoin. Correct?
Because that is exactly what my initial post states. If you agree with this, perfect, at least you're consistant with your argument, but you wont see many bcashers accepting that 0-conf is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:37:55
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:03:58
I think the 2x agreement will be in such a disarray before the fork, that it will be a non event. Just let bt2 futures drop to nothing, and watch more miners and businesses drop out. Wont be long till is completely clear for all that 2x is a non event and confidence is restored and we push for 10k.
My advice: hodl ;)

I think the only thing they will come up with is regulation of exchanges. Both for customers and what is allowed to happen on exchanges (maybe some rules from regular exchanges). This I believe is good.
They might also come up with a common stance on how bitcoin will be handled tax wise.
This is more or less the only things they have the power to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-07 09:17:10


Yeah, thats basically the question, but I agree, its nearly impossible to make a relevant figure off. If you were to, maybe the best approach would be to work backwards, with a very strict definition of "possible route" and loosen the definition till we reach something that looks usefull?

Its not as much a wish as it is stating the obvious facts. In a world with laws and governments, selling stuff that is not bitcoin, as bitcoin will get you sued. No matter how much of a free market anachist you consider yourself, there are still laws that are going to be upheld in the different countries.
Its more a game of trying to predict what will happen. And yes, coinbase will get sued if they try to sell 2x coins as bitcoin, if the rest of the exchanges and community sells 1x as bitcoin.
Its not really anything to do with bitcoin.

Yes. You can short on Kraken. Did a small test, since I couldnt believe it. Too good to be true, but there it is. Only 2x leverage though. You could probably also game the fact that 1 is the mean and it drops and rises over mean once in a while...
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:05:37
I think its so important to find some good metrics for  LN. It will be needed to identify what kind of behavior is needed when opening channels so you have the highest probability of making successful payments. Great work.
Another metric is decentralization - first we need to settle on what properties we think are important (as in why do we need decentralization) and then finding a good metric for that.
Could you also make this graph simulating atomic multi path payments?

Communism, in its end form, has eradicated state-run banking also (no need for money), so I don't see how bitcoin will be negative in a communist setting.

Thats so vague. Also it doesn't say it should be in the blockchain. The "chain" here refers to being able to trace back the coins to their origin through signatures (which also leaves the question: what about the [blockreward]( The blockchain is nothing to do with "chain of digital signatures", except that the blockchain is used to order the tx in which it sees the tx.

@_date: 2018-04-17 20:37:39


Setting aside discussion of what breaking 0-conf would do if bitcoin relied on it for all day to day purchases, the double spend miner is not at a disadvantage here - he still gets to choose among all the other tx that the other miners can see, but he also has a couple extra tx that only he can see, and these double spend tx carry higher fee than the "real" tx. Isolated (disregarding impact on bitcoin prices), regardless of hashpower he only stands to gain.
Now, taking impact on price into account the miner has to consider two things: Will I break bitcoin doing this (-&gt; short the hell out of it) or will things go on as usual (-&gt; just mine double spends). Depending on hashpower one of these scenarios will happen.
Maybe it will be advantageous for the miner, or maybe not, its hard to tell exactly.
But thats actually not the real worry.  What should worry you is the actors who might not necessarily do this for economic gain. Relying on 0-conf turns the normal 51% attack into a much more surmountable problem, as you can end trust and usage of bitcoin by possessing a fraction of that hash rate. Would you accept bitcoin if a customer could doublespend it 1% of the time? How about 3%? or 5%?
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:36:14
As I said:


When I say scale, I mean getting the maximum use out of each mb before we increase. This way we don't needlessly risk decentralization, while making room for more tx throughput by the efficiency gains.
And generally I think playing politics and trading favors and compromises here and there is something we should keep out of bitcoin. Otherwise developers end up being politicians instead of making engineering decisions. Of course, some people think its a question of marketing and fast adoption to "win", while the truth is bitcoin is an unstoppable juggernaut that we shouldn't jeopardize by giving it rollerskates to get there fasters.

No. Its not quite clear to me. The chain of electronic signatures is one thing, and the blockchain is another thing. Satoshi suggested both 0-conf and payments channels.

I think you misunderstand, the reason many of these alts have any value at all, is because they are purely speculative. People buy them because once in a while they get pumped like crazy. This is also the case for bitcoin, but bitcoin is the market maker, and moves all coins in the same direction, and its much harder to do a pump and dump on than any of the altcoins. And the "pumpability" of a coin actually increases its value. Unfortunately the values of cryptos right now is, I'n my opinion driven 99% by speculation, and people hoping they'll make a quick buck. This is less true for bitcoin though.

2. Bitcoin isnt "supposed to" anything. Bitcoin is what *we make it*. If Bitcoin was supposed to be a certain way Satoshi should have stayed, but he left it to the community to develop.
3. Lots of other fake bitcoins increased blocksize, are they bitcoin now?
4. Who says Bitcoin wont see a future blocksize increase?

But you still gotta trust them, and in the future, if these nodes are data centers you can bet you either pay with your privacy or your money for this service. Right now its working fine because people can run their own nodes pretty effortlessly, but what bcash people forget is that when you start churning out gigabyte blocks there will be no nice guys running nodes for the fun of it.
This gives a pretty good idea of one of the problems with just increasing blocksize: 


You wouldn't target the merchant for the double spend. You'd attempt to send that to a miner, and you'd attempt to get the merchant only to see the double spend. Keep in mind, this is a game of chance when your tx propagates through the network. You can increase your chances, or decrease 0conf risk by certain actions, but in the end its insecure.


Why would they? Bcash isn't a threat to bitcoin, although the delusional people in rbtc would have you believe so. And Slush seems like a pretty nice guy, so doubt he'd be interested even. Hell, it might not even be legal to do it.


It is exactly that easy. Open a mining pool, publish your node with a little info about not relaying tx's, and there you have it. Its a wide open gaping security hole.


I don't know how it works there, but that doesnt matter here.


This proposition is the absolutely worst idea that has ever been touted in rbtc and shows a complete lack of understanding of why the system works, and what it means to be "censorship resistant".

One will always be mined sooner or later. Just check  for example. There is no such thing as rejecting a tx really. A tx will remain valid for as long as its input has not been spent.


Doesn't matter. Miners could mine the lower fee, or the higher fee. There are no guarantees of anything with 0-conf. These are only transactions that are lingering around in a nodes mempool, and any node operator can have whatever mempool policy they want.


Your wallet is probably not configured to allow you to double spend, but anyone can write a script, or craft the tx's manually.


When you make a double spend you spend the same outputs more than once. Normally a tx will have an input, and two outputs - one to pay the recipient, the other output will land in your pocket again (change address). When the inputs are spent there is no way back - doesn't matter if you have sufficient balance. It doesn't work like a bank account with one balance. Its a mish mash of different payments you have gotten earlier, and its only one of these payments that you send to the merchant for example. So the merchant won't ever get paid by the rest of your wallet balance. Makes sense?

For gods sake. Did you understand that a doublespend is not guaranteed to be successful? If theres a 5% chance of success its a shitty deal when the card is twice the pricecof its value. And thats the reason itvwas priced at 2k. If it wad priced at 1k and you could buy many of them, I guarantee you it would be double spent.

You can always have the $100 guy find a $1 bill on the ground if he looks all day, but thats not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about getting your money to work for you, and using your network as a force multiplier to get even more out of your investments.
And no, percentage is *not* all that matters. You can be absolute 100% sure that a guy with more money *will* make more than a guy without a lot of money (investing), simply for the fact that he already has a lot of money. This is indisputable. This is what I'm talking about when I say money make you more money.
If you think I'm saying that its not possible for a guy go from regular to super rich you've misunderstood me. And the more money you have, and the better connections (power) you have gets so powerful in the end that you in extreme circumstances end up with, for example russian oligarchs as was the entry to this discussion. They are so rich and powerful that the world is shaped *around them*. Its not inflation that got them where they are. Its money and power (mostly power in their case I'd argue though). If money and power didn't get you more money and power, which is what I said, there'd be no super rich people! I don't think anyone will ever claim anything else lol.


As I said, I'm not saying people can't make it in this world, and I'm definitely not saying being talented and working hard wont get you places either. And fyi, Gates and Buffet had some pretty powerful parents also, and I'm sure none of the others had a bad start either. A pretty good example of the power effect is Zuckerberg - He could be an excellent programmer and businessman, but had he not attended Harward with the Winklevoss twins he most likely wouldn't have created Facebook in the first place.
Heres also a pretty good idea of what happens when you start to become "Buffet rich":


In other words, he bets on stocks with low, yet stable returns, and he amplifies those returns by betting with cheap borrowed money.
**That second part is key because not everyone has access to the type of cheap financing one can get when one is a billionaire backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation betting on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks. **
When you get a lot of money and power, completely new doors open up for you that are simply closed to every other person, and I'm sure that if you ask anyone on that list there, if money and power can get you more money and power the answer will be a resounding yes. They all know the importance of having capital and network.

Just a stupid question, if its a problem to keep LN online all the time hows he supposed to keep the filebazaar app running also?
Also, he doesnt need to empty his channel first before recieving. Its possible to have a node open a channel to him - ex. he makes a channel, funds 0, counterparty funds 1 btc, and he pays fee. Counterparty is incentivized as he can get some tx fees this way. 
Another possibility is the merchant opens a channel somewhere, and node operators see an opportunity to create a good route and make some fees.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:02:32
I am pretty sure this is exactly it. Segwit *did* increase blocksize, which is what he wanted, but it wasnt his vision or face that guided that developement, so he had to spread FUD (like segwit is not bitcoin lol), and in the end back a fork where he could be seen more as the front figure, or leader.

Not that I disagree at all, but if you had a huge table of nonces you want to try so you dont try the same one more than one time you would get slightly increasing chance every time.

Yes, but if he's already running the filebazaar app 24/7 its very odd to make it seem like this is a problem specific to LN. The whole point is that if you run an online store you've already got servers running anyways, so I simply can't see the problem with LN also having to be online at the same time.

The change address is usually new, but can easily be the same as a previous one, but that would decrease cryptographic security I believe.
As you can see, its not always possible to tell which if the tx' is the real one and which is the double spent one, and thats the whole point. If it was possible we wouldn't even need the blockchain.


Its not possible to know. All you know is that you increase your chances of being successful by doing this. Remember, you don't need to be successful every time as attempting double spending is free.


This is *not* a concensus rule. Its not even possible to implement this as a concensus rule. If it was you wouldn't need the blockchain because then the network would already have reached concensus on which tx is the real one, and which is the double spent one. This process is what mining blocks is for.


No. As you can see (on doublespend.cash), the XT nodes don't use that policy. They just relay any tx they see. Miners are also free to implement whatever mempool policy they want.


Again no. The POS system I've seen promoted on rbtc relies on an SPV model. This is the absolutely worst solution you can think off. Here you must trust the node you are connected to that the tx you recieve is valid, plus there is no monitoring of the network for double spends. Monitoring of the network for double spends is the absolutely most important tool to warn merchants that a double spend is being attempted, and thats why bitpay and other payment processors are much safer than simply doing it yourself with a simple SPV POS setup, and thats the whole problem. For 0-conf to be reasonably secure you need to have a 3rd party process your payments (like paypal) or run a whole network of monitoring nodes.
Also, if the 0-conf model is relied on heavily on bcash it becomes an excellent attack vector. You can completely destroy trust in 0-conf by simply setting up a mining pool that does not forward transactions. Anyone can send the double spend to them, and depending on the hashrate you get a proportional chance of double spend success (5% hashrate -&gt; 5% double spend success). To put this in perspective, if 0.5% of the bitcoin hashrate decided to do this it would most likely fuck bcash over completely, because the *whole model* relies on 0-conf being safe. But its fundamentally flawed, and there is no fix for this kind of attack.

Wrt whatever history has come before, I can tell you as a relative newcomer that the rbtc crowd seems batshit insane. Ive formed my own opinion about scaling and I happen to agree with cores approach, but what I do find odd is why people in the crypto space form their opinion of how bitcoin should proceed, based on how well they like the particular moderation of a reddit sub or a forum.

Who cares? The point is not that it should be successful every time. At 5% doublespend chance you get on average 5% discount on every purchase (attempting doublepend is free).


They are extremely profitable. They are free to attempt. Just send an extra tx. You might be lucky. If not, you just end up paying what you were supposed to for the item you wanted.

Thats why I'm wondering how eclair mobile wallet has actually implemented routing - more specifically, does it calculate route itself, or does it have a 3rd party LN node do this, but if you don't know, then never mind.

You don't understand how probability works.
Are you serious btw?


If you think that saves you in any way the rbtc misinformation machine has been very effective. You simply send the tx at the same time. As propagation through the network is not instant there will be a race for the two tx to reach the different destinations. And you've also got a problem with these brilliant Bitcoin XT node implementations that simply relay *every thing they see*. A miner could tap into that network and just mine whatever tx he sees with the highest fee.


Pretty simple. Identify mining nodes, send your double spend tx there. Attempt to identify the merchants node - if he's a local guy try to send it to a local node. That will probably increase your chances of the double spend getting mined, and the merchant only seeing the "real tx" that wont be mined.
You might have a harder time tricking a real payment processor because they can have setup deals with miners to monitor their mempools, and they most definately run a network of nodes listening for double spends. But if this is the model you wish to pursue, then you're not really your own bank any longer and you might have better luck using paypal.

While graphene "compresses" blocks 99.5% and compact blocks do 98%, it comes most likely at a cost of higher latency.

Well, I was more thinking about a model where you have your funds in a pegged sidechain, you open a channel there on the "sidechain LN" and the node you connect to is also connected in the bitcoin network. This way its possible to have many such sidechains, but all connected though the larger bitcoin LN network. The sidechains can maybe have a lesser mining security model, or be a DAG or whatever to process tx fast without compromising the mainnet.

You are now trying to tell me what the rules of "my game" is. As you could read in the OP i defined that what I am looking for is how much the hash beat the difficulty. This is what we are discussing. We are not talking about the likelihood of the next hash to beat the difficulty. I am not talking about the binary less than/greater than hash difficulty. It says directly in the OP that I am talking about how much the hash exceeded the difficulty. This is the subject I am talking about.
It is much more unlikely to beat the difficulty when you start to select hashes from a smaller subset of valid hashes. This is not really that odd, and is exactly the same as in my dice game.
For example. Lets say I win by rolling the million sided die by rolling less than 11. Now, its much more likely that I will win when rolling numbers 1-10 than I will win only rolling numbers 1-5. Thus, I have to be more lucky to win by rolling numbers 1-5 than 1-10.
I am only asking this question because I am wondering something like: which hash, from a low difficulty block could be accepted as valid in a very high difficulty block. Imagine we have a simple linear difficulty adjustment - which hash from a block could be accepted in a block furthest in the future. The further down in time you go, the more unlikely it is the hash would be accepted as low enough. In other words, the more you beat the current difficulty, the luckier roll it would be.
Just imagine if there was a hash from 2010 that could beat the difficulty in a block from 2018. It would be very unlikely, sure. One could almost say you'd have to be very lucky for that to happen.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:48:52
when people ask me i usually ask them if they are just interested in the tech or tve mad gainz.
if they are interested in the tech i just give some btc, but if they are just FOMO i tell them to put their money in BITCOIN XBT thats an etn in europe and tradable in their own banks. much less hassle for them with tax, trusting exchanges and storing btc safely.
also I tell them: say goodbye to your money. treat it as its completely gone. have NO feelings regarding the price.

@_date: 2018-12-04 07:20:26
Yes, you generate lots of hashes so one of them is lucky enough to beat the difficulty. What I am curious about is what hash has beat the difficulty by the most (relatively speaking)
Theoretically you could have hashed a low enough value in block that would be the difficulty in a block today. It would be extremely unlikely, but extremely lucky.

lol great timing
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:52:58


Absolutely! The rules of mining is *only* about beating difficulty
But that is not what about just beating difficulty. I am talking about beating difficulty by the largest amount. (edit) It would be like a game of dice where you have to roll less than 10, but also roll less than your opponents. Transferring this analogy to Bitcoin and my example, the other players would be hashes in other blocks, and "rolling less than your opponents" would be considered in a relative sense, instead of absolute numbers.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:32:19
Can we agree you have to be more lucky to roll less than 5 than you have to roll less than 10?
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:31:04
Find me a definition of luck. Usually luck is used to represent differences in probabilities, which is exactly what is possible to do in this case. Just like how you say that you have to be more lucky to win the jackpot in the lottery, than one of the smaller prizes
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:43:40
Well, thats not quite what I mean...
A blocks hash must be better than the difficulty, like for example (completely dreamt up), the difficulty would be 1000, and I was lucky to mine a hash of 990. Now the next miner comes along and is incredibly lucky and mines a hash of 100 - thats ten times less than the needed value.
Now, I imagine that throughout bitcoin history there have been some incredibly "lucky" hashes when you look at it like this.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:51:17


I thought I made myself pretty clear. I'm not talking about the probability of obtaining one arbitrary hash - that should hopefully be the same for all hash values. In essence I'm talking  about hashes belonging to increasingly smaller groups of hashes.
This is the difference. This is why you can talk about different probabilities. You need to be more lucky to get a number belonging to the set 1-5 than the set 1-10. This is why we can phrase it as luck.
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:07:14
Yes, they all beat the difficulty here, but as I said, lucky in the context im talking about is rolling a number belonging to an even lower subset of valid rolls (see my OP).
I know its not harder to roll a 10 than a 1, but rolling a number lower than 5 is harder than rolling a number lower than 10. This is what I mean when I talk about luck.
You could phrase is as "required rolls before you roll x" but that is not how chance works. We can only talk about expected rolls giving you a certain chance of acheiving a certain roll.


That is in essence what I wrote in the OP. This is how I defined being lucky there.
But I dont want to discuss semantics.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:13:05

@_date: 2018-12-21 18:21:26
Think of it this way: do you think regulators care whether bitcoins are moved by mining or routing on LN? You really have to ask yourself why one, and not the other?
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:00:17
Oh yes it does :)
Exactly like in the dice game. Even if the condition is that you win when you roll 10 or less, it requires you to be more lucky to win by only rolling a number from 1-5 than it does from 1-10. You would need to be equally lucky to roll a number from 2-6 as you would for a number 1-5 though.
The difference here is that, as I said in the OP I wanted to see how much the difficulty was beat, in essence talking about hashes from 1-x. **It is more likely to beat the difficulty by more than 1 than it is to beat it by more than 10**
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:03:26

However, he is often dead wrong (bitcoin fees kill babies), misrepresenting quotes (look in the OP image) and peddling bcash as Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-05 11:01:29


Why do you keep on ignoring what I write? I said very plainly, and its in the OP:


I am not simply talking about mining a hash that simply beats the difficulty! I have no idea why you would think that, unless you didn't bother to read my post.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:47:39
I agree, that value should be less than 1 for all blocks (otherwise they are not valid). The first thing that could be interesting is what that average value is for each difficulty (average of what.. 14 days of blocks?).
Id expect the value to be 0.99xxxxx or something like that, and if there is no trend in this value over all "block difficulties" it would be a good measure of "luck " for each hash.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:56:33
None of them necessarily beats the difficulty by a large amount
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:51:14
Seriously, I have no idea how its possivle, but old channel states are invalidated by newer channel states.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:13:58


I think its best explained like this: It is more likely to beat the difficulty by more than 1 than it is to beat it by more than 10. But leave that discussion for now, you can read about it elsewhere in this post.


Definately, but I dont really know how to make that script, and secondly, I am not sure about how *exactly* to quantify this "beating the difficulty relatively". One guy suggested simply doing blockhash/target, but I am not sure its that simple. Secondly, I'd like to know how improbable that event was - that is, how unlikely is it that you would mine a hash low enough in 2010 that would be valid in a block from 2018 - would such an event be so improbable that it would defy what we would expect?
@_date: 2018-12-04 07:49:20
Thats not how chance works. We can talk about how many guesses on average you would need to expect a hash below a certain value.
Imagine a million sided die, you want to roll below 10. Very roll has the same chance no matter how many previous tries. What im curious about is what the luckiest roll has been, and defining luck as the value beating the success condition by the most. For example rolling a 1 under this definition is more lucky than 9, even if they are both successful (and completely unrelated to how many previous rolls you did).
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:43:48

@_date: 2018-12-03 22:56:21
Not just the lowest. In comparison with the difficulty. Just to see what the biggest "sigma event" or what you would call it was. Like, have we mined a hash so lucky it would only happen once in a lifetime
It could be in block  or in block 
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:22:22
You are welcome to measure the support any way you want, fact of the matter is that there was *not enough support*. If there was enough support you can be sure there would have been a hard fork. There wasn't, so its self evident that there was not enough support.
Another hint that there was not enough support is that there were always cliebts ready to accept bigger blocks - classic, bu, xt etc, but there was never generated a block bigger than 1 mb. Thats because if that would happen the bigblock chain would ve orphaned very fast by the small block chain. In fact, thats why bcash had to implement replay protection to force a permanent hardfork. If it had not, bcash would continue to be orphaned all the time.
Deciding what is comitted matters not fot a second, because anyone can fork the code and run whatever they want.
What you have to realize is that concensus rules are not decided by a democracy by voting.

Exactly. Its not so much that miners soft forked, its that they did it without disclosing these new rules. Thats "unethical" but ultimately a property of the concensus protocol, but imo is "fair game". The real problem is though, that you only needed 1? 2? miners to do this? Thats the real problem and shows just how centralized the bcash mining business is in reality. Now the problem arises that, if they can decide to censor some tx, whats to stop them from censoring others? Thats the real problem - well for them lol.

data protection laws (and fines) are absolutely necessary for this to work like that. but MS has positioned in an extremely good spot here in case legislation becomes tougher. i like the fact that they chose bitcoin for this, because otherwise, how can they convince anyone that *they* dont just abuse their own centralized solution?

Or maybe keep it in eth? Who knows if its gonna be eth = xbt + bch or eth &gt; btc + bch.
