Thanks for your input.

Hilarious. I'm 100% female, sir. Not a spammer. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:46:06
I'm just entirely too busy to deal with negative people. Just don't follow. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:59:58
It might!
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:18:01
Good question 
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:59:40
Completely agree.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:48:38
 you are right, looks like the author of the article mistyped. I didn't peruse the article, just a quick read. :) 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:46:24
Nope. Didn't know that. So many rude and negative commentators on reddit.. My guard is up, I guess. Good grief guys, why all the negativity?
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:48:53
Ha. My bad. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:42:53
Don't follow. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:01:01
It is a documentary, watching the "revolution" happen. There will be many follow ups, I'm sure. It's a small budget, documentary.

PayPal is not releasing the funds you sent us under the name 'Ashley Narvis'.   They've asked us to verify your identity (which is what my last few emails were about).  For some reason, PayPal is assuming these charges are fraudulent.
It's also worth pointing out that your 'Ashely Narvis' Facebook page ( and Twitter ( are BRAND NEW.  Also, you commented on another Reddit post where you brag about being a scam artist and selling counterfeit goods:   
Anyway, I've received your latest email with your newest email address.  I will attempt to email you at that address.

According to stats, 95% of bitcoin users are male.

You brag about selling illegal goods on Ebay, and don't see a problem with that??  Okay...
With regards to your PayPal purchase, I've explained the issue to you in numerous emails.  You simply refuse to confirm your identity.  I've sent you instructions on how to do so, but you simply refuse.  Why?  Your Facebook and Twitter accounts are brand new, and you can't confirm that you are in fact Ashely Narvis... That's more than a little strange.
With regards to 8gxe, his cyber sleuth skills are a little lacking.  A little more digging would have revealed that SEVERAL companies utilize the same Executive Office as we do.  The executive office is simply a place to receive mail, conduct correspondence, and hold meetings if and when they become necessary.  To say it has "nothing to with Coinfirma" is beyond shortsighted.
You are welcome to keep spouting on Reddit if it suits you.  However, the fact remains, I've sent you instructions on how to rectify your account and you're refusing to do so.  The question remains, WHY?
Have fun with Reddit.  We'll be awaiting your response via our regular customer support channels.

Yep... I think I'll lurk. Not even a "girl"? Oh, contraire. :) 
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:39:00
Absolutely not. For the masses, meaning, commercially, I think keeping the conversation at a level which the general population can understand is important. Adding some humor; getting it out there in a way that is more relatable to women would help tremendously. All across the internet when you see Bitcoin, you see the same old boring gold coin and tech talk, I think they're disinterested, and a bit intimidated.   - I see that changing very slowly... Bitcoin is interesting, it's fascinating, it is watching history in the making. I want to get more women involved. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:07:42
To each, their own. :) I just think it is cute and catchy. I am 100% woman, "girl" in the sense that I am "girly". Everything is not that serious, and I'm not offended to be called a girl at all. In fact, the older I get, the less offensive it becomes. Ha.

Hi Ashely,
I (Jennifer) have responded to all of your emails.  We've been awaiting your response.  As my email to you earlier today stated, please review your emails and send us a reply.
You also stated on Twitter (and in one of your emails) that I deleted one of your tweets to me.  That's not possible to do.  I don't have the ability to delete your tweets.
Again, please review our previous emails to you and respond.
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:40:45
Because that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:30:52
Ha! And I make smiley faces ;) . 
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:46:18
Ha! Love the Meme. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:08:11
Yes!
