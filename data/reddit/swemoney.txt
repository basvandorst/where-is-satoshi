Downloaded, signed up and it's all looking pretty great! Any chance of getting a "watched" feature. Not a huge fan of Blockchain.info (their app is garbage) but I really like being able to watch any wallet.
Keep up the great work! As a fellow app developer, I don't imagine why Apple would take this down.

I actually made my first BitCoin purchase yesterday and it took a good 5+ hours to start confirmation. After I got the first one, the rest came pretty quick. I was a little worried since it was a large (to me) purchase. So I guess, like everyone else has stated, just give it some more time.

Hold steady, friend! I got in near the top of the last bubble (~$200) and saw her drop to $50 a few days later. I kept telling myself that I'm in this for the long haul and stopped obsessing over it's price and am now pleasantly pleased. In a few months, you'll be laughing about this. :)

I love this idea (even though I'm still waiting for my Pebble which I'm pretty sure will never come. Damn you orange!). I'd replace the On MtGox on the bottom with the actual time (sometimes it's nice to know what time it is) and I wouldn't expect real time. Give me every 5 minutes and I'm happy. Also, I haven't looked at the SDK documentation or anything yet so I'm unsure if it's possible, but setting up some sort of alert when the price gets to certain points would be awesome!

I'd love to see an exchange built from the bottom to scale to the demand. I'm a little too new to bitcoin to be much help with all the back end stuff, but I'd love to contribute in some way elsewhere.

Haha. I hope it gets to that point in the future. I'm in for the long haul now.

I was in the same boat as you. Heard about and always meant to "look into it" a couple years ago. Kicking myself for it now but I got in yesterday at $180/btc. I did a lot of reading on wikipedia. A few google searches to figure out what mining was. And weusecoins.com was a pretty nice introduction to everything for me. I decided to go with the original BitCoin-Qt client on my mac.
