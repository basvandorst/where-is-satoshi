This was my logic as well, but I didn't want the IRS knocking on my door.

Let's say you want to buy 10 btc. Someone is selling 8 btc at $17000, and someone else is selling another 8 at $17250. If you wanted to buy 10 btc, you would buy all of the btc at $17000, and then you would have to buy he remaining 2 you want at $17250. This is how the price increases. A sell wall occurs when there is an extremely large amount at a certain price, for example, 1000 btc at $17250. This means that the price will not increase until all of that is purchased.

Did you honestly think bitcoin would go past $5000 though? It seems like literally every time there is a high, it lasts a couple days then drops 20%. Happened at 3k, 4K, 5k.

True, but if you are looking to maximize your return selling at 5k would have been ideal, just like buying at 2,000 would have been a month ago or 3,000 recently. If you want, you could obviously just buy at any time and then wait a few months or a year to make your money back.

Naw you are just a shitty trader lmao if you started with 1.8 btc you could easily have like 4 now if you sold during the highs and rebought during the lows you would easily have at least 3 btc by now. 
Edit: I didn't read you post carefully enough; you were up 3.5 btc, how in the world can you fuck that up?
