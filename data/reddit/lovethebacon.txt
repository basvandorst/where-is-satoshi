You do know that NYSE isn't doing the pricing, they are just doing the reporting? Would you rather they didn't take any interest at all and just flat out ignored cryptos?

They are valueing, not trading.
Some are questioning exactly where they source their data from, and if from multiple sources what their weightings are. In truth, we're probably going to see multiple indices over the next while. 
It would be interesting to see FTSE's thoughts on carrying a Bitcoin index.

The only reason why banks can't get involved now is that the anonymity of transactions is against regulation. Sure, cash is as well, but cash requires you to present yourself to the person you're transacting with. In some countries, AML/KYC laws are somewhat lax for low balance accounts.
What is having an impact now is using a blockchain as a ledger.

This is moronic. 
Transfering a few million USD in cash is difficult as fuck. And illegal to cross most borders without reporting it for many reasons including AML (Anti-Money Laundering). 
Transferring a few million USD in bitcoin is easy. It's much easier to launder with bitcoin. That's not a fault in bitcoin, that's a feature. Any government backed crypto will have a way to identify all parties involved in a transaction.
This naive shit needs to stop.

Literal salt. Large granules spread over the surface. Throwing on an uneven on should eliminate most of the bias in unfair dice. 
EDIT: make some sense better.

~~Thanks, but I mean sources of entropy.~~
EDIT: Oh, nevermind, I'm misunderstanding the entire thing

What are your sources?

You type them in. A hex string is a human readable representation of the binary string that computers use.
