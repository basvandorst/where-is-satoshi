To be fair, though, like 99% of the noise would be from all the fans. Noise requires something to be moving, and ASICs are solid state, so they wouldn't really make any noise on their own.

This menu is so ridiculous it's beautiful.

Still takes longer to say.

They would need to knock the hashrate down for more than a few hours to bring the difficulty down. The network difficulty is only changed every couple of weeks to target a 10 minute block solve time.

Because saying "I have ฿10m" is too easily confused by most people. I can already hear the masses saying "10 million?! That's a lot!" The / makes it very clear that this doesn't mean what it usually would. It gives the mark a special meaning that the letter m alone wouldn't. Just using "m" would be like saying "I have $10c". Sure, you probably know what it means, but someone new to the US currency system would have no clue ("Ten centidollars?").

I never said difficulty was based on money or profitability. My question was regarding incentives for mining at all. Profitability keeps going down, so pretty soon, there won't be any reason to mine. At that point, the hash rate will start going down. Even if profitability goes up because of the decrease in hash rate, the block reward will be halved eventually, thus negating any effect that would have. I find it extremely unlikely that people would continue running up their power bills for nothing in return.
My question has been answered, but I just wanted to clear up what exactly I was asking/concerned about.

It's doing fine now, yes, but for roughly six hours, approximately 250 TH/s of the network was down (probably due to those miners not having a backup pool set up). If anything, this should be a lesson to always configure a backup pool.

Just like ฿0.00000004 is the standard format for BTC.
Since Bitcoin can be divided into more than 0.01, it is much more convenient to use a symbol to represent all those zeroes. 4 Satoshi's is way easier to say than "point oh oh oh oh oh oh oh four Bitcoins" or "four one hundred millionths of a Bitcoin". The ₥ is a middle ground for when both the Satoshi and the conventional system are less convenient.

Ah, okay. That makes a lot more sense. So the tx fees are supposed to eventually replace the block rewards. Do you think that the tx fees would have any impact on the overall value of BTC in the future? Like, if the fees became high enough, would that negatively affect the value of BTC, since it would cost more to use it? Or would the fees start to level out at a reasonable amount per transaction in the block?

Sorry if I'm asking the same thing for the millionth time; I did a search before posting, but didn't find anything that would lead me to believe this was a repost. And, with all due respect, I'm not that concerned about someone with -1318 comment karma. 
Thanks, though for the information. I had heard that, over time, the main motivator would be fees, but surely that wouldn't take over the block reward for years, would it? I mean, 25 BTC transaction fees sound a bit ridiculous. Even 12.5 BTC fees seem pretty crazy to me. Why would anyone use a system with the equivalent of a thousand-ish dollar transaction fee?

It's a completely valid way of saying it, but the point is that mBTC takes longer to say. Using the mill you only write one symbol and that symbol has a one-syllable pronunciation. The standard way works, but the mill is just simpler (and more easily understood). "Ten mills" is way quicker than "ten millibitcoins" or even "ten m - b - t - c".

A lot of the miners allow you to set up backup pools, so if your main one stops responding, it can try to connect to the other one, thus keeping downtime to a minimum.
