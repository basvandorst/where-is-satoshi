TREZOR Statement on SegWit2X Hard Fork
SegWit2X is a proposed fork of Bitcoin, to upgrade the blocksize to 2MB according to the New York Agreement. The fork is scheduled to occur at block height 494784 (around November 16). As this is a contentious hard fork, Bitcoin will most likely split in two after this block, with Bitcoin (BTC) and SegWit2X (B2X) emerging.
If you have held BTC on your TREZOR before the fork, you will own the same amount of BTC and B2X after the fork.
With TREZOR, you own your private keys (in the form of the seed), therefore you have control over all of your coins, including forked coins.
TREZOR device supports both BTC and B2X.
The TREZOR device supports both BTC and B2X. For both, new and legacy addresses will be supported.
However, as SegWit2X will not implement replay protection, there are certain steps you need to take before you can use both coins safely. We will prepare a guide for you to follow, should you wish to split your coins and use both coins.
Disambiguation: The fork ahead.
If you only care about BTC and don’t need B2X, no action is required. Use your bitcoin as you would normally.
If you only care about B2X and don’t need BTC, no action is required. Use your B2X as you would use other coins. See the end of the splitting guide.
If you want both BTC and B2X, please follow the guide below to split the coins correctly. Note that this process is manual and is without any warranties, due to the lack of replay protection.
Important note: This is not the same process as during Bitcoin Cash fork
Bitcoin Cash implemented replay protection during their hard fork, meaning the coin splitting process was easier to implement. Please take all precautions, and pay close attention to the guide.
