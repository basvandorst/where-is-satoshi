As an electrical engineer and a bitcoin enthusiast I want to say ... you're living the dream :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:40:50
Thank you ... :)

maybe you're right we don't know that yet but even if OpenBazzar didn't deliver what it promised I think it is a matter of time until some project will establish a completely free market

Very glad someone in Sudan is trying to promote bitcoin I think it can help solving a lot of problems in the country like inflation and sanctions.
By the way I am Sudanese and live in Khartoum and I like to be part of this group.

The world only moves forward, throughout history there were people who stood against technology but at the end they were proven wrong.
“Everything that can be invented has been invented.” Charles H. Duell, US Patent Office in 1902
“640K ought to be enough for anybody.” Bill Gates
eventually Bitcoin will succeed and they will regret judging it too fast.

Don't worry I know I am not genius :) ... it looks like Satoshi had thought of everything ... thanks for the info

It will be different, hopefully a better place

History is full of examples, If they don't incorporate bitcoin they will end up like Kodak
The world only moves forward

that's a stupid move from Groupon it will only hurt their reputation

But the transaction fees are too low for the huge power hungry mining machines

With bitcoin everyone is generous :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:01:49
Thanks .... 
state full of awesome people like you :)

Same thing happened to me. I am new to bitcoin and I asked a question about it and some people were rude (but not all of them to be fair).
To avoid that I never ask questions here.

Most of what you described is being built right now 
Check out Maidsafe, Etherium, and OpenBazaar
We are witnessing a revolution

Totally agree with you I have a LOT of pet projects but to me they are the most important projects in human history.

I mean a completely independent organization that no one can control and regulate ... not a state in the conventional meaning 
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:01:02
How about "be your own bank" 
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:45:51
It is wonderful to think that a guy sitting in his home in 2009 decided to invent Bitcoin (probably as a pet project) and few years latter it is a global phenomenon and maybe after another few years it will a currency the whole world will use.
Internet is so amazing
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:40:52
Awesome I am super excited about it and going to give it a try ... I wish I was a programmer so I can participate in this wonderful project ... but hey if at any point you need an electrical engineer I am your guy ;)
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:43:10
When the whole world start using Bitcoin you will be the one who's laughing
