yay it worked!! thank you!
so i stopped Bitcoin Core last night just to see what would happen - Google sent me a message saying that it blocked an attempted login to my email account, it was from my home address so Im assuming that was the script trying to log in, so maybe this is a non-runner :(
Also the mail was sent about 12 hrs after i closed Bitcoin Core, is this to do with the 3600 number in the script? thank you

I have a full bitcoin node running on linux, is it difficult to get an LN node running also? Hoping something like Bitcoin Core GUI is available for LN
