Interesting concept, but without a [1Password]( plugin a browser is pretty much useless to me.

So you're sort of right. I downloaded it and got it setup, but don't really love how it behaves (having to right-click to open my 1Password pane). Still, it's usable to the extent that I can give it a fair day in court. Thanks for the tip!

Shelters and rescues are two totally different things. Shelters are literally just shelters where they try (often not very hard) to do little more than keep the dogs alive. Rescues are different. Rescues will typically foster the dogs, test their temperament with people, dogs, cats, etc – and will often treat medical and emotional issues. So while a $25 or $100 adoption fee might be typical of a shelter, rescues will typically ask for a $200–400 fee.

Better that than pre-industustrial problems: Sky-high infant mortality, lack of access to clean water, lack of antibiotics, near zero access to health education, no artificial limbs or contact lenses, rampant STDs. I'd much rather be dealing with long-term exposure to pollutants that *might* shorten my lifespan to only twice the pre-industrial average.

Of course – Roman aqueducts, etc. However, industrialization allowed for water and sewage systems to be built at far lower prices and much faster, enabling their construction in cities and townships that would never have had access to such things prior to industrialization.

If there's no difference why would you favor the method that is involuntary?
And you think regulation means not leaving things to chance? Please. It seems far more likely that the regulators will act unethically, either intentionally or through pure incompetence.

History shows nothing of the sort. The standard of living has increased exponentially in the last 100 years, not because of regulation but because profit incentivized innovations which made possible products that improve our quality of life.
Regulation makes it more difficult for new businesses to get established as oftentimes only the larger players can afford to keep compliant and pay associated regulatory fees and taxes. In that way, government actually increases the chance for monopoly power to consolidate.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:18:40
I will totally admit there are times when regulation may serve some short term positive outcome, but in the end, regulation is coercion without consent and that is always morally wrong, regardless of the outcome.

There's quite a bit of difference. Keeping your customers happy by listening to and addressing their concerns is just good business. Regulation takes that dialog and puts it in the hands of bureaucrats who are often less informed and slower to react than the customers. And while it should be rather obvious I'll also point out that whatever "service" regulators provide comes at the expense of both the customer and the business via taxation.

Public health projects...made possible by industrialization.
@_date: 2014-08-03 13:22:44
There was no call for regulation here. When customers band together to change a business' behavior that's not an appeal to regulation — it's proof regulation wasn't needed to solve the problem.

It took more than 5 years after the internet was widely used before more than a tiny fraction of users had made ANY purchase online. Did that mean ecommerce was a failure? No. To the contrary, nearly every new tech has an incubation period where its only users are a small group of early adopters.

Wait, LinkedIn was founded by Chris Christie?

I don't see how that refutes my statement. You might be able to build a case that industrialization's effect medical research was dubious, but without industrialization, large scale production of and widespread access to disinfectants, antibiotics, etc, wouldn't be possible.

Libertarianism isn't about not helping those in need. It's about not forcing others to aid in your quest.

For me, it's not about being "split" — it's about people having a real choice between two distinct viewpoints. Establishment Republicans and Democrats go to great lengths to paint themselves as different from one another, but on many of the most critical issues, such as the Patriot Act, they are in lockstep.

By supporting minimum wage, you favor a centralized authority defining the terms of contracts between individuals.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:53:02
Umm, in many ways the government *created* the ISP monopolies in the US. The Telecommunications Act basically granted regional exclusivity to those operators who aided in the installation of fiber networks.
Comparing minimum wage to slavery is just absurd. Obviously slavery is in opposition to individual rights and liberties. Well, a minimum wage actually opposes our rights and liberties as well. You're basically saying that unskilled and inexperienced workers aren't legally allowed to exercise their primary comparative advantage: low prices. In a bigger picture sense, though, you're inhibiting the rights of both businesses and workers to negotiate freely, according to the terms that best suit both parties.

Wait, so you favor decentralized currency but also centralized control over how it's exchanged?

One of the best parts of libertarianism is that people can live according to their own values, so long as they don't impose through coercion those values upon others.

Yes, how would people ever manage without our beneficent government protecting us from the evils of the world?

For starters, without a government the concept of a "country" wouldn't really be relevant, but I digress. Plenty has been written about the concepts of [polycentric law]( and [market anarchy]( Essentially, you replace poorly functioning (and arguably illegitimate) governmental entities with competitive market-based alternatives who are funded through voluntary means. I love [this summary by David Friedman](

It's more like acknowledging that central planners are terrible at designing cars and deciding you'd prefer to choose from one of the many superior cars developed by the marketplace.
