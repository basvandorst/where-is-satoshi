If you use ios Breadcoin is the best, if you use android use mycelium or Samourai (small amounts as samoruai I believe is still beta, I trust and use it for walking around cash) If on a computer.. bitcoin core or electrum, If you want hardware wallet use Ledger nano with starter, Keepkey, or my personal favorite Trezor

XC is real ANNON....XC’s custom built platform is built with a newly created network protocol that is encrypted – protecting the transaction end to end. Using a decentralized pool of Xnodes, the transactions are untraceable from sender to receiver. XC’s platform takes it to the next step by using multi-path technology to relay the transaction between multiple Xnodes and split the transaction into numerous micro-transactions. This prevents any single Xnode from knowing the true source and destination of the transaction. The micro-transactions also limit risk due to the nature of splitting 1 transaction into numerous transactions spread out across  a pool of Xnodes.
XC will be available on mobile platforms to provide real-time NFC and P2P communication, encrypted real-time instant messaging, and retail transaction support for Point of Sales. This is only the beginning, over the next few months the wallet will be updated to support all sorts of applications that can be used - including a marketplace, asset transfers, and digital contracts.....XC FTW

Best way is to to use  then convert BTC to Dash or Shadow, and use their mixing process, I would recommend shadow since it uses Non-interactive Zero Knowledge Proofs, Also you could mix them with XMR through shapeshift as well since they use crypto-note tech. But the main thing to do is just send your btc through a few different coins on shapeshift then convert right back to BTC, simple fast way to completely remove your link, just dont send them back to original address. If your really paranoid send them back to a Electrum wallet running on a TAILS Operating system to an address you have no tie to ;) Hope that helped.

 How it works?
BitBall is a bitcoin lottery based on the US Powerball lottery. The winning numbers drawn twice a week for the normal US based lottery Powerball will be the same winning numbers for bitball. Since the jackpot for bitball is extremely less than powerball and we will sell fewer tickets, Bitball will only use the first four numbers drawn from the powerball numbers. If you match those numbers in any order players will win the Bitball jackpot. The game play works like this…
    Players can buy tickets for .01 bitcoins
    Each ticket has 4 numbers on it between 1 and 59. (either chosen by random or picked by the player)
    If those 4 numbers match the first 4 numbers of the powerball drawing the player wins the Bitball jackpot.
    The Jackpot will start at 15 bitcoins and go up 2 bitcoins every time there is no winner.
    If a player matches 3 of the powerball number they will win .1 bitcoins.
    If more than 1 player wins the jackpot it will be split amount the winners.
    Drawings are every Wednesday and Saturday night at 10:59 p.m. Eastern Time.
    Ticket buying will be suspended 1 hour before a drawing and resume 1 hour after.

ALll of you who think any of this will make btc anon are delusional or honestly just dont understand, privacy by opt-in is a failed model.. the hurdles for this Tech
1) Segwit must 1st be activated... at this rate who knows when that will happen, if it even does 
2) This technology will be implemented on a ***Transparent*** blockchain which is still susceptible to black listing and white listing and since this tech is optional they can just go after those who opt-in to use it or Black list the coins
 
3) Its opt-in privacy = fundamentally flawed from the start

@_date: 2015-07-12 19:26:04
Cool concept, I can get behind this as it will make adoption easier for some. Just used this to give my roommate $10.00 worth of bitcoin he moved it to a new envelope(money packet) with out setting up a wallet and has it saved to his comp. My roommate who has been intrigued with BTC of lately had troubles grasping the concept of the BTC wallet, so saving the money packet on his comp just as he would a file took no learning curve at all. I see this as a nice entry point for those curious about BTC but are below the technical learning curve at the moment.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!

Relevant quotes:
"At a deeper level, our results suggest a fundamental rethinking of the role of block rewards in cryptocurrency design. The prevailing view is that the block reward is a necessary but temporary evil to achieve an initial allocation of coins in the absence of a central authority."
"So perhaps designers of new cryptocurrencies should make the block reward permanent and accept monetary inflation as inevitable. Transaction fees would still exist, but merely as an incentive for miners to include transactions in their blocks."
This is why Monero was designed with a perpetual block reward.
