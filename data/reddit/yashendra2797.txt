Did I miss out... AGAIN?

Crash and rise crash and rise crash and rise.
All I'm gonna do is HODL.
And maybe buy some chump change whenever its crashing to ~10350.

Hodl=hold=don't sell there's a crash. Its a meme after a guy drunk posted on a bitcoin forum how he was gonna 'hodl' on to BTC after the first crash.

No idea. :/

That's the market dude.

Coinome charges 0.1%. Its by Billdesk. Launched last week. Seems stable enough. And is fully legal because of KYC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:38
Maybe yeah.

Which is why its an investment. Nothing is sure shot in this world dude. If you invest in say a stock, you don't just put the money and sell it a year later. You look at data, read papers, and look at analysts' predictions. Unlike stocks however, BTC is a tiny bit simpler as you can have notifications on for apps, and set auto sell orders when BTC goes below ~10% the amount you bought it at... But if you have a flash crash like with what happened with ETH (1 ETH=$30 for a few minutes and then back again to normal) you're screwed.
TL;DR: Nothing in life is risk free. Especially investments. Hedge your bets. Do your research.

Switch to Coinome.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:55:54
Coinome is the answer!

Speculation. BTC got quite a lot of legitimacy a few months ago due to several governments accepting it, then traders announced that they're gonna start investing into it. Now its snowballing. The higher the price is getting, the more people are buying it, leading to the price going higher, and the cycle continues.

 is working. So far.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:10:06
0.1-0.3% commission on sales and buys, current buy is INR 894000.00, current sell is INR 892002.00. Plus its by Billdesk, who I trust a lot more than a startup. And the transfers that I have done so far have been instantaneous.
Withdrawing BTC to another exchange is 0.001 BTC though.
EDIT: If you mean rates are high as in INR to USD conversion, well yeah. They will be. Always. GDAX/Coinbase is just one exchange. Prices are *significantly* higher in other regional exchanges, for example South Korea, which has always been very technologically advanced, and Zimbabwe, where more and more people are prefering to use BTC for investment due to the *extremely* high inflation and volatile government.

At the risk of being that guy, this is stealing. You can't just pick apples from someone else's orchard.
I mean I get why BTC is awesome but this comic has a fault. 
Just saying.
And no its not like piracy, piracy doesn't overtly hurt the creator/owner.
