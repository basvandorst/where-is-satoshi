Three weeks ago we'd be calling that $350M more like $600M. I'm tempted to call it $200M and count everything above that valuation as a bonus at this point.
Let's hope consumer sentiment is able to rally against the failure of some now hunted developers and maintain support of why BTC is an important financial vehicle.

Or more appropriately 
* We will be inside watching the security cameras and will use the escape tunnel accordingly.
* We are getting freaky with dozens of girls, no time to explain, life is short yo!

This is exactly where the problem resides. They're basically doing an audit. And they've come up extremely short. I don't think anyone actually knows how short? But let's call it what 5%? (50M) short. That's a lot of awkward explaining to do.

That's not the biggest problem. The real problem is that Gox need to audit their holdings to verify how much has been lost.

I agree. Furthermore from my experience paying people, which is much lesser than yours, is that employees value certainty in their rewards from their profession (generally subscribing to being fairly risk averse). Even if Wikimedia takes on the 'currency risk' at the point of transferring the BTC, you have employees speculating directly on that income and associating any highs and lows with their employment (do I sell today, maybe tomorrow). Or even worse, losing it due to security risks, which at this point is absolutely possible. It's a lose/lose right up to the point that cryptocurrencies provide more utility value, low volatility, with less hassle, and at least the same security (potentially also requiring traceability and accountability), as fiat currently does.
The risk categories that 401k/superannuation/retirement funds that employees choose are not associated with their employer. Employers are equally detached from the choices of their employees to buy a new performance car every six months, or put it into a trust for their children to attend college. 
Until you could pay your mortgage, car lease, food, etc with BTC it's only the independently wealthy or risk prone who might consider it a good idea.

Yea I'm tending to think it's more on the upper limit here.
The reason is that I think they'll find that several highly sophisticated criminals took significant advantage of the issue over the last few years. While it would be criminal, they can all hide behind the blanket of anonymity. 
And Gox can just throw their hands in the air, and say "ohwell, we're all off to an extended luncheon (for the next 20 years)"

Awww that's disappointing, one of the more pertinent questions in relation to the current events surrounding MtGox was down voted.

Agree. It is required that all implementations wait to complete the previous transaction in the chain. It's a slight 'slow down' but it actually is probably a GOOD slow down. 
It's a process of [eventual consistency](
