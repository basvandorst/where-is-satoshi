thanks for pointing that out too, you're on fire today. I should've put "as close to instant as possible for internet based transactions."

let's use another number for fun, like a $100mil transaction, saving $2.3mil on $100mil would be a big deal. 
 if all i had to do was spend a little extra time verifying an address to save that much money then it doesn't seem so bad. i don't think many people would turn down an extra $2.3mil for something so simple, but maybe they would which is why we should have the choice of using either system. either $102.3mil with insured sending capabilities or $100mil without.

I'd hope that if anyone was going to be making a large payment that they'd verify where the money was going prior to sending but I get your concern as well.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:04:33
no problem... i was obviously a little frustrated when i went to pay with the CC which is why i made the post.

sending 1 satoshi doesn't meet the the conditions (has to be .01btc or higher). read more under "Sending" if interested:

What's a current transaction fee? Around .0001btc per tx, right?
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:29:58
never heard of "enjoy sochi" transactions but i'd actually like to try this and probably will when i can (no coins on me right now so i have to wait). 
you probably know this already but certain conditions have to be met if you want to send for free:
   "It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.
    All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
    Its priority is large enough"

i've never had an issue with coins going to the wrong place even after typing an address in manually, and i'm talking hundreds of transactions, although it can obviously happen. just need to be a little more careful with larger amounts.

very far fetched, yes. i was thinking about someone buying a company... and let's say we remove all that and wanted to pay a person in the same room that amount of money, they'd be better off using Bitcoin because all other methods would be nearly impossible without scrutiny and obstacles. Bitcoin would be easier than any other method imaginable.

spending 60 seconds or less to verify where $ going before sending is worth the $350 if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:11:33
i'd rather take my chances if it means i can save a ton of money. it seems like there are many others who think the same way. if the $ goes to the wrong place then it's on me and i'd have no one to blame but myself because i knew the implications prior to sending... no different than a small gamble, risk/reward.

"Transaction fees are voluntary on the part of the person making the bitcoin transaction, as the person attempting to make a transaction can include any fee or none at all in the transaction. On the other hand, nobody mining new bitcoins necessarily needs to accept the transactions and include them in the new block being created. The transaction fee is therefore an incentive on the part of the bitcoin user to make sure that a particular transaction will get included into the next block which is generated."
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:06:54
in theory, yes, but it's not what usually happens. i've tested it with and without tx fees and every tx has been confirmed very quickly.  has anyone had a payment sit there for days after sending when choosing not to pay the tx fee? i've never heard about it happening.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:33:02
true, not the definition of scam, I guess "rip off" is more accurate.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:53:12
I wouldn't really worry about this if I was going to be paying a reputable company. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:54:45
Sending Bitcoin barely costs anything with current transaction fees (what is it? .0001btc?). If a company chose to use something like Bitpay then they'd be responsible for the 1% fee, not me.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:59:42
bank transfer is cheaper but takes longer. i only wanted to point out the cc fees after i was about to pay with the cc... it surprised me because i didn't see any mention of fees related to paying with a cc until i went to actually pay with the cc.

almost every post you've made indicates that you're the real pedant, not btcnr. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:00:57
True, I should've wrote "almost free." My apologies.
