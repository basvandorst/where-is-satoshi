I was originally interested if the “Buttcoiners” doubted DLT and Blockchain as an innovative technology. I understand they doubt this highly speculative market...
But having posted in that sub, I have seen various stances on  this emerging technology.
I now question, r/Bitcoin! In learning all that I can about Bitcoin, Blockchain/DLT, and Smart Contracts... how do these disruptive technologies affect businesses, economies and socioeconomics?

Indeed. We may see Gold price shoot up a LOT

Im sure no financial institution would loan me money to invest, let alone, bitcoin. 
How would you go about BS’ing your reason?

Seriously.. how do you get a loan from a bank to do this lol

Does that prevent world leaders from taking action?

I see striking resemblance between Gold and Bitcoin trend lines! Just a fact of similarities

Is there a subreddit for this kind of information? This is an interesting topic about the “dark side” of the US economy. This can help us prepare for the economic collapse we all foresee in ways other than Cryptocurrency

As Obama once mentioned, the future of America is here now. As more are birthed into newer generations, perception of the world changes and a bright future is born

Interesting reply. Cryptos are definitely getting into the spotlight. Whether governments decide to adopt, ban or work with... Bitcoin, blockchain and co are here to stay, steady with evolution. Many of the new cryptos will be well on there way to become something like that of Dash or Ethereum.
Along with the next big drop, i personally speculate up to an 80% drop. Considering the market demand for this amazing technological innovation of economics, the price will recover within months to blow past new all time highs
