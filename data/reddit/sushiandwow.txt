Well, I'm questioning it. :)
That's tongue in cheek. The sentiment you express is common enough in this subreddit. What I question is the hypothesis.
I'm not an economist, more so an engineer with a serious interest in macro-economy. As such, I have spent time studying the workings of currency for a number of years, and I'm just not getting people who are putting most blame on central banks.
I'm not sure what particular symptom of central banking you have in mind here, but commonly, what people seem to express &amp;ndash; in this subreddit especially &amp;ndash; is that it's some kind of fraud that central banks are inflating the supply of money.
This does not square with my understanding of currency. I literally don't see how a deflationary currency, or one with a fixed, pre-determined supply, would help anyone in the economy.
The global economy is not ruined, as much as it has changed to the detriment of the middle and lower classes in developed countries, and in favor of these classes in developing countries, and in favor of the rich classes everywhere. Factors that make the economy worse for the average person in the US range from freer international trade (which on the other hand is a good thing for humanity), to increase in the number of women in the workforce (which on the other hand is a good thing for women).
The way money is issued is only one of the factors involved, and not necessarily a major factor in "destroying" economies. If anything, central banks may have ameliorated catastrophes that would have been worse with a fixed-supply currency.

"Immigration reform in Japan" translates to "monetary policy cannot fix a demographic problem. Fix the demographic problem."
"Structural changes" may mean anything that directly affects the economy rather than just tweaking the money supply. One of the ideas seems to be a kind of New New Deal, financed by inflation.

In a list that includes "BTC", "BCH", and "SW2X", only one is actually not a debacle. :) It's not the one you suggest. It's the one that's actually usable for transactions, and does not hinge on a .com plan to be usable one day maybe.

Consider that you're asking this question in a censored environment, and I might even receive a ban for saying it. :)
The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency, outside of a bubble, is **not** based on nothing. It is based on mathematics. It is determined by how many people want to make transactions using that currency, and what proportion of the currency everyone needs to make those transactions. The currency can't be worth less, but it can sell for more if people stockpile it for some reason.
With BTC, you currently can't make transactions. Therefore, how much of its value is based on fundamentals? ;)

BCH does not need to implement a whole lot, because *it works as-is*. Meanwhile BTC is betting the farm on something that does not exist yet.

BTC: 


[2017 Cambridge study]( "58% of mining pools with greater than 1% of the total bitcoin hash rate are based in China, followed by the US with 16%"


Irrelevant when anyone can run a validating node for themselves. That's the *idea* of a peer-to-peer currency.
For BTC, running a validating node requires a PC. For BCH, it requires a PC as well. Not that different.
Now, let me return the favor :)
- BTC in its current form is not a useful medium for transactions at all (currently $40 per small transaction; a couple weeks ago I paid $200 for a larger one). Talk of centralization becomes meaningless when the network is *not fit for purpose*.
- Future viability of BTC is based on a pipe dream. (We'll have LN, and it will be decentralized! In development since 2015!)
- In reality, there will likely be LN (eventually), but it won't be decentralized. That would require solving an NP-hard problem.
Instead, if LN is going to exist, it's going to be a mesh of smaller central authorities.
In that case, yes, LN can work. What payment network already exists as a mesh of central authorities? Visa!
But what does Visa have that LN doesn't? Currencies with stable exchange rates... :)

One of the largest groups of early Bitcoin adopters seem to be people who believe that people who are "foolish" or "stupid" should "get what they deserve" (lose your savings / get ripped off).
Bitcoin is an unforgiving currency (hard drive died? tough luck! got hacked? tough luck!) that fits in well with an unforgiving audience (people who don't want to be mommied).
It so happens that these people are a minority, though. Which, in its current incarnation, puts limits on Bitcoin's success. It *has* to be made more forgiving to be more widely adopted.
But lack of forgiveness - the utter undoability of mistakes - is built into the innermost core of the currency.

I got both goxxed and BFL-ed, yet wouldn't call myself foolish or stupid.
I overestimated the risks of storing BTC myself (how to not lose BTC due to equipment failure, how can I trust free wallet software like Armory? I'm still not sure that I can), and underestimated the risks of keeping them with a company which at the time held 5% of the world's BTC (someone storing that much ought to store it safely?).
I overestimated the rationality and self-interest of my counter-parties. If Karpeles knew what's good for him, surely he wouldn't (1) fail to protect the ginormous amount of BTC he was storing from external threats, or (2) sabotage his future by stealing it himself. If the BFL people knew what was good for them, surely they wouldn't be egregiously defrauding customers *while operating from Kansas*. What did they expect, no attention from the Feds? LoL.
So I lost a fair bit, mostly because I was only able to get a handful of BTC out of MtGox before it collapsed. But it's nothing I can't get over, and I lost comparatively little compared to the idiots who pulled off these stunts. Would I want to trade places with Karpeles, or one of the BFL people, even if they did get away with a lot of BTC? Hell no. Even if they get away with it, being an eternal fugitive, what kind of life is that?

The history doesn't matter, agreement about the current state of transaction outputs matters. If you agree with that, then how the state was arrived at is irrelevant.
If we agree that I have $100 and you have $300, the sequence of transactions that led to our having these amounts is irrelevant for most purposes. Historians care, but for historians, there can be separate archives.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:40:19
No... Why do you still not seem to understand?
There *is* no concept of correctness outside of consensus. That which has consensus is correct.
If consensus is that origin block is 358080, with transaction state as it was known at that time (include in the consensus a hash over an encoding of the transaction state), then that is the God-given truth.
If consensus is that origin block is 0; even though there were transactions in the early blocks that took place incorrectly; then that is also the God-given truth, and those transactions are correct.
It's not just that correctness does not matter. It's that there is no concept of correctness outside of consensus. If consensus says an apparently invalid transaction was valid, then it is valid. Consensus is God.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:45:02


More or less. It is a set of rules that a majority of users and miners follow. Minorities that disagree are coerced into accepting the majority's rules, unless they want to run a fork of their own. Stubborn minorities can still exert pressure, because the majority would also like to avoid a fork.


That is *exactly* what it is. Almost all new users are likely to adopt whatever the majority has chosen. If you want to operate within the system, you have to choose what the majority does.


The historical verifications you prefer are *not* consensus. They can be used to *build* consensus. They are effective at building consensus if you want to include in that consensus people who care about such verifications.
Such people, including probably yourself, are a subset of users and miners. They are not necessarily the most rational subset of users and miners. They are probably not even a majority of users and miners.
This preoccupation with *verifying* history, rather than *agreeing on* history, could be compared to OCD, and is most likely a minority position which most prospective users and/or miners do not care about.

Thanks for the tip. I did read the article. However, now I looked at the Factom whitepaper as well.
Looks like they don't just use "blockchain technology". There's no independent blockchain. They actually piggyback on the Bitcoin blockchain for what looks like an essential notary service.
If lots of people start to do this, this may create "interesting" incentives for Bitcoin mining...
@_date: 2015-05-16 02:22:18
It looks like they're going to make a custom blockchain. In order for this to work:
* Someone has to be motivated to mine it. How? Grant land ownership per block mined? Pay money? What kind of money? Who pays? If it's a centralized agency, what's the point?
* Legitimate miners have to invest enough resources into mining to withstand 50% attack. Just how many resources are that, if we're talking about *titles to land*?
It seems to me that the incentive for legitimate miners is bound to be too small, and the incentive for illegitimate miners is bound to be too large.
Unless they figure out something genius. *shrug* They need some kind of incentive breakthrough, but that's not evident from the article.
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:44:18
It seems your reasoning is based on the faulty premise that Bitcoin as-is allows you to definitely exclude the possibility that you're looking at an incorrect transaction history. But this is not the case. The state you currently trust can always be invalidated by information you don't have.
For example, it could turn out that a super strong attacker, e.g. some kind of national security agency, invested into a super-strong ASIC mining farm, and that they by now have a secret main chain that's much stronger (in terms of proof of work) than what we perceive to be the main chain. They can publish that main chain any day now, and it will render thousands of recent blocks invalid.
Bitcoin doesn't provide you with *definite* truth about the state of transactions. It just provides you with *probable* truth that is the best you have, for all you know. If someone keeps you in the dark about what else is happening out there, you may well be working based on incorrect transaction history, and do not know.
For the same reason, hard coding a database of pruned transaction history into some future version of the client is good enough, because it's "probably correct, for all you know". It's another state that you believe to be correct, but could be invalidated with information you don't have. But that is the most assurance Bitcoin can ever give you.
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:06:05
That is pretty much completely false.
What makes a given bitcoin valid is majority consensus. The choice of origin block, and its contents, are arbitrary.
One of the current latest blocks is this one:
We could tomorrow all switch to an implementation that uses this block as origin, prune all earlier transactions whose outputs have been consumed, and never ever remember them any longer. The protocol would continue to work, and be just as strong.

What would be the purpose of banning a product if anyone can still sell it, as well as facilitate such sale, as long as they put a warning on it saying "buyer beware"?
Penalties for sellers, and those who facilitate sale, are how you impose a ban. Putting sellers and sale-facilitators in prison *is* how people are told we're not kidding when we say the product is unsafe.
In the case of drugs, it's also arguably much preferable from a standpoint of civil rights, and our ability to help addicted users, than criminalizing possession.
But if you ban neither sale, nor possession, then you have no ban at all.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:31:41


The entire point of this was to knowingly, intentionally facilitate the sale of banned products. He didn't "just" set up a market in good faith with respect to the law. He set it up in *bad* faith, so that prohibited products could be sold.
By doing so, in the eyes of the law, he accepted responsibility for consequences that the ban is intended to prevent.


Would you make this statement if we were talking about millions of parents whose children died because of an unsafe product? A product that is known to be defective and cause death? A product that is banned for this reason?
You disagree with the drug policy itself, and this is reasonable, because the drug policy is relatively unreasonable. But as long as this drug policy exists, and is the way it is, the sentence given to Ulbricht makes a *ton* of sense.

Well - since I would have *not* sold the Bitcoins even if they were not stolen, and would in fact still be holding them long term, like I intended to begin with, at least *in my case* he is technically correct.
He is, of course, technically mistaken for those who would have sold in the meanwhile. And yes, even if they returned them now, they removed from me the *option* to sell.
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:54:53


But this interpretation of morality is the very cornerstone of the anti-drug policy under which Ulbricht was sentenced. According to this interpretation, the drug is a product. The product is purported to have ill side effects in excess of useful side effects. Whether or not this is actually true is debatable, but the product is banned because of these perceived properties. Therefore, whoever sells the product *despite the ban* is responsible for the ill side effects.
It's the same logic that would be used against you if you knowingly sold defective Christmas lights that you know have failed inspection and will cause fires, for instance. Especially if they're already banned, and you know it.

Instead of looking at the full transaction history, you can look at a pruned transaction history, which at some point everyone agreed was authentic. The authenticity of that state is testified to by the fact that it's hardcoded into your Bitcoin client v123.4.5.
Presumably, if there were issues with the authenticity of the pruning, that client wouldn't have been adopted widely.

Brandishing black and white absolutes like this will help you none in understanding a nuanced reality.
As long as the exchange rate of a currency is stable, it doesn't matter what it is. The exchange rate isn't affecting anyone's wealth if it isn't moving.
What you're arguing, then, is in favor of an *appreciating* currency. That could be argued to be beneficial for the country, as you describe, as long as the appreciation is consistent, predictable, and based on solid fundamentals. If the fundamentals aren't solid, things will look wonderful for maybe a decade, followed by disaster. See Icelandic Krona 2008, British Pound 1992.
But this recent 30% jump in the CHF/EUR exchange rate is neither consistent, nor predictable. Chances are that things will stabilize in the long run, but a jump like this is an economic catastrophe. What you describe summarily as "cheap/better labor abroad" actually means high rates of unemployment at home, which means tremendous pain for many people until the economy restructures. Business plans that made sense based on the prior exchange rate are now out the window, and the people they employed may not find work anywhere else. If the exchange rate remains jumpy, that introduces uncertainty that prevents new investment.
You are making the argument that a 30% jump in exchange rate is good for anyone other than speculators - the ones that happened to make the right bet. No, it's economically disastrous.

A vibrant economy is driven by spending, which is financed with disposable incomes. Under a deflationary currency, people will keep buying essentials, but will significantly reduce their enjoyment of luxuries. They will also buy cheaper, thriftier essentials.
This removes demand from the economy, removing jobs other than those involved in the production of things actually being purchased, i.e. only the most essential things. If you want an economy in which you can survive, and survive only, but enjoy very few other things, this would be it. Though possibly you can't even survive if your income depends on something other than producing an essential item.

I'm sorry, but &amp; it saddens me how invested you are into the illusion of separateness.


Well, let's see.
I fundamentally disagree with the "war on drugs", which is in fact a war on (especially particular) people.
I disagree with bellicose foreign policy. The US military is invaluable &amp; the US is the only country strong enough to stand up to Russia and China &amp; but invading Iraq was done on false pretenses, and was obviously unnecessary.
Israel has too much lobbying power, and meddles with US politics. People who just happen to be Jewish control 90% of the media, and decide who has a chance to get elected. This distorts foreign policy and allies the US closely with an oppressive regime with very questionable policies.
I am against mass surveillance. I think it's questionable short-term gain for long-term loss. The US is the economic power it is because it's been the country of aspiration. Smart, productive, ethical people have historically wanted to move there. These incentives are reduced when the country engages in blatantly unethical activities. Its whole international standing suffers. And for what benefit? Unethical behavior is a losing strategy; a fool's one.
I find it abhorrent how the US, as a society, does nothing to help people who, for one reason or another, are stuck with mouths full of rotting and decaying teeth, and are being asked by the wonderful, free-as-in-liberty private care system anywhere upwards of $7,000 to fix them. We don't help with that until they enter the ER when their infections have entered their bloodstream. At that point, they're about to die, and we end up paying more than we'd have had to pay two years before to help them.
Insufficient investment is being done into maintaining existing infrastructure. A belief in private enterprise at any cost prevents abominations like Comcast from being reined in.
Industries that are strong in their states are able to ally with their state governments to pass absolutely horrible bills, like ag-gag bills and the banning of local regulation of fracking.
Public worker unions; and police unions especially; appear to be doing a fair amount of evil. Serving should be a privilege, not a right. Unions of public employees should most likely be prohibited. These workers are already being represented toward their employer as voters. Especially when it comes to police, they really don't need additional entrenchment and guarantees.
But *none* of this means that the solution lies outside of the system. The US is far from having a system so dysfunctional as you want to believe. For the most part &amp; rough edges and all &amp; the system in the US *works*.
Truly, you have no idea what it's like in *actually* dysfunctional countries, or what's a *truly* oppressive regime.
Your country gives you the freedom to be a couch warrior with these edgy opinions; and what you'd like to do with that freedom is destroy the country, and replace it with something a lot more like Somalia, instead.
You should try living in a country where everyone evades taxes. See what that's like.

There's nothing unsustainable about growing GDP. Growing GDP is increasing our ability to make things happen. There is no requirement to poison the environment in which we live as part of higher GDP. Once we've poisoned the environment already, lowering GDP also reduces our ability to take any corrective actions. The Sun creates 10^13 times more energy than we use. We are not even close to unsustainability.
A deflationary currency discourages transactions same way as a ubiquitous lack of trust. Only essential transactions happen, creating a vicious cycle that leads to economic misery.
To see places like that, travel to Nicaragua or anywhere else with GDP around $2,000 per capita. Live there for a while and see how transactions don't happen, and what the quality of life is.

You don't face prison for disagreeing. You face prison for taking actions that are unlawful. In the case of taxation, this is participating in economic activity without following the protocols, such as reporting and paying taxes, that have been put in place for everyone to follow.
The justification for society to require such protocols is that, what seems at first glance a small scale activity, gives rise to emergent large-scale phenomena in aggregate. By enacting protocols having to do with reporting and taxation, we are attempting to coordinate emergent phenomena that are desirable, and to nip in the bud phenomena that aren't.
You aren't being forced to do anything, specifically. However, if you do *something*, your actions eventually impact everyone in some small way. Therefore, if you do *something*, you are expected to do it in a particular manner.
This means that if you work, or if you trade -&gt; you report, and pay taxes.
There's much argument to be had about whether particular reporting rules and taxation strategies actually result in desirable outcomes. However, our ability, as a community, to put rules in place, is fundamental.

People in China save on a large scale, and it's a huge economic problem.
Saving is the rational thing for *individuals* to do when they don't have a social safety net and their future is uncertain. The only way to save is if there is a functioning economy in which other people are spending, though. 
The economy as a whole cannot save, because it has nowhere to put the savings. Money, whether BTC or fiat or gold, is an *illusion* of value. Real value is being able to trade these credits, which are mostly without intrinsic value, for real goods. The only way you can do that is if those goods are being produced, and then only to the extent they are being produced.
Society can't save because there's no economical way to have a static store of potatoes, or whatever have you, for 50 years down the road. The best society can do is develop and maintain systems that will produce those goods 50 years down the road. But the best way to have such systems in 50 years is to use them, which is done by people spending.
If everyone saves, the economy's production capacity withers, and the money is also worth less because there's not as much you can buy with it. Trying to "save" at the level of an economy is a death spiral.
The economy runs best if no one saves. This is greatly facilitated by social safety nets being strong enough that there isn't incentive to save, to begin with.

When you are using these things to justify taking away people's rights over what they do with their bodies, the burden is on you to show that a substantial proportion of sex work is this way; and that the best solution is to make sex work illegal.
Australia and Europe seem to do well with sex work legalized. Reasonable legal frameworks provide a safe environment for workers, while keeping health risks under control.

I should add to this that yes, price controls don't work. But it's important to understand *why* they don't work, and not to confuse this with *oh my, we can't control anything*.
Naive price controls fail because they are ham-fisted. They're as subtle as a sledgehammer, and distort incentives in bad ways.
This doesn't mean, however, that freely emerging market incentives, with no imposed structure, are what we want. If that were *really* what we wanted, we wouldn't be trying to fix something with price controls, would we.
It also doesn't mean that there isn't a proper way to influence incentives; which does, however, require a lot more thought than putting a hard and fast price limit on something.
The decoupling you read about is not ham-fisted price control. It functions differently, and structures incentives better.
Much of the failure of government in economics is that policy originates with people who are economically inept. This results in bad interventions, which results in lack of faith that we can make *any* interventions.
You are currently residing in this lack of faith, which in its nature is very similar to popular distrust of GMOs in food, or people emphasizing "organics". It comes out of distrust and limited understanding, bolstered by this naive idea of how all we need to do is just let nature do its course, and not interfere.

Adult human interaction cannot be completely voluntary as long as adult humans can create children.
You can have a completely libertarian state as long as all the adults who comprise it come from somewhere else, and accept sterilization (permanent, or at least as long as they remain in that state).
As soon as you have reproduction, questions arise about the kids:
- What are the kids' rights? Do they have any? If not, they're coerced.
- If the kids' parents violate the kids' rights, how, and by whom, are those rights going to be enforced?
- When the kids grow up, how do they have equal opportunity when all the property is already distributed?
You need a government to answer and step in for each of these questions. If you don't have that, then the state is not libertarian (the kids are being coerced). But if you have that, then the state is also not libertarian (adults are being coerced).
You can have libertarianism in a closed system of adult immortals that join voluntarily and don't reproduce. Otherwise, not.

If the bigger party has equal choice in what arbitrators they're willing to deal with, arbitrage overwhelmingly favors the bigger party, because the bigger party controls much more of the business brought to the arbitrator than the smaller party.
Allowing large businesses to dictate terms of dispute resolution effectively prevents class action lawsuits, which are an important way to hold large businesses accountable over systemic abuse.
Arbitrage can work for equally powerful parties. But that's the only situation where it works.


As the small party, you have no choice. You either go with the corrupt arbitrators chosen by the large corporations, where decisions always favor the large corporations; or you don't get service. If there are any payouts, they are such that it doesn't hurt the corporation at all, and they can proceed with systemic abuse because paying out some small amounts from time to time is cheaper.
You either get to agree to use their courts, or you don't get service. Good luck.

He was a corporate takeover specialist in the 1980s, who was prosecuted and found guilty for, essentially, representing himself in court in an arrogant way. He was convinced the case against him was ridiculous and petty, and it was prosecuted by none other than Rudy Giuliani, who was in the process of scoring political points. In prison, he became a self-taught lawyer, and for decades after, he's been fighting the US trying to seize the assets he had earned.
It's not correct to say he "hates the government". Rather, he has experience of governments as they actually are &amp;ndash; old boys' networks, where the rules work differently whether you're inside or outside the club.
He happened to make enemies with boys inside the club, and has been paying for it. As a person, he's extremely well-read, and has an undying work ethic (so much so, it can be considered a fault). As far as I can tell, his political views seem to be reasonable and centrist, and do not involve nonsense such as "there should not be a government, at all".
Socialist-leaning people might despise him for his role in breaking up large corporations that employed thousands. From a different perspective, these corporations were being run by entrenched, grandiose, politically connected managers who were acting against the interests of shareholders, and whose mismanagement was a main cause of [stagflation](
Since then, in my opinion, optimization of corporate efficiency has gone overboard, and too far into the "shareholders above everything" side of the spectrum. However, when Paul was active, there is reason to believe his role was contributory, and needed.

Again, you are intentionally blind to that I thought about these things 15 years ago. You somehow labor under the delusion that you can present me with "stunning new ideas" that I have not yet considered. Except that you're a noob, and you're presenting me with all the same ideas that I *also* adopted for a number of years, and then discarded.
What part of "I have been through this" do you not understand? This is why I'm arrogant to you. Because you must be a moron to expect that I'll be persuaded by an argument that I have *already* explicitly stated that I've considered, in-depth, 15 years ago!
That being said, if I claim that I've considered this, then I must have a counter-argument. Here it is.
Imagine that, instead of me coming to your door with 20 friends and asking you to pay taxes; instead of that, you have a nice libertarian town going on, where you have established absolute property laws with your 20 friends. There's no taxation, and everything is voluntary. If you guys can't all agree on some common project, it's just not done. Since 20 people never agree, this means not much gets done that cannot be done with the consent of only a few people. However, this suits you fine, since your top goal in life is absolute liberty, "don't tread on me"; *not actual well-being*.
Now imagine that, among your 20 friends, one of them falls on bad fortune. He makes some mistakes, he has some bad luck, a sinkhole opens under his house, he gets sick and cannot maintain his property; whatever. Suppose he has a family, a wife and several children. By the time the children are teenagers, the man and the wife have an accident, and they perish. The estate is taken by the parents' debt, and their surviving children have nothing.
Now, it so happens that you and your remaining 19 friends own all the property. You own all the water sources, all the land, all the cattle, all the forest, all the food. You established absolute property rights, so all trespassers are shot on sight. For the orphaned children, there's nowhere to go. There might be other towns, but they are far, and those other towns might be no friendlier.
What, do you imagine, happens?
Suppose some of these children are employable, and they are lucky enough to get jobs shoveling shit in your stables. If they make sure to not get in trouble, they will be able to earn a living licking the boots of your sons.
But this couple had several children. A couple were healthy, but another lost his leg to amputation because the family could not afford medicine. The youngest child is autistic. He's insufferable, extremely difficult to deal with. He has temper tantrums, he shits on people's carpets in their livings rooms, he attacks people when he feels threatened.
What happens to them?

Consider that the crime in question might be embezzlement; the accused may in fact be guilty; and prosecution being able to freeze their assets would prevent them from destroying those assets, or funneling them somewhere beyond recovery.
It seems evident that there are cases where the responsible thing to do is to freeze the assets. But then again, a defendant should be able to pay for their defense. *But then again*, should a guilty defendant be able to pay for their defense using embezzled money?
For example, suppose Karpeles stole MtGox Bitcoins. Do you want him to be able to pay for a superstar legal team with those same stolen Bitcoins? 
It seems the best system might be some sort of insurance which allows the assets to be frozen, *but* if the defendant is found innocent, the insurance pays them back *all* losses due to freezing. The costs of such insurance would have to be paid by the prosecution, which could then make a sensible decision about what proportion of assets to freeze, in order to minimize damage (and their costs) if the defendant turns out to be innocent.

You would like to undermine the very vehicle that people use to reconcile their different wants.


It is not *just* about stupidity. It is about being informed. The government enforcing standards allows people to have reasonable expectations about safety of products they are buying. You seem to have no comprehension about how much of an efficiency improvement it is that, when you walk into a store, you don't expect to be defrauded. When you buy rice, you do not have to check if it's fake race (extruded potatoes covered in plastic). When you buy milk, that it's not actually "enriched" with poison.


While there are people who do petty malicious things, just for the sake of doing them, this is not the source of the greatest evils. The greatest evils aren't meant to be evil &amp; they're just the outcomes of selfishness and ignorance. The evils that arise from people doing "whatever they want" with their property are emergent properties of the system that need to be mitigated systematically. For the most part, these evils do not arise due to individuals *wanting* to be evil.


I'm not sure what reasonable person believes such a thing.


Having no experience of life in third-world countries, you do not recognize that the vast majority of the wealth you enjoy is not, in fact, of your creation. The wealth you enjoy is an emergent property of the system you are in, and does not exist without the system.
The concept of property that you cherish is only made possible *by* the system, and is one of the parameters of the system. Changing the parameters of the system is not theft, because theft only exists within the system.
Outside of the system, you have no property. Outside of the system, everything just is, and is held by whoever takes it. You are trying to both benefit from the system (enjoy property rights), and not be part of the system. This is hypocrisy.
If you want property rights, you need to agree to how we define them. Our definition of property rights includes taxation. If you don't agree with how we define property, you are outside of the system. Outside of the system, you *have* no rights.


Those things are foolish to believe, and reasonable people do not believe them.


That's another strawman of which you have convinced yourself.
You are not making a good-faith attempt to understand what the other party *actually* thinks. You're projecting your ignorance.

If there was an insurance payout for being found innocent, you could get a lawyer on contingency, with a multiple of legal expenses covered by the insurance payout if your defense succeeds. It has to be a multiple, so that if the lawyer defends people like this often, the payout covers the lost cases, too.
This would promote strong defense for folks who are perceived to have a high chance of being innocent, while discouraging wasting resources on folks who are likely guilty.

I wish I could track down the analysis of arbitrage decisions which pointed out very clearly that 99% of all large business vs. individual arbitrage decisions, over a period of years, were in favor of the corporation.
99%. Literally only dozens of decisions among tens of thousands were made in favor of the individual.
Think about that.
Your Apple example completely misses the point, and shows you lack understanding of power dynamics.


Do you regularly negotiate special terms when you, as an individual, use any kind of mass market product?
You do not. You do not get special terms as an individual, because you do not have negotiating power.
You would have negotiating power if you could bargain as a group. But wait! You're putting policies in place that *prevent* you from bargaining as a group.
All mass market stuff is available on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. If you want internet, your choice will be Comcast or Verizon. Both will mandate use of the same arbitrage association for disputes. You can either agree to that, or hey &amp; no internet!
Consider not just buying stuff. Consider employment. You want to work for ACME Corporation? Employment agreement requires this arbitrage association. Oh, you think that arbitrage association is unfair? OK, no job for you.

Why are you arguing this? The only explanation I can conceive is that you think I'm a communist in favor of abolishing property and trade.
I am in favor of property. I am in favor of trade. *And* I am in favor of harnessing markets so as to produce socially desirable outcomes.
You're the one who thinks (1) markets can even *exist* without some kind of structure; and that (2) the best structure for markets to exist in is un-designed and naive. You're the one who thinks that markets automatically produce the most desirable outcomes under some "self-evident" structure. You're the one who pays no thought to assumptions of how market structure is created and provided.
For some reason you seem to think I am the opposite type of maniac who labors under the delusion that money is bad, or that markets need to be abolished.
I don't have those beliefs. I'm pointing out that you, the fundamentalist pro-market maniac; and Commie Marxson, the fundamentalist anti-market maniac; are in fact two sides of the same coin. And more alike than you think.

It's written from a perspective, and with information, that might offer you a different angle, if you are open to it.
I used to identify as libertarian, and pursue the ideas that you seem to be pursuing, until I realized that despite years of trying, I cannot reconcile facts with theory. The facts seem to be that, not only is government necessary, but *good* government is necessary; and there is no silver bullet. Good government requires our vigilance and effort. It is like all systems, in that it always wants to fall apart unless good and underrated people constantly work to keep it steady.

This lesson is much easier to learn in successful Western environments, though, than it is in dog-eat-dog environments. Russia is a dog-eat-dog environment. The poorest neighborhoods in developed countries are more likely to be dog-eat-dog environments.
In those environments, you learn the counter-productive lesson that other people are not to be trusted, you have to watch your back at all times, and the only way to get ahead is to stab other people in the back when they are not watching. This is counter-productive because this is not actually the best way to get ahead in life. The best way is to get *out* of the dog-eat-dog environment, get *into* a successful environment, and then succeed *with* people rather than against them. That way, you succeed bigger, and most other people have your back, instead of you having to watch it.
But I'm not sure Russia is a good place to learn that.

No, the comment you were replying to is correct. A seasoned C++ developer who codes well, speaks English well, and knows what they're doing, is paid $100k+ per year. Doesn't matter if in the US or in Italy.
If your friends make 1200 EUR per month as programmers, they must be doing something much less demanding and critical than GPG. For every excellent developer that earns $100+k, there are ten times as many who are second rate, and will make less.
€1200 per month is still very low even for a second rate developer, however. Maybe you mean after tax? That might work out to $30+k per year pre-tax, which might be entry-level pay for people who don't know yet what they're worth (or the Waldos who know... and it serves them better if no one finds out).

It was an analysis of *private* arbitrage.


You are a network maintenance professional laboring under the delusion that monopolies are formed 100% by government, and 0% by market dynamics. You seem to think what it would take to de-throne a monopoly like Comcast is deregulation. You don't recognize that a market can be structured in such a way as to naturally discourage entry, and to protect the incumbent.
Under complete regulatory freedom, the only effective way to compete with an infrastructural monopoly like Comcast would be to compete with them at their full size and scope, which means investing hundreds of billions of USD to build out a network matching theirs, going to the same households, duplicating infrastructural investment. This is the *only* way you can compete with them without government protection; without them being able to improve service and drop prices in just *your* area to drive you out of business.
And if you get to this point, all it gets you is two national providers; which isn't even effective competition. Two providers can easily engage in anti-competitive dynamics and basically agree to split the market, which &amp; oh! &amp; is how Comcast happened. 
And before that, AT&amp;T. And before that, Ma Bell. And before that &amp; in another time and industry &amp; Standard Oil.
You don't seem to know, but you are victim to brainwashing. People who want to weaken the US government so they can gain from their economic position have sold you the idea that government is the cause of all trouble. You've bought this, and now go around touting these convictions that everything would be naturally ideal *if just this oppressive, wasteful government didn't interfere*.
Because *that's* what we see naturally around the world. All of the best countries are those with nearly no government. Right?

Yes, I believe it is. We do not have the luxury of living in a world where everything is optional.
Nature imposes inter-dependencies on us, and we must sort them out, or else. This makes strict libertarianism fundamentally incompatible with the nature of our reality.

Yes, when we all ascend and communicate telepathically. It's the ideal system for something humans aren't at this time.
Right now, though, all you need to see that no kind of anarchy can work with humans is if you log into any mass-multiplayer online game, and compare the performance of a random group without a leader to a random group that has one.
If you've never seen a 40-man premade in Isle of Conquest, I'm not sure you understand how overwhelmingly a group will massacre another just by virtue of having a leader who can tell people what to do, and remove them from the group if it's not done.
The group doesn't have to be individually better than the other. You can have random people on both sides. But the organized group will absolutely massacre the other. Complete control and annihilation without recourse.

The problem is that ancap does not guarantee any rights for the child.
No right to health care. No right to education. No right to be protected from parents' irresponsibility &amp;ndash; including anti-vaxxing.
When kids grow up in ancap, they grow up into a system where all property is already owned. They have only what they inherit, which is little, because most people on balance have nothing. As technology progresses, they increasingly grow up in a system where the owners of property do not need their labor.
How do they feed themselves, when no one has a use for a pair of hands? Especially a pair of hands that's not educated; because the parents could not pay for it, and ancap wouldn't make anyone else pay?
As far as I can tell, the following is 100% okay under ancap:

There is no collection of humans in which you can have 100% agreement for any length of time.

No, I think the people can agree (by voting, like you know, shareholders in a corporation?) how the rules of property will work.
If you're a minority shareholder who thinks dividends should be distributed, but the majority thinks dividends should be re-invested, the majority wins. Same thing for a country. It is not self-evident how property and trade should work. We decide how it works.
The extreme libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) idea is that property rights and rules of trade are not defined by us, but are self-evident or god-given. This is not just plainly stupid, but the economic concepts this ideology assumes are self-serving, and do not work.

The Swedish truck attack killed 4 people, injured 15, and was apparently committed by a "[39-year-old ­Uzbek man]( who "was denied permanent residency status in June and was sought for deportation last summer".
Apparently, he had "shown an interest in Islamic State and has been sympathetic to extremist organizations".
It appears this person was angry and somewhat psychopathic. With his asylum request rejected, he bought into the narrative of an in-group / out-group division where white people are the in-group, and they walk over the out-group, of which he thinks he is part.
The fact that the Middle East is being bombed by white people certainly supports this narrative. Sweden is white. Therefore.
It doesn't have to *make sense*. The fact is that we're helping create an in-group / out-group dynamic. The bombings help create this dynamic, the terror attacks help create this dynamic, and your anger at Muslims helps create this dynamic. It is a vicious cycle.

By your own logic, overthrowing the US as a cartel is not legitimate, because any form of governance can exist within an-cap, and the current form of US governance is what the American people are choosing within the global an-cap.
If you do not permit a republican oligarchy like the US, or a social state like Sweden, or a dictatorial tragedy like North Korea, then you must have rules for what systems you permit inside an-cap. Ironically, you can't enforce those rules, because you have an-cap.
Nearly any individual system inside the an-cap is stronger, and dominates the an-cap. An-cap is absence of system, and any system dominates non-system.
