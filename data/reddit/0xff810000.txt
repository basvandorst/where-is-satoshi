If you use a limit order on GDAX then there is no trade fee. 
You can also deposit USD to GDAX and buy without a fee if you want to wait 3-5 days for the funds to clear before locking in your trade price.

Not sure what the problem is with coinbase. They're not some corrupt rip off scamming company that Reddit likes to make it out to be. 
I've been using them for over 4 years without any issues what so ever. How long have you been using them?

Yeah they no longer credit back the payment used - just apply a credit to your Uber account so that money is already spent.

That's because they were busy accumulating back then and wanted people like your friend to buy in after they were well-positioned.

You can deposit USD first with no fee and then once the deposit clears, submit a maker order and wait for it to fill so you don’t pay any fees. Only taker orders have fees. 
The fee is for the convenience of instant buying. 
You can also do the reverse for selling without paying any fees.

It doesn't exist yet. You could spend the coins again and whichever of the 2 transactions gets confirmed first will invalidate the other.

You sound really butt hurt dude stop whining. If you've got something valuable to say about why eth is a bad idea then state some logic. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:52:54
There's a thriving app market on eth - plenty of reason for it to have value. Sounds like you wish you bought eth.

Yea this guy is just shit posting everywhere. Best to just downvote and ignore.

I'm done. Come back when you actually understand what you're arguing.

My friend was also having bad lag issues yesterday. Is this a common issue with Jaxx? I just started using it and don't want to risk my funds.

That statement won't protect them.
