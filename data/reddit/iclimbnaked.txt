See my edit.
You already arent spending all that money given some of it has to go to things like taxes and your mortgage along with retirement and ivestments. none of which are affected by sales tax.

Yes but when a government ceases to exist you usually have much bigger problems than the fact your government took out loans.
Your currency is going to become worthless either way there. Doesn't matter that the country had debt.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:51:56
Alright bro whatever you say. Regardless youre far from norm.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:40:50


Its simple math. Very simple.
You simply are not paying anywhere near a true rate of 47% of all your income. You can deduct state taxes from federal taxes etc.
Also just because youre in the 25% income bracket does not mean you are actually paying 25% of your money to taxes. Thats leaving out things like the standard deduction and the lower brackets. These duductions mean someone in the 25% bracket effectively only pays like a total of 10-15%% to the feds.

People werent buying those for fear of missing out. They bought those because they offered utility that people wanted.
A lot of the original buyers of bitcoin did so for utillity and belief in the idea, however recently tons of people have bought simply out of FOMO bc price was skyrocketing.

So wait was your property tax on your business or on your house? That makes a big difference.
Only the very high earners who dont at the same time make most of their money from investments actually pay anything near the true 40%
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:34:19
Ive heard their arguments for why its theft, however again ive never heard any practical solution that allows for the same level of life I live now.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:38:54


Thats not at all how that works. 
A 6% sales tax does not just add on given you only pay it on money you spend to buy things. Assuming 30% of your money is going to taxes and say another 20% to savings and say 15% to your mortgage you likely only spend 35% of your money on goods. That means that 6% income becomes effectively a 2% tax.
Also again whats your actual pretax income. You havent told me that number you forced me to guess at it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:24:47
the 30% was my guess at including property tax. Without knowing what your pretax income is its pretty hard to tell for sure.
You didnt really give the best input.
if I assume you actually pay 25% then back doing the math from 80k after taxes (again assuming thats not having deducted retirement savings) youre earning roughly 107k a year.
That puts you at 40% tax rate after property tax.
Now that either puts you as an extreme outlier or your not reporting all your numbers. For someone earning around 100k a year the average actually paid to the feds (including medicaid and social security) is 20%
Also if you are paying 15k a year in property taxes you must own a multi million dollar home even looking at Californias property taxes which if yoru making 100k a year and own a  multi-million dollar home you probably bought too much home for yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:48:36
This is what people miss. A government doesn’t have to worry about death or a time they can’t work. Governments can actually safely take out loans forever. Now there is a limit to how much before it becomes unmanageable but as long as they can pay the payments it’s literally not a problem 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:03:00
Im not saying debt doesn't matter at all, im saying at reasonable levels its not automatically bad for a government. It can be responsible.
While you are right a currency backed by something might stay worth something that also honestly depends. A country collapsing is going to cause a lot of chaos. Your gold backed currency, without its government to enforce that backing, can suddenly not be backed by anything. Doesn't matter that it used to be backed by gold if you cant go cash it in for that gold anymore. You have to hope the institutions in place that provide that backing stay functioning. Thats not a given.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:59:47
I mean a world without taxes sounds pretty damn shitty to me. 
No roads, no police, no millitary. Most jobs would certainly fall apart. Wed be stuck in the days of just being farmers.
Ill gladly pay my part to chip in for the society i had the benefit of growing up in.
Wanting to live in a world that looks anything like today while also arguing taxes are theft is basically arguing you want to be a freeloader.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:16:43
Well sure but if you take that argument I can just buy gold with my fiat (or bitcoin or stock or whatever else). It being backed by gold doesn't make much of a difference in the scenario of you see it coming.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:59:19
Disagree, I pay taxes and i think its 100% fair. I benefited from the society that is largely funded by said taxes. Itd be unfair of me not to pay in.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:53
I mean I agree. My whole point here isnt that debt is always good. Just that debt can be good. Its not objectively bad. It can be used advantageously.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:40:44
Personally I dont agree with the argument that its theft. I disagree. I see the argument I understand its viewpoints but I just disagree.
I think its totally fair to argue about if were paying too much in taxes or if taxes are being allocated correctly. I dont see taxes themselves as a problem though.
If I saw a truly viable option for a no tax system then sure id be all for that because hey no taxes for me. Thats great. Just given again no ones pulled it off, I doubt such a thing exists thats actually viable and doesnt just sound good in theory.
I think if it wasn't for taxes we wouldnt be here having this argument, wed both be working on farms in some small villages.

Maybe I am reading this wrong but they are basically creating a way to log regular currency via blockchain.
IE the currency is still your regular cash just the blockchain will be used to track it in their banking system. Possibly more simply and securely than their current method.
Thats a pretty great idea from the banks perspective. Wont mean much for customers as far as I can tell.

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:45:11
Yah thats absurd. If your whole argument depends on someone believing the argument to make a point then its a pretty weak ideological standpoint.
Point me to an actual plan for society that involves zero taxes and society functioning at the same level it does today and i might be persuaded. Then I would think taxes are a problem.
The fact is without that method, taxes arent a problem because they become necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:56:33
I mean this is pretty easy to figure out. If you know your after tax money whats your before tax income?
Looks like you actually pay roughly 25% but youre a high earner.
Sales tax, gas tax, alcohol tax likely only account for like a 1-3% total effect on your yearly taxes unless you are spending every dollar you earn and not using 401k space at all and not investing or saving.
Capital gains tax is likely lower than your 25% meaning it really lowers your effective tax rate given you get to keep more of the income from that then you would if youd worked a normal job for that money.
So looks like you sit right around that 25-30% area. No where near 47% which was my original point.
Your numbers seem very weird but I admittedly live somewhere with no state income tax, just high sales tax. I make roughly what your after tax income was and only pay like 18% total.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:42:07
I mean I don't see our currency collapsing in the near future either. Nothing about the US financial situation is so far outside the norm to expect a collapse in the near future.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:14:50


Sure but we still had debt in the 50s as well. We were not debt fr
ee. In some ways we may have took on debt to pay out those loans.
Now as far as your objective fact goes, sure you are right but it ignores my whole point. A government that takes on debt can end up with a larger economy than one that doesnt. Leading to more tax revenue as a whole leading to a better overall position.
So yes pure effeciency wise you are right but it ignores the fact that the government that smartly takes on debt can end up with a larger more powerful economy than your hypothetical debt free one. Thus earning more tax dollars and having more jobs.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:58:47
Alright whatever you say.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:24:14


Very debatable. The current 30 year treasury bond pays roughly 2.75% interest. The long term average inflation rate is 3%. So over the course of the loan the governments hardly paying anything really as inflation outpaces their interest payments. This can make taking on debt (if it benefits the economy in the now) very much worth it mathematically. 


Im not  upset about my taxes going to any of those things. I think most peopel are all for their taxes supporting schools an roads. Now there is waste dont get me wrong.


Dont get me wrong here overall I am for reducing the deficit and running a surplus when it makes sense. Im just pointing out that government debt as a whole can make objective mathematical sense. However I do think weve spent a lot of the money were in debt over right now on waste.


Debts fine, needless debt probably isn't. I agree with you that Republicans have long stopped being the party of fiscal responsibility 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:03:42


Does any government in the world do this? I mean If they are running enough of a surplus to have zero debt then id rather they just tax me less in the first place.


This is just objectively false.
Say you can take a loan in the now to make sure you earn more money in the future. This loan is worth it. Governments can do that on long timescales. Now they shouldn't abuse it but during a recession it makes sense for the government to take on debt to stimulate the economy. IE spending more on public works etc. Things like TVA (during the great depression) etc.
There are likely other less extreme examples too. Sometimes it can be efficient to take on debt, ignoring that fact is silly.
Now I think weve definitely taken on too much and needlessly.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:14:07
There are other ideas out there, I wouldnt argue them as better. Given theres literally zero example of any meaningful country having a system that involved zero taxes I wouldn't want to be that Ginny pig.
You can argue if its theft or not all day but ultimately I view it as needed. Ive yet to seen a proposal for an actually viable alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:22
Highly disagree here. It was created to give you an uregulated option. I dont think it was ever intended to become the one and only currency and eliminating banks entirely.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:08:35
Okay some people on here might disagree with me here but if your just managing to save a small amount you should be putting that money into more traditional investments.
Bitcoin is a wonderful piece of tech and I believe in it which is why im invested. But I also know it could disappear tomorrow, another crypto might win or maybe the flaws of bitcoin doom it etc. Its too volatile and uncertain to be someones primary way to gain wealth.
Go to and follow its guides on how to spend money
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:10:02
This is uninformed nonsense (Sorry, not trying to be rude but it gets old hearing this when its just not true). You can go on and buy index funds that track the stock market as a whole for very little money and its a much much safer investment than bitcoin.
Investment sounds scary and hard but in reality a lot of the barriers people imagine are there simply aren't.
I believe in bitcoin and its why im invested but I would never recommend anyone use it as their sole investment route. People should be investing in more traditional investments first.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:20:53
I mean its important to remember that you can lose money putting set amounts every week. Clearly like if youd dumped it all in at the beginning youd have come out ahead. (Again another example of how timing the market is basically impossible).
The best you can do is create a plan and stick to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:23
Again while you are right that is a strategy, we cant know itll recover. You can never know that. Theres always a risk.
If you are uncomfortable with said risk, then pull out. If you arent then keep it.
Theres nothing wrong with re-balancing ones portfolio.
Yes in general think long term not short but everyone has their own risk level they are okay with, its okay to rebalance when too much of you assetts end up in a risky investment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:57:09


[Source showing theyve more or less stayed flat with inflation on average. Its far from the absolute minority.](
Also The average person can definitely buy stocks. You dont need much money at all to invest.
51% of people in America already do own stocks. Its not some minority thing. Plenty of people who dont could but simply haven't researched it. Yes there are people who cant afford to but those are people who cant afford to save at all. Im not saying those people dont exist but those people cant save regardless of if money is inflating or deflating.


No we dont. 


Except thats not true, they increase faster than inflation.


They also dont have cash. Assuming wages keep up (which as ive already sourced they have) with inflation. The inflation cant harm someone living paycheck to paycheck. It only hurts people who have money sitting around.


I have plenty of empathy, im all for raising minimum wage, tying it to inflation. Lots of things could be done to better the wage situation. Corporate greed has been a real issue. Companies are making more and more but not paying their employees more. Thats not an inflation problem. Thats a problem with wages.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:56:12
Alright man. I mean your set in your beliefs and thats fine. Just I dont get why you think the government has reason to be against what your stating if true. If it was true deflation led to stronger economies than governments would want that. They would. Itd mean the money they taxed you would be worth more.
Go study economics, write a paper on your beliefs and go win a Nobel Prize in Economics for solving everyones problems. Itll be easy if what you say is true.
Theres a reason most major economists agree small levels of inflation are good.
Until that time ill lean towards what the leading economists believe and not random guy on the interent making assumptions based on the simple idea of my money losing value sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:57:17
Well I agree but it’s just fact. Most people out there are not rushing to max their 401k. 
Hell I make good money and contribute like 18% before match and I still don’t max it. I’m not going to stretch myself thin to do so now either. I plan to as my salary increases but still. 
Most people do not max a 401k
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:54:06
Eh so the value has to come from somewhere, handing out coins to everyone for free is going to make them worth less. Programming something like this in really makes it fail to work as a currency as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:57:27
Sure but thats a different issue than "trusting the Fed".
However money lenders want high interest rates, it literally makes them more money. Again doesn't make sense from an incentives perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:36:23
That’s fair but people have other goals in life like saving for a downpayment etc. some have student loans to pay off. Others live in places where the cost of living is super high. 
Throw in the fact that the common advice given is you need to save 15% including match to save enough and yah many people aren’t going to bother maxing it out or even think it’s worth it. 
There are plenty of valid reasons to make the decision to put that money elsewhere 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:38:21
Yah and they lower them to increase jobs, not decrease them.
Its not that I dont believe interest rates can't affect jobs, they certainly do. Just in zero ways is unemployment due to manipulation of interest rates or money.

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:15:19
Houses are expensive, if you had to save up for one in full itd often take 20-30 years.
So you can take out a loan and start building equity in yourself by having your mortgage payments basically build value thats yours (the house).
Or you can spend that 20-30 years paying a rich person who owns houses by renting.
Loans make financial sense when used smartly. Loans on a house can be a good idea. Loans on depreciating assets like a tv are moronic.
If you really dont get how a mortgage can be financially beneficial to an individual than I dont know what to tell you, you need to just learn how the world works.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:47
Lol real mature.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:29:11
I mean are you investing in anything hung else? Do you have an emergency fund? There’s a lot of financial things one should do before ever investing in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:34:55


Again theres a reason almost economically speaking deflation is viewed as bad in an economy. You do need to incentivise investment. I guess ultimately it depends how well you can control the deflation which is tough to do. As deflation goes up, reasons to invest go down. Investments have to start beating inflation which depending what it is can be hard to do.


The poor already dont have money to save, if your spending all your money the moment you get it then deflation doesnt affect you. It only affects you if youre saving cash long term. (Now this does mean wages need to keep up with inflation which they havent been, however thats a wage issue not an inflation issue. They arent the same)
Also in what way does it make wealthy people wealthier? You cant really use inflation to your advantage. All you can do is invest in other things.
Im not saying that doesn't affect people at all, it does. Just its not some tax on the majority of the poor seeing as the majority of the poor live paycheck to paycheck.


Tell that to the majority of the consensus of economic thinking out there. You simply dont know what your talking about and running with what seems simple.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:53
I mean they already have once with bitcoin. It lost people fortunes 2 years ago. 
Yes there’s no guarantee it’ll recover which is why when investing in highly volatile things like bitcoin you should only put in what you’re ready to lose entirely. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:55:42
Yah honestly to me its a lot of people who clearly don't know anything about investing. Its honestly a bit scary how many people are diving into bitcoin and clearly know nothing about investing in general.
Like clearly is looking at this like its a get rich quick scheme. Thats trying to time the market which is always a dumb idea. If your going to put money in, put money in you can lose and plan on holding it long term. If it does skyrocket sure you can pull the profit out but you shouldnt be viewing it that way when you go in. Plan on it taking a while to grow.
Turning 160 dollars into 1,600 dollars is worth it even over a like 20 year timespan, thats better than basically any other investment out there.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:08:26
If you refuse to look at real stats then your absurd. Show me actual facts about the average person and ill believe you. Until you do that why on earth should I believe you?
Its like someone showing you the planet is round and you screaming thats not true.
[Source on 52% of people owning stocks (admittedly down from a high of 65%](
You can buy a stock with as little as 20 bucks. Theres nothing stopping people with any amount of money to save from investing other than knowledge of how. Really investing in stock is just as easy as investing in bitcoin these days. You can download an app like robin an buy stocks just as easily as one buys bitcoin on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:35:15
See I think that’s unfair. You can believe the economic thinking of inflation is needed and still want to help poor people. 
I do think inflation is needed in most nations currency but I’m also for things like the UBI and free tuition and free healthcare to help people out of poverty. As they say there’s multiple ways to skin a cat. You can help poor people and never change the currency system. 
Its not immoral to think inflation is needed, thats stretching things too far. You can have an inflationary system and still get people out of poverty. They type of currency you use isnt directly linked to poverty like that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:50:59


Sure which is why common advice is you shouldn't ever invest money you are going to need in the near term. Investment is a long term game. Money you need to spend within 5 years shouldn't be invested (in stocks or bitcoin). Maybe in something super safe like bonds but nothing riskier than that.
You are certainly entitled to your opinion, just the argument that bitcoin is somehow less risky than regular stock market investing is absurd. Yes the stock market may crash tomorrow but its been shown to over the long term return about 10% on average. 
Bitcoin could crash tomorrow and we have no real idea what its average long term returns will be or even if theyll be above zero. 
I believe itll be more than that which is why ive bought bitcoin but I think to even argue its somehow a safer bet than more traditional investment is absurd.

Except as everything i already said showed they arent. They have the same tax benefits, they are still two different types of accounts. Didnt google it, already knew it given I invest in them.


You are the one who got passive aggressive in the first place, you straight up insinuated id lie about what I knew before even giving me a chance to respond. I wouldnt be an ass if you hadnt been one to start with.


Im not. I only contribute to a roth IRA. I also contribute to a roth 401k and a regular 401k.


I dont need the multiple vehicles I have but they offer me different advantages so I choose to have them.  By having money in both roth and traditional it allows me to put away more now than I could if I went 100% roth (as I save some on taxes in the now) and allows me when I retire to withdraw from my traditional first until hitting a taxable income and then withdrawing from roth after. It gives you flexibillity to navigate in retirement. Its not rare for people to be invested in both roth and traditional, nor is it objectively bad. I have the HSA for health expenses, it just works for retirement if I end up not using all the money I save in it.


Just not fact. IRAs are lower than 401ks but traditional vs roth makes zero difference on their contribution limits. Same reason why a roth 401k has the same 18k limit the traditional 401k does. Also if you can be certain you make drastically more now than youll need in retirement, traditional becomes 100% better.


Well unless youve maxed your 401k and still want traditional investment. I havent maxed my 401k yet so thats why I dont invest in a traditional IRA


Your going around saying im a moron for saying they were different when in fact they are different they just offer the same tax advantages. You were the one being pedantic by trying to argue they somehow arent different things despite having totally different contribution limits and being by definition separate types of accounts. Not only that but you started the conversation implying id lie about what I was talking about. Thats just an asshole thing to do and why you got treated like an asshole.

You are the one redefining things, also I am in no way mad. This is to be expected in an unregulated market.
"Insider trading is the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to material nonpublic information about the security."
Not all insider trading even in the stock world is illegal. Its perfectly legal for say directors of a company to buy shares of their own company despite having insider knowledge. This is still called insider trading however. [Investopedia describes the several legal insider trading situations that happen all the time](
Yes the term usually implies illegallity, that doesn't mean it universally is used that way.
I agree with you there was no crime here, and this is the price for having an unregulated market. I agree with you on all of that. That said it still is 100% insider trading. They traded knowing information the public didnt. Thats 100% the definition of insider trading.

How on earth does inflation increase debt? It actually makes your old debt shrink. IE if I get a loan for say 10k dollars and agree to pay it off in 30 years. That 10k is worth way less 30 years from now. I gained value from getting it in the now and paying it off later.

Umm. Even that’s something you have to be prepared to lose. Man I’m shocked by people’s lack of investment knowledge on here. IRAs don’t have any guaranteed returns. You choose how to invest them. You can invest it all in highly volatile stocks I you want or super conservative bonds. 
Any investment you have to be prepared to watch it go down. They all do occasionally. Some never recover. That’s true of bitcoin and it’s true of your ira investment choices. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:12


Except you are literally arguing this with people who are saying the oppisite like myself. Im saying this is legal but its still insider trading. Pick the fight with people who are actually doing what your upset about and calling for legal action. Dont pick the fight with people who agree with you.


I wouldn't say this situation is comparable here. I get why you made this point and I think theres an argument to be had but I think its stretching things. Insider trading is still commonly used to refer to legal acts as well, just not as much so in the public space. 


They had insider knowledge of what their big player company was going to do and knew itd affect the market.  Sure its debatable of if thats technically insider trading or not. Insider trading doesnt have to be stocks of a company your knowledge pertains to, itd be insider trading if you knew you were about to go bankrupt and bought a bunch of stocks in your competitor.
The key to insider trading is having knowledge thats not available to the public, thats what happened here. I will admit theres probably a technical point to the definition that may negate it as being truly insider trading given bitcoin itself isnt a company. That said I do believe insider trading happens on commodities of which bitcoin basically is.

Well it has me on track to retire by my mid 40s. So yes ill call it pretty quality. The stock market as a whole is pretty much the easiest way to gain wealth. Its just slow and boring. Its exactly what most rich people use as well to keep wealth. Personally id much rather have my 401k than deal with a company pension. Companies screw those up all the time and fail to pay out.
There arent many better investment options outside of privately investing in new companies yourself but thats hugely risky and basically becomes its own job.

I don't blindly trust the fed. However its in the best interest of the government to have as many people employed as possible. It increases income from taxes and decreases welfare payouts.
Theres no reason for them to increase unemployment or manufacture it if it doesn't need to exist.
I believe in incentives and I dont see an incentive for the government to want unemployment. Also theres zero countries out there with 100% employment so the argument really doesnt make sense at all.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:54:48
Thats skewing his point. 
An emergency fund in the scheme of things isn't a ton of money, savings are going to be used in the near term so also not really affected by inflation much.
Anything long term should ideally be invested. Money was never designed to be an asset you hold. If everyone did itd be disastrous to an economy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:41:05


You use money but you spend it when you get it. You cant let it sit to gain or lose value. In a deflationary economy your wages are going to start going down because they pay you based on what your worth. Youd be worth less as an employee so they can pay you less.


Loans for certain things are great ideas. Not a strange economic idea at all.
I didnt say everyone can get them, I said everyone who hasnt ruined their credit and have a job can get them. Thats basically true.


Lets just break this down.


This I agree with. Thats true.


This statement comes out of left field. Proof on this? Sure I guess as loans became easier to get it meant people could buy higher valued homes which would factor into prices going up. However to argue thats the sole reason is a bit farfetched. Like I already said if you want to move out into rural no where houses are cheap. House values have skyrocketed in part also because everyone has moved to cities and your competing for property.


You say this like its fact, you point to its because governments have so much debt. You ignore the fact that if deflationary economies would boom that they could get more income that way. Itd be worth switching for them. Yes their debt would increase in value but suddenly the taxes they are taking from you are worth more. Thatd be good for them as they have an unlimited time horizon un like people who die.


Your ignoring what I actually said. I never said everyone could. I said everyone could who didnt already ruin their credit and have a job.
Homeless people rarely fit both those categories. 
If you think home prices are why people are homeless you need to go talk to some homless people. Most have trouble getting a job, its not the price of homes that screwed them. Its their lack of jobs, or their lack of skills, or mental illness, or other things that have failed them.
The homelessness issue is a real problem, however inflation isnt whats causing it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:52:01


We have no idea if its just starting or if its going to plummet tomorrow.
The reason youd sell is if you decide you want to take your profits now and not deal with the risk going forward. You might lose out on future profits, but you no longer risk future losses either. Its a personal choice.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:31:03
Okay. You’re just a typical conspiracy nut where everything the government does is bad and you can’t trust any scientific or statistical research. 


Never said dont question it, but as im about to explain its pretty clear why questioning your reasoning of ask people around you cant be used to decide whats average.
Personal experience matters but it’s pretty damn clear why you can’t use it to generalize. Everyone around you apparently doesn’t have stocks. Everyone around me does. Who’s right? If we both use firsthand experience we come up with different answers. That can’t be factual. Hince why sampling people around you isn’t reliable for making broad generalizations. 
You can literally go download an app called robin hood and buy stocks with low fees. There’s no difference or hurdle that exists for all stocks that doesn’t exist for bitcoin. You simply haven’t researched it. 


Explain what specific regulation is a barrier for you? This sounds like generic speak that people just throw around, not a specific actual thing stopping you.


Doesn't apply to all investing.


Knowing that bitcoin is highly volatile and has crashed drastically in the past is one. Knowing the creator of bitcoin controls enough bitcoin to drastically break the market is another. Bitcoin isn't some perfect thing either. Im invested because I believe in it but its not without its flaws too. Same with why Im invested in stocks, I believe they will continue to rise over time. Its a smart thing to do if you believe that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:13
That’s called trying to time the market. You may win. You may lose. But timing the market is basically gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:45:11
I mean that only works if everyone keeps wanting bitcoin. 
Nothing guarantees that happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:17:01


Just asking people around you is pretty dumb way to gauge the average person. Its an extreme sample bias.
Out of my friends and family though, yes a high percentage own stocks. Anyone with a retirement plan at any company owns stocks. Thats how they work. But yes itd be moronic of me to assume thats the norm just like itd be moronic of you to assume because people around you dont. Thats an extreme sampling bias. Stats do their best to negate those.


You wouldnt expect students to own stocks just like they wouldnt own many assetts in general. Its something you start doing as you get older. I didn't own any as a student. I did know people who did


Explain how you could not. What prevents you from buying stock but lets you buy bitcoin.


Again where did I assume that? Im not saying everyones in my finanical situation. Im pointing to facts of 52% of adult americans own stock.


Yes. Dont see how that relevant?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:12:00
Well yah. That said that same billions of people mostly aren’t going to be able to use bitcoin in any useful way either. Got to have a lot of things to use bitcoin. Things poor people usually don’t have. 
Also I mean if you can’t save as is. Which I admit is true for a lot of people than bitcoin doesn’t help you basically any. It just changes the currency you’re living paycheck to paycheck in. Except now you don’t know what your moneys going to be worth when you have to spend it the next week. 
You can also invest with literally any amount of money these days with apps like Robin. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:14:33
All investing is gambling if you’re trying to time the market. I agree. 
Holding isn’t gambling. That’s not to say you can’t hold and fail. You can. Just a properly diversified investment portfolio with he long term in mind is very safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:50:00
No it doesnt.
Just because it usually is a crime doesnt mean thats tied to its definition.
Inisder trading is literally just trading with inside knowledge. Thats what this was.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:15:32
Duh. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:38


Yes there are people that are doing that. Just you literally responded to people who agree with you that its not illegal and still shaming them for using the term. Thats where I take issue and where everyone else is.


What kinda nonsense is this. Im not denying reality. Im agreeing with you. Just saying its still insider trading, just not illegal insider trading. Thats the only spot we disagree.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:45
You only lose the money if you sell or bitcoin never recovers. If it drops below 6k and you just don’t sell and say in two years it jumps back up then you come out ahead. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:59
Yah its not really a dip, let alone an attractive one if your still up from the day before.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:37:17
I also imagine though with your mutual funds  you aren't looking at them every day. That prevents you from being as crazy about it.
If your in bitcoin for the long term, then stop looking at it every day. Just set it and forget it. Maybe set up an alert if you want to create a stop point at which you will jump out but not sure thats a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:53:51
Its not ridiculous, I mean we all have to fight those urges too. Personally I dumped 1k in a while back and held for quite a long time. At some point i decided to take my original 1k out so now everything i have invested is house money basically. 
Lets me worry about it a lot less.
Starting next year I might start dumping small amounts in each week but well see.
Regardless long story short, you cant time the market. Lots of people think they can but its really just dumb luck. Basically either dump it all in at once or pick set amounts to dump in every week or month etc. Dont pay attention to the price of bitcoin at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:23:02


Which is a good thing. I mean not for you but for the economy as a whole. Theres a reason everyone switched from things like gold backed currency. You need to be able to incentivise investment. Having cash lose value does that.
The government needs inflation, its economically a good thing if kept in check.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:08
Everyone always gets upset with taxes. While I get that and it’s also just normal psychology. Personally I happily pay my taxes. I get a good bit of benefit from the government. Paying taxes is just doing my part. You shouldn’t pay more than you have to but arguing somehow gains on bitcoins shouldn’t be taxed is silly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:53:00
Under what reality is Inisder Trading always illegal. I just pointed you two an article talking about all the legal variations of insider trading.
If you want to make stuff up, go for it. Youve picked a really weird argument to stand on. Youve basically picked fights with people who agree with you that this wasnt illegal but bitching at them for using the term insider trading despite saying this is legal insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:58:57


Lol what. Loans are always neccessary. Even in a deflationary economy people arent born with money for a house to buy. They have to work and earn that money. They may need to buy a house before they can afford to buy it in full.
What kind of absurd line of thinking makes you think loans would suddenly be unneeded.


Yah this shows you have no clue what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:24


Except you dont decide how words get used. Theres not another word for this. Its still insider trading just legal insider trading. Theres nothing dumb with referring to it as insider trading. It should simply be clarified that its not illegal though. Insider trading is used to describe legal things too, are you saying everyone should go out and use a different word for those instances simply because you think its confusing?
You literally replied to a guy stating it was insider trading whether or not it was illegal by saying he was wrong. Hes factually correct 100%. You can argue thats confusing but you cant argue hes wrong.
Then telling me im ignoring reality despite backing up my claim with what the word is defined to mean and you being the one making up rules about it?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:02:18


No they arent, they act basically the same but they arent the same. They are different vehicles. Everyone has a 18k limit to contributions in a 401k but its a 5.5k limit to an ira. You can invest in both for a maximum of 23.5k a year. They function the same from a tax standpoint but they are different. A 401k basically has to be tied to an employer, you cant go open one for yourself(well there are ways if you are self employed). You can with an IRA.


Especially given what I just stated, this is an absurdly pretentious statement. Im not saying this to make fun of you, afterall its admittedly confusing. Just a traditional IRA and a 401k are absolutely not the same thing, they are very similar though.


Im invested in a roth IRA, a traditional 401k, and HSA and a roth 401k. You dont need to tell me. 
Also they arent automatically better. It really depends on your tax situations and what you think your tax rate will be in retirement vs now etc. I invest in both to let me have options in retirement.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:24:30
I think this idea is worth questing. However the safety is still a huge plus to a bank.
Bitcoin does not offer me that safety, if I screw up and lose my bitcoins, theyre gone. Sure there are ways to help prevent that but its not foolproof.
A bank isnt going to lose my money and its insured in the bank.
You can shop around bank wise to avoid most of the fees and your going to have to wait to deposit a check regardless of if your primarily using bitcoin or cash. Well unless someones paying you in bitcoin.
The volatility of bitcoin right now is a major concern as well. Most people cant have the value of their bank account jump around as much as bitcoin does and make it day to day.
I like your points, just a few counters.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:02:08
That’s still taxable. You cashed in on a gain
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:30:55
You can invest with under 100 dollars. Investing is not only for the rich. That’s a giant misconception. Everyone who can buy bitcoin can invest that same amount of money if they want. 
Also slowly transitioning over I would also call someone dumb for. I mean depends how slowly I guess but still. Believing in it doesn’t make it smart. It’s a very highly speculative and highly volatile asset. Investing anything more than you are comfortable seeing go to zero isn’t a great idea yet. 
 Putting anywhere near the majority of ones wealth in it is just way too risky to ever call a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:42:30
Sure. Thing is lots of people in great jobs never bother to really learn what one is. Sounds crazy I know but I work at an engineering firm and no for a fact several engineers I know don’t even bother or just contribute he min for the match. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:45:13


This is an absurdly overly simplified way of looking at it. I agree with you here if you look at that way then awesome its good.
However, follow this line of thinking. If your money is going to be worth 10 times its value in a year, your going to spend way less in the now. Causing the economy as a whole to shrink. This is why its viewed as bad for economies. 
Your 100 dollars might be worth 10X as much but people just lost jobs because everyone was holding their money hoping to have more to spend later.
Not only that but your going to be hoarding that money at the end of the year because it just went up 10 times in a year, if I keep leaving it there ill get absurdly rich. 


Another silly argument, runaway inflation is terrible. Its very very bad.
Small inflation is a sign of a healthy economy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:34


That has much more to do with people moving to cities than anything else.
If you want to move out to the middle of no where say montana a house would also only cost you 3-4 years salary.


Almost everyone can get loans, assuming they dont show they are dumb with loans in the first place and they have a job.


Same way everyone does, working. If you dont have money to save, inflation or deflation doesnt affect you. Youre broke either way.
Man im done. Its clear you dont understand the basics of how the financial world works.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:03:09
Yes it is however i do think bitcoin will stabilize (assuming it doesn't crash) similar to gold where its not deflating at a rate crazy enough to do what your saying.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:56:27


If you are spending all your money as it comes in, inflation pretty much affects you zero.
Inflation only hurts you if you are saving large amounts of cash of which poor people cant. IF you are capable of saving enough cash for it to hurt you, then you have the money to invest and should be.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:50:16


Yah no thats not how that works.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:08


Eh lets be real here. People are buying in mass because they keep seeing it go up and want in on the action. Not many are seeing it and actually researching it and determining what they think its value will be.
Even if so in the now we have no idea which it is. We can't know.


To also be fair here, gold has some true uses that prevent it from going to total zero like for jewelry and electronics etc. Bitcoin does what you say but none of that is unique to bitcoin itself, everything it does any altcoin can do. Hell really currency can do that too. Not as easily as theres many political hurdles sometimes but those could come in the future for bitcoin too.
The things is about bubbles is that hardly anyone realizes something is one before it pops. Theres simply not an easy way to know. This could all come crashing down or it could keep growing.
I think bitcoin will stay useful which is why ive invested, but I also know its a risky investment which is why ive only invested what I dont care to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:48:38
because they both affect value of the transaction going on.
Your still going to have interest on a loan in a deflationary economy. Youll have interest to pay either way.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:51:46


The average middle class person easily has access to quality investment vehicles. Its what everyones 401ks are for and things like IRAs etc.
This idea that investment is only for the rich is absurd and just a common misonception. Over half of americans already own stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:07:45
Yah because they had way less value to begin with. They had to build everything themselves.


That is not a hard logic to follow. Explain how it suddenly wouldnt be true in a deflationary economy
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:17:50
It shouldn’t. It’s just people curve fitting the past. Could it follow for a while longer. Yes. Should it be viewed as gospel. No. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:06:16
Well sure. Which is why people invest etc. 
I’m not saying bitcoin is bad. Obviously it isn’t. I’m invested as well. Just I wouldn’t call it a safe place to keep your value yet. Maybe it will be but right now I’d call anyone who put the majority of their assets in bitcoin a moron. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:58
Goin all in on anything is inherently risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:11
Eh. I mean I’m totally willing to lose the few thousand I’ve dumped into bitcoin. It’ll suck sure but it won’t effect my life at all 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:26
This argument again. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:56
Eh so the value has to come from somewhere, handing out coins to everyone for free is going to make them worth less. Programming something like this in really makes it fail to work as a currency as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:28
I mean sellings not suicide. Could mean locking in profits, just may mean missing out on more. 
Just cant blame anyone for cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:57
Yes but no one can know when that is in either direction.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:33:50
If you gain over 200 dollars from it you do. The thing to not here is the irs treats bitcoin as an asset like gold not like a foreign currency for tax purposes 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:37:50
Well yah but that interest has nothing to do with inflation. Inflation actually offsets that interest over time.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:03:13
If true you hit a major jackpot
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:05:09
I like all these completely made up figures of yours. You can't just assume that the real rate is double the reported. Plus you say Americans Don't read articles. You pulled that out of no where seeing as the study said nothing about that. Maybe that 28 percent prefers reading short articles and that's why they haven't read any books. Don't make shit up.

Congrats on becoming a millionaire.

A better idea would be to probably offer discounts for purchasing in bit coin but if you are willing to take the risk then go for it i guess.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:07:47
I definitely would not take my salary in bitcoin. It's simply way too volatile right now.

Thats true. Your the one trying to be like no you all are arguing its illegal. Youre the one putting words into our mouths.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:42:15


No other one can yet. Theres zero reason it couldnt happen in the future. New talented Devs come around all the time that could work on many a different crypto.


I mean maybe, maybe not. I tend to agree with you but claiming this for sure is tough. Like currently it seems facebook has set itself up in a way that another similar social media site wont be able to replace it. That might not be true though. Its hard to predict with certainty if facebook will be around in 30 years.
Also Etherium is set up to work better at certain things (some argue as a currency as a whole), the devs purposefully designed it to work differently. Theres nothing stopping it or a new currency to come out that does what bitcoin does but better. That said right now Bitcoin works as a better store of value (kinda like gold in the real world).
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:50:55
Said lots of people back in 2013
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:54:48
I agree that it could, just arguing it should is a bit different. To me looking at the thread it mostly seems like data fitting not based on a projection. Id have to read more into it though.
My only point is a lot of people in this sub and in general like to act like Bitcoin is some sure fire thing to be successful. We cant know that. We dont. Were all just taking our best guesses based on the knowledge we have. Bitcoin could be around for a long time successfully or tomorrow it could all fall apart.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:07:42
Possible sure. People shouldnt be arguing its not possible. Guarenteed though is a different issue.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:41:13
I mean I agree. Which is why its more meant as a metaphor.
That said its not like the barrier to switch is that high either. Itd literally just be selling off your bitcoin and buying something else.
I personally think Bitcoin stays around for a long time. I just think arguing its impossible that something doesnt come out of nowhere and overthrow it is a silly argument. Ofcourse that could happen.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:21:17
Eh a ton of people are just in bitcoin to cash out though 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:02:35
I mean is that really a counter?
Anyone could build it. We dont know. Plenty of people design new cryptos all the time and dont control it. 
Im not saying it will crash, im saying it could. I think anyone who legitimately argues bitcoin has zero chance of falling apart simply doesn't know what they are talking about.
Personally I think it succeeds as a store of value like gold but never really takes off as a day to day currency.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:34:48
I mean I guess.
To me during that time period it was everyone used myspace and facebook was more just an odd curiosity.
Regardless Myspace was clearly king just like Bitcoin is now. Theres no reason a better crypto can't come along and take over.
Feels hard to have happen in the now but most people wouldnt have said myspace will be dead in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:36:13
I mean I don't totally disagree but I don't think physical currency is going anywhere for quite a long time. Governments want the ability to control their own currency, and sometimes have valid reason to need to. 
I wouldn't say your wrong, i just think that time-frame is way over a single lifetime if that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:27:44
It does, just a very small minority of the investors are using it for said benefit.
I dunno that itll crash and burn but I would not be at all surprised by a strong correction
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:04:03
Not really.
If that was true a lot more people out there would be making serious money off thigns like this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:56:38
Honestly it going down slowly like that is almost worse. It makes a lot of the people in here saying theyll hold more likely to sell. Its much easier to hold out during a crazy 2 week drop. Much harder to hold out when the price has been dropping for a full year.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:07:42
I mean this is kinda a dumb question.
Its like asking for a loan and being told no because your credit is bad (showing you were terrible with money) but then when they say no saying well I have millions of dollars (well then why were you asking for a loan anyway just buy it full price).
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:55:26
You can do that, just no guarantee the price ever goes back up. It might, it might not. We dont know.
I think it will but nothings a sure bet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:59
I’ve read up a decent bit into bitcoin. I understand how it works. It’s why I’ve invested. I just think arguing it’s guaranteed to be a sure thing is too far. I’d still call someone a moron if they dumped any amount of money they can’t afford to lose in it. It’s way too volatile to do that. 
A competitor can also certainly still overtake bitcoin. Not sure it’s likely but a different crypto can certainly catch on and yank people’s interest away from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:40:19
I mean plenty of people are just seeing it go up in value and are buying just because they see how fast it’s going up in value. 
There’s really no way to know if it’s a bubble or not. The best we can all do is make guesses. Personally I do bet the price drops hard before more gradually rising back up over a longer term. 
I’m certainly investing in bitcoin but I’m only putting in what I’m totally okay with losing which is how everyone should be viewing bitcoin right now. It’s far from a sure fire safe investment yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:29:09
I️ mean Coinbase is insured. So it makes it a bit trickier. 
If you put it in a hardware wallet you lose that insurance so it’s really kinda hard to know what’s actually less risky. Hardware wallets can fail or be lost etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:29:05


Id argue its not but I mean there is an argument to be had there. Just that really opens up a can of worms you could go down on basically anything and everything. Like should factorys have to report emissions, or what they dump in a lake etc.


Not really, i think id argue that both those amendments did make them constitutional. Full stop.
Amendments override the rest of the constitution. IE you could amend the constitution to have a dictatorship and thatd be perfectly constitutional. The constitution didn't put limits on what could or couldnt be amended.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:30:25
Not unless you have 8000 in regular cash ready for if bitcoin crashes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:21:05
Honestly its still in the phase of, dont invest anything you aren't okay with losing.
I can invest in the stockmarket and know atleast long term im extremely unlikely to lose the money. Could it happen especially if I am forced to cash out at a certain point...sure.
That said compared to cryptos right now the stockmarket is wildly safer (Well assuming like index funds)
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:27:46
Man the people crapping on you for this are ridiculous.
This is like investment 101. You should balance your portfolio from time to time. IF going in you said you wanted 10% of your assets to be in bitcoin and a year later 30% of your value is in bitcoin you should re-evaluate.
Are you okay with the additional risk your taking on by not rebalencing or do you rebalence to match your original planned risk level?
You can choose to keep it invested but you have to be aware it is increasing your risk.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:37:06
I agree there. 
I do also think plenty of people overestimate what they feel like they are okay losing when looking at a rapidly increasing asset. 
IE I do think there are people who see bitcoin skyrocket and are thinking yah I need to dump a ton in. They say they’re okay with losing it but also haven’t really put thought into it bc they don’t expect to lose it. 
All that said that’s all on the individual. Outsiders shouldn’t butt in too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:50:49
No but they shouldn't set an allocation once and never re-balance either.

Yah see there was a time when MySpace was the social media king. They werent competing. MySpace looked like they had won. Then little Facebook came around only allowing college kids. It sorta picked up steam out of no where and blew up into what it is today. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:33:23
And the counterargument to that is for all we know Bitcoin is Myspace.
The Facebook of Crypto might not even exist yet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:53:35
Sure. I mean in no way would it happen overnight. I also agree the longer its king the harder itll be to overthrow. I just dont personally think its anywhere near the adoption level of being impossible to end up overthrown.
I also dont think at this point if they get overthrown that bitcoin will totally die. Its hit a point where I think at this point itll hang around. Just might not always be king.

"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,"
Depends if you define income information as an unreasonable search. The supreme court so far has not ruled that it is unreasonable. Also it doesnt have to be searched to be taxed, itd have to be searched to be audited but your supposed to report your income, they arent searching you for it.
While theres an argument there, id argue its not a very good one. Especially given the fact theres an ammendment that specifically allows a tax on income.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:38
Well sure. My point isn’t that it’s for sure a bubble. Just that it easily still could be. That’s all. I think long term bitcoin will be valuable. Just not going to tell people to start dumping all their money in bitcoin. That wouldn’t be smart either. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:22:00
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft."
So while yes theres a risk of the insurance not paying in certain cases, at the same time atleast reading what they have to say about it its fairly likely itd get paid for the major attack vectors.
However keeping my own local copy is risky in its own way in that hardware can crash or be ruined, physical items lost or stolen etc.
Theres risk either way, its deciding which risk makes more sense for the individual.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:42:50
Sure some will some won’t. My only point is arguing bitcoin is a sure thing is going too far. Tons of people are buying just out of FOMO. I do think long term bitcoin has value. I do think the past year of surging is going to be a bubble that crashes and more gradually rises back up. That said I could be completely wrong there. There’s not much way to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:22:49


Because it still fills a digital niche of basically digital gold. People still care who owns gold despite it not being used as currency. I think the same could work of bitcoin.
I personally think its in demand now because people see it as valuable and think that value will go up. I dont think anywhere near the majority of people in bitcoin see it as a day to day currency. A lot do sure, but I dont think the majority do.
I mean your arguments fair, im not saying im for sure right. In fact id never claim that. Just where i think this ship is headed.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:40
Sure but it does make them like a gamble. Risky things involve a lot of things you cant control. So you can make your best guess at what will happen but because by its nature of being a risky investment you have to know going in you could very easily lose your money as well if you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:49:55
The better argument to me is it’s more like a store of value like gold. Bitcoin has some real problems that may hinder its use as a currency in day to day life. But seeing it as something like gold makes sense to me. It’s a place to store your value and convert back to fiat as needed. 
I️ mean maybe it gains traction as just a currency and that’ll be great. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:12:52
Im sure plenty have sold them off. Theres just a FOMO effect basically. IE its rising like crazy right now so people are scared to sell because well as fast as its going by the end of the year we could be sitting at 10k a coin. 
That said a certain chunk of people could start selling causing a panic and the price plummit. Just how it works with highly volatile assets.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:12:35
I dont disagree.
Just the chance was still a giant risk. Theres hardly any way to know when crashes etc will happen. If it was easy and a sure thing like so many people in here assume than every single investor out there would be pouring money into this. They don't though because they know its high risk and could be a bubble so they usually only recommend a small amount of your overall portfolio be in bitcoin/crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:03:49
It really is kinda like that. Well more like playing blackjack.
You can make decisions that help you win in blackjack, IE just like you can research bitcoin and have an idea of where its going to go.
That said theres still a large luck factor and well there is that with bitcoin too. It could be tomorrow the price drops back down to say 500 a coin and takes 3 years to go back up again. That guy could have whiped out that money and struggled or been forced to cash out low.
It was a giant risk on his part, akin to a gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:22
You can even remove the bitcoin part.
You could be like that dumbass why didnt he invest that money. Itd be worth 10k by the time he retires.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:05:45


A dumb decision paying off doesnt make the decision not dumb. You just got lucky.
Deciding tomorrow to take a loan on your house and blow it all on lottery tickets is a dumb decision. If the person wins that doesnt make it suddenly smart.


You cant know if somethings going to skyrocket or not. This is all easily a bubble that could crash tomorrow. (I dont think it is I am invested in it but it could be)
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:19:34
And they were right to say so.
Im not saying theres no way itll follow it or that it wont follow it in the near term, theres just also no guarantee it will either. Acting like something like that is truth is going too far. It may be it may not be.
Other than the fact it simply fits do you have any reason to explain why it should continue following the chart? For what reason do you think BTC should hit a million a coin in the late 2020s?
A chart fitting a line isn't proof of anything.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:08:38
Eh its the same concept. You make a point that there is a difference but only sort of. Taking out loans to invest in assets overall is a red flag regardless.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:07:42
I mean overlaying a chart and it in general trending doesnt really mean much for the future.
Theres nothing about that that means BTC will follow a logorithmic trend going forward.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:48:43
That’s not really how I️ remember how all that went down. Literally everyone had MySpace and then basically everyone slowly swapped over. Yes in the middle sure there was some people who were polarized but plenty had both. Like myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:34:48
Yep the key with most investing is buy and hold for the long term. Doesn’t always pay out but for 99% of people buying and selling often is just gambling. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:59:09


Ummm mind explaining where in the constitution it says you cant have an income tax.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:31:50
Yah but a lot of people are not investing in it for that reason. Trading it in to pay off things like debt or just to switch currencies is valid. Fiat is never going away but I do thing Bitcoin will become a much bigger player
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:54:16
Well if you cant afford to lose it you better sell some of it.
I mean do what you want just people really shouldnt be investing money they need into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:57:55
While it ended up now being the bad choice. Choosing to pay off the debt from a personal finance standpoint with what you knew at the time was probably the right decision. Dont beat yourself up. You made a good choice with the knowledge you had.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:28:38
I mean while there are differences its not an unfair comparison. Really it should more be viewed like the gold market honestly.
Bitcoin itself isn't like a stock but the way its value behaves and what motivates people to invest etc is similar.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:45:24
I'm not saying he needed to come up with a solution. Just without mentioning the solutions already talked about it makes it appear more doom and gloom than it is. 
I agree though not a good situation right now and it does need to be reported on. 
Edit: Id probably have less issue with the piece if it had just been titled Nuclear Waste as well but it was titled Nuclear. However then the whole piece basically just focused on the waste issues. Which yes are important but if the piece is on Nuclear power as a whole I think you should try and spend some time on the positives of the Tech.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:16:26
Everyone would agree he has a liberal show and its not source for balanced political opinion.
However his pieces like this are well researched and usually well balanced. He usually doesnt make up anything or leave out too much critical information.
Hell most of the pieces like this one arent even political so "balanced" isnt really an issue here. It makes me wonder if you ever really watch the show or just catch the politcal snippits. His show is often a major focus on an issue and its honestly not even half the time a liberal or conservative issue its more like Hey we wast a ton of food in america or hey FIFA sure is corrupt etc.
Comparing his show to Fox news is also hilarious. I mean it depends what you are comparing him to specifically. If say you want to compare him to Sean Hanity then I dont know how you can even argue they are anywhere near the same level. There are shows on fox news however that are more balanced and if you were comparing him to them I could see your point.
Hanity just spews nonsense with little research and constantly will try to discredit any negative evidence and the ultimately have to walk it back as hes called out on it etc. This isn't happening with people like Oliver because they arent ignoring facts in these pieces.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:44:36
Im confused by what this has to do with bitcoin though. You have to pay taxes regardless of what currency you have.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:31:16
Eh I mean I work in nuclear and I didn't mind his piece on it. I do think it could have been a lot lot fairer and did focus too much on the waste issue without talking enough about the possible solutions. It was by far in my mind his least well done piece but I admit I am clearly biased in the direction of for nuclear anyway so it was probably always going to rub me wrong.


I mean I dunno that it matters who or why it was shut down for the piece he did, just that it was shut down and thats an issue. The wast problem to me is a real problem. One that can be figured out but unfortunately is tricky politically.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:07:49
A geological repository like was planned really isn't the worst idea. The big problems with it are A) most places think yah thats great but dont put it here and B) Waste stays radioactive for a long time so you have to wonder about keeping it safe and known for potentially 1000s of years.
Now id argue that on the latter part you dont actually have to keep it safe for that long, you just have to keep it safe until theres a better solution. IE blasting it into space right now would be a terrible idea as it risks a lot of fallout and itd be expensive. However 100 years from now it might be economical and ultra safe. Storing waste for a century or two in a mountain could be done pretty safely in my opinion.
Other ideas are things like drilling bore holes in specific places and depositing it deep underground in areas that will eventually be pushed into the earths core by techtonic forces. Expensive yes but effective.
We also should get on reusing a lot of it, its still perfectly good for power generation and we could reduce the amount of waste over time this way but its not a solution to get rid of it all.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:34:05


Its ultimately about cost not energy, I think in a few 100 years energys going to be so abundant that worrying about justifying using it will be silly.


Im all for more renewables. I love them. They however cant support the power grid by themselves. Atleast not yet efficiently. Maybe one day the tech will be there but were a ways off.
Renewables (Outside of Hydro) are terrible at providing whats known as base load. They cant be counted on enough to provde a constant level of power. As such a grid running off of nothing but renewables wouldnt be a very reliable power grid. It would constantly have brownouts and blackouts any time power dipped below demand This could change but were not there yet and I dont think its coming soon.
So the question isn't nuclear or renewables. The questions is renewables and nuclear or renewables and natural gas. Ill take Nuclear and Renewables every single time. At least until Fusion or much much much better battery tech comes around

Why would you care about this at all? Why would you care about if the POTUS got made fun of or not, hes not your president.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:37:54
I get what you are saying I do which is why I originally said I didnt mind his piece and even admitted my own bias.


This is a bit of a stretch. Im not arguing to hide the flaws or anything like that. I think this is a big issue that needs more attention. 
Ill also add I did look up the piece again and it was titled nuclear waste so I take back a lot of my criticism. There were definitely still flaws to the presentation of it all but again like I originally said I didn't mind the piece. IE like the way it was presented there was little differentiation between nuclear power waste and weapon waste etc.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:42:13
I mean investing 100k in bitcoin would have been moronic. Yes it would have worked out (hindsight being 20/20 and all) but knowing all you could have known at the time itd have been insanely risky. You made the right choice.
