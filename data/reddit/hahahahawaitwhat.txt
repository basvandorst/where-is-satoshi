Not the same thing. It would be a better analogy if the scammer pretended to drop a $20 without noticing, and waited for the victim to (try to) steal it. Now, even if you catch the scammer, you can't go too the authorities without admitting you were committing a crime yourself. Same thing with the 419 scam -- go ahead, call the FBI and say "I attempted to participate in an illegal international money laundering scheme worth tens of millions of dollars, but got robbed of my $5,000. plz halp!"

You put "what little you as a family" had into Bitcoin? Sorry you lost it, but Bitcoin is not at fault here. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:19:46
No big deal.
The blockchain is about 18GB by the way. On a cell phone, this might be massive, but on any computer at all, even one from ten years ago, it's tiny. It is absolutely in your interest to store them locally, or even offline. The only reason ever to deposit them into an exchange would be to sell them.
I've sold a good amount of bitcoins, and I can tell you the brief periods of time between BTC deposit and trade execution were among the most stressful in my life. After that, it was far more time consuming to actually get the proceeds in USD from the exchange to my bank account... but that part didn't bother me at all.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:00:10
Uh, unless you're living in Cambodia or something, 50 BTC is just not a reasonable amount to consider suicide over. If you live in the US I think you should be able to save up $25,000 in a year or two working any average-or-better job.

Look, it's true that he's under a lot of pressure, but his own incompetence is what led to this situation. I'm quite sure that I wouldn't be shitting my pants now, because back in 2010 when I found myself sitting on a money printing press like Mt. Gox, I would have immediately hired a staff of actual programmers and built a real exchange, where a half billion dollars doesn't disappear and go unnoticed for years.

You'll get through this. 40BTC is a lot but you can more than make up for it in your lifetime, especially if you put it behind you and move on ASAP.
It's a pretty unfortunate coincidence that you have to deal with your relationship now, but you'll get through that, too. Reach out and talk to people if you need to, even if it's just online.

Of course you aren't being reasonable. You're being a stupid asshole. If it's that much of a big deal for you, then go write a Greasemonkey script that hides dogecoin related comments. It would probably take you less time than bitching about it here. But of course that's what you're really interested in in the first place, so that's not going to happen, is it?
Unlike your email box, there are a lot of people on this subreddit, and you're the only one complaining about dogecoin... so. Start your own subreddit, write your own filtering extension, do whatever you have to do, just shut your worthless mouth the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:26:57
You even quoted the relevant past comments, and still don't fucking get it.
No one, in this thread or otherwise, has claimed that anyone but the judge and jury gets to decide whether or not the guy is convicted. So, you're having an argument with yourself.
No, all that was said that a conviction wouldn't affect his credibility with some of us. To which you responded with essentially "your opinion doesn't matter," which is bullshit. And now you seem to be going off on some kind of man vs. state rant. Hardly surprising that you haven't found the conversation productive. It seems that you are not only an asshole and quite possibly an idiot, but a bit of a crackpot as well.

No one here is advocating murder as far as I can tell. The reality is that reddit is not the only community attracted to bitcoin, however.

That's irrational. Consider this story:
Couple in Vegas together. Guy can't sleep, so he tells his wife he's going back down to play for a bit. Throws $5 on  on roulette, gets $180 back. Lets it ride, hits  again, now pays $6480. What the hell, third time's the charm, right? Bam,  again for a payout of $233,280.
To keep this short, he spins the entire amount on  again and loses. He returns to his room, where his wife asks how it went. "Not bad," he says. "I only lost five dollars."
Ridiculous, don't you think? The guy clearly had the $233,280 in his hand and could have kept it. But somehow he justifies it as "not real money."
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:15:41
Nope, I've been running a bitcoin node on mine for a while without a single hiccup. On the same VPS as a dogecoin node, no less. They do use all available memory (1GB + 1GB vSwap) between the two of them, but that's fine by me, and it doesn't seem to ever go over 2-3% CPU usage... 
I'd be happy to help you debug it but I probably won't have time to get too deep into it for a couple of days (due to work). That said if you want to PM me the crash log or anything like that I'll take a look.
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:32:49
We understand your position, it's pretty clear. The disagreement stems from your failure to understand our position, and your incorrect dismissal of it as somehow irrelevant. Do you have any particular reason to claim to speak for the entire Bitcoin community? If not... how can you be so sure *your* opinion isn't the minority one?
Just to clarify, _my_ position is that even if he is convicted on all counts, we don't care. In my view, the laws he's accused of breaking have zero credibility, the agents and prosecutors building the case have zero credibility, and the judge and jury making the actual decision have even less than the first two. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:15:36

Do you know this for a fact?
Meaning, you have no doubt that (back when withdrawals were allowed), an old investor's withdrawal attempt would be fully satisfied from Mt. Gox's customer funds accounts, rather than just-arrived funds from new investors?

No, all it requires is half a clue, which is the part you're missing. You're spouting complete nonsense.
Firstly, it's not even, strictly speaking, a bug. It's a limitation, or a missing feature.
Secondly, it did not cause the losses. Mt. Gox's incompetence and negligence caused the losses. Clearly, you lack the knowledge to understand _why_ this is the case, but surely even you can notice the fact that every other exchange continues to operate normally.

Uh, no.
The "matter" at hand isn't whether he's criminally liable, but whether or not he has any credibility.
That's a decision for each individual to make on his own. If a criminal conviction comes down, people will decide for themselves how that affects the man's credibility. Personally, I share the sentiment above. Regardless of that, I'm afraid neither you, nor your jury, has anything at all to say about that.

It's not just on the Internet, nor is it just a lack of awareness.

It's not a debt unless you receive the goods or services before making payment.
Example 1: you walk into a store, pick out an item, try to pay with USD, get denied, and have to leave the item behind. Legal.
Example 2: you run up a tab at a restaurant, try to pay with USD, and get denied. This is totally different since you already owe them the money, but they're not accepting USD to settle the debt. This is illegal.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:57:57
Either, or both. They're both true.
(Personally, I'd lead with the bad news that I lost $10k, then follow up with the good news, but I'm an asshole. :))
Say you're playing poker and make a mistake that costs you your entire 100bb stack. You buy back in, hit a lucky hand, and double up so you're now even on the session. Are you now going to ignore your 100bb loss when analyzing your session, just because you made it back before the session was over? You shouldn't, that's for sure.

His net loss is in fact $5, you're right, but that's irrelevant. What's relevant is that had he made a different decision, he would have kept the $233k (minus taxes, you pedant) that he already had. There's a word to describe that in the English language, and it's called losing $233k.

Hmm, you're right. As you state, the 20 weeks is a worst case, but even if 10 weeks would be average, that's still longer than one would like. A sudden 90% drop is also an extreme scenario.

Jesus Christ, you want to nitpick about taxes? Fine. That doesn't change the point one bit. So he lost 60% of $233k instead of the whole $233k. The point is the same, he lost a hell of a lot more than his original $5.

You're glossing over some pretty salient details, like the fact that bitcoin exchanges provide zero leverage while FX exchanges commonly provide 100:1 or even more.
Then there's stuff like MF Global, a regulated futures exchange that we know took over a billion and a half USD from customer accounts. Now, over two years later, there's actually a settlement that might see upwards of 90% of the money returned. That's pretty amazing, and sure, a point in favor of regulation but it's interesting that this was an extremely unlikely result -- a year earlier, almost no one would have predicted that those investors would have gotten a cent of their money back.
Nonetheless, while no one seriously disputes the fact that the MF Global management knowingly stole that money, "by August 2012, criminal investigators had concluded that charges against Corzine, or any other of MF Global's former executives or employees would be unlikely.[69]"
So you'll excuse us if the "regulation will deliver us from evil" tripe from the likes of you is getting as tiresome, if not more, than the free wheeling pro-anarchy crowd.

If they had done their due diligence, instead of just handing over their money without even asking themselves _why_ or _how_ Madoff was achieving his superior returns. They preferred not to ask these questions, because they were blinded by greed.
This isn't to say they deserved to lose their money, but neither do the rest of us deserve to be inconvenienced by the government just to shield them from their own mistakes. On top of that, the numerous government inconveniences weren't even effective. Madoff wasn't caught even when a whistleblower provided the SEC with clear evidence of malfeasance. Absolutely nothing was done to stop him until 2008 came and he lost all the money.

Good point, I need to think more about this. Generally I have a somewhat binary view of money: it's either fuck you money, or it's just money. If I sold all my BTC last night for $700,000, it would have almost tripled my net worth but not affected the actual reality of my life at all. I would still need to continue working as a programmer, since that's not enough to retire at 30 and have any sort of reasonably enjoyable lifestyle. I would have much more cash in the bank, but the cash I have there already is basically just sitting around gathering dust. $700k is not enough to even buy a nice place to live in my area, so there is basically nothing I could do with that amount of money besides either just save it or (worse) waste it.
By contrast, if after some future BTC spike I found myself sitting on $10MM+ of BTC I can assure you I would have no second thoughts about selling all of it as quickly as I could. As soon as those transactions cleared I would take the money, move to Wyoming, and never ever come back. I'm not losing any sleep in this situation because even if two years after that it turns out that it would have been worth $100MM, oh well. I spent those 2 years in total freedom and still have a lifetime of freedom ahead of me. No regrets in that situation.
So the sick, sick tl;dr is that it's more money than I've ever had in my life but it's still not nearly enough.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:25:54
They don't need to ban it, they just need to refrain from ever printing a larger denomination than $100, and wait for inflation to make that amount too small to be useful. 
Consider that $100 in 1934 dollars would be worth around $1750 today. On top of that, bills in denominations of $500 and $1000 were printing and circulating in 1934 -- those would be worth $8750 and $17,500 today. 
Can you imagine the opposition to the idea of issuing even a new $500 bill today? Even though one of those would be worth less than one third of what a regular $100 bill was worth in 1934.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:54:45
There's some possibility that you're in a position to tell me something I don't know about the stock markets, but it's vanishingly small.
I should have been a little clearer though, I meant to say I wouldn't invest any money in stocks _right now_. Earnings have nowhere to go but down, rates have nowhere to go but up, and the S&amp;P keeps making new all-time highs in spite of reality. No, thank you. The downside risks hugely outweigh the upside. Prior to this weekend which rendered me unable to do anything useful due to my mental state and no sleep, I was actually in the very early stages of building a short position for the next few months.
By contrast in fall 2011 I was putting every penny I could spare into stocks. That worked out much better than anyone would have expected back then, but still not even remotely close to how well Bitcoin has done.

Why not just encrypt the wallet and upload it just about anywhere (Google Drive, any backup service, etc.)?
edit: If my house is broken into, all they have is a bunch of random noise (my encrypted data.) Then when I buy a new computer, I download my encrypted backups and now I have my wallet back. Zero chance of anyone actually accessing the contents of my bitcoin wallet, or any other data, at any point (unless they install a hardware keylogger that I don't notice, and it's able to phone home without me noticing or they come back to collect the results.)
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:34:38
There might be. I don't see the point, personally -- I still need to encrypt the other files in my home dir. Plus, the OpenSSL client gives you more flexibility (pick any cipher, mode, etc. you want) and makes it quite a bit less likely that a bug in the implementation renders your encrypted file insecure.

You don't bet on "32 red". You bet on 32, which happens to be red (but that doesn't matter). There is no such thing as 32 black, there is only 32.
The red/black colors are only in effect if you want to play an entire half the board, in which case you bet on red or on black, no specific number involved.
[Here's a roulette table]( The number 32 is obscured by chips in play (letter F) but it's between 31 and 33. Those chips represent a bet on "32." There is a completely separate, independent (maybe made by a different player, or not, doesn't matter) bet on red -- the letter A. There is no such thing as a bet on "32 red."

I don't use any wallet apps' built in encryption. What I usually do is just tar it up together with the rest of my home directory, then just encrypt the tarball using the openssl command line utility, so:
    tar cpjf - /home/hahahahawaitwhat | openssl aes-256-cbc -salt &gt; /tmp/home.backup.tbz2.encrypted
It will ask you for a passphrase. Don't forget it, or the cipher/mode you chose (aes-256-cbc in my example.) Now upload the encrypted file anywhere you want.
edit: I assumed Linux/Unix. It will probably work verbatim on MacOS. On Windows you'll probably have to download the OpenSSL tool (guessing), then you can create a regular zipfile and use the tool on it. Don't bother setting a password on the zipfile.
