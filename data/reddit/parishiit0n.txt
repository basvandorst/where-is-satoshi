One alternative is that your company can open a bank account in a HK bank (easier every day), so you can withdraw the USD there and then you proceed to transfer directly to your providers.
Other option is to try services like bitnexo and align commerce, depending on where your company is. They do bitcoin-powered money transfers between certain countries, and for clients is as easy as sending/receiving a local bank transfer

IMO the option to transfer/withdraw fiat from users bank accounts to the exchange in a local fashion (which is free and instant in almost every country) is key in the road for massive adoption. Commerce can't have the pain to keep crypto even for a few hours, and international fiat transfers are still very slow, expensive and full of bureaucracy. While I think fiat will be eventually a thing of the past, I think we're still 20 years away from that, so in the meantime exchanges have to play along, look for the best bank partners (there are many!) and I expect many exchanges to buy small banks in the near future

No matter how low it goes during the next correction, this ATH sets a new precedent at levels not even vegeta thought possible. 
Bitcoin had corrections of 93% and 85% taking weeks or months to find the bottom. Other times it crashes dramatically, just this year it droped 25% in one day, the $1,800 dip
It will crash againg and it will recover again. With all this high prices, the market cap is still minuscule. Dont invest money you might need during the next 2 years and you'll be fine. See you at $100,000

Adoption can make the price drop, since the majority of people that are buying stuff with bitcoin will spend coins that have been in their hands for years, thus bought/mined at a fraction of the actual price and not "rebuying" them after spending them. Then, 99% of this coins are immediately sold for fiat money by the companies that are getting them as payment. The result is an increase in the offer of coins, while the demand stays the same or cant keep up the same pace, so the price drops

Inflation comes along but not as fast as devaluation. There's a sweet window were exchange rate is beneficial for tourists before inflation kicks in that can last for a few years. Also take into account that the ARS was at 16 just 12 months ago, and the devaluation will continue for the next years, making a race between devaluation and inflation. As an example, restaurants and hotels prices are not x2.5 from 12 months ago to date, and when they adjust their prices, more devaluation will be going on, and so on. I expect ARS/USD to be at around 80 at the end of this year and 200 mid 2019, either official or black market
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:25:37
If you mean "buy bitcoins withous using an exchange or broker site, like coinbase or bitstamp, which require my bank account information in order to use the site" then yes, you have alternatives to that. There is localbitcoins.com, which is a peer-to-peer selling site. There, you still have to wire the money to the seller using a bank account (no credit card accepted because of chargeback), but some sellers are willing to meet the buyer in person in a coffee or something if its your first time buying and the amount is interesting (lets say above $ 200 for example). You will pay a prime for using localbitcoins, depending on your country it can be like 5% or more, over the exchanges price at the moment
If you have a friend with an account in a bitcoin exchange, then they can help you buy at a better price and you just pay them in cash if you want
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:08:14
Really great answers here, upvoted some. I´ll add something related to how bitcoins are made, or "bitcoin mining"
Bitcoins are made by computers called "bitcoin miners", highly specialized hardware that costs money to design, build and maintain, in the form of electricity and people´s time. This computers are all connected to each other and follow a very specific and public set of rules in order to create the new bitcoins. So, during the years, dozens of companies that only build this kind of hardware have been founded, thousands of jobs have been created and millions of dollars have been raised, to build better miners with more efficiency, making the most secure transaction network ever imagined, which is a fundamental pillar of Bitcoin and part of the value proposal indeed
Enjoy the ride

Absolutely small and I don't know the numbers, but its the growth of this companies what you should be looking for anyway 
Remittances is a very special niche because you are mostly dealing with unbanked people, either the sender, the receiver, or both, so the costs of sending money between counties is a lot more that if you have a bank account (which are high enough already). For their costumers, this companies offer something that is like going from black-and-white TV to Full HD streaming. 95% less costs (from a fixed fee plus a 10-20% fee, to a 1-2% fee only), and in a fraction of the time (days v/s hours)
Add that in some countries remittances makes up to 10% of GDP (Haiti and Lesotho even 20% according to the World Bank´s studies) and you have deep effects in a country´s economy

Some kind of downloadable firmware for digital cameras, or an app for smartphones, where the camera and the user are linked to a BTC address, then the user deposit BTC to that address and then she/he can choose to put the camera in "blockchain mode", so when taking a picture, the camera also makes a transaction (for miners fee amount) and adds a hash of the image as a digital signature to the transaction. Result: anywhere, anytime, anyone can check if a certain digital image has been modified after being taken. Users: insurance companies, building developers, sites like airbnb and ebay, etc.

What you are looking at is the way Bitcoin solves one of the biggest problem it solves: the double spend problem (in a decentralized ledger). Simply put, your wallet creates this "change-addresses" so you can only spend the amount of coins you have before the block gets processes with all the transactions of that period of time. In order for you to manage your coins, your wallet access a lot of addresses, many more that you think it does. Important to know that there can be around 10^77 bitcoin addresses, in the order of the amount of atoms in the universe

Yes, I heard that too. Also that there is a difference between the internal memory of certain printers, so some of them are completly safe because memory erases with every switch off, and in others data must be manually erased, physicaly or formatting the memory. Almost every cold storage tutorial adds a BIP38 password protection for the private key as an additional security layer, so we can keep our printers away from the landfill! I hope that feature is added to this gadget in a new version

As others pointed out, you are looking at the Wallet Import Format or [WIF]( of the "real" private key. The private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number (a number composed of 256 1s and 0s) so the possibilities are 2^256 or around 10^77, or approx the number of atoms in the universe. The WIF "number" (or string) is your private key in a special format that uses 58 different characters (not every upper and lower case character is used. 0, O, I and l for example) for practical uses

As many redditors have pointed out, any commerce can "claim back" some of the VAT tax payed when they pay the VAT for supplies and the such. This is usually made in a monthly basis, making an "add and rest" calculus and then paying to the taxmen only what they owe.
If a commerce that is accepting bitcoin is bouncing to fiat at every sale, then at the end of the month the amount of VAT added because of accepting bitcoin will be zero: no extra gain to the commerce in any form
If a commerce decides to keep a portion of the bitcoins for further use, then at the end of the month they will have to pay the VAT tax only over the difference in the bitcoin price between selling-day and declaring-day, and only if bitcoin is more expensive. For example if bitcoin is at $ 500 when the commerce makes a sale and they keep them until the end of the month, and then bitcoin is at $ 600, then the commerce will have to add $ 19/per bitcoin in their VAT declaration. Interestingly, if bitcoin falls in price during this period, and the commerce in question kept some bitcoins, then they will be able to claim "more" VAT back, the same amount described before. This will apply only if the commerce have "credit VAT" to discount, of course
I think this kind of laws try to make a difference between a commerce and an investor. So if I am a commerce and I use bitcoin as a medium-of-payment, then I just dont care if they make me pay taxes over the gains of bitcoin price. But if I am a ETF, an investment fund or something like that, then I will have to declare my gaining when trading bitcoin and pay taxes over that. So, what is fair? In my country, you must pay tax over gains in the price of stocks, foreign currencies, precious metals and property, so adding bitcoin to the list will seem to be very fair. But if that is not the case in your country, then treating bitcoin like that is not fair

Prostitution is legal in many places, but it is centralized in every aspect: pimps, brothels, nightclubs, motels and so on, all of them charge a huge part of the money transacted and they take an absurd profit in the industry because the workers are in the worst position to negotiate (no employee, no salary, no credit, no union).

Hi Smirfy. See it this way: every "exchange site" (bitstamp, kraken) also have a "wallet" since they must provide you a way to store your bitcoins when you buy them, but there are many wallets that are made to be *only* that: a bitcoin wallet. So, you can find many wallets out there with great characteristics that the exchange´s wallets will never have because that's not their core business. The most recommended wallets are Mycelium, Breadwallet, Green wallet and Armour, depending on the platform your are going to use (mobile or laptop mainly). 
If you are thinking of having bitcoins for a long time and not spend them, you should also consider have them in "cold storage" (do some research about that) or in "hardware wallets" like Trezor
Regarding moving your bitcoins, yes, you can always send them from your exchange/broker of preference to any wallet that you have. When you send them, the origin wallet should ask you for one thing only: your public key address (and the amount you want to send) and nothing more. 
If you are new to bitcoin, I suggest you to do many tests, since wallets are free to install and you can send like 2 cents if you want. This way you can see how everything works and if you mess something up, you dont loose your precious coins

$5 cost to wire money is not bad, but notice the 6 days delay. I´ve been working in the remittances market and bitcoin really shines there. If you are going to transfer non-USD for USD, then Western Union will give you the worst currency exchange rates in your local market, sometimes with swap and risk fees that adds up to 10% to the cost of a local bank or a trading house in downtown. Then, the BTC/USD exchange rate in every* exchange is, at a certain moment, almost always the same*, no matter how big or small the exchange is*. This happens because of smart use of exchange´s API, that takes liquidity from the big to the average and to the small exchanges in real time, like communicating vessels. Put this 2 factors together and bitcoin is unbeatable when transferring fiat-to-fiat when there is at least one non-USD currency involved (if they are both non-USD, then bitcoin is just out of WU´s league)

My opinion on this. 
The 10 minute confirmation time is the equivalent of having the CEO of Visa´s approval for every credit card transaction in the world, or like having the secretary of the treasury to check for every coin and bill in a business to guarantee they are legit and not fake. Clearly, this is not the case, and with Bitcoin and the 10 minute confirmation time is similar to this. 
When you transfer bitcoins, the first confirmation happens in just seconds. Each confirmation is like a "layer" of security, which makes it more and more difficult (think "astronomically difficult" to cheat, like spending millions of dollar on hardware to do so) to "double spend" the coins, and after a minute, you could have 4-8 confirmations. Then, the "Block Solving" is like the master of all confirmations, putting together every transaction during that period of time for the whole world to see... but that does´nt mean that your transaction is at risk before that!
So, in practice, if you are buying groceries form a neighborhood business you see every week, then there is "trust" in the transaction, relative off course to the amount being transacted. So the merchant will be satisfied with one confirmation, because he sees you every day and nobody will spend millions of dollars of hardware to double spend a few bucks. But if you are going to buy a house with bitcoin and you want to have all the universe cryptopower confirmation before signing the sales contract: 10 minutes that is. Hope this helps a little bit, and sorry for my crappy english! ;)

Well I think the problem is more about how to secure a contract/registry of land ownership transfer for the buyer, than securing the bitcoins transfer for the seller. I dont know how it work in Indonesia, but where I live, to give 100% security to potential buyers and sell plots like that you must:
* Split the "roles" of the land you own, in several new roles, each one representing the plots you want to sale. Surely you must approach certain regional authorities to do this, and comply with some basic regulations because it seems your land is in a rural area
* Write some kind of "promess" of sale (free translation here), under Indonesian law, that says that If (insert event) happens, then you will "transfer" the property of the plot to the buyer. The "event" is obviously the payment of the land. So, in your case, the transfer of Bitcoins to a wallet you own. This piece of paper is the only prove that a buyer have to go a courthouse in case the seller is scaming him, so probalbly it must be redacted following some regulatory frame
* Find a "notary" (commissioner, solicitor, etc) that is willing to "register" the change of ownership of the roles, as you sell the plots, and your are done. This is maybe a problem, maybe not.
Again it will depend on how it works in Indonesia, but I think this steps apply to a lot of countries. I will also recomend you contact the guys from [Galt Gultch]( they will definetly help you out. Good luck with your endeavor!

If you have access to an exchange where you live, using a 2-exchanges model is the best alternative for remittances: buy BTC in origin and sell them in destination. No matter how different in size, bitcoin exchanges have an extremely similar BTC price, for example right now the buying price in bistamp is 589 and the selling price in justcoin is 587. Also, the spread of bitcoin/fiat exchanges (not talking about a car shop here) is also usually &lt;1%, even 0,2% most of the time, so you can exchange "fiat-&gt;BTC" and "fiat-&gt;BTC" with total control all the time. The best part is that you can do ALL of the bureaucracy from everywhere in the world, so your grandma will see the zlotys in her bank account from the comfort of her home :)
You can separate remittances in 3 groups, depending on the number of fiat currencies involved and if the USD in in between
* USD in origin - USD in destination
* USD in either origin or destination, other fiat currency in the second country
* Different fiat currencies in both origin and destination countries (no USD)
Right now a lot of people are using bitcoins as an alternative to old remittances systems, and you can guess that the last group is where the differences are more evident

Very nice doc! Can I ask, in what kind of meetings you are using this document? What can you tell us about your audience?
About the content, my humble contribution: "Every bitcoin, or subdivision of a bitcoin, is allocated to a public address called a bitcoin Address, which are accessed using a laptop or cellphone using special software applications called bitcoin wallets. Every address is on a public ledger called the bitcoin blockchain". 
The other thing is that, in my own experience, there is something bad about using the lottery as a metaphor. Maybe the mining is like a lottery, but many people have huge preconceptions about lotteries of any kind. I have some nice experiences explaining the mining using Sudoku as an example, where the miners hire more and more grannies to solve sudoku that are more and more hard to solve, to get the bitcoin reward, something like that. Try it and compare whats better for your meetings ;)

As far as I understand, no.
If they don´t have to report the "same" trasaction if made with dollars (and this goes for banks and financial institutions too), then they don´t have to report it if made with Bitcoins.
What could happen is this: the government could be planning to impose harder regulations for the use of foreing currencies in the future, right? But, if that happens, it is not going to be a direct attack on Bitcoin from the government, but Bitcoin will share the same restrictions than other assets

Indeed, that needs to be solved first. This would mean establishing a company and opening a bank account in a bank that can do swift transfers to China and the US, where the big bitcoin exchanges operates. He also needs to setup the ATM with a fee that reflects the cost to transfer fiat to an exchange
Maybe the bank account is the most difficult part

Predicting? Impossible, but you can estimate the price in comparison to MB or [monetary base]( of a certain country or globally
Example: Lets assume today's US MB at 2 trillion dollars. If completely replaced by bitcoin and rounding to 20 million coins in circulation, that is the equivalent of $ 100,000 per coin. If today you believe that there is a 1% chance that a bitcoin will be worth $ 100,000 in 20 years, then its a good investment at $ 675 per coin, with a 2% interest per year on the investment

I personally like paper wallets a lot. Well done, they are a great alternative to store btc. Problem is that right now you are almost forced to do the wallets yourself if you want to be really sure that its safe. If you can solve that, you have another client here
In a way, the Mycelium Entropy offers a solution for the creation of paper wallets, but as an owner of one, its just a stop on the road for a better solution
If you solve the trust issue and your notes start to become accepted, then you will have another problem: counterfeit

*blows old history book cover of dust* 2,300 years ago, Archimedes discovered a way to test the purity of gold (king Hiero II crown was his test) because it was a very common practice among goldsmiths to mix gold with silver and other metals to cheat their customers. After his famous "eureka" moment, which involved running naked in the streets of Syracuse, anyone with vary basic equipment and some physics knowledge could now prove the purity of any gold object

flee form there soon guys, srsly
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:33:35
That would be 45 usd for 15,000 btc
15,000 btc = reward from 300 blocks (@ 50 btc/block)
300 blocks = 2.08 days of mining ( min/block)
If all miners would be willing to sell all their generated coins at that price, that would equal to 650 usd during 30 days. With an electricity cost of 0.10 usd/Kwh (cheap but possible), it means a total 24/7 mining capacity of approx. 9,000 Kw
Certainly a bargain

@_date: 2017-02-04 01:36:41
Today transfer fees account for between 2-10% of the total reward for each block, so miners have a big incentive in the fees besides just the 12.5 btc reward. Project that in time and there will be a moment where tx fees will actually be the predominant incentive for miners
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:23:55
0.00034% in transfer fee. Gold is awesome
And no, with bitcoin at its actual state it would have taken months buying-selling between local exchanges to move $12 b. with thousands of bitcoin transfers. Still much cheaper than gold tho, assuming 10,000 btc transfers at $0,5 each

Coinbase is OK
I am not an expert and its really hard to give advice on how to get into bitcoin. My automated response for how to buy the first time is to take half the money you want to *invest* and buy btc at whatever that day price is. Then think something like "where do I see the price falling in the future?". Right now could be $1,000, or maybe $700, or maybe it never ever touches $1,100 again. Anyway, set a target price and then split the other half in different (e.g. 5) "buy orders" (in-exchange or setting a price alarm) going from the actual price to your target price

I want to help here a little bit so the community can get the real picture of what this means to Argentina, since I know a lot of argentinian bitcoiners and it´s a very interesting case-country. I read the resolution (1 page), and every other articles in other laws that are mentioned (20-25 pages), and I might say that this is more of a positive step than a negative one.
Basicaly, the Argentinian Government is saying "Unregulated assets can be used to money laundering and to finance terrorism. We do not want that to happen. So we include Bitcoin in the list of assets that must be regulated to prevent this, under existing laws"
The list of institutions that must comply with this resolution are banks, investment funds, notaries, stock traders, credit cards operators, casinos, and other very specific kind of institutions that involve the movement of big amounts of money (car dealers, cooperatives, mutuals). Note that this list already existed, it is part of a law against money laundering from 2000, so for them, this is more of an "update" than a more profound change of how they do business
I also noted thay for each kind of institution (banks, car dealer, and so on) there is a minimun amount of money per client that is left outside this regulation, so the title is not enterelly correct (nobody will have to report "all transactions"). I couldn´t find this amount for an exchange, but for car dealers is $ 350,000 ARG ($ 50,000 USD, its the official exchange rate that matters here) per year per client before being forced to inform about the transactions and the identity of the client and all of that

Digital data storage has its peculiarities
ISP of any size (so called tier 1, 2 and 3) "mirror" entire websites in their own servers because this way they just send the data packages inside their own network to their clients. E.g. when there is a new video uploaded in youtube, depending on the company algorithm it can take 3 calls from the entire network of clients to make the ISP copy the whole video, data package by data package, in its own private servers. The result is that entire websites are copied millions of times across the globe. Why data packages instead of "files"? because of porn.

For many reasons, Wences is very close to Chile, and he is VERY respected in the local business sector, thanks to his history with Patagon.com and Santander Bank (and because he is a really nice guy). On the other side, *nobody* knows about bitcoin in Chile, specially in the traditional business sector. I work with big companies executives, guys with ivy leagues MBAs and on the top of their corporations and find persons that have never heard of bitcoin every day. There is no exchange, only localbitcoins and one broker, and less than 10 businesses that accept it, and thanks to Transbank (chilean banks conglomerate), we have free of charge online transfers even if you want to transfer $1. Imagine my surprise when Wences says this (free translation) in front of that audience "...if bitcoin is successful, which I am convinced it will be, it will cost between half a million and a million dollars each (...) the price today is around $ 350"

Forever? Unlikely. When? IMO is the step right next to when LN is working like a swiss clock
But core stated (IMO correctly) that the block increase should be determined by the network itself and not increased every x years by people. So the technical challenge is way harder compared to just increasing the block size arbitrarily

Just to expand: this scams are usually **automated** so don't think that there's a huge waste of time behind it to just fool a small number of people. That's not how this scams work. They would create thousands of profiles, get thousands of matches with each one and then automate all the interaction, so expecting to scam only 0.1% of the matches would make them a fortune
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:40:12
It's the opposite. Mining pools have *less* control of mining hardware (aka ASICs) than what solo miners have. Mining pools use filters to spot and avoid malicious tx (spam, double spend attempts), that solo miners are not forced to use, in order to give another layer of security to the network and their business. Every miner joining a pool can check this filters but most pools follows the same "standard" nowadays: at the minimum suspicion of an abnormal tx, it's just blocked from even getting considered into the mempool. Pool operators meet all the time to collaborate and share good industry practices too, so it's not easy to bypass this filters at all
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:01:24
It's long and complicated, but in short and in simple terms: segwit by itself doesn't do almost anything; it's a necessary step for second layer transfers (lightning network) and in the process it renderes Asicboost useless. Asicboost is a mining exploit technic used by bitmain to get about 30% more coins that the competition under some circumstances. And if you know bitmain was the big support bcash had.
So, since lightning network is just being tested and used (by a few exchanges eveb) *now* it makes sense to use segwit, but to use LN :)
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:20:38
They're not. Pools own a tiny fraction of the hashrate that they gather. The rest comes from thousands of miners (many smaller than the pool owners, some even bigger) that just plug in to the pool for better results

It was discussed back in the day if mere blockchain keepers should be rewarded as well. In the beginning, you'll need the core wallet to mine (the first Satoshi-made wallet had a miner in it). It was until later protocol developments which allowed for miners to not-keep a copy of the blockchain
The core wallet is the only wallet were you are in full control of your addresses. You talk directly to the network. Your monetary reward is doing transactions at 1 cent while permission wallets are charging users $1 while the cost of keeping the blockchain (under 200 Gb as today) is almost nothing

Never forget that Ver could have perfectly created his wonderful version of a crypto from zero like 5,000 people did during the last +5 years, proposing any rules he wanted necessary and creating a blockchain from the genesis
But no, he choose to capitalize on bitcoin's traction and credibility instead, knowing that exchanges would suffer heavy pressure from customers and get damaged on the process, thus listing his altcoin in a completely manipulated and unfair fashion instead of because it added any kind of value to the industry
This is the manipulation level he is openly willing to go through. I hope bch get forked 10 times during the next year

Which is, absolutely, the goal
@_date: 2019-08-31 08:24:59
The use of energy in data centers is not quite the same as in a bitcoin farm. Cooling gets a higher slice of the total energy used in data servers because those machines are almost always idle. But in bitcoin farms the slice of energy for cooling is marginal, not even 3% in many farms not even in cold weather and also because ASIC hardware is designed to work at higher temperatures

It depends on your background I guess. There are some funky math but nothing crazy. Very large numbers involved could curiously be harder to grasp (going from "possible" to "infinitely unlikely") and understand how the global monetary system works and it's history is imo a must to see bitcoin potential. Finally, knowing a thing or two about the energy industry is super helpful to understand PoW and to filter out the constant fud. I recommend a few youtube channels if you have time. Watch the Princeton bitcoin course (10 videos of 1:20 hours each) for a all round content. I personally try to rewatch it every year or so. The Art of the Problem is imo the best channel to learn about cryptography and other math involved. Again, watch all the content there if you can (is so good you'll ask for more). For a quick course, the Kahn Academy course on bitcoin is still one of the best online (7-8 videos of 6-10 min each). Hope it helps!

Bitcoin miners need a constant energy source so going all solar is impossible (equal for any energy consumption factory in the world btw), but what they **can** do is use long term contracts with energy plants so they can *use* solar energy but are in fact just plug to another type of power plant owned by the same company. PoW mining is unique in it's consumption/location characteristics (can be placed anywhere, can consume without limits). No other endeavor is like that and energy companies are using that to leverage their balance sheets and finance many sustainable power plants that could not be possible to build otherwise

Stablecoins come in many fkavors, but the most stable are backed 1:1 to a chosen fiat currency done by a central authority that is minting and destroying coins according to the fiat reserves. E.g tether with USD and the bank in PR who hold the funds
Facecoin will be backed by a variety of fiat currencies, the minting/destroying process is much more complex involving several institutions and the fiat backing is also done with multiple actors involved
Facecoin is aimed at remittance and undeveloped countries. It'll look like a mix of wechatpay with western union
@_date: 2019-10-19 08:50:01
Is the best question of this whole deal. In very short way to put it: the total number of bitcoins is fixed in order to avoid the creation of new arbitrary units in the future which would dilute the value of the existing ones. Each bitcoin can be divided in 100 million smaller units called satoshis. The "minting schedule" is transparent and predictable, and also immutable

No, its not safe for brainwallets. The cartoon is made to example the security of a password, but brainwallets are a different story. If you crack someone´s password, lets say, his mail, you are only getting access to this person email, not for every person email that had the same password. On the other hand, there´s only *one* brainwallet for any combination of letters and numbers. Anyone can start to *collect* brainwallets in a database [like this guy explains]( and scan the blockchain for any bitcoin deposit in them, to withdraw those coins to other addresses. 
So always avoid:
* a combination of random words
* text from wikiquotes
* text from literature classics

Q1: No
Q2: The code is open and public. Any person can look at it and make copies, variations and so on, but any change will not be considered by the bitcoin network unless the majority of the miners agree. I suggest you read about BIPs: "bitcoin improvement proposals", and how they are presented, discussed and implemented. Nice addition to your research :)
Q3: Hard to give an answer. There are two sides on this debate, each one supported by a group of bitcoin developers and early adopters with their own arguments and interests. In the end, the proposal with the most support from the network will be implemented. Satoshi, if you are reading this, please put some order on the room!
Q4: You can since it´s not a single person task, but a very long process. The whole network must agree to any change in the protocol

Hashrate jumped to bch because miners are doing their last quick block run before the bch fork (yes, bch is forking) in a couple of days which will fix the difficulty adjustment algorithm. After the fork mining will regulate and after this run the new difficulty will jump to the roof, without any way to artificially pull it down (which is whst the fork is fixing). Whatever happens, at least cryptodrama delivers

The payment for running a node is being able to set up your own transfer fee every time for every transfer, in a way that you're only paying the "minimum" fee required for a transfer to get into the network (as it's easily calculated by looking at certain parameters) and not overpaying fees by using a third party wallet provider. Ergo, a node is pretty crucial for bitcoin users with many outgoing transfers

last difficulty adjustment was in block 501,983, plus 2,016 means next adjustment will be in block 504,000 (250th adjustment yay!) Current block while writing is 503,067, so 933 to go. At current speed (last few hours) of about 1 block every 2 minutes, next adjustment should be in about 31 hours. Blockchair (yes, with an r) is good explorer for bch. After the fork the difficulty will adjust with every block

The learning curve for all things crypto is very long (in this world of instant gratification we live in), so one advice I can give you is to "take it easy" and just learn each concept one by one, with patience and consistency, and before you know it you'll get the whole picture of how blockchains work. You can learn from reading papers, youtube videos and participating in meetups organized by other crypto adopters (entrepreneurs, traders). A few youtube channels where you can start are CRI (Congressional Research Institute, they uploaded a series of videos explaining many concepts), The Art of the Problem (neat channel to learn about cryptography), and a channel called Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Technologies Online Course, which are 10 videos made by Princeton University explaining bitcoin. Also the channel Khan Academy has a course about bitcoin called What is Bitcoin (10 short videos)

True but as always there are some exceptions for the rule. During last year Kraken was building a great relationship with Fidor bank, I would love to hear more about where that´s heading too. Coinbase and USAA bank is another example, but I dont know nothing about it more than what everybody knows. In Mexico the local exchange did a great move and partnered directly to the local ACH (SPEI), which is really a case study for intra-country bank wires system. Since banks are 99.99% a credit business, partnering with ACHs makes total sense, perfect marriage to skip the bank cartel (which in many cases ACHs also hate with their guts)

It depends. Maybe you had your fiat money in a bank account in e.g. Indonesia and your credit card charges you a shitty IDR-USD-JPY conversion.

Total conversion: calculate 1% from interbank exchange rate

The most efficient and sustainable energy sources are geolocked (dependent on geographic location), such as Hydro, geothermal, Solar and wind. At the same time, the biggest energy consumers are alse geolocked, such as mining/refineries and cities. Problem is, both locations almost never match, hence energy transport and distribution costs are added to the grid making energy x4-x10 as expensive for the consumer compared to generation costs
Enter proof-of-work mining
Now sustainable energy producers can, for the first time, have big consumers right next to the generation source, just like coal and oil plants are constantly built next to mining developments and big cities

Thailand has a very progressive stand towards crypto with a very good fiat/crypto exchange, regulation and crypto communities to learn. To start, register in bx.in.th *the* bitcoin exchange in the kingdom, founded around 2014 and fully regulated by the most recent laws. Follow the steps and verify your account, then you'll be able to transfer baht to their bank account in thailand (they bank in kasikorn iirc) and you can buy your first crypto in the safest way
Send me a PM if you want to participate in the meetups organized by local community. There's a neat meetup this saturday in sathorn

Nah you are just misinformed. Mining does multiple roles at once. It's not only the creation of new coins in an unaltered expected manner. It's not only the transaction record keeping from inception almost 10 years ago. It's not only the ledger transparency and auditability for anyone to see. It's not only the safest computer network ever built, unhackable.
It's all of that simultaneously, and more

If you have a thai bank account (not hard at all to get one), then just use the local exchange ([bx.in.th]( to sell btc for baht, withdraw baht to your bank and then buy usd with your account manager and wire to Ireland
If you dont have a thai bank account, first check if you can open one because the alternative is much worst. In fact, if "at a time" you mean 4 times, any bank will open an account just for the $100,000 forex. Try krungthai first

You'll have about 0.000002275% chances of mining at least one block during that week (1008 blocks) of mining. You'll also need about 590 thousand years to get a 50.1% chances of solo mining one block with 1 GH/s at current hashrate
Consider that 1 GH/s is not that much either. The newly launched Bitmain S15 achieves 28 TH/s (Tera hashes per second) or 28,000 GH/s. Your chances jump to 0.0636% to solo mine one block with one S15 miner during one week
1 block (12.5 btc) would buy you about 45 of this miners today. You'll need to solo mine during 5.7 months straight (no difficulty changes also) to have 50.1% chances of mine one block and get your investment back

If you're comfortable buying crypto in an exchange with all the KYC, then imo sending fiat to it and buying exactly how many bitcoins you need per payment would be the easiest way. E.g. lets say you have to pay $50/mo in accounts. To avoid doing small bank transfers you can send $200 at a time, keep it in fiat in the exchange and just convert $50 each month at the moment of payment and keep the fiat there until next month. While it's highly recommended to never keep your crypto in an exchange, fiat is not really affected during a hack (I'm thinking about highly regulated companies like gemini or gdax where a scam exit is discarded)

If you plan to use it as a payment for some time I think that the way you plan to get your bitcoins impact your setup. E.g. if you'll use cash and an ATM then your setup looks very neat, but if you'll use a well registered fiat/crypto exchange where you can transfer the fiat at 9 am, have it validated at 1 pm and have your bitcoins sent directly from the exchange to pay something minutes after buying them, then you'll barely use your setup.
Anyway I like your setup and the research behind it, I just wanted to mention my perspective in case it helps

Bitmain has an advantage because Shenzhen as an advantage. Once more ASIC manufacturers or even big electronics companies enter the game then bitmain will really see real competition for once.
Also mining is concectrated in China for many reasons but most notably because of it's cheap electricity, but that is also about to change. Canada, India, countries in the middle east and in south America can also offer electricity at the same price range as China. Miners are already looking for diversification, it's not easy because there's a lot of friction in the process (eg. regulation, investors, willingness from electricity companies) but it's something already on the works

It's hard to say but if we look at history, this things tend to end with government doing massive confiscation of private property and funds because the game is over when they can't pay the salary to the guys with the guns. When even that happens and there is barely a government any more then is a big restart, a new currency overtakes the old one and everything repeats again. Situations like this happen constantly around the world but with the benefit for everyone that the dollar ends up being the *replace* currency (argentina, venezuela, cambodia), but nobody know for sure what can happen when it's the dollar itself the currency that is dead

Already has. LN is never gonna be "launched" like your regular corporate software. LN is open source improvement for the bitcoin protocol, which means it's being tested and improved mostly by volunteers. High risk takers test it first, proving it works, allowing for lower risk taker users to come next and so on. Besides regular people running their own LN nodes nodes, LN is already being used by one payment processor and a couple of exchanges announced they are actively implementing it. Before you know it Coinbase joins the party and badabing badabum, we have unlimited transactions per second

Afaik this is the current most accepted theory of money that anthropologists have based on extensive research and observing many different cultures in the world. Also, that barter most probably never existed as we imagine (cavemen exchanging tools for food), but that pre-money commerce happened by people just remembering the "favors" that they made to each other during periods of time, with witnesses involved if that's the case (a leader), and the community would just "self adjust" organically to function properly (less favors to lazy individuals and so no). A mental ledger, like we do with friends today

Denouncing this scam to your local authorities is the way to go. 
See a scamcoin event in your country or city? Contact any lawyer you can, tell them the story, how it will affect your fellow countrymen and try to start an investigation. Ponzi schemes are heavily prosecuted in MANY countries, but for the nature of this type of scam, authorities get a grab of it when it´s too late.
And try to never associate scamcoin in any way with bitcoin. "We have to stop it because it affects bitcoin"&lt;- NO. We have to stop it because it affect innocent people and because is run by criminals.

I am sure they mention that comparison in the Princeton´s Bitcoin Curse, chapter 1 or 2
Anyway, math!
*...earth is destroyed...next 5 seconds...* if author meant *by the hit of a celestial object* that's a very hard one to guess because that never happened in the last 4.5 billion years to have a reference and it would take a small planet to really destroy Earth, and not just life on her
So lets think in a *mass extinction asteroid hit*, one on every 100 million years. That is about 3,153,600,000,000,000 seconds between asteroid hits (3.153e+15 seconds)
Dividing by 5 that give us 630,720,000,000,000 so the probabilities to life on earth be destroyed during the next 5 seconds are 1:630,720,000,000,000, or  **0,0000000000001585%**
Now, what does it mean to *a collision occur in the next millennia*?
Scenario: each person on earth (7 billions) does 1 thousand transactions per day, during the next millenia, creating a new address for each transaction. That is 7,000,000,000 x 1,000 x 365 x 1,000 = 2.555e+18 new keys created in the next millenia (assuming HUGE adoption here guys whoa!)
There are 2^160 possible private keys, or about 1.4615e+48. Assuming it is a Birthday Problem, it is like having 2.555e+18 persons in a room, with a year with 1.4615e+48 days. What are the chances of 2 of them share the same birthday? [Doing some calculations]( the chances are about 1 over 2.23332e-12, or **0,00000000002233%**
So far, Collision Wins, but if we take into account that only 2,100,000,000,000,000 addresses could ever hold a balance at any given time, so even if you find a collision, then you have to calculate the chances that the address have at least a satoshi on them

Generalization v/s specialization. Bitcoin miners are designed to do only one procedure, the double hash function sha256. To put it simple, imagine this function as a series of steps involving moving the position of certain bits in a specific (and super complex) order that results in the complete mix of the information. While in a CPU/GPU this series of steps would be calculated by a software running over the operating system, in a ASIC miner this steps are done directly by the transistors of the chip, *physically*. The resulting performance can be on the scale of x100,000 times more efficient
You can calculate the hash function by hand or in an [excel file](

In general terms is very positive, when I explain the blockchain to lawyers, regulators and bankers, they really see the potential and like it a lot, but bitcoin is still a curiosity in this lands, nobody can believe that "something they don know nothing about" is being used by Microsoft to sell Xbox games online.

Its a GPU rig, so lets assume its made of ATI´s R9 290x, one of the latest GPU cards used to mine before the complete takeover of ASICS
I count 12 per rack, so lets round up at 50 cards. With proper setup (and mining at 95 C°), each card can give around 1 GH/sec, for a total of 50 GH/s 
With the actual difficulty, you will be mining $ 4 per month

In an exchange as big as foxbit you'll have a security protocol where the board would define x number of trusted signers (e.g. cofounders) and then y number of needed signers per transfer. So a x/y multisignature wallet for daily cold-to-hot wallet transfers. The protocol would define a list of rules like "trusted signer must always travel using planes, trains and boats" and so on to keep the access to the cold wallet safe

How do you explain the other 5 bubbles? Bitcoin markets are far less regulated (if regulated at all) compared to other fully digital markets like any modern stock exchange. Traditional markets have detected price manipulation techniques since markets started to go digital in the 90s and made them illegal. Such control doesn't exist in bitcoin, thus whales can and do manipulate the price with the purpose of increasing their stash. Bcash is a sneeze in bitcoin history not correlated with the price at all

It depends mostly on 2 factors: how many dollar swaps involved, and the amount transferred.
More dollar swaps, more bitcoin advantage. If you are dealing with a x.currency -&gt; dollar -&gt; y.currency transaction (lets say, from Brazil to China) then bitcoin is unbeatable. In some cases users end up with *more* money after the transfer is done. On the other hand, if you are doing USD -&gt; USD transactions (e.g from USA to a dollar account in Hong Kong), then the savings are much less, but at least its still faster!
Smaller transfer amount, more bitcoin advantage. International transfers under lets say $ 100 are just unpractical to do via bank wires. Not the case with bitcoin. But the savings using bitcoin are also "washed out" if you need to transfer amounts over $ 10,000.
Bonus factor: bitcoin adoption in origin and destination countries. Without a bitcoin exchange (or at least a broker) with proper liquidity in each country, savings using bitcoin are also diminished. Localbitcoins doesn't help

ELI5: addresses starting with a 3 are used for multisignature transfers, when for example you need 2 out of 3 signatures to make a transfer.

The answer is that you CANNOT go and just create your own currency because you'll have the police knocking on your door as soon as your market cap grows past $10. The question is "how did satoshi created a currency?" He created an open source (free to everyone to see the code, unlike e.g. a game) software of the protocol type (set of commands for many users to use, like email or compressed files), heavy on game theory and with many genius parts. One part secures a limited number of tokens and a minting process (role of the federal bank), other gives incentives for the building of servers that use a lot of energy (kinda like gold mining), and as a whole it solves the previously thought to be unsolvable "double spending" problem (what the US mint is in charge, kinda), making bitcoin what it is. Satoshi did all of this anonymously and regulators realized it can't be shut down, kinda like the music and film industry couldn't stop peer-to-peer piracy from happening, so they swallowed it and 10 years later here we are
