shitcoins refers to altcoins which is an abbreviation of alternative coins or cryptocurrencies that are not bitcoin. The pre-fix shit indicates that the coin is largely vapourware or perhaps a scam.

There should be a fifth one outside of the chains of block labelled genesis block that says "Bitcoin is valuable because it is the first P2P internet monies that is deflationary"

The central mantra of hodlers( aka holders, spelt hodl due to a miss spelling of hodl on bitcointalk.com in 2013) is that one day because of bitcoin's technologically superior function of money that it will become mainstream and widespread globally. This is because bitcoin requires no 3rd party human interaction and therefore no need to trust any government or bank, interestingly enough, bitcoin was released shorty after the 2008 financial crisis and Satoshi Nakamoto even includes the following text in the genesis block ( the "seed" or beginning of bitcoin ).


No doubt that Satoshi Nakamoto intended for bitcoin to be a competitor to our current financial zeitgeist. An ELI5 of bitcoin is like bittorrent but for money. The system rewards you for allocating your hash power towards the blockchain and in return gives you bitcoins; every 4 years the number of bitcoins rewarded per block ( every 10 mins ) is halved. Starting with 50, currently we are at 12.5 and in 2020 we will be at only 6.25 new bitcoins issued every 10 mins. This means that there will only every be 21 million bitcoins. There are many other mathematical formulas that help make the currency predictable and even programmable. Because of it's deflationary and decentralized properties, there are many different value propositions for bitcoin. Some think it will overtake the US dollar, other more conservative estimates think that it will perhaps take 5-10% of gold. The real answer is that no one knows. Personally I believe bitcoin is either going to 0 or will have many 0s, it will either work or it won't. If it does become a global currency then you can imagine the current M1 supply or M2 supply divided into only 17 or 18 million units ( we won't reach the maximum 21 million bitcoins in our lifetimes), if that is the case only 1 bitcoin could reach an astronomical amount.

yes but also 1bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin

Gold was only popular because it was the best vehicle for money at the time, it had a low melting point and was easily malleable, it was also hard to counterfeit and limited in supply. As money evolves, it becomes more and more abstract. Think back to when people used goats for currency; intrinsically, goats have high value since you could use them as livestock and feed your family, however as a vehicle of money there are lacking.
The beauty of bitcoin is that it is money in its most abstract state, it doesn't even exist in physical form, only in magic computer wizard spells thats are dictated by the laws the universe. Why would you want to peg to down to a inferior vehicle of money? I think in generations to come when asteroid mining becomes a thing, we'll be able to compare gold to when humans traded sea shells.

From a game theory standpoint, unless the majority ( 51% ) of the most powerful countries in the world decide to unanimously ban Bitcoin, it would not work. As countries start to stockpile and create infrastructure and tax regulations around crypto, ( this is already happening in the US ), it could quickly become an arms race, accelerated with Bitcoin's supply cap.
Even if Bitcoin/crypto becomes outlawed, because of its decentralized nature, the law would become very difficult to enforce. Bitcoin originally became popular through the silkroad on the darkweb, if they couldn't shut down Bitcoin then, it's far too late now.
From a technological viewpoint; trying to outlaw Bitcoin/crypto would be playing digital whack-a-mole. From a political viewpoint; countries that ban Bitcoin are just shooting themselves in the foot if other countries are accumulating.

don't get into any technicals unless that's what your target audience is looking for. If you're just doing a general presentation to a group of people who have probably heard about bitcoin but don't really understand it,  I've wrote a 5 min [medium article]( that goes over some points if you're interested.
In short, talk about its origins; the 2008 crash and the birth of bitcoin, what satoshi's intent was when creating bitcoin. Next I would compare it to our current online financial system. We already have paypal, visa, etc. What makes bitcoin different? ( hints: its the decentralization and solving the double spend problem). Then I'd conclude on the money supply, creation of new bitcoin halves every 4 years so that there is a 21 million max and also tell them that mining is essentially just computers securing the network. This should give the audience a somewhat completed picture of bitcoin without any major missing pieces while not relying on the audience to have any technical background or understanding.

@_date: 2017-08-12 17:10:57
whats interesting imo is that most early adopters are type 4. They aren't in it to make money, they are in it because they believe in satoshi's vision. To truly appreciate and understand bitcoin , you first need to understand how our current monetary systems works and once you begin to go down that rabbit hole you'll come to realize bitcoin's potential.

bitcoin mining is what secures the ledger that is the blockchain. In order for a someone to make a fraudulent entry on the blockchain, they must have at least more than 50% of all the hash power ( mining power). This is what is known as a 51% attack. The more energy/hash spent towards mining bitcoins, the more secure the network becomes because a bad actor would need to generate even more energy to "hack" it.

isn't the reverse true as well? 12 words is indeed easier but doesn't that make it less secure in turn? I thought the whole point of the 40 random case sensitive private key was to increase complexity and security. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 02:13:00
I doubt that an asset with the innate ability to be sent and received from anyone without censorship will ever be considered a novelty. 
What is really interesting is that bitcoin isn't just growing logarithmically, if you look at the past log charts you'll see that bitcoin has made 3 parabolic moves on the LOG SCALE in the past decade which is totally unheard of. Not only growing exponentially but growing parabolically on the log scale. Realisation of 70 - 80 percent of bitcoin's potential market would make it redundant to price bitcoin in dollars.
@_date: 2019-02-18 05:59:08
I'd argue that the Bitcoin market in 2011 was underdeveloped; Bitcoin was only 3 years old at the time and higher levels of volatility can be expected. The idea is that as Bitcoin continues to grow and develop, the price will become less and less volatile.
If you look at the peaks and valleys of the BTC price, (if we assume we've hit the bottom or the bottom is very near) then each peak becomes lower and lower over time while each valley becomes higher and higher, meaning the price over time will eventually stabilize as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream.
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:32:27
how do you artificially inflate bitcoins? how would you even run a fractional reserve with bitcoins? Since unlike fiat, you can't just "create" new bitcoins from no where

As Bitcoin continues to mature I just can't imagine btc mining staying so centralized. I'd imagine that once it does hit the mainstream, companies around the globe will all want a piece of the pie. Kind of like some sort of nuclear arms race game theory thing.
I think mining is still relatively centralized because the industry is still so new, and of course, companies who do decide to take a risk and dabble in btc mining early ought to be rewarded economically.

most likely scenario is a retest in the 3k range, if we do find support there it means 3k was indeed the bottom. Only once we've confirmed where the bottom is will we start to come back again

different interpretation or perhaps personal vested interests. Either way, crypto is the first time we've ever seen currencies actually compete against each other in a free market. In the long term if BSV and BCH prove to be redundant, then the market will shift accordingly and vice versa.

@_date: 2018-02-01 13:09:06
The HODL meme represents far more than day trading, its the belief in the widespread adoption of bitcoin as money. Many early adopters had no experience or plans to day trade bitcoin, however they HODL because they believe that one day, the value of bitcoin will be accepted universally. Many HODLers understand that this will not happen overnight. However, considering how fast the internet has risen in popularity, they expect it to happen sometime within their lifetimes. And so if you believe that blockchain technology will one day become ubiquitous; then the best strategy is to look into the future and simply hodl.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:50:35
I think in the 5 - 10 year range, bitcoin will either have many 0s or simply be 0. At 20k I believe we've reached the necessary critical mass required to snowball to mainstream adoption. Its big enough at this point that it won't simply fizz out due to lack of awareness and also robust enough that a single bad actor ( mt.gox / bear whale /etc ) will not cripple the system. 
The main concern for me is when the paradigm shift inevitably happens, there is no guarantee that it will be a peaceful one, money has always been a means of control and having such a massive rebalance of wealth on a global scale means that there will be as many losers as winners. Countries might start to hyperinflate their fiat as users prefer crypto, the massive rift between rich and poor might fuel revolutions, known bitcoin users/holders will be targeted for their wealth, forcing bitcoiners and other early adopters to create citadels, etc, etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:08:15
I think this is the best take away. Even if the ETF doesn't go through, the US only accounts for 5% of global volume. Bitcoin doesn't care.

that's because trading is a zero sum game. There is a buyer for every seller. Capital attracts more capital until we are left with a few big players (whales) who are able to manipulate markets and they are the only ones able to consistently make money, everyone else is just reacting to their movements.

its game theory. If I have a gun and you don't then whats stopping me from killing you and taking all your shit? 
If we both have guns neither of us will shoot since these are special guns that takes about 30 minutes to shoot so your enemy will know if/when you do.
Once 1 side has a major defensive/offensive capability ensuring that if they do attack that they will not be killed then its back to the first scenario again. gun vs no gun. 
The idea is that as long as we are both roughly equally powerful such that the use of guns would kill us both, then neither of us will attack.

one of the basic requirements of money is that it must be scarce.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:23:31
the rate of money supply in bitcoin is determinded by the block reward. Each block takes about 10 mins to mine and the initial reward was 50 bitcoin. The block reward is divided by 2 every 4 years. This is how the limit of of 21 million bitcoins is achieved.

I would argue that the first ever bitcoin transaction where Lazlo spent 10k bitcoin to buy 2 pizzas would be classified as a collectible. The buyer was willing to sell 2 pizzas for 10k magic internet monies where he had no where else to spend that money and probably just thought it was neat.
