I am not completely sure if I understand you but the transactions always happen in the same place, regardless if your client is open or not. Someone with a valid wallet can send and receive coins, this means it sends a message to the network to make the transaction, and then the miners incorporate that transaction into the bitcoin chain.

I think the 50 bitcoin reward can also be considered a fee to all of those holding bitcoins (because of inflation).

Bitcoin is not 'backed' by computing power like some other currencies are backed by gold.
I cannot take my bitcoin and trade them for computing power. I think it is misleading to say bitcoin is backed by anything.
@_date: 2012-07-20 00:50:53
But the strength of the bitcoin network can drop very fast, just as fast as the bitcoin price. As soon as the bitcoin price is so low it is not worth mining for the bitcoin network would drop in strength very very fast.
The thing that enforces bitcoin is as volatile as the usd exchange rate.

You don't have to 'rewrite history'. With your 51% hashing power you can create a longer chain that does not have any transactions than the 'real' chain. Therefore it gets only easier as time progresses.
With a 51% attack there wont be any confirmations for transactions that the attacker does not want to execute.

I don't know much about the Jalapeno but


The # of bitcoins of the blockreward halves every 4 years so the total amount of bitcoin is max 21 million. To cap it in this way was simply a decision by Satoshi. He could also have made it half every x years, or not halving it at all making the total possible amount of bitcoins unlimited (given infinite time)
Every 10 minutes a block is generated. So ever hour the sum of all profits (not taking into account transaction fees) for all miners is 50 * 6 bitcoins. Soon it will be 4 years so the reward is halved, so all the miners combined will earn 25 * 6 bitcoins every hour.
@_date: 2012-07-23 10:34:49
Well, it of course only redownloads it if you have deleted the blockchain from your computer. Best is to just keep the bitcoin folder as it is and only copy paste the wallet.dat to your backup directory.

Currently the network is small enough that you can connect to every node. The first that broadcasts the transaction has to be the original source.
And each time the same node is the first with that specific wallet your confidence is increased.
@_date: 2012-07-29 23:09:02
I have not taken any offence btw. It is truly a hard problem.
The most important problem that bitcoin has solved is how to agree on what transactions are and are not made. It has done this by creating a system where the majority rules and everyone can vote by adding computer power. More computer power means more votes for you.
I am just thinking out loud but maybe we could replace miners with a system where everyone with a satoshi can 'vote' and thus would remove the need for mining. Altough this makes it vulnerable for other kinds of attacks.


If the benefits do now outweigh the cost of energy the difficulty goes down until it will be beneficial. This would make a 51% attack easier of course.

After that you'll get forwarded to the site where you bought it and the transaction is instantly verified.

There is no strings that represent a single bitcoin. All we have is the blockchain that sais "at address x there are 20 bitcoins" and a key that allows only you to put in the blockchain "I send some coins from address x to other adress y". The keys of your addresses are in your wallet.


You have only keys to addresses that hold the bitcoins.


The blockchain is everything.


A message is put into the blockchain that sais "z amount of bitcoins transferred from address x to address y", signed by the key that belongs to address x.

You can, but the security of biometrics is less than long passwords if your whole computer is comprimised.

Then what hapened in July '11? We see a drop in bitcoin price and then a very very huge drop in computing power.
But if bitcoin succeeds, no hobbyist is able to remotely profit from mining and they will soon be in the minority. As people will invest more and more money into mining the profitability becomes more and more important.


Maybe I am missing the point but the computing power is used for the security of bitcoin itself. It is useless for any other purpose.
If I own 1 bitcoin and not spend it, I have accuired value because it is backed by computing power? Why then not buy something else like gold that does not need any backing?

Yes the difficulty would take a while. But the strength of the bitcoin network would drop immidiately after the 50% have left.
After 50% of the miners have left it becomes twice as easy to do for example a 50% attack, irrigardless of how fast the difficulty drops.

Nothing. But as long as the value of bitcoins continues to rise, you have to give a darn good interest. When bitcoins get big we will see bitcoin-banks (like mybitcoin.com), as not everyone wants or can keep his client up to date with the network.


I think the only thing you have to do is find someone who wants to loan some bitcoins to you so you can sell them, and buy them back at a later time to give them back. Investing in bitcoin and investing in stock is not that different from shortselling perspective I think.


As for the no-central authority part, that would not go against the fundamental reasons of bitcoin.

That he needs your login (probably just username not password) seems perfectly logical. What is the problem?
@_date: 2011-06-20 08:30:37
When you register for an exchange, you'll register with username+password and this token (device) will be send to your home. The way it generates numbers is unique for your device. The device calculates like every 30 sec a new login-code. When you want to login you fill in your username, password and the code on the device. The server then calculates if based on the current time it is the correct code for your account.
The idea behind this security is that there are 3 things:
 * Something you know (like a password or pin number)
 * Something you are (like a fingerprint)
 * Something you have (card, a token)
A good security should be based on at least 2 of these things. In this case it will be a password (something you know) and that token (something you have). So even if your password gets hacked/stolen they cannot login without your token. This makes the security much better.
@_date: 2011-05-17 09:12:28


But are they using them, or is everyone just speculating? Because if people only speculate and don't use, it's actually bad for bitcoin. Not many webshops want to deal with a currency that can drop 50% overnight.
@_date: 2011-05-17 09:21:31


Since it is peer to peer it will require an update to the client and at least 50% of the whole network would need to update to this new client. Assuming there will be multiple clients for bitcoin from different vendors it will be very very unlikely such update for the protocol will occur. The updated and not updated clients will create 2 different networks, so doublespending in both networks could occur during the transition period. I don't think anyone thinks that will be worth it.


You can only doublespend if you have &gt;50% of the cpu power of the network. The amount of bitcoins you have is not relevant.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:19:21

Edit: Ah I see, do you mean the bounty on Chrome? Well that is a different story.  Google does not invite you to hack GMail, the search engine or Orkut. It invites you to hack a progam that they distribute, not attack the servers themselves where tons of information and money is stored. Inviting people to attack your services will make them also more vulnerable to black hatters.

No, he is talking about hardware devices like these. A lot of big companies like banks rely on these. They are really secure, the number on the device changes every 30 sec or so 24/7. You need it to login and the device is tied to your account.

Every ~12 minutes a block is created. If for 2 weeks blocks happen to be created faster (as moore's law, or more miners) the difficulty of creating a new block increases such that it takes roughly 12 minutes again. Currently blocks are created faster than 12 minutes (as many people started to mine), so we will see huge increases in difficulty in the coming weeks.

Less than the CPU cycles of all banks, energy to print money, move it all around, secure it, etc.
@_date: 2011-03-26 12:59:35
I think the original paper is interesting, it gives you a grasp on how it works.


That is the raw function. The FAQ says:
"The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time."
The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.


You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.


For this you can just monitor the irc channel where all the nodes announce themselves I believe.


I think so too.
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:59:53


This is exactly what Bitcoin is. The coins are in the chain. The wallet only contains keys to access your addresses. When you store the access keys in a distributed manner (which is certaintly possible) you will need a second set of keys to access that wallet. Which would solve nothing.
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:34:35


I think that is irrellevant.


So it's like encryping a dvd with a random key and then claim its 100% guaranteed to be uniquely yours. Theft is still theft I think, even if its digital. 
Is it is already illegal to break into computers to steal passwords/keys, and I don't think bitcoin keys are much different.
@_date: 2011-06-24 07:54:40
Yeah that is a bet unclear I agree. It is correct that you don't need to have the client running to receive bitcoins. But indeed after you've downloaded the whole block chain they will appear on your screen.
I guess sending can also be done without having the whole blockchain, but until you've got the whole blockchain, the client is unsure how much money there is in your wallet. So if you try to send bitcoin without the whole block chain and there was not enough money in your account after all, it will simply be rejected.
@_date: 2011-05-17 17:50:53

Of course it is not failsafe. But the technique they use has been proven in the past to be very secure.
When a breach occurs (which is higelly unlikely), they still need the passwords. And I think the only thing that needs to be done then is to generate a new key and get everyone a new token.
That something has been compromised once or a few times in the wild does not mean it is not a useful technique for a trading exchange.

In order to calculate this you need 2 things:
* Your estimation of the size of the network in the coming months
* Your estimation of the value of bitcoin in the coming months
I don't think anyone can answer that, but you can fiddle with  to get a feel for the numbers. But I don't know how many mhash those gpu's would get.

Eventually mining is as expensive as the cost of the hardware and the electricity. In the end only the super efficient will be able to make profit.

That is asuming the GPU will keep up. I heard that specialized is going to be developped especially for the hashes. If that succeeds it may drive the difficulty so high that even the electricity cost of a GPU won't help.

How is the 'proof of work' generated? I don't see how it could work, why can't I just fake the proof of work in this case?

I got suspicious activity detected from Gmail but I did not use it for MtGox (I checked and my email adress isn't int the dumped database file). I did use my normal username. Maybe coincidence.

That is true. It's just that I wanted to prove that Bitcoin can be anonymous. You have to invest some energy in it for it to be anonymous though. But that is every crypto system.
Doing payments to an ip is not secure, as anyone can do as if they have that ip. And your ISP has full control over your ip, and that is what you do not want. And furthermore, if the transactions are not in the open, how can the network check if the transfer is not fraudulent?
Bitcoin is anonymous if you know what you are doing.

FYI, he (MagicalTux) mentioned FBI in the first post in a thread he started on the bitcoinforums. Probably he just meant authorities and not the FBI, but it is still amateur at best.

How exactly would they draw on your credit? Yes they can mess things up. Maybe they delete the database and now you don't know how much Sue owes you. But I think stealing money would be very hard and could not be done on a large scale like on a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2011-06-25 09:24:41


But they didn't. Even the reclaim page threw a full PHP stacktrace in your face when something went wrong.
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:27:04


Yes. Everything is public anyways. You can just go to the blockexplorer.com and check how much money there is in your address without having to know your private key.
@_date: 2011-07-06 21:22:45
It would be more tracable if your name is next to the transactions. Like paypal or banks do.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:56:27


Yeah, I cannot understand what MagicalTux want's to say with this. With 60.000 people investing in bitcoin, someone was bound to login and do the logical thing (buying real cheap).

Totally different situations. In the flash crash they did not try to sabotage the trading engine with unprofitable microscopic trades to cause trading system crashes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:15:22
I don't really know where to look on the website. But was the flooding to confuse/influence other traders, or to crash the trading engine? Because I think in the case of the stock exchange it was the former and in case of MtGox it was the latter but I'm no expert.

51% is enough to reliably create a longer chain in the long run, that is the only thing that counts.


That is not a double spend attack. Please use use correct terminology or don't talk.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:43:43
Nah, it's just that we can now see where you are going to spend your coin (actually only what address). If your bitcoin ends up in one of the addresses of SR (silkroad, anonymous ebay for mainly illegal stuff like drugs) because you have bought something there then that may be worrying.

You can still tamper with the phone with hardware and it won't change the IMEI number.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:21:49


A bugus transaction is this case is a transaction that was already made to another adress, one-half of a double spend. You first wire bitcoins to adress 1. Then you fork the chain just before this transaction and make it the longest chain. Then you can spend your coins again and send them to adress 2.

So as soon as a country stops printing money, the money stops being a currency and is an investment?
