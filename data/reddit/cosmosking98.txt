You have a option of where you put your money. If you trust bitfinex with your money you should have the choice to let them control your bitcoins and if they go under then that is the risk you personally  take. 
Unlike with government /country bailins I don't have the choice of what country I was born in.

@_date: 2016-08-16 16:50:01
Small block people expect all transactions on chain to be exspensive. Large block people expect  many transactions to be on chain and each individual transaction to be cheap.
Currently small block side is the path bitcoin seems to be on which will mean that if bitcoin continues to become more popular, fees will continue to rise.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:28:01
I would guess that half of bitcoin transactions right now are from darknetmarkets markets. I'd they move to another coin bitcoin price would drop dramatically.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:35:46
Bitfinex is a company the other examples are countries doing it. I think isolating bailins to companies is a lot better option.

Why do you need the full blockchain. All you need is the list of unspent bitcoin. I sure that is a few MB instead of the 60 GBs of the full blockchain.

you only need "Unspent outputs " not the full chain it seems like to me.

They are giving you the content in exchange for showing you advertisements. What brave is doing is taking their content and putting their own adds. 


It is only optional because people created tools to steal  that is why more sites are trying to detect the browsers mods and will request you to turn off ad block 
For Example
Youtube just changed the way they do adds to get around ad blockers.


Why should they make their content harder to get when the vast majority of their readers are not stealing.

To get a storj invite is easy just ask for one in the slack. But also i know coding this will take some time so it would be good to get started now. Storj group C testing is about to start that might last 6 months then storj will be 100% live.
 Also popcorn time has the same problem torrents have always had and that is that if it's not popular there are not enough seeders. If storj was used seeders could be adjusted base on demand very quickly .  
I could see millions of people paying 5 bucks a month to literally have every show and move ever created in one database. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 02:06:32
No discount? This is going to flop just like almost no one is  using bitcoin on overstock, Microsoft, and all the other random websites. There are simply not enough bitcoin users.

I would never say other alt coins don't have a chance. But if I had the option to bet and put my money on a particular coin I would always put it on bitcoin at this time. 
Why???  Bitcoin  has what we call the network affect it was the first mover into the market and that is where 95% of the companies in the cryptocurrency space are building there products. Someone can build a better Facebook,  the hard part is getting everyone to switch over.  Alot of people complain about the censorship of r/Bitcoin.  Goodluck getting everyone to switch.

We just had a conversation about this reddit being censored and now you are saying it's not? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:02:03
I'm not sure if this is true but my understanding is that paying taxes for items you buy online is dependent on the state you live in.  (I don't know how this works in other countries). So for example when I add a item to my cart on amazon it adds sales taxes to the final price. When I put the item on purse website it only calculates the the original price of the items minus the discount. 
I have used purse about 15 times and have never played taxes on a single  item. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:31:59
You just like to argue.

I just did not realize how long it was going to take to get the companies up and running. I have a feeling that we are going to start seeing a up tick in new bitcoin applications due to the up tick in VC money the past couple years.

It does not matter what the hash rate is when the miners are all centralized.

If a large majority of the community starts talking about a feature they want your saying because they can't write code they will not make a difference? Your saying developers will just ignore them?

how does blockstream make money?
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:40:15
So for example if bitcoin core comes out with a new implementation that increase the total bitcoins to 42 million instead of 21 million we must all just follow that implementation because forks are alt coins? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:10:00
I disagree. I have seen how the majority can influence who we pick as leaders. That is the whole point of Democracy.  That's like saying shut up don't give your opinion unless your going to be a polition. Even if a programmer writes code he needs to convince the stakeholders that it's a good idea.  Writing code is only part of the solution the other part is convincing the majority stakeholders who most of the time can't write code (in bitcoin situation) to move forward with the code that was written.

@_date: 2015-12-17 20:45:08
Well it's up to the majority of the network to switch to a solution like 101. Or wait until there is a solution by the core develops.  No one group is in control of the future of bitcoin. We are still waiting on concensus.

Great news to hear. I did a lot of research but you  never know until you use it. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:25:37
How important are nodes really? For example if we had 1000 less nodes would that change anything. What if we only had 800 nodes. I don't see how it matters.  I feel like anything over 300 unique people is decentralized enough. Maybe I am missing something.

So this entire argument is about allowing miners the choice to include a bigger block? Even though propagating large blocks is a risk to the miner? This seems like a no brainier just increase the block limit. There must be something I am missing because why don't we just remove the limit now? Why only 20mb?

If you haven't heard of the blockchain, I highly recommend you read up on it. You might have heard of bitcoin, which is the decentralized (global), democratized, highly secure cryptocurrency based on the blockchain. But the real innovation is the blockchain itself, a protocol that allows for secure, direct (without a middleman), digital transfers of value and assets (think money, contracts, stocks, IP). Investors like Marc Andreesen have poured tens of millions into the development and believe this is as important of an opportunity as the creation of the Internet itself."
What is bitcoin without a currency? It's simply a data base. How is this so hard to understand. The bitcoin currency created a trust less data base and it would not work without the currency. WTF!!

There is a reason that even though you can buy things with bitcoin it is never priced in bitcoin. Still way to volatile. I am sure back when bitcoin was 10 bucks there was more volume in acutall bitcoin  but that does not tell you much. 
At this point in time looking at volume in dollars makes a lot more sense.

He might have bought 20 million. Who knows.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:01:53
This just means that most transactions will have to go through a 3rd party and the fees to be on the block chain will just continue to rise. 
But even if we raise the block size to 20mb eventually that will not be big enough. Do we just raise the block size again? When do we stop raising the block size, especially if we are expecting the fees to pay the miners. But then again even if fees are low and mining is not profitable some miners would just stop mining and there will be less miners but the network  would continue to run so would it even matter if there are not that many fees?
@_date: 2017-02-02 06:09:24
Segwit is only at 25% what about the rest of the hashing power?
@_date: 2016-01-01 23:05:26

Send the coins to shape shift exchange them with a alt coin and then back to bitcoin. After that send to coinbase and withdraw. Coinbase will shut down your account if they see that the coins came from a gambling site.

I am only going to speak for the western 1st world countries. The reason it is not main stream is because there needs to offer more benefits to the avarage consumer. In my opinion the only reason to use bitcoin right now is to get 25% of amazon using purse.io and fold app to get 20% off starbucks. 
I am hoping in the near future there will be a really great cool game that will incorporate bitcoin in a fun unique way. Digital cash and games are a no brainier in my opinion.

I don't understand your point. The only way to change the protocal is for the miners to switch.

Omg the dollar is going to crash!! NOT!!

I disagree, what needs to happen is there needs to be more use cases that benefit the public.  The only one right now is to use purse.io to get 25% off amazon or the fold app to get 20% off Starbucks. Other than that the only reason to own bitcoin is to speculate for the future price.

Its called blacklisting coins and which is why a lot of people dont believe bitcoins are fungible.

@_date: 2017-03-08 05:10:45
Once you answer my simple question you will understand why the thousands of nodes you are talking about don't matter. 
Why don't we have segwit blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-02 05:59:47
2 nodes to run smoothly,  now when it comes to security it is not about how many nodes but how many nodes are controlled by different people. So I old say we would only need about 100 non colluding nodes to keep bitcoin safe. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:28:27
This is all cores fault they should have compromised and hard forked to 2 Mbs a year ago.

There needs to be a killer app that requires bitcoin to use it like a game or some crazy way to easily shop and get huge discounts. ( I know purse exists but I think it needs to be simplified.) Until then the average person in the west has no use for bitcoin. Especially because of how volatile it is. Currently bitcoin is just a speculative investment.
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:07:48
I think we are finally starting to see some real apps coming into play. Storj.io, zeronet, dark markets growing, gambling online, I think we can get there.

I actually put more blame on the miners. Core devs really don't belive the block size should increase for many reasons. 
Miners have options to run bitcoin classic or unlimited.  Which means miners must not think it is important to have bigger blocks right now. Miners ultimately are the ones that make the decision. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:16:58

There will be less bitcoin being created  every day. Some people think because of that there will be less sale pressure on the exchanges. If there is less sale pressure prise should rise. 
When it comes to security of the network that is tricky no one knows what will happen.  Maybe it drops a little and it becomes profitable for people in other countries besides chine to mine.  Maybe none of the miners will leave and continue to mine.   Remember just a couple months ago the price of bitcoin was at 300 now it's 650. Lots of factors to consider.

I am going to get crucified for telling you this, by this subreddit but it is honestly the best advice for a noob.
Buy from coinbase.com and then put your bitcoins in their vault. When your coins are in their vault you dont have to worry about getting hacked and coinbase has your coins insured if they are hacked.
Once you feel comfortable with controlling your own private keys then you can move them.

It is impossible to guess. It could take 10 years or there could be a killer app built on top of bitcoin which causes a huge demand for the coin by the general public and it could get there in 6 months. 
Say there is a bitcoin game in the app store that gets crazy popular like cash of clans or angry birds. These games have over 100 million players. Lets say in this bitcoin game 20% of that 100 million need like 5 dollars were of bitcoin for some feature in the game. If 20 million people bought 5 dollars were of bitcoin right now the price would go through the roof. (Also 20 million people is not that many people when we are talking about the world)
Also also keep in mind the larger the bitcoin economy gets the less need to sell bitcoin in to fiat. So when you have high demand and people stop selling bitcoin when the price rised and instead spend it on goods and services the supply will get incredibly low and the price can start jumping 1000 dollars a hour. 
This might sound crazy but its really possible. I even think likely. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:32:36

To be honest it takes a lot more than 10 minutes to really understand bitcoin and just about everyone in this sub passed on bitcoin the first time they herd about it. At a quick glance bitcoin does look like a scam. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:44:28
Genius, I could see a lot of companies using this. Billions of dollars could flow in.
Imagine a new movie coming out. They could use this to advertise. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:25:56
If this thing is mainstream, I would guess at least 500,000 a coin. 
If this dominates like the internet does, omg we will all be rich. The crazy thing about all of this is that it is really possible this is not some scam. If bitcoin can solve enough problem its inevitable it is literally better money. 
I am sure a crypto currency will dominate the world but my only concern is that will it be bitcoin or will it be another cyrpto.

Without looking at transaction I can assume your fee is not high enough. That is the only possible reason.

This is good for bitcoin because it makes it look like the adult mature crypto and all the other coins are science experiments. But if one of the science experiments works and is useful bitcoin can copy.

You can't transfer gold instantly to anyone around the world.
If you have a ounce of gold it's incredibly difficult to break off a 5 dollar piece and pay someone.
Gold is physical and can easily be stolen.
Gold is minipulated because a lot of people own paper gold.
I can go on and on, gold sucks. Bitcoin can easily be higher. 
And I am not talking about 1btc parity to 1 once of gold I am talking about the market cap of bitcoin can be bigger than gold.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:56:58
Even tho I think bitcoin is 10 times better than gold it will not pass gold until it passes gold in market cap.
This whole gold parity thing is stupid.

Thank you for the explanation. So what you are saying there is no way that all the nodes can just agree to create a new theoretical Genesis block?  Let's say for example 1 year ago from today we agree that this is the new state of the network. Block 65,000 was mined we know the state of all coins and witch address hold the coins as of august 12 2016. There has been a year of proof of work on top of block 65,000.  Can we just delete all data before this?

Curiosity and the bigger picture. The more i learn about economics it is clear to me it is not a science.  you have to understand the population and the society. 
When property values go up its not taking wealth from other things. Its creating new wealth and that is why it can quickly disappear like in 2008/ 09. I think bitcoin is acting more like property right now. 
I dont agree with everthing you said but I like to see other opinions.

Inflation of dollars has nothing to do with saying Bitcoin price going up causes purchasing power of dollars to go down. 
Printing money is inflation so I don't see how Bitcoin is affecting dollar purchasing power.

In the past when bitcoin was stolen from the exchanges the fiat money was never returned as well. 
I would not leave it in the exchange. I personally think coinbase/ gdax is safe but that is just my opinion

I Dont know what this method is called but what it did was interesting. Lets say my first word in the phrase was "jump" on the keepkey it would have like a chart and to type "J" the keepkey said you must press "N". Once I pressed N then the entire alphabet would change again. So when I need to type "U" it would say press "D". So even though I am spelling jump the keylogger would see "nupy".

Why can't you have it both ways there are financial  products for almost every situation. Not everyone agrees inflation is bad. Everyone has different opinions on what is good economic policy. I feel as long as you have access to financial products that fit your needs there is no issue.

Looks like miners don't want segwit.  But I do wish we had statements from the pools themselves. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:10:39
Imagine how much hashing power and money you would need to have more proof of work to change the block chain for a year. Yes technically possible but I seems to me very unlikely. But even then we can change it to 3 years or 5 years. That would still be fine.

@_date: 2016-12-14 09:23:42
They were never the ones blocking segwit.  Currently there is only 25% support. This never had anything to do with roger.
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:52:18
Everyone who is currently getting paid in bitcoins, salary is denomimated in fiat and they convert to the correct amount of bitcoin at the time they get there check. 
For example know one is like on a fix monthly salary of 6 bitcoins a month. Bitcoin fluctuates to much to do this.
So these people would still be affected .

Yeah I think mining is so centralized they each pool operator probably owns about 80% of the hashing in that pool.

The other side wants 2 or 4 Mbs blocks. So let's ignore segwit for now. They want to change the block size from 1 to 2 or 4. ( that is there compromise because they would go a lot bigger.) So imagine without segwit  we move to 2 or 4mb blocks. Then we add segwit on top of it. 
That's the comprises that is needed.

Yes it does that is why the word equilibrium exist. 
Edit: other wise what you are saying is that the smaller the block the higher the fees. Well why not make the block size big enough for 1 transaction and get the highest fee?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:24:11

You did not answer my question. Hardfork 2mb +segwit vs your proposal of softfork  1mb + segwit.  Which can hold more on chain transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:56:16
Whatever profit you made when you sold your bitcoins back to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 09:40:16
25% we need 95%.  I am even somone who wants bigger blocks but I have shut up about it because I want segwit more. But it is a big mountain to climb. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:32:00
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:47:32
No problem at all as long as you use a reputable exchange.

How is it trash? I read the article and listen to the podcast.
@_date: 2016-06-29 19:10:39
That's like saying if my bitcoins were stolen from my wallet bitcoin the network was hacked.

I don't have any issues with circle my transactions always get confirmed in the first block.
Anyway maybe uphold is what you are looking for.

Who is dumb enough to sell there bitcoin for that currency?
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:45:40
Whatever, let's fork again I like free money.

Centralised companies have certain benefits.  For example coinbase to coinbase transactions have 0 fees and are instant.
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:35:46
Luke they want to remove the block limit all together like it was orginally. The fake 2 Mb softfork with segwit is not a compromise. 
Then they compromise from 20 to 8 to 4 to 2mb blocks. Some still want dynamic. 
Why do you keep pretending like you don't understand the difference between a hardfork 2mb + segwit vs your 1mb + segwit.
Question in this hypothetical situation  which one of those two options could have more on chain transactions. Hard fork 2mb + segwit or your current proposal 1mb plus segwit?
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:17:37

This is a penalty because you probably can't get money out of india.

The other sub forked off already. I think this is starting a new battle in r/Bitcoin again. My understanding is that miners and exchanges were ok and signaled for segwit 2x.  We might have another Bitcoin fork soon.
@_date: 2016-11-01 18:33:07
The real pump is going to be insane. I can easily see it jumping 5000 dollars a day. Because once miners can pay all there bills in bitcoin there will be no need to sale and when average users start to be able to pay there day to day actives with bitcoin.  There will be very few sellers. 
Moon moon moon and it's coming.

If we hardfork 2 Mb and then have segwit what would the block size be?

I agree
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:57:48
We need bitcoin to be at least 500 billion market cap before we start talking to large corporations. 
True chicken and egg problem.

Ok and the one month the say sorry we are hacked and bitcoins are gone. Then what?
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:42:12
I think its to early to tell. Let's see what happens to the price if it is approved.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:44:30
Just download a bitcoin wallet on your phone. Then you will need to buy some bitcoin and transfer it to your wallet.

That's why if the blocksize was large miners probably would not create large blocks. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 04:03:49
2 or 4mb blocks with segwit and the community would unite. Unfortunately  both sides are sticking to theirp guns.
Remindes me of the Republican and Democrats fighting. Both say they want infstructure spending and simplified tax code but cant work together to get it done.

I don't think this has anything to do with trump
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:16:33
My point is that I can't think of a reason it would ever be needed and if we don't need it that allows way bigger blocks if we can have checkpoints.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:49:23
Centralised mining is the only way this attack works.

No I am saying those companies struggle with capacity as they grew from a small company to a larger one.
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:00:32
Yeah but if 1% of nodes move over we would be fine. Obviously you can't have zero nodes.
@_date: 2016-11-02 08:47:08
I think when gets people caught is converting it to dollars. I bet people most people who stole bitcoin keeps it in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:54:07
The scalling debate will not end for a couple years. Bitcoin will be fine though. None of the all coins have a economy to stand on.

Weird how my investment in bitcoin goes against my ideology.  
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:53:58
You do know that even if bitcoin becomes main stream there will still be bankers.

@_date: 2016-12-26 21:20:53
Coinbase is a bank. But that is not a secret that is upfront and the trade off is a easy way to buy bitcoins. I dont see anything wrong with that. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:08:48
And now trump is going to help bitcoin by increasing the drug war and putting terrifs on China and mexico.

Longest chain determines bitcoin you can stay on shorter chain but that would be equivalent to using ethereum  classic.
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:28:01
The sad part is the the block size increase is not going to happen or the scalling abilities of segwit. Looks like we are stuck with where we are. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:04:57
My strategy is to buy when bitcoin becomes stable for 2 to 3 weeks. So I do not buy when it goes up or down.

Think about a flip phone around the year 2000. Battery technology has gotten better and batteries are bigger.

There are many other pools who are not alighned with him who are not supporting segwit that is what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:19:56
What I also find interesting is that if bitcoin becomes the reserve currency you can no longer define the value in dollars you would have to define it in bitcoin.
And when some says that a house cost .045 bitcoin what will that mean?.

As long as I get my discount I don't care. I don't think there are stolen cards being used. If it is I would think it's minor

There is one small security concern with all hardware wallets. The company who built your hardware wallet  send out software updates .

It cost 15 cents to transfer bitcoins right now. I don't think bitcoin is ready for this country at this time. To be honest it can really only be used by the first world who can afford it. 
But I am not even sure how much the first would really needs it. Besides doing illegal things like drugs and gambling. Store of value is a good use case I guess.
Maybe once we have lighting network it will be beneficial to poor countries.
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:51:45

So you have a business that is in the gray area of legality because it's federally illegal. Seems like a quick way to go to jail to mix it with bitcoin which is known for illegal activity like drugs.

It reduces fees by being able to send transactions without it needing to go on the blockchain.
Yes it does take money from miners but the goal is to give bitcoin more utility so that the price of bitcoin goes up. Which will give the miners more money.
In the far future when transaction fees are the main funder for miners there should be so many people using bitcoin that with 1 Mb blocks there will still be so much demand that to settle on chain would be very large fees. I belive over 50 bucks a transaction.

Actually I did the recovery phase and not even a keylogger would know what my phrase is.
I Dont know what this method is called but what it did was interesting. Lets say my first word in the phrase was "jump" on the keepkey it would have like a chart and to type "J" the keepkey said you must press "N". Once I pressed N then the entire alphabet would change again. So when I need to type "U" it would say press "D". So even though I am spelling jump the keylogger would see "nupy".

There are consequence for not raising the blocksize as well. But look I am not here arguing for or against I was just answer OP question.

@_date: 2016-11-20 05:53:09
Yeah maybe I don't understand. So segwit introduces bigger blocks? I did not know that, my understanding was if everyone went segwit 1mb  as far as number of transactions are concerned is equivalent to 1.7 Mbs blocks.

The upside potential is crazy high

GB miners are signaling they are for bigger blocks. The chain will not fork unless a large majority of miners also do the same thing. So if this happened the people who stay with smaller blocks will be on the wrong chain.

Small blockers belive this is a attack vector. One can simply spam the blockchain creating 1gb blocks if not bigger. Making less people run nodes.

I do not belive the Irs will come after you for buying stuff with bitcoin and not reporting it. Now if you sold food for bitcoin that is a taxable event.

These big corporations cant really hold bitcoin right now because of the volatility and plus i am sure less than 1% of there customers even use bitcoin. 
But I believe when the market cap gets to around 500 billion dollars bitcoin will act more like a currency and they can start holding it. 
14 billion is nothing but the fact that it went from 0 to 14 is amazing. So much upside in this investment. I really think a big bubble is coming soon that will get us to 50 billion. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:26:38

There is no need to mine empty blocks if you want higher fees.

@_date: 2016-11-25 18:50:45
Well I think it's clear from core that they want to keep block size small and if blocks are small and bitcoin becomes really popular that one can only conclude that fees will probably be hundreds of dollars per transaction. 
But I have a feeling that most people will never settle on chain and will run only on 2nd or 3 layers above bitcoin. Only large companies will settle on chain. 
That is my guess.
@_date: 2016-12-06 01:05:58
I know it exist but are you implying the government is going to make it mandatory?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:14:01
Let's say I send you 20 bucks in bitcoin with a very low fee. (Which means It might take a while to get confirmed.)
Then right after I that exact same 20 bucks to another wallet I own with a high fee. 
The higher fees transaction will most likely get confirmed before the transaction is sent to you.
Now you are out 20 bucks. You must wait for confirmation to make sure the bitcoin i in your possession.

I don't like bip 100 seems to give miners to much control. It is in there benefit to keep blocks small to increase fees. 
What I like about bipolar 101 is that each individual mining pool decides what block size they want making each pool compete against another. So if block size limit is 32 MB, some miners might decided they want only 10 MB blocks but other miners might decided to have 32. I like that better.

I am a atheist so we have no disagreement on that part and I think social programs like free college is something that can help with the ridiculous religious beliefs people have. Studies have shown  the more educated you are the less likely you are to be religious. 


In democracy not everyone is going to agree on the same thing, that is why majority rules and everyone is forced to follow and I dont think that is losing the moral high ground. Yes I agree everything has cost and that is why countries like Denmark have high taxes. 


Here is the problem you run into. Lets say we give the option to pay into the healthcare system or not. Then the family who does not pay into this system gets hurt and has to go to the emergency room. Now our morals as a country makes us treat that person and not let them die. That cost has now been transferred to the people who are paying into the system. Now if we are just going to let people die, then maybe your system would work. Its the same reason we force people to have car insurance your actions affect other people.

@_date: 2016-02-22 01:49:09
Yes but that is a transaction fee on the blockchain. So for LN to be useful you need to put maybe at least enough in the channel to last a week. So for me that is maybe 300 dollars right now. Bitcoin is to volatile for me to let 300 dollars sit there for a week. 
Unless your a holder and you just replace your bitcoin the moment you spend it. But then that still another transaction happening on the blockchain when you buy new bitcoin. So its not reducing  transaction on the bitcoin blockchain. Unless you just simply do not care about the volatility.

All you have to do is publish the data for example if its a financial company that wants to say that at this point in time on February 5th at 5pm this is our books. You make that public or you disclose it to whoever it needs to be disclosed to. You can disclose this every day or every hour if you want. 
Also in a data base you can see who logged in and made changes. So I don't understand the need for"block chain".

You need to find out what kind of wallet he used. Was it a online wallet like coinbase or circle? Check browser history for the websites might be the easiest way.

So was bitcoin secure when 50 BTC was released and the price per BTC was 1 dollar or when it was 50 dollars was it secure then? It use to be 1200 dollars. 
The price per BTC is also very very relevant. Maybe a increase in the block size make more people use bitcoin and the value per BTC is 10,000. So it is very possible that even with the BTC having we cold be rewarding miners with more value with only 12.50 btc.
And also if the blocks were allowed to be 4 Mbs the miners can set a minimum fee they will accept to put in a block and blocks can still be only 1Mb. Increasing the block size limit does not mean the blocks will be full that is up to the miners. Miners can simply say we won't accept transactions with less then 75 cent fee if they want. It's all up to them.
Edit: also when this network was created by satoshi he stated the fess would be very small but there will be millions of transactions so that's how the miners would get paid.
Core team says there will be large transaction fees and very few transactions on chain.

Bitcoin solves a current problem so it is not a gamble in my opinion. IT is already working. 
I can only get 20% off amazon with crypto using purse.io
I can only buy drugs online with crypto,
I can only transfer money to anyone on the planet crypto,
I can only cross borders with millions of dollars with crypto,
These problems are being solved now. This is not a hypothesis.

The only time you can be spoofed is the first time you run a node. Then as soon as your node is up no exchanges accept  your coins. Then you know you are on the wrong chain.
The moment you are on the valid chain you can't be spoofed.

You would go with the economic majority of the nodes. For example I run a node does the store down the street except my Bitcoin? Do exchanges except my Bitcoin? The nodes have to agree in order for the bitcoins to be moved on a valid Bitcoin chain.

The circular economy is the most important. Thats what bitcoin has that no other alt coin does. How to measure that economy is hard but maybe the best way to measure it is to see what the bottom is after every bubble.

If I see a alt coin that has a circular economy like bitcoin I will probably start hedging my bets.

The problem is that if this is a usa crisis inflation is less likely to happen because usa is the reserve currency. There is not a currency more dynamic or secure to switch into. 
When people say the dollar is going to die they never say where people are going to move there money into. Bitcoin is not ready to take in that much capital.

It could be one miniute that is just not what Satoshi chose.

Google and apple would want to charge fees for processing the transactions. It would be better not to allow Google and apple to be middle men.
Also the micro transactions you get from Google are very limited you can only spend it in Google play store. Publishers will need the money to pay staff and operating cost.

1) gavin thinks it's better to communicate with the government and teach them how the technology works and how it can create jobs and oportunity. This community acts as if gavin has been bought by the government and try to take down bitcoin from the inside.
2) That is fair, people can vote with their bitcoin and support business that they like.  
I just think this community needs to realise that bitcoin will be used for good and bad things and this community should realize when this thing goes mainstream we will not even recognize bitcoin.

This is so strange, for someone who did not want any attention for 7 years he really is dragging this out for a long time. 
But he set down with Gavin and convinced him and says he has coins that will prove he is satoshi. That is a bold statement to make for a fake satoshi.
We should see some huge amount of bitcoin days destroyed if he is telling the truth.

Bitcoin is not political the people using bitcoin have a political agenda that they qant to use bitcoin for, that is a very big thing you need to understand. Bitcoin can be used as a political tool but bitcoin itself is not political.
If a couple corporations and the government can kill bitcoin then it was not built to last in the first place. You want to take down the most powerful government is the world and expect them not to fight back? (BTW I don't thing the government are currently fighting back at all)

This community is so political. It's so funny seeing everyone have a tantrum when business don't align with the majority of this community libertarian views. 
Bitcoin is a technology it does not belong libritarians, early adopters, r/bitcoin, or anyone else. Use bitcoin the way you want to use it and stop bashing companies who are trying to run a legal business.
You want bitcoin to take over the world, destroy governments, banks and liberate the next 6 billion. That's all fine and dandy but bitcoins Google, Facebook and other multi-billion dollar comapies that will be created because of this industry are going to play the long ball game and cooperate with the law, then lobby and buy our political and next thing you know bitcoin is mainstream.

No true for example lets say max block size is 100mb. The miners do not have to fill the blocks they can set a minimum fee that they want for all transaction. Lets say that minimum fee is 1mbtc and only 10% of transactions have that fee then the block size is only 10mb and the miners make there fee.
I like this better because then the miners have to compete with each other for what fees they are going to request to get into blocks.
