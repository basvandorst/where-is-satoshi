Really how do you know? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:31:35
I never said we don't need banks anywhere in my reply. But you make valid points. However Ill repeat myself for emphasis... btc banks defeat the purpose of a decentralized currency.  Keyword decentralized.  Sure get a loan from a bank but have you heard of salt coin?

Well regardless too late. What are you going to do start an uprising (to get rid of cameras)? You and what army?  It's too late they control it all. Also aside note do you just get creeped out by all cameras?  What makes you so shady that this spooks you?

 How does this work it seems like a scam? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:42:37
So get a cold wallet that you can keep in a safe?
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:40:46
You heard the man  
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:38:07
I mean a centralized alt is just a bank that's a normal person instead of someone with banking background(in my mind both can be greedy/ dishonest)? So the actual philosophical question is do we trust banks with money or a decentralized currency where everyone has control. While also keeping in mind that both are controlled by humans and humans are dishonest greedy and dysfunctional(2008 global market crash for example).... I guess what I'm trying to say is when are we going to get an AI run bank/ decentralized currency or  better yet AI run govt that is unbias and doesn't actually care about money?

I feel like this defeats the whole point/purpose of btc... But at least they don't have complete control of btc.
