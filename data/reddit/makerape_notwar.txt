FALSE.  ITS NOT ABOUT REPLACING.
\&gt; Bitcoin fails all practical tests of a practical currency: its value  flucutates too much; an overwhelming number of goods and services are  not priced in bitcoins, and Bitcoin is not a widely circulated currency.  
If a brain is used, all of these are expected for something so different and new as bitcoin.

Looks fantastic! I wonder though if there is a way to set it up inexpensively at home. Maybe print on a clear piece of plastic ? or use camera phone to overlay digital revealer on encrypted paper ?

What's your take on this drastic increase ?   
Because bitcoin is just to accessible ? Especially for online payment ?  
A lot of people have made money in btc ?  
A community that wants BTC to grow ?   
Something else ?   
lots of question marks...
