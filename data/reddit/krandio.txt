Why do I feel like Bitcoin is the next electric car. Great for the world, best intentions, around for 20 years, and still no one uses it.

Anyone's pool hash rate increase? I'm on slush's pool and it hasn't really changed, sitting around about 40 Ph/s.

Decentralized exchanges would be awesome.

It took a couple hours before I got denied on my first buy. Then it took another day for them to "check my account" I'm not really too sure what they had to do, but then I was able to buy instantly after that process finished.

I don't know how much power you are going to get out of a dorm room. Anyways, what ever miner you buy I wouldn't expect you to cover the cost of it for at least 6 months. Unless you get the miner for free. So after 4 months of mining you will still be negative. Assuming the price of Bitcoin stays around 400

When people say it isn't profitable I think they are talking about mining, small scale, at home or in a residential area where power costs more.  I believe mining is profitable on a large scale platform where power is cheap, or else the big miners wouldn't be mining anymore. So the big miners may be adding on to thier rigs.

.2 for 191 usd? You are a brave soul. May God be with you.

How long is the class? It's hard to take everything in when you are brand new to Bitcoin. I'm assuming the audience of your class is going to be people that have never heard of Bitcoin or maybe heard about it on the mainstream media?
If this is the case i would go in this order-
1)Introduction with brief history
2)How Bitcoin is made, technical or non technical
3)What makes Bitcoin good 
4)How it is currently distributed/Ways to get Bitcoin 
5)Give them Bitcoin if you can
6)Conclusion, talk a bit about Bitcoins future and future implementation, and get into other alt coins.
At least this is how I would do it. Good luck! I hope it turns out well!

I memorized my keys.

We should. They might steal all the Bitcoin from the Bitcoin database.

Poloniex is awesome. The troll box chat is interesting and fun to read. The day trading can be a bit boring at times. Not really a lot of action, but when there is action it gets crazy!

I agree. Do the basics on your spare time. Get familiar with computer networking, the command line, and simple scripts. Get familiar with the Bitcoin protocol, what is good and bad about it. Try to make this your own opinion and not from someone else and I think you will be good.

I agree. I live in Las Vegas and go gambling about twice a month.  The best casinos in the city aren't classified by their low house odds.  They are the best because of the experience they have to offer.  They have gorgeous, fast cocktail waitresses, with all you can drink alcohol.  You are with your best friends in the whole world.  You guys are on a mission to take the casino down.  You hardly ever leave the casino "breaking even" because what would be the point of even playing?  You either spend a couple hours where you win, or you spend how ever much time it took you to lose X amount.  The house has a decent advantage, but you hardly ever pay attention.  You are there to have fun.  It's all about the experience the casino has to offer.

I mine in my room for fun at 60 gh/s. I have been mining for a month now. I turned off my miner at some points so I can say I've mined for 21-26 days. I have made .00462btc in this time period. Since you have 1/3 my hash rate you would be getting 1/3 of what I get if you were to mine on the same pool as me. Which would be .001386btc in 21-26 days. If 1btc = 394$ Then .001386btc= 0.546$.  So 54 cents in a little over 3 weeks at today's current Btc price. Hope this helps you.

What's the conversion rate on this? I'm trying it right now and when I put in a buy its always in CAD. The Btc/USD exchange rate looks like it's at 518.51USD for 1 BTC and on most of the exchanges it's around 450
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:09:41
I think household mining is popular for the select few that believe 1btc will one day equal 10,000$. As for me, I'm in it to learn how mining works. Bitcoin can succeed and it can fail. If it fails then I'll be ready to jump on board the next coin like it.

"Allowed buyers to take back payments they’d made after walking out of shops, by simply pressing a button (if you aren’t aware of this “feature” that’s because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it)"
- Is this true? I want to buy/sell Bitcoin off of people and if they can take them back then that complicates things...

Where are you getting an s7 for 1k? I thought they were 2.4k.
I'm waiting for bit fury's product to come out. The halving will be interesting

Nice analysis! I've been doing faucets for a little while now and I wish I kept track of my stats.  The key thing I like to do is navigate through the faucet easy with a decent reward of 400+. If there is no reward listed I skip the faucet immediately. If it is below 400 I usually skip it as well, it just depends how easy it is to navigate. I'll usually save the good ones as my "trusted Bitcoin faucets" I'll run through those when I wake up and then try to find some more diamonds in the rough.  Going through faucets are tough, a lot of tricks to get you to click on ads. Thanks for the post and enlightenment!

Yeah. You can mine Bitcoin with cpu, gpu, or ASIC. The cpu/gpu isn't worth it at all. You have to go ASIC. Check out bitmain or antminer. Antminer has a series of miners you can choose from. So in order to set everything up you need: power, Internet(to connect to the network), and worker(this is what does the hashing algorithm). I  started mining with a U3 antminer connected to a raspberry pi 2. Totally not worth it but it helped me understand the process.
