@_date: 2018-08-24 09:53:56
Just HODL BTC ������
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:35:18
So, You saw all that in a dream? It came true after all. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:16:45
������ Idk what to say, You win.

Himalaya Mindcare along with Homeopathic Medicine called "Braino Life".
But I usually avoid bringing homeopathic talk as people don't believe in it.. Especially in West.
Works for me ����

Yes, It's true. I do think about money alot. I wasn't always like this but recently since past December.
When my parents told me that we are in huge debt as took a loan from bank and it will take 11 years to pay all that debt and there are other debts. We have total $100,000 of debt and believe me in my country that's alot. Middle class people in my country don't even think about taking that much of loan.
80% of our salary just goes into paying all that.
Along with that we need to arrange money for our sister's wedding in next 5 years.
So, maybe that's why I am dreaming all this.
Maybe I will make my next post related to this. Just for a reminder in future all the troubles I am going thru 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:34:25
First of all, I don't know how to Photoshop. All I know is how to crop pics and that I also do when I have to upload avatar. 
Secondly, I bought alot of sub from that site and am I regular customer. So I don't really understand how pissed someone can rise the PayPal fees...
Its not like PayPal asks 
"Are u pissed?" 
"Do u want revenge?" 
"Just increase the fee".. to ur hearts content. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:16:35
Thanks buddy, I hope ur dreams also come true,Specially related to Cryptos 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:25:10
I think BTC is a correction for all Fiat that existed for past 1000 years... 
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:27:16
How long since u had that dream? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:05:41
I only think about money when I have free time ������
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:53:05
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:42:35
Ok, Just for a little backup. Invest in mutual funds also. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:09:28
Thanks buddy, all this stuff taught me one thing. Invest early and learn to take/manage risk.  Hope u become millionaire and achieve financial freedom early. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:25:06
I am sure you saw BTC in there.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:19:59
Good thing I didn't charge anyone for telling the future. Maybe I should have ����
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:10:22
I HODL cause I believe.. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:59:15
Soon, My Child ��
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:14:22
I do know a thing or two about subconscious but believe me I wasn't expecting this.. Maybe I did tap into the BTC spirit. ������
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:39:46
You sure it was a kid? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:26:43
Didn't knew Dove also needed Helicopter to fly.
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:44:22
Looks like she's was born to HODL. You can see it in her eyes.. The power to HODL 
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:11:14
Is it a good thing? Or is BitMEX dragging BTC down instead of mooning? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:52:10
Actually, I pay him 2x the amount he gets from our neighbors cause he's an honest person. 
Although he's the only Binman in that area. 
He earns about $50 monthly just from our neighborhood. There are many more. 
Things in my city is a little bit different, Idk about other states.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:31:53
Whatever happens just get ur BTCs back.. Maybe it's life testing u, how far will u go to get them. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:37:33
Haha.. Nah But I believe in his prediction cause it sounds realistic. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 22:03:15
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:39:23
Believe me, I am trying. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:51:39
Yeah.. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:27:20
$6 is alot.
In my country:
 That's the amount we give to the "Newspaper Delivery Boy" for 3 months.
That's the amount we give to our "Garbage Man" for 2 months. 
That's I amount we give per day to Labours/Mason who build houses 
PayPal doesn't even see that in few countries that amount is very high.
I asked for a refund from a certain website and when they did PayPal just took $6. If I knew about this I would have bought another product instead of refund from the vendors website. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:18:01
Cents? I thought BTC uses Satoshi unit 
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:12:52
Awesome!! U selling those?

65% goes to bank and rest 15% goes to pay for paying for debt which my mom got by keeping her jewelleries at a jewelry store. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:05:38
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:50:10

@_date: 2018-08-23 01:36:42
Don't worry, I am not dissappointed by u at all. ��
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:00:22
Oh, really? Didn't knew that.. Can u explain how? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:38:02
I am willing to believe that.. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:24:06
Maybe ur dreams are communicating with you. It's amazing when u get these signals from dreams specially about Cryptos. Your dreams came true.
Now it's my turn to see if my dream about 60k comes true. If this happens believe me it would make me have more faith in myself, BTC and Cryptocurrency community. 
I do believe this is what universe wants " BTC adoption".. Crypto Revolution 
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:59:36
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:35:11
How long have u been in cryptos? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:54:43
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:41:21
People like to call that,but I call it Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:51:07
No, I am not its just that $6 is what I pay every 3 months to charge my prepaid mobile.
I mean if u pay $6 here then u get
90 days Validity 
1.5 GB of Internet Data(4G) Daily for 90 days
Unlimited Call in whole country.
and PayPal just charged like it was nothing. Didn't even tell me.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:15:30
You know I did read that people were going under Hypno therapy session cause they lost their private keys and the Hypnotist want 10%-20% of BTC if u ever managed to remember.
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:43:04
Dude, I am already awake. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:37:11
Thanks for reminding.I am now charging my mobile.��
It's 3 years old, bought in 2015. 
Is still in good condition and I am sure it will work till 2022.
I did remove useless apps and people now say my mobile is boring ����
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:53:10
If only it was a wallet also for  BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:11:59
Whatever China Bans...Buy It
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:45:58
Internet currencies will be more stable than Fiat..
I believe Fiat won't go anywhere as it has been for 1000s of years..Doesn't matter how much inflation happens BTC will be there and will help alot when Fiat currencies gets fucked up. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:31:57
Ok. I will try. I do think about money alot but not Cryptocurrency.. Not that much. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:39:08
Now, I am starting to believe that BTC spirit lives in "Metaphysical /Spiritual plane".. Its alive.
I will now take my  cryto-dreams seriously. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:38:53
