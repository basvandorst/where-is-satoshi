Hey thanks! I dig some of your designs. There was one design that bitcoinpride had with the btc logo made out of 0s and 1s I really liked but  this one and  this one are really cool. :)

Wow, I was completely unaware of anything like that. Thank you, I'll stick with slush.

I don't understand how to use Mt. Gox though, I never did, which is why I've avoided it.

I have a quality PSU in my PC right now and it's been mining for about a month straight. I also keep this PC really cool. But thank you, I had not considered maintenance.

Doesn't one need to have a verified Mt. Gox account for this? That takes a long time, doesn't it?

I see your point. I meant is it worth the effort. But I guess I've got nothing to lose.

**EDIT:** I'm stupid, this is a beta. I love this site though, so nice and clean.

No. Rest assured though, lesson learned.
