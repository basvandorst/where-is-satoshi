You can't be that retarded? The ONLY safe haven will be bitcoin? I'm not saying bitcoin doesn't have potential to be a safe haven. But gold and silver are safe havens and have been for milennia. If you think that only bitcoin will be a safe haven and gold and silver won't be, then your brain needs counseling.

Craptocurrency means nothing to anyone who isn't connected to the internet 24/7. it's just as fake and intangible as fiat. Who gives a fuck about the block chain? If there is a societal collapse and the power is intermittent because of massive shortages, the last thing anyone wants to see is some cocksucker with a smartphone holding it up and going "I'll give you some of this digital bullshit for real world food and water." I'd shoot the fucker on principle in a situation like that.﻿

Dude... in Venezuela where their currency has collapsed 1 single ounce of silver buys you 6 months worth of food on the black market and 1 ounce of gold buy you a home down there. 
You can go on YouTube right now and find starving Africans in Zimbabwe digging in riverbeds for gold and when they accumulate .1 gram of gold they can exchange it for a loaf of bread. Why can they do this? Because gold is money that's why.

And what happens when the currency crisis hits the dollar? So your argument is basically.... bitcoin is awesome, but they convert them to dollars, which is the entire reason people are (ignorantly) fleeing to bitcoin to get out of dollars. Doesn't make much sense at all.
Look, bitcoin cardano whatever, all potentially great. But you are playing with fire if you don't FiRST have even just a few ounces of gold and couple hundred ounces of silver. Which is REAL ACTUAL money.
