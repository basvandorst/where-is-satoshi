People treat it as a financial asset. Simply banning the exchange of it will scare away enough money to seriously hamper any growth.

What the actual fuck ������
You’re putting words in people’s mouths and talking like a fucking fanatic. 
Let me give you an example: 
Since you clearly oppose the removal of alex jones from these platforms you are CLEARLY a racist believer of conspiracy theories. I bet you hate the gays and Muslims too! 
So I hope you notice how you’re too stupid  to realize the idiocy of your argument. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:44:36
Well it appears you’ve been proven wrong. Try again. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:41:20
Are you also failing to understand that any and all companies have the right to enforce the terms of agreement we ALL agree to when signing up? 
Bakery doesn’t bake the cake? Go to a different bakery. 
Paypal doesn’t allow you on? Find a different payment gateway. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:50:51
Exactly what I was wondering... 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:43:04
Wtf? There are a million and one different payment gateways. Literally they are a dime a dozen. Stripe is another huge player.

Hey buddy where’d you get the tin foil hat? Stylish accessory these days. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:21:51
Really? That’s simply not true. Perhaps you should look at where bitcoin is being traded and held. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:08:12
The idiots who downvotes obvious sarcasm because they take it literally :/ 
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:16:53
God without /s people on reddit really fail to recognize sarcasm. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:54:10
Still makes you a dick though. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:06:35
I have no fucking clue I was just hoping it’d be something stupid that everyone glanced over �� I wouldn’t even know where to begin. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:16:59
Thank you, you’ve done an amazing thing and helped a lot of people. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:21:22
It’s supposedly hidden in plain sight. In my opinion the solution will be simpler than a lot of people are making it seem. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:52:13
Hey I remember when it was $130 a piece thinking “wow who buy this stuff...”
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:40:55
You predicted correctly as I predict that someone will win the lottery somewhere in the world this month. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:40:04
Wow top notch technical analysis right here ladies and gentlemen! You’re ready to write articles about this stuff.

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin' when I think of you
Dancin' is what clears my soul
Dancin' is what makes me whole
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:42:32
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:17:02
Why the fuck is this flared as misleading.......? Someone needs to fix that shit. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:29:15
It’s not always about “look at me” ... perhaps some people just enjoy driving a top of the line car? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:06:01
I like that thought process! Hahah
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:56:15
Head over the and start reading when you’re bored. Confused the hell out of me until I realized it was an attempt to mislead people into thinking BCH is bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:53:10
This is the kind of misinformation being purported over there. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:56:24
Hahaha. I went over there this morning and called them on their bs. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:03:58
I remember the 1200-&gt; 140 crash and thinking it was a bunch of silliness. Boy was I wrong.. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:57:24
is a shitshow. Never have I seen a more misleading, toxic, and overall low quality subreddit. The people there constantly like to over this sub, while claiming to be the real “bitcoin” and jerking each other off. I don’t follow any of this and knew something was off about that place the minute I looked at it. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:17:44
This is bizarre, I didn’t notice that at first. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:51:26
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:53:18
Very interesting! I notice this in interactions with people very often. Thank you for the insight. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:31:08
And I fucking sold yesterday :,) 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:03:20
I had tenants who rented one of our properties because their house got struck by lightning and burnt down. Leased while they were having it rebuilt. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:54:00
Flawed reasoning :/ it’s sad really.
