Ah. I must have seen (or heard, I forget if it was TV or radio) someone reading from the article or report. I remember distinctly it was $2.3T

Other "news" services being different how?

It was posted in several places, not just Fox...
It's mostly drivel. But then mostly drivel seems to be the norm for bitcoin "reporting" recently. I do wish people would take time to educate themselves on a subject before the opine on it.

No problem. :)
I could have gone with haughty rudeness or childish name calling, but instead I went with treating you like a human being by providing a link to where you could find some actually useful information.
Pay it forward.

...I believe the standard punch line is, "A good start."
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:04:55
Any evidence of that, or just speculation?
Not arguing the point, either way, just asking...

It's not Coinbase specific, but here's their announcement on how the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack affects their services

They cancelled my account because some douche on Dwolla reversed a payment. BX will not even acknowledge my support ticket to work it out.
I liked the set up of the exchange - but my experience with their customer service definitely sucks.

I think the gold uptick has more to do with stock market jitters than anything else. If it were bitcoin-related, I doubt we would also have seen the upward movement in gold mining stocks.

I'm a fan of paper wallets, myself.
Whatever you do, don't store it on-line. :)

I &lt;3 how one of the refutations shown of Schiff is a statement by the UN on the strength of the coming economy in 2014 and 2015. Lulz.
I'll stick with a 10% gold position as a hedge, thanks; and buy stocks with healthy P/E ratios and dividends. I'll leave the overvalued securities to the UN acolytes and other geniuses...

I have multiple paper wallets, each with a balance of 1 BTC. I have them all stored in one safe place, plus I have a digital (encrypted) copy of them on a thumb drive, in a separate safe place.
I'm using them primarily as an alternative to on-line wallets, since those are subject to compromise. I like keeping them small, so I can just sweep-and-spend them as I need to. 
Your strategy might differ, depending on what kind of risk you're trying to protect yourself from.

It is reversible, so it carries a higher risk to the seller.

Ugh... I was with him on that until he proposed the VAT as the best alternative.

There is freebay and litebay on the darknet. I, too, would prefer if there were something like them out in the open, but there's no rule against selling other stuff besides drugs and weapons etc, there.

Price is creeping up. Someone's optimistic about something.
(or it's being manipulated)

Yeah, I remember that. It was misspoken, and soon corrected to "$2.3 trillion." And it was based on a remark Rumsfeld made at the Pentagon in 2001.

Stop storing your coins on exchanges...

I don't think there's a "right" answer. I like paper because I'm old-fashioned that way...
To me, you don't really own it unless you can hold it. :)

Meh... The Fox regulars are certainly mostly right wing, but they do a much better job of bringing in guests with opposing views than MSNBC does.
Most of the Obama criticism I've seen on MSNBC is when he doesn't far enough to the left.
Either way, it doesn't bother me. I know folks get all foamy at the mouth about Fox. But who cares? They have an audience that they cater too just like any other network.
