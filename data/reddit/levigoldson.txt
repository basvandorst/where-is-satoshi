"not your keys, not your bitcoins"  popularly refers to letting other 3rd parties hold your coins in an account with the promise they'll transfer it to you when you want it.    For example if you buy bitcoin on a trading platform but just keep it there.     
Another way of thinking about it is if you can't access the private key and have to go through a third party then it adds an incredible amount of risk.    The only way you can avoid being separated from your bitcoin is securing it yourself and learning about what that entails.

If BTC becomes GST exempt it is pretty clear that that means:  if you buy bitcoin GST does not need to be collected by the merchant for the government.  That's how GST works in Singapore, and that's how every other GST exemption has been defined.   It's only ambiguous if you ignore all precedent and common way of communication that has been going on in Singapore since it's inception around GST.

You are creating a standard that is impossible that nobody who understands the situation ever claimed.
The idea of bitcoin not requiring trust is related to the monetary policy and the middleman the fiat represents.  It means both parties have to trust the government to do the transaction.
It isn’t describing the trust two parties trading must have.   That is required and common in any system.   And healthy, btw.

I agree, but not wanting the responsibility isn't the same as the claim that we need banks.
Not wanting the responsibility to cut your lawn doesn't mean you need a lawn care service.
The claim that we need banks is similar to the claim that it just can't be done without them, \*ever\*.    That's a very big claim.    It can already be done today with a lot of friction.  The friction will go down in the future.

Both Peter Schiff and Roubini have made predictions contrary to reality.  Instead of admitting they were wrong in the past, they just keep predicting they will be right eventually.   So basically, there's nothing bitcoin can achieve that they will admit it has been successful.   Even if bitcoin becomes a world currency they will still naysay it.   So yeah, these are not rational people.   I think they both have financially incentived bias.   
Schiff makes his money from gold -- which histroically has been pretty weak and has gotten wrecked by bitcoin in the last 10 years.    He look at gold and bitcoins as rivals.   
Roubini takes paychecks form banks and credit card companies.

It's like this, if I steal your car and it becomes a rare car 10 years later, the police won't consider the price appreciation.  They consider the value at the time of theft.   
Long story short, if someone steals and asset of yours from the legal perspective it's whatever the value of the asset is when it was stolen.    There may be civil law that allows you to sue for the value they deprived from you, but that's also an uphill battle and you need to know and prove exactly who it is you are dealing with.   Which usually means the police need to have established that for you, if they can.   They won't bother for $400.   In the case of crypto, they won't bother for $40,000 either.

I don't agree with you at all.   I'm not using the term socialist as an insult.   Most of my socialist friends who agree that they want the government to redistribute wealth.   It's not controversial that they believe this.   It's literally stated in almost every socialist political platform.
It's more like you claiming that capitalists don't actually believe in private wealth because you know a guy.
And honestly, I don't really care what you think -- as a fellow libertarian, albeit one without any self-ascribed socialist label attached to it,  I'm happy to say and express as I see fit.    I'm not changing my words to fit your narrow definition based on a label you want to use for yourself.    I've made it pretty clear that the people I am talking about are in fact the people who want to redistribute wealth, many of whom are socialists, and if you doubt that I can give you pages and pages of public people who are the most supported socialists who believe that.

Bitcoin wasn't designed to redistribute wealth.   It was designed to enforce monetary policy that can't be changed by a centralized power.      
If you're looking for SocialistCoin, bitcoin is not it.   In fact, most socialists love heavily controlling monetary policy as well as printing loads of it as a form of taxation -- or to raise money for government spending.   
If you're looking for NoCounterPartyRiskCoin then bitcoin is it.   Governments can't easily tamper with the monetary policy, nor can they stop you transacting.    
But you already knew all this -- presumably you're looking for a political platform to write an essay and lecture the rest of us on.   I don't see a single question or point of discussion offered.

I don't know if the trend will continue or not, but just about any model I use that isn't a human picking 3 specific points in time to make a bad judgment, gives the me an exponential limit function to the upside which has been a good predictor of tops for bitcoin over the last 10 years.

You're going to have a bad time trying to predict tops and bottoms in absolute terms.    But anyone disciplined can know when the market is euphoria vs pain.    Sell more in euphoria.  Buy more in pain.    Superior returns without needing to time anything.     
It may go lower, I'm not selling anything.  I'm just DCAing into dips more and slowing my buys in the run ups.   I've been doing this since about 2012.   I started doing it with 1% of my income over time.   Today I'm doing about 15%.    I have no idea what your risk appetite is like, but long term I believe any of these prices we've seen this year is a good buy.    It's just about optimizing your buy plan, and not wrecking yourself jumping with a weak hand selling into dips and managing to avoid the gains which are unpredictably volatile.

I think of gold as the original cryptocurrency.   Instead of its monetary policy being bound by math, it was bound by the law of nature that we observed in its rarity -- but there's nothing inherent about gold that gives it value.     The only value gold has, in my opinion, was a natural occurring material that tied a currency to a rarity that can be verified.   Bitcoin will be everything gold was but better and more rare, and in a thousnad years people will be giggling that primitive man thought gold was money,  the same way we giggle about our ancestors believing bones, shells, and shiny rocks were money.

I think no point in holding out hope about investigative work to save your bitcoin.   Sooner you accept it is lost and move on the better.    Spend that effort rebuilding -- whether or not you put it in bitcoin.   
Here's some real advice for someone who has hit rock bottom before.  I didn't do it with bitcoin, but it was similar and dumb any my own fault.  And it was probably even a lower point in my life than you are at.
You will recover.   Don't let this affect you.   You didn't lose the things that matter.    You overpaid for an expensive lesson that will serve you well for the rest of your life.    If this defines you in any way, let it define you by never being an easy target again.    You might be a target, as we all may be, but you won't be an easy one.
And one final thing, don't let this sour relationships in your life.   The damage to relationships this can cause through just attitude and perspective problems will be more than the money you lost.
All the best.

Halving their reward is halving the selling pressure.  And even if demand stays the same, that generates upward lift where it was stale.   And FOMO creates the extra demand.

The 24 words is to recover your hardware wallet if it's damaged or lost.  Write it down.  Put it in a safe place.  It's not to be used, generally speaking, any other time.   Your ledger can be protected by a pin.   The protection of physical ownership + pin is enough for most people.    Wallets containing $50 should be secured differently than wallets containing $5M.   Wallets intended to be touched often should be optimized for access with reasonable security.   Wallets that you touch once every 5 years on a long term investment can be optimized purely for security. 
You just need to familiarize with yourself with how the system works.
1. the owner of bitcoin in an address has a private key (think of it like a password that can be used to authenticate ownership of an address)
2. if you have that private key, you can transfer the bitcoin to another address.
3. private keys don't need to be stored in a hardware wallet, but it's scary if it's in a place easily accessible by software.
4. hardware wallets let you store it on a device and request signatures rather than the key be returned to the software.   This protects you since you can confirm on the device the way the software wants to use the private key.
Bitcoin is always in the cloud.   Once the system receives your transaction it will be processed.   Your PC is irrelevant.   ledgerlive is a nice little interface to access addresses and to sign transactions from your addresses.    As far as sending bitcoin from an exchange to your device, you just need to know one of your wallet addresses.   You don't even have to turn on your PC for that.   I have some written down.
Best practice is to generate a new address whenever you receive money -- it'll do that automatically in ledger live when you want to receive money there.   But old addresses work just fine.

If I'm not selling then how are they buying it?
There's always going to be hold outs.  There's always going to be people who forgot they even owned it.
Bitcoin will constantly be mined out for 100 more years.   They can't buy that, they can only drive up the price making mining more lucrative. 
The only thing that would happen is it would create a mad frenzy for central banks (and others) around the world to acquire bitcoin.   Driving the price to incredible highs.      No doubt, central banks could acquire plenty of it, but if their goal is to kill bitcoin it would do the opposite.   Especially if they effectively made the bitcoin in circulation far more rare.  
Basically, it's a nonsense idea.   It's more more feasible for bitcoin to be killed by governments buying up nodes and causing shenanigans.   Cheaper, easier, and reliable attack.    But every day that becomes more difficult to achieve.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:27:20
What a load of nonsense.    If nobody is willing to sell/trade the price simply would lack all discovery.

What is key isn't the supply is reducing, although that is important -- what is key is that almost all of the daily selling pressure comes from miners.   If miners were already hodling at high percentages, then this would make almost no difference except from a speculative point of view.  
But that isn't the case.  Unless something changes tremendously the price will go up when the supply halves.  We don't need to take leaps of faith about speculation on shifting demand.   We just need things to continue as it is today.

I think the days of investing 20 bucks and getting lambos is over, but that doesn't mean it isn't won't have great returns in the future.   Think of it as a piece of your investing portfolio -- and the place it exists in the "high risk, high returns" category.   That category should be a percentage of your investing overall.   Every person is going to have a different appetite there.  If you are young, I think it's a great time to take a shot with more of these types of investments.   I personally only allocate 15% of my investments to this category.

Not much anyone can do about it.  You could use the QR code, which I assume was the scammers bitcoin address they had you send it to, to track the btc.   If the scammer was dumb enough and if the authorities cared enough, they could probably track it to the perpif they ever KYC into an exchange.   If they're smart they won't ever do that.    And I doubt this is enough money that authorities would get involved to this level.

I can relate somewhat -- I mean, not about bitcoin (although I own some, it is about 15% of my inflow for investment), but I can relate in general.   As my income has gone up I've kept my living expenses about the same.   I just don't really care that much for stuff.   For me, investments is about security for my family, kids, and ability to do charity.   If I feel like I'm impulse buying something I often think,  what's the cost of money?  How much am I wasting over the next 20 years if I had just put it in the investment portfolio.

Laundering is a specific term to mean taking illegally obtained money and making it appear legal.     Not laundering.   No idea if this is illegal or not in some other way.  I have a feeling the most illegal thing here is this leak.

Bitcoin wasn't designed to stop all scams.   Just the ones perpetuated by the government and the types of attacks that can occur from the people who send you money.  AKA useless cheques, chargebacks, dirty money that gets seized or worse
Receiving scams will always exist.   AKA "I never received the funds.   Try sending again"
It also solves the authentication of money problem, which you may not realize, is a very big one.   Whether it's fiat or gold, fake notes/bars are passed off all the time.

Dumbest thing I've ever read.  
Literally the only thing driving bitcoin price is fundamental supply/demand economics.   People buying and selling and at what prices they will agree to do the deal, and how much volume pushes the price in one way or another.     So yes, reducing supply (as already proven over and over in previous halvings) will increase the price.

Oh?  You mean how do you transfer it to ***their*** bank?   I guess you sell it and instruct the exchange holding your fiat to do a bank transfer on your behalf to said bank.

You need to backup the individual seeds that create the authenticator entries into google auth.   Either the QR code or the number it represents.    You want to back those up in a safe place.
If you made the mistake of not doing that, you can usually just redo the authenticators for the services you use and back it up at that time.    I wouldn't advise using google auth without backing up those seeds. 
If all this sounds too much trouble, you can always use something like authy which is far less secure because of its reliance on cloud backup and/or telephony.

Sure, but it doesn't really matter what percentage of the bitcoin wealth distribution you are.
Millionaires might measure their wealth in fiat, but they don't hold a lot of fiat.  The average wealthy person has mostly property, stocks, instruments, etc.     Bitcoin won't change that even if it does displace fiat.   So in other words, bitcoin will never make their property worthless.  Bitcoin must validate their property for bitcoin to become valuable.   Otherwise people with tangible assets won't use bitcoin.   If bitcoin, as a market place, refuses to value these things bitcoin can never have a meaningful value.   It will never make their property worthless.  It just changes what they sell it for.     Bitcoin is never able to fully displace the world's wealth even in the most successful scenario.
So 0.2% of total world wealth in one bitcoin, the important thing you seem to be hinting at, is bullshit.    I am as bullish as they come -- but this is not possible and nonsense.

Bitcoins have never been confiscated.  They have been turned over.   That's a big difference.   The criminals that turn them over usually do because they are offered deals.    The large cases happen when employees of the criminal organization turn them over.   In rare cases, the government manages to steal the private key that was stored in an unsafe way, the same way a hacker might steal your bitcoin.

Since you are asking about investment portfolio I will assume you aren't looking to bet it all on black.
I started with about 1% of my investment inflows towards bitcoin in 2012.   I upped it to 15% by today.    I feel pretty good at that level.     Depends on your risk tolerance and what other investments you have.      Basically bitcoin is the most volatile/risky investment I hold.    I have another 15% in slightly less risky stuff, and 70% is stuff far more boring and conservative.
What I am trying to say is the actual dollar amount doesn't matter to me.   Not sure it should matter to you -- if it does, I would question if you are doing it right from a portfolio stand point.  
If you are trying to ask if $100 a month into bitcoin is ever getting you that lambo -- I have no idea.   If you think about it in terms of benchmarking against the rest of your investments then bitcoin will keep you a lot more sane.    Even with the down turns this year, even with holding through the 2018 crash,  btc has still outperformed everything else I'm holding.

The correct answer is it doesn't matter.   What matters is odds of it happening.  Even a remote chance makes it an important buy for the asymmetric opportunity.    And this is what is going to make it a self fulfilling prophecy for a store of value regardless of the adoption as a widespread replacement for traditional banking.
