No this is exactly why there will be many BTC millionaires. People panic and sell when its going down and those that are in for the long run pick them up. Only way to sell low is if someone are willing to buy them. And most people are looking to buy low :) But you are right! The people who have a lot of money to invest are making a lot more than everyone else but still.
For example Bob, he went in and bought 20 bitcoins a long time ago for a few hundred and have been selling high and buying low and a few days ago he sold his 35 bitcoins for $1200 and bought new ones for $700 and now have 60 bitcoins. 
When bitcoins reaches $2500 he will cash out before the next swing and pick up 150 bitcoin when it crashes down to $1k and so on.
I friends brother had one bitcoin a month or so back and he now has 7 from selling high and picking up cheap ones when people panic sell. If things continue like this and people make smart choices every time they sell high and buy low during "pop" they will almost double their investment. If you double your investment a couple of times like that you will end up with a pretty penny.
I honestly do not recall how many I had but it was more than a handfull of bitcoins but I formatted my hdd and lost it all a long time ago. As long as people don't do that or sell low they will end up making at least a small fortune.

I think we are just better off building a time machine, bring our superior hardware back to the start of bitcoin and hoard hundreds of thousands of bitcoins. Now if only the price on flux capacitors would drop... We could be dragons!

interesting, so if goxtool is not using their API how does it work? I think it would be very popular if someone made a website that worked the same way so it doesnt go down when mtgox servers crash.

ah sorry I thought it still worked once the API was completely down.

Question is, if it is so easy to make a profit why is the price so low? Why aren't they using it to mine themselves? clearly they would make a far larger profit than letting someone else take it?
But yeah could be they believe bitcoin is doomed but if they did would they have invested that much money into hardware? I just think its a bit shady really.

you sure that works? because earlier when the website was returning 502 all of the external graphs stopped reporting any sales.

Christ! Why aren't we doing that right now!
