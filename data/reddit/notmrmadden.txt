Do you have a 'vested interest' (as defined by the lawful right of an individual or entity to gain access to tangible or intangible property now or in the future.) in any organization or company with interests in bitcoin or "blockchain" technology?
Individual may be you or any of your close friends or associates with which you transact in any amount exceeding $200 USD on an annual basis. Entity could be any legal entity in which you have vested interests that carry over into the vested interests stipulated above.
Don't answer this, but it's something you should be asking yourself.

Can be updated? In theory?
Do you realize how many implementations are out there today? 
The update wasn't in demand by users. In fact, it was shunned. FSS was a worthy update perhaps, but not "opt in" FULL rfb. The blowback from the entire userbase of bitcoin backs my point and negates yours.
Are you seriously going to debate me on this? Wow. Ok, bring it.

If we have evidence? Compare every other Bitcoin forum to Notice different dialogue? Why don't insanely popular post in forums with 10% of the membership but 2x the upvotes never appear on at all? Why do the authors post screenshots of the posts removed?

How do I "opt out" as a receiver?
You won't answer this. If you do, enjoy what's coming to you.

Wow. I feel so much bett... Oh, wait. Nope. Doesn't look fixed. [Look full blocks.](

ATTENTION REDDIT ADMINISTRATORS: I AM BLATANTLY VIOLATING YOUR 'POLICIES'.
That said, this path tests out and is more efficient than presented solutions. Why would we not pursue this direction, short of investor influence?
Waiting a rational, non-political response with bated breath.
Not at all kidding.

This just cost us dev. hours and a week of work on our exchange. Opt in for the sender =/ the receiver. This breaks 0 confirmation if you don't do development work to filter RFB transactions!
My question is, who asked for this, why wasn't there any discussion, and why was this released on black friday when 9k transactions are backed up?
Unbelievable.

[Why am I always seeing full blocks everytime I check a block explorer?](
Hal Finney never advocated that a VC backed company should be a layer over bitcoin, and that we should cap bitcoin's growth.

Sure, I'll bite. 
Why didn't FSS get implemented which at least prevents double spending risk. Instead we got Full RFB, which means we now have to code to screen RFB transactions, or, if we're lazy, we get scammed.
So why was this controversial PR prioritized and merged over ANY BIP that would increase the blocksize on Black Friday when there were over 9,000 transactions stuck in backlog?

Of course it affects normal payments. 
How do I opt-out as the receiver? I can't. Now I'm at risk of getting scammed as a merchant if my software doesn't screen RFB transactions.
And maybe I just want to put a fixed bitcoin QR code and take payments or do something low tech?
I can't now, that part of bitcoin is destroyed because of this merged PR. The sender can "full RFB" a double spend as long as he or she does it before the next block.
Pure garbage. This should never have been merged. It's a double spend vulnerability.
