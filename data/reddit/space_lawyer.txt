you should read the bitcoin documentation

? I dont understand how your question relates to "you should read the bitcoin documentation?"
This has nothing to do with how silkroad pays for itself. It refers to the crypto involved in bitcoin transactions. Your question, "And how would this help the "silk road" pay for landlords, suppliers, gas, postage, local police bribes, car insurance, etc?" shows no understanding of how TOR, BITCOIN or the open source encryption involved works. The answer is it does not affect how the "silk road" pays for anything. Why are we even talking about police bribes (WTF?) , postage, gas or even car insurance (what?) ?

SilkRoad isnt a money making venture. it is a venue that connects buyers and sellers. the same goes for craigslist. the only way the authorities can find you from craigslist is through your ip and TOR takes care of that when using silkroad. the bitcoins you use to pay for the drugs go to the people you buy them from. I dont understand why you have such a problem with this- the currency has no intrinsic value, but it is understood to be secure.
