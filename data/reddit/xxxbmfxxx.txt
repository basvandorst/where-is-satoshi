I'm not thinking it should be but, read that coinbase was treating all wd's as sales or taxable events. Or the IRS was. It comes up as a transfer in gdax when I look but, so do my transfers to Binance.  I'll ave to see what it looks like on bitcoin.tax for 2018.
If coinbase reports to the IRS or gives me a 1099 for 2018 for making over 20k in gains, I'm wondering if the numbers dont jive which can draw and audit.
I really am not sure what i'm talking about and I'm tired but just trying to figure out how to keep records now vs. trying to figure out a million trade come next year.

So one complete transaction is “ selling the btc for current exchange value at the time of wd.  Second transaction is the same “ sold” cost basis divided by the number of whatever im buying? So that would give my xrbs a cost basis above what the usd value of the second exchange but i guess is ok when i sell those as the cost basis will be higher. 
Thanks for the reply, this is putting the brakes on trading pretty hard for those not making enough to deal with tracking it so acutely. Wondering if that was an ulterior motive behind such a shitty rule or just lack of care and/ or understanding.

First thing I think when I see that someone bought a dog.  Puppy mills should be illegal asf. i think people who run them should have their fucking legs broken if they know what they are doing.  Its sad but I doubt the dog owner knew this and once the dogs are bred they still need a home.  I am happy to see all the comments that so many people know how fucked up puppy mills are.  Its a start I suppose.

You should just stay away from btc then.  When it flies up in a couple months, youll be swearing at everyone too because you dumped it.

If this is no BS which it sounds like it isnt.  Many people in the world can learn how to be a decent human being from you. 
I have pegged to get myself out of my business in the next 2 years, pay off my few debts, donate the rest of my valuable inventory to charities and stop working for money for the rest of my life. No lambos here, just getting out of the craziness that we all have to participate in for decades on end. Cryptos may make that happen sooner and it will take far less than 85 million.
You're the first person Ive seen who isnt just being a rich turd from digital curency.  If you like animals there are some amazing charities and rescuers who arent top heavy.
Thanks, restoring a tiny bit of faith in humanity without having to compete for the richest person title!

Theyre taking credit for bitcoins runup from 10k. Its not bitcoins popularity, its the futures that brought the price up. Bitcoin was apparently not legitimate. This time next year, Wall street will be taking all the credit for bitcoins success.
"Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over $17,000 on Thursday before retreating"
"Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin "legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade".

What do you mean? That btc only went up from 700 because cb started allowing ccs?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:52:14
Also unable to buy btc at 14 &amp; 15. Anytime there are any lows, cb crashes so your stuck not buying or buying at recovery. Hapapned to me more than once. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:45
Im hodling, I wasnt even thinking about selling! I was trying to buy more but losing faith in the place where we trade/buy/hodl is crazy. 
Its insane that im sitting here throwing my money at gdax/cb and they wouldnt fucking take it until the price was up. Did they beef it up 10% since the last shitstorm? Some other exchange is gonna get alot more biz from shit like this. I literally lost money multiple times on not being able to buy the lows. Not because I panic sold.

The 1% that worked hard is a joke. A few people work hard, most are born into it, or land where luck and work intersect. By working hard if you mean taking shit from the public that should belong to the public, paying some corrupt "lawmakers" to allow you to own that public asset, when noone but you wants that. Then yeah the 1% should own everything. 
Also if you look at 25 year olds as clueless idiots, instead of a generation fucked over by their parents not fighting for any sort of future and fake new car values, your a clueless idiot. I'm not in that age group either. 
Great that your first reddit post on this acct at least, is to stick up for poor deserving billionaires and shit on a whole generation that was dealt a fucked up hand. That speaks volumes.

Happy to see how many people are aware of how nasty puppy mills are. They should all be fucking illegal. There are so many dogs that need homes and the mutts are the best. Its a brand name dog that gets you a dog with all kinds of problems and how many dogs are abused and neglected.  
The person who bought the dog, now knowing should still love the shit out of their dog and now that they know, donate some money or time to closing puppy mills or homing rescues.

I know it made it easier but the limit is silly. Its like 1250/2500 and 4% fee so I think only noobs do it or in an energency like the buying moments ago where people were using on hand/plus ach/ plus that piddly cc amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:32:32
Yep, this happened last time. Ive tried buying at the low hella low and I could not do shit. As soon as the price goes up, all is well.  Actually had gdax and cb open side by side and when buying with cb, the price was $200 higher than what gdax was saying. So after missing the 14's, 15's, started working in the 16's. I would force an order cb after multiple attempts and it would be $200 higher, pre fees than gdax refreshed right there. It was one shit thing after another shit thing.

No theyre not, that was dropped coins and hype/pump becasue those holding all the bch are calling the shots and knew this was happening.  Ive been kinda neutral on the politics of this whole thing whether some people seem like dbags or not.  Thats changing quick, I bet for a lot of people  
That sell wall for bch is 93 million and counting. Everyone will dump, put into btc and the insiders will make a fortune dumping theirs and buying it back cheap.

@_date: 2017-11-26 23:36:46
I didnt say that but, your idea that shitty man can exist on their merits with no interference or government is complete bullshit.  Makes my flat face fall look standing proud.   
I dont beleive this country has had good government for a very long time. And even then greedy fucks were always stealing from the public trust. FDR, JFK would have been. That doesnt mean we dont try.
I do know that this whole no government idea is good propaganda for the companies that benefit from deregulation. Corporations are complete psychopaths and will never do anything for the benefit of us all out of the goodness of their hearts because they have no hearts, literally.  Its a collection of assholes money where the asshole feels as though they arent doing the damage and their conscious is clear because they are just investing. We have no government for the people and need that. having no government at all just means those with the resources will take what they want by force. Right now their middlemen are congress, judges, police, and the very organizations that are supposed tobe protecting us.  
Its all fine for people liuke you to say all government is bad but when your water supply is poisoned, then you want government to step in.  
Your basically buy the Ted Cruz bullshit that big bad washington is to blame, which he is a corrupt part of.  He voted to give no aid to Sandy victims but changed his tune when Texas had the floods. 
Real government would insure that both were taken care of out of the public trust and assholes like him and 99% of these pricks go nowhere near governance. 
We would be worse with zero government, we need to kick everyone out, money out of politics, healthcare for everyone. Then we can all pursue a decent life without constantly being fucked over. But we need protections in place.
The theory of less government would mean there would be zero protections against the psychos with the most money. Were pretty close to that now but we shouldnt want to abolish it all, its needed when this country has 350million different people. 10 people cant agree on where to go to eat, 350 million cant agree on shit so the basic rights should be enforced. 
Completely get rid of lobbyists, fuck, hang them all in the public square &amp; get rid of private insurance and companies that exist only to profit off of misery. I'm not sure how to do that but zero gov is not the answer, so we agree that almost all is bad but,its the people who rig and rob their way in which is the dems and republicans alike. 
Work for a government that doesnt interfere in your personal life unless your screwing someone else over.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:46:45
And by gov control, you mean corporate control unless corps get kicked out which isnt happening in the immediate future. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:25:38
Government is only bad when the wrong people run it, like now and pretty much the last few decades, not in and of itself. Net neutrality is necessary to keep the truths afloat and there is no hope for anyone but the corporations. I never understand how people rail against government itself vs the shitheals who stole and bought their way there. With 8 billion selfish humans on the planet, we need government that represents the people or else we kill each other for dumb shit. Not corporate government, not hegemoneus government. 
Market competition in theory is a good thing but in fact, it is only competition between a few shitheals that will sell your skin for a dime. 
That libertarian uber freemarket argument is only a theory. There is no competition or checks and balances presently and those who are the worst corporate criminals have people arguing for them with no facts to back it up. 
Some people cant tell the difference between academic theory and fact.

It was time to send a message and move out of bofa a long time ago because they are a $hit company headed by garbage people.  You can actually use their CC and pay it off monthly and reap rewards. If you can play the credit card game, you never pay 1cent in fees or interest but you pull out $1000's every year. If you pay for "good" credit cards and spend alot or use for business, you can make more money and perks Thats taking money from the banks instead of giving it. Theres probably a reddit sub on it.

Thanks, I didnt see anything earlier and I know it will evolve/devolve.  
I wouldnt try to keep track of between currencies and exchanges but something like buying 3btc, selling 3 btc, should be easy enough. Although it doesnt always work out like were expecting it to.
