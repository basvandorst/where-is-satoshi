No risk in terms of double spend attacks. BCH transactions are safe to be considered as gone through with 0 confirmations. Thats not the case with BTC cause Core decided to drop that feature.
All cryptos are object of price volatility. The price risk is even higher with BTC because it takes longer till an transaction gets confirmed (full mempool) and the other reason mentioned above. Typically merchants use services like Coinbase to make sure they get the equivalent fiat amount. 
Some days ago a shopping order of mine got rejected because BTC received not early enough .... I paid like 5 USD fees, the refund transaction had very low fees so it got stuck in the mempool for days. I decided to use pushtx.btc.com to accelerate my tx for 70 USD paid bitcoin cash (cause I needed the money.)  the BCH order went through instantly but I still waited for hours till I got my BTC back.   Can you imagine how frustrating that is when you know BTC was working like a Charme in the early days?
By connecting the dots there is no other conclusion that all this stuff happens to push the users to second layer solutions to make Blockstream profit from it.

I just speak out the truth.

I tell you. Everyone who got early into BTC is shocked what a shitcoin it has become. Do you remember Bitcoin in 2013? Very low fees and almost no risk for accepting 0-confirmation transactions. That’s what Bitcoin Cash represents today (that’s a fact!).
Besides of that every BTC Hodler got BCH, it was a totally fair fork ...
