Evercoin is awesome, link your bank and deposit. I also really like CashApp, you link your debit card and purchase an amount instantly, however I recommend finding a better wallet because cashapp doesn’t give you your private keys so it’s not as safe as a wallet in which your private keys are given to ypu

Download an app like Evercoin, Abra or Infinito Wallet. These are all wallets that allow you to exchange any currency for any currency. Evercoin and Abra both allow for bank transfers too. The difference between these wallets and an exchange service like Coinbase is safety. On the wallet listed above, you store your private keys on your phone. Meaning no one can steal your crypto or wallet without access to these private keys. Coinbase stores private keys on their server, and they’ve been hacked. 
As far as the bank in relation to your purchases... it’s not something you need to worry about now. They can’t stop you so long as your not buying it with a credit card (most banks and credit providers don’t allow for crypto purchases for a number of reasons). 
When you decide to sell, profit is taxed as property as of now. But the way I get around that is (I use the Evercoin wallet) and whenever I decide my profit is what I want it to be (I don’t usually sell) but when I do, I sell it into US dollar coin and for now, it’s impossible to tax.

Easy sailing is for people who want easy money. The lower it goes, the more you can buy. I’ve endured quite a bit and I’m at the point where no matter how low the price goes, price doesn’t matter. Bitcoin changes everything. Bitcoin scares banks and financial institutions. It’s too late for it to die. If it were to die it would be dead by now.

Can someone explain to me how this works??

I keep 60% of my savings in Bitcoin and the other 40% in a stablecoin, easily converted to bitcoin or into bank if necessary. I don’t have a savings account, I have a checking where my paychecks go just to be removed for my savings and investments.

Bitcoin won’t break, there’s no need to worry. However I understand why you are worrying. It may take a while but as long as you put the correct BTC address in and your transaction passes the “test”, it will always get where it’s going, never fail.
