I urge you to sell at least half of those coins, and make the fund backed by dollars. Those charities will sell anyways, and this way you can ensure your legacy will remain even if the bubble pops

same reason you don't keep all your money under your mattress 
added security and added convenience(plus I'm sure banks will eventually add a straight to fiat exchange within the actual banking website), so you'd login into Chase, convert $1,000 worth of crypto to cash and send it to pay bills. 
They'll probably charge you a 5% fee for the convenience of not having to deal with sending money to/from exchanges

I feel like tipping in this subreddit is a bit forced. People aren't tipping because they want to, they are tipping because guys are tipping, so that means we gotta do it too. 
What's interesting is that tips tend to be around ~10 cent mark(with lots in the 40-50 cent range)....while the tips you see here are in the &lt;1 cent range. 
You can't force this...this is a completely different mindset between the 2 groups because Dogecoin is cheap and fun, while Bitcoin is the serious investment.

how do you explain that they have a similar amount of "users here now" as 606 vs 829
Litecoin by comparison has 27

my guess is that eventually they'll copy coinbase and allow an instant buy/sell for merchants. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:05:59
my guess is that they'll treat it like sending money with paypal from your bank account 
so this way they'll still get to take their fees from the receiving end and stay relevant.

I looked through a few pages of  and the average is a lot higher than that(granted, they do a lot of giveaways...so that skews the numbers a bit)

True, now please point me in the direction of a single major company that has started to accept bitcoin for payments in the last 2 years. We went from trying to get retailers on board to just having people use credit cards that pay with fiat that you can then pay with BTC. 
The dirty little secret is that no one actually spends bitcoin. I offered a 10% discount with one of my businesses to anyone who'd pay with bitcoin, it's prominently featured on the checkout page, yet I haven't had a single taker in the past 3 years and that's a business that does 10,000+ transactions a year 
So no, Bitcoin isn't a currency anymore, these days it's just an investment instrument like TSLA.

it's 45 million dollars, if legally you can get that money by exploiting a bunch of poor suckers...you'd be an idiot not to take it. 
if it's legal, do it

at current prices they are mining at less profit
this just shows that they don't plan for the price to stay this low, and that they expect the price to go up
BCH doesn't have the same order books as BTC. They can pump it 300% for the cost of pumping BTC 10%.
i.e. look at the current book on BFX. 
to go up 10%, would bring us to $5,060. There are 6,800 BTC available for sale until that price point. So thats $30 mil to go up 10%
that same amount, would pump the price of BCH north of $2,000.
So yes, at $600 they are mining at a loss...but the sell side is so thin on BCH, that even a single pump would make their BCH much much more profitable than mining BTC.

why are you assigning some nefarious plot to basic human conditioning? 
there is no Illuminati trying to destroy Bitcoin, what you are seeing now is what happens when a bunch of nerds get lucky and strike it rich off magic beans, get a taste of the good life, then decide that their current wealth is due to their inherent genius and not luck, which in turns means each and everyone one of them is smarter than the rest, and everyone should obviously follow their vision.
And its not just Roger Ver either:
case in point: 
Satoshi must be spinning in his hibernation chamber, and he is going to wreck so much shit when he gets woken up on January 3rd, 2019 from his slumber.

sure why not 
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:38:26
who else expected this: 
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:25:26
and tomorrow it'll be up 10% 
and the day after that it'll "only" be down 10%
and the day after that it'll be down an extra 10%, at which point might as well keep buying since it can't go any lower
this is crypto...this shit never lasts 1 day. There are multiple legs down to make sure everyone bleeds

that was added back when Bitcoin was going to be a currency that would take down Visa. Now we are all about being a store of value

what kind of financial services website doesn't have HTTPS on their website? What are you retarded?
BTW lol at this blog post: 
this guy looks super miserable about joining your company
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:21:22
ok, let say you bought ETH at ATH($420)
that means you would have been buying all in at $210
except the price went down to $130 after that and it took a month for it to bounce back above that point...and the only reason it did was because BTC went on a run of a lifetime. 
there is no higher coin than BTC that might start the reversal

it is aliens
how do you bring a backward planet to the interstellar market? all the shit they make is worthless, and can be replicated easily. Their fake money? Just paper on the interstallar market. Gold/Diamonds etc? We have plenty of that shit in asteroids
So you create Bitcoin and slowly switch them over to it, so that when you reveal yourself to them, their economy continues kicking because Bitcoin will be accepted interstallarly. 
That's if they are good aliens.
If they are bad aliens, switch the world to Bitcoin. Then when you are ready to invade, you switch 1 to 0...and watch the entire world economy crash. Here is a historical reenactment:

the real answer is never. 
BTC IS an investment, so there will never be the stability you speak off
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:32:18
you can't afford $60 for an SSL...yet you want to get into the financial services space? HAHAHAHHA
I don't give a fuck how poor you are, if $60 is anything more than totally don't give a fuck amount of money...you have no business starting a business in the financial services space. 
oh wait you are serious
let me guess, your ICO is going to be looking to raise millions of dollars too? 
did you dumbfucks even register with FINCEN yet? I bet you don't even know what that is. Just another bunch of opportunistic retards trying to get a piece of the pie before the hammer comes down and people start doing prison time for defrauding investors.
not to tell you how to run your shit, but holy fuck, get yourself a lawyer and make sure you dot your Is and cross your Ts. Otherwise, you better start watching some gay porn, so you can at least condition yourself to enjoy prison. I suggest starting out with tranny porn and working your way up.

should have used Monero

it varies, but its about $100 for half an hour, $150 for an hour

no way, early crypto nerds were a paranoid bunch, most most likely formatted their PCs before selling them. The only way any coins survived, was if someone's hard drive crashed and they just threw them away, although at this point I'd bet every single one of those harddrives got recycled already
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:20:19
probably costs $20 to make too
