Psst... he's not on our team...
Oh, and, by the way, he moderates this subreddit...

Let's send some lightning transactions. Pretend I'm a normally educated person. How do I do it?
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:00:44
I am still waiting for testing or a rational, quantitative argument that supports your hypothesis. You've been spreading a lot of fear and uncertainty as an "expert". Where is the evidence so the community can objectively critique it?

PLEASE SHOW TESTING ON MAINNET THAT SHOWS THERE IS ANY REASON TO BELIEVE LARGE BLOCKS WOULD EDGE OUT SMALLER MINERS WHEN THE COST OF RUNNING A NODE IS SUCH A TINY, INSIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE COST OF RUNNING ASICS.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

Ah yes, what? Anti-intellectual? Liar.
Try responding with actual research that shows centralization pressures with bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:58:01
Nice corpmercial, blockstream.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:53:57
Really? You have no financial stake in any company related to or threatened by Bitcoin? You are just here as a hobbyiest. 
I think you are lying.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:36:51
No, no I am not paid to post. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 10:57:44
Haha. I'm starting to like you. I'll respond to your post above. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:40:54
So I can have my side of the argument deleted if I'm making a strong case? 
No way. Not on this forum.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:31:08
This. Time to fork off the cancer and move on. I'm tired of reading their drivel.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:59:28
Sure, if their users are defined as blockstream's investors.

Long time bitcoiner here. 2010. Not a few rogue miners. We need to stop this bullshit about "l2 solutions" and stick to the white paper. Core is out of touch, and doesn't listen to users. They are tone deaf, rude, and have made it unpleasant to care about Bitcoin. I'm furious with them. It's long past time for a change. My 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:17:03
Can you describe this attack in full technical detail? I am unclear how they would "launch attacks that edge out other miners".
I would like to see full detail, including if this means increased orphan rates, what quantitative basis you have for publicly presenting this as a systemic risk.
Basically, please prove it conclusively, or at least demonstrate a reasonable level of evidence that this is a risk, and then I would like to see the community comment on it and agree, not just the standard list of echo chamber participants.
If you have a link to the study that isn't a bunch of posts similar to the above, this would help. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:17:23
We are not interested in what you are selling. That's not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:35:00
Read the whitepaper and quit taking money from blockstream. Your views will suddenly change.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:40:50
There is no scientific research proving what centralization pressure will occur with what blocksize looking at the protocol systemically, only research about hardware requirements. This is pure FUD. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 01:42:52
Pretty much this. The trick is to figure out which neckbeards started it and are the most toxic and... no never mind I have no  clue.
