Hard truth: it's just a matter of time before circle starts enforcing KYC/aml.

Then the loss of BTC is your choice.  There is no theft happening.
@_date: 2014-09-02 11:30:09
Yes.  As the number of people buying bitcoin increases and the overall volume increases, we will find stability.  The greater the adoption, the more stable it becomes.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:47:17
You really don't understand the concept of theft.  If I leave my laptop at a friends house, and refuse to come pick it up, that is NOT theft.
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:51:58
Yes, it is FUD.  You know how to get your BTC, you just refuse to do it.
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:07:14
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:34:06
When friedcat says "two weeks", you can bet on it.  Friedcat delivers.
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:51:11
So you're admitting they didn't steal your BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:49:24
Not in all cases, actually.  You can wire money overseas, essentially what this fellow did, and not be able to reverse the transaction.

If you think US imposed trade sanctions are the only thing stopping NK citizens from being exposed to the rest of the world....well, there's no point in having the discussion.
The trade sanctions are designed to stop profit of the NK government.  The only NK entity that actually deals with the non-NK world.  You know, the entity that puts it's own citizens into labor camps.  The entity that deliberately keeps the citizens in the dark.  The entity that bans things like cell phones and internet access for all but the political elite.
There are not NK businesses harmed by the trade sanctions, because the only businesses are govt businesses.  If you lift sanctions then you make the NK govt richer and stronger, not the common man.  In fact, you only make the NK govt look better in the eyes of the common NK citizen.
But yeah, whatever.

You did, though.  You accepted a deposit to a BTC wallet hosted by Coinbase.  It is well known that Coinbase is enforcing AML/KYC.  
So yes, you gave implied permission/consent by accepting a BTC deposit to a Coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:50:25
Not in all cases.  Money wired overseas would be exceptionally difficult to reverse.  Further, it's exceptionally easy to lose cash and never recover it.
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:56:48
I don't disagree with that at all.  The issue is that gold cakes is straight telling lies about "theft".  Further, given coinbase's known AML/KYC enforcement, why the hell would he have btc sent to a wallet he doesn't even control?
Goldcakes can get his 6 btc back.
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:31:09
Here you go with that "coinbase stole my btc" bullshit again.
Folks:  this genius didn't even buy his btc from coinbase.  He signed up and had btc sent to his coinbase wallet.  Now he can't withdraw the btc without getting verified with coinbase, which he refuses to do.  Einstein believes his irresponsibility and inaction constitutes theft by coinbase.
You did something really stupid goldcakes, and now you are piling the stupid on by refusing to retrieve your btc.  FUD.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:53:30
I knew your dumb ass would be here.
Coinbase did not steal goldcakes' BTC.  Goldcakes stupidly sent BTC to his unverified coinbase account and refuses to become verified.  Goldcakes calls his irresponsibility and puzzling inaction an act of thievery by coinbase.
Why the fuck are you accepting BTC to a wallet you don't control?! Please just shut up and go become verified and get your BTC back.

I'll give you this, its a very nice drawing.  However it removes all the humor, charm, and message of the original.  The original is great *because* it's terrible.  The original is art, this is just a nice drawing.

No financial system can save a person from their own ignorance.  The action was his fault, not the fault of BitCoin.

This isn't about popularity.  It's about potential danger to the bitcoin network.

There are short term solutions and long term solutions.  You are proposing a long term solution.  The short term solution is to make the community aware in order to hold Ghash accountable and move miners away from the pool.  Your long term solution is also a viable approach, but not fast enough.  
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:31:42
Are you guys serious?  This is an ad.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:49:23
No, you're immature for putting words in bitsforall's mouth and then accusing him of jerking it to fatty porn.
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:32:16
You do realize that by bitcoin's very nature, your transactions are public, correct?
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:33:01
If this is what you think, you are in for a series of rude awakenings.
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:30:48
Circle will too, just give it time.  Immature attitudes such as yours, so prevalent within the BTC community, are far more damaging.  You're being disingenuous.  
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:52:47
This coinbase circlejerk hate bullshit is tiresome.  If you don't like the service then don't use it.  They're not some nefarious organization out to fuck you over.  They ARE a financial institution who must exist within the reality of the legal framework of the United States.  If you cannot accept that, do not use them.  End of story.  Full stop.  Shut the fuck up.
NEWSFLASH DUMBSHITS:  If you pick up a snake, it just might fucking bite you!

Here we go again.  Buy high, sell low.  OP, if you were going to do something stupid like this, it would have been months ago, NOT in the midst of a rally.
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:58:55
You're having the wrong discussion. It's not about whether or not they "should", this is the reality of the legal framework in which coinbase exists.  If they wish to exist, they have no choice.
Go vote.  Change the system.  Quit bitching.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:16:26
"Question authority" does not equal "...the myth that voting changes anything".  
In fact, quite the opposite.  Questioning authority absolutely should be a tool of the voter, it should lead you to vote *more*.

After deciphering BTCe's abysmal API design I took all my BTC off the exchange.  If their trading API is such a mess, I can't fathom how horrific their exchange implementation is.
I'd bet everything on BTCe having been the victim of hacking in the past.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:26:02
Fix the API next, please.

Do you sleep through history class?  
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:19:11
Tell us the full story, what dumb thing did you do?  I noticed in your post history that you keep dodging this question.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:22:18
Why would that be the case?  Why would I want to deal with two different cryptocurrencies for handling different kinds of purchases?
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:26:20
You're right in that the feeling of 'having more' is valid.  I totally get that myself.  My Litecoin wallet certainly feels better to me on some weird level.
Edit: Though I would add that on flip side of your point, I feel like I've spent less when I spend BTC instead of LTC.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:38:28
That doesn't really make sense, perceived value demonstratively does not matter.  I don't make huge purchases in USD and small purchases in pesos.  Why would I bother to exchange BTC for LTC in order to make a specific purchase when the final value is the same?  I would just be adding an extra step for novelty.
Bitcoin or Litecoin alone are enough of a hassle already for most people.  Again, why in the world would the average person wish to go through the trouble of dealing in specific kinds of currencies for specific purchases?  Especially if we move to displaying Bitcoin values as bits?
You're underestimating just how lazy people actually are.  Let's be honest, LTC derives it's value from speculation in trade.  That's not a bad thing.

Rental cost is a part of it.
Though for me the biggest issue is dealing with the revolving door of tourists in my building who constantly party and treat our home as if it were a hotel.
We actually live our day to day lives here.  It's a tremendous nuisance to have your neighbor renting out their apartment to tourists who have absolutely no respect for the social contract required for living in such a building.
If my neighbor were a permanent resident and he had a habit of blasting music until 4am I could simply talk to him about it and we hopefully could reach a compromise.  When your neighbor changes every week, and most of them behave this way, what are you to do?  I see so many in this thread crying 'personal property rights!', what about my personal property rights?  We're not talking about single family homes separated by a yard.  We're talking 600sq ft apartments that share walls with 4-6 other apartments.  Respect your neighbors.

I've been buying and selling on coinbase weekly for months now and I've had 0 issues.  Reddit tends to make mountains out of molehills.

BTCGarden was operating in China, correct?  Then I say so because it's China.  To say otherwise is to be willfully ignorant of the progression of China as a nation.

Yes.  For-profit prisons have been working out exceptionally well.  For-profit Fire Departments are pretty sweet too: 
I'm already uncomfortable with the police having quotas.  I would be *extremely disturbed* by the police force becoming entirely profit motivated.  Because we all know that when it comes to turning a profit, theres no one more honest and trust worthy than a business, eh?
It's not that I think anarcho-capitalism == anarchy.  Rather, it's that it's the pipe dream of male adolescent first-world children.  History has already proven anarcho-capitalism wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:44:44
Yes, it does.  Much of NYC is comprised of tightly packed apartments.  Apartments that are filled with people who actually live and work here.
Do you understand how not fun it is to deal with your neighbor housing a revolving door of tourists who constantly party and treat your home as if its a hotel?  When we move into a building together, we enter into a social contract with one another.  A staunch belief in personal property rights does not actually grant you the right to behave however you please within the building.
