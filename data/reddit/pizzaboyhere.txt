Do u want to auto-convert your bitcoin to local currency or want to hold it as bitcoin ? In case u want to hold it as bitcoin, u need to integrate blockchain API.

Example please...

But, how ready are those solutions like lightning.network ? The reccent blockchain spam experiments showed that network is clogging up and a solution has to be there by the end of 2016.
I also have a Q here. Is there any limit for mempools to hold unconfirmed Tx ? Is there any chance that can be overflown ?
In any case, dont you think, raising a little limit and buying a few years of time could have been a better option than allowing this Hitler to take control of the hot seat ? His supporters are increasing -

@_date: 2015-06-13 23:30:49
After this statement from Hearn, GMaxwel and other anti-20MB core devs need to re-think about raising the limit and stop the fork at any cost. In no way, the control of Bitcoin should go in the hand of a dictator like this. I dont know how much control Gavin has on XT repo. It is better the rest of the core devs talk to Gavin and work together. This Hearn guy seems very dangerous. I doubt whether he holds any bitcoin anymore. It seems bitcoin holders are guinea pig to him.

It is a link from OCTOBER 7, 2014. Why is it trending now ?
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:52:26
Please correct me if I am wrong...
There are logic for/against the raise. But, probably, if a little raise (as 10mb is proposed by Chinese miners and Gavin said he is even happy with 8mb for now) is accepted, that wont stop the need of lightning.network, sidechains etc. over the long run. This would probably keep most of the bitcoin community together and keep Hearn type "Ignore the Longest Chain" dictators away.
Dont you think that this adjustment from both side is a better solution for the sake of the larger community interest ?
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:52:17
Good suggestion. Make sure the payment method is irreversible.

May we, the ordinary bitcoin holders, request Gavin, Gmaxwel and the rest of core dev team to stay together and work forward keeping this type of insanity away ? If you guys keep fighting like this and allow this type of element to creep in, price will go to hell. I mean, what is he talking about ? "Ignore the longest chain!" Hitler or what ?
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:21:27
In fact I'm already at loss with more than 8 BTC that I bought @ 950+. Unless, price goes up 4 times, I'm naturally losing. But, if this cloud mining can make 8 BTC to 32 BTC in one year or so, as their reports are indicating, then I have a chance to recover my loss.

If that is what your standard of logic, then face the fucking truth moron. We, the ad supporters, have done our job well and covered the internet with ads. It is your job to save yourself from us. We are killing and continue to kill all paid media. We will also continue to block the adblockers. You have three options. Go to paid media, remove adblockers or keep installing new adblockers and get virus infected eventually. And as long as bitches like you will walk on the face of earth, there will be publishers, who'll pour shitload of ads on viewers. Now, figure out, it is whose problem of survival... LoLz.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:13:57
These alternative models are being tested for some time now. None has been successful yet. You might like to tip with bitcoin, but 99% of the internet users wont. Even reddit, where we are discussing is powered by ad+donation model. Quality publishers will not throw annoying ads at you. Because, that would indirectly push their users away. In fact, now a days, Google SERP also get penalized for too many ads on a page. But, if you say completely no ads, then you must suggest a viable alternative model too.

There will still be contention in 2017. has already said that he is not agreeing anything above 1mb. Does it mean that 2mb will never come from Core and promise made to Chinese miners was false?

For that I need to know on what condition you accept double spent Tx. Could you please provide link of your service and list of those conditions?
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:29:26
No. But, it is your job to avoid a website that gives you annoying ad experience. That is how junk ad publishers are penalized and decent ad publishers are rewarded. Remember, your visit is their income. You are the judge here. And blocking ad altogether is like punishing the good guys for no offence and thereby inviting a paid internet, i.e. the wet dream of Rupert Murdoch.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:20:48
At the time of spam attack, nodes are already holding 20mb+ data in mempool. Hence, I fail to understand, how come doubling block size max cap will lead to centralization of node? Is there any rational explanation behind it?
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:34:22
If you can filter out obtrusive ads, then definitely go for it. I'm not aware of such adblocker though. I'm just saying that blocking ads altogether means inviting a paid internet, where Murdoch family will rule again.
@_date: 2016-03-29 16:43:28
I fail to understand how raising blocksize to 2mb would fail the bitcoin project in 2016, if they promised the Chinese miners to raise it to the same in 2017!
@_date: 2016-03-04 18:57:46
But, bitcoin can determine rising Tx fee. There is a proposal to use it as a variable to determine block size - [BIP 106 Proposal 2](

@_date: 2016-01-20 12:17:34
I'd say, we could avoid going into all these hassles just by raising the hard limit of core to 2mb and restring max tx size to 1mb. That is probably the best measure to stop this hostile takeover.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:23:33
Thankfully no. The ecosystem is mostly aware of that and has acknowledged their concern. Today, classic is winning because miners are supporting. But, we should not forget that miners did not support BIP 101. So, if there is an attempt to force feed BIP 101, there should be a resistance. And yes, the resistance is building up...

Why these 2 proposals are not getting BIP no. and added to github.com/bitcoin/bips ?
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:48:28
This is not a matter of personal disagreement. Neither assigning a BIP no. nor telling why it is not being assigned is a clear violation of BIP 0001. I wonder how BIP 100 &amp; BIP 102 got its no. Because there is no draft ready in Github for these BIPs in prescribed BIP format.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:04:17
I'd suggest to have one in English and one in Chinese.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:09:38
Proposals submitted by other dev outside of core devs are left without assigning BIP number to it.
While BIP 100 has got its number without following BIP 001. Total autocracy going on among core devs. They are determined to impose fake consensus  on their proposed proposal through scalingbitcoin.org. Long discussion on dev list is outright ignored...
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:42:18
Theoretically, mining will never finish. Only reward for finding block will be zero after 140 years. Block reward is halving every 4 years. If demand went up accordingly, it'd have been deflationary already. But, hype went up more than the demand. Hence the hyped deflation is now being corrected by real inflation.
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:49:39


True. I think, the solution you posted yesterday is the most scalable one.
i.e. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:08:54

@_date: 2015-08-15 11:43:44
How come ? The rate of supply is constant for 4 years and then halving down. Demand is not increasing in leaps &amp; bound and that is the problem.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:11:36
This is the best proposal I have seen in recent times. Personally I feel, Proposal 1 (only demand driven adjustment) goes well with XT, whereas Proposal 2 (demand driven adjustment alongside maintaining a fee market) goes well with core. It is good, if both proposal can be tested against historical data from block 1 (assuming max cap = 1mb) and see where max cap would stand today if this was applied from genesis block.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:11:31
What u have stated is good in theory. But, it is not happening practically.
Bitcoin is theoretically a deflationary currency, whose value is supposed to increase everyday. But, it is a free market asset as well. So, it is traded and its value is being played upon. Hence, in a certain period of time u can never predict how it'll act - a deflationary currency or an inflationary currency.
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:35:34
Apart from BIP 101, you may like to check BIP 1xx as well.

If u know Death&amp;Taxes on BitcoinTalk, he once told me that Satoshi was not a great coder. That is why protocol level rules are mixed with software architecture of bitcoin core, which needs to be dissociated.

No. Physical items that require to be shipped are safest. Gift cards bought fraudulently can not be used with such items, as by the time shipping takes place, fraud will be detected. So, the fraudster wont be able to run away with bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:34:16
That is how to write a BIP. It has nothing to do with constitution. I read the article tweeted. It has a clear directive about how can we prepare for hard fork.
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:50:50
Not recommended. Chance of fraud is very high. Gift cards can be bought using stolen credit cards, which takes 1-2 days for Amazon to detect. If the fraud converts it to bitcoin via LocalBitcoins.com, then buyer of the gift card will suffer.

First make sure that all BIPs related to block size are allowed to be presented at Scaling bitcoin Hong Kong. If that does not happen, it'd be pretty accurate to assume that Scaling bitcoin organizers are trying to play the central planning committee of bitcoin.

Philosophically, I like the concept of decentralization. But, decentralization gives unregulated playground to efficient people, who takes the system towards centralization. One option is to make it regulated, so that one can not have much power. But, then the regulatory body/rule setter (read core devs) become the centralized entity. Henceforth, the system must be such, so that if those efficient people tries to manipulate the system, that hurts them back due to lack of faith from other elements in the system. Fortunately, bitcoin works exactly that way. So, even when someone gets bigger than 51%, it is not a problem.

Unfortunately, this is not happening in reality. If you take the BIP example, only celebrity proposals are being discussed, while innovative proposals like BIP 105 &amp; BIP 106 are being subsided. Even at scaling bitcoin Montreal, which was not scheduled to discuss any BIP, Jeff Garzik almost gave a presentation of BIP 100. Not only that, BIP 100, BIP 102 &amp; BIP 103 did not even follow the formal BIP process, while they got BIP no. Sorry to say that, the core dev team has almost turned into a celebrity worship platform.

No one knows when it will shoot up or go down. If anyone claims to know this, he is blatantly lying. But, you can have strategy. What I used to tell people is as follows...
If you are attached with bitcoin, e.g. own a bitcoin business/developer etc., keep 10% of your total wealth into bitcoin. And if you are non-bitcoiner, but interested in it, keep 10% of your investable surplus into bitcoin. Do not sell bitcoin, spend it.

According to mathematics, 30x market cap means 30x more stability, which means BTC price movement should be 1/30x that of LTC.
But, mathematics =/= economics. There are psychology, politics and many other factors to be considered. Hence, mathematics might not always tell you the real story of economics. Hold your breath and the Bitcoin.

Once upon a time Ghash.IO kissed 51%. See where they are now. Mining is a long term game. Investing all at a time will yield a lot of bitcoin for the investor, but that would burn the capital fast, unless the price scales up. Anyone building a pool now would like to squeeze as much as bitcoin before 2020, the next to next halving. By then, 83% of the total bitcoins will be mined and then they would start to rip off the profit. So, in any case, big hash power holders wont bring in 51% or any other attack on the network that may destabilize the price. They wont do it for their own sake as they are highly invested. So, please keep calm and see how the game is unfolding. Satoshi was a genius ;)

It seems MS is still accepting BTC. Please update the thread title accordingly, so that it does not turn out to be a FUD.

Where are the talks of [BIP 105]( &amp; [BIP 106]( ? Did not Blockstream approve them ?

Small startups can not afford DDoS protected servers like the one used by BitcoinTalk, but they are still prone to DDoS. Its a trade-off, where CloudFlare is the chosen solution.

This is the unfortunate reality of most of the blockchain companies. Fortunately, investors are now conscious and not throwing much money into these hype.
