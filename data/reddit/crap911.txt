@_date: 2018-01-28 18:36:56
He already got hired by google. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:26:13
Lol joking but if he’s that talented I think google, Facebook will find him soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:19:36
Yes we are paying your weeds and your vacation by holding BTC right now. New comers pay for old investors. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:08:40
Money is never enough that’s why market recover every time it dips. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:10:22
First thing come to my mind is how much those coins worth? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:11:43
Everyone can do whatever they want. I don’t know why ppl spend their time to judge ? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:40
Whales don’t like hearing this ��
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:39:06
He wishes he wouldn’t know BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:33:30
I hope the price will go up according to segwit2x fork. But it seems that I am wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:49:01
Wirex a good app
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:02:24
Yes they are holding loads of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:34:36
Well, I shouldn’t say the price will drop. I mean the more ppl get to know BTC the better for cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:14:36
Bicoin is always bitcoin no matter what how many bitcoin clones out there. It has been become legend as the first crypto. BCH, segwit2x... are the first clones of BTC and will not be the last. For this reason I think bitcoin will long live. 
Ps: I do not own any bitcoin but I still believe it is the only king in this crypto world.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:35:00
FUD always come from China. Mean there are a lot chinese whales manipulating this market. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:28:31
So they will sell these bitcoins and the price will drop. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:39:34
Isn’t the writer of this article a Chinese woman? Well again news from 8btc. First was chinese tycoon gives up ok blockchain then sec shut down one crypto broker. What gonna be next? You guess the rest. Highly manipulated market, highly manipulated BTC. Sorry if I hurt someone’s feeling but this is what I have realized after being in crypto for a period of time. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:28:15
Shilling! Seeking for new victims to buy in then dump.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:54:50
It’s not profitable. I wouldn’t confirm transactions to get a few cents 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:30:28
Why ppl downvote this? Surely bag holders jobless 
@_date: 2018-05-26 09:20:22
Damn too many sheeps following this man and posting every of his tweets. Shame
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:32:01
It’s not true, they just love BTC because they are holding it. You don’t shill if you don’t own. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:25:28
Soon ppl buy their coins then will dump again at all time high. The cycle repeats itself. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:09:52
It’s not the surprise. Everyone knows BTC is highly manipulated since 1% of the BTC community own 99% BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:55:46
I’m a millionaire!!!
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:06:56
Why you didn’t post the pic me purchased pizza
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:59:52
Yes the move to the next dip. Every time BTC rises it will cause the market crash later. Just downvote me, whales! 
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:52:35
Coindesk = fake news. Just a pump and dump Channel of whales.

How big when they want India to buy their useless petro then use petro to pay for oil. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:41:32
Ok whales stop manipulating it won’t work. Btw does he have to repeat the same statement over the time? He might in a hurry to see the bubble burst before his time comes? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:56:39
Ppl are saying it’s too expensive to make BTC transactions. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:11:28
Yes just a shill and FUD game. They need to get more new victims because the old ones have been familiar with their strategies of pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:26:22
It’s impossible as you know BTC price increases every year, so 0.1 BTC might worth more in the next coming years. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:25:38
Yep was you the one who sold me the pizza? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:51:03
Will you eat your own di ck? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:32:44
From 2013 to 2014 grew 5 times and 2015 pulled back to a half of 2014. From 2016 to 2018 grew 10 times. 2019 pull back? But the current market is different from years ago. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:21:45
But the fact is many institutions, exchanges choosing BTC as the main coin. Rich ppl don’t care about slow or so cos they buy BTC to store their deflation fiat money. Why collectors paying millions for ancient stuffs like a broken vase ��. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 05:56:25
Lol now they are showing it that they do really control BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:04:21
They have petro coin but it doesn’t save them. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 05:55:40
Yes if they make sure that China doesn’t have any relationship to BTC. Because all know that there are 3 big mining pools that controls the most BTC in China.
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:15:32
And you are here in crypto? 
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:14:19
Cos it’s the first crypto so ppl always want it. It also has a cool name. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:11:09

Use wirex.
@_date: 2018-10-20 05:56:49
Everything you speculate and waiting for price to rise is pyramid scheme? So stocks, gold, houses, lands... are also pyramid scheme? Cryptocurrencies are like metals, some are rare, valuable like gold and some are cheap like iron depending on their usecases and the difficulty of producing.

Just downvote it! 
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:17:44
I don’t really care about icos anymore. There are thousands good project from last year. I will buy them instead. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:53:42
I made 1000 tweets about BTC every day. Should I stop ? ��
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:46:22
Not necessary. The person sold you his BTC might buy back from you. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 21:50:40
What is inside cockbox? What does it contain
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:36:31
Lol you are so funny. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:03:08
That’s why you should pick the most efficient one, which has real usecase and chance to be massively adopted. The world becoming tokenized word. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:20:26
That’s why their economic collapse. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:13:15
There are over 2000 coins atm and more to come but BTC position can’t be changed. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:07:15
How about scalability? What happen to xlm and litecoin when it seems that they are adopting lightning too. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 10:09:08
Yes it has always been the manipulation in this crypto market. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:49:41
No comments or I will get more downvotes from maximalists. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:16:59
Wait till it hits $12.5 and buy 10!
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:25:31
Lol who uses coinbase these days? Move to Wirex. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:37:41
No but I’m interested in your social media’s notifications more. Do you have tinder? 
@_date: 2018-10-27 04:51:17
No co ck hurt cos I know you are wrong. Crypto is here to stay so just stay there, watch and learn. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:53:45
Will suffer more when all BTC mined and lightning network is fully adopted? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:52:08
Lol it’s just a trick. Coinbase wants attention since many new exchanges are sharing their cryptocake. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:04:48
Don’t worry we will sell them these coins back. At higher prices. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:25:06
What an advice. Buy but we are still in beat market. Doesn’t this mean the price will go lower, so why I have to buy now? ��
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:55:08
The result of wanting money from black market. The result of wanting not to pay tax. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:07:28
Ok that’s the game. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:38:38
Your friends are highly educated and say don’t buy bitcoin. What is the point here. Lol does that mean ppl who buy BTC are not educated ��
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:44:12
People are making coinbase become big while it’s not anymore. Why I have to use coinbase while I have many thousands others better options. Coinbase is just a bump and dump exchange these days. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:56:51
No it’s not back by dollar some are but not all. Most are printed from thin air. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:41:15
Then sell the dips
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:42:59
We can’t you can’t. With our little money we hardly can do anything. Big players are the only one make decisions. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:50:46
OK 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:15:47
Institutions rumors might have started in 2013? But no me of them is showing up. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 12:15:41
She bought the dips. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 05:44:08
Almost no fee. But they have the spread between buy and sell if you want to sell your coins there after buying. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:45:58
If you are not lucky to be millionaire in one night, you have to be patience. If you can’t have both then should quit as soon as. It can take years before the market turns bullish again. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:10:45
Should be crypto. Bitcoin is not the only crypto these days. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:06:33
Then you will see much doubt here. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:52:54
Because your BTC are male and they need male BTC for their female BTC. They think they could get more BTC by this way. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:28:29
Nope it started in summer 2017. The continuous rise created FOMO and bring more people. The bullrun only happen after the continuous rise not after a big pump and dump. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:35:53
How much BTC for the man 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:04:11
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:52:58
We were said the same at every crash
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:37:46
Don’t click any links on the internet. That’s honest advice 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:40:25
And the potential to decrease 20% in a singe day
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:53:41
BTC doesn’t scam but the people behind it the manipulators pumping it for no reasons. Tether was printed to pump BTC and SEC is investigating this. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:36:07
Is this a sign that many ppl took profit from last year and already invested in something else. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:55:07
So I will sell my personal information for just $25? 
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:29:52
In this case Mcafee had better prediction then. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:05:15
Again? Why this exchange has too much FUD. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:02:31
It’s your money. Just wait for the next one to pay higher then one day you might have the same car if you are lucky in this gamble game. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:43:53
Tether doesn’t but the ppl created it. Why did they burn 500 millions tethers because they didn’t have enough. You can make fake BTC order with fake tether 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:25:51
Yes but whales control it and its worse 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:37:00
But mcafee said 1 million
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:37:09
If BTC goes 4x altcoins go 10x
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:24:42
The best talk ever. Sooner or later 
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:59:33
“Bitcoincash is the real bitcoin” ��
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:46:59
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:22:03
If you want to make FUD just put China and ban together. It works as always.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:33:41
The same thoughts have been for many years. The answer is no one knows. One thing I am sure is: it has always been like this: keep the market stable -&gt;sell-&gt;FUD-&gt; crash the market-&gt;buy at the bottom-&gt; release good news-&gt; sell at top then repeat. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:26:20
Btw happy wedding. You are lucky and your bro is a funny guy. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:43:50
Agree. He would never touch that $200k. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:32:50
Yes think of the one who buy at 1 million ��.
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:17:24
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:22:32
I invest but I don’t want to loose. That sentence: afford to loose is terrible it means crypto can go zero. If it goes zero why hold. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:52:15
No I will accumulate altcoins instead get more profit. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:42:39
I would do the same if I had $200k to invest. Ppl invest in crypto because they hope their lives will change. $200k is nothing for him but for someone $1 means a lot 
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:46:28
�� no dictator!
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:21:41
How many ppl shills BTC but don’t own ? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:24:55
Luckily that the market was stable during the last time.  Otherwise BTC price could be down or up 5-15% within hours. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:02:10
Yes he said as if he is a good man. We all know he is a mafia. Dictator of Russia. Who has been president for that many years, if not president then prime minister. Only change the role but the power of the control never out of his hands. Sorry Putin but I don’t believe you!
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:08:29
They are called anti fans.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:03
Don’t you mean it crashes to $3 again? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:46:55
It’s not fun at all man. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:23:22
Well technology is changing fast. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:51:49
Downvote these FUD post
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:53:29
Wirex 
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:14:04
Just another owner of BTC trying to boost the price then dump. Not interested in this kind of news anymore: this predicts BTC  $50k this year, that company accepts BTC etc, controlled coin. I have been here for a while and already see this. You gotta hate me but what I am saying is true. We feeding whales, old investors. Remember there is still very small group of ppl own 94% BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:54:23
That’s because those old investors already cashed out and new investors suffer. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:31:05
He is perfect 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:11:33
They need to crackdown their government! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:12:10
How many times I have to see this ? Is there a group of ppl spreading FUD ? No wonder!
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:14:19
How many BTC he is holding.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:53:02
Yes thinking the same and it works. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:27:07
Trump doesn’t like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:38:49
He s meant to spreading FUD? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:10:43
It’s time for media pump BTC then dump after that, like the way they did when it reached $20k for the first time. Media pump always work you can make load of profit by joining in time but remember to take profit before they dump you. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:22:13
How many ppl are there already to pay with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:14:23
Where are our BTC twins? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:31:25
Another shill for BTC, this is the way they earn profit by  getting more ppl buy high.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:39:54
New FUD! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:01:58
Sorry since the day I joined cryptocurrencies I have never seen any decentralization. All I see is greedy ppl trying to make their bags bigger by spreading FUD, hates etc. So for me decentralization is a lie which was created by bag holders to convince newbies to buy their coins. Downvote me if you agree. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:20:33
Because it’s highly manipulated 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:10:23

Is this the bubble guy that is about to burst?

They have the printer, don’t worry. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:40:39
They don’t wait but manipulating the price and buying the dips. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:51:22
Oh please Putin, unless you want America to destroy the whole cryptocurrencies with more regulations. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:54:01
How do you know. May not now but later when it hits $320k as they say. Pity ppl who gonna buy at $320k.
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:37:11
He has fuc ked all of his followers cows. Now it’s time to find new cows. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:41:14
So why they banned crypto if they are advanced? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:38:36
Despite of what they say, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Remember those ppl just try to manipulate the market they want to get more money even though they will leave the world behind very soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:24:28
To celebrate this event every holder should buy $1000 more BTC and hold! 
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:47:58
Where is Pakistan? Do they have internet there? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:02:00
Really ? How it’s still under control by big mining pools. Governments has no control but whales do have control then it’s worse. No difference when everything is controlled by the rich no matter where you are.

Yes and MTGOX is moving 16k BTC and bch from their cold wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:34:20
Have never seen any ppl who don’t own BTC say good thing about BTC. Mostly holders shilling their coins. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:08:07
Hold! 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:45:59
“Use bitcoin” the words “buy bitcoin” makes it become like something to speculate. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:37:54
they control BTC in China and now also in Canada 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:51:57
No it makes the poor become rich vice versa
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:19:10
Depends on in which way the world will treat it. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:56:17
You mean the ones are calling crypto is bubble? Well they are the ones to work for earlier buyers to produce food, and many others needs.
