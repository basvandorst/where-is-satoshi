So does that means that if they are enough full nodes, they are able to stop this hard fork from happening? Even if the miners are able to create the longer chain?

I don't think it will have anything to do with the core developers (or classic developers depending on how things develop). Correct me if I am wrong. They can just change a simple setting and get 51% of the miners to run the MOD version create the longer chain while invalidating the others. A hard fork. And alll user will be forced to follow the MOD chain.
So the answer is, Yes, inflation can happen. Correct?

You mean after the 'dogecoin printing', the price  did not depreciate? I would be surprised!

Sorry, wasn't following news and price from altcoinsss. So what happen to the price/confidence after the 'coin printing'?

That's exactly the question:
In such case, Miner will most likely support it and they have the power to implement it. Ordinary man on the street bitcoin holder, will have no say what so ever and accept the inflation? Even by running full node doesn't prevent it?

Agree. 
However, assume the situation when (Fee+Reward)&lt;operating cost. What would the the miner do? Just fold quietly or group together and..
If the price of bitcoin maintain 'high' enough, this will most probably not happen. Just a question of whether it can.
