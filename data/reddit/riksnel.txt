My miner wasn't able to switch to the new p2pool block fast enough, so on p2pool I got 30% less effective hashrate than on a centralized pool. 
Tot make p2pool useful, it could benefit from ideas presented by Bob McElrath, at Scaling Bitcoin in Hong Kong. It is a complicated reward scheme, that gets rid of orphans.

Clients could do it automatically (I don't know which clients can handle CLTV and how they do it), but the person should keep a backup of the raw transaction in all cases. If are unable to broadcast the transaction once it is valid, you lose access to the coins.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:44:25
Invalid transactions are dropped. Nodes do not care why it is invalid. A bad signature gets treated the same way as a failed CLTV. (because they are by the script, and the scripts returns 'false' if it fails)
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:53:05
Suppose you have a stash of bitcoin you don't touch.
Create a transaction from it to your family member that is valid only after a month (CLTV).
- if you die within this month, the family member gets the coin
- if you live: move the funds before the CLTV transaction becomes valid and repeat
If you forget to 'press' the switch, you lose control over the bitcoin...

IMHO, the price rise is caused by a shortage of BCH on the exchanges. There wasn't an influx of new BCH on the exchanges for 11 hours, because the last block was mined approx 11 hours ago. If I had any BCH on an echange, I would dump as soon as the next block is created.

It is possible to to use 'federated' sidechains. To do this, you must trust some majority of a federation of entitites to keep the bitcoins backing the tokens in the sidechain safe and pay the bitcoin back if you want it back.

GPU friendly = you may be able to make a profit.
Mining bitcoin (SHA256d) is pointless on a GPU, because ASICs are much faster. If you mine a coin for which there are no ASICs, you can mine more value.

In my view Tether is (like) a bank that purportedly holds USD in another bank and gives TetherUSD credit as tokens on the bitcoin blockchain (using the Omni Layer).
 I see are three main problems:
* Tether can't prove they are solvent
* The bank at which Tether purportedly keeps the USD may be failing
* Since Tether allows TetherUSD owners transact with eachother (without any KYC/AML stuff), regulators will kill it once it becomes to big
The argument in the article seems to amount to: Tethers are very useful to exchanges that do not deal with banks. Which is very true. But the fact that it is useful to keep trusthworthy dollar IOU's in the bitcoin blockain does not imply that TetherUSD is trustworthty.

This is good (with the F substituted for the E, which I missed...). Excactly one of these yields a correct Casacius private key. In the documentary the first few characters of the public key are revealed, they are '121EM15s'. They are consistent with the one I found.

It does not matter.
If we have a bitcoin flashcrash, the limit buy option buys bitcoin at a lower price and afterwards, the price recovers. In the same flashcrash a stop sell order sells BTC at a discount, after which the price recovers. So a stop sell order in a BTC flashcrash is ~~good~~ bad because it sells at a discount. (and a stop buy order won't be triggered)
The same can be said for a flashcrash upwards, but then about the limit sell order and the stop buy order. In this case the stop buy order buys at a premium, which is bad.
In both cases the stop orders are bad and the limit orders good (but only in a flashcrash; the price moves and moves back quickly).

Zerocoin is bloated, slow and impractical. The new thing is Zerocash, it seems competative to me.
Monero is really clever, and it currently works. I like the ring signatures, and public key images. But the anonyminity set is limited and the size of the signature scales linearly in the size of the anonimity set.
Zerocash always uses all txouts in the anonimity set. Since amounts are hidden, there is also no need for standard denominations.

The data that needs to be embedded in the blockchain of the parent chain (Bitcoin) is exactly 44 bytes, see the spec:
It allows for 2^31 -1 (signed 32-bit int max) auxiliary chains.
If you want people to mine your chain, you should ask them. (solo miners/pool operators). It is not easy to get a decent hashrate. DevCoin only gets 5% of the hashrate of the bitcoin network...

You can try to decrypt it with bitcoinpaperwallet, use it offline. It will give all information after decryption, if the public address matches then you can access the funds by sweeping the decrypted private key.
Edit: Maybe your problem is caused by the fact that, in bitcoin, every ECDSA private key has two public addresses and two wallet import formats (compressed and uncompressed). BIP38 accounts for this, but your implementation maybe not. With bitcoinpaperwallet you will get both.

Mining hardware will be useless anyway if SHA256 is broken. Bitcoin will only be useless if it does not switch to another POW.
Currenly mining hardware becomes obsolete pretty fast, so miners are used to it.
Your point about bitcoin becoming vulnerable is a good one. If there is only a CPU implementation, then CPU mining will become profitable again (for a short while). Hopefully, the total hashrate will be high enough to withstand botnets and such. I expect GPU/fpga/Asics to appear fast.

This would require a hashing speed of 1000x2^(17x4)/(365x24x60x60) H/s = 1.17x10^15 H/s. In turn you would need specialized hardware and a lot of electricity and be prohibitively expensive. Unless Sathoshi found some way to incentivize the world to build dedicated sha256 ASICs and give the data to him for free, there is no way he could win the bet.

someone seems to have done just this, very few people seem to pay attention to it:
Weak point is that only the message hash is given...
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:42:08
You make it sound like there are three people needed for the bet. Point 1 and 2 are the same. In addition, most people who make a bet have something up their sleeve.
Point 3 is true, but it doesn't have anything to do with the bet.

The professor probably means: what if Satoshi wants to use block solutions for other means?  For example: Satoshi has a bet with someone, that he can supply 100 pieces of data that hash to a value that strarts with a lot of zeroes... 
Edit: spelling and clarity

A lot can be optimized:
- storing blocks as headers and txids (put the txs in a DHT)
- do probabilistic verification (with fraud detection and broadcast) 
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:47:34
There's not much info about how it works. Serious hardware wallets have a display to verify the amount and destination address of a bitcoin transaction. How would bitstash do it? 
Bitstash uses a custom bitcoin client. Not easy to trust... (one of my reservations about trezor, fortunately electrum (git) now suports trezor too).
Edit: for spelling.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:13:31
I filled it out. It is a good thing that young people at school are interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:45:44
Yes, I run two nodes. Good idea. I've expanded the TODO.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:29:03
I think getting other manufacturers to produce miners is the most important thing. Unfortunately, the talk of POW-change may scare them away.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:10:26
You have SELL and HODL, but also BUY! So you HODL, and if you have the urge to SELL, you BUY (if you believe in bitcoin the long term).
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:30:15
Ah, I see wat you did. You pasted 
in the string field,
Then it will calculate the hash of
31 30 30 31 31 30 31 31 ...
since a 1 is 0x31 in ASCII and a 0 is 0x30 in ascii.
To communicate to the website that we want the binary data 9b193b.. to be hashed, we encode it as hexadecimal (this is already done) and tell the website to interpret it as hexadecimal data and not as a string of ASCII chars.

If you are truly paranoid, you use the Glacier Protocol

Yes. All keys on your Trezor are derived from the recovery seed. Those keys are all you need to access your BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:33:18
Just HODL, and buy all the coins if it goes to zero. That's what I would do.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:33:32
I also found it a bit coinfusing. In my understanding:
* for non HD wallet it is file encryption of the wallet file
* for HD wallet's it is the passphrase
If you want to have more password, you have to create the wallet multiple times with different passwords.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:27:59
HODL. You can't have my bitcoins for a measly $5000/BTC! Forthermore, I am not smart enough to time the market and buy back lower.

Recent versions of Electrum should be able to restore a Trezor seed.
* create/restore
* standard wallet
* I already have a seed
* in the next screen, click on Options and enable BIP39

If miners cooperate, then there is no disruption to the network. This is not the case with a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:39:41
This is always the question. The answer is: HODL and buy more.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:31:40
I will hold, but I won't do transactions until the outcome is clear. (and I will monitor the progress on my own site [UASF monitor](

No. The pruned state can't be verified without seeing the whole history.

What generators did you use?
I created a binary file on my system (Debian GNU/Linux) with hexer (a binary editor) and then ran sha256.

Side chains? If successful they will make bitcoin the de-facto reserve currency of the internet...
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:04:36
I'd like that. I can credit you at the bottom of the page and I plan to release the sourcecode of it all. If you can live with that, feel free to suggest some CSS.

My Electrum asks for 'a password to encrypt your wallet keys', that's the place to put the Trezor password.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:54:05
Can you provide a link with more information? Google is not that helpful...
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:49:36
To 'move' bitcoins from the main chain to a side chain and back, you need a two-way-peg. Some explanation: 
The idea is: 
- send BTC to some address on the main blockchain, such that the sidechain recognizes this as a transfer to the sidechain and release coins on the sidechain
- and also the other way around
The way this is done currently is a 'federated peg', as in some organisations own a multisig address on the bitcoin blockchain and have the abilitiy to create coins on the sidechain. They watch the main chain and the sidechain and act accordingly.

That's beautiful. I have updated the site and also added some classes and id's.

If I calculate the sha256, I get:

which is correct.

Edit: it is good to do these things manually in order to really understand the process. Just like sending an email by talking to an SMTP server.

It works fine. Arbitrators are honest.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:48:46
Read about it on slashdot a couple of times and finally (too late) decided to learn about it (in the summer of 2012).
@_date: 2015-02-22 08:57:49
It's just novelty value. Without the bitcoin network, it would be infeasible (take a long time/be expensive) to find data that hashes to 00000000000000000XXXX......
log2_work is now 82,  so we expect there to be one block with a hash that starts with 00000000000000000000 (20 hex digits). It requires 2^80 hashes to find, which is a LOT and could not realistically have been done without hte bitcoin network.

Amounts are frozen until:
- the two peers agree (if the arbitrator is not involved)
- a peer agrees with the arbitrator
The [bitsquare FAQ]( has some rationale for the trade limit.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:01:07
Ok. Thats great!  Let me know if you have something, or need some 'class'es in the html.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:19:46
There are two. Manfred Karrer (the creator of BitSquare) and someone else (also involved in the project for a long time).
I only needed arbitration because of technical issues. I haven't had dealings with bad actors.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:33:48
To keep it simple:
- TREZOR generates one key and checks if it is/was used in the blockchain
- TREZOR generates the next key and checks if it is/was used in the blockchain
- etc
It stops if it finds 20 unused keys in a row. 
So, in a sense, the bitcoins are online and TREZOR uses your wordlist to find them.
