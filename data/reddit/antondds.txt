Hello, its still Monday somewhere, I guess... Why is the Hash Rate is jumping so drastically... There is 42 ( I'm guessing THashes) and 6.5 ( the same thing) just few hours apart? And blockchain is for on maintenance or anything.
It really slows down confirmation time for transaction, isn't it ?

Actually, the guy is adding little by little towards the existing order as it is getting filled.

here is simple ( mathematical) way for you to find out ( if you are not a believer):
1. come up with the high price bitcoin can reach
2. think what are the chances reaching that price
3. multiply 1 and 2
4. compare with current price (and make a decision or go to next point)
5. Hallelujah, keep them

It's smart to take riskiest risks while you are younger. 
It's easier to tolerate higher risks earlier.
