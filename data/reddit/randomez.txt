Hi, can I just asked what was the path you took that led you to penetration testing? Its something that I have been interested in and would like to learn more about
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:21:17
You are right! It would be a trust lost in BTC, a black swan event that would cause a ridiculous amount of panic selling

There are three statements there...

Feels like you should add problem and remove old for consistency wrt intersections

As a history student, I'll bite. 
Most of the years refer to recessions: 
2002/08/01 refers to the stock market downturn 
1997 is the year of another downturn (Asian Financial Crisis) 
198004 -&gt; Start of recession in April 
1998/11/01 is the delegation of powers to the ministry of finance 1999 
I'll add to this as time goes on 
Tbh slightly peeved that I can't find a 1971 in the photo. That's the year Nixon announced that the USD would no longer be pegged to gold.

Did you also tell him that he has to remove everything from the paper wallet at once ?

Stock Market Downturn. That's the first one I answered :) 
I think it's genius. This photo encapsulates why people buy Bitcoin.

I've sent a support ticket to Bittrex before. Got automated replies for 3 weeks. I hope you get better service!!

So you're saying that you should let this productive ineffiency exist in the name of morality? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:58:34
I'll address this since I'm on the same side as you. I don't intend to gouge the end users, but I can't help somewhat feel as if you are adopting a very reductionist approach to this.
What do you actually propose people do, in light of this market inefficiency?
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:00:21
Letting productive inefficiency exist is not an idealistic scenario. It's a realistic scenario. Eradicating inefficiencies and information assymetry is an idealistic scenario.  (:

Yeah that was the point I was trying to let him discover. I share some of his values but this choosing of ideals thing seems highly naive. At some point in our lives we realise that our priorities and our values are not shared by the entire world and therein lies the potential for conflict.

You should put your coins in a wallet that allows you to hold your private keys. (From this thread, Breadwallet and Electum seem to be recommended) 
This will allow you to access your BCC to sell them. When you access your BCC using your private key, please remember to move your BTC to a new wallet, as broadcasting your private key to access BCC will compromise your BTC security (unless you use an offline setup- but if you're asking this, I'm sure you don't)  
I use Jaxx for BTC (a very small amount) (but there's a security exploit that they refuse to fix- so don't use that!) Jaxx is a hot wallet for me because I can access it on my phone and I do use BTC to pay for stuff IRL.

Is Exodus supporting both?

For people wondering what the three characters are, it basically means "fake divorce". 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:45:13
Any BTC wallet will work. Just remember to transfer your BTC to another wallet once you've broadcasted your private key to access your BCC
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:30:58
Oh I meant that you have to keep your BTC in a private wallet (to get BCC). No idea about the BCC wallet, sorry! 
Edit: bitcoincash.org seems to list a number of compatible wallets
