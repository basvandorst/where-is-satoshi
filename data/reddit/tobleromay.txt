Lightning network is similar but this is an even more basic concept. LN, as far as I know, is far more decentralized and trustless than transferring money on exchanges. It can't run away with your money like the exchanges theoretically could.

That's wrong. If you and the other person you want to send money to have accounts on the same exchange, you can usually do it for free.

If you use the blockchain there almost always has to be one. But if you're transferring money from one account on an exchange to another, that's purely internal to the exchange and its accounts itself.

What economic fantasy land are you living in where being deflationary is bad for an asset's value?

PoW is by far the worst method of trustless distributed consensus... except for all of the others.

What you're talking about is swapping your private addresses around between different programs on your own computer. That's different than showing somebody else your private key.

LN makes this completely irrelevant. Litecoin is worthless copycat coin and always has been. It has only gotten a temporary advantage due to exploiting the political situation in Bitcoin.

Advocating =/= coercing
I'm not saying leaving a horse's head in your bed or anything. But I do seriously hope you are taking the possibility of exponential growth (and the possibility if Bitcoin's concurrent demise) for Litecoin because of Bitcoin lacking Segwit seriously.

Lightning channels will be closed/open far less often than either 10 or 2.5 minutes.

Not all of us support alt-coin inflation.

If you're talking about atomic cross-chain trading, the very nature of it means that it necessarily involves more than one blockchain, so yes Litecoin could still very well be irrelevant in that case.

It's a reddit glitch. I NSFWed the post to block it.

Oh okay. I'll check on it later.

He lost... *hundreds of thousands*?
If I had that many Bitcoin, the BIP38-encrypted private keys would mostly be buried 100 feet underground in a nuclear bomb-proof safe on my private island. I can't say I feel too bad for him. That's way too many to keep on Coinbase.

Isn't that the whole point of UASF in the first place?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:28:08


I have no idea. The first part is the key though. Don't let people know you have a lot of Bitcoin and you won't have a problem.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:11:48
I have a friend who says he might have some old BTC who would be interested in knowing how to do this.
