Doesn't this only lead them to part of your bitcoin wealth? If your bitcoins aren't all tied together in some way, they can't find the other pieces. And this all assumes you don't use a bitcoin mixing service or take some other precaution.
And then we still have the matter of what the authorities can actually do if they can even prove you have some bitcoins - they can't take the bitcoins out of your bank account like they can dollars. And I think they'd have a hard time jailing you unless there was no doubt that the bitcoins were yours.
Honestly, the IRS wouldn't even have enough spending to warrant investigating you unless you were spending way above your income on actual tangible products that they could audit and ask for receipts for. People misreport their income all the time - this just makes it easier.

A short position can also be bought-in if you're unable to lock up a borrow long-term and it gets harder to locate, forcing you out of the position at an undesirable price before it even gets a chance to go to zero.
Short stock positions also have unlimited downside, so it's possible your bankroll could be depleted before the stock (or bitcoin) goes to zero. For instance, you could short a bubble "correctly" on its way up (but not yet at the peak, and obviously before it bursts), but run out of money for margin calls and be forced out of the position.
There are a ton of reasons not to short something even if you're 100% certain it will be zero within some timeframe (especially if it might take five years).

And Bitcoin would still provide an anonymous way to store value (like if you're hiding it from a government or something - Hi IRS!).

This part is exactly right. You wouldn't snail mail some cash to a business you didn't know well and expect to get a product in return (even assuming the mail itself was safe). Eventually there will be PayPal or CC type intermediaries (or even existing companies that already do that kind of thing with other currencies) who know both sides of the transaction.

This isn't true. It is very possible to short something, have it go to zero dollars and still lose money.
[If you short a stock,]( for instance, the cost of borrowing those shares could be high enough that you lose more money than you make by having the stock fall to zero.

Except the example I gave is way more likely than those other things. Not to mention the fact you need to find a trustworthy exchange to short bitcoins on.

It isn't like I could start up my own sub called A lot of the very plain names were taken a long time ago and there's no way to avoid their mods. Has any sub ever replaced a default with the same basic subject matter?
Maybe if there was an impeachment process on reddit or some election process for new mods once a year or something.

Did you even read the thread? I'm not bitching about anything. I'm explaining to why the whole "default sub" thing isn't a free market process (there are huge barriers to entry for any new sub, such as the fact that "good" names are taken).

Yup. When I worked in trading it was pretty routine to bid out of the market prices for quantities up to (and beyond) everything that was likely to be sold. If there are even just ten players doing this, you'd see an enormous amount of "buyers", but really none of us were interested in the stock or bond at all - we just wanted a chance to buy it cheap and then resell it shortly after at market rates.

I meant it not as a way to anonymously fund terrorism or buy guns and drugs, but as a way to avoid taxation or hide money from a spouse. The government can't freeze your bitcoins or confiscate them even if there's evidence that the bitcoins **may** belong to you (maybe they could threaten to jail you for not handing them over, but how would they definitively prove it? We'll see if it comes up in court).

It was my understanding that this requires waiting for the confirmation, which can take minutes rather than milliseconds. I may be wrong, though.


Even if you're intentionally trying to design your own wallet(s) to do it? I don't see how they prevent that at the wallet level (isn't that part of what the blockchain is for? Which in my understanding would require waiting for the confirmation to be sure it isn't fraud), although, obviously I haven't read every single thing on Bitcoin.


Thanks, I will!

Isn't that true only if you're waiting for confirmations, though? If they're done simultaneously, how do you know someone isn't cheating you? As for the wallet - isn't that just a client-side software thing that can be maliciously mishandled?

If that's the case, what's to prevent me and 100 accomplices from [simultaneously] going to various Starbucks (and other types of stores, so internal checks wouldn't even catch it) and buying $100 worth of stuff and sending the same bitcoins to pay for it? I would think they'd need to wait for the confirmation to avoid fraud.
Edit: added the word "simultaneously" in case my meaning wasn't clear without it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:13:13
For a big slow transaction, it makes sense to me, but I thought the confirmations were too slow for businesses like Starbucks?

And the choices seem intentionally low return / low risk except for Bitcoin. At least one of the options should have been some sort of stock investment.
