That is not what a crash is. When discussing asset prices, a crash is a drop of 50% or more. If you bought on the first of December, the price dropped about 65% (thus crashing) by December 18th. If held until today, you are still down by 25%.

You will not be getting the regular security updates if the laptop is off for extended periods of time. A connection to the Internet when there is an unpatched remote exploit on startup is theoretically all it would take to lose everything.

There is no such thing as "luke warm" storage. The coins are either hot or cold. What you've described is a hot wallet. If you're buying that many bitcoins, you should learn how to use a proper cold paper wallet. Unless that amount is trivial to you.

You have Quark in your name, therefore your argument is invalid. We are done here.
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:28:25

@_date: 2014-03-03 00:21:28

2) Buy their shares.

It is already useful.

It would probably only be a matter of time until someone figured out how to counterfeit it, and drain that country of a large portion of its Bitcoin reserves.

Yes, I had a nice chat with them.
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:03:26
It snot.
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:16:40
This was possible long before Bitcoin. Most people are too dumb to figure it out.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:02:26
I decided to check and make sure. Looks like my key was leaked! 
What do?
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:34:41
Hmmmm, no.
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:49:53
I give nothing.
@_date: 2014-04-27 05:32:51

It would probably be better for Bitcoin in the long term to slow the unsustainable growth of a future runaway bubble.

Thankfully transactions you broadcast can not be modified like that, as they are cryptographically signed. Make sure you are the only one who knows the signing key (so don't send it to Google, or put it in your browser cookies, or transmit it over WIFI.) This level of security is not trivial.

What expert says you should have 15% of your portfolio in crypto? That's insane.

@_date: 2015-07-21 06:39:24
Is it 2011?
@_date: 2015-07-09 06:44:37
It would probably do both at various points.
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:44:24
Digitizing a paper wallet would seem to defeat the purpose.
@_date: 2015-07-11 05:25:22
Thanks, I just spammed some pages.
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:23:19
Nice work. I think I have a new go-to explorer.
My suggestion: it would be nice to geo-detect the user location to set the currency for balances. AUD by default is probably not friendly for most of the world.
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:35:23
If Bitcoin didn't exist, neither would Litecoin. It is just a copy of Bitcoin with a slightly modified mining algorithm.
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:13:53
No; just no.

I think it would be simpler to use Bitcoin for all three.

Bitcoin is the Internet of finance. Both the Napster and Itunes of finance will be built upon it.

And there were on the Internet cryptographers abiding in the mailing-list, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of Satoshi came upon them, and the glory of the blockchain shone round about them: and they were afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of Bernanke a Saviour, which is Bitcoin. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the code wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a sourceforge. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising Satoshi, and saying,
"Glory to Satoshi in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:52:02

Don't keep the bulk of your coins in a third party service. Small amounts can be used for off chain transactions, such as changetip.

Simple. Wait for it to go lower, then sell. Once the price returns, buy back.

You need to create a transaction sending the coins to an address you control, and there are a number of ways to do so. Blockchain.info has a sweep function, which is probably the easiest to use. A Mycellium cold storage transaction could send the coins (this is what I was planning to use). Or you could create a raw transaction yourself with the official bitcoin software or brainwallet.org, (the most dangerous option, you need to be careful creating transactions yourself that you don't end up sending more to transaction fees than you intend.)

Cheapest would have to be exchanging for cash in person. It would take some time to sell that amount though, I would think.

From this laymans point of view, it would appear quite secure. I am not aware if this standard has been reviewed by any cryptographers of note though.

A drop larger than 50% is considered a crash, and Bitcoins just dropped by 65%.

Good idea. I'd say print out a sheet with the Bitcoin logo, maybe with the text "Bitcoin accepted", and a QR code of your address to put next to the hat.

Bummer, sad I missed it too. Just as a warning: you should remove that address from your wallet. If change from a transaction were sent to that address, anyone would be able to spend it.
See "how do I delete an address?" here: 
Be careful to only remove this contest address.

You're welcome to your opinion on what a reasonable fluctuation for Bitcoin is, just don't be surprised if people are confused when you use accepted financial jargon incorrectly. A crash is a 50% drop; be it in stock, currency, or any other asset.

The drop from $1250 to $450 can be seen on that chart. I believe a 65% drop qualifies as a crash.

You've turned a paper loss into a realized loss, and your plan is to wait for it to spike again before buying back in? Good luck to  you.
