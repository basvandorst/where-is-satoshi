Hey there, this is Frank from Masley Gloves.  
Thanks for asking for the warmer gloves. Most of our gloves are for moderate cold wet weather (that's our specialty).  
However, we do have some warmer gloves that [we made for the US Luge Team]( over the years.  We'll put those up on the website and we'll put another run into production to have ready.

Thank you so much for helping with our promotion!  This means a lot to our manufacturing business - to help us sell directly to the end user.

Hey there, this is Frank of Masley Gloves.
Entering the Bitcoin market is a new venture for our business and it is great to read the interest in these posts. I believe in the future of Bitcoin and how it can help us keep manufacturing here in the US and provide a gloves at a good value directly to the end user.

We make the gloves here in the US so the business model is quite different than typical retail.  Our margins are very thin so we only have a little bit of room to work with on promotions (yet allows us to have high quality standards &amp; customization in making the product). 
The 3% comes from the transaction fees &amp; chargeback risks saved that are normally factored into pricing, this is also the rate used by Gyft and some other bitcoin accepting companies. We're simply passing on the savings we receive from customers using cheaper payment methods.
