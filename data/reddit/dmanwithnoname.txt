Is there any chance that you installed your wallet file somewhere other than the default location? If so Multibit may have been set or reset to look in the default location and therefore you don't see your files? I did that with Electrum once and freaked out when I didn't see my file, but realized it was opening up the wrong location.

I don't have any advice on the matter, but I was really hoping Coinbase was going to be "the one". Over the years most of the ways to use USD to purchase bitcoin always appeared (IMHO) shady or cumbersome. 
After finding their site and making purchases, I was still left feeling... paranoid. The customer service lagging behind does not help matters. This is their face of the company, the part we interact with, they really need to have that part buttoned up with faster response time if they want to earn trust. 
I also wanted to say thanks for RES. As soon as I get my bitcoins I know where I'll be sending my first bittip. Just need to use the right bot it appears. It's funny, I've been here 5 years and it's the first time I've seen your username outside of RES related stuff (well, I guess it's still kind of related) so this moment is kind of like bumping into a celebrity on the sidewalk. At least for me.
And this is the part where I walk away giggling, looking for someone that I can message who will understand what just happened.

People would game the system like never before. It wouldn't be worth it for a business to even think of dealing in BTC if that was the case.

Well, I thought for sure it was some scam that Dave was in on, but after a quick search on reddit, it's legit -  
I read most of the IT subs on reddit and somehow I missed this.

The business isn't "hanging onto your money temporarily". They didn't loan you the product. You purchased it. The money is then theirs to do with what they will. 
I feel that consumers lately (not specifically you, I'm just discussing here) have a very high sense of entitlement when it comes to buying from a company. ~~On the other hand,~~ From my perspective, I've always felt that a business has no obligation to offer you their products. In fact, America has had to create laws in order to FORCE some businesses to sell to everyone. 
If I had a business and knew customers that felt they deserve the exact change in BTC if they returned a product, I wouldn't even offer the option. It's not a fair trade.

Looking at the dates it look like gta5 was out and bf4 was about to come out. Priorities.
