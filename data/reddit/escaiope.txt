It's the classical demand theory. I like the stock flow theory more. 
You have to think about this. Frist halving the production rate reduced by 25 btc per Block. Now it will only be reduced by 6.25 Bitcoin per block. So the absolute impact goes down with every halving. That's why we should not expect the same x10 over the next 5 halvings in my opinion. The trend will break for both theories in 2-3 halvings unless the usd goes down in flames

Eth and Bitcoin just have different purposes. Maximalism does not help to have a healthy look on any topic. Maybe they can Co-exist and one can benefit from the other? 
I am with you regarding xrp tho

Well that was what i thought after reading the article. It could just stated in 2 sentences, that this obvious thought is discussed elsewhere. And I would be happily reading that. When you present scientific research you should always discuss the possible (!) flaws and criticism. 
I was just working with what was given to me here. Thanks for the tip, I will listen to the podcast.

It can do anything after all

The USD Price might go x100 but i doubt that the buying Power will go x100

Comparing Bakkt with the Apollo Mission, lol
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:38:54
I read the whole article. Can you point it out to me?
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:34:37
Nice try, EOS Shill

So in 50 years the price is infinte..
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:36:44
So next thing is 2 Years sideways and than reach ath in about 15 years?

That's why i started with Crypto. Hopefully the next stock market crash wont hit this place to hard. This is the most important question, since Bitcoin never had lived trough a stock market crash. 
But there are always investment opportunities. P2P-Loan could be a thing for me until the markets have settled a bit. On the other hand, the stock market could continue like this for another 5 years.
I have my fixed plan for another year and then i will revalue all opportunities. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:06:06
Sooo it will go to infinity?.. The trend can not go on forever 
@_date: 2018-09-10 08:28:53
We will see. I hope Bitcoin by then will be a hedge to the stock market. But ETFs and all this stuff strengthen the relationship between those asset classes. No one knows what will happen to btc if we get a hugh economic crisis.

I for myself have a fixed maximum sum which i want to invest into this space before i switch to less risky/rewarding investments. I started my first job in February. I put in around 1/20 of the max sum every month since February. Price does not matter for my buying, plan is fixed.

Do not compare stocks with Crypto, god damit 
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:09:03
I hope the market makes big moves soon, so we can go back to some nice Memes instead of prediction-articles
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:29:55
Artikel was posted yesterday

It sounded like solid TA until he said "a bounce from this level would bring us the biggest bullrun..". I had to stop the video bc bullshit
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:12:31
Now all the big money from the Zimbabwe Exchanges will pull the trigger for next Bull run

Is there a Android Version in sight?

You could at least accept the fact, that some altcoins bring new, and good ideas to the table. I doubt that bitcoin devs claim to hold the holy grail of new ideas.
I don't claim, that there is a better dlt than btc today, but just be a little bit less absolut please. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:12:21
Yes, right now the only possible ending is for the Crypto to tank to 0. Thats not how it should end if you "Pump it very good".

Of cause there is a huge amount of suppression in most of these countries. And I dont want to hide it. But also some really great things happening there. Shababtalk is a great and controversial show with millions of viewers 
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:21:46
Can you explain this a little bit further? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:51:51
That is the 4% Inflation in Supply i talk about in the post 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:52:42
Well, thats why i opened it. Guess i mixed Value inflation and supply inflation?! 
@_date: 2018-06-04 09:39:20
Bitcoin is also under inflation until all Bitcoins are mined
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:53:14
thx, always wondered who those people are who ask questions, which can easily be answered by google. Well
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:17:18
Circulation is 1,6 Trillion while the US Debt is 21 Trillion, lol
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:48:40
Is there a place where you can check the current overall "Marketcap" of the USD and other Currencies, or is that under closure?
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:13:07
So what comes after Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:59:40
Can anyone give a screenshot?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:49:10
As long as you write it like this and not in Number of Bitcoins, we got nowhere 
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:42:35
I appreciate the discussion more than the upvotes, so im fine. I didn't expect much and am very happy that I got more than "FUD FUD FUD" Boys
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:29:56
That was factored in in this calculation
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:49:02
And that is a possible threat to Bitcoin i guess. That politics will make it illegal before it consumes 50% of earth's energy. Or isn't it?
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:50:09
They defined it at Wh/transaction 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:55:02
Yeah, I meant that they make it soo inconvenient to use, that most wont use it. I know that the network itself will survive. The more important question to me is if it will be used widely 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:22:24
That's what im trying here 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:44:11
I just read an scientific article that stated that centralized systems like Visa or swift are way more efficient that Bitcoin (obviously). But decentralization comes at a price, and i guess we have to pay it. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:42:39
Thanks for the great discussion! 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:21:38
Thanks. So when we raise the efficiency we also raise it for the attackers and that's why the efficiency is irrelevant?! 
@_date: 2018-11-08 15:16:58
Maybe Bitcoin won't be criticized so much if the transactions and more important the transactionvolume will reach significant numbers
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:29:51
Im from europe and here the Washington Post is broadly seen as an outstanding newspaper with a great history of good (investigative) journalism (watergate etc). Since the US is ultra devided into two opposite worldviews (represented by dems and reps) I have the feeling that the rating of journalism is highly effected by their overall political standpoints.
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:22:33
What newspaper/page do you personally prefer and is writing the truth in your opinion? And please draw ny times into this picture
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:06:49
On the other hand. Good journalism like this needs to be paid and by 'stealing' the content from their page, they don't get a single Satoshi for your read. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:02:13
I guess it only gets confirmed if it breaks out in the right direction. So wait another 1-2 Weeks. Might get confirmed 
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:34:04
