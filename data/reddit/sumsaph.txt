it seems someone is balls deep in bcash, lol. stop posting same shit to every topic on this sub please and go back to bcash subs where you can find "quality" posts about how bcash isnt a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:35:31
also there is 5 bscam trash to take out too. 5 of them makes another 1 btc nowadays so be fast to get rid of it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:08:44

@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:00
probably they got sick because you are using conbase.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:25:27
he said 6+, so dont forget sock puppet team no.7
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:49:56
he is probably laughing at jihan&amp;calvin who are tricked by him into holding the million bcash bags in the pursuit of flippening. and plans to procceding into his next scam.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:03:45
he should bring those classy boat hookers to taiwan too.
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:47:37

@_date: 2017-11-23 05:41:42
sad fact, that guy killed himself after a while.
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:23:40
those people would deserve what is coming for them 100%. no one will shed a tear.

i just dig  a hole and hide 2 ounce of gold someplace.
take your shovel and start to dig around earth. you have chance to find it as much as guessing a private key. good luck.
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:14:53


better advice, dont download any app unless u really really need it at all.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:54:33
same things apply if u dig a hole and hide your gold in it.

im sure that 10 years later, people will realise&amp;accept that roger&amp;craig were heroes.
they literally scammed jihan by making him believe in bcash by somehow and bankrupted&amp;rekted mullti-billion dollar unsinkable chinese company "**in a year**", which was the biggest threat for decentralization.
thank you for your services, roger.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:54:23
oh, just fck off roger and go count your own sub's active shills for whom to pay at the end of the month.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:33:18
your right.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:06:40
they sold silkroad's bitcoins by auctions. it will be the same.
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:17:38
thats retarded. change the PoW already.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:24:09
bcash is already obsolete, it's daily average block size is like 70 kb. yes, kilobytes. and their main sales pitch is "we need bigger block size". what a joke. 
it seems you dont need bigger block sizes if no one uses your scamcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:11:11
roger is flipping off to the screen probably.
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:47:14
all memes are up and ready to fire, untill 19k. lets go!
@_date: 2018-12-05 07:23:37
finally, some good news to cheer up!
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:40:54
no one gives a crap about roger. do your sockpuppetry somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:47:05
because space travel is impossible because of Van Allen radiation belt.. 
its almost like an intelligent design that shackles and bounds us to earth.
