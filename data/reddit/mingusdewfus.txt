I sent one the other day, didn’t make the fee high enough, bounced in about 48 hours or so. Maybe 72 hours. I just resynced my wallets and everything went back to the original wallet. I set the fee a bit higher and it went through confirmed in 30 minutes on second try. 
During that time I read it can take up to two weeks for a low fee transfer that doesn’t get picked up and confirmed to be dropped from the blockchain. That was an older post/article I read that in, so maybe faster now. 
Did you check the transfer on the blockchain or just in the wallet? Check it on the blockchain if you haven’t.

What if I told you, it’s always smart to remain skeptical of a source’s motives, with all things in life. 
*You and I* want to invest in things we believe in, and that is good! However, you see an article in The Financial Times espousing the likelihood stock XXXX is going to the moon, or so-and-so on The Financial News Network says to put your $ into gold because it’s really taking off, feel free to do some digging on those sources and see their involvement with the projects or industries. Are *they* saying to invest in this because it’s what they believe or are they simply acting as a propaganda arm for that industry/company/etc.? That’s what you should be asking always. 
With Woz and BTC he is probably just excited about the tech and more stuff that connects his personal ideology and technology together. I don’t think he has any angle on this other than being genuinely excited about cryptocurrency, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if he’s holding a few million in BTC and other alt-coins ;)

It’s kind of my point that the slow rollout of solutions like LN has stalled the growth of BTC and let something like ETH grow. The fact that BTC developers have been slow to fix this known problem is exactly my issue.

Eh, there is a lot of cult worship in this sub, and also FUD spread by people for their own purposes, so sometimes difficult to have a real discussion here. If you look at it objectively the issues with BTC, e.g. transfer speed, could really limit it as other coins that look to address those issues, like ETH, surge to fill that need. Intrinsically BTC looks to fill a niche as a decentralized currency. Philosophically it certainly meets the decentralized part, but with slow transfer speeds it will never be adopted to the point that it supplants actual dollars in transactions. That’s a real problem when the value currently is tied to speculation and not the intrinsic usability as a currency, which is the actual purpose of BTC. If BTC can’t be used as a currency, which is again limited by slow transfer speeds, then as speculative interest wanes so will the speculative value. That’s an actual threat that as an investor has to be recognized.

The current price is the standard price because it’s what you can get it at.

Supply and demand also is a real thing.

For fucks sake he could be in his underwear for all we know. Just throw this shit coat on over the pit stained under shirt and keep the camera framed above waist. Good. To. Go.

I’m glad LN is happening, but the slow implementation has allowed ETH and others to find footing in the market. That’s the kind of threat I talk about.

Makes me wonder how many million he invested during the bubble. 
Is like watching Hannity or Limbaugh tell their listeners to invest in gold. You know those motherfuckers have millions in gold and are doing everything they can to drive it up. 
Or hell, anytime you read a blog or investment article saying “buy this stock” .. what is their interest in the stock?
Always motivation there.

Didn't Kim Kardashian have like $10-12 million in jewelry robbed from her at gun point when she and Kanye were in Paris? Jewelry is comparable to BTC stored on a local drive/Trezor/etc. the robber can just walk off with that shit.

I haven't looked into it, but it kind of had one of those feelings where they wrote a character out of the show because the actor couldn't/wouldn't work on the show any longer.

This is me, I sold $6000 worth to cover taxes. At the time it seemed smart, BTC had been volatile and I was making a little profit on it. I effectively have lost out on $6000 in profit since then though. Fml.

For $500 to turn into $200,000, a 400x increase in value, given that btc is trading around $2500, you would need to purchase it around $6.25... so maybe at some point in 2011 if you bought $500 worth it would be $200k today.

What if he never gets rid of the one you give him? Maybe he's a hodler

If he had of gained position, yes there is a penalty, but since it cost him positions it's not a problem :)
