I know, was simply trying out new ways and recently found VirWox. Was hoping that works but it didn't and now the $3.92 is stuck in PayPal; until it gets withdrawn to my bank account once again which would not help as i would be loosing on transactional fees :(

True! I understand that. And i also know that asking someone to work on the basis of trust and faith would not make much sense. But there should be some way, shouldn't it.
For example, in a forum i read that people do this on Freelancing sites (buy their work in exchange of desired currency). I did not want to opt-in for that as it was not ethically right - but that was a way though.
Similarly, is there any place i could request someone (anyone) to TRY it out as an experience? Sadly, the PayPal system in India is not much evolved for me not to seek assistance with someone else.

To me, it just serves a purpose to dig something new up. Apart from mining / working for a fee, bitcoins can now be earned via tips, faucets (referrals) and what not! Most importantly, for free (in technicality).
What inspired me was a response made on a particular (different) portal which stated as a response to "But bitcoin is outlawed and unavailable in so many countries" and i quote - "oh yeah! well if Bitcoin is unaccessible in 5 countries, PayPal is in 21". THAT most certainly got my attention.

I beg to differ. Couldn't find even a single task to complete as a noob there. Not sure what or why that was as there are tons of other faucets that paid out a lot more than the aforementioned bitcoin count. Or its probably just me.

True; but honestly, the much more aspect, to me. just circles back to to it being worth something (by which i mean money *wink*).
And to add perspective to it, i had stumbled upon how the "Winklevoss twins plan space trip, funded by Bitcoin"  and the  which clearly shows / states that 1 BTC was also once worth about $1000+
First glimpse was simply unbelievable.
