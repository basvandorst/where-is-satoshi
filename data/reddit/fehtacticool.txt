After the ATH of $19.8k, we saw a dead cat bounce at $17k. Since then, it’s been making lower highs and lower lows (hitting below $10k this morning).  This is not a dip but a crash indeed. I bought around $8k last November and rode the wave up all the way, then hesitated to sell at $19k. Finally saw the bear pattern and unloaded everything at $15.8k and the last bit at $14.2k. I had to protect profits. I held too long listening to all the HODL people here. Your first job as an investor is protect profits.

When the price of a stock or equity goes down massively, then followed by a sudden uptrend on price gives you a false sense of a price recovery, everyone starts buying back, only for it to go down again.

I transferred from cold storage to my wallet, 1000sats/byte ($34) at the time. This is ridiculous. I will keep my ledgers until something better comes out. Not even wire transfers have this much overhead. Love the technology, but dislike the high fees for now.

A solid 5 figures in USD into it, cold storage and some through Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).

If you didn’t want to “become rich” yourself, you should just sell all of your BTC and give it away to the “poor”. Don’t be a hypocrite.

Then why do people in this subform refute the importance of running a full Bitcoin core node, it’s because they don’t want to contribute to the technology, they just want to get rich. This is what has truly disappointed me about this forum.

2 to the power of 256, is the basis of Bitcoin. Read about SHA-256. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:30:27
Of course those limits depend on your country (I was speaking of the US which I know first hand).
You definitely can liquidate all your bitcoins into your local currency and store it in the exchange. The problem occurs when transferring USD from the exchange into the bank (these are the limits I was referring to).
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:06:28
I got out too (I bought at 8k, sold at 14k and some at 15k). It dipped real fast, real hard. I will rebuy below 10k. 
This was a good test of GDAX, and getting stuff out of cold storage. Worked real well I have to say. 6+ confirmations in under an hour, but the fees are too high for me for now. (1000sat/b is ridiculous).

Trading institutions are looking to make money of course, and they can do it both when prices go up and shorting, or buying a security at the highest possible price and immediately selling it, leaving whomever broker is buying for you gets to pay the higher initial price and you pocket the difference of the price drop. It will be interesting to see how the market moves on Dec 18th, this is a first.

Transferred some BTC out of my cold storage, miner fees were $33 at normal confirmation rate. Took about an hour to get 6 confirmations, not too bad. But this system is pretty much useless for transactions below $1,000.

It’s people that have put in $100 and get scared when it goes down to $50 because it’s all they have (About 20-30% of holders have around this amount or less).

That’s how the system works. Someone is placing a sell order on your BTC and then working to get it fulfilled. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:08
Bitcoin core, as for a replacement for wire transfer technology it's very solid and I'm a supporter. But as for day to day transactions, and real usability, there's potential (with Lightning), but still long ways to go. If fees didn't escalate like this during high traffic periods, I would have kept everything, but I'm out for now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:58:15
Yep ACH. Haven't tried bank wires since I'm transacting below $10K.
Go your fidelity account and on the left bar, you can see the option to add an external account, you can select Conbase from there (just to view balances I think). You'll need an API key from coinbase to have the Fidelity backend pull the information from them and display it there.
A recommendation (from my experience thus far), is to pull funds up to your limit or whatever you're looking into investing into a coinbase USD wallet (don't buy BTC directly from the Coinbase as they have high fees), and once the ACH clears, pull the funds into GDAX. You'll be able to buy BTC there instantly and no issues (fees are around $20-$40 per buy operation through GDAX, compared to around $100 through Coinbase's storefront).
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:47:27
For liquidity purposes, if there is an emergency and you need to liquidate to fiat.
Personally, just storing the ledger securely is more than enough. But if you're extremely paranoid, that would work.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:45:55
If you buy on Coinbase with an approved debit card, the funds will show up immediately. The bank transfer via ACH is the one that takes the longest.

You’re still a US citizen abroad, so under IRS guidelines you still must file taxes. Especially now that offshore accounts are under scrutiny (after the UBS scandal).

Yes, here’s the pros and cons of Coinbase:
Pros: easy to use interface for new people, easy to buy BTC, ETH and LTC. Use it on your phone and desktop. 
Cons: high fees transferring BTC out, Service is degraded all the time due to high volume of users lately, security is so-so. 
With GDAX it’s a little like trading stocks in an exchange (placing buy or sell orders). Could be intimidating for newer people. Transfers of BTC out of GDAX are way cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:01:09
That stop loss is too high. If should be around $7.5k at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:20:06
Yep for Insurance payout. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:25:30
Certainly! The only way (from my experience) to be able to convert from BTC into cash such a huge amount in a cold wallet would only be to use  a BTC -&gt; USD exchange like Coinbase and it would have to be done in multiple steps (for example, I think the Coinbase limits might be $10,000 USD/week).
You would transfer, say $10K from your wallet into your Coinbase BTC wallet address, then withdraw the funds to your bank (via an ACH transaction). Then you would have your funds within a few business days in USD.
Also you gotta understand your tax implications, and your potential 15% in capital gains taxes, since now you have tens of millions in unrealized gains. As any gains, these will count as income, and your taxes will certainly be massively impacted. For that amount of capital, I'd recommend a CPA or wealth management firm to assist you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:36:25
I think on par with them. I use Fidelity and they integrate with Conbase directly (so at least I can transact without getting flagged).

Being able to acquire goods and services with BTC would be crucial. It’s possible at this point (see Newegg, Expedia, Overstock.com), it just needs more mass adoption.

Perhaps the best way is to store it in your Nano, store the wallet seed securely and back it up encrypted, encrypt it at rest, and secure it with two factor auth besides your hard copy. Then wipe the Nano and HODL. If you ever need to extract the fund just restore the wallet using the seed. 
I think the Nano S is just secure as it is due to its auto wiping mechanism and the self checks performed. I’m happy with them.

In July 2017, I bought 1.25 coins at $2,900, saw it go up to $3,600, said fuck this shit, and sold at at $2,100 ($800 loss).

When I explain what it is to people, I tell them it’s similar to mining for gold but in a digital world. The gold is akin to a solution to a puzzle. And to solve this puzzle, you require massive amounts of compute power, effort and time to solve. This compute power is made up by machines in a datacenter, in peoples homes, etc. 
Just like mining for gold, which is hard to find, and is a finite resource, so are these digital pieces of data. Gold also requires millions of dollars in mining equipment, prospecting, engineering effort, so does mining for Bitcoin.

As a counterpoint you could say that Bitcoin supporters state “Fiat currency will disappear in the future”. No one can predict the future accurately.
