I'd still like to figure out the websocket api sooner or later, which should be more reliable and less messy, plus it will give me a lot more transaction data to play with. I also want to try the same thing using bitcoind.
If you mean a better way to control my Christmas tree lights, sure :). I'm just playing around and experimenting and learning.

Awesome. I just turned on my Christmas tree lights remotely using a 0.0001 BTC transaction! Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:23:46
That's great to know. Thanks a lot!

That's essentially what I'm trying to do. I'm just not sure how, :). I'm not running a local node, and I'm having trouble using 3rd party APIs...
Actually, I just realized what you're saying. I can have a python script check this URL every few seconds and watch for changes:
Will blockchain.info let me check that page that often?

I think I will setup my own node and bitcoind. Thanks.

Thanks Andreas. If there is to be an audio book, I'd hope you'd do the readings yourself. I would listen to it...

I just referred 2 people earlier today, about 3 hours before this was posted, and only got $5 for each of them... Perfect timing. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:21:37
I just sent you a PM. Thanks.

I just received the full $25 bonus for each of my referrals from yesterday. Thanks a ton!

Same here. Surprise! Your coinbase account has just sent $10 worth of BTC to shift! 
@_date: 2015-11-21 02:51:17
I think its one time. $10 to issue the card. If it get lost / stolen, it will cost another $10 to have it re-issued.

Very nice infographic. I'd like to see more like this.

Just listen to your favorite news station / blog and fill in the squares as you hear the arguments. Winner gets a warm fuzzy feeling.
Credit for the idea goes to from a comment he made in [this]( post

Awesome. Does your boss plan to convert the BTC into USD immediately, or will he save / spend them?

Here's the entire hearing:

But do it in bitcoins, just hand them a paper wallet and let them figure it out...

Here's a board we can use:

I have only bought through MtGox. In the past it has taken a while for my funds to reach them (I transfer from my bank to Dwolla, and then from Dwolla to MtGox, all in USD). I tried using coinbase.com just an hour ago, but after I got everything setup, they said they had reached their daily buying limit, and couldn't do it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:44:36
If you setup a Dwolla account, and link it to your bank, here are some time frames you can expect:
1. Add you bank to Dwolla and get it verified: 3-5 business days
2. Transfer money from your bank to Dwolla: 3-5 business days
3. Transfer money to/from Dwolla to/from MtGox: Less than 5 minutes.
Dwolla is a good way to go if you plan ahead and have the time to wait.

Came here to post the same thing... Age and everything, :)

As far as a business venture, I think it would be cool if one could buy land instantly using bitcoin, and in sectoins as small as 1 sq ft. Maybe buy a few hundred acres of cheap land and hire an attorney to put it in a secure and creative land trust such that thousands of people could buy/sell an interest in it, using BTC.

Bitcoins failed? At this point the only thing that could stop bitcoins would be another virtual currency.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:00:53
A major advantage for early adopters is that customers (who otherwise wouldn't use their services or products) will seek them out, and buy from them. If there were a physical business in my town that accepted bitcoins, I would support them.

Thanks guys, I'm working on it right now.
