And/or changing the economics of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:24:37
Ideally that is true.  In practice the bitcoin devs get to decide a lot of the policy that the default core client implements.  Granted, if their decisions become radical or threaten the majority of bitcoin users, we can always all fork the client and run the "unofficial" bitcoin.  
But in practice as of right now the bitcoin devs have a lot of sway about what happens to bitcoin.  Since they are the ones getting their hands dirty writing the software we all rely upon.
@_date: 2015-12-21 09:04:56
I agree completely.  It's a pretty good level-headed read.  All of us that are into bitcoin should be aware of what's contained in this report.
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:46:28
Whereas "its" is the possessive form of "it" (akin to his/hers, yours), and lacks an apostrophe.
This is confusing in English because proper nouns such as "Bob" use an apostrophe-s to denote posession.
"That is the **cat's** lunch. **Its** lunch must not be eaten by anything else other than the cat. **It's** imperative we only let it eat **its** lunch."

Your criticisms and suggestions are very good and accurate.  I'm an open source programmer.  I know Qt and C++ inside and out.  I could very well come up with some code that does at least some of what you suggest.  I'm soooo lazy though.  It's a lot of work.  But I'll save your post and maybe some day if I am bored I can try and hook up with the bitcoin devs and see if they'll accepts a few glitzy UI patches to the core client.

Generally speaking sovereignty has no meaning without an ability to call upon violence to defend said sovereignty. Whether it be through alliances with other actors capable of doing violence (treaties like NATO, or organizations like the UN, or just having neighbors interested in maintaining the balance of power preventing you from being invaded by more powerful neighbors, etc) and/or having an effective military.
Otherwise sovereignty is just an idea with no teeth. It's like saying you own Jupiter or real estate on the Moon. No nation or anyone else with any power on Earth will recognize your claim.  Have a nice time pretending you own it. Unless you have an army or police force capable of coercing others to recognize your claim, it's pretty useless.  You can't enforce ownership, so your claim is useless.  Same thing goes for sovereignty -- this micronation can pretend all it likes that it is a real nation, but when push comes to shove, I bet you it actually is just part of Portugal.
I am sure Portugal considers the territory "Portugal", and pretty much any real contention of that fact will quickly end with the world agreeing "Yep, it's Portugal alright".

On a practical level it would be fairly impossible to implement this in the real world, because the thieves would learn about it before it's done and move all the coins around to basically "launder" the funds.  
Most of what goes on in the bitcoin software development world is publicly discussed and the bitcoin software itself is open source so actually doing this quickly, before the thieves find out about it, is challenging and probably impossible.

Good point about the slippery slope argument. It's an argument technique that often is abused, indeed, and creates FUD
However, the slippery slope argument itself does not in all cases prove to be untrue.
In the case of Bitcoin, one of its advantages over the banking system is complete freedom to spend money in any direction you please. It's one of the promises of bitcoin. Installing blacklists simply weakens one of bitcoin's strengths.
 In my opinion blacklist should be used as an absolute last resort to prevent the network from collapsing or slowing to a crawl until the protocol/architecture can be fixed in a more elegant way.
As it stands the bitcoin network operates just fine even when most nodes allow the "blacklisted" transactions. This is proof that there isn't really a problem, and that minimally a "default-on" blacklist is an incorrect solution.
In any case, node operators and miners themselves should be allowed to make educated decisions about what they want blacklisted or not. Sneaking a blacklist into a larger patch, not documenting it, turning it on by default, and refusing to change it when challenged on it are all signs of shenanigans and abuse of power on the part of luke-jr.
I'm glad he came around to eventually reverse his position and apologize.

Then, after you finish your coffee, the rest of your day can be spend any fucking way you want.

Actually taxation is pretty obviously just a means to shrink the money supply to prevent rampant price inflation.
Like you said, the government buys whatever it wants whenever it wants. But, it still has to figure out a way to shrink the money supply, and it also needs a way to make the system as obfuscated as possible to keep people from openly rebelling against it.
EDIT: on the local level taxation DOES pay for police.  Just not federally.

I don't think he sounds like a "balanced" person emotionally at this point perhaps due to his life situation, his fathers death, etc. Even his post sounded like a guy who clearly is a little too passionate about his trading. And now it's eating him up.
I wrote him a message to just walk away from trading for a while. Whether it means holding and getting on with his life or selling and coming clean to his family. It's gotten to the point where it's eating him up.

Assuming it were possible to salvage gox (that is, if the hackers didn't take like *all* the bitcoins!), then yeah, gox could be smart and buy up coins cheap in order to make up the difference and meet their BTC obligations to their customers.
They would certainly take a hit on their profits, but it may be required to save the business, and may be the only thing they can do at this point.  It was their mistake in implementing bitcoin poorly, they are going to be forced to eat up the loss.
And, if they wanted to buy BTC cheap today -- It would certainly explain the motivation behind their ridiculously damaging (to bitcoin and BTC price) press release.  Price dipped like 40% at one point today (discounting the 102$ BTC outlier).

Yes and no.
It's nice they are honest about their aims and aren't pussyfooting around, I'll give you that.
But assuming that the name "Free Market" somehow is "better" for more widespread adoption than "Dark Market" -- if that is true.. then their aims are even better served.  
And it's an IF -- we don't really know how just the names "Dark Market" versus "Free Market" would be received -- but we can assume that perhaps "Free Market", if spun right -- would attract a wider audience as a concept.  Anarchists are just one (arguably important!) group.  But a lot of their goals overlap with less radical groups such as Libertarians, Conservatives, free market Capitalists, etc.  Spinning it as "Free Market" stands a greater chance of attracting those kinds of people.  And the bigger the snowball, the better for everybody (including the market itself).  Sort of assuming that this is *only* for contraband (which is basically what the name "Dark Market" half-implies, arguably), while it's bold and brave and commendable, sort of artificially limits it to just that.  I see it more than just that -- I see it as a tool for maximal liberty in commerce.  Screw the government, screw taxes, screw stupid contraband laws, screw embargos and other bullshit.  We are talking 100% Free (as in Liberty).  
And.. of course.. a 100% Free Market also encompasses contraband, after all.  
I'm basically saying Free Market as a marketing concept and name would do more to further their aims.  It's a more powerful, more attractive concept.
And, as someone pointed out -- imagine the news headline "Senator McFuckFace speaks to Congress about banning Free Market".  Etc.  :)
That's my belief anyway.  Reality may disagree.

It's certainly possible.  It's almost impossible to believe that after so many years in the business they didn't know about transaction malleability and didn't do anything to program around it, and that only now they realized what was happening.  It would mean their technical team is incredibly stupid.  It's entirely possible though.  
I'm a programmer and I have seen this happen before.  You have 1 guy who is the lead architect and he's a hotshot and doesn't really allow much creative freedom in his programmers.  He tends to impose how things should be done, and every programmer blindly codes according to his directives.  It's entirely possible 1 lead guy at gox is to blame for not seeing this.
However, it's also very possible gox did this deliberately to manipulate the market.
It seems crazy to do that though.  They have forever tainted themselves in this growing space, and it may cost them any future credibility and any future success they may have had.
So I am leaning on the side of stupidity (that is, they actually made an error in their systems that went unnoticed this long).  I've seen it before, so it's definitely possible... as unbelievably hard as it is to accept and believe.

Hey I think we're both right.  I don't see a conflict at all in our analysis of this bug!  How do you mean?
You managed to explain it with fewer words to your credit.
The only part I may have gotten wrong is exactly what happens on exchange's end when transaction fails.  I assumed the software would auto-credit the user account for the "failed" transactions due to changed transaction ID.  It may be the case that a customer support ticket would be required.. but in either case, the customer gets 2x BTC every time they exploit in this way, and the exchange is short those BTC every time.

bitcoin and dollars? Dollars inflate, so interest rates are higher. A bitcoin loan will have low interest rates, because they will have more purchasing power relative to the dollar when the loan is due.
I think he's assuming that if a lender loaned you 10 BTC, you have to later pay him back exactly 10 BTC (plus interest).  If 10 BTC at start is worth $5,000, and 2 years later it is worth $10,000, you basically just lost $5,000 on top of the principal for that loan, plus interest.  (Alternatively if you don't want to think about it in terms of dollars -- think that 10 BTC = 1 shitty car, and 2 years later 10 BTC = 2 shitty cars).  So deflationary currencies discourage borrowing in the author's mind... because the debtor has to pay back money at a later date that can buy more than it could when he borrowed it.
However assuming deflation isn't 100% (as in the above example), you can price this into the interest rate.  I mean, this happens already with inflation anyway.  Lenders set interest rates above inflation so that their lending investment beats inflation... for obvious reasons.

You could, for the sake of blockchain transparency, do away with the "internal accounting" where you have to decide what funds are frozen and what aren't ... By just using the blockchain itself to hold "frozen" funds in a separate multi-sig address... That way it looks sexier on the blockchain.

Yeah what luke-jr doesn't understand is he's basically acting like he gets to make policy decisions about a CONSENSUS BASED NETWORK.  The protocol is specifically designed to allow certain transactions that are valid, and reject others.
He decided to fundamentally break the bitcoin protocol by introducing a patch that arrives at a different conclusion about what is or is not a VALID TRANSACTION.
Thus now, the network arrives at consensus differently.
So, on a consensus network, this patch is a very bad thing.  It means he gets to control bitcoin!

@_date: 2014-04-03 07:45:04
I think it's wrong too. I agree with you.
But the thinking goes that "savings" ... Or you sitting on a pile of cash for 40 years is in a sense a bit of economic dead weight. Let's say you worked 40 years ago as a tire repairman at a garage.  You replaced tens of thousands tires during the course of your career. Great. You did society and the economy a service. Thanks to you trucks got to their destinations ok, kids got their milk deliveries, the government  got its missile parts on time, etc.  Your life savings represents the debt the economy owes you for your participation and contribution.  You can cash out any time and benefit from the goods and services of our economy as payback. Or your children can too.
The question is: at what point (or if ever) do we give up on paying you back?  You've been sitting around for 40 years not spending ur savings.  At some point -- do we still owe you as much as we did bak then, for work that was done so long ago, the consequences of which become increasingly less relevant with each passing year?
It's an interesting question.
I personally think that the answer is obvious. With increasing productivity due to technology and growth -- today's economy is standing on the shoulders of giants of yesterday, as it were, and we should never debase the currency and rob people of their savings.  Because those people helped build today's economy, yesterday.
In reality all inflation does is rob the masses of their fair share in favor of concentrating more and more wealth in the hands of the few...
Pro-inflation economists argue that inflationary economies encourage growth and investment by discouraging savings. But even deflationary economies experience strong growth and investment. And perhaps this growth is more "natural". 
After all, an inflationary economy puts artificial forces into play whereby everyone is desperate to invest and everyone demands growth to avoid inflation and currency debasement. This artificially forces the market into perhaps risky investments that may actually be a drain on the overall economy... An inefficiency.
EDIT: relevant discussion of the real consequences of inflationary monetary policy

I hope you're right.  
It's possible though that they got a lot of bitcoins before the exchange noticed.  Recall last week that increasing numbers of people were unable to withdraw BTC because of "double spend" errors.
This may indicate that a significant portion of the BTC gox had (at least the BTC in gox's hot wallet.. hopefully not in its cold wallet!!) were "stolen" and no longer valid.
Hopefully you're right and the shitball isn't as big as it can potentially be.

Experienced programmers usually can read their own (or others' code) reasonably quickly and reasonably well.
That being said, I'm an "experienced programmer" and I don't read 99.99% of the open source code I run and just assume it's "ok".  
There are a few people I know that read EVERYTHING they run.  They are linux purists that compile from source and run very minimal systems.

Good point about sticking to the business you know!  In general, I try not to mix my business with my investments.  It's sound advice to keep things simple and not over-complicate a business's scope and books (esp. a small mom &amp; pop type shop like this site). +1 for sound business thinking!
However, since you can potentially be "swimming" in BTC, you can, however, pay yourself a partial salary in BTC, and then use THAT money however you like (such as.. *gasp* hanging on to it as an investment!).
Or, like you say, if vendors up the food chain also start taking BTC.. that's when it starts to really snowball.
And that could very well be the case.. especially internationally.  BTC simplifies a lot of international trade (at least potentially)... And *that*'s exciting as fuck..

Very good point.  It's likely the system works as you described.  But conceptually, it's equivalent to what I was saying.  I was trying to illustrate the concept in simpler terms.  But yes, it's likely you are right that is the way exchanges likely implement user balances.  But conceptually that's equivalent to what I was describing (since, at the end of the day, bitcoins that the exchange thinks exist within its control..  do not anymore, as far as the blockchain is concerned).
I definitely agree they should have caught this much sooner.  It's entirely possible people have been using this exploit for months or years without gox noticing.  I'm astonished they never balanced their books (compared their own wallets to their database totals, for crying out loud!).  But they may very well have not had the inhouse tools developed to do that type of analysis (it isn't just as easy as summing up all your bitcoins in your cold storage wallets and comparing it to customer BTC from database.. it's a little more complicated than that).
And yes, as you point out, hopefully it isn't as bad as we think it may be.  But, given how stupid gox may have been thus far to allow this bug to go unnoticed so long -- I wouldn't be TOO shocked if the damage is on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Or, as you say, maybe it isn't, and they can eat it up with some loss of profit and move on.
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:24:25
Ha ha, I believe you that Gox CS sucks.  But regardless their custom wallet software *thought* they had the BTC, when in reality the BTC was gone.
Either way be sure it caused them massive problems and/or loss of BTC and fiat.
(You can always sell the fake BTC on gox to someone for fiat and cash out that way, or perhaps gox uses hot and cold storage for BTC and so even your 'fake' BTC goes back into a pool of BTC, and if you try and withdraw again,  you may get real BTC again, etc).

@_date: 2014-03-09 21:17:39
Do you hold fiat though? Or must we settle outside the system?  I was under the impression your exchange didn't hold the fiat which makes it a bit slower to transact...
EDIT: Your exchange implements 100% peer-to-peer, meaning parties need to settle with fiat themselves.  This is nice, but it also requires trust on the part of the 2 parties involved (I can receive fiat and never sign the transaction, claming I never got the fiat!).  How do you overcome this?
Also, think about implementing a less "peer-to-peer" option for some users alongside your 100% peer-to-peer option, where you guys hold some fiat for the users that deposit it, to ensure 100% "safe" transactions.
I like what you've done though!

There probably aren't particularly many Bitcoiners here... There is only 1 restaurant in Bucharest that takes Bitcoin. But it's better than a lot of places that have 0 places to spend bitcoin.
Romania is one of the best connected  in terms of cost and access to internet. It's one of the better countries as far as Internet connectivity goes. It beats the USA and ranks just behind South Korea -- and is the  highest in Europe for Internet connectivity! So it has potential.

If (not if, when) some of their suppliers accept bitcoin, we should throw a party.  That means the real bitcoin economy is starting to grow. Also price.  Price may shoot up.
If that happens while a few large companies (like overstock) are holding bitcoin reserves, and they show that on their balance sheets, can you imagine the effect on Wall Street?  "Overstock.com record profits this quarter because Bitcoin!"

Ah yes, I see your point.  It could be a false belief he ends up having about himself -- that he did great because he's smart.  When in reality the hard work is a large component of his success.  It's helpful if he believes that he is smart (so that he doesn't get easily discouraged and has inner strength) and that *also* he realizes hard work is really important.  Like Benjamin Franklin said, genius is 99% perspirtion, 1% inspiration.
I agree about the mothers and fathers.  While a bit controversial in this day and age, I also am of the opinion that the mother and father play different roles here (at least traditionally).

They can enact laws to make exchanges outright illegal.
Influential governments like the US and China can use anti-terror doublespeak to get smaller countries to also ban the exchanges.
They can interfere to such an extent that bitcoin moves 100% into the underground and is relegated to sites like Silk Road.
This is a real possibility. Admittedly unlikely as some wall street people and silicon valley people have already invested in bitcoin and may not let that happen.
But it's still possible and a huge risk for bitcoin.
They can even go further if they wished to and "declare war" on bitcoin, using NSA resources to render the blockchain very forked or very inoperable.
They certainly can severely hamper bitcoin if they wanted to.

Not sure I can wrap my brain 100% around the "lock time" thing -- care to explain this in more detail?
Still, this system, while pretty secure, lacks speed.  Daytraders and others want instant-gratification so they may buy/sell all day.  This for you guys means profit.
You should consider offering another class of accounts that hold fiat (but not bitcoins!) to speed up the trading.  This means more trades, more money for you guys, and more users.  It's a compromise, sure, but you guys are still very differentiated in the market with your multi-sig wallets already so in my mind you still are on the forefront for your 100% on-the-blockchain system, and offering faster trades (by holding fiat) ensures you capture more users.
Have you considered this?

Due to the nature of how people mine, it would make a lot of sense if the base price was $0 when you mined it and then you only had to actually file/pay taxes when you sold it.  That would seem "fairer" to me.  I get your point, I just am worried this will hurt bitcoin (and definitely will if you have to declare each and every purchase and pay tax on it!).

@_date: 2014-02-10 15:26:03
You hit the nail on the head very precisely.  And in less words!  That's exactly the case!  
(In my defense for using so many words, I was trying to be as detailed as possible and the knowledge of this "feature" of bitcoin was fresh in my mind at the time)..
Your second point: Yes, it very likely means that whomever was doing this was exploiting this a lot, and managed to walk away with LOTS of bitcoins...!
However, computing exactly how much gox is short on bitcoins (ie how much the thieves walked away with), is not exactly the sum of all the failed transactions.  
The scenario is more like malicious gox user X sends himself BTC to his external wallet.  He quickly injects changed transaction id to blockchain.. it has a CHANCE of being accepted if he's lucky and his hardware is fast.  If it is, he keeps the BTC but gox thinks he never got them so credits him the BTC again.  The exact BTC in gox's coffers is imaginary at this point.  
Malicious user X sells BTC on gox to some sucker.  Sucker buys BTC and attempts to withdraw all or part of it.  Sucker gets failed TX due to double-spend attempt on gox's part.
This may happen a lot.  Same phantom BTC on gox end may fail multiple times with double-spend error. 
So summing up all the failed transaction totals doesn't really indicate how much was stolen...
But gox likely can compute how much the thieves walked away with.  It's possible it's just the sum of all the transactions they (erroneously) thought were rejected because they were missing from the blockchain.  And I'd wager it's a HUGE amount.  This may have been going on for weeks or months.  It may be on the order of tens of thousands of bitcoins.. and gox may actually have severe solvency issues at this point due to the missing coin.
Hopefully gox was smart and bought up BTC when it plunged to $500 today to make up some of the difference and partially recover from this disaster (for gox).

There is every incentive for an exchange to fake volume and trades and very few incentives to not do so right now. Manipulating volume and price attracts users and profit.
Not doing so can lead to a dead exchange. Especially if all the other exchanges are faking it!
And it's a slippery slope. All it takes is manipulating price and volume once for an exchange operator to "get hooked". It's like tasting crack. You go back...
I'd be surprised if any of the major exchanges out there DON'T manipulate price and volume. 
But don't tell anyone...

You might get away with not declaring BTC income but you're playing russian roulette with your life and freedom.
I'd be very careful.  
Also if you are paid in BTC and plan on trying to evade that part of the tax liability -- find out exactly how much your employer is declaring to the IRS that he is paying you.  If he's declaring that BTC portion of your income as salary expense to the IRS, then you probably should pay the taxes on it.. else the IRS may bill you for it (with penalty) or worse.
I wouldn't evade though.  It's not really worth it.  But to each his own.

Don't you think other traders are also in your situation?  It could explain why the price floated for as long as it did in the unrealistic $500-$600 range.  It's possible this isn't the bottom yet.  That there are many other people like you out there simply hoping they won't have to sell. There may be an even bigger crash coming as more traders decide to cut their heavy losses and get out.  You may not be alone in the universe.  In fact, the fact that this is the longest price slump in bitcoin history leads me to think others had kept betting that "the next big spike is a-comin'!".  It's what got us all into this mess.  We kept buying and buying and the market kept up the illusion that it had some umph in it.  In reality.. probably the bitcoin price deserves to be at $300 or even lower.. for now.  It'll probably bounce back.. SOMEDAY... just.. the question is when?
Can you wait 1 year? 2? 3? 5?  I could see the price being where it was before in 2 years.  Especially after the halving in 2016...
That being said I want to believe it will bounce back to something above $700 some day.  My cost basis is $700.  It sucks.  I'm down 50%.  I only put $10k in though, so if I lose all of it, so be it.

You're right. If I just want to jump right in NOW and buy some Bitcoins directly from someone.. With Bitalo I can do it in 10 minutes if I manage to find someone with the same bank.   Compare that to
other exchanges that require me to get validated and approved and with US bank
accounts, sending fiat to the exchange can take DAYS!
Would be cool if your website also listed the bank name and country for each seller so I as a buyer can factor that into my buying decision.  Do you do this?
Also regarding the 2 transactions.. I am having trouble understanding their exact purpose. Can you go into a concrete example now? Say I'm selling 10 BTC and some buyer, say Hans in Germany, agrees to pay me 4500€ for them. Can you illustrate what happens from start to finish?

Sure, all of that can happen with exchanges, of course.  
The only difference being that with banks right now it's part of the inherent design of the system to use debt to create money.  It's how loans WORK.
With an exchange "cooking the books", as you say, or a mining company lending out coins -- there's only so many coins you can lend out that way before you risk a bank run.  With a bank, you can lend out infinite $$$, because, well, you create new $$$ every time you lend. 
I wasn't advocating for one or the other, merely pointing out that exchanges/miners would have a limited capability to lend as compared to fiat banks.

Good insight. The waspy thing is probably at play here. There is a tendency to segregate, label, mark as lesser in the waspy mentality. They are closet elitists. Or overt elitists.

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:23:08
Well, because gox is the only exchange that has a broken implementation which ignores transaction malleability (which is a known "feature" of the bitcoin protocol).  Basically GOX fucked up bigtime.  Big bug in their systems.
Other exchanges weren't so dumb.
That's the basic explanation. :)
And I believe bitcoin developers have been aware of the issue and have proposed fixes but it's considered inconvenient to fix because they have to change policy on the protocol level and it may create larger issues as older clients communicate with new clients than the problem that it is fixing (which everyone knows to work around anyway).
It probably will be fixed sooner rather than later now that this problem got so much press coverage, though.  :)

@_date: 2014-03-26 00:29:27
1. No (only when you sell or spend them do you owe tax.  No tax owed for holding).
2. Yes.  If the bitcoin's price went up between when you bought it and when you spent it on said good or service, the difference is taxable (capital gains).
3. Oooo.  Good question!  I would think it kicks in twice.  Once when you received the BTC at the BTC price at the time, then again you adjust (for gains and/or losses) when you spend it.  So if that $5 worth of BTC goes up to $10, you are taxed on $5 income and $5 capital gains.  But if it stayed at $5 it would just be $5 income and $0 capital gains.  Or if it went down to $3, you would be taxed on $5 income and get to deduct a $2 capital loss.

The market could be pricing in the risk associated with how dodgy and shady they are.
Also if it were hard to get fiat IN and OUT, in theory the market should show this as an elevated price due to limited supply of fiat and a preference to convert value to BTC for withdrawal.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:01:23
Wow!  I am so glad you found it!  You're good man.  Yeah I just posted it yesterday.
I know what you mean about the resume option!  I often wanted this in my testing.  It's not *too* that hard to implement and doesn't even require a checkpoint file.  It just needs 1 number actually to do a resume.  I can make it so when you abort it prints a message that tells you what to pass to it next time you run it to resume where it left off.  Now that you and I both want this feature I can make it happen!
Regarding your second questions: yeah sorry the --chunk option is not very user friendly.  Basically think of it this way:
This option is designed when you are running across multiple machines (T machines), and you want each machine to process one piece of the keyspace (so that together they can explore the whole space).
It breaks up the keyspace to search into T chunks, and to each program that you execute will execute piece N (pieces start being counted at 0 all the way up to T-1).
So if you ran it on 2 boxes the options would be: 
--chunk=0/2  # on box 
--chunk=1/2  # on box 
So i think your --chunk=500/1000 option probably isn't that useful.. BUT, you can be creative with this chunk option to only explore part of the keyspace (so, for example, you can randomly explore parts of the keyspace, hoping "luck" is in  your favor and you hit the jackpot, by executing the program multiple timpes with RANDOM_NUMBER/1000 each time, you will explore 1/1000 th of the keyspace each time, which piece?  Well, RANDOM_NUMBER is the piece you are exploring and you can do it to "play the lotto" with the keyspace..!).
Is the above explanation helpful?
Ha ha yeah regarding the charset -- good detective work on your part to at least determine he has a standard US keyboard.  I'm basically using that charset too.  I also assumed he typed the chars on his keyboard and isn't being a douche and using obscure unicode or funky euro characters.  But you never know!

All good points!
Yes wallets are technically collections of private keys.  The exact collection you own or control is definitely not publicly visible.  Although in some cases it can be partially inferred due to the way the reference client implements Change addresses. But yes he would have been better off clarifying that wallets are collections of keys, and that addresses and their keys are the important thing when it comes to the ledger.  Wallets are just a client-side implementation detail.
Good point about the capping. You are right that it is entrely unchartered territory
He may have not been entirely incorrect though because he may have been talking about the "limited supply" issue when he hand-waved it as a red herring. With regular currency that can only be subdivided into 100 units, a limited supply ultimately limits economic growth. With bitcoin perhaps he was saying that the potentially infinite divisibility means economic growth should never be stifled by scarcity of the currency.

Ok so the first transaction, the "split" transaction has output A (for 10BTC) go to the Bitalo "escrow" wallet or back to buyer or what? Or to seller wallet?
What does the seller see during this time? And the buyer?

I think fiat will coexist alongside Bitcoin, a gold and fiat co-exist today.  BTC will be deflationary and fiat will continue to be inflationary.  No reason for BTC to totally supplant fiat, and I don't think this is likely given the huge advantage governments and central banks have when dealing with fiat which they control.
I live in Eastern Europe now.  Here, in Romania, which is part of the EU, there are 2 main currencies.  The Euro (EUR) is used for large transactions -- buying a car or a house or paying rent or whatnot -- and is more "international", and the LEU (RON) is used for small, day-to-day transactions.  Buying groceries, going to a restaurant, etc.  It's more local.
2 currencies can totally coexist side by side.

I personally think you have a point however what may also happen is if they regulate it to death in the first world like the US or UK, it may just pick up steam on the "second world"-- parts of Eastern Europe, North Africa, Latin America. These places have sufficient connectivity and incentive to use something like bitcoin. You can't stop an idea whose time has come. Even if you're the USA and/or MasterCard.  At best I hope all they can do is slow it down but not stop it.

Yeah but can you send someone $0.01?  Or even $0.0001?  Being able to send micro-payments might be something everyone will catch on to in the near future and might lead to new business models online.  Think about artists selling clipart for minimal payments per image.  Or a decent content site charging you a very tiny fee for its content. It's so cheap you don't even feel it.  But if millions of people hit the site, the admins make enough money to pay their bills and continue to produce content.
It allows for a more active economy ultimately, this micro-payment thing.

Sure.  But it doesn't mean that the opposite is not true.  That is -- it really is still a very likely scenario that it was designed and conceived of my one man.
And in the end it comes down to a matter of opinion.  
I tend to think the simplest explanation is probably most likely, given the lack of institutional interest in a digital global currency.  It was a fringe area of research amongst a very fringe group of computer scientists at the time.  Why the elaborate ruse?  If a consortium of people were working on it, I doubt they would be so *good* at computer science *and* being amazingly good at the cloak and dagger kind of stuff required to convince everyone that it's 1 guy.  They did a great job of making it really believable that it was only 1 guy.  From the style of the emails, to the style of the code.  To the very many mistakes made early on that only got corrected because *other people* on a mailing list pointed them out.  It's all pretty well done, if it's a ruse.
Sure, you can say a government intelligence agency would be able to do both.  And it's hard to *disprove* that.  But lacking any real evidence and nothing to go on except for general distrust of governments and a vivid imagination.. I find it an unconvincing theory.   The more mundane theory -- that it was one genius obsessed with digital gold, seems to me to be more likely.

There's something really historically poetic about this. 
Copper gets its NAME from Cyrpus (Cu, cuprum, cipru, ciprio..or vice versa). In ancient times the copper mines of Cyprus supplied the Western world most of its copper.. For jewelry, weapons, technology.. And minted COINS.
The worlds money depended on the copper mines of Cyprus!
It's beautiful to see Cyrpus coming full-circle. And once again being an epicenter for the world's coins. This time, not made of copper, but made of bits and collective consensus. Beautiful.

Correct, but space (or rather, block size in bytes) is of concern to miners. In situations where two pools simultaneously produce a block, generally the smaller one (in bytes) has a slight advantage at "succeeding" and being universally accepted by the network, by virtue of the fact that being smaller, it can propagate faster due to reduced data transmission time.

Yes. That was wrong. He should have gone to greater lengths to clarify that. It's a common source of confusion for everybody.
Although conceptually you may as well say try are "stored" there -- since as an end user that is the apparent behavior (with the exception that multiple copies of the same wallet, as if by magic, all spend their "stored" Bitcoins simultaneously).  
The more correct (and simpler) conceptual model is to talk about what actually happens.  A wallet is a collection of "account numbers" and keys and the storage of the coins is on the ledger (blockchain). Spending involves using a key to submit a signed transaction authorizing the movement of coins from input to output addresses. Hence the magic of all wallet-clones "spending" the same coins simultaneously.
Good point.

But then again they can just parse/scan the blockchain in realtime whenever a transaction "disappears" and catch suspect malleable transactions and do extra sanity checks to decide if they actually went through or not....

Yep.  Stated elegantly as well.
But I am saying he's subverting bitcoin because he snuck it in with other patches thus decreasing the likelihood people have a choice.  And when people complain about it, he's resisting it.
Any other developer would have split this patchset in two, say have a "ljr" flag for his useful stuff, and a "letsbreakbitcoin" flag for this stuff (which is off by default).  This way, it's pretty obvious what's going on.  He's being unresponsive to feedback and needlessly bullheaded.

Sure, that's true.  But, in my ideal world that probably will never exist: It's not always taxation: depends the rate you print money at.  Ideally the government would print money at the "proper" rate to match the real economy.  Even if it's off by a few percentage points per year, it would hardly be as abusive and destructive as our current system (which gets just about everything wrong).

Well, you can work around this issue.
For example, signing a transaction to issue the "sell" order puts the funds temporarily in an escrow/exchange-controlled single-sig wallet.  If the order is cancelled, funds get sent back to your multisig wallet.  If the order executes funds get forwarded to buyer's multisig wallet and the exchange credits your account with fiat.
The only "inconvenience" here is that issuing the sell order may have a slight delay before it's "seen" by the bitcoin network (a few seconds), and you have to input your key (although it may be stored browser-side as a sort of convenience) when issuing a sell order.
This is totally feasibly and doable.  It would generate a fuckton of transactions though, is the only real issue.
Might be better to actually coalesce transactions performed during a day (or at the end of the day) into a real blockchain wallet, to prove solvency, but not to have every transaction rely on the blockchain, in practice.
But in principle this is 100% doable.  I'm surprised there isn't some exchange doing this already.  The marketing appeal of this is huge.
The exchange would still of course need to hold fiat.  But at least they aren't holding fiat *and* your motherfucking bitcoins (as karpeles did).  Means they can only really steal fiat (and that's harder to steal actually, because of banks, but still not impossible).

That's not the *main* reason (I'd say the main reason is most people don't give a shit or know any better), but it's certainly an obstacle to overcome.
You can overcome this obstacle by signing up for business class service from your ISP (it's more expensive of course), or by buying a $20/mo linux box account on some cloud server and setting up your email server there.

I like the idea of a wooden bat. 
I sort of envision beating him so hard and long with it that the bat eventually splinters and shatters into hundreds of pieces.  This provides a finite termination point to the beating.  
Otherwise, with an aluminum (in American English, in British it's 'aluminium'), you run the risk of beating him incessantly because the bat would never break and thus you don't know when to stop beating upon his loathsome head and body.
However, if you have the discipline to control when you stop administering the beating (something I for one definitely would lack in this case), then by all means, go ahead and beat him with whatever material bat you choose, including aluminum.  Aluminum has the advantage that it's much easier to clean.. and it hurts more.

There is a vote of sorts in that all clients (not just miners) accept or reject blocks (based on whether they are valid or whether there is a fork and the height is higher/lower).

A friend of mine who is a weed dealer in Calgary, Canada (and who accepts bitcoin!) told me about it and about silk road. I checked it out back in 2010 (or maybe it eas early 2011)..even did mining for a few hours (made like 1 BTC woo!), and then I forgot about it.
I should have done more mining and bought some BTC on Gox in'11.  Hindsight is 20/20..
I initially didn't know what to think about bitcoin and sort of shrugged, hoping it would succeed, but not really believing it would.
After I saw the price steadily climb and more and more people get interested in it.. I realized it has a strong chance of changing the world. 
Heard an Andreas podcast with Joe Rogan.. And I decided to buy in (late!).  This was in Feb. 2014.

I understand your point completely. I even agree with you that SatoshiDICE is spammy and wasteful. 
But what you are doing is or can be pereceived as unjustly leveraging your privileged position as package maintainer to advance your personal tastes and beliefs.
You have a special position as maintainer of the bitcoin ebuild and even though SatoshiDICE are slightly evil, you really shouldn't use your ability to influence what code people run in this way. It's simply more evil than the evil you are trying to stop.
The lesser of two evils really is to just "let it be". Here's why: the big draw of bitcoin, aside from it being amazingly cool, really awesome technology and potentially very convenient.. Really is absolute freedom. And that means anyone can transact on the block chain as they see fit, without barriers. That's one of the big values of bitcoin. 
By using your influence to affect the probability that the overall network ends up dropping/ignoring some transactions, that limitless freedom is slightly skewed now. It's eroded a little. And as a result, all of bitcoin suffers.  No longer do we have a completely free, 100% uncensored system, because some actors such as yourself are using their influence to make some legal transactions harder.
Perhaps what you are doing is for the greater good. Perhaps this forces people like SatoshiDICE to pay attention and modify their code to not be as spammy.
But you have to admit .. That to the rest of us, it really feels oligarchical, what you are doing. Many of us consider 10GB of extra block chain as a small price to pay for freedom. Even if it means spammers like SatoshiDICE have to exist.
For that reason, I ask you to consider making the "spam filter" default to OFF in your ebuild. Even if you hate SatoshiDICE. Do it for bitcoin, for freedom, and for Gentoo.

@_date: 2014-02-10 10:48:08
I can explain it like you're 16.
The way I understand it:
1. Transaction goes into blockchain with a hashid.  This is like a social security number or unique identifier or whatever for the transaction.  It's the name given to the transaction so you it can be identified later, if you wanna know what the fuck is up with it. 
2. Let's say you want to send 1.0 BTC to your external wallet.  GOX issues a transaction to the blockchain and it gets a unique number, say 
3. A malicious miner can intercept this block before it's committed to the blockchain and modify the hash of the transaction if they have enough cpu power.  So what GOX thought of as transaction  gets rewritten to transaction  by the malicious miner, and validated as such in the blockchain.
4. The bitcoin still gets sent through and transaction  succeeds (although now it's referred to as  by the blockchain due to malicious miner).  No double spend.  But GOX can't tell what the fuck happened! To them, they just see transaction  as having disappeared.  To them it appears as if the transaction was rejected by the blockchain because transaction  doesn't exist.  Instead transaction  exists in the blockchain (which GOX ignores because who the fuck cares about  right?  GOX was worried about  not  so exchange gives up and assumes transaction failed, refunding your BTC in their own internal bookkeeping.  However the actual BTC is gone.. it's in your external wallet. But exchange doesn't know this and assumes they still got it.  
5. In the meantime your GOX accounts shows it has that 1.0 BTC (because GOX fucked up and assumed transaction failed), while your external wallet also has the real 1.0 BTC.   We can say GOX has a fake 1.0 BTC that doesn't exist anymore!  You can then go ahead and sell your fake 1.0 BTC that is living inside GOX's mind only.. you can sell it to someone else on the exchange for fiat, and use the fiat to buy a (hopefully) real BTC.  Or you can just cash out the fiat.  When the person that bought the fake imaginary 1.0 BTC that GOX could have swore still exists.. when they try to transfer it our.. they will get the double spend error.. because, you know, as far a the blockchain is concerned.. that 1.0 BTC doesn't exist at GOX...  Tee hee.  
6. This "apparent double-spend" only applies to accounts/bookkeeping *within* exchanges that aren't careful to trap for this error.  *NOT* to the blockchain itself!!
7. Apparently trapping for this error is extremely time consuming and inefficient and a scalable solution has to be found, or the bitcoin software itself needs to be modified to catch this error.

or at least the oligarchies controlling their laws.
Taxation itself is dumb.  It's a vestige of backward thinking about the nature of money and how to run an economy.  Governments don't even really need to tax their populations at all.  They already can print infinite money anyway, and often do beyond the tax rate (national debt anyone?).
Money is a concept -- it represents will and stored economic power.  Governments can just issue money to their payees infinitely as a sort of "money source".  They do this anyway in the modern world.  Money sinks like taxation are fairly useless and are actually a burden on economic activity.

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:26:03
Well basically the exploiter taking advantage of the bug in gox's system gets gox to send them BTC (by withdrawing BTC to an external wallet).  The BTC makes it to the attacker's wallet, but gox thinks the BTC never made it (because it never gets the txid it was expecting confirmed).  Gox believes it still has the BTC it sent, but in reality it doesn't.. the real BTC is in the attacker's wallet.
Later on the same user/attacker can then "sell" their BTC for fiat and cash out.  
Attacker gets to keep his BTC and get fiat for it at the same time.  Or he can exchange "fake" BTC for real BTC within the exchange and rinse and repeat, effectively stealing as much BTC as he wants to until the exchange runs out of BTC or notices the bug.  
Which is what happened.. basically.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:30:55
(3) true.  All it requires is the user have a lower latency to some mining pool than GOX has, so they can inject the modified transaction before gox's version makes it to the pool!
(5) it is a double-spend later.  Same BTC that gox thought it had in its hot wallet no longer exist in gox's wallet according to the official blockchain.  People were getting double-spend errors all last week because gox's wallet was fu&gt;&lt;0red and not in synch with the blockchain, due to this very issue.
(7) Correct, they fucked up.  Or they are manipulating the market.  But I suspect just pure stupidity because of their history with being stupid in the past.

Wise words. Enjoy the people in your life and life itself.

You probably can hold a USD balance on the site but can't cash out with USD.  You need to ultimately convert your USD balance to BTC and cash out with that.

I'd say their strange behavior intentionally caused fear and doubt. Surely gox knew that their shitty press release would cause the price to plummet. This is normally a bad thing for any exchange because it could lead to people walking away from BTC.
It's only a good thing if you're insolvent in BTC and want to buy BTC cheap.  Thus you issue a crap press release, crash the price, and eventually hope to minimize the BTC you are short by buying them at half price.
I'd say you're spot on.  Their actions lead us to suspect this is exactly what they're doing.
What's really amazing to me is how bad their programmers must be to deviate do significantly from standard practice with bitcoin. Every other exchange on the planet programs around transaction malleability, since it's a known "feature".  But not

Well, to be honest, I think for some people in some situations paper/coin money may still be around for a while.  It certainly is very low tech, and instant.  No electricity required!  
In some situations you just can't get to your bitcoins at all. Granted, in the future those situations may become increasingly rare, and the security benefits offered by bitcoin are impressive indeed (*if* done right!).
The physical bitcoins, complete with a private key if you remove a sticker or something, are a neat idea, and may be the best of both worlds.
I never understood what's to stop someone from tampering with them.. to get the private key off them without anyone knowing (or the issuer from stealing the 1 BTC from the private key).  But they are at least made out of a precious metal that's worth something.  So it's a nice hybrid actually!
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:47:40
Right. But at the same time one of the risks for Bitcoin is governments and institutions openly opposed to it and banning all commerce in it. A worst-case scenario would be crypto currencies being contrabanded to the extent that drugs are, for example.
A (European!) world government officially ok'ing it does wonders for allaying those risks and building confidence in bitcoin.
If 1 world government jumps on board others may as well. Thus making it increasingly harder for London or Wall Street to effectively ban bitcoin.

You're right, the current money system relies on perpetual inflation by design.
I meant to say it acts to dampen inflation (since too much of it
can be disastrous).
Also taxation acts as part of the obfuscating, confusing scheme in place to confuse people about what's really happening and to also make it seem more legitimate.
Taxation on the local level does actually pay for things, which is why city and state governments generally are unable to operate at a deficit in perpetuity without going bankrupt.

I did set a few people up with wallets already and it has been a very rewarding experience.
I will say though that right now Btcoin is a first world toy, sadly.
I keep thinking there is more I can do in general to change things, just don't know what would have the greatest impact, if anything.  Hell if Bill Motherfuckjg Gates is finding it hard to change the world -- I really am not sure I individually have a huge shot.

No.  Just that a double-spend is possible WITHIN an exchange's own internal bookkeeping.
Like if the exchange isn't wary, it may seem like a transaction didn't go through when in fact it did.

If you have enough money arbitrage is enormously profitable still.  Sometimes the difference between BTCe and Bitstamp can be $10 or more per BTC.  With enough funds in each of the two exchanges, you can completely take advantage of that difference and make bank.
You need lots of funds both to make lots of money per unit time and also as a way to circumvent the "delays" inherent in moving BTC to/from the exchanges and the super-slow delays in moving fiat to/from the exchanges.  The large funds act like a buffer for this.

I honestly can't imagine BTC not growing in price in 1 years time.  So I'm chill.  Even though at this point I've lost $2000 since buying 10 BTC at roughly $700, I'm ok.  I can't imagine the price staying like this forever. 
Especially not since it's still growing, wall street has begin to be interested (saw a post about some sort of BTC Trust that is filing for license form the SEC).

Because frankly exhanges can and should do better.
They maybe should try and use the blockchain as much as possible.  Say, at the end of every day or every hour, 'commit' transactions made to the blockchain.
Or have trades use a 2-key authentication scheme (one of the keys is not stored on the exchange but in your browser, for example).
Any number of ways to make them more "on the blockchain", thus making the blockchain itself be proof of solvency.
Andreas is right.  And many exchanges can do better.

I'm a big fan of the following for my cold storage:
- Generate an address offline on a very secure box using a command-line tool
- Encrypt private key with a BIP0038 passphrase that I will never ever forget
- Can store encrypted private key digitally in a secure digital location with few worries.  Can even write it on the sky.  Good passphrase + BIP0038 is secure enough that even NSA will have trouble cracking it.
- Optionally, print out unencrypted private key and store in bank vault or somesuch so if I die theoretically relatives can have access to my precious BTC.

I think gox was stupid and they got robbed for not using industry standard practices in implementing their transaction handling.
It's an error on their part so huge it may have cost them millions of dollars!
They fucked up so big.. and in such a humiliating manner, that they are *forced* to shut down all BTC transfers out because they are losing thousands of coin per day, likely, due tot his bug.
At this embarrassing point for them, all they can do is point fingers.  I think they are short perhaps tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin.
I think we ain't heard the last (or worst) of this.  I think this exploit may mean we will hear gox has lost lots of money, and bitcoin may have a second wave of price drop (and hopefully recovery) when we get this news.
So be prepared.  The shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan yet.

You may be very right actually.  There is nothing to stop exchanges (especially iffy Chinese ones) from colluding to manipulate the market.  In fact, they have every incentive to do so.  Being unregulated has its drawbacks!

The blockchain references previous transaction outputs as inputs. So you can definitely trace them because it's how the ledger is constructed.  All a  bitcoin in your wallet really is, is a reference to a transaction where that bitcoin came in as 1 or more outputs from one or more previous transactions.  When you spend it, your transaction's inputs are a previous transactions's outputs.
That beind said.. You can obfuscate this using a tumbler where you mix up the Bitcoins so much that it's not provable from the ledger which specific bitcoin came from where.  (this anonymizes the Bitcoins).

Right now with 25 BTC block rewards the "inflation" of bitcoin is about 10% a year.  It'll drop down to 4% when the block reward is halved in 2016. 
In the 4-year period since 2012 when the block reward went to 25, bitcoin will have experienced a ~40% inflation in the number of coins.

We really don't know. Could very well have been manipulation (wouldn't put it past Karpeles -- he had the method and the motive), or it could be a fluke due to some outside investor.
My personal "gut" says its more likely fraud, knoing how unscrupulous Karpeles is .. and how insolvent Gox was, perhaps Karpeles decided to put up a fight and somehow manipulate price to get Gox solvent again.

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:37:30
Well in the long term I think BTC has nothing to worry about and the price will definitely soar even higher than we've seen it soar.
And also in the long term it's actually a good thing for GOX to die a flaming death for all of bitcoin, since their bullshit has been hurting confidence.
But in the short term this bit of strange/bad news will shake confidence and lead to price drops.  Everyone sells even if they know it's bullshit (like what happened today), because they know confidence is bad and the price is sure to drop.  It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy in trading.  You can exploit "bad" news to get more BTC.  As soon as bad news hits, SELL SELL SELL!  
Convert all your BTC to fiat at the beginning of the expected drop (shortly after the bad news hits the presses), then watch the price plummet as everyone else does the same, then wait for what you think is the bottom, then BUY BUY BUY.  You are almost guaranteed to walk away in a stronger position than when you started if executed correctly.
And yes, good point about the FUDing.  It was obvious FUDing, so they must have a motive behind it (or they are just incredibly bad at public relations, which is also a possibility).  I suspect it's as you say, they wanted to buy up coins cheap to make up the difference.
And I agree.. long term BTC is bullish.  I'm a die-hard believer the price and its adoption will skyrocket in coming months/years.

For small value items (the bill at a restaurant, a beer, a coffee, etc) it's probably less risk than what you get with credit cards.  
For large value items, it just takes 30 mins to wait for 3 confirmations.  If you're buying an airplane for a few million bucks, or a car, or a house, you can spare 30 minutes to make sure the payment went through fraudlessly.  If you're buying a latte, well, fuck, it's just a latte and 99.9999% of transactions get confirmed.  Only in rare cases do they not (0 tx fee, or maybe double spend attack, etc).

Quite often the mining rig companies are actually scamming their customers.  
Most state-of-the-art mining rigs require you to pre-order them and pay for them in advance.  Then, when they are manufactured, you are put in a queue to get your rig (based on how early you pre-ordered).
There is reason to believe at least one company, ButterFly labs, *DOESN'T* ship the rigs out when they are ready.  Instead, it uses them to mine for a month or two, and then it ships our the rigs, once they become slightly obsolete, to its customers.
Evidence of this is numerous reports all over the world form people that got their rigs from ButterFly Labs, and they were obviously used and showed signs of wear and tear.
Not to mention very late deliveries of hardware.
The dishonest mining rig companies are basically getting customers to absorb the risk and cost of manufacturing new hardware, which they themselves get to use to "print" money (for a limited time).  It's pretty insidious but happens quite often, especially with ButterFly Labs.

Strictly speaking you aren't affect decisions about the validity of blocks, sure.  So it wouldn't produce a fork.  However, if you are blacklisting the relaying of transactions you're affecting the network in such a way so that certain transactions run the risk of never making it into the block chain.  This affects the consensus system indirectly.  Perfectly valid transactions (from the point of view of the official bitcoin protocol) have an increased probability of never happening.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:34:35

Well specifically I interpret "regulation" as "finance regulation".  Normal laws and property rights are always in effect anyway, even for bitcoin (or should be!).
As for finance regulation: every finance guy I've ever talked to that is also into bitcoin thinks regulation (as we have now in the United States in the finance sector) is a horrible idea.  Regulation basically a big bureaucratic system that doesn't even do what it's supposed to do (catch crooks!).  It's an anti-lubricant to efficient business.  And we have to pay for that generated inefficiency.  Watch Bruce Fenton's recent talk:

No, it wasn't.  Ideally it should be treated as an investment when it's an investment (a brokerage account) and as currency when you're just using it to buy stuff.
If you're using it as a currency and you pay taxes as if it were an investment it's extremely cumbersome and discourages use as a currency. This is because you have to declare EACH TIME you spend it as a realized gain/loss.
In cases where you buy bitcoin and spend them on stuff, then it's easier to not have to figure out the capital gains/losses with respect to the DOLLAR on the bitcoin.  
If you buy EUROS or British Pounds and use them to buy stuff, you don't have to declare capital gains/losses.  It's just considered normal use of a currency.  Even if during that time the pound appreciated with respect to the dollar.

It sucks but I keep thinking the price HAS to go up. I may be laughing in a year. Or crying. I've prepared myself for either extreme. Or.. Maybe price won't do much in a year.. And we'll still be teetering in the 4,5,600's.  Who knows?  Isn't this EXCITING tho?!?

To be honest, trolling that gold is useless sounds so bizarre.  About 10,000 years of history agree gold has had universal value.  I recall descriptions of Roman generals transporting massive amounts of gold to pay for wheat and supplies for their troops.  Alexander the Great needed to fund his wars with gold.  Gold is pretty fucking well-established as a universal store of value.
To argue that it's essentially not that sounds a bit anti-common-sense, even if in some abstract way the trader may have a point.

Except the miners consciously chose to do it, as is their right.
What luke-jr did was snuck in his changes into a larger patch, turned them on by default, didn't document it, and refused to change it initially when challenged. 
He abused his ability to influence what code gets installed on hundreds of thousands of computers. He is in a position of power as a gentoo maintainer and basically abused it by increasing the odds that his sneaky blacklisting code gets installed on as many machines as possible. 
Sure, you can turn it OFF.. But many people never knew about it and weren't presented with a choice. There are thousands of USE flags in gentoo and most people don't spend time reading all the docs to each one. And even if they do, in this case the blacklist wasn't documented. You had to read the source.  How many gentoo users read the sourcecode for EVERY USE flag they use? Probably a fraction of a percent if that.
It's likely that in many cases people that would have otherwise not wanted the blacklist got t by default and were none the wiser.
That's shenanigans and abuse of influence.

Currently it is not the most free society, unfortunately. Neither culturally nor politically.
What IS stiill fairly functional and "free" in the USA is the business culture. Americans as a rule are extremely progressive and open to new ideas in business. Also access to credit and capital is amazing in the USA.  It's easy to get a bank to give you a loan for your business idea or to convince (competent, expert) investors to help you get your idea off the ground. The USA is amazing in this regard and I dare say truly the best

Yeah I get it now -- "I am smart, so that's why I did well" may be a false/dangerous belief to have since it can cloud your vision about what really happened.  "I did good work, so I did well" may be a better explanation.
However, I guess my point was that *also*, believing you are smart is a useful belief (if it's not entirely untrue).
There is some inherent value in beliefs about yourself.  *Believing* you are a certain thing can help you become that thing.  You defend the belief, align your actions to make it true.  A sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.  A kind of "the secret"/"fake it till you make it" kind of thing, which actually works and can give one inner strength.

Well the entire philosophy of bitcoin is decentralization of trust.
You can have a hybrid exchange that also utilizes the blockchain, perhaps not in realtime, but it can periodically "commit" user holdings to the blockchain (perhaps using some multisig wallet system), and then when you want to trade, you move coins into a single-sig wallet that the exchange controls, for example.

Lots of the big mail providers have colluded together to prevent spam.  It means they have white-lists of other mail servers and/or ip-address ranges they consider "not spam", then they have tiers of ip-addresses that are "probably not spam" and then there's home use internet service, which they consider "likely spam".
If mail originates from a server in the last categoy, you may have trouble sending it without it ending up in people's spam boxes or worse, getting flat out rejected.
I *think* there's a way to get onto a whitelist, though, even if you are in that category.
They revoke your whitelist status if you're found to be sending spam though.  At least that's how it *used* to work last time I looked into it.
An example: So yahoo!'s mail servers receive an email from your mail server, which has an IP address associated with comcast or roadruner time warner or something, and it may look questionable to yahoo, because, well, it's coming from a home computer.  Yahoo will assume it's a home computer that's been virused and may refuse to receive the mail or may place it in the spam box of the recipient automatically.  Thus your little homegrowm mail server is going to have trouble sending emails to people on yahoo or google because they basially will treat your emails as spam.
There are ways around this.  The aforementioned whitelisting.  Or you can just buy a $20/mo corporate cloud server and set up your mail server there, rather than run it off your cablemodem connection.
Or you can get business class cablemodem account at home.  IP addresses from business class accounts are EXPECTED to possibly run a mail server, so they rarely get blacklisted outright.
Moral of the story: It's still not too hard to setup a mail server, provided you take spam filters into account and do it properly.

I think in the coming years we're going to see huge growth in this space. Basically off-chain payment processors (like coinbase) that periodically submit transactions to the blockchain in reduced form.
This in the end may mean bitcoin will resemble a hybrid system where you have trusted third parties (like the banking system), but at its core it will be decentralized, and no one party will control the underpinnings, which is the consensus-based blockchain.  
So profound a concept, this blockchain. It's really the natural
Evolution from what we have now.. Which is a quasi-consensus based system (the Fed and banks sort of agreeing on stuff, but being able to subvert it on a whim.. And us common folk being just pawns in their game with zero choice or ability to change anything).

Very possible.
Someone else pointed out that if gox were intending to defraud their customers, they could also hide behind a transaction malleability as a credible excuse to walk away with millions of dollars in their customer's bitcoins.  All the while claiming some hackers stole the BTC using this "exploit" (which is really a bug in gox's systems).  (It might even hold up in court should customers try to sue them later?).
Why they would do this when bitcoin is a growing internet phenomenon is beyond me.  Seems more profitable to stay in the business in the hopes that gox will be the facebook of BTC in 5 years.
But it's at least not impossible to consider.. if you wanna be paranoid.

Probably the worst thing about no more CO2 is that it could lead to a runaway ice age/snowball earth, because CO2 is a greenhouse gas and when it's absent the Earth cools significantly.  And then you have problems as that kills off most life, thus ensuring zero CO2 in perpetuity.

I've also heard theories that it could be a mining company or consortium trying to keep the price down to drive competition out of business. It may be cheaper for them to waste a few million dollars in bitcoin (let's say they could have gotten $400/coin instead of $300) than to use other tactics to destroy competition.  It's an iffy theory, but it holds a little water.  Spend $3 million today in lost profit on bitcoin sales to kill your competitors, and make $30 million tomorrow because you control the mining and are making tons of BTC per day.

- Seller has wallet S, a multisig wallet where one of the keys is at Bitalo.
- Buyer has his wallet on his home computer
- seller signed a transaction for 10BTC from wallet S to? Where? A second wallet S2 which is multisig as well?
- seller also signs a lock time transaction from S2 to... A 100% controlled Bitalo wallet but this tx has lock time 2 weeks and will be used only if there is a dispute.
- at this point funds are "frozen" in S2, which acts as a sort of multi-sig escrow.
- seller gets his fiat, confirms on website and signs transaction from S2 to buyer wallet (thus invalidating the locktime tx)
- if seller gets no fiat, and dispute not solved, then that locked tx is issued and Bitalo gets the coins from S2, at which point it can decide to award coins back to seller's S wallet?

EDIT: They may very well not have the bitcoins that they owe to their customers!  It's entirely possible the hackers used this exploit of gox's system to walk away with a fortune in BTC.  Shit may hit the fan very very bad on this one.  You ain't seen nothing yet.

2 spaces after full stops died with the typewriter. For online communications and most writing 1 space is considered correct.
2 spaces is what I was taught and it's what I still do out of habit half the time. It takes me still some effort to not do 2 spaces. But look it up--it's no longer "right".

Paging @_date: 2014-02-20 15:02:48
Yeah that's what I don't get.  Shit they make a killing on trades.  1% of 10,000 BTC exchanged on a very slow day is 100 BTC!  That's $60,000.  On heavy days it can be 10x that.  That's not chump change.  And their costs are probably pretty minimal -- I mean a bunch of servers, some programmers, some office staff.  Hell a real exchange needs a whole team of lawyers and needs lots of capital to get started for law fees, etc.
I don't get what the fuck.  Gox was the  exchange of the  crypto currency which has huge growth potential.  Why they would choose the thievery road and steal from their customers defies logic.
So yeah.. maybe you're right.  I'm hoping you're right.  But their behavior right now is either incredibly incompetent at best -- and most likely reeks to me of something fishy going on.

No, you are incorrect.  
In order for being able to pull this off you need to inject the modified transaction into a block before the legitimate transaction is seen by a significant mining pool, in the hopes that one of the big pools puts it in the next block that it solves, and that the legitimate transaction gets omitted (because it is a dupe).
Here is a post that came out today on a bitcoin blog about this very topic:

Not tin foil hat.  It's pretty certain gox was robbed massively by whomever exploited their buggy software.
And yes, at this point it's entirely in their best interest for the price of BTC to be as low as fucking possible for them to be able to meet their obligations to their legitimate clients and hand them over the bitcoins that are theirs (which were stolen).
So yes, every fucking reason right now for gox to crash the price.  And every fucking reason for them to pray it stays down so they can recover and not go bankrupt tomorrow.
Sad for them.  But it's their fuckup.

Because you are.  Gox isn't (or shouldn't be) a bank.  Banks hand out loans to people, which is why they have what are called fractional reserves.  
Exchanges don't.
Every BTC that was ever bought on there is exchanged for *REAL* fiat.  That means that fiat came from someone's actual bank account and was deposited into gox.  The price fluctuates according to such exchanges of *REAL* fiat for crypto-currency.
And... every single shiny BTC that was ever sold on there has the same history -- it ultimately was deposited there from someone's wallet.
It's a zero-sum system. 
(With the minor exception of the exchange fee which means the exchange gets a cut of every trade for their operating costs, etc).
I don't get why so many people find this so hard to understand.

Well part of gold's value is its scarcity, sure.
Also, it has some market forces driving its value up. The fact that it's traded heavily and perceived as a good historical store lends it towards people hoarding it as a value store.
There are other metals rarer than gold that are cheaper, but they lack the same perceived status as gold, so market/hoarding forces don't affect their price as much if at all. This Wikipedia page lists some valuable metals and their market price. As you can see other metals much rarer are much cheaper than gold.  
The thing that sort of scares me about bitcoin is it does have some weaknesses now (such as transaction volume limits, still not very nub friendly).  If some really slick alt coin comes out with a halfway decent marketing budget it could weaken btc's "scarcity"... That is, the scarcity is a little "artificial".
I guess the same argument can be made for "alt" metals, and so far gold
is still.. Well.. The Gold Standard for precious metals. :)
Do you think that BTC will always the the "gold standard"

Nice prediction and it makes sense.
Of course spreading out the buying so that it's done a few hundred BTC at a time may not pump the price THAT much (at least
Not to 99999 or whatever), but it may very well make it higher than the current market price, at least temporarily.

Google bitcoin bootstrap.dat.
You can download (via BitTorrent) a partial copy of the block
Chain.  You put it in your bitcoin directory and restart the client and it
imports blocks from that file. It saves a bit of time but not too much.. Since a lot of the delay with synching with the block chain seems to be CPU and disk access. But it does go slightly faster if you use that file.  Google it if interested... Or I can paste a link here but I'm on my mobile now and a bit lazy.

Good point.  "Viruses" (that is, malicious computer programs that replicate themselves to infect other hosts) as it were aren't common at all on mac and possible non-existent "in the wild", at least according to Apple and anti-virus companies.
Trojans on the other hand.. well.. there are plenty.  And I'd argue for a sufficiently gullible set of users trojans can spread fairly quickly as well -- they just aren't automated.  But can do all the things viruses do -- steal data (wallets!), hijack computers, participate in zombienets/DDoS, etc etc.

I thought about this too.  Absent regulation, it's entirely possible they are manipulating the price down, and we'd be none the wiser.  We'd just chalk it up to the crazy market.  It's similar to how GOX's WillyBot artificially pumped the price.
In the case of Gox, they knew they could never ever make back the BTC they lost, so they opted to cash out in fiat with the little BTC they did have, so they pumped the price as high as possible.
Bitstamp on the other hand is doing the opposite because they want to buy back the BTC they lost to meet customer obligations (I guess this means they are solvent, for the most part).
It crossed my mind and would explain a helluva lot.

Well you could get on Bitstamp or btc-e and sell them right before you think the price may tank again (then rebuy when it hits bottom).  Of course you never know quite when that will be but waiting for news to come out is always a good way to do it.
It's a gamble.. but it's a good way to turn 2 bitcoins into 2.2 BTC if the price tanks 10% and you buy at the bottom...

Yes. And it's a pain in the ass paperwork-wise because you have to send the IRS a bunch of shit.
But I think even if you pay no tax in the country of residence you are eligible for a huge tax credit anyway.
Get a US accountant that doesn't mind working remotely with you via email/etc and he can handle it all for you.
I can put you in touch with my accountant if you like. He's a Greek guy with a small firm in Queens, NY. A really great guy that knows how to deduct like a mofo.  PM me if you want more details. He charges $200 per filibg, and I file once a year.  Worth it to pay $0 in US taxes.

@_date: 2014-07-02 15:05:24
Yeah which is like.. not much of a deal on the face of it, right?
But.. if you think about it: What would happen if you TRIED to buy 30,000+ bitcoins all in 1 day or in a relatively short span of time? Chances are only the first few hundred could be had at the current price of ~$640.. the more you buy the more the price shoots up -- it could even make everyone run up the market into the thousands.  Buying them all at once at an auction ensures you get them all for a set price without a big run and then a subsequent potential crash.  At least.. that's my guess as to why you'd do that rather than buying them all slowly over the course of a few days or a week.
Although I suspect normally big whales also buy them that way (gradually), being careful to avoid pumping the price too much.
Ah.. I can't wait for more liquidity.. it will be harder and harder to push the market in either direction some day the more liquid bitcoin gets..

What about a world government maybe, trying to sabotage bitcoin?  Think some huge NSA datacenter with &gt;51% hashpower working hard to sabotage the blockchain.
If that happened, though, it would probably be a temporary bump-in-the-road and may lead to a temporary price drop, with a recovery after the situation is fixed/handled/countermeasures are implemented.

The U.S. Govt did seize their U.S. account assets. They then didn't have the fiat to cover customer balances. I think that's when Karpeles became tempted to "cheat" in an attempt to make cash off his customers to make up the missing money. Perhaps?
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:13:47
That's normally true, but only when you don't spend the fiat in customer accounts and/or only when the fiat isn't confiscated by the government.  In the GOX/Karpeles situation, he had large amounts of fiat confiscated by the government and there's reason to suspect he also may have been spending fiat from customer accounts to operate his business.

If a person's financial situation and surroundings pretty much force them to sell their ~~body~~ mind &amp; time  or starve, is it really "voluntary"? You can make the argument that it's a personal and voluntary decision all day long, but this is the reality a lot of ~~sex workers~~ wage workers face.
In capitalism, not everyone can make it, it literally requires a desperate underclass to sustain itself. I wouldn't call a lot of transactions that happen in the real world "voluntary".
Edit: before I get the usual people going "lolol just move or refuse the deal or seek out a better situation" try saying that without being comfortable and well fed behind your computer. The real world is fucked when you step out into it.
That being said... there's little difference between a wage slave at a corporation in a dead-end job and the "bad examples" of prostitution you are thinking of.  Both are dead end jobs where the underlings are exploited and kept down for the benefit of their patrons.  Prostitution is about sex tho, and sex is bad, right?
Anyway.. I have known lots of prostitutes in my time.  Been to many a brothel.  I have seen independent girls making a killing, seen girls working in brothels that were exploited.. seen brothels run by a true madame and the girls were happy to be there.  It's a big world out there and prostitution itself is not the problem.  If anything, for some girls it's a way to earn lots of money and win their independence, make friends in high places, feel empowered.  It's also fun for lots of girls.  You're making it out like all prostitutes are being beaten by their pimp every day and are miserable.  Some of them genuinely enjoy the lifestyle and the money and connections it can get them.  Really.  
It's no different than any other business.  You can find examples of people being exploited in the business world, and other people being liberated from their chains.  Depends on where you look and who you talk to.
BTW: Given a choice, I'd rather spend 20 minutes on my back for the same money I could earn in 4 hours of my time during the day in a job I hate. (I love my job BTW, but if I hated it, I'd rather be a prostitute!!).
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:32:23

Right.  And if you want to get your hands on some satoshis you have to basically buy them, which involves real-world hassle.  
Another solution woudl be to pre-load the satoshis onto the device's wallet.  But, this means that the manufacturer or whomever prepared the device generated the key for you.  That has security risks.. and also if the device is lost or wiped the pre-loaded satoshis are gone forever.
Making the device generate a new wallet when first run and then mine for itself seems like a very reasonable solution.  You get satoshis without any hassle, and you only get the satoshis you more-or-less need.  If they are lost it's just a few satoshis, and not the end of the world.

I live in Romania now.  I gotta say the internet here is ubiquitous and blazing fast and amazingly cheap for what you get.  I pay about $20 a month for what amounts to 100Mbit downstream.  It's faster than my 802.11g router can spit out on a regular wifi and I had to upgrade to a faster 5GHz wifi just to be able to download at full speed.
The thing is here, there are quite a few internet provider companies competing with each other.  You have local "de cartier" (of the neighborhood) providers that offer really fast service that's wired via RJ-45 (!!), plus the cable companies, of which there are 3, plus other companies providing service.  They are all competing with each other.  This brings price down.  Compare that to American cities where by and large nowadays you have 1 huge cable company for the whole city and its interest is in providing the least amount of service possible for the highest price, since it is basically a monopoly.
Wherever you go in Romania, there's free wifi.  I was at a hair salon for LITTLE KIDS (the kind with toys and fancy chairs to keep kids happy as they get their hair cut), and the free wifi there was blazing fast.  I'm talking downloading a 1GB file in a 2-3 mins kind of fast.  And that was a hair salon!  Not even a cafe!
Every crappy cafe or even corner store has a wifi.  There are no nazi laws here making the business owner liable for anything illegal done on the wifi (or if there are, they aren't enforced).  So that, and combined with the cheap internet means every business also ends up installing a wifi router when it opens up.  Often they package the whole deal along with a landline for the business owner, thus encouraging the ubiquity.  A store owner almost doesn't respect himself if he doesn't offer free wifi and is afraid he'll lose customers.  And seriously, the free wifi is really fast here.  
I went to Paris and noticed the wifi there sucks.  Most European cities have incredibly shitty wifi everywhere, and most people don't even expect to get free wifi at their cafes anymore. Partly this is because in Western Europe the nazi laws in place make the businesses fearful of repricussions if their wifi is used to download child porn, and also partly because the internet in general sucks balls and is expensive in countries like France as compared to Romania.
So yeah, the internet here is really really incredibly good and cheap.

I think this will be the killer app.  Direct software-to-software micro-transactions.  It just isn't possible with current systems.  Making tiny fractions of a penny off a small software or content service, mutiplied by tens of thousands = $MONEY for people offering the service.  This leads to a much more frictionless and interesting set of possibilities.

No, because one of those things is more useful and convenient than the thing they are replacing, by a longshot, from day 1, whereas the other still has usability problems.
Bitcoin has yet to prove more convenient than paper money for your average person.  You need a freakin' degree in computer science to actually use them and a degree in computer security to use them and not have them stolen from you.
Traditional banking and credit cards, which, with all their flaws, abuses, and inefficiencies at least provide you some semblance of peace of mind because if someone steals your card or makes charges on your account, the bank will reimburse you.
Bitcoin on the other hand has a real shot at replacing traditional money transfer systems like western union.  That's where it will shine at first since already it pretty much kicks the ass of any other money transmitting system. 
But for day-to-day buying a coffee, paying for a slice of pizza or taking a taxi?  Meh.. I'm skeptical.
Maybe some hybrid bitcoin/centralized system will be the first killer app.  Where people get the insurance and convenience of a central bank without being required to have a device as secure as a bank to not have their life savings stolen.

Warning: any price prediction should be taken with a grain of salt and then some.  Noone can tell you what the future holds as far as price goes.
My 2 cents is that it's the best time to buy that we've seen in quite a long time.  After the price hit its most stable low in a year (230s), and stayed there for months, it's finally beginning to climb back up in a very steady fashion -- and it looks to me like it'll hit a new floor that might be well into the 300s.  I've been watching bitcoin for 2 years now and this looks like a real new price we're going to arrive at in the coming months.
The halving is coming in 9 months. You definitely want to buy before then.  Chances are the price will increase quite a bit right before and after the halving.
