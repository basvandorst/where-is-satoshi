I’ve been through several events since 2013. Good and bad. This one coming is staring me in the face. I can’t help but try to warn people. My minuscule posts on reddit will have no affect on market price. Just trying to reach a couple people. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:42
Will be affected by market price. Not shutdown no. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:29:53
Yes it will. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:18:46
When bitfinex implodes and everyone realizes their scam. Prepare for it at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:21:58
I will buy it immediately. Gdax. Ready. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:49:50
my agenda is to save people from being defrauded. At this point ive said enough. I’ll stop posting. Hopefully someone is helped. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:17
Its sad. People think they are going to get rich. Totally blinded by greed. Most have no idea what is coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:24:00
You are ignoring the elephant in the room. Doing analysis on market data when there is blatant fraud make analysis results flawed. Dear god people at least prepare for the bitfinex implosion. When we realize just how much bitfinex was manipulating the price, people will be shocked.
Please don’t invest more than you can lose. I actually get sad when i see the excitement in this subreddit. People have no idea what is coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:26:08
Wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:16:09
No. All USD until bitfinex happens. I highly suggest the same for others. Unfortunately all crypto coins are going to suffer. It will be a black eye for a little while. I have no idea how far it may drop. It really sucks because people have put their entire savings into btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:02:20
Bitfinex is insolvent and it will implode soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:12:37
Ask theymos if he will escrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:25:09
I pmd him
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:32:04
Don’t do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:55
Wait until litecoin drops down to $5. Yes it will happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:18:30
People don’t realize how easy it is for the US government to seize a domain. Eventually bitfinex homepage will look like this: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:36:52
Read the report. Bitfinex showed the auditor printed bank statements on paper without allowing the auditor to confirm with the banks. Auditor didn’t even view the account online, just paper statements from bitfinex. 
Bitfinex can easily have two separate audits without standing in the way. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:03:22
You may be in for a big surprise. Btc can drop quickly. Today is just a hiccup. You have not seen a true btc crash live. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:27:54
Bitfinex volume is not real. Just like mtgox volume was fake. Karpeles admitted it. Wake up guys. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:20:56
The bet is to get people to read the statements. If anyone wants to take the bet, ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:22:01
Bitfinex will implode first unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:34:51
Your missing the point of the bet. The bet itself is to get people to read what im saying. Not trying to make money on .05 bitcoin. Im ok losing $90 in value if anyone take the bet and i win. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:23:28
Im willing to hold .1 btc until 2020 when its back above 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:47:38
Its all related market wise. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:27:21
Its very sad. Blinded by hoping their investment goes up. Ive been in bitcoin for a long time. This is nothing new. I have seen many exchanges bite the dust voluntarily or otherwise. At least people saw mtgox coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:24:21
Gdax. $90 buy. Outside wallet. Takes 5minutes
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:23:15
CME and others know bitfinex is a time bomb. They will short the price. Ask yourself a simple question: why wouldn’t CME use bitfinex (top 3 volume) in their BRR? 
I don’t want it to happen but i am realistic and can hopefully warn others. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:45:02
Only bitfinex or tether can prove anything. Have an open mind and realize that there is a big problem. Unfortunately people are going to get burned and it really sucks. I don’t need bitcoin to drop in price, my only agenda is to hopefully save someone from having their savings disappear for a few years until bitcoin bounces back. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:13:31
To you it’s fud. To me it’s reality. I suppose it’s what we truly believe ourselves. Time will tell. 
Do you think im saying all of this to maybe drop the price to buy btc? Im not buying btc until bitfinex has imploded. My motivation is simple: save at least one person from getting hurt. 
I believe no one should get involved right now if they are going to be in a jam if btc drops below 2k. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:42:01
Thanks. The bet is a celebrity boxing match. My agenda is to get people to at least read what im saying. Ill lose either way and am ok with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:28:13
We need a mod to agree to escrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:44:54
Yes it is very different. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:39:47
The market cap is based on current price. This doesn’t mean each bitcoin was purchased for $8500. People forget that its bitfinex wash trading and driving the price. They can easily make it 10k. They are margin calling using their loans. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:13:34
To wake people up. I can buy .01 right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:56:40
I’ve been around bitcoin for a long time. Bought at $75 which i can prove on bitcoin talk forum. Im pure fiat now. Please don’t fall for what’s currently happening. Its blatantly obvious what bitfinex is doing. Don’t be blinded by greed. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:36:00
We all want it to go to the moon. Just don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:33:08
When CME launches futures. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:01:50
It doesn’t take much to plunge price. Liquidity is almost nonexistent 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:06:01
Shortly after CME futures launch, many short positions will open. Bitfinex will reveal itself. Lots of people will make money. Bitcoin will rebound after a little while. Part of its growth is removing these shady exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:23:25
Highly suggest newcomers understand the market price and why its rising. Things are not what they seem. Do your research. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:44
Losing your money from market price drop or exchange closes? Different things. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:30:36
Hate to hear that. People believe what they want to believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:52:58
Its best to do your own research and not take someones word. Im just the messenger. Best of luck guys. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:34:13
No one knows. Most likely when US govt seizes tether and bitfinex domains. Or when bitfinex admits it. Implosion cause and date is anyone’s guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:47
The order book is so thin. Doesn’t take much btc to swing the price either up or down. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:20:02
When btc drops below $800 then litecoin will be under $5. If you think btc won’t drop that low then you haven’t been around that long. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:47:14
Google ‘bitfinex tether’. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:44
Involvement with tether. Tether is going to cause numerous financial crimes investigations. Any exchanges involved in it will be trouble. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:25:43
Then i lose. Its price on 1/1/2018 12am GMT
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:07:27
Im not interested in spreading ‘fud’. I don’t have some agenda. If at least one person doesn’t lose their savings because of me I feel I did a good deed. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:04:38
If an exchange accepts tether or trades tether it will be shut down. Get off an exchange that has involvement with tether in any way. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:24:51
4k is the high end. Itll drop below 2k. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:34:11
Hopefully he is wrong, unfortunately i think he’s spot on. Bitfinex has done a real disservice to the crypto world not just bitcoin. They have probably been manipulating their exchange for quite some time. Margin lending, wash trading. People who lost bitcoin on bitfinex by margin trading probably lost it to the exchange and not another trader. Sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:01:41
Google ‘tether bitfinex’ and have an open mind. I honestly wish it wasn’t true. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:51:27
No salt mine. Just reality. Good luck. Im out. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:17:04
Im optimistic long term (5yrs). I don’t want people losing their savings short term. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:41:17
You were warned. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:51
Do your research on Bitfinex and Tether. It is going to go down as one of the biggest frauds ever. Its not FUD, its real. I don’t care about market price right now. Its all bs. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:26:06
Very sad people don’t realize this. Lots of people are going to get burned. Sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:34:11
We need a mod to escrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:56:56
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:55
I recommend putting a limit order at $300 per btc on an exchange. It could possibly fill given a flash crash. Its happened before. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:30:17
Its a rigged game by bitfinex. They obviously control the exchange and can set the market price to whatever they want by wash trading up or down. Its a clever scam but won’t last much longer. I’d be willing to bet that the feds are already making their approach. You can’t mess with usd and expect the US to let it slide. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:52:32
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:32
I am not sure. I don’t follow iota. If it’s bitfinex dependent then steer clear 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:45:28
Bitfinex gets a tether for $150m. Immediately its all available for loan on margin. Unfortunately traders borrow using their bitcoin. Bitfinex calculates the positions, trades against the loans either up or down. People get called and lose btc. They sell btc to cover other margin side. Profit by using fake money loans. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:32:08
I really hope people realize something big is going to happen to the price. Massive CME short positions will surprise people. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:48:30
I stand corrected. Will edit. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:26:15
I assure you im not upset I don’t hold btc atm. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:33:59
Not keeping anything secret. Wish more people realized it. 
Their exchange volume has been manipulated by them issuing tethers to themselves, wash trading and trading tethers as well. 
Ordinary traders cant deposit to tether, so where is the 500+ million usd coming from? Not a single confirmation of x institution or company depositing to tether. 
Why would any large institution send tether millions of dollars knowing its in the grey area regulation wise, especially after seeing what happened to btce? Why would an institution not use gdax or bitstamp? 
Please guys wake up. I want btc to be 100k as well but im not blind. Im a huge bitcoin supporter thats just doing what I think is right.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:17:36
No problem. Ask theymos to escrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:19:28
Google ‘bitfinex tether’. They are printing money and driving the price up. Creating a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:12:26
Ask theymos if he will escrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:06
This is one of the most uninformed comments I’ve ever read on reddit. If you were around in 2013 you would have read the same ‘mainstream adoption’ and the effects of exchange closures. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:16:08
Bitfinex is wash trading on their exchange. They are driving the price up. They are also causing margin calls up and down to collect bitcoin from margin traders. Selling it back for cash. Their entire tether scheme is blatant fraud. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:44
I am not shorting anything. No one should go near bitfinex either.
