The bitcoin price follow the number of transaction , but the transaction get less when the price get higher 
So it's following a cycle of rise followed by  calm down and logically is going to converge to a stability but no sure the price, but it will be awesome to see it stable

thanks for the share, but what is the best way to keep updated about the technical improvement of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:32:25
It's a good topic, indeed
First: the target of libra is the 2 billions Facebook users that trust Facebook even if it's a fucked up company with shady stuff
Second: even bitcoin is the most secure and easy to use currency , still didn't get the trust of the public opinion 
third: Facebook has enough power on weak countries to make it the main currency and it's totally okay for a fast early adoption 
Conclusion 
Libra probably will not succeed because being a global currency is not something big banks will let it happen; but it's shows that bitcoin was and is the way to go
