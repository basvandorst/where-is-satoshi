- logins still do not work. I don't have any adblockers or anything that would prevent any type of content from loading. I have tried on multiple browsers on multiple computers located on multiple networks. Same result. 502 and 504 errors which is a back end network misconfiguration on your end. Strangely, the new account I created to test with has no issues logging in. Only my account that has USD balances is being blocked from logging in. Your data center people should be the ones looking into this since it's likely network/configuration related.

They got this fixed and I was able to login. Hope you guys also were able to get logged in.

yeah no prob, we're all in this together. I've listened to phil's interview on whalepool where someone else brought up this same issue. While I have faith in BFX getting us back online, it's definitely stressin the nerves a bit today not being able to get in. Hoping for the best. I've got support tickets in and have chatted with them about the issue, so hopefully good news for us soon! I'll update this thread if I hear anything or if logins start working.

Same situation. I emailed their support, contact them on facebook, and posted on reddit an hour before they went online letting them know about this problem. It's been 5+ hours now and I still can't login to my bitfinex account. Strangely, I was able to create a NEW account a login just fine with my new account. As soon as I tried to login with my actual account (where I have USD balances) I get 502 and 504 errors in the browser console. I have tried logging in from different machines, different browsers, and from different networks across the US. No luck. They have blocked me out of my account. Here are my details:

- I can not login to bitfinex.com. I get 504 errors in the console. I have tried multiple browsers and computers. I have already emailed support but this should be resolved before going live. I was able to create a new account and login with that account without issue. When I login with my existing account (the one that has my USD and BFX) I get 504 errors when logging in. Please notify your dev team asap and you should probably hold off on launching until all users can access the site reliably.

Bitfinex has resolved this issue and I was able to get logged in this afternoon USA time. I saw others who were having the issue were also able to get logged in. Hopefully resolved for all users now.

I can't login for over 5 hours now. I let bitfinex know an hour before they enabled trading. I created a new account and that account logs in just fine. My account with USD balances can NOT login - 502 and 504 errors in the browser console.

Same. Created new account - that account can login. My real account (where i have USD balances) can't login. I was logged in yesterday just fine. Today, haven't been able to login to the site for over 5 hours now.
