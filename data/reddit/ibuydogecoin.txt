Never herd of caribou coffee and spend a bit is like coffee you have to make I'm talking coffee shops so my walk to work I can use bitcoins instead of visa

@_date: 2014-09-05 00:35:51

@_date: 2014-08-31 02:23:58
See I'm from Canada , never come across a bitcoin bar but I was more less thinking of a way to order online and pay with bits for delivery

@_date: 2014-08-28 03:28:39
What you think will happen in 5 years ?
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:34:04
I'm not sure what your referring to ... Yes I collect doge and litecoin , I'm asking if it's still worth jumping into bitcoins how does my username stand for this decision ?
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:09:46
Lol that's would be a nice eventful night 
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:35:07
My mornings are chaos lol so on my way to work there is a Tim's I usually go there 
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:00:02
Yes but I rather get a couple full coins instead of part coin , buying .1 like 20 times just make one purchase
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:51:11
True ok I think I'm going to save up and invest , why did it jump form 3$ -500 isn't that rapid growth
@_date: 2014-08-31 11:17:02
Oh ok
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:02:32
As in 600 + to buy a full coin 
@_date: 2014-08-31 02:24:53
Thats a bit far from where Iam
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:35:18
Holy that's crazy ... 
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:05:15
I'm not cheap just didn't see the point I figured the price would of droped lower then 500 by not and I wasn't going to spend hundreds of dollars just for the cost of a coin to half and I lose a bunch of money but the economy seems steady
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:02:48
I guess I could buy part of a coin
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:36:17
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:29:16
