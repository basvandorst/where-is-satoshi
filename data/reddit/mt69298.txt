Well with free electricity I guess you can go mad and only care about getting a return on your hardware investment

I think a problem is that I have no real idea how much power my computer is drawing. I've got a single GPU (6850, 215MHash/s), and nothing else than 2 SSDs to drive. PSU at 600W but I realise I'm nowhere near that. Electricity cost is $0.12. According to [this]( my break even is at 402W. Any idea how I can figure out how much power I'm using?

People regularly split checks on several credit cards in Sweden. Granted, people tend to limit the number of cards by sorting out what is owed among friends later.

Indeed. But the library/framework would have to also support the case where no wallet app is installed.
For example displaying a barcode for scanning with another device, cllicking could fire an intent to open a wallet app, and another button could lead to a site powered by bitpay or similar where users without bitcoins could pay with their cards (that part would have to be delivered by the app author though).

On Android it is always possible to install applications directly and completely bypass the Play store. In that case there is no way for Google to interfere with the app and would be a way for developers who are not able to offer their apps in the play store to offer in-app purchasing.
I am unable to find clear answers on what Google's terms are (but we can assume them to be negative). And we all know what Apple will say...
