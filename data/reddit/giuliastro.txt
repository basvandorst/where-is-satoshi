I recreated a private key using those words and now I own all Rick's cryptos. Mainly NEV, GON, GIV and UP.

I believe we should see this in the opposite way: Rimini Calcio invested in Quantocoin, which is currently in the ICO stage, giving 25% of its shares. I believe this post shouldn't be in the Bitcoin subreddit but these news are so nice and interesting, thank you.

It's like someone paying you $100/y (actually not even dollars or bitcoins but a very volatile crypto) for both not using Chrome and receiving ads as pop-ups. Chrome has it's free ad blockers too.
These are mainly the reasons why I stopped using Brave and why I don't think it's worth it at all yet. And when gains will start raising they will just come out with a similar solution using Bitcoin + LN. There is no reason to use BAT anymore when there is Bitcoin and LN.

What the hell has the NY Attorney General to do with Bitfinex? Bitfinex doesn't have anything to do with USA they even banned and blocked every US user long time ago to avoid this stupid politic financial war the USA usually fights with anybody that is not USA. I wonder what that little US entity can do.

Why sell at $6000+ when you could sell at $9000+

I totally agree unless he decides to sell his t-shirts for fiat, one day. That way he'd be banned by holders.

I don't even know what is going on here but hey
