Did you ever get a resolution?  I'm having the exact same problem.  Generated a private key on bitaddress.org quite a while ago.  It's 51 characters, begins with '5K'.  Trying to sweep the key now and both blockchain.info and bitaddress.org are telling me it's invalid.  I'm nearly certain that I'm entering it exactly as was presented to me on bitaddress.org a number of months ago.
The key does contain a capital letter 'O' which I understand now is not a valid character in base58.  Is it possible that bitaddress.org generated some slightly invalid keys in the past?

Solved my problem.  Due to a formatting issue on bitaddress.org, capital Q's look a lot like capital O's.

Your average for the combined transactions is still only around 160 sat/B. (80+80+80+80+480)/5 . As of now, you need to get the average up around 500 if you want them confirmed in the next block. I used this strategy yesterday and it worked well.  Good luck!

No.  Almost every news article about Bitcoin includes a statement about the hard cap of 21 million.  Since that's well less than the world population, it's easy to appreciate one of Bitcoin's most important properties: its scarcity.  Don't change that!

Regarding that first graph under point 9, EUR/USD isn't a stock.

Redondo at Anaheim.  I’m just a few blocks from there too. Also interested in info on local meetups.

I believe we all see different Yahoo content based on our demographic profiles, past search histories, etc.  If you're seeing a lot of Bitcoin-related stories, it's probably because you've shown interest in the past.

This reminds me of a brief period during the mid-90's when you could go to Barnes &amp; Noble and buy a copy of the "internet yellow pages" which claimed to include a description of every website on the internet.  Keeping that sucker up to date was obviously a lesson in futility for some poor soul.
Just a few months later the first-generation search engines were born.  They were still manually curated but it was a big improvement over a printed book.  But the technology that ultimately “solved search” (and made Google one of the biggest companies in the world) is the web crawler.
So where is our blockchain crawler?  Trying to figure out who accepts bitcoin by looking on some manually-updated website seems about as antiquated as looking in a book to find a business's website.

OP, which browser did you use to generate the keys?

I had some BTC at Tradehill when they closed up shop in early 2012 and ended up getting them all back.  Granted, there are some big differences between Tradehill and MtGox but I wouldn't say it's a foregone conclusion that all Gox deposits are history at this point.

It's obviously a Facebook vanity address.  Zuck is about to end run Winklevii again.

Those of you choosing to encrypt your keys, are you sharing the passphrase with someone else?  Personally, I feel my risk of sudden death or brain injury is just as high, if not higher, than the risk of my unencrypted paper wallet being compromised.

Wow, this guy knows his stuff. Thanks for sharing this.

Probably CampBX. I think they were in Atlanta. For a brief period they were one of the most reputable exchanges.  Initially, they accepted ACH transfers but then that fell apart and sending money orders became the only way to fund an account.

I'm an american citizen living in the U.S.  Can I use this service to sell bitcoin for euros during my vacation in Paris next month?

So it was an international wire transfer?  You forgot to tell us about the very generous exchange rate that the bank selected for you.

CheapAir is great.  I've used them many times, including quite recently.
I've never had any luck with BTCTrip.  Their website never seems to be working correctly.

Expedia has never accepted BTC for plane tickets.  They do accept BTC for many hotels.
@_date: 2016-07-22 05:37:34
Expedia does not and never has accepted BTC for flights. Hotels only.

You guys know about this one, right? 
It's not mine, but I think it's currently based at SMO too.

I can't find the rental rates on the website.  Are they posted somewhere?

Worked fine for me about a month ago.  Took $40 USD over to Wells Fargo and had BTC in about three hours.
