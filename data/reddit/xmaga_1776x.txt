Or tax cuts —&gt; more money in hands of consumers and businesses —&gt; more economic growth —&gt; more tax revenue because of said growth. 
While tax cuts tend to increase the deficit in the short term, they more than make up for it in the long run because of the resulting economic growth.  
I would have thought a sub centered around a decentralized currency would be familiar with the Austrian school of economics.

That’s not an inherently bad thing unless you view energy consumption, as a whole, wrong.  As population grows and society further develops, we’re going to consume more energy.  So acting as an increase in energy consumption is inherently negative is illogical.

Yes, because increasing people’s economic freedoms is so unethical.  Everybody knows it’s only ethical if currency is controlled by a massive government agency like the federa reserve. /s

Not all of them believe that it’s man-made though.  I’ve heard plenty of them argue that it’s not man-made.  Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, has a PHD in ecology is a good example for you.

Never said it had no affect.  I said it had a marginal affect.  The role the Green House Gas effect has in climate change has also been over emphasized.  Though CO2 emissions have been rising, the rate at which the tempature is rising is much smaller what the models have predicted.
The fact that you refer to him as working for a “conservative propaganda website” perfectly exemplifies the fact that this is a political issue to you, not a scientific one.  If it wasn’t political you wouldn’t be discrediting other people’s point of view as propaganda.

 They’ll definitely try to regulate it.  To what extent depends on who’s in power.

Jesus, you speak like some a bad parody of some Maoist dictator.  Who are you to decide what the “enemy of logic and reason” is?  The whole point of logical and reason is determine truth, not to be used as an arm of your political movement.


Sure, at the moment it has an accessible problem when dealing with places without internet access, but it crypto-currency was able to reach these areas it would be a heck off a lot better than what they currently have because it won’t be backed up by only the word of unstable governments. Take for example Venezuela. Their inflation rate has soared pased 4000% because their government tried to print its way out of a hole.  Now, the citizens that would have put just a small amount of their money into bitcoin would at least be able to put food on their plate.

Climates change.  The environment isn’t static, so a increase in temperature shouldn’t be something we sink billions of dollars into.  We went through a mini-ice age during the Middle Ages.  Obviously this had negative affects, but climate change is now where near the world ending disaster that it’s made out to be.

What if I were to tell you that our current  monetary system (fiat) was based on nothing but the word of the government and debt.  


Let me tell you a story that Milton Friedman uses to explain currency. It’s a true story by the way.  There is a pacific island by the name of Yap.  Yap didn’t have many natural resources, nothing that could be bartered for.  So the people of Yap started carving stones to serve as currency.  Many of these stones were to large to transport.  So eventually it stoped being required that they had to be transferred to one person to another.  They records of them were to be Kept orally.  The point being that it may seem foreign that Yap used stone as a currency, but it isn’t that far of from how our “civilized” currency operates.  The market gave value to the stones.  They were given as credit for work. This ultimately became a better option then bartering.  So how is bitcoin any different?  It seems worthless and foreign to many, but ultimately it’s more efficient and valuable than fiat currency.

If they can get Western Europe to buy into it, they can get the EU to regulate it.  Then you’ll have the social democrat types here in the US wanting to regulate it.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:00:47
Most Republicans don’t.  The more progressive democrats do.  Even if they don’t, it’s a good excuse for more regulations.

Ok, thanks.  That’s what I’d planned on doing,  transferring to either a paper wallet or dedicated hardrive. I’ve only got small amounts on Coinbase at the moment, but now I’m in a better financial place position to invest.

You’re right.  Ecology science, based off the scientific method. Climate change is based off a political ideology.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:50:10
I’m sure there is some truth in it.  But a large section of it is politically motivated. They take a supposition, climate change is man-made, and try to prove it, instead of following the scientific method.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:14:56
So let me ask you about this “simple bartering system.”  
I run out of fuel on the road and need to fuel up, how so I barter for that?
The electricity bill is due, how am I to barter for that?
I run a service business, how am I to pay my employees if I don’t make a product, but provide a service?
Your “simple barter system” doesn’t work outside the third world, that’s why it is always replaced once a civilization reaches a certain level of complexity.  It just isn’t practical.   
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:55
Maybe that attitude is why you fail to understand bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:37:22
This type of “doom and gloom” rhetoric has been around since the 1970s when Paul Ehrlicht said that the Brittish Isles would be mostly underwater by the 1990s.  The true is climate change models have been over estimating the rate at which he climate is changing for years now.  Climate change scare mongering has been used as an easy way to to get federal funding for reach projects for years now.
As for the glaciers, they have a marginal effect on the sea level.  NASA also published a report in 2015 reporting that the Antarctic sheet ice was growing.  
As for the hurricanes, our record only date as far back to the late 1800s.  Before then, hurricane were only recorded as “large storms.”  We dont’t have much hard data on them before the 1800s.  So we can’t known if hurricane activity has increased relative to other centuries before the industrial revolution.  Actually, climate related deaths have decreased dramatically since they 1930s.  1932 has a reported 5,073,283 climate related deaths,  where as in 2013, there is a reported 29,404 climate related deaths.  That’s a 99.4 percent drop since 1932.

I’ve seen it marketed in a more libertarian way. The whole idea being bitcoin is a decentralized and lightly regulated currency. Sure, I’ve seen some market it as socialist by saying it will “take down the 1%” but that seems to be the minority.
Why is that mentality entitlement?  It seem more entrepreneurial.  It’s about getting wealthy through good investments.  Nobody is saying they deserve it.  They’re aspiring for it.

It’s not that simple though.  The more bitcoin that’s mined, the harder it gets to mine.  So I’d think they’re be a point where using GPUs to mine would be ineffectual.
