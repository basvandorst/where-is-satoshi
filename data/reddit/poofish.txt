I'm replying here because this will likely be buried elsewhere, but this entire thread is based on the worst interpretation of US sanctions I've ever seen.
This type of Executive Order is worded in the same way dozens of other country-based sanctions programs under OFAC are drafted. For example, please see one of the EOs issued in reaction to the situation in Ukraine: 
The wording of section 1 is almost entirely the same. At first glance, it sounds like everyone remotely connected to the described situation is sanctioned, but that's not how sanctions work. Until a person is actually designated by the government under s.1(a)(i), this order doesn't affect ANYONE.
OFAC periodically updates a list of Specially Designated Nationals ("SDNs"), which is a global list of sanctioned individuals and entities. Until Snowden's, or any other alleged cyberterrorist's name shows up on there, the sanctions aren't affecting ANYONE.
So you guy can donate your entire life savings to Snowden at the moment and the government won't give two shits. People need to stop pretending to be lawyers and give dramatic interpretations of legalese without any experience in a particular area of law.

Yes, it could apply to any person, bu they have to first be designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the AG and the Secretary of State. It may sound like they have unfettered power, but in reality they don't just start throwing everyone's names on it for no reason. These designations are released on OFAC's Recent Actions page:  
And by being designated, they become an SDN by definition. Currently, *no one* has been designated by virtue of this EO, so it doesn't apply to anyone yet.
