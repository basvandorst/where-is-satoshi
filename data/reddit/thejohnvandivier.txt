Allow me. Classic economic definition of money:

I'm a big proponent of the "KISS Principle." Id est seems superfluous.
Id Est could be used to describe any currency. Even fiat could be described as id est.
Furthermore, if Id Est is being used to denote currency which is not fiat currency, it should be referred to in the same way similar monies have been called in the past. Prior to fiat, money which was not fiat was simply called money.
Perhaps commodity money to be more specific to money which was not government issued.

The information has to be available to the market for prices to adjust, not just a small group of insiders. Insider trading can't create market prices due to a lack of liquidity.
Btw. News DOES affect prices all the time. Check out the NYSE and USD price just after 9/11/01 for example. The terrorists new it was going down, so by your logic they should have priced this in. It made an impact because regardless of what a few people knew, the market at large was surprised.

A commodity money is a good which can both function as a money and also maintains other properties useful in their own right. For example, cigarettes or pure gold.
Bitcoin is both a system and the units of account within that system.
The units of account called bitcoins are commodity money.

Candidates DO pay for votes even when they are not certain they will get them.
It's called advertising. It's an inefficient and risky (from the candidate and the voter's point of view) system which creates a negative externality of nuissance to non-interested parties.

Eliminate secret ballots for voters. Allow vote selling. This allows the laws of economics to act to create an efficient voting outcome.

The whole concept of dynamic equilibrium.

I do have something to add.
The specific functionality of external state Contracts (  )
could be used for the birth of a Bitcoin minarchy. A political state. Now I know most of us here are anarchists, but a Bitcoin minarchy would nontheless be worth talking about.
Full accounting of every government action ever taken. Foolproof voting. Streamlined redistribution. Quick and financially sustainable military mustering. Finally, a BTC minarchy would be fully participation-optional, gathering funds more like Kickstarter than anything else.
Remember, redistribution is highly inefficient, but nonetheless it is sometimes morally desirable. BTC could allow this to be done in a streamlined, fast, corruption-proof manner with full and accurate accounting.
Finally there is the classic minarchy-anarchy question of force: No one desires force until they are victimized. Should there be a force-reserve on call for BTC which can be mustered and properly funded in a short time frame to protect the BTC community from physical assault against the world military? People who thought not would simply not enter into a BTC-automated socio-political contract. People who did desire such a thing would simply sign on via sending a certain amount of coin to a particular designated destination.
Finally, crowdfunding/crowdlending/crowdinvesting etc can all be implemented direct through the BTC contract protocol without the need for firms such as Kickstarter/Wefunder/Lendingclub. BTC-based crowdaction would be faster, less costly, and less dependent on monolithic structural integrity.

I like the idea of cross-referencing the population/user size with the market cap. I'm surprised I didn't think of such an analysis since I looked up data for both anyway.
However I wonder if your label of the lower number as 'reasonable' is a bit arbitrary. If the real space was 500k that would imply an average investment of about $600, with a median much lower as well. Is that unreasonable?
The answer for me is I have no idea! I will research normal economic growth patterns of normal countries (GDP/Pop growth rate norms) and write another article on the blog. Upvoted. Thanks for this idea!

Krugman: 
@_date: 2013-02-22 02:53:15
Fundamentals are determined by economic laws ie a currency is devalued when more is printed by the Quantity theory of Money. Economic law describes basically all rational price movements.
However price movements often behave irrationally because they are determined by people and people are irrational. If people are afraid the USD will collapse, even though the economy it is based on is sound, the USD will drop because people irrationally panic and sell it. Similarly overconfidence can contribute to an upward "mania," the opposite of a "panic."
People often have preferences which defy economic logic at face value, such as preferring to own a pet which makes them happy despite the huge economic loss it causes. "Pretty numbers" notoriously influence investors despite the fact that they hold no fundamental properties, eg crude breaking the $100 barrier in the US. Finally, hitting new all-time highs is often a big psychological resistance marker. Even if the economy is much more powerful than previously it may encounter pure preference or psychological resistance and I believe that is what's happening here.
Once the barrier is sufficiently broken, the idea goes, a breakout will occur when people realize their fears or optimism was ill-founded.
Hope that helped,

Arbitrage is bad for the whole economy. It indicates the presence of bad price signals in an economy. These price discrepancies lead to excessive cost in production which discourages production and, in the cases where production moves ahead, results in an increased cost to the consumer.
On the other hand it can be "good" to private investors who want to take advantage of the discrepancies to earn money for themselves.
Wild fluctuations can be decreased by increasing the liquidity in a market and reducing transaction costs of currency exchange.

Work on bitcoin contracts. Mike Hearn is a leading expert on the topic right now 
These things could be developed into a complete political economy, allowing full evasion of the government through contract-directed voting, taxing, redistribution or lack thereof.
Another thing we need to work on is getting a full-circuit BTC economy. This means we need people to be able to be employed and earn in BTC. Currently we have to get paid in local currency, convert, then spend. This is an inefficient process and exposes people to risk of government action.

Faster processing is a wash with one exception, 1-conf transactions are advantageous for POS transactions.
Lower barrier to entry means that the network will be deconcentrated relative to BTC which offers an advantage to BTC Guild possibly going rogue.
Spending btc to litecoin is a perfect wash. You have no idea what you are talking about.

People will want to save but not an unlimited amount. They will not forego basic necessities nor opportunities which outpace the negative interest rate.

Wow! An excellent post! That post has so many things I was thinking in it...You offer four possibilities ABC or D yet you do not voice your own opinion. Clearly A and C are the more likely options in my view. I would vote C, a surge, because of the market fundamentals, but there will certainly be some correction. It is the magnitude of this correction which I am uncertain of.
What would you suppose? Do you have an estimated correction magnitude?

I took a class by Salerno there and yes they are clueless about it. Salerno is a smart guy but he literally didn't understand that his own research implied that bitcoin is valid.

The intrinsic value argument holds and advantages bitcoin. I have explained this one million times but I will once again.
If btc has one better quality than gold, ceteris paribus, it is more intrinsically valuable. In reality is has several making it much more intrinsically valuable. Such qualities include:
More divisible, less costly to transport, harder to fake, less inflationary, harder to steal, harder to tax and containing added functionality such as automatic record keeping and so on.
I would just like to add that the intrinsic value theory holds. If you are dying of thirst you will pay more for water than if you are not dying of thirst. This is a subjective preference but it is more than that it is also an objective preference because water objectively satisfies your thirst. The mistakes people make are: 1) To hear "objective value" and think "Ayn Rand's objectivist school which is not the only kind, or even the correct understanding of, objective value. or 2) To hear "objective value" and think it somehow precludes, excludes or opposes subjective value. No it does not. Both exist and are valid for certain purposes in economics.

We also call bitcoin fractions by the metric scale sometimes. What would a satoshi be? With 8 decimal places that would make 1 satoshi = 10 nanocoins or nanos i believe

Schiff is a genius and already knows bitcoins potential but he's playing dumb because, as you mention, most of his money is riding on metals.

Spread of information is never totally disconnected from price, but I get your point.
I would say connected in a different way. This time the spread of information will drive price up instead of vice versa. There is always a connection between price and information.
The more information on crypto spreads the more successful we will be. Regardless of media spin, there is just too much good in our ideas for the popular audience to fully disregard. Demand will be driven up by some amount. The question is the degree.

Fundamentals DO support the rapid rise. New firms have begun accepting bitcoin - namely MEGA, Hosting.co.uk and Reddit. More firms mean more ability and motive to consume using bitcoin which increases the demand for bitcoins. Since supply is hard-limitted due to bitcoin's "difficulty" programming demand outpaces supply causing a rise in price to compensate.
