Or he could just keep it 50:50 as a hedge.

Did anyone read the May 15th update to the Dave Kleiman lawsuit? Because although the community doesn't want to hear it, there is absolutely evidence that Wright is Satoshi.

Unlike Roger and Jihan, most miners are not political. They will go to the chain that is most profitable.
The BCH side has done a very good job of culling politically motivated miners. The BTC side has alienated miners regardless.

BCH/BTC pair would make it possible if they played their cards right.

Roger Ver and Jihan Wu literally own enough BTC to tank the market indefinitely. To say BCH is not a threat is massively uninformed.

Not a fan of this guy.

He signed keys in front of Gavin and other Bitcoin developers-- who staked their reputation on Craig's merit and proof.

I wish I was Roger Ver. He is the most principled and tireless man in crypto.

Like it or not, Roger got that nickname for a reason. Newbies don't know, but he was one of the biggest Bitcoin evangelists early on and has basically made it his life mission to spread the word.

1000 peso coins.

Hah! Never got into ETH?

Not as much energy wasted as gold mining or Visa transactions.

Wow, I literally just saw the same post on /biz/. You are determined.

The alt coins of 2013 are not the alt coins of 2018. You may be surprised.
