What about forks?  By holding bitcoin you received bitcoincash.  Is that not a taxable event?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:50:56
Yeah, i don't disagree with that. My retired mother should store her cash in traditional banks and Vanguard (or whatever) funds, and not bitcoin. But the point is that, for the first time, there exists a platform for you to be your own bank. It's groundbreaking stuff. In light of this, you have to consider the manifest fees of bitcoin against not just the manifest fees of banks but also the latent fees of banks that do not exist on bitcoin and other virtual currency platforms.

@_date: 2018-01-07 18:01:31
It's a point I can't help but repeat: it only looks like you're not paying fees because they profit so much from holding your money. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there, and it's not fair to penalize bitcoin for making its fees manifest. To properly compare the two you can't just compare the manifest fees, you have to consider the latent fees as well.

If you acknowledge that they're comping you services, then you acknowledge that those services cost money. In exchange for getting comped those services, you are obviously providing something very valuable to the bank.  Bitcoin offers the potential to access that valuable thing.

Right, I had the same thought! That, and the supply of new coin from mining is relatively speaking a drop in the bucket compared to outstanding supply. We're adding 33% to the total over 100 years! 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:45:09
I mean, technically yes, but functionally this is the service they provide. You deposit $1,000. 10 years from now you can be fairly confident that you will be able to withdraw that amount plus some nominal interest. I think the big epiphany for people is that in those 10 years the bank made a 100% or greater profit from your money through their lending and other products and that growth could have been yours. So from that perspective, it's a shitty store of value because in those ten years the purchasing power of your $1,000 has dropped to $700 or whatever and you have nothing to show for it. But that's a different point.

@_date: 2018-01-08 03:19:34
Why are we comparing bitcoin to ETF investments? Shouldn't we be comparing them to bank deposits? The 3-4% was more a reference to growth resulting from (1) increase in quantity of fiat, and (2) deployments of bitcoin in traditional banking capacities but in a decentralized manner where you retain the profits. There will always be hackings and what not. Someone can mug you and take the cash out of your wallet. Just like bitcoin, that cash is now gone forever. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:44:34

@_date: 2018-01-07 20:43:11
The easiest thing I see is true decentralized lending. Disaggregate capital and underwriting. You choose the underwriter, and you provide the capital. You don't fund the full loan, just portions of it across thousands of accounts. If your underwriter did a good job you get a sweet return. If your underwriter sucks, you hire a new one next time. Combine this with Blockchain identity solutions. You want more risk, pick a portfolio of riskier borrowers. You want less, offer secured loans, like mortgages. But you are literally the bank. The companies that will replace the banks will sell bank like services without any need for capital. No more credit crisis situations because there's no bailout for bad underwriting. The market self regulates. For borrowers, this means access to cheaper credit. For you, this means better returns on your holdings. For liquidity, make the participations tradeable. You can then put cash in, and take it out, at will, all while earning a nice return.

Isn't this technically a shark post? A shit trend would look totally different. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:26:07
Why don't you care that the bank is making money off your money? Wouldn't you rather receive that interest directly? How far removed are we from a virtual currency platform that let's you do exactly that - fund loans directly with your bitcoin (i.e., just like peer to peer lending platforms)? This isn't some far off fantastical concept, it's an extension of more or less what peer to peer lenders do now but within the confines of the traditional monetary and banking system.
EDIT: just to add to this, the point I'm making is that just because you don't see a fee doesn't mean there isn't one. You don't see fees when you make CC purchases but you're still paying them. The fees are charged to the retailer and passed on to you. Same with banking services. Those are available to you as an incentive to deposit your money because banks make money off your money. This isn't some weird libertarian conspiracy theory, this is basic economics. There is no free lunch. Banks aren't there to provide a social service. They're there because they make money, specifically from your deposits.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:09:14
Yes, for sure. But you will (a) get more services for your money or cheaper services, and (b) have more choice over which services you purchase and use.

A lot of people are wondering how the market for bitcoin will respond in a crisis. This morning, for about 10 minutes, Hawaii thought it was about to be hit with nuclear missiles. Fortunately, the emergency alert was sent in error. But during those ten minutes, people had access to their cell phones. In addition, people around the world probably received word of this alert as well. Was there any increase in trading activity during those ten minutes? If so, did the price go up or down? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:27:51

People were actively trading during 9/11.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:40:39
Here's the thing though: the reason your bank doesn't charge a checking fee is because they already made money from you. They took the money you deposited and they lent it out at 3.5-4.5% interest. Meanwhile, they are paying you less than 1.0% interest for your money. They keep the difference. They do charge overdraft fees and other fees, which most responsible people rarely encounter, but it's not really about that. It's about the deposits they need in order to be able to lend. Now we're still feeling our way around bitcoin and it would be unreasonable to expect it to rise in value relative to usd 1700% each year, but is it unreasonable that it rises in value 3.5-4.5% each year, and more in years of inflation? And if so, which platform charges the higher fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:37:07
OK, we cool. What's the difference to your mind? I can assure you on the morning of 9/11 no one had any idea wtf was going on. I know because I was there. For all we knew, a dirty bomb or straight up nuclear bomb in a suitcase was next. Anything was possible and we were all scared shitless. Even so, traders kept trading right until the markets shutdown. Capitalism is a hell of a drug.

It's kind of like blowing 100k at a casino and being impressed that they comped you a 1k room. At this point, we're just yelling across the paradigm shift. I hate the expression, but we have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:27:04
No, the analogy has nothing to do with gambling v. depositing. I'm not some weird libertarian conspiracy theorists who would draw that connection. The analogy has to do with the incentive structure in place. You get comped a room because the casino wants your continued business. You get zero fee checking for the same reason. It's frankly obtuse to fail to see this (and by all indications, it seems that you do see it and acknowledge it and are not obtuse). And once you acknowledge this, you have to ask, why do they want my business and what is it that they're doing that I can't? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:07:42
It will also incentive miners in the next lowest cost electricity jurisdictions to start mining.

Well, I appreciate the opportunity to sharpen my understanding of these arguments. No better way than trying them on someone who doesn't agree. I keep ending by saying I'll stop now but here's one more thing. And this response is like the others. I'm gonna stop now but here's one more thing: you're confusing the platform with the services. You're right that bitcoin doesn't offer those things, but it's just a platform. It's up to entrepreneurial service providers to offer those things and I posit that they can do so at a lower cost (to you) than your bank. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:21:44
1) like I said, people were actively trading during 9/11.  Call it greed, call it a coping mechanism, call it whatever you want. But it's a fact.
2) The alert was only issued in Hawaii. I know it sounds cold and insensitive, but while some people may care deeply about Hawaii, their loved ones, etc., markets tend to be sociopathic. 
I'm not suggesting that we use nuclear alerts as a trading strategy or even that it's OK to do so (I agree it's messed up). I'm just asking if anyone knows whether the markets reacted to this news and, if so, how. I can guarantee you, for example, if this occurred during the trading day, stocks would have dropped sharply immediately only to recover once it was announced to be a false alert. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:34:04
It does compete with banks, as does gold. You can  store your money at a bank or you can buy bitcoin or gold. It competes directly with one of the principal services a bank provides: safekeeping of the value you have accumulated.

I feel like we're just on opposite sides of a wall that figuratively represents a paradigm shift. I don't mean to be dismissive of your view - nothing you're saying is wrong - but I feel like we're just viewing the world from very different perspectives and there's very little I can say to make you see things the way I see them. I come back to what I said earlier, what you perceive as a high value low fee service is actually a low value high fee service because of all the latent fees collected by the bank. We're not there yet, but virtually currencies have the potential to offer you a platform to significantly reduce the latent fees that you don't even know you're paying.

@_date: 2019-07-10 17:05:03
Well, that's one way to cover a short position.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:19:51
Telephones are actually a really good example.  Had we said in 1880 buy telephone poles and HODL because telephones will be around forever, we would have done well for a time, and would ultimately be right that telephones would be around for a long time, but the original telephone poles themselves are now worthless, since they were replaced ages ago and telephones in any event now operate over fiber optic cables, cell towers, satellites, etc.  
The underlying blockchain technology is a watershed and will be around in some form or other for a long time, but there's a real risk that Bitcoin is like early telephone pole infrastructure.
Edit: and by the way, everything you're saying applies (and continues to apply) to Windows too.  It was (and remains) a platform that supports applications, there was significant buy in, infrastructure, investment, training, etc.  It still got replaced by Linux, Android OS, etc. as the preeminent computing device OS and is no longer nearly as dominant (although still very much around).
Another good example is Zip drives.  They were ubiquitous in the late 90s/early 2000s; most new computers came with the readers preinstalled; high schools and nearly all colleges mandated that every student had one for backups, etc.; professionals used them to transfer files.  And just like that, we moved on.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:06:18
For sure.  Even if Bitcoin eventually becomes obsolete, it might not be in our lifetimes.  Oil was first commercially sold in the 1850s, and we're still at it 170 years later.  It will eventually get replaced by alternative energy sources, but not for at least another 20 years, and possibly not in our lifetimes.  Maybe the same is true for Bitcoin.

That's dicta, it's still technically law.  And keep in mind, however odious a decision Korematsu may have been, any attempt to overrule Korematsu would be the vanguard of an attempt by the right to undo 70 years of civil rights jurisprudence.
Point taken that this was fifth amendment and not first, but if anything, the first amendment is probably even less protected than the fifth (especially among republican justices).  Speech is routinely criminalized and subject to civil liability: illicit porn, IP infringement, corporate espionage, defamation/slander, disorderly conduct, perceived threats against elected officials, speech in class rooms and government buildings, etc.  With this court, I'd argue any criminalization of Bitcoin is an illegal taking under the fifth before arguing it's a free speech infringement under the first.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:41:19
I think what you mean to say is it's very difficult to enforce a law that bans Bitcoin.  Pretty much anything can be made "illegal" (e.g., growing certain plants in your garage).
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:09:27
The first point also applies to PayPal -- only use send money to a friend to pay people you trust.  
I think Bitcoin is great, but was just pointing out that this particular argument doesn't really hold together.  In fact, it's one reason people have a hard time wrapping their minds around the value proposition of Bitcoin.  Many of the problems Bitcoin solves for aren't perceived as problems.

Just to clarify though, if anything is criminalized, it won't be possessing Bitcoin (because, as you say, what does it even mean to possess Bitcoin - it's just a string of numbers), it will be purchasing it outside a regulated banking environment where both parties to the transaction are subject to KYC.
As to the first amendment, free speech and cryptography is not at all settled law.  The Bernstein case was decided by the Ninth circuit, an outlier circuit, not the Supreme Court. All sorts of code is routinely regulated.

I'm not a trader so I fully admit I'm talking out of my ass, but it defies logic that this should work in a market dominated by sophisticated parties who know that other sophisticated parties are trying to manipulate the price. If there is more demand than supply, then a professional trader with access to margin accounts, etc., would simply buy into the sell wall and then make a killing filling buy orders above the sell wall price. If supply is greater than demand, then a professional trader will simply ignore the sell wall and trade at the prevailing market price. The sell wall would either be a disastrous trading strategy or just noise. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:31:52
There is no way to manipulate legally.  I will let others who're more expert than me chime in, but the key is your intent.  You can certainly place buy and sell orders simultaneously, but if you are doing so in order to manipulate the market, a simple review of your trading activity will make that obvious.  I don't know if the same rules apply to retail investors (I suspect not), but retail investors also don't have the capital (typically) to move the market in the same way as an institutional investor.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:12:22
Here's what I don't get. If we had a currency that functioned as you suggest, wouldn't people just buy everything on credit (like they do now but more so)? You can pay back your bed purchase in two years when for the same money you can buy five beds. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:55:18
That's why I qualified my statement with professional traders with access to margin accounts. If a market is dominated by someone so rich that they can keep a short going in the face of professionals trading with leverage, then I agree, the market won't behave very rationally.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:57:07
I see. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:45:44
I'm not a trader, but I'm skeptical that this would work.  I am accustomed to thinking of supply and demand being independent of the order book, but I guess trader psychology being what it is, existing orders will inform appetite.  So yeah, I can see someone with an interest in buying losing some interest in the face of a giant sell order even though rationally speaking the correct thing to do would be to take the opportunity to buy.  And I guess that's what it comes down to, is the market rational or not?  If the market were mature and professionals had access to prime brokers, margin accounts, etc., then I think even if the mass of individual participants were not rational, the market would behave as if it were.  Professionals would take these manipulative whales to town by filling the full order on margin and then immediately selling for a profit.  So none of this "pull back" nonsense would work -- they would just lose their shirts and end up paying the market price for their bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:21:10

I'm just relaying common trading advice. If you are trading - i.e., buying AND selling - buying the dip can be very dangerous because you can keep amplifying your losses if the price just goes lower and lower as it did from Dec. 2017 until very recently.  If you're buying to HODL for your great grandkids, or whatever, then sure.

LOL, it's current valuation is definitely the result of a bubble and it will burst. We basically all know this. 
The second stupidest thing I've heard anyone say about bitcoin: it's a bubble! 
Well, no shit. But what do you propose to do. Buy more, sell some of it, sell all of it, short it?  What have *you* done about it with *your* money Mr talking head man?  Saying it's a bubble is not helpful. 
Third stupidest thing I've heard anyone say about bitcoin: it's not a useful currency. 
Saying it's worthless because it can't be used as a currency due to its volatility is not helpful because it doesn't address its use as a store of value. To state the obvious, you also wouldn't use gold as a currency.  The reason you wouldn't use bitcoin or gold as currency is because things are priced in dollars and not gold or bitcoin. If things were priced in bitcoin then it's *dollars* that would look volatile.

Here's a counter showerthought that I think a lot of people fail to consider: Bitcoin is a technology, and it is inevitable that it too, like all technologies that have preceded it, will be replaced by something newer (if not better).  
We like to think Bitcoin is the exception to this, but there was a time when it was inconceivable that Apple wouldn't be the most popular personal computer maker, Windows wouldn't be the most popular OS, AOL wouldn't be the most popular ISP, Myspace wouldn't be the most popular social network, or Yahoo wouldn't be the most popular search engine.
When change comes, it comes fast.
I know this might be an unpopular view on this forum, but eventual obsoletion is the most probable outcome for Bitcoin given everything we know about technology and how it progresses.

I hear that, but I think the approach then is to take an educated guess rather than a scattershot approach. If you have ten assets that are worth 1 each, and you think 1 will be worth 10, but you're concerned that 9 of them will be worth 0, investing 1 in each won't help you.

To your example, if 20% of your portfolio is in Ford, getting some GM stock would be a bad way to diversify. Ford may do better or worse than GM, but they're both subject to substantially the same risk factors. A better diversification strategy would be Google or Dow Chemical or some other company in an unrelated industry. If you're taking a bet on the auto industry, then sure, invest a bit in Ford, a bit in GM, etc., so that you isolate the effects of weirdness at each company. But the difference is that crypto currencies aren't stocks. They don't generate revenue. Winners and losers will be decided by network effect, and many will lose. So a scattershot approach in cryptos will probably result in a lot of losses coupled with a few big gains, ultimately netting to 0 or close to it.

If a bitcoin is worth some crazy amount, like a $1,000,000 or more, wouldn't there be the equivalent of digital pirate treasure hunting ventures backed by PE funds.  All this massive computing power currently directed at mining might be re-directed to hacking wallets.  Some of the lost bitcoin will probably be reclaimed by this means.

Has anyone read any books or essays that consider bitcoin from the perspective of the old Keynes/Hayek debates? I.e., what do dead English and Austrian economists think about all this? What does it mean if governments no longer have access to monetary policy?  How does this impact modern monetary theory? Etc.  Looking for something a curious lay person can understand.  Any leads are much appreciated.

I keep a monthly balance sheet.  For my bitcoin holdings, in the past I would just put in the spot price.  But now the spot price is many thousands greater than it was the last time I calculated my balance sheet.  So instead of a spot price, I would like to transition to VWAP.  Is there a website that will give me a bitcoin VWAP?

This concept of diversifying across crypto currencies is kinda stupid. So far, they are generally highly correlated. With minor exceptions, crypto currencies have been going up and down together. To really diversify assets, cash in profits and buy things *other than* crypto currencies.

Possibly, if a crash in bitcoin impacts consumer confidence. A lot of people are nominally financially secure right now due to the spike in price of bitcoin and other virtual currencies and might feel comfortable making big purchases on credit in reliance on prices staying stable. If prices plummet, appetite for big purchases will decline, causing an economic slow down.

The gun rights activists would have you believe banning and regulating are one and the same.  While I think they speak in hyperbole, I think there is a degree of regulation that would indeed render it a ban.

If you hold gold, it would be bad diversification strategy to buy silver. Hard to imagine a scenario where gold drops but silver rises. You could maybe buy iron or platinum or something.... Maybe industry is doing well and those metals are in demand at a time that the price of gold drops. But your better diversification strategy would be to buy stocks, bonds or other assets that are not metals.

Take this recent run as a  example.  The price just went from a little over 3.5 to 14.  Had you bought at, say, every 20% increase, you would have bought at 4.3, 5.2, etc., and then sold it all for a nice profit on the way back down. If you bought only at the dip, then you played yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:17:24
Buying the dip after it hit $18k would have put you in a world of pain from which you would have as of yet not recovered.   Even if you bought the dip from the most recent $14k high, you would not have recovered.  The correct strategy was to buy when it went from 3 to 4 to 5, etc., and sell when it went from 14 to 12.
Simply buying on the way up and selling on the way down would have netted you actual gains.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:18:21
As any trader will tell you, buy on the way up, sell on the way down.  "Buy the dip" is a fool's gamble because no one can tell you where the dip begins or ends until it's done.

Securities laws have probably protected more non accredited investors than they have prevented from investing for the simple reason that non accredited investors don't have much to invest but stand to lose a great deal relative to what they have. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:28:38
Like I said, if you're not selling to US persons and you're not selling in the US, then the SEC doesn't care what you do for the obvious reason that you're not selling to US persons and you're not selling in the US. But you still need to comply with the laws of whatever jurisdiction you're selling into.

The view is those guys don't need the protection of the law because they can afford lawyers, accountants and advisors. You're right that plenty of rich people aren't sophisticated, but networth and income are the best proxies we have. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:38:57
This headline is garbage.  The SEC doesn't care about Bitcoin because it's not a security.  They have jurisdiction over funds that issue securities backed by Bitcoin, and they have legitimate concerns regarding those funds unrelated to the "hackability" of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:34:30
Many tokens fall in the category of "investment contracts," which are "securities" under the 33 Act.

Right, and happily we have regulatory tools to pursue the most dangerous kind of scams: those offered to the public. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:25:36
Just to be clear, public companies can advertise securities offerings to non accredited investors all they want. You're free to invest as much or as little as you want into publicly listed companies. The restriction isn't on your ability to invest, it's on a company's ability to advertise its offering. If they want to sell securities to 10,000 non accredited investors at 100 pop, they're free to do so, so long as they register.
Edit: they can also do so through the new crowd funding regulations, but no one uses that.

The thing about fraud is once it happens there's little you can do to unwind it. That money is gone like a fart in the wind. That's why the securities laws say if you are publicly soliciting investment, you can only speak to people with a certain networth or income. The idea is, networth/income is a proxy for sophistication. Someone worth 200k is, in theory anyway, better able to sniff out a fraud than a poor old granny. That person is also able to withstand the loss better. Securities laws have been around for 85 years and, all things considered, they actually work pretty well. Case in point, they are flexible enough to apply to ICOs, something that no one could have imagined in 1933.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:47:13
This is wrong. You can invest in whatever you want. Issuers can't ask you to invest through a public solicitation if you're not an accredited investor. And by the way, crypto tokens that are securities are subject to the same laws.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:21:12
The *Howey* test is the test to determine whether certain transactions are "investment contracts," which are statutorily defined as securies. He does not suggest that all ICOs satisfy the *Howey* test, but let's be real: if a token is being sold with the promise of profits, it's probably a security. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:34:40
If you're not selling to US persons and you're not selling in the US, then the SEC doesn't care what you do for the obvious reason that you're not selling to US persons and you're not selling in the US. But you still need to comply with the laws of whatever jurisdiction you're selling into.

I'm sorry, but that's really dumb. Just like lawyers apply the constitution to novel things that didn't exist in 1788, religious scholars apply their holy texts to novel things. Just because bitcoin is hip and exciting doesn't mean it's the first new thing ever not to be covered by the religious text.

I'm no scholar of Islam, but my understanding is that while the Quran is understood to be the verbatim word of god, there's also Sunna and Tasfir, which are bodies of text that interpret the Quran.  I defer to the first person who actually knows about these topics, but I believe that main Islamic bodies do opine on financial structures and arrangements as presented. It's a lot like the administrative law process in the US, whereby regulators will issue interpretative guidance from time to time as novel facts materialize (see, e.g., The SEC's DAO Report).  As for documents being drafted by infallible men, I don't really think that's the point. Sure, there are some fundamentalists that take the Quran literally, but there are also fundamentalists who take the constitution literally (or at least when convenient for their cause). See, e.g., Scalia and the originalist school.
