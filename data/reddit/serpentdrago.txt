Miners do not Verify the transactions Only full nodes enforce consensus rules , they just stuff it in a block and start hashing . Syncing up to the blockchain faster allows them to Hash the next block as that hash is BASED on the last block . 
tl;dr  you can't even start hashing the next block before you have the last block . so  ,faster receiving of that last block (sync'd) gives you an advantage . 
Remember AT SCALE , every milisecond can make a diffrence

Segwit 
 effectively raising the block capacity to 1.4 MB of transactions.
source ? cause its not 4 MB
NO fucking way is BTC block limit 4MB where the fuck did you hear that ?

they can get sync'd faster , which means they can start mining that block faster . You can't mine if you don't have enough to fill a block yet 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:09:47
the faster your connection to the network the faster you can start working on mining a block . 
If you centralize your miners , you have a jump start on starting mining faster cause you will sync faster

you have to understand mining is big big big business. at that scale 1/2 percent advantage can make a difference. a huge difference. you only get paid if you win the block.

its a log scale used to show Percentage changes .. learn how to read a chart .. *facepalm*

True

Thanks !

very true i was simplistic in my explanation. i mean they don't verify the whole block chain concences rules

DO not take a picture of it with your phone . Do not send whats on that card though ANY electronic means . whats on that card basically is the KEYS to that bitcoin

its already 150 gigs to run a full node .. wtf happens when the block size goes up ? 
Bigger blocks is NOT the answer .. but .. i will agree .. my bee a slight bump to 2M blocks could help ease us into LN

and what happens if you loose your phone or it gets broken ? 
how do you recover all your authy 2fa codes

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:48:13
you do understand you can use google 2fa on authy right ? 
I have Authy only . works for every 2fa site i've ever seen , including google 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:05
I'm sure it does. it uses standard 2fa

ok so from what i've learned so far , please tell me if i'm wrong . 
In this picture 
If the person would have just put a limit price in , he could have saved himself from selling of ETH below a cretin point . ? 
Stop Sells , put in a normal market order at the stop price when reached but they could be filled even lower  , but if you use a Stop Limit , you are protected if orders are filed lower then your stop Price ? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:22:03
could you go in more depth about the "trade for 2.3 ETH" what kinda trade can do that ? I'm just now learning how markets work . And i've learned some basics but anything besides a normal buy / sell order i'm still learning . 
So he put in a BUY order for 2.3 eth at what value ?  Give me the exact terms used and i'll google it , Thanks for the help !
I do understand how someone dumping ETH on the market to sell would fill up the buy orders and drive the price down , i get that part . I'm just trying to understand the types of buys that could cause you to loose 120,000 at the time worth of eth 
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:46:34


I get margin is borrowed against a share you hold . could you explain or link to me where i can learn about how that causes you to loose 120,000 for a trade currently valued at 800 ? 
i'm almost there , just need some help
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:34:13
the name is HORID , who the fuck thought Lite .. Coin was a good fucking name ? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:14:10
so he bought 2.3 ETH on a loan .. backed by ETH itself .. 
That .. is .. sooo fucking stupid lol . I dont' even trade i'm just learning and that sounds like a idiot move . 
If your Collateral crashs and you have a buy order for the same thing that Collateral is based on .. just wow ..
