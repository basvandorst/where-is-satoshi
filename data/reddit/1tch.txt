I'm wrong, yet you somehow think Bitcoin will be adopted as a world currency.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:34:54
Armstrong also said Bitcoin is waaay off from being adopted.

Starbucks is so fucking expensive that BTC is the only way to afford it. Not to mention those paying with BTC will regret that decision when their coffee purchase ends up being 2500/cup in another year or so.

Which is why it will never be more than store of value.

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:11:13
The majority of the hash rate is controlled by 3 mining operations in China. They certainly aren't going anywhere, however the rest of the world (besides South America where electricity is cheap) will no longer continue to mine because of deminshing returns.

These machines are about to become as obsolete as Red Box.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:49:56
I would argue that you are pioneers of a new commodity. You're digital gold. Store use only.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:40:23
If you listen close enough you can hear the sounds of miners slowly turning off all their machines.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:33:08
Lightening network is a second layer protocol that has too many vulnerabilities. Don't be excited about it. Accept the fact Bitcoin will never be adopted and will remain store use only.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:45:21
Miners are about to turn off their machines.
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:55:23
Nope, but proof of work is a dinosaur. It costs most of the world about 6k to mine a Bitcoin. The moment Bitcoin drops below 6k miners will turn off their machines and the party is over.
Edit: downvotes because the truth hurts lol

lol proof of work
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:58:11
Some say 100k per coin which is nuts.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:12:52
The majority of the world is averaged at about 6k to mine a single coin. The only region that has a benefit of cheap electricity is South America which is somewhere in the range of 1800-2000. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:52:26
Bitcoin has no use case. It's digital gold. Store value only. And forever will be. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:25:52
They're threatening to sell off their BTC and use it for BCH SV. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:09:25
China controlled hash rate, proof of work is dated, network is slow af, there's no adoption for BTC. Store use only. No utility value whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:15:41
Decentralized as in China will continue to control 51%+ of Bitcoins network?
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:29:11
It's garbage because it's a second layer protocol, not because it's barely off the ground. Lightening is not going to help adoption. Like I said before there are other coins that move fast, cheaper, and hold more on their networks. 
Don't be salty, just accept Bitcoin is and always will be store use. Digital gold commodity. There's nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:59:44
Ok, yet you can't challenge my claims because I'm right. Gg 
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:07:22
Another comment from somebody that doesn't understand the technology and why a second layer protocol developed by a 3rd party is a bad idea....
Bitcoin is a locomotive, it was first, will always be respected, but unfortunately nobody would choose to travel on a locomotive anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:58:39
Look at this dinosaur. It might as well be a Red Box.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:54:51
You don't know wtf you're talking about...
Bitcoin will NEVER be adopted globally for any use case whatsoever. If you believe it will, you're fucking stupid.
It can only process 4 transactions per second, and expensive as fuck. There's plenty of other "shitcoins" that can and will out perform Bitcoin with no sweat.  
Just accept what Bitcoin is, a commodity, digital gold, store use only. There's nothing wrong with that. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 01:31:59
Man, I don't even know where to begin....
It's the most well known because it was first and has name recognition from the plebes.
Miners are and will become irrelevant. Proof of work is a dinosaur and doesn't deserve any recognition for keeping a network safe from bad actors.
Truly decentralized nature? This is comical, please, tell me how you can believe that when 51%+ of its network is controlled by China and only more than 50% of Bitcoin is controlled by less than 1000 wallets? 
But sure, keep believing it's "truly decentralized".  LOL
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:29:53
Understanding your weak analogy doesn't support a defense against what I've been saying. Notice how you resort to ad homonym to deflect my point. Lightening Network will NEVER, EVER, give Bitcoin adoption. You are glossing right over the facts. It's slower, expensive, and can't support maximum transactions. 
Bitcoin is and always will be store use only. Digital gold. That's it. Stop fighting me on this. Accept it.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:00:07
Doesn't matter, it all comes down to the point it is proof of work. I'm no bcasher but understand you have a vested interest in protecting your coin of choice. But at the end of the day there's plenty or other tokens that are infinitly superior.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:09:36
You have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:26:02
The lightening network is garbage. It's a second layer protocol. There are so many other tokens that transfer faster, cheaper, and can handle more at a time. Bitcoin even with lightening network will never help it become adopted. Just accept the fact it's store use only.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:39:07
That's why people upvote me and not you right? Fucking idiot.
