Is this really good enough though? Think about it, what if people had to keep the current fiat system in place. Like if they had to make sure they didn't store too much in one bank (think hashrate), and had to spread it across smaller banks.
Now I know that storing bitcoins has no issue, as you can store any amount in a single wallet / address, but I do feel that the protocol needs to show a better resilience.
I believe it can be done, and will love Bitcoin more when the certainly of success is more clear!

You could make the same complaint with almost every online store.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:44:15
Yeah I'm aware that the current store front I am using does not look as official as the top shops, nor having an actual business location. But I am hoping that I can take this off the ground and improve it into having an actual decent storefront!
This is mostly just experimenting with Bitcoin!

Ah wow that error in the title now invalidates my entire post.
To my defense I just put a placeholder title until I was sure in which direction I wanted to talk about, got caught up writing my post, forgot to change the title whoops.
I guess the title is the only part 90% of people have read so that is all they can comment about? Haha.

International shipping would probably cost extra I'm afraid. As for the amount I will have to do some looking up. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:48:36
Yeah, thanks for the suggestion I really appropriate it. The platform I am using it pretty limited. I like it showing the price in bitcoin, but I do agree that having the full 8 decimals is bad.
@_date: 2014-06-15 12:41:25
That was my opinion, the network should be able to by itself without any intervention of which pool people are using.
That is what I mean, if Bitcoin is going to die (which it will not) by people being careless in mining, it won't become a well adopted currency. I'm sorry that are the facts.
What I am saying is that for bitcoin to succeed it needs to be able to withstand both malicious and careless people. This also includes wallet safety.
I think there are much bigger problems than mining centralization to be honest.

Mostly picked only the items I thought would sell from main shop.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:25:59
I'm sorry if the prices are too high. I am unable to get them as low as most retail shops, combine that with not charging shipping is why the prices are higher. :(
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:25:04
I do not agree, and the network should be able to take care of itself. If we have to be worried about the network rebelling due to pools giving huge benefits, the protocol is broken.
Its sad to say, but if reaching "51%" breaks it and requires everyone to ask everyone to move, it is. But.. It's not, people need to make their own decisions.
Look, you are all saying about the centralization of Ghash, but what about Blockchain.info? They could easily lie about everything on that chart, or transactions on the blockchain, no one seems to be complaining about that one, eh?
But blaming everyone is useless, so instead lets think up a way to fix the issue with either bitcoin core code, or provide a good incentive to migrate elsewhere, even with 0% fee, p2pool does not support merged mining.

Thanks, trying to do my part into making Bitcoin have more places to spend, as well as seeing how big on an impact BTC has on a business!
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:27:51
Thanks for the suggestions, maybe I could :D
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:29:00
Haha, awesome, yeah I hope that they get forced into taking Bitcoin or having to close business. xD
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:53:19
Even if you do not have your port open you are still helping the network, by mirroring the blockchain, relaying blocks / transactions, etc.
I would agree that a node with 100+ connections is much more usual than one only 8 outbound connections, but you are still helping the network.
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:07:24
Sounds awesome!
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:21:30
Yeah, of course, I just put some items in stock which I thought would be most popular.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:07:38
I know this would not happen but.. How funny it would be if their bank account was closed for selling bitcoins. xD
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:50:48
Personally I prefer having only BTC prices up there. However I do set the price set in USD, which is converted to BTC. So you may see the price changing every so often.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:28:36
I should be able to ship there, will have to check on international shipping.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:39:05
I will say that is never the option, and why start doing illegal things? Even if they are evil, is that really right?
But the money it would cost would totally not be worth it, you would probably be better off buying mining equipment and mining elsewhere, especially since it would just be temporary.
Also does that look good for the community of bitcoin, and help towards its legal status? "Bitcoin community attacks biggest pool with a DDOS attack, to stop mining centralization."
I think people think of a 51 attack as too much, assuming 6 blocks of confirmations required, you would be getting 150 btc just by mining.
It is a really interesting attack (51%), but I think that is better than getting involved with illegal attacks like DDOS on a host which has presumably done nothing wrong (debatable).
-- Basically I am not saying not to fight it, by all means do, just in a more civil professional way. Also why are we trying to make rules for people to follow, the point is decentralization, shouldn't it be everything  possible in the code is allowed? (obviously law will override). 
If we start making a rulebook of what is allowed, like pools must stay below 40% is pretty silly, it shouldn't be an issue, but then again from my understanding pools are the problem, if everyone solo mined like Bitcoin was designed for, it would most likely still be fine.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:03:36
Don't think it is possible actually, I do intend of upgrading this store. This is more of a "test run", to see if making a professional store is worth the time and money.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:02:04
Yeah this would be awesome! I think the fluctuation would have to stop, or having digital screens auto update the price. (Otherwise you would have to keep printing labels). Shamefully the current platform I am using doesn't really support much customization unfortunately. But if all goes well I have plans to upgrade this store into a more professional store.
Of course it will still be a bitcoin store! :D
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:29:24
I pretty much just set up a small shop, if it does well I could see about integrating it into something bigger!
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:10:06
The moral of the story is that: Your bitcoins are always at risk if you do not care to secure them, treat it the same as you should with cash. Would you leave $15,000 in your wallet, or in a little safe?
No? Then why should it be different with bitcoin, if you want to keep a large amount (especially as an investment for months or years), then either invest in a cold wallet / proven security such as Trezor. Or use a secure wallet such as Coinbase (people may hate this, but truthfully is more secure than on a typical hard drive).
Hope this helps others, just remember that any software (no matter how legitimate) can have issues, or be hacked. The best thing is to keep nothing of value on your computer, so if it is hacked then it will not be a huge loss. Keep a little in a hot wallet (less than 1 btc), encrypt it using a pasephrase (which you can remember or keep on a piece of paper safe).
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:40:35
Yeah, I would say there a disadvantages people miss. Obviously to some that is a benefit that you are in total control (nobody can freeze your money), obviously at times it is good in terms of getting hacked. 
However this extra security you are talking about can happen to the account owner if they make a "suspicious transaction", like withdrawing a large amount or logging on while on holiday, etc.
Anyway thanks for pitching something in, personally I prefer the prevent gaining access rather than the stopping from doing anything with it. As the latter effects the legitimate user's access.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:26:31
No.. I'm pretty sure if the price was influenced by Ghash, it was not because of the "gready" miners mining at Ghash. If anything it would be all of the FUD posts here every single day about Ghash reaching "51%", or saying that they have attacked other sites/pools.
As much as I love the reddit bitcoin community, it annoys me to see the same post again and again, blockchain.info does not report the correct proportion of hash rate, just the amount of blocked mined in the time frame, so just because they had a lucky week everyone thinks Ghash has grown.
I am not saying that centralized mining is a good thing, but I do not think it is a good thing telling everyone what to do. Instead it would be better to make the alternatives better to ease.
-- Also just so people do not take it as I am siding with anyone, I do not mine Bitcoin (anywhere near enough to be a proper miner) just enough to actually learn the process of how it works, and things.
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:19:13
Second one I see blaming Ghash / miners of it today.. You might be mad that the price is dropped and that a pool is nearing "51%". But lets not start blaming and scaring them.
Anyway, who said they lost money, if they are smart and do not panic sell, and are in it for the long term bitcoin they will not of lost money, short term spikes.
Obviously there are many miners who have to sell bitcoins to pay the bills, and where is your proof of this? The price is down and Ghash has been nearing "51%" for a long time now, todays drop is their fault!!
I think the bitcoin community would be much better to communicate and respect other members rather than trying to separate them.
In this, what I mean is why? All of these posts about Ghash I have seen have not really explained anything but "51%".
Even if most Bitcoin members hate to hear this, but I would rather have a 51 attack happen right now (double spend, or denial the network), have a big drop in price and see that it wasn't that big of a deal and recover, rather than everyone being worried..
Although I do not want that to happen, I feel that would actually help Bitcoin in the long run, as there is little harm which can be done other than people thinking it is "broken"..
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:27:58
Thanks, I love the Bitcoin community! xD
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:05:38
what spelling mistakes? Just checking it I found 1 word "geting" so thanks I guess.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:40:20
Sorry about that, yeah I set the prices in USD and it converts automatically. I do not think I am able to round it, but I will see what I can do! :)
