Out of the loop here, What is the significance of that?

Thank you for not being a smart-ass like most of the other comments (like I said I'm new).  I understand that it is not that easy, I guess what I am looking to understand is *why* it isn't that easy?  What are the blockers?
Edit * So one blocker I see is that transaction deposits and accruals aren't instant. This could be a non-issue if you have enough money to play with.  What are the others?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:37:06
I'm afraid I don't understand the chart. Is the red/green mean that it's just down from the average or?  Which ones did you buy at and which ones did you sell at?  Is it working out alright for you?

There is a lot to that question.  Short answer is that no, it's not like gambling at all.  Doesn't mean it's not risky though. However you can minimize your risk if you look big picture.  If you are serious about swing trading or day trading you can message me and I'll DM you back.

Bruh you gonna get rekt listening to people on Reddit.  Remember there's a 50% chance this dude is right even if he has *no clue what he's talking about whatsoever*.  
Chances of it staying at 9k in the next month - 0%.  Chances of it dumping or pumping -100%.  And even then it could always get back to 9k when the run is finished.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:55:30
Whales would sell then buy back in at 9k just like they did on the 30th.

A lot of people like Gemini if you're in the states.  I am not sure if they have the same thing going on though.  
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:59:56
Yup.  Probably a good business decision for them in terms of reducing risk.  They might lose money but would lose way more if the IRS came down on them for aiding money laundering or tax evasion.  It sucks but it makes sense from a business owner perspective.

No lol.  You can withdrawal into fiat still.  This is about stopping sending or receiving crypto, neither of which is preventing you from just cashing out and using another fiat gateway.

'Random' fluctuations in crypto are too common for there to be a real pattern that emerges that you can reliably trade on. The TA people will try to tell you otherwise but they are full of shit.  TA absolutely works in a mature and involitile market.  Crypto is neither for now.
The only pattern is 'randomness' (or what appears to be random to us, it's not really random), and the only certainty is that some coins are better off trading than others in case you get bags- don't trade coins you wouldn't also hold.  That being said, swing trading crytpo is *extremely* profitable if you know what you are doing.

What do Indians have to do with any of this
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:06:05


Maybe not missing anything per se, as you are correct about the taxes.  However, lets say you make 4000 worth of trades (keep in mind this is 4k above just holding) then you pay 22-37% on that.  Well, you're still up, right?   
It's not for the risk-adverse- it's inherently more risky.  There are some ways to minimize the risk but Crypto itself is inherently risky and this adds an additional risk factor.  But, as crypto is so volatile, there is a TON of money to be made over just holding.  Just my thoughts.

Because there was a very real possibility that it was going to keep falling.  There was bad news after bad news day after day, and the market reacted to it.  Some people (not I) thought crypto was going to die.  It was bad.  Like, real bad.  Don't get me wrong, the news wasn't really that bad.  But the reaction was.  It was like that kids' story, Chicken Little (the sky is falling!).
That very same thing could happen again, there is literally nothing stopping it from crashing again.  Not that it will happen, but it could.  I personally am hoping it does in about a month or so, so I can accumulate again.

Nope. They just said that they would not make it official legal tender for now.  The same way that the US dollar isn't.  If it became legal tender then merchants would be required to take it.  
So essentially the headlines are reading India Bans Crypto!  But nothing of the sort has happened.

Okey dokey.  300 BTC sold at 8k, bought at 7k leaves you with about $180k after taxes.  You have no idea how much he bought / sold, ergo no idea how much he made.  You are somehow trying to dispute basic math.  Makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:40:31


I was going to mention this point as well but figured it was a bit off topic but since you brought it up, I agree completely. The next crash that happens people will not freak out as much, will be less likely to sell, and more likely to buy the dip.  The bottom will also be higher.

There is more money to be made trading than holding.  They know this on some level but are scared to do it, so they cut other people down that trade- all to make themselves feel better.
