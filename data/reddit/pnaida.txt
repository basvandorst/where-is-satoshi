I'm pretty sure the only way you can get the B2X is if you keep it in an exchange. Not sure though, I'm pretty new to this.

What is the benefit of having your coins in an exchange? Mine are stored on coinbase right now (I know its bad), however I was planning on transferring to a paper wallet soon.

How much do you have invested if you don't mind me asking. Just wondering how much other people are buying.

I hope not. I just want a correction

I think the motive of the people who want to sell is to sell everything before the price drops and then buy back in again when its much lower. Not sure though, I would like to know too since I've never even sold BTC before.

I want to buy more bitcoin but the price is rising so much I feel like I will be able to get it for a lot cheaper in the near future. What do you guys think, when should we be buying?

I am new to bitcoin myself however what I think they were saying is that once the fork happens, you will be awarded some Bitcoin2X based on how much Bitcoin you have (you will keep all your original bitcoin as well). This means if you have one bitcoin at the time of the fork, they will give you 1 Bitcoin2X and that will be it. It sounds like free money however the price of Bitcoin might suffer for a bit.
