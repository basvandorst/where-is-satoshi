It's not surprising, they feel threatened

I think OP is trying to create a challenge where it would be impossible to brute-force even if you have all the words but one.
A treasure hunt unbiased by brute-force, in other words.

If we consider that the bip39 wordlist was used (2048 words), that would be 737,869,762,948,382,064,640 possibilities (without the hint)

If you can remember part of the password (its length, start or end,...) or if you have a list of potential passwords, you can try to brute-force with this  password recovery tool: [

I remember a similar challenge on bitcointalk, where a 6 letters bip38 encrypted private key couldn't be cracked.

Congratulations tarje
You were incredibly lucky to find the right word after only 45 of 7,000 attempts.
(6 !)\*10\*7000=50,400,000
Testing all the possibilities at a rate of 30 per second would have taken 1,680,000 seconds = 28,000 minutes = 466.67 hours = 19.44 days!

I don't know what kind of challenge you're going to launch, but if you want to make brute force almost impossible by using only English words in lowercase, here are some suggestions:
\- use a larger dictionary, containing more words
\- use a longer password, with more words
6! =  720
7! = 5,040
8! = 40,320

Two possibilities come to my mind:
\- generate a Time Locked Address, using for example Coinbin: [  
\- create a MultiSig address (e.g. 2-of-3 multi signature address: the mother, the father and you). A multisig address can be generated with Electrum for example.
