The funny thing is that if you say that Jews have a lot of money or power, then you are anti-semitic, but if that is in the context of history or good news (often related to business), then you are simply savvy about the world and just know what's what.

Him being of Russian nationality is relevant as it gives insight as what the outlook of Bitcoin in that country might be. I have never heard somebody's ethnicity or religion being news in relation to Bitcoin before. That's like saying, "American-Atheist investors keen on bitcoin", or "Catholic regulators to drop the book on crypto-currencies".

Do the guys at really use the image of Dorian as a goofy joke? Seriously, how incredibly unclassy and abusive is that? Am I the only one that thinks this is way out of line?

Instead of trying to be petty and insulting, could you try characterising what kind of an influence Jewish people have and how it is relevant to Bitcoin?

But that information is already conveyed through the word "billionnaire". What is it about him being Jewish that is exceptionally relevant here?

It is also the bane of tens of thousands of independent artists. Don't try to feel good about piracy because you think it only affects the big guys. It doesn't. In fact, the big guys are still out and about, while countless smaller guys were swept away.

Yeah, can you believe they were saying that, when in fact the initial bubble was caused by Mt Gox. When you face the facts they were really just embellishing the truth.

They are going to turn karma into a full-fledged cryptocurrency. I can't even imagine all the possibilities. This is huge.

Yeah bro, people who use Bitcoin are clever and people who don't are dumb, great, you'll win over a lot of people with that attitude.
