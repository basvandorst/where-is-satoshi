You know there are index mutual funds, right? And they existed before any ETF existed? And there are much lower fees that 0.25%. Fidelity Schwab and vanguard all have &lt; 0.05% fees on a couple index mutual funds (and ETFs)

What do you mean the cost of a transaction is $90? How do you figure that?

This doesn't make any sense. See [Barebone Computer](

So who is paying for the archival nodes that need racks upon racks of disks when Bitcoin is the primary transaction-processing system? you can't just hope "hardware advances faster than Bitcoin usage does." Hasn't the transactions per second increased much more in the past 3-5 years than the capacity/economy of storage?

How can you run a full node and have a pruned blockchain? Don't other nodes need to be able to download the entire blockchain from a full node?

When Bitcoin processes the most transactions. When it is closer to the million TPS mentioned by than the 7 it is supposedly at right now.

TVs suck for monitors. Crap refresh rate, usually crap resolution, and usually too big and not near a table.

This is ridiculous. Most of the "victimless" crimes listed at  are mostly illegal because they promote/incite violence or are endangering to other people. This is more typical ultra-libertarianism. I support bitcoin and like the idea of a free currency controlled by nobody, by why is everyone on such a borderline anarchist?

Hey great reading comprehension.

Why is this funny?

Yes, tax is owed when profit is realized. Any exchange or trade is taxable profit or deductible loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:51:41
No it is not. The crypto has not changed. You bought 1 BTC at $6000/BTC. It appreciates to $7000/BTC. At this point you trade to your 1 BTC for 234 BTD. At that moment, you realized $1000 of capital gain and you owe tax on it.
I didn't make the rules, you don't have to try to convince me they don't make sense.

You don't pay tax in crypto. You must record/remember the profit you realized so you can pay tax on that amount in USD. If you bought a baseball card and it appreciated by $1000, then traded it for a car, you would owe income tax on the $1000 appreciation (capital gain) and you may owe sales tax to your state/municipality for purchase of the car. 
If you bought a baseball card, it appreciated, and you traded it for a different baseball card, you would owe the same capital gains tax.
This is all for US.

Jesus Christ if this is your thinking when you're married, then you shouldn't be married. Shit happens and things change sometimes after you get married. But if you aren't ready to be 100% honest with your partner then don't get married in the first place.

You just pick a reputable source and use that one consistently. E.g. record the current gdax price every trade. Your trade history on an exchange already has that info.
It is much more difficult to establish fair market value for collectibles, especially rare ones. Digital goods are easy-peasy.

Did the definition of "rich" change?
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:30:52
You got something from nothing. There's no way your cost basis is not $0. The bigger question is, would this be a dividend, potentially qualified? Or capital gains, that could be held for one year to be long-term capital gains?

How do those things encourage people to go into debt? How does inflation cause low interest rates?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:23:51
That's an interesting question.
Maybe at the time you first realize any gain (you first sell or exchange the BTC or BCH) the original cost basis would be divided evenly between both coins, relative to the market value at the time. So if you sold the BCH when it was 1/5 the value of the BTC, then your cost basis would be divided - 1/6 to the BCH you just sold and 5/6 to the unsold BTC.
Or maybe you just get to pick which coin is $0 basis and which is not and go from there. If you eventually sold both holdings, it wouldn't matter because the IRS would get the same total tax. I think.
