@_date: 2013-11-19 17:21:08
Use the fucking search for ffs! This has been answered at least 100 times!
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:20:28
Stop the fucking reposts you fucking idiots! 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:12:02
Use the fucking search you fucking idiot! It's been asked about 100 times in the last 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:00:38
You think they give a shit? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:19:29
No, nobody noticed it. We don't have charts and you are the first to mention it. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:38:38
Piss off with these posts you annoying idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:29:19
No the real moron is the person who asks the same question that has been asked about 150 times already because he is too damn stupid to use the search. 
Oh and i own a shitload of coins that i bought for a fraction of what you are about spend. Please tell me again how i am the moron here. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:33:29
Stop answering these people. There are 10 topics a day about and he could easily use the search. This shit has top stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:17:59
Use the goddamn search you annoying idiot!
It's been answered 100 times by now!
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:35:10
Damn! You player you! Gonna sign right up! Show me the moooney!
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:07:10
Sure, just throw some Bitcoin at it and everything will be fine. That's how it works in your fantasy land right?
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:37:31
Look at the goddamn sidebar. It has many links with answers. And it also has a search. Guess what it's for. No really, take a fucking guess.
It's to avoid you from being the 150th person to ask this question. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:10:11
Discussed 100's of times before. Use the search or Google. Hiow fucking hard can it be. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:26:06
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:36:35
People should be banned for posting this. 
I cringe so hard when i read another "we're here" at a random spot on that worthless chart. 
You have to be missing some braincells if you even think about posting this again. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:26:51
Use the fucking search!
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:50:09
Right. And with claims how Bitcoin could easily be 100k per coin on your page i'll make sure to stay away. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:12:01
No! Fucking use the search here! It's asked 5 times a day and it's annoying as fuck!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:40:03
It works by using the fucking links in the sidebar. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:47:18
Stop the fucking reposts you idiots! How hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:21:44
Fucking stop these posts already you dumb fucking morons. It's fucking posted every fucking 15 minutes!
You're a complete fucking idiot if you still use them. Now stop posting this shit. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:56:36
Stop asking the same fucking question 20 times a day you idiots! It's annoying as fuck and nobody can answer it anyway!
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:07:10
Ffs stop these posts! This is insane!
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:43:09
You start by using the sidebar to your right and not asking the same question has been asked and answered 30 times a day. Yes really 30 times a day!
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:59:50
Great. ANOTHER thread about it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:47:41
Jesus fucking Christ! Not only is this asked 10 fucking times a day, nobody obviously can answer this! Do you think anybody here can look into to the future or what?
And why the fuck do you think that search button is sitting there to your right? Take a guess what it does!
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:48:02
Stop fucking asking the same thing every other hour you fucking annoying idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:43:37
I assume that you are getting a 100k loan and sell everything you own? I mean if i knew this was a fact then i'd be doing that for sure.
OR...are you just stoned and talking out of your ass?
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:30:35
If you are worried it is already been asked then why do you still refuse to use the search?
You would've found about 200 topics that tell you you won't make any money. 
But thanks for starting yet another topic on it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:30:47
Why don't you look it up yourself you prick!
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:59:08
Do a search man. There are 200 topics that give you answers. Why do you people refuse to use the search and ask the same shit day after day after day? Why?
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:21:16
Fucking hell! This has been asked and answered about 100 times! Why do you idiots REFUSE to use the search! Why!
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:48:45
Yes we know you fucking moron! Because it's been posted every fucking 15 minutes! Fucking idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:56:25
Awesome man! You just made your own to the moon post! Just what this place needed!
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:37:14
Do you seriously think you're the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:45:37
What makes you think that anybody here has an answer? Why even bother asking? I don't understand these posts all fucking day long. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:15:07
People are such idiots for panic selling! I can't believe they fall for it over and over again. They will never learn!
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:06:57
We got it after 5 posts.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:43:12
Stop these fucking posts already! This is insane! Idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:49:25
Yes we know. Because it's posted every 30 minutes. Just fucking stop it already you annoying idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:11:20
You obviously don't seem to realize what those rats are doing. Not sure how you missed it after 200 posts. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:29:03
These annoying and childish posts really need to stop soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:44:12
Impossible to predict. No matter how much of a guru you are. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:45:39
Yes we know! it's been posted 10 times already hours ago!
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:23:34
Stop acting like these are facts, you idiot kids. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:33:27
Fucking awesome man! This nonsense has only been posted 5 times today! 
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:06:39
Stop the fucking reposts! How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:45:12
Pathetic piece of shit. Get a fucking life!
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:37:57
You will be here crying in a week from now how they screwed you over. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:26:31
I hope by that time people finally learned how to use the fucking search instead of asking the same question for the 100th time!
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:31:10
Yes we know you fucking idiot! It's been posted about 50 times half a week ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:39:44
How about you stop reposting old news. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:01:20
You had 8.5 million dollars sitting on your computer without a backup? Not buying it. Sorry. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:27:09
Stop the fucking reposts you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:54:14
By using the fucking search and the links on the sidebar! Are you blind?
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:50:47
Yes we know fucking moron. 300 people before you posted about the same problem. 
Just piss off
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:55:10
Stop fucking asking the same thing every 10 minutes you fucking idiots! Nobody can look into the future here! Really, nobody! I know it's incredibly hard to believe but it's true!
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:58:51
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 10 times already. 
Can you people PLEASE stop with the insane amounts of reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:40:54
Stop the fucking reposts!
Come on man! It's on top of the mainpage and next to that posted several times already.
What makes you possibly think you are the first to post this!
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:31:39
It's because you are an idiot who can't spell their name right!
Fucking moron!
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:13:06
Yes we know because 5 people posted it before you!
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:36:43
Stop fucking asking this question 20 times a day you goddamn fucking idiots! This is insane!
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:31:51
Stop answering these people or this will never stop! Let them use the search!
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:10:20
Stop asking this every 30 minutes you fucking retards! Nobody here can look into the future! Really, nobody!
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:31:15
Yes. Tons of people have problems with them. That's why they start 10 threads a day about them. Which you could've seen if you did a search before posting. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:06:18
Stop fucking posting the same thing over and over again you idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:49:40
Funniest and dumbest thread i read in a while. I think i just lost a lot of braincells. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:06:54
If only you kids would create another subreddit so you can post this annoying and childish shit there all day. As much as you want. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:19:56
Awesome article. As always. What would this place be without you. Besides 50% less reposts and crappy articles of course. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:33:46
Don't you see the fucking sidebar to your right? It has all the info there. And above it is the search button. If you use it you will see this question asked and answered about 300 times!
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:18:23
Stop flooding this place with this childish shit you annoying fucking kids! I wish they would start banning people for posting this shit all day long. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:42:01
Surprised? 
This place is completely filled with reposts. It's annoying as fuck. Just don't fucking repost old shit and nobody will say a word and you won't be "surprised". 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:23:45
Stop the fucking reposts you goddamn idiot! 
Look at the fucking date! What makes possibly think you are the first to post this 1 week old news!
Why do you REFUSE to search before posting?
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:06:32
You may have noticed this is the Bitcoin reddit.
I'm reporting your post.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:05:52
Come on man. You can't possibly think this wasn't posted already. 
How hard can it be not to repost something?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:44:57
What bubble? The price went up because of tons of new people buying. It went up a bit too fast. We got a correction and now we're back on track, hopefully a bit slower.
What exactly do you expect when 1000's of new people a day want to get in? That the price stays at 250 or so?
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:18:22
Very good news. It means they most likely won't ban it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:09:15
By using the fucking search and read the 200 topics with the same questions. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:13:41
Only about 100. 
But he obviously refuses to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:40:23
Yes annoying kid. We know. It's already been posted 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:18:05
Haha all those downvotes!
Reality hurts i see! Guess who looks like a fucking idiot now for falling for the same thing twice! Hint: it isn't me hahaha. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:05:21
Stop asking the same question every 10 minutes you idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:46:57
I thought everyone knew not to use existing sentences. 
A brainwallet is created simply by starting with a unique phrase. The phrase must be sufficiently long to prevent brute-force guessing - a short password, a simple phrase, or a phrase taken from published literature is likely to be stolen by hackers who use computers to quickly try combinations. A suggestion is to take a memorable phrase and change it in a silly way that is difficult to predict.
Yet you thought you were smarter than the system. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:10:43
Stop these fucking posts you goddamn fucking morons! We get it...We got it after the first 20 times it was posted. Just piss off! Annoying the fuck out of people here with these non stop posts won't magically bring your coins back.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:26:15
Don't be a fucking idiot. Look, you can be a Bitcoin supporter and not live in fantasy land. Something you obviously do when i look at your posts. 
You are very young i take it? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:53:58
It's called panic selling. I take it you must be new to this whole Bitcoin thing?
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:28:49
Why don't you answer my question?
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:43:30
Use the fucking search! Fuck this is getting ridiculous! It's the same fucking questions every fucking hour of the day! Why do you idiots REFUSE to use the search! Why!!
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:33:22
Congrats you fucking idiot! Your about the 20th person today and the 150th this week to ask this question. 
Whatever you do make sure not to use the search and instead repeat the same shit over and over again. Annoying prick!
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:39:58
Thanks for post 35 on this. When will you people ever learn how to use the goddamn search!
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:53:06
Great. Now before 20 idiots will scream and yell ZOOOMGG 400!!!1! we get threads how we are gonna reach 400. 
This place gets better by the day. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:56:45
Stop these fucking posts already! Goddamn idiots! Every 15 minutes the same fucking question!
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:51:50
God, this fucking idiot kid again. Just can't stay away from this place. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:45:04
Look to your right in the sidebar! It's all there!
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:54:36
Yes you are an idiot indeed. Stop the fucking reposts! How fucking hard can it be to not repost something!
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:59:44
This is a troll right? I mean nobody would be this clueless right?
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:05:11
You could have started by looking to you right and read the link that says "Getting Started".
Or you could've used the search and read through the 153 similar topics in the last 2 months.
But i guess that would take time and energy. Why do the work yourself when others can do it for you right?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:56:10
This is asked 20 fucking times a day! Fucking stop it already you morons! What the fuck you idiots think? That we can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:47:56
Fucking hell! Stop these fucking posts! It's getting completely retarded! Just stop fucking using them. 
In the meantime someone please start a Coinbase subreddit. So we don't have to see 20 of the same posts every fucking day!
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:41:43
Why do you REFUSE to do a search? Instead you ask the same question that has been asked and answered so goddamn many times! 
Why the hell do you think that search to your right is there? What's its purpose you think? Take a guess. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:54:56
Thanks for the 20th post about this. We don't have any charts on our computers. So thanks for the update 10 minutes after the fact. 
Annoying idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:57:42
Stop these fucking posts you annoying idiots! You had 150 warnings. You ignored it and now come crying here because they screwed you over as well. It's the same story 30 times a day. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:53:38
Yes we know you fucking idiot! It's been posted 20 times already!
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:59:32
Make sure to not use the search and find 50 threads that answer your question. That would be stupid. Instead start a new thread with the same question. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:53:59
He won't. He did the same thing in his Ebay post and then dissapeared. Just like he will do this time. 
And the next time. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:40:37
These to the moon posts are getting so sooo annoying. It's such childish behavior. Just piss off you dumb kid. 
It was fun 300 posts before. Not anymore
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:50:06
No, you idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:38:37
Great fucking post! No really, awesome post. Highly original as well. And these deep thoughts man! We need more posts like this here. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:36:18
These threads have to stop!
Just stop fucking using them! This is so retarded. You idiots see the 20 posts a day about them yet still you use them and then come crying here when they fuck up. How fucking dumb can you get!
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:10:55
Let me guess. You are a drug addict?
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:48:42
Already posted about 15 times. A fucking day ago! Stop the fucking reposts you fucking morons! How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:46:07
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:57:35
Stop the goddamn reposts! What the hell is wrong with you people!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:28:35
The person who came up with the sentence "Bitcoin user not affected" should be shot. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:07:35
Piss off with your "PSA". Nobody cares what you think. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:53:11
Get a job man. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:23:54
Piss off moron!
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:58:11
What facts you goddamn fucking retard? Where do i post all these facts? Can you back up this claim?
And talking about not backing up facts maybe you want want to re-read the 1 word gem i just responded to. 
Yup, the irony is thick in this one. 
Once again, you are really young aren't you?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:58:46
Please. For the love of God, stop it. Just stop making these threads! Please! There are 100 similar threads. We don't need another. Just stop using them. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:37:09
Stop it with these fucking posts! For the love of God! Stop it!
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:02:12
People STILL waste their money on these things?
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:10:07
Stop the fucking reposts you goddamn moron!
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:00:43
Haha this comment:
Bitcoin is pointless now since it takes over a year to mine a single coin on a regular computer.
Yeak ok. I'll delete my wallet then. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:24:43
We know! It's been posted fucking 15 times already! How fucking hard is it to not repost something?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:02:07
This image was funny the first time it was posted 5 months ago. Now 5 months and 200 posts later it's getting slightly annoying. Oh no wait, very fucking annoying. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:49:02
Stop the fucking reposts you goddamn idiots! Just stop fucking doing it! How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:43:54
The same story. So you read the other stories and still sent your money there. That makes you an idiot. And because you are the 150th person to post this in the last 3 days it also makes you an annoying prick!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:02:58
Make sure you don't click "getting started" in the sidebar and find all the answers to your question. Instead start yet another thread to annoy everyone here with the same old questions that have been answered 100 times before. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:01:23
With 50 customers it's completely normal that noone paid with Bitcoin. You'd need at least 100's or maybe 1000's of customers to start seeing regular Bitcoin payments. 
Nowhere near 1 in 50 people own and buy stuff with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:20:36
Well you idiot, you are being downvoted because this subreddit was completely filled with this news about a week ago. And the crying about downvotes only makes it worse. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:41:58
People are idiots for panic selling. Everybody gets what he deserves. I don't feel sorry for anyone. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:09:06
Stop these fucking posts you fucking morons! We get it. After 150 similar posts. 
You are an idiot if you use Coinbase. Stop fucking crying. It's your own fault!
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:04:43
Stop the fucking reposts man! Just stop it!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:30:56
It was a troll you fucking idiot! My god, you people are dumb!
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:32:34
Why don't you use the fucking search next time? What you think it's doing there to your right?
This his been asked about 200 times already. 
I just can not understand why you idiots think anybody here can look into the future 
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:17:02
Stop making these threads every 15 minutes you goddamn morons!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:59:40
Oh yeah, that completely changes everything. 
My god...
Oh and nobody knows if it will hit 1000 soon you tool!
Edit: he quickly edited his post after i posted mine adding "is expected". 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:10:45
Stop fucking making these posts you fucking idiots. There are like 30 posts a day now. All with the same cry story. 
It's your own fucking fault. You don't see me crying about them here. You know why? I don't send them my money because i'm not stupid. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:16:57
You got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:03:59
Yeah of course you fucking retard. The 30 threads a day are all 1 guy making up shit. 
You are obviously connected to them and try to do damage control. Believe me your trolling is so obvious and fake that you only make things worse. You dumb fuck!
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:10:46
Fuck, do we really need 10 fucking threads a day like this? It's been asked and discussed hundreds of time! Just stop it already! Especially since noone can answer it! Annoying shit!
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:33:48
Can you idiots stop making these worthless threads every single day?
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:41:09
Reality hurt doesn't it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:59:43
Congrats you idiot! You are the 150th person this week to ask this question!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:18:09
Can you idiots stop polluting this place with this shit all day long?
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:02:25
Thanks. It's only been posted 20 times already. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:41:18
Stop the fucking reposts you goddamn fuckings idiots! How fucking hard can it be not to post thevsame thing 10 times?? Really, how hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:24:10
Please don't start a thread in a few days from now how they screwed you over. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:40:59
Why do you even bother to type this all out. 200 people before you have done the same thing. You're just annoying everyone here by starting yet another post about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:43:57
Thanks for explaining this. We almost missed the 250 posts about it in the last 7 days. 
This is exactly what we needed. Another one. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:12:12
Great, thread  with the same question. The question that can't be answered. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:30:01
They should make this place 21+
All these dumbass kids with their OOOOOMMG!!!1! 700!!! and to the moon posts are so fucking goddamn annoying!
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:56:44
Stop these fucking threads you fucking morons! The amount of people here who think we can look into the future scares me. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:20:08
You just prefer to be an annoying prick. Got it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:50:20
Yes, we ALL are seeing it on our screens. No need to update us here. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:08:52
Yes we know you fucking idiot! It's been posted every fucking 15 minutes. Are you fucking blind or what!
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:46:27
Next week you'll be crying here how Coinbase fucked up. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:59:15
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:59:26
Stop the fucking reposts you idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:30:02
Here is some advice for you. Use the fucking search! 
This place is getting totally retarded. 
90% of the posts here are just the same fucking question over and over again. 
Why do you people REFUSE to use the search!
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:39:00
Yes we know. It's been posted many times already a week ago. How can it be so fucking hard not to repost something? Explain that to me because i fail to understand it!
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:19:40
You have to be kidding me!
They are pretty close to what i would call scammers. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:55:00
You think wrong. I'm not even sure how you came to that conclusion. You must be pretty ignorant. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:25:19
Yeah i'm just slave man. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:28:03
Thanks for starting the 5th topic about this. Exactly what this place needs. More reposts. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:54:48
Can't the mods do something about these posts? Put some text in the post field like some other sub reddits. This shit has to stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:10:45
Why do people still buy these things? I don't get it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:22:15
42? You sure you aren't 16? You sure behave that way. 
Also hard to believe someone your age types the way you do. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:53:22
I expected that wall to dissapear in 5 minutes. For some reason it's stopping everything. Very odd. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:30:59
This has been asked about 150 times in the last week and it's getting annoying as fuck. Especially since obviously nobody here can look into the future!
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:09:44
Yup, that must be the best way. Once you spent 100 dollars 100 people have heard of it. I really can't think of a better way. Pure genius!
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:40:16
Please don't start a thread in a few days how Coinbase screwed you over. Really, just don't. 
Oh and nobody is gonna send you coins for Paypal. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:08:10
Well done idiot. You made another thread with the same question that is asked 30 times a day. 
Whatever you do DO NOT use the search. Instead start the same thread that is started every 30 minutes to annoy the fuck out of everyone. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:38:42
Fucking hell man! Do we really need these posts 10 fucking times a day! Fucking stop it already you fucking annoying pricks!
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:36:30
You are a fucking idiot and deserved what you got. I would've told you to go fuck yourself as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:55:28
Just throw some Bitcoins at it and everything will be fine. I heard it also can cure aids. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:16:10
Yes of course. Stupid question. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:42:42
The next kid who posts a to the moon post should be shot ij the knees. 
How fucking annoying can you get. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:43:49
People are idiots. You can say don't panic all you want but after 1 big whale sale tons of people will instantly panic and sell and eventually buy back with a big loss. It's always the same. People never learn. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:35:00
Stop these fucking posts man! There have been 200 warnings a out using these scumbags here. In the last week alone. If you still use them you're a total fucking idiot. 
Now stop posting the same shit over and over again. We get it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:23:13
What the hell makes you think that anybody here can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:17:11
Stop the goddam reposts! How hard can it be to not repost something!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:19:34
No, you should stop using them so these 50 posts a day about them can stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:51:19
Jesus! Use the goddamn search you fucking morons! This has been asked and answered at least 100 times! Why do you idiots REFUSE to use the search??
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:24:30
Use the fucking search! I'm so fucking tired of these posts fucking 20 times a day!
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:03:43
Yes of course it is. The same news that has been posted 15 times. 
But the topic starter didn't know so instead of doing a search he said fuck it i'm gonna post it anyway. Who cares that this place is 90% filled with reposts. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:31:00
Uh no thanks. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 02:01:12
You seem to think blackmailing people is a normal thing to do. 
I take it you do this in real life as well?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:49:12
Use the fucking search! It's been answered 100 times already! What the fuck is wrong with you people!
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:39:54
Haha what an idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:15:44
Use the goddamn search you prick!
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:18:41
Yes. They woke up. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:17:58
The last time someone asked this was 15 mins ago and before that 30 minutes. It gets asked at least 30 times a day!
And it's annoying ask fuck! Just fucking stop it already!
The worst part is that all you idiots think there are people here who can look into the future!
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:24:49
So you used dollars to buy bitcoins to buy a walmart card to buy a steam card to buy a game?
Were you dropped on your head as a child?
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:11:02
I wonder who the fuck you are! You're in every Coinbase thread defending those scumbags acting like they're God's gift to earth. 
They either pay you or you are one of the owners. 
You're clearly not a random Coinbase client. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:09:13
You mean the guy who called you a pathetic troll in your Ebay post? Well, i really wonder why you don't like him. 
You just confirmed what was 100% clear already. You're the same moron kid. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:19:46
Yes i have a suggestion. FFS stop these fucking posts you goddam fucking annoying idiots! Can't you see this very question is asked fucking THIRTY TIMES a day!
What makes it even worse is that nobody on this planet can fucking answer it! What makes you think that anybody here can look into the future!
Seriously, the next person who asks this question (in 15 mins from now) should be shot in the knees!
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:41:55
Cool man, only 15 people before you posted this in the last few days!
This place needs more of these posts! 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:57:49
Please, start some more threads about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:37:14
Use the fucking search man. It's been answered many times. The last time 10 minutes ago!
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:23:27
Yes we know goddamn moron! It's posted 5 times in the last hour and 35 times in the last 3 days! Next do a fucking search before posting so you do not look like an annoying idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:19:45
Nah, i don't help people who think they are more important than others. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 10:19:31
Yeah and the 20 other people every day are asking the same question. It's answered so goddamn many times already! 
It's annoying as fuck! You could simply do a search but for some reason you people refuse to to use it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:52:41
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 15 times already!
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:50:42
Man there are at least 100 topics with the same question. Instead of polluting this place with yet another repost you could've done a search.
It's just fucking annoying to see the same thing posted every 15 minutes!
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:27:02
Are you drunk?
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:17:18
Yes we know you fucking idiot! It's been posted 10 times already! Just stop with the reposts! How fucking hard can it be?
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:26:54
Stop the fucking reposts already you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:43:55
Thanks for posting it again. In case we missed the thirty other posts. 
Just keep in mind to never use the search and just repost old news over and over again. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:11:04
Very smart of him. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:43:03
I don't understand these things. People like you are willing to do stupid stuff for 10 cents per hour but refuse to get a normal job. Why?
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:46:33
Or you get a real job and stop wasting your time for pennies.
I never understand these things.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:27:53
Stop it already you fucking annoying idiots! 1 thread about it is enough! Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:54:56
Do a fucking search man! This has been asked an insane amount of times. Why do you people REFUSE to use the fucking search!
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:11:27
Please don't.
There are 10 threads a day about them already. It's just annoying and won't solve anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:55:52
See you next week when you start a thread crying how you lost your money. Believe me, don't even bother, nobody will feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:48:32
So now we're getting posts here telling us to look at a chart? This place is getting more retarded by the day. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:47:08
Yeah, that made me cringe so hard. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:05:36
Already posted you dumb fuck! As 9 out of 10 of all your posts are. 
You're like the village idiot of this subreddit. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:50:58
And he's gone. Surprise suprise. 
I hope you morons realize how fucking dumb you look right now. 
Not that it matters because you will believe him when he pulls his next troll. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:55:08
You're joking right?
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:59:09
Yes we know. It was clear by the 300 posts in the last few weeks. But thanks for starting another one. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:41:37
Cool man, you started the 10th bitcoin at 666 thread. This place needs more awesome posts like this. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:11:13
People posting that completely useless graph and then telling us where we are should be shot.
It's just so fucking retarded. It's been posted 100's of times and everybody adds a different "we are here". 
Usually just dumb fucking clueless kids with 2 coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:21:45
It's your own fault. This place is FILLED with Coinbase stories like this. Every single day! 
You still used these idiots and now you are one of those people crying on Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:20:53
Yes! I have advice for you. Stop using them! 
This is getting stupid. 20 threads a day about problems with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:26:43
Look to your right. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:44:51
Stop the fucking reposts you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:55:03
Fucking hell! Use the fucking search man. It's been discussed a million times. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:16:49
Stop acting like this is a fact. 
It drives me nuts to see all you kids with no clue whatsoever about economics post shit like this all day long. Like you all got it figured out and there are no other options. The way you people think is so extremely simple that it scares me. 
I sure hope Bitcoin will get huge but i prefer not to live in fantasy land. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:59:36
Yes after up to 30 posts a day about them we got the message. But thanks for starting yet another one. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:22:57
You are thanking them for fixing a ridiculous problem? Like they did something extremely fucking extra special for you? This is worth a post? Really?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:39:43
Stop recommending them to new people. If he uses them he will be crying here in a few days how they screwed them over. Just what we need after 200 similar posts in the past week. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:01:07
Whatever you do make sure to not use the search and find out this has been asked and answered about 80 times already. Instead start a new thread with the same question. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:47:29
I don't think you seem to realize how big the US debt. This post is kinda funny. 
Even at 1000 dollars a coin selling the coins they own wouldn't have any
impact whatsoever. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 02:55:30
Why the hell does this get downvoted?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:11:01
Are you also new to using the fucking search?
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:32:19
Yes we know you idiot! It's been posted 30 times in the last few days. How fucking hard is it to not repost something! Explain that to me because i completely fail to understand it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:29:26
Nobody knows you fucking idiot! This is asked every fucking 10 minutes! What makes you think anybody here can look into the future? Please explain it to me because these posts keep amazing me. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:19:21
Yes we know you fucking idiot. It's been posted 10 times already.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:23:23
How about clicking the link called "getting started" on your right? I know it sounds crazy but just try it. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:12:25
You have to be fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:18:58
Basically you want a Bitcoin to magically appear in your wallet, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:27:24
Nobody knows you fucking idiot. Not now and not in the 300 previous posts with the same question. You know why? Because nobody can look into the future!
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:41:47
By using the fucking search! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:22:23
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:05:11
Silly kid. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:41:54
Yes we know. You are also an idiot for using them. Unless you don't consider 300 warnings enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:14:16
These questions are asked about 5 times a day. Which is annoying as fuck. Especially since nobody can answer this. 
Seriously how can you even ask this? What makes you think that anybody on this planet would know what Bitcoin will do next?
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:44:15
It isn't down. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:11:00
Man, look to your right. It's all there in the fucking sidebar. 
And if you still need more info then you can do a search. You'll see that this question is asked about 5 times a day. Every single day. 
I wish someone would explain to me why you people REFUSE to use the search. I just don't get it!
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:36:44
This has been asked so goddamn many times!
Why do you think that thing called a search is doing there on the right. Take a guess. Think about it, real hard!
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:26:39
Someone who makes a post like he did either is very young or has an extremely low IQ. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:57:29
This place is full of young, broke people who own a coin or 2 and want to become rich while sleeping. 
They have no clue about economics etc. In their mind it's very simple: bitcoin will get huge and i'm gonna be a millionaire. Anything else they reject. 
Funny enough you rarely see the people with a lot of guys *edit* COINS damnit not guys! act like this. They don't tend to live in a fantasy land. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:37:44
Yes we know! It's been posted 10 times already!
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:17:01
These threads are getting annoying. Just stop fucking using them. They are cleary idiots. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:42:36
What part about it was a troll don't you understand exactly?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:36:59
Oh look another one of their paid trolls. Either the third i've seen or just the same person under a different nick. 
You just know what kind of company your dealing with once they start doing stuff like this. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:57:28
No nobody, only the about 150 people (yes i'm serious) who posted the same thing. But hey whatever you do do not use the search function. Instead just start the same thread. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:56:19
Ah capslock. Your topic is obviously more important than the other topics. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:13:45
Great, a week after we had 100 atm posts we just start over again. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:19:16
Stop these fucking posts! Holy shit! This is completely insane! It's the same unanswerable question every fucking 15 minutes now! Fucking morons!
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:05:40
Sure. Just don't come crying here after they screwed you over. After 300 posts i think it's been enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:16:31
There are 100's of posts and links about this. How long did you search?
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:39:30
Yes we know. We all can see it on the charts on our screens. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:29:56
Ffs stop these fucking posts! Jesus!
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:20:07
Yes. Here is an idea. Use the fucking search! You know why it's there? To prevent people like you from asking this for the 70th time!
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:58:48
Wow, thanks for explaining this! We were totally unaware of this fact! 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:49:48
Here's my opinion: stop the fucking reposts! Just stop it!
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:09:40
Nobody here can look into the future! Not even a little bit! I know, that's very hard to believe right!
Oh and fuck you for asking the same question that has been asked 200 times already. Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:54:24
I don't think you understand the article. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:15:38
Don't be such a fucking idiot man! He pulled EXACTLY the same thing before. He hardly even changed the words! 
It's some broke ass kid who owns a few coins and is shitting his pants because of tonights crash. 
How goddamn fucking dumb do you have to be to fall for this shit! Twice!
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:48:54
The search doesn't work with that reader? google doesn't work either?
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:37:02
"Thank you for your reply, I appreciate your help. I will use the search next time, I didn't even know Reddit had one. Still lots to learn on here!"
Obviously it was needed. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:16:31
Yes we know you fucking moron! Because it's been posted 30 times in the last 3 days! When will you annoying idiots learn how to use the fucking search before posting!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:09:52
The search and links in the sidebar will answer all your questions!
Do your own research like we all did instead of asking the same old questions for the 100th time. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:08:52
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 20 times already. Why is it so extremely hard for you people not to repost anything? Can you explain that to me?
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:45:13
Yes we know you fucking retard! Because this 3 days old news has been posted about 30 times already!
What the fuck is wrong with you idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:36:31
Work on your grammar instead. How can anyone write like this and not feel like an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:39:50
What kind of answer do you expect exactly?
I don't understand these questions...it's such a waste of bandwidth.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:45:38
Yes we know you annoying idiot! We all have charts. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:43:36
Yeah that's what you get for being an annoying prick. In every community. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:26:11
How the hell does it matter to her if the price goes up and down. She simply gets the money she sells her product for. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:06:25
Yes it's horrible.
Totally unusable as a fast payment option.
But for some reason everyone just ignores it. Its main reason to use it is fucked and nobody gives a shit.
In the meantime people keep advertising it everywhere as the perfect payment option.
Yeah, how perfect...6 hours for a transaction.
Anyway, bring on the downvotes because obviously i'm not allowed to say this.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:43:46
Yes we know! It's already been posted!
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:37:22
Yes i read that and you didn't make it clear if your claim was real or not. 
So anyway, i was right it seems. You're just some dumbass kd. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:18:09
Congrats. The most retarded "article" i've read here all week. 
I can't believe there are idiots out there who think Bitcoin belongs to Americans. Wtf?
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:42:49
Stop the goddamn reposts you idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:56:41
People are STILL upvoting this troll? What the hell is wrong with you people! How many times does he have to pull EXACTLY the same thing before you realize he's trolling you?

Stop fucking asking this every single day you annoying idiots! Use the goddamn search!
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:26:44
How classy of you. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:26:52
Yes you stupid fuck! Just like the 30 people before you posted in the last 3 days, they are CLOSING!!!11ZOMG
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:13:32
Thanks. We don't have charts so we didn't notice. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:25:56
Bitcoin isn't made just to give you a profit. Nothing guarantees it and nobody owes you that. 
It's money. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:17:31
Yes we know! Because it's been posted about 15 times already you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:15:38
Yes we know you fucking retard! It's been posted 5 times already! How fucking hard can it be to not repost something?
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:27:37
They have been saying this for 2 months. You must be new here. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:47:01
Yes we can see that you fucking moron! We have internet access! 
Fucking annoying kids in this place!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:31:54
They will cancel your transaction for high risk. And you will be crying about them here. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:40:41
Highly unlikely that someone with 25k coins doesn't use back ups. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:12:43
Yeah, i'm gonna pay you to advertise your site. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:59:41
Uh wow. Lunch break in the loony bin?
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:32:52
Great, next week you'll start a thread how you have a problem and your money is gone and that they don't respond. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:38:36
Stop these fucking coinbase posts. It's getting completely stupid! Just stop using them already!
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:36:55
My opinion is that the next person who starts a thread like this should be shot. 
I think after 250 of them it's been enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:45:34
Stop fucking crying! The 100 people with the same cry story before you should've been a sign. Don't you think? You still send your money there. So that makes you an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:34:53
Stop the fucking reposts you idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:03:04
Discussed a 1000 times already man. Do you really you think you're the first to come up with this? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:05:31
Discussed about a 100 times before. But no matter what just don't use the search and start a new topic instead!
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:46:49
That's how they like it here. And if you say something about it you get downvoted. Reality is a big no no here.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:01:09
A day ago?
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:10:20
These things are discussed in tons of threads here and on the forums. For the last 6 months. Was it really needed to start yet a new thread? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:37:21
They don't get upvoted because everyone is sick and tired of them!
Just today:
Believe me, we don't want to see them anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:17:15
These posts have to stop indeed. Every time it hits a certain point 20 16 year olds posts the same ZOOOMG 600 DOLLAR!!!1 
It's so annoying and childish.
Not only that, we also all have the charts open on our screen. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:55:19
Stop asking the same thing 30 times a day you morons! Nobody here can look into the future!
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:26:24
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:46:20
So how many days did you spend on getting a few cents instead of getting a job? Sorry, you're an idiot and i don't feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:54:12
You annoying idiot! This has been asked 20 times today 150 times this week. Just fucking stop it already! Nobody here can look into the future
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:29:16
Wtf? We know also get updates for small buys?
Just piss off with this shit! We all have these charts open on our screen. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:27:24
Stop it with these fucking posts man. 20 times a day we have to read the same shit. Every single day!
You are an idiot if you send your money there. 150 warnings weren't enough for you?
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:00:59
Stop fucking asking this 20 times a day you goddamn retarded morons! Fuck! This is totally crazy!
Even more so because nobody can answer this. 
Why the fuck are there 2 dozen people a day here who think we can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:48:49
Inside the box. Haha right kiddo. 
Seriously what the fuck else do you expect someone to think when he reads that nonsense?
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:54:10
The INSANE amounts of reposts. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:43:16
A 2 second search would show you 100 topics that tell you you won't make profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:40:54
Yes, just like it's been explained to the 200 people with the same post before you. 
Just make sure to not use the search and instead ask the same question again. Annoying prick!
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:49:16
Piss off fucking idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:02:26
Just fuck off man! Stop fucking asking this question every 30 minutes you annoying idiots!
This had been fucking asked about 150 times in the last few days! Stop it!
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:10:00
Fucking hell man! 3 days old news and you seriously think you are the first to post this? What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?
Stop the goddamn reposts you fucking retards!
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:31:40
It is not very certain you idiot! It is a possibility and nothing more. 
The only reason it's very certain in your mind is because you own 2 coins. 
That's about as far as most people can think here. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:58:08
Stop it already you fucking moron!
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:30:38
Blah blah blah. The same shit that's posted 10 times a day. Every day. Only an idiot would still send his money there. How much more fucking warnings did you need. It's your own fault. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:04:42
The next person who makes one of these retarded to the moon posts should be punched in the face! Annoying fucking kids!
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:28:42
Stop posting this every 30 minutes you fucking retards!
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:51:51
Because people are idiots and panic sell like the dumb sheep they are. That's all really. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:41:11
It's all been asked and answered 100's of times already. That's why there is a sidebar with info. Stop the fucking 20 similar posts a day about it!
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:34:08
Use the goddamn search man! There are 1000 topics about this. Why do you people REFUSE to use the search and insteas ask the same stuff over and over and over again?
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:42:46
Use the goddamn search! This is asked and answered 20 times a day!
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:06:50
Can we make this place 21+ please so these kinda posts hopefully stop?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:54:59
What kind of college do you go to that you think people here can look into the future. Are you "special"?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:01:55
Man, this is asked and answered 10 times a day. Use the goddamn search!
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:50:01
Stop fucking crying you fucking idiot. There are 200 threads about this. They don't give a shit and you are a moron for using them. Now piss off!
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:23:51
You're a fucking idiot for using them and an annoying prick for starting the same thread about them as the 200 other people before you.  
Why are people still using them! How much more warnings do you morons need!
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:59:37
Fucking hell. These Coinbase posts are getting completely ridiculous. Soon this page will be 90% filled with posts about Coinbase. 
Just fucking stop using these idiots already!
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:32:00
More like the 10th time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:34:08
Why do you people REFUSE to use the search and instead ask the same question about every 30 mins. Why?!
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:36:55
Only an idiot would use Coinbase in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:00:31
Get a fucking job. I just got sick reading your post. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:56:54
If they dump it at once we're fucked. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:26:36
Stop answering these people! It's been asked and answered at least 50 times! Let them use the search!
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:28:43
Silly kid. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:11:32
Thanks for starting this thread. This has only been discussed about 78 times before. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:25:11
Look to your right.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:01:19
Thanks for being the third person to post it. 
Fucking annoying idiots. 
Dumb fucking kids with your annoying drawings. This place should be 21+
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:37:56
Please stop these posts already! It's highly annoying!
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:34:53
You are a druggie aren't you?
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:46:51
Use the goddamn search man! It's been asked and answered so fucking many times!
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:02:02
You missed the 300 posts with the same story before you?
I wish people would just stop using them and stop flooding this subreddit with the same story 20 times a day. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:31:06
Yeah i said fuck. Fuck all these morons who are gonna post about it on Reddit like 15 year old kids with adhd. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:11:13
Piss off please. Go search one the 1000 other posts with the same question.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:00:06
They are all copied and pasted man. Do we really need to post the same news several times because they are on a different url?
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:24:45
Fucking hell man! Ffs stop these threads! We get it! 30 threads a day about the same fucking subject! Every single day! We get it!
Anybody who still uses them is an complete fucking idiot!
Now stop it with these fucking posts!
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:18:40
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:30:30
Do a fucking search you annoying idiot! It's asked 20 times a day!
Why the fuck do you think the search button exists?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:58:48
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 10 times already. What makes you possibly think you are the first to post this!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:25:37
Obviously the same fucking troll as the Ebay "employee" and you fucking idiots fall for it again. Unbefuckinglievable! What a dumb bunch of idiots you people are. 
Some 16 year old kid with 3 coins is trolling the shit out of you and it works. Every single time. 
Edit: he has EXACTLY the same MO as in his Ebay post. He's not even trying because he knows you retards will fall for it anyway. I'm not sure if this is hilarious or beyond pathetic. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:28:18
Yes we know. There are 10 topics a day about it. Just stop fucking using these idiots so we can stop seeing these threads. 
They are becoming the new MtGox. A bunch of clueless amateurs you need to stay away from. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:22:19
How can it be so fucking extremely hard to not repost shit all day?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:54:11
That's what you get for using them. After 200 warnings i don't feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:35:53
Ouch, sucks to be him. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:11:35
No, it MIGHT. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:39:08
Obviously not good enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:52:13
I can't feel sorry for you. 
This place is full of posts about how much they suck every single day. And everybody knows they don't respond to emails. Yet they keep doing business with them, run into problems and then come crying here. 
Blame yourself. 
I know i won't ever send those idiots a penny of my money. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:08:02
If you want more information then why do you refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:57:41
Yes we can see that. We all have internet access to the charts. 
They should start banning people for these kind of posts. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:05:59
I'm sure that will change their mind. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:07:39
The basics are to fucking read or search! For people like you they made it as easy as possible by providing links in the sidebar. And also a search which will show you that this is asked and answered about 5 times a day. Every single day!
