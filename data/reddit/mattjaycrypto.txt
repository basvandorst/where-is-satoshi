Spoiler Alert: The books lead character "Roger V" turns out to be a full blown finger sniffer.

Lol..... I've grown so disenchanted that I simply start ragging on it myself now.

BTC is BS
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:40:01
I'll give you a one-time redo if you'd like to take your time and come up with a big boy rip instead of that nonsense. Face it dog.....BTC is played out and will ultimately wither up and die a long slow death over the next 5 to 10 years.

A guy who works in our IT department's brother claims to have heard it while out snowboarding with satoshi's gardeners buddy earlier today. It's pretty Rock Solid info bro.

Fantastic!!! John Perry Barlow would be very pleased with the cyber frontierism going on here.

Nice plan! Very very nice!

Ya think?????? Maybe you could also give us a hard-hitting expose on how Bitconnect might actually be a scam.

Your Dick is an embarrassment.....just like Don Trump and his tiny hands.

I guess that Rogers biggest fear would be going back to prison....... and quite frankly who can blame him..... as it's widely known that prisoners occasionally get butt raped during their incarceration.

The laughable disintegration of Team B-Cash has undoubtably been one of the very few highlights of 2018!

Needs 2, 5 and 50
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:22:22
Bravo. This one actually restored a dash of faith for me. The kindness of man seldom gets the spotlight these days, very cool on all accounts!
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:59:01
Some blame Trump for others its a weakend gene pool thing. I suspect a classic trickle down effect at play.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:31:01
It's absolutely hilarious to me that the BeeCash diehards are typically the same knobs who ride or die with VEN and TRX.
