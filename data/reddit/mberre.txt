Subject to our sub's Rule III ban on editorizalized/sensationalized titles, we mods would not remove it. 
If our spam filter catches it, you can clear that up by contacting the mods.

ABSTRACT: 
We analyze how network effects affect competition in the nascent cryptocurrency market. We do so by examining the changes over time in exchange rate data among cryptocurrencies. Specifically, we look at two aspects: (1) competition among different currencies, and (2) competition among exchanges where those currencies are traded. Our data suggest that the winner-take-all effect is dominant early in the market. During this period, when Bitcoin becomes more valuable against the U.S. dollar, it also becomes more valuable against other cryptocurrencies. This trend is reversed in the later period. The data in the later period are consistent with the use of cryptocurrencies as financial assets (popularized by Bitcoin), and not consistent with “winner-take-all” dynamics. For exchanges, we find little if any evidence of arbitrage opportunities. With no arbitrage opportunities, it is possible for multiple exchanges to coexist in equilibrium despite two-sided network effects.

Hi,  mod here,
No hell hasn't frozen over. As far as we mods can see,  there is [no real consensus about BTC]( in either one direction or the other in our sub.
Our sub is dedicated to research and news about econ. While we have seen SOME amount of news and research about about the underlying econ which is relevant to BTC,  it isn't something one comes across everyday (unlike say.... the latest unemployment figures). 
That might explain why it occurs so rarely that BTC gets any mention in Nevertheless, our sub's hivemind is broadly neutral on this matter with no strong sentiment either in favor or against.

Mate, did you read the paper?
You do realize that what they mean is that DIFFERENT CRYPTO-CURRENCIES are going to be competing eachother. right?
Moreover, I have to point out that it says nothing about gvs trying to compete, an that the words "equador [sic]" and "Mintchip" aren't even mentioned in this piece. 
Also...you'll pass on what? On being interested in the potential future of a competitive marketplace for cyrptocurrencies? You came to because you **ARE NOT** interested in the potential marketplace of cyrptocurrencies?

I fail to see the lol in this.  
[Coinmarketcap]( indicates a combined marketcap for all the top 100 currencies listed at about $8.2 Bil, 92.6% of which, is held by the top currency (not exactly what you'd call a large or competitive marketplace yet). 
I think it's safe to say that the Canadians envision a larger figure with more pronounced diversification than that in the future. It's seems a fairly uncontroversial prediction.

That claim is questionable.
I'm not entirely sure how much the National Bureau of Economic Research is invested in the current economic system. They exist in order to organize academic research, and generally to ponder the main academic econ questions of our time. I don't imagine them intrinsically having a stake in this argument one way or the other, 
As for the author, he's a professor at NYU, and he probably only cares that he publishes SOMETHING, and that others in academia read it, and  the cite his research (which happens when said peers either like it, or hate it....doesn't matter, just as long as people are actually finding it somewhat relevant).

Or that it's a theoretically efficient marketplace, according to standard economic theory for financial assets (EMH, CAPM). 
In any case, I'm pretty sure that they mean BETWEEN &amp; AMONG the various Cryptocurrencies, so, I don't really see what you mean. 
 
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:02:56
Not sure which THEM you are referring to. The Canadians? I don't think they are specifically asking for anybody to trust them.
Basically what the BOC is saying is "Sure.... BTC may be all the rage today, but sooner or later, we're going to see the emergence of a full competitive marketplace for this sort of thing". 
I thought it would make nice content for this sub.

digital currencies is the ‘distributed ledger’ which allows a
payment system to operate in an entirely decentralised
way, without intermediaries such as banks. 
I like where this is going. I also like that the article take a sort of balanced look, and also considers the potential risks. If I'm not mistaken, this is only the 3rd time that this matter has been written about by the CBs at all, but so far, this is the most interesting read of the three.

Bitcoin will wipe them out?

**Eurozone-based Economist here,**
Let me see if I can field some of your questions.
-  **I was thinking that if Bitcoin became widely adopted (and by widely, I mean the dominant currency) wouldn't countries loose the ability to utilize monetary policy to guide their own economies?**
Not entirely. Only some of the monetary channels would be hampered. The bank lending channel would still be viable, and probably come to dominate other monetary policy tools.
Another CB policy tool we'd likely see the rise of would be macroprudential policy, (as we're already seeing since 2009). In sense of **MV=PY**, the main idea would be to influence PY by means of V rather than by means of M. 
Also, looking at asian markets, where CB strategic credit policy is still rather popular, I can see credit policy becoming more of a fiscal policy issue  rather than a monetary policy one (like in the west). 
- **Even more, if the several countries all used Bitcoin, wouldn't that force them them to suffer economic consequences from weaker nations.**
Looking at how contagion works, I'd say that the opposite scenario is more likely. Which is to say that the main risk is that things going wrong in LARGE countries (like Germany) have the potential to cause knock-on effects in smaller trading partners (like Holland, Belgium, Denmark, etc), and that these spillover risks might be somewhat more complex to mitigate with fewer monetary tools being viable. 
IMO, the eurozone crisis isn't about Greece as much as it's about the way that the greek situation is being handled by the European institutions at large. Its about what the ECB, EBRD, EFSF and ESM have and haven't done. 
Under an economic system where BTC is the main currency, such an episode would likely see a drying-up of cross-border credit and trade coming from the problem country, and this might cause traditional forms of currency to become relatively more important (in the neighbor countries) for as long as the recession lasts in the problem country. If the problem country is the size of Germany or Italy, the effect is likely to be larger than if the problem country is the size of Iceland or Cyprus. 
Although, I'm presuming that LOLR would still be a thing, so some mitigation would still be possible

obviously there are people who are about this issue. 
@_date: 2013-08-10 15:59:20
it isnt that great. It doesnt talk about what went wrong with privately-created money historically. It only talks about what went wrong with state-created money historically...so it's pretty one-sided.
@_date: 2013-08-10 15:58:16
It seems to be missing any analysis about the history of private-created money the economic problems that it caused in its day,, and just exactly why it was outlawed in the US and latin america in the first place.
It's all about "government and money"...there no section about "private sector and money"
@_date: 2013-08-10 16:00:12
that's what they said about paper money 200 years ago....and the 19th century basically proved that it was worth the effort.
