But why do users need to run nodes at all? I think this is the fundamental disagreement.

Extremely simplified explanation: r/bitcoin believes in off-chain scaling (lightning network + sidechains, etc) while r/btc believes in on-chain scaling (bigger blocks)

Just read both and you will see the difference.

These are prints, right? Not real Watches?? Why does the website make it seem like they are real watches?

Coins that were mined in the first few years of Bitcoin, and have never moved.

Why? Seems real to me.

That's a different address brah. This checkpoint dude admits he's wrong: [

Good or Bad depends on which version of Bitcoin you support. I don't know either way, but it will be exciting.

Bitcoin is a Capitalist system. This kind of post just shows how poorly these new investors even understand what they invested in.

That signals the top, not the bottom.

BTC has decided it's an asset class. BCH and BSV have decided it's a currency. This is what the fork was about.

For Brick and Mortar stores Apple and Google Pay may be a hard sell. But for E-commerce it's a no-brainer. Users can literally order products from an online store with a tap on their phone. I work in the e-commerce industry, and I believe Apple and Google payments are going to explode in the near future.

You are talking about brick and mortar retail. I'm talking about e-commerce. Why the heck would you swipe a card when buying online? I think you are way off the mark on this one. Anyone who has run an online store, or has had to make a payment on one, knows that mobile payments are the future.

The Free Open Source Software crowd has co-opted the Bitcoin movement since a couple years ago and want to institute a brand-new, never-before-tested economic system. See: Lightning Network; "Everyone can run their own node"; Transaction Fee Market (whoever came up with this is truly economically challenged); etc.

\*Bitcoin Core\* will never work as a currency.

The Visioning has just happened. What a time to be alive.

Do you run an online store? Have you ever made a payment from your phone? What's easier, tapping a button, or entering all your card and address information every time you order something? The user experience is everything.
Amazon is massively successful in part because of their 1-click ordering system. Apple and Google Pay brings this capability to small businesses. I think you're missing the boat on this one. But time will tell.

I thought they were supposed to turn their machines back on after the difficulty adjusted. This is getting eerie. Where are they? Did Atlas Shrug? Did they all pack up and move to Galt's Gulch? Are they playing Minecraft? 
They haven't switched to BCH or BSV either. 
It's hard to believe multi-million dollar mining concerns would cease all operation after a few weeks of unprofitability. Someone wake up these Chinese guys and tell them the difficulty has been lowered.  
Miners, where are you??
