The description is even better, in that the argument is irrelevant, (and possibly staged by the shows producers) and we're all on the same team.
A mix of both would be best.  Spend SOME od your holdings and increase the utility, which increases value.  Buy back as you can.

Nope, unless they've changed. Takes 3-5 days to get into dwolla (you can start this now) then 6-12 hrs from dwolla-camp.  I've done it twice and the ach was faster 2nd time.

One of two things, the coins will show up, or they won't. 
That's odd that blockchain shows the full address when you omit the last letter, so the system may figure it out, or the transaction will get rejected and come back to him.  Since blockchain shows the address with the L, it looks like the address without the L is not a valid address, my money is on the transaction being rejected and returned to his address.

this is how I see it:
when I had but a few cents, they were mine, my own, my precious.....
but now that I've ~~bought~~ *acquired* more, a few cents here and there are worth spending to help increase adoption.  
Everything I have that's craglist-able, is going on bitmit, at a discount.  As my supply increases, the amount I'm willing to spend increases.
When a tip would be a significant percentage of my total wealth, I'm not going to do it.  But now that it's a fraction of a percent, spend on!  I still don't have much, but by some estimates, I could buy a house in the future.

the consumers pay slightly higher fees for it.  The merchants lose their merchandise.  It's total BS.  In my last venture (3years ago now), I had someone put in a $3000 order online.  My website's fraud-filters flagged it, but Visa OK'd it.  I called my processor to confirm it was OK to run, citing that my filter had flagged it.  They said "no problem, it's good".  So I sent the items, 35 days later, my acct is $3000 negative.  The card was stolen and address changed to an abandoned building BEFORE they used it with me.  So even though Visa fucked up the security and fraud check, told me it was OK, I was the one that ate a $3000 loss.  Visa did NOT pass that cost on to the customer, they left me holding it (and scrambling to pay bills that month...)
FUCK visa.

Don't have it setup automatic yet (unfortunately our web host doesn't integrate, yet).  
At checkout, if you select purchase order and put "bitcoin" in for the PO number I will send you a BitPay payment request.  
This is the initial step to test everything out bank transfers etc..  Not really advertising it yet. 
I'm working on setting up "buy now with BTC" buttons, dynamically generated on each item. The cart and checkout pages aren't configurable enough to fully link to BitPay without the host setting it up.  I've requested integration, if it doesn't happen soon I may switch to a cart that already has integration setup.

Import the private key to another wallet, you should see your balance.  If its there the transaction is in the ether and not been picked up.  Re-send the txn with fee.  if the original gets picked up it'll be rejected as a double-spend attempt.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:39
I think that falls under correlation does not equal causation, no?
I see it as the inverse: 
The dollar's in an inflationary spiral, which tends to kill currency, so the value of BTC is becoming more apparent to a larger spectrum of users, so the exchange rate is rising rapidly.

Yes and no, in my eyes. Bitcoin works, and works well, but it can still be surpassed by a better system, I'd be surprised if the wasn't SOMEONE working on a valid competitor.  It can also fail by lack of use/support (doesn't look likely at this point, after the fork had little impact on use and exchange-rate).  Once BTC is so ubiquitous that it will be hard to imagine life without it, the it has "succeeded".  
I can't find a mission statement for BTC, I suppose meeting those terms (if they exist) would be the easiest way to define success. 
Maybe "success" wasn't the right term.  BTC as a proof of concept has definitely succeeded, as a central bank slayer, not there yet.

I want a CC processing system that charges CC on my site, converts it to BTC and deposits to my BTC account.  I realize there is a big disconnect here between the way CC's work and the way BTC works, so maybe an escrow system?  
I'm already taking the standard gamble with accepting CC's, so waiting a week or so for the BTC escrow wouldn't be a big deal.   So instead of paying Visa 3% to process, I'd pay motivatedinvestor'snewsite.com 1% to process a CC and give me BTC directly.   
conversely, a BTC debit-card, so I don't have to ask merchants if they take BTC, just swipe my card as usual, convert my BTC to $ to pay the merchant through their processor.

Couple options:
1.  Someone is using that address (with private key) and you randomly duplicated it (rare). If you deposit to it, "oh hey! Free coins!  I better move them before they disappear on me!"
2.  Someone is phishing, seeding lots of addresses to catch someone unawares. If you deposit to it, "oh hey! Free coins!  I better move them before they disappear on me!"
3.  someone created it long ago and forgot about it. If you deposit to it, "oh hey! Free coins!  I better move them before they disappear on me!"
Either way, If you deposit to it, "oh hey! Free coins!  I better move them before they disappear on me!". And you lose your coins.

damnit, I need to stop redditing at the gym, screws up my workout and my answers....
I set it up a while ago for $100/wk, forgot all the details.  Since I do the manual pull from camp on Fridays, it automatically starts the re-fund from my bank to dwolla on friday.  
I had found the recurring pmts feature on Dwolla a while ago, havn't set it up or messed with it, but it looks like it will automatically pull from my bank acct and then push to camp. 
under Recurring Payment &gt; Payment, type Ca into the "send to" box and CampBx with their acct # comes up.  Details would be the same as auto-fill when initiated from within Camp.

Whoever WANTS a road from point A, to point B can be in charge. Does not have to be someone calling themselves an "official". 
I have a farm, John has a market, I drive my tractor through the field to get my produce to market. Do that enough tines and there is a 2 track dirt road.  Years later, my farm and john's market have grown, also, our employees have build houses along the path. It gets nasty when it rains, so we decide to pave the road, John and I COOPERATE to get together the money and hire a contractor, or buy supplies/tools and do it ourselves.

That's the nugget right there.  systematic, policy driven inflation is the chief evil of our economy today.  It discourages saving of any sort.   BTC is by nature deflationary, which serves to encourage saving and investment.  That in itself makes it worth it.  Being able to use your savings at any time to any place in the world is an added bonus.

I still don't have a full grasp, and I've been here since Feb.  the only risk I see is short-term, with all the new money + growing pains, crashes will likely happen and if you get twitchy, you could lose out.  Even of the price stabilizes at 25$ ea, if the network is sound, it's a winning situation. 
The value is in the utility, the risk is in te volatility. 
It's possible something better will come along and overtake BTC, it won't be a fast takeover so transferring finds will be possible, and then we have something BETTER than the most amazing thing I HAVE EVER SEEN.

Wow, I did a terrible job of saying what I was thinking. I 100% agree with you about bitcoin, particularly:


but this: 


what did I do to deserve this?
Maybe you were just arguing with someone else that was seriously hating on you and/or BTC, but I'm not that guy. Yes, I'm disappointed I didn't get in at 4 cents, but it's not going to ruin my life. In 2009 I was trying to make it to my next paycheck, not looking for a high risk/reward investment. I wasn't looking for that either when I stumbled on BTC a few weeks ago either, I see it as an opportunity no to be missed.
Let me re-phrase my last post:


as an investment: while it's true you would get better returns if you'd gotten in in '09, just like if you'd gotten in on apple or microsoft early, people are STILL buying those stocks today at their astronomical prices because they see further potential for increasing value in the future.
as a currency: this was answered by the post above me, I can't add to it.

I agree, if looking from a position of relative stability.  
He's at the point where he believes he'll lose it all if he stays where he is.  The Jews that left Germany in the late 30's because they saw the writing on the wall were called crazy by the ones who stayed.  By the time they changed their minds, it was too late.  They could have been proved right, but they weren't, unfortunately.

just because the water-level in the bathtub is going up, does not mean you have to trim the tree.
They are related, as they both affect your house, but one is not tied to the other.  
You can buy a pizza with .25btc, or $12  if the value of BTC remains steady in REAL TERMS, not vs. the dollar you will buy the same pizza for .25btc no matter what the dollar does.
  ~~if~~ *when* the value of the dollar goes to shit, you'll buy that pizza for $100 or more.  you still have a pizza.  The exchange rate has changed, but the $ dropping has not affected the value of BTC (directly, more people will use it, which will raise the value)
BTC may help accelerate the downfall of the dollar, but they are not linked.

Yes, much simpler.  
I'm not an accountant, I actually have mental block against accounting/bookkeeping (both my parents are CPA's... go Freud on that one!)
The way it would make sense to me is: 
* 100% deposit in the ledger of the initial transaction currency, I sent the email invoice in USD, so the initial deposit should be in the USD ledger.
* deduction of fees (FYI, coinbase doesn't charge 1% for an email invoice...)
* transfer to other currency's ledgers per the setup % chosen
* ammt swept to bank acct at end of day from each ledger.
Thanks for the response and obvious desire to improve!  it's refreshing after dealing with PayPal for years.

as a merchant, I've been thinking along these lines, thank you for making it clearer for me.  I had already changed my bitpay to do a 50/50 split.  I now take my pay in BTC and use it as a personal investment.  (I still have a day job).  I had been thinking about offering more than the 10% discount which seems standard, I think I will go that route.

I like to have SOME idea of what you want me to click on (without hovering).  Beter yet, put them as citations at the bottom and don't direct me away from your blog till I've gotten to the bottom of the post. 


Don't assume I'm reading to find your faults, this statement put me into fault-finding mode and wondering why it was there.  Unnecessary to get defensive.
I liked the analogy you made, and now that it's been mentioned, I can clearly see how the bitcoin network is a great example of an [emergent network]( (great book if you havn't read it)
 Wonder if BTC become self aware at some point?

I've got it, 
1.  I establish an auction on bitmit.net for cash transfered by WU (or whatever works best for you) for the price of 1.5BTC at our agreed exchange rate (you mentioned $115, but it's $133 now....)
2.  You buy it with 1.5btc, 
3.  I send money and get a confirmation from whichever service, we are both protected by bit-mit's escrow service.  All recorded anonymously in the open here on reddit ;)
4.  Profit!

Give it 6 months, if it's not changed then maybe assume they're lost coins from long ago?  When was the last transaction?

I agree, but you could also accept BTC at a discount for "spoiled" items and write them off as a total loss.
@_date: 2013-03-17 20:15:34
I agree, like I realized in another comment-chain, maybe successful wasn't the right word. I'm fascinated by BTC, if I had money to invest, it would be 80% in BTC. 


Yep and yep. 
My shopping art host has not yet implemented an integration, so I'm waiting (and pinging them weekly) for it to happen.  They have an API to setup any CC processor imaginable, soon as someone makes a BTC solution on that protocol I'll be on it. I can accept BTC using the purchase order feature and sending a pmt request, but that's inelegant and doesn't fit the flow.   It's not feasible to switch cart hosts at this point, but if they don't get off their ass soon I may.

I've slowly shifted to this line of thought. Started collecting BTC with $100/paycheck, as it's utility increases I've moved to $125/wk and spending some.  This week will be $150 and spend a bit more. 
I figure if the rate is $150 each, and I spend one BTC I bought at $75, and buy another at $150, I still have a cost of $75 as I would've spent the $150 anyway.

I have mine setup to sweep 50% to USD for paying vendors, and keep the rest in BTC for savings/ spending with BTC accepting suppliers (none yet unfortunately, but I'm working on it)

That works but with a steady climb upwards, if you miss at -50 cents today, and buy tomorrow, you could be buying at higher than today's market price.

I agree, getting started is NOT easy.  BTC is still in Beta, entrepreneurs are still learning how to build services on top of the BTC platform. 
I've been here since February and still don't FULLY understand it, and I'm enthralled by the system. 
I finally made my first purchase last week, through blockchain.  10 minutes maybe (not including the drive to CVS to use moneygram).
If you don't trust blockchain's wallet, setup their phone-app, soon as you receive the transfer, send it to your secure address.  
For as new as you are to this ride, you are still considered an early adopter.

They  have a payment API, so it should be no problem for someone that knows what they're doing.  I want to keep CC processing (for now) but PayPal can go.

right, appx 2140, there will be 21million coins mined, ever.  This is expected to happen around 2140, but can't be pinned down.

Same thing that's killing fiat currencies, a better option. If someone studies BTC and improves upon it significantly, it would kill BTC, but what would we be left with?  A better currency.
The US govt can't keep drugs out of jails (secure cages) how can they keep BTC out of the marketplace?  Also, prohibiting drugs works great, prohibiting BTC will be about as effective. 
A serious security flaw could shake the faith in BTC, but unless it's beyond repair, I don't think that would be a death-blow.  Too many geeks in love with it to just let it die.

If lots of local .govs start accepting btc, then that should be significant pressure AGAINST the federal govt banning it.

request has indeed been sent by you, your account will be locked for 2 weeks and any access to the account will be restricted during this period.


to confirm whether you wish to complete the process or not. Should you wish to proceed, the unlinking of the OTP will be completed in 1 week and you may then access your account. Our apologies for the inconvenience caused in the process.

That's what I was gonna suggest, keep a portion of your margin in BTC as an investment.  My shopping art host hasn't setup integration yet, still working on a workaround.

As a merchant, I agree, some stability please
Edit, plus I just put more cheap crap in bitmit

Leaving in a hurry is what causes problems....
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:59:46
They have an escrow service, it handles it all for you.  Opening an acct basically creates a new wallet.  Once sold, the buyer pays into escrow, you ship (with tracking &amp;signature required), when received the buyer releases escrow.  If the buyer is unhappy he returns it and now YOU hold the power of escrow. When you receive it back, in order, ou release the escrow refund. 
I've sold a couple things on bitmit, no problems.

you can't make money if you don't spend money.  I think you gave me my first tip...
@_date: 2013-03-17 20:02:18
Yes, I don't think it's likely BTC will be replaced, but for as much as I like to follow tech and Internet related stuff, (or thought I did) I knew nothing of BTC in January, didnt even dream of something like it, beyond "there has to be a better way". I never envisioned anything close.  So I would not be surprised if something better pops up. It would take a while in adoption, just like BTC, but the curve would be steeper since BTC has broken the barriers. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:51:06

@_date: 2013-02-17 15:30:57
true, but you don't have to buy a full BTC, bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places.  I currently have 0.01038402 BTFC (appx 28 cents...) in my [bit-tip]( account, If I just leave this alone, in a few years I'll have $50.  
Of couse in a few years $50 may be only worth 28 cents today.

I've sold 3 things on BitMit so far, one purchaser wasn't able to buy BTC to pay, so put a note about pmt terms (pmt within 24 hrs, or deposit etc) if you don't want to end up waiting a week to find out you're not getting paid... 
Other 2 transactions were just fine.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:20:08
they probably have a hell of a lot of emails to get through, they didn't have access to their email.  or did you not read the article?

Yes, I've setup the Purchase Order that way, when I add BTC instructions I'll say to put BTC in the PO# field, then I'll send a pmt request in dollar value through BitPay, they'll do the currency conversion.

there you go, have the raffle setup that the coins go to the winner.  The winner goes to pickup the car, and pays in BTC for it.

We're using a shopping cart, over 1/2 of our orders are multiple items, so it'd have to be at checkout from the cart.  Currently there is a button for checkout with CC, another for PP and a 3rd to use a Purchase Order.  Purchase orders will get a BTC request through my BitPay acct.

I signed up for a bitpay acct last week, going through all the verificaions.  My current cart doesn't integrate with bitpay yet, all the pages are dynamically generated so I don't want to use a "buy now" button, I'd have to make them for 250 items.  If I can figure out how to make the button dynamic based on the item on screen, then it may work. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:38:53
$2.60, plus shipping.  1st class on that should be about $1 (US domestic). 
I'll make it $3.25 shipped, since in a week or so those BTC will be $5 :) 
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:17:07
I like their "unique amount" model, but they should do flat-fee, random (by a few cents) deposit ammt.  I actually got though with coinbase, I put in $100, came out at $91 to buy exactly 1 coin.  I wouldn't have minded the .06 btc, but oh well...

@_date: 2013-02-16 15:44:11
Could be, I think the miners hold pmts till its larger, to minimize fees, but since you stopped inputting, they may have just released it as-is. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 17:15:13
sorry, I forgot you posted your wallet.... that's about $2.50?  I'll do it for that and recommend we just let the BTC sit in the wallet (as an "experiment").

the way I understand it, yes.  You just guessed someone's brain-wallet.  probably more than one person using the first line of a favorite book.
You can chose to "re-allocate" those coins into your wallet, or be nice and send them a message that their wallet is insecure.

hmmm, I think using AutoHotkey I can go from code output to wallet, I had actually set that up thinking I could just make an xls of permutations, BEFORE I realized how much of a PITA that would be....  
As others have said, not really worth the time, but would be a good learning experience.  I understand what you're saying, but it's over my head at this point.  I think I can make it work with a lot of copy/paste.

Thanks, I've been trying to figure it out. I'm working a contract, 12hr night shift, 7 days a week, so I'm not doing much.  I'm using my phone as a modem for my ipad in the break room to get online, and for my laptop in my hotel room (no wifi).  I did let a friend connect her iPhone through my wifi hotspot, I doubt she has any idea how to get any info from my phone, but if hers was compromised, maybe?
I havnt logged into my blockchain in about a week either, so it was probably compromised before I let her use the wifi.  
I may be able to use a work computer to change my passwords, it'll definitely be secure, but I might not be able to access blockchain.

Edit: just got an email from coinbase that my purchase went through, 3 days ahead of schedule :). 1 coin @ $93 :)
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:42:23
Someone wrote a bot script that looks for that syntax, and it sends bit coins from one user to another. If you don't already have an acct setup it makes one for you.  Use it to do "more than upvote", put your money where your mouth is, and give real money to encourage great comments (or simply spread the word about bitcoin, as is the case here)
It is also being used for e-commerce, to buy things directly through reddit posts. 
Edit:  
Someone else has made one for twitter and sent BTC to the president with it.

makes sense, how did you do the import though?  I only see one at a time, and you need the address. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:15:51
well, using bit-instant, though zip-zap though money-gram, last week I paid $103, when I got the block-chain text my BTC received was worth $93, some of it may have been fluctuations (over 5 minutes) but I lost 10% in the process, so anything less than that would be good.  The "advertised" fees on the blockchain site for the cash deposit was 3.99%, so that's a good starting point.  I believe in the long-haul, so minor swings here and there don't bother me too much, but one of the big selling points of BTC is low fees.

Reply to a hater, although you deleted it while I was typing:  
It (giving away money) is NOT easy, which is why he had a damn good motive to do it.  Which was *not* because someone else told him he should.  It was because he believes it will benefit him. Either by making him feel better by donating to charity, or by increasing the value of his holdings, or whatever else, it was his motive.

my wife and I run a small jewelry web-shop, I'm going to convince her to add it to pmt options (she does all the front-end, branding etc, I do the heavy lifting).  She's on a trip now, but I will be bringing it up soon as she gets back.  Our shopping cart host doesn't integrate yet, but I've been pinging the feature request forum, and I think I have a manual workaround for now.
A few emails to the tune of: "I'm interested in XYZ but I'd really prefer to pay with bitcoin" would do wonders.

Yes, currency exchange. Just as if you were traveling to Europe, you would purchase Euros at a currency exchange.
But instead of a rapidly inflating fiat money, you're getting a slowly inflating, eventually deflating currency that can be sent around the world for a fraction of a percent in fees, in minutes....

That's kind of the point of Bitcoin, to run peer to peer. Loosing exchanges may slow things down, but it'll run just fine p2p
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:58:14
Not as I understand it, but IANAE. 
Ex, if one hours work yields me $47, because of the exchange rate I can buy 1btc (ballpark, round nubers for clarity).   If the dollar tanks, my pay will double or I will stop working there, so I now make $94/hr.  if the VALUE of BTC stays constant, I would exchange that $95 for 1btc because the exchange rate would automatically adjust because it is a completely open and free market. 
I could also be paid 1 BTC/hr, and depending on how the value of the dollar fluctuates I can buy more or less dollars with my paycheck.  (Guess its not really a check if I'm paid digitally...)
BUT neither the value of BTC or $ is constant.  Inflation (from printing, aka quantitative easing, aka counterfeiting) makes each dollar worth less today than yesterday. In parallel, BTC adoption is ramping up, making it more useful/desirable so more people are buying them, which drives te exchange rate up. So when 1btc = $1000, I can buy a $10 item for 10/1000 of a bitcoin.  Back to the $12 pizza, at a $1000/1 exchange rate, that pizza will probably cost $300. 
The exchange rate doesn't tell you what a BTC is worth, it provides a convenient way to express it in familiar terms. 
At $47/BTC, one Coin is worth appx 3 pizzas.  As more people find BTC useful they will be more valuable and luigi will give you 4 pizzas for your 1 coin.  If the value drops then he'll only give you 2 pizzas /coin. 
That was pretty rambling, I'll edit for clarity when I'm not on my phone..

bitcoins actually slowly deflate.  If a coin is lost (lost wallet, owner dies with no instructions for passing to heirs etc)  the coin is there, but NOT usable.  This causes shrinkage in the usable supply of available coins.

While I disagree with many of your potential outcomes, it is well written and a good discussion-starter, hence the lack of down, IMHO.
BTC may be the trigger event for some of these if they do happen, but wil not be the direct cause. Fiat is failing, whether BTC comes or not, the Feds printing at full speed will ensure fiat's demise. Grandma's savings and SS account will be decimated, by our government.  BTC may speed the process, but not cause it on its own.

The shoppingcart host we're using is pretty good and I've put a lot of work into it, we have 250 items, all dynamically pulled into the proper categories by the setup, so a new necklace automatically gets put into "necklaces" "new" and "jewelry" and "exclusives" if applicable.  I am finding some draw-backs with the site, aside from not having BTC integration yet, so considering moving to Magento to use their MtGox compatibility.

true.  probably about 2038/39...  but the slow and steady rate of supply increase is reassuring, especially in contrast to QE∞

she's a technophobe, telling her about a new "digtal currency" would not be an easy sell.  If a potential customer was saying "here, take my money" I think it would go over much smoother.  We've been together 13 years, I'm getting pretty good at predicting her responses (about technology.)

1. It was just above the website's threshold for flagging, so I called Visa and asked, a live person told me it was fine after checking up on it.  I was stupid enough to believe that was enough to cover me. 
2.  I was so excited to have such a big order, I was blind to it being completely abnormal (aside from the websites fraud flags...).  My average order was $100, biggest orders maxed out at $1000.
 I tricked myself into believing it was legit, especially after reassurance from Visa (well, my CC processor, authorize.net).
3.  I was hungry to grow and overly enthusiastic of that being the turning point.  lesson learned.  Very expensive lesson, but learned.

Well, not always... They got me by stealing ( they called it a tax levy ) money directly from my bank accts for taxes they had already agreed I didn't owe.

I did a backup of the wallet, to save all the current addresses, and downloaded the new version,  it's currently re-indexing what's already downloaded.  Then I'll restore the backup.  If I lose it, it's about 15 cents (which could be quite a bit down the road, or still 15 cents...)  I just didn't want to add to the "lost" coins...

Definitely. So you're saying that by recognizing BTC, they *won't* be doing that?  Sounds similar to, "oh, just register your guns, we won't ever think of confiscating them, wink wink"...

@_date: 2013-03-27 21:05:35


that's the key.  what timeframe are we talking about also?


that's huge.  If the banks don't steal it all, the crash of the currency and banks from the runs will destroy the rest.  May not happen, but very well could.  This is un-charted territory in the modern age, but a collapse is a collapse.  
Decide what you think will be the norm in 5 years, and do that now.  If the world economy is going to be based in BTC, smart money will shift to BTC today.   The hard part is knowing wether you're right or not.  I'm not certain, but pretty well convinced this is where we're heading.

I think it'd be more of finding abandoned property.  If the address hasn't been updated in ages (I'm thinking &gt; 100 years...), it's relatively safe to assume it's been lost.  If someone is interested in keeping their BTC they will keep the storage up to date.

proper Day Traders that have a clue, yes.  "day traders" that buy on the upswings and sell on the dips would tend to increase it, the way I see it.
It's going up, buy! = upwards pressure while going up
It's dropping, SELL!!! = downwards pressure on the way down..
when they finally give up and decide to hold (or leave), *then* that would decrease volatility. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong (no sarcasm, still learning).  This is why I don't day-trade.
