I've tried to hide this truth from him as long as possible but sooner or later someone was going to reveal the meaning.

You provide liquidity by coinjoining your coins with other. If you don't want/need mixing coins, Wasabi provides you a lightweight client that doesn't leak information to any third party, a fine grain coins control, 100% communication over Tor anonymity network, bip84 wallet that prevents address reusage.
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:27:52
Yes, it is. Wasabi made over 152 BTC fungible since August 1, 2018 (during beta testing) and the team was working hard on performance and stabilization. Please visit: [ where you can see the latest coinjoins transactions.

Coins management is key for privacy and that's why Wasabi doesn't select the coins for you as non-privacy-oriented wallets do (Trezor).  So, IMO if you value your privacy you should use Wasabi instead of Trezor. This is because you should never create transactions mixing anonymous and non-anonymous coins (as you already know) and with Trezor that is something that could happen even if you move all your coins to Wasabi, mix them all and move them back to Trezor. You could receive a transaction from someone and then, next time you make a transaction, that transaction can be built with your anonymous coins and the non-anonymous just received coin. Do you understand what I mean? You have no control, you lose your privacy:  
What you can do is the following: move to Wasabi the amount you want to use, mix the coins and then, use them with Wasabi.   
OTOH, Wasabi is not just about mixing and managing coins, it also protects you about network analysis and all kind of data leaks.

Yes, it creates a separate address for the coinjoined coins and it let you know very clearly, with graphic indications, which coins are anonymised and how anonymous they are. Additionally, you must label the coins and indicate which ones you want to send or coinjoin.

We implemented the compact filters as it is specified in the BIP158, using the test vectors for testnet shared with the bip.   
We started coding based on the  first draft but were updating the code immediately after each change made in the bip, we removed the extended filters/headers and changed the default parameters after sipa shared some analysis about the false positive rates.   
The only difference we have with the basic filter implemented in the core client is we only index native segwit txo and we use the first P parameter (20) because its default value was changed after we built the filters and didn't want to regenerate them. Anyway, that's not bad because our FPr is smaller.

Trading assets backed on the blockchain, person to person, frictionless, borderless and with no intermediaries is something we cannot do easily with our bank account currently.

The good part about Schnorr signatures, at least from my point of view, is that they allow to do signatures aggregation, this means combining multiple signatures in only one that doesn't reveal the different signers public keys. But even more important is that having one signature can make our coinjoin transactions cheaper, what is something good in itself.
We implemented a first version for creating/verifying Schnorr signatures into the NBitcoin library just to be ready:
* 
*   
Signatures aggregation would also make P2EP payments, and other similar collectively-built transactions, cheaper.
So, going back to your question: yes, we will begin supporting it as soon as possible.

Imagine a common guy who decided to save in bitcoin. We don't know if he is a brainless man, a time traveler or if he just want to prevent his dictatorial government from confiscating all his property but just for the sack of the story lets say he is a young man who believes bitcoin will go to the moon.
He buys bitcoins face to face from different people always in the same cafe, he doesn't want to open accounts in any exchange because those interfaces are confusing and only traders and techies understand those things. 
After two years of saving month after month he reads some expert in tweeter that says that fees are extremely low and that it is a good opportunity to consolidate all his coins, in that way if fees go high again then those who consolidated their coins will be able to make cheaper transactions than the rest. 
Our saver friend does it, after all he is a believer and there is no doubt in his mind that fees will go very high once the price recovers and get ATH again.
One day he decides to buy a pizza in a new pizza shop that accepts bitcoins. The seller offers a 15% discount if the payment is done with bitcoin so, our guy pays the equivalent to $10 with bitcoins, using his favorite non-privacy oriented wallet. He ignores the fact that after making that small payment the pizza seller knows how much money he has. He also ignores that now all his payments can be watched by that seller. 
What if the pizza seller is not an decent man? But wait a minute. We said that he consolidated his coins, right? That means that all those who sold bitcoins to him can also see how much he has. Who can feel safe exposing all his savings and movements?
This story would be absolutely different with Wasabi wallet if our guy invest just a couple of hours to learn and understand what he does. Imagine he buys bitcoins from some random guy in a bar and set a label on those new coins, something like "purchased to the drunk computer maintainer". He can see how many coins he has, where those coins come from, how big they are and other important data. 
When this guy has to pay for a pizza he can decide which coin/s to use. I mean, he can decide what information he wants to let the pizza seller to know. If he suspects the seller could spy on him for any reason, he can mix the change and prevent that seller to track his futures payments.  


I agree. The brainwashing machine is really heavy and never stops.


We don't need to motivate them. Once they understand that is not a good idea to let everybody to know how much money they have, how often they receive/send money and how much, among other details, they will google for Wasabi (or I hope so)


I am a Wasabi developer, wasabi is the wallet that I use, that means I could have a biased opinion but to me Wasabi is the wallet everybody should use.

If well it's true that this requires an interactive protocol and that that doesn't play well with huge coinjoins of tens of participants as Wasabi does, P2EP coinjoins are interactive too and there is where IMO we should start researching.

That's the idea. Basically there are three (imo) features that will improve the cost of gaining privacy with Wasabi:
1. Schnorr signatures for single signature transactions.
2. CoinJoin unequal outputs.
3. CoinJon while sendind.
You can see the roadmap and additional ideas for Wasabi Wallet here:

Wasabi has a decent liquidity level and it is getting moreand more every day. We are working on providing a even better coinjoin mechanism that is going to allow us to increase the already increasing liquidity. We also expect more users, after all Wasabi is the newest wallet (only 2 months since 1.0.0 release).  
IMO we can achieve more liquidity without additional incentives, I personally believe that if we create a better wallet we won't need to pay for liquidity, as Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't pay for sex (I hop so).

wow good question! Yes because the coin (utxo) is the sameone so, it is unlocked by the same private key (same identity). 
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:51:47
Supporting HW is a recurring topic among Wasabi users. There is listed in the secction \*Accessibility\* of our envisioned plan: [ and in fact there are some interesting discussion at a technical level about integration trezor: [ and coldcard: [   
However, it is not something easy to do because users have to approve the signature of the transactions and that doesn't fit well with our coinjoin feature. So, if well it would be great to suport HW we cannot do it for the moment. Anyway, we have it in mind all the time. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:14:00
I think we are going to have privacy incentives at the protocol level with signatures aggregation, for example. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:59:56
Wasabi gets its blockchain data (blocks) from the bitcoin p2p network. It uses client-side compact filter (bip158) fetched from a central server in order to know which blocks it needs to request to its peers.

No, it is not wrong.

You are assuming Satoshi is a group of people just because you have never reviewed the earlier versions of bitcoin code. Go, take a look at it and them come back and comment again.
